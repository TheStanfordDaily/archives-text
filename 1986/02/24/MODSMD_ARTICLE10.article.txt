## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford students were ar
rested Saturday while participating in
a protest supporting striking Watson
ville cannery workers.
Mario Huerta and Joel Bellenson
were arrested near the Watsonville
police station on charges of par
ticipating in and failing to disperse
from an unlawful assembly.
The two said they were protesting
the "violent arrests" of cannery
workers which they had witnessed
earlier.

Watsonville has been plagued with
strikes since September, when can
nery owners proposed significant cuts
in the salary and benefits for their
employees. Workers have been strik
ing since then in an effort to get an
acceptable contract offer from can
nery management.
Huerta said the charges against
them are unfounded.
"We were standing in the street
supporting the strikers when the
police blockaded the area, chased
down people and randomly arrested
them for no apparent reason," she
said.
Bellenson said: "I can't believe

that the police arrested us down the
street from the police station after we
had already complied with their or
ders and dispersed from the station's
parking lot. ... There was complete
pandemonium. The police were drag
ging people out of stores and houses
and arresting them."
A dispatcher for Watsonville police
last night said, "They may have been
peacefully protesting, but they were
told to disperse many times. And they
didn't. . . . They were protesting in
front of the police station."
Bellenson and Huerta will be ar
raigned on March 19.

"We intend to plead not guilty and
to continue our support for the
strikers because we believe that theirs
is a struggle for basic survival. We en
courage other Stanford students to
join us in our support of the strikers'
cause," they said.
On Sept. 9, 1,700 cannery workers
began the strike by walking out of the
Watsonville Canning Company and
Shaw Inc. to protest a wage reduction
from $6.66 an hour to $4.75 and the
loss of employment benefits. Since
that time, there has been widespread
accusation of police brutality and col
lusion between the police and the
canning companies.
