A spokesperson for the former
vice-presidential candidate told
the ASSU Speakers Bureau
Friday that Ferraro, who was
traveling in Hawaii, was ill and
had to return immediately to New
York, according to members of
the Speakers Bureau.
The cancellation was announced
the day after Ferraro's son, John
Zaccaro Jr., was arrested for pos
session of cocaine at Middlebury
College in Vermont.
Zaccaro, a senior known on
campus as "the pharmacist,"
pleaded innocent Friday in Ver
mont District Court to a charge of
possession of a regulated drug
with intent to sell.
Members of the Speakers
Bureau are hopeful that Ferraro
will reschedule her appearence
sometime before the end of the
academic year. Ferraro's agent
mentioned the possibility of a new
date, and there is a chance that she
may speak here in early May, ac

cording to Mary Thurber,
Speakers Bureau member and
ASSU senator.
The Speakers Bureau plans to
arrange a refund of "over
$10,000" already paid to Ferraro,
according to bureau director
Dixon Osborn. The bureau had
been confining itself to a limit of
$3,000 per speaker, and must
receive approval from the ASSU
Senate in order to spend more
than $2,500, Osborn said.
The contract for the speech
forbade the Speakers Bureau from
revealing how much Ferraro was
to receive for the appearance, ac
cording to Osborn.
About 750 ticket holders will be
eligible for refunds beginning
today, Thurber said. The ASSU
will offer refunds at the lecture
note office in Tresidder Union
during its regular business hours
through Friday.
However, tickets purchased for
tonight's speech will be honored if
Ferraro speaks later this year,
Thurber added.
