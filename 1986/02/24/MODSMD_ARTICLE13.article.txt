The third annual "You Can Make a Difference"
conference was held this weekend at Stanford. This
year's focus — "Private Initiatives and Public Respon
sibilities" — was designed to look at ways in which
businesses, public organizations and individuals can
work toward solving world problems.
Given the gravity of the issues confronting us today
— hunger, poverty at home and abroad, concern over
the quality of our education, the escalating arms race,
the rising federal deficit — this conference served a
very important function. It provided a mechanism
through which the community could be educated about
a variety of issues as well as a forum to address a series
of pressing questions: How does our society establish
its public priorities? What should be the division of re
sponsibility between government and the private sec
tor? What types of incentives are needed to encourage
"private initiatives"? Speakers at the conference also
demonstrated by their own examples that a choice does
not have to be made between "doing good" for those
less fortunate than yourself and "doing well" as a
reward for quality professional work.
In fact, in the past few years, students at Stanford
have themselves recognized the importance of public
responsibilities and their own role in community af
fairs. In many ways, they have made a difference. It is
students who have organized these conferences focus
ing on public service and have planned numerous
public service activities. They have participated in
many events sponsored by the Stanford Volunteer
Network and the Reach Out Today programs.
Students have also tried to make a difference regard
ing various areas of University policy. They have ques

tioned the quality and aim of education at Stanford
through the debate over the Western Culture require
ment, and they have challenged the University's in
vestment policies. Indeed, students have taken to heart
the now oft-heard slogan, "You can make a differ
ence."
This conference, however, also raises the issue of the
University as a force for public responsibility. How has
Stanford established its public priorities? What is it
doing to make a difference? The University has been
quite successful in encouraging students to take in
itiatives and become involved in certain public service
activities, but Stanford as an institution has itself not
heeded the call for public responsibility.
University President Donald Kennedy, in comment
ing on the conference, remarked, "Regardless of our
individual directions, we need to talk together about
the basic public responsibilities that, as citizens, we all
share." But we must go beyond mere talk. We must
take action both as citizens and as an institution to be a
real force for social responsibility.
The first step Stanford can take is to support the
Hewlett-Packard shareholder resolution up for a vote
this week calling for disinvestment from South Africa.
Next we can devise and implement a socially respon
sible investment policy. Stanford must also improve its
affirmative action employment record as well as its re
lationship with the United Stanford Workers.
Students have taken the lead in making contribu
tions to the public welfare through numerous activities.
Now it is time for Stanford to translate its talk and ad
vice into action. Only in this way can wc really make a
difference.
