Painter's criticism
was inappropriate
Peter Painter (Daily, Feb. 20)
needs to be answered too. People like
Stacey Leyton who take the time to
discuss issues of the day should be ap
plauded: Even if one disagrees with
her views, one needn't make state
ments worthy of the McCarthy anti-
American witch hunts. Criticizing
U.S. foreign policy and media
propaganda is usually a sign that one
is active in political issues. Sure, we
can vote (I do, if you want to know),
but if we really want to stop our gov
ernment from sending murderers to
invade other countries, we need to do
so much more. One way to start is to
tell others to be wary of the
propaganda that holds that U.S. in
volvement in other countries is to
"spread democracy." Our installation
of dictators Shah Pahlevi, Marcos and
Somoza can hardly be taken to be
helpful to the local population. When
people in other countries no longer
want to bend to the will of the United
States government, isn't it possible
that they are not Soviet dupes, but
merely want to control their own des
tiny? Countries don't have to be
either for us or against us, and
Americans can criticize government
actions and still be voting citizens
who believe in democracy.
By the way, I found it very interest
ing that Painter says "our nation is
only active in countries where the
local population is being controlled
by power outside its own country .. .
The direction their government is
taking is not their free choice." Yes,

this is often true, but only because it
is the U.S. involvement itself that is
taking the power away from those the
local population would freely choose.

Frosh are lacking
During my years at Stanford 1 have
worked for extended periods of time
on four publications, and I am now
one of the editors of Dial Tone Maga
zine. I am writing to The Daily to ex
press my concern for the future of
student publications on campus.
After speaking with members of
The Daily, the Chapparal, the Aurora
and the staff of Dial Tone, I have
been made aware of the troubling fact
that there are practically no freshmen
and very few sophomores involved in
student publications. The staffs of
these publications are predominantly
made up of seniors who will graduate
in June and leave a literary wasteland
behind them.
I am not sure what has caused this
falling-off of interest in student
publications. It could be academic
pressure, it could be apathy, or it
could be a decline in the number of
creative minds around this place
(something 1 doubt very seriously).
At least four out of five people here
were involved in their high school
newspaper or yearbook at some
point. Where has that interest gone?
This freshman class is smarter than
any preceding class — 1 know, 1 live
in a freshman dorm. But where is
their initiative? The staffs of these
newspapers are very accessible and so

is the money available to produce
these publications.
I hope the freshmen and sopho
mores will read this letter and take
some sort of action. More power to
those few who are already involved,
but where are the rest of you? We
need you. Things are looking bleak.

Policy is disgrace
You rightly quote me as saying that'*
Soviet conduct is such that they can
hardly be considered real members of
the international community (Daily,
Feb. 19). I did not (as some of your
readers might conclude) mean that
other states conduct themselves per
fectly, nor that we should avoid
serious negotiations with Moscow on
various vital issues. My remark was
made in the context of, not even
academician Andrei Sakharov's case,
but of their belated, reluctant and in
complete permission for mixed U.S.-
Soviet families to reunite. This strikes
me as hardly up to the barest mini
mum of tolerable international be
havior, and would have been unheard
of under the Tsar, Mussolini or most
despotisms. We may feel that in these
cases, and with Sakharov and other
democrats too, to make it clear that
the Soviet leadership is disgracing it
self before the world public may in
the long run lead them to realize that
it is in their own interests to change
their behavior. This seems, too, to be
the essential of any real detente.

tell others to be wary of the
propaganda that holds that U.S. in
volvement in other countries is to
"spread democracy." Our installation
of dictators Shah Pahlevi, Marcos and
Somoza can hardly be taken to be
helpful to the local population. When
people in other countries no longer
want to bend to the will of the United
States government, isn't it possible
that they are not Soviet dupes, but
merely want to control their own des
tiny? Countries don't have to be
either for us or against us, and
Americans can criticize government
actions and still be voting citizens
who believe in democracy.
By the way, I found it very interest
ing that Painter says "our nation is
only active in countries where the
local population is being controlled
by power outside its own country .. .
The direction their government is
taking is not their free choice." Yes,

this is often true, but only because it
is the U.S. involvement itself that is
taking the power away from those the
local population would freely choose.

Frosh are lacking
During my years at Stanford 1 have
worked for extended periods of time
on four publications, and I am now
one of the editors of Dial Tone Maga
zine. I am writing to The Daily to ex
press my concern for the future of
student publications on campus.
After speaking with members of
The Daily, the Chapparal, the Aurora
and the staff of Dial Tone, I have
been made aware of the troubling fact
that there are practically no freshmen
and very few sophomores involved in
student publications. The staffs of
these publications are predominantly
made up of seniors who will graduate
in June and leave a literary wasteland
behind them.
I am not sure what has caused this
falling-off of interest in student
publications. It could be academic
pressure, it could be apathy, or it
could be a decline in the number of
creative minds around this place
(something 1 doubt very seriously).
At least four out of five people here
were involved in their high school
newspaper or yearbook at some
point. Where has that interest gone?
This freshman class is smarter than
any preceding class — 1 know, 1 live
in a freshman dorm. But where is
their initiative? The staffs of these
newspapers are very accessible and so

is the money available to produce
these publications.
I hope the freshmen and sopho
mores will read this letter and take
some sort of action. More power to
those few who are already involved,
but where are the rest of you? We
need you. Things are looking bleak.

Policy is disgrace
You rightly quote me as saying that'*
Soviet conduct is such that they can
hardly be considered real members of
the international community (Daily,
Feb. 19). I did not (as some of your
readers might conclude) mean that
other states conduct themselves per
fectly, nor that we should avoid
serious negotiations with Moscow on
various vital issues. My remark was
made in the context of, not even
academician Andrei Sakharov's case,
but of their belated, reluctant and in
complete permission for mixed U.S.-
Soviet families to reunite. This strikes
me as hardly up to the barest mini
mum of tolerable international be
havior, and would have been unheard
of under the Tsar, Mussolini or most
despotisms. We may feel that in these
cases, and with Sakharov and other
democrats too, to make it clear that
the Soviet leadership is disgracing it
self before the world public may in
the long run lead them to realize that
it is in their own interests to change
their behavior. This seems, too, to be
the essential of any real detente.
