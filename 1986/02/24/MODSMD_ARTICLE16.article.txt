# Daily story was in error
## 
### 
Most of us have felt at one time or another that a news
paper story we read was slanted or misleading. But rarely
does one run across a story containing outright lies, a story
in which a reporter not only distorts the facts but dis
regards them, making up news and misleading thousands
of readers. Even more rarely is one able to expose such an
outright deception.
But last week a reporter for The Daily did it — not just
once, but twice. The reporter knowingly misled thousands
of Stanford students, consciously misreporting facts in two
consecutive stories on the same topic.
You may have read them. One appeared last Tuesday
and one on Friday. Their headlines read "Board denies
AASA funds" and "Board revises groups' funds,"

respectively. Both dealt with the ASSU Program Board's
annual funding recommendations regarding two groups:
the Asian American Students Association (AASA) and
the Asian American Activities Center (the Center).
The Program Board is composed of several Stanford
students and has an annual budget of over $100,000.
The function of the board is to fund student groups at
Stanford. The several students who sit on the board —
one of whom happens to be me — examine budgets sub
mitted by various student groups, interview representa
tives of the groups and allocate money to them based on
funding guidelines set by the ASSU Senate.
The process of applying for funds and getting them is as
follows: the board reviews budgets submitted by groups
interested in receiving money and interviews a represen
tative from each group. Members of the board then post
their initial recommendations as to how much money they
think each group should receive. Usually, accompanying
each recommendation are comments briefly explaining
why the board reached the decision it did.
After initial recommendations are posted, groups un
satisfied with the board's recommendation may submit an
appeal to the board. They submit additional information
that either the group feels is pertinent or the board re
quested in its comments accompanying the initial recom
mendation.
The board then reviews all appeals and makes final
recommendations to the senate. A committee of senators
reviews the board's recommendations and submits them,
or revised versions of them, to the full senate for approval.
What happened with AASA and the Activities Center?
Two weeks ago, after reviewing both groups' budgets
and interviewing representatives from the groups, the
Program Board posted its initial recommendations for the
two groups, along with initial recommendations for all
other groups that applied for annual funding. This oc
curred on Sunday, Feb. 9. The dates are important.
The board initially recommended that both groups
receive no money. Both groups were fairly upset with the
initial recommendations and decided to appeal the

hoard's decision. Usually appeals are submitted in writing.
In this case, the groups lobbied to appeal in person and
the board consented.
Four days after the initial recs were posted — Thursday,
Feb. 13 — the Program Board got together for the last
meeting of its annual funding cycle. It heard the appeal by
AASA and the Center, considered written appeals it had
received and made its final recommendations — all in the
same night. After hearing AASA's and the Center's ap
peals, the board decided to revise its inital rec and made
final recs of well over $ 1,000 for each group.
The following Monday (Feb. 17) several Program
Board members, including myself, received telephone
calls from a Daily reporter. The reporter left a message on
my answering machine saying she was "doing a story on
the feud between the Asian students and the Program
Board." Evidently she had spoken with members of the
two Asian groups over the weekend about what had hap
pened the week before. We told her that a week ago the
board had made initial recommendations of zero for each
group, that we had heard appeals from the groups the
Thursday night before, and that we had also revised our
initial recs that night, making final recommendations of
over $1,000 for each group.
The next day (last Tuesday, Feb. 18) a story headlined
"Board denies AASA funds" appeared in The Daily. The
reporter made absolutely no mention of the fact that the
Program Board had revised its initial recommendations
the Thursday before — that the board had voted five days
before to give each group substantial sums of money.
Another story appeared three days later on Feb. 21. Its
headline read "Board revises groups' funds." It said that
the Board had met with AASA members and revised its
initial recommendation, thereby putting "to rest some of
the controversy and confusion surrounding the initial rec
ommendation . . . " The story said that this had occurred
"last night"that.is, on Thursday, Feb. 20. These event*
had actually transpired the week before, on Thursday,
Feb. 13, a fact the reporter was well aware of.
To reiterate, the reporter was very much aware of the
above chronology and facts. She spoke with several mem
bers of the board, including myself, before either story
reached print. After she wrote the first story, the director
of the board even met with the reporter again to go over
the events that had transpired the week before. Yet the
second article appeared on Friday.
What does all of the above mean? To me it means this:
A Daily reporter got hold of some information one
weekend and smelled "controversy," the stuff of which
bold-headlined, sensationalistic stories are made. But as it
turned out, the reporter had missed the boat. The
"controversy" was over before she got wind of it: Days
before she heard about the "feud" between the two Asian
groups and the board, the "feud" was over. An appeal
had been heard, and initial recommendations had been
revised. But that didn't stop the reporter. She just
pretended that it wasn't over yet, that the board hadn't
made its final recommendations, that the "controversy"
was alive and waiting to be sensationalized on the front
page of The Daily.
The reporter lied to thousands of readers in order to
report a story the way she wanted to, giving an impression
of raging controversy — proudly telling readers that she
and The Daily were there to report it.

or revised versions of them, to the full senate for approval.
What happened with AASA and the Activities Center?
Two weeks ago, after reviewing both groups' budgets
and interviewing representatives from the groups, the
Program Board posted its initial recommendations for the
two groups, along with initial recommendations for all
other groups that applied for annual funding. This oc
curred on Sunday, Feb. 9. The dates are important.
The board initially recommended that both groups
receive no money. Both groups were fairly upset with the
initial recommendations and decided to appeal the

hoard's decision. Usually appeals are submitted in writing.
In this case, the groups lobbied to appeal in person and
the board consented.
Four days after the initial recs were posted — Thursday,
Feb. 13 — the Program Board got together for the last
meeting of its annual funding cycle. It heard the appeal by
AASA and the Center, considered written appeals it had
received and made its final recommendations — all in the
same night. After hearing AASA's and the Center's ap
peals, the board decided to revise its inital rec and made
final recs of well over $ 1,000 for each group.
The following Monday (Feb. 17) several Program
Board members, including myself, received telephone
calls from a Daily reporter. The reporter left a message on
my answering machine saying she was "doing a story on
the feud between the Asian students and the Program
Board." Evidently she had spoken with members of the
two Asian groups over the weekend about what had hap
pened the week before. We told her that a week ago the
board had made initial recommendations of zero for each
group, that we had heard appeals from the groups the
Thursday night before, and that we had also revised our
initial recs that night, making final recommendations of
over $1,000 for each group.
The next day (last Tuesday, Feb. 18) a story headlined
"Board denies AASA funds" appeared in The Daily. The
reporter made absolutely no mention of the fact that the
Program Board had revised its initial recommendations
the Thursday before — that the board had voted five days
before to give each group substantial sums of money.
Another story appeared three days later on Feb. 21. Its
headline read "Board revises groups' funds." It said that
the Board had met with AASA members and revised its
initial recommendation, thereby putting "to rest some of
the controversy and confusion surrounding the initial rec
ommendation . . . " The story said that this had occurred
"last night"that.is, on Thursday, Feb. 20. These event*
had actually transpired the week before, on Thursday,
Feb. 13, a fact the reporter was well aware of.
To reiterate, the reporter was very much aware of the
above chronology and facts. She spoke with several mem
bers of the board, including myself, before either story
reached print. After she wrote the first story, the director
of the board even met with the reporter again to go over
the events that had transpired the week before. Yet the
second article appeared on Friday.
What does all of the above mean? To me it means this:
A Daily reporter got hold of some information one
weekend and smelled "controversy," the stuff of which
bold-headlined, sensationalistic stories are made. But as it
turned out, the reporter had missed the boat. The
"controversy" was over before she got wind of it: Days
before she heard about the "feud" between the two Asian
groups and the board, the "feud" was over. An appeal
had been heard, and initial recommendations had been
revised. But that didn't stop the reporter. She just
pretended that it wasn't over yet, that the board hadn't
made its final recommendations, that the "controversy"
was alive and waiting to be sensationalized on the front
page of The Daily.
The reporter lied to thousands of readers in order to
report a story the way she wanted to, giving an impression
of raging controversy — proudly telling readers that she
and The Daily were there to report it.

Most of us have felt at one time or another that a news
paper story we read was slanted or misleading. But rarely
does one run across a story containing outright lies, a story
in which a reporter not only distorts the facts but dis
regards them, making up news and misleading thousands
of readers. Even more rarely is one able to expose such an
outright deception.
But last week a reporter for The Daily did it — not just
once, but twice. The reporter knowingly misled thousands
of Stanford students, consciously misreporting facts in two
consecutive stories on the same topic.
You may have read them. One appeared last Tuesday
and one on Friday. Their headlines read "Board denies
AASA funds" and "Board revises groups' funds,"

respectively. Both dealt with the ASSU Program Board's
annual funding recommendations regarding two groups:
the Asian American Students Association (AASA) and
the Asian American Activities Center (the Center).
The Program Board is composed of several Stanford
students and has an annual budget of over $100,000.
The function of the board is to fund student groups at
Stanford. The several students who sit on the board —
one of whom happens to be me — examine budgets sub
mitted by various student groups, interview representa
tives of the groups and allocate money to them based on
funding guidelines set by the ASSU Senate.
The process of applying for funds and getting them is as
follows: the board reviews budgets submitted by groups
interested in receiving money and interviews a represen
tative from each group. Members of the board then post
their initial recommendations as to how much money they
think each group should receive. Usually, accompanying
each recommendation are comments briefly explaining
why the board reached the decision it did.
After initial recommendations are posted, groups un
satisfied with the board's recommendation may submit an
appeal to the board. They submit additional information
that either the group feels is pertinent or the board re
quested in its comments accompanying the initial recom
mendation.
The board then reviews all appeals and makes final
recommendations to the senate. A committee of senators
reviews the board's recommendations and submits them,
or revised versions of them, to the full senate for approval.
