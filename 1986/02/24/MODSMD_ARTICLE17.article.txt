## Shcharansky not a proper symbol 
### 
I'm writing again to The Daily, this time in
response to Joshua Lipp's letter (Feb. 18) suggest
ing that "Anatoly Shcharansky is a symbol of suf
fering everywhere." If Mr. Lipp really wants to
make someone a symbol of oppression he could
find a more appropriate person. And he himself
seems to be guilty of the act with which he accuses
The Daily — namely, the "selective" approach to
human rights issues.

I don't like to see anyone sent unjustly to prison;
and nine years in Soviet prisons and labor camps is
unarguably a long time. While in prison, however,
Shcharansky was allowed not only to have use of
the library, but also to send and receive letters, and
even to visit with his mother. I wonder how many
other Soviet prisoners are allowed such privileges,
how many are able to communicate with their
families or "demand" the form their own trial will
take? I hardly think Shcharansky qualifies as a
"symbol" of oppression.
Until his arrest in 1977, what was Shcharansky? —
a scientist and a member of the Communist Party.
He did not become a "dissident" until after he was
denied permission to emigrate. So, while I sympa
thize with his sufferings in prison, I do not see him
as some great humanitarian. His shift from playing
his part in the system to opposing the regime seems
to have been more prompted by personal reasons
than by humanitarian concern for others.
I do agree with part of Lipp's argument: "The
theory of gatekeeping — the subjective selection of
what is news by the media who report it — is clearly

at work here. When we agree to fight injustice, we
should do it wholeheartedly, not selectively." In
fact, I expressed very similar views in an earlier
(not printed) letter to The Daily. However, the
point of Mr. Lipp's letter is that The Daily should
give more coverage to the "injustice of Soviet
Jewry." Doesn't he see the exclusiveness, the selec
tivity inherent in this statement? Why only Soviet
Jews? "What of the other ethnic and religious
groups beneath the Soviet thumb?" write two
editors of The New Republic, "is their fate any less
important than the fate of the Jews?" Lipp echoes
this question when he asks "Can it be that some
people are 'more oppressed' than others?" But by
concentrating exclusively on the Jews of the Soviet
Union, his own answer seems to be "yes." I still do

How many other Soviet
prisoners are allowed
such privileges?

not understand why so many people think that Jews
(less than 1 percent of the total population of the
Soviet Union) are the only oppressed people there.
It is truly a shame that no one wants to question
this ignorance. A study of relevant statistics would
show that while Jews form but a small percentage
of the total number of known political and religious
arrests in the Soviet Union, they have traditionally
constituted a high percentage (especially relative to
their proportion of the population) of Communist
government officials.

It Mr. Lipp really wants to avoid the charge of
selectivity, he should encourage the spread of in
formation on the violation of rights of all peoples of
the Soviet Union, not just the Jews. Who ever
speaks up against the oppression of the Moslems in
the Soviet Union? Perhaps as much as one-fourth
of all anti-religious propaganda in the Soviet Union
is anti-Islamic in nature. Where are the protests
against the arrest of Baptists, against the closing of
Orthodox Churches, and against the denial of
emigration rights to other non-Jewish elements of
the population who desire to leave?
In spite of the sufferings Shcharansky undoubt
edly experienced, let's not make him into a
"symbol." He was, after all, a Soviet Communist
before he became a "Jewish dissident." If a repre
sentative of injustice or protest is necessary, there
arc certainly other people more appropriate. The
media here is full of articles about "Soviet dissi
dents" Sakharov and Shcharansky; but what about
people like Father Dmitri Dudko and Father Gleb
Yakunin arrested in 1980 and 1979, respectively,
for religious and "dissident" activity? Dozens of
other people like these two priests were opposing
the injustices of the Soviet regime and advocating
religious freedoms while Shcharansky was a dues
paying member of the Komsomol (Young Commu
nist League).
I agree, let us fight injustice "wholeheartedly,
not selectively." That means that the case of
Shcharansky is not "more important" than that of
Yuri Orlov or of Dudko. That means that we
should protest equally the plight of the Christians,
the Moslems, the Jews and the other religious and
non-religious victims of Soviet oppression.
