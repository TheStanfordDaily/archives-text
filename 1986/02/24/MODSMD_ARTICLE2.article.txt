A toxic chemical spill in the Stauffer 111

forced two students to flee the building, hut
caused no injuries or damage.
A chemistry graduate student who asked
not to be named said that he was working in
a second floor laboratory at about 4:30 p.m.
when he dropped a sample tube containing
200 milliliters of cyanogen, a derivative of
cyanide. The container shattered on the
floor, releasing the lethal gas.
He and another graduate student, the only
other person in the building at the time, im
mediately left and called the fire department.
Although the fire department called in the
Santa Clara County Hazardous Response
Team and took precautions to protect
firefighters from the chemical, the cyanogen
dissipated and escaped through the build
ing's duct system probably in 30 to 40
seconds, according to Jon Moldestad, health
and safety specialist for University risk man
agement.
When members of the hazardous materials
team entered the laboratory, they found the

broken sample tube but no sign of the chemi
cal, according to firefighter Hal Rooney.
Equipment designed to detect the presence
of hazardous hemicals revealed no trace of
cyariogcn ga* anywhere in the ftllilding* he
said.
Firefighters dressed in sealed white suits
and carrying oxygen equipment swept up the
glass and carried it away in a plastic bag.
The two students and firefighters said that
the small quantity of gas that escaped
reduced what otherwise might have been a
serious spill.
"Cyanogen is very toxic. . . . Had it been a
larger quantity. . . , it could have been pretty
serious," Moldestad said. "With that kind of
accident, there was very little chance of any
Igas remaining in the labj."
But despite the small quantity, "If [the
student] had gotten a good breath, he could
have been killed."
The student who dropped the container
said. "We only deal with small quantities at a
time. ... But, [cyanogen] is fatal if there's
high exposure."

there was no danger from remaining
gas, they treated the incident as a drill
in order to be better prepared for
future incidents, according to Stan
ford Police Sgt. Rick Tipton.
Moldestad said there are an
average of four chemical-related
emergencies each week at Stanford,
but Tipton said that of four possible
spills reported this week, the Stauffer
incident was the only "valid" one.
In an incident on Saturday after
noon, firefighters evacuated the earth
sciences building after a student re
ported smelling suspicious fumes.
However, the smell was caused by
chemical fumes released through the
building's ventilation system recir
culating through the intake system
and was no cause for alarm, according
to Moldestad.
