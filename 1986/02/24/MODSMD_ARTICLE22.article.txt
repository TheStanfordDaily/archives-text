## Stanford miscues give Santa Clara split 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
The Santa Clara Broncos put their hooves down yester
day at Sunken Diamond.
The ninth-ranked Stanford baseball team had made the
Broncos look like donkeys in a I 9-2 blowout on Saturday,
and Santa Clara came out snorting mad yesterday. Taking
advantage of starting pitcher Wes Bliven's thoroughbred
performance and numerous Cardinal sms in the field and
on the bases, the Broncos held off two late Stanford
threats to upset the Cardinal 5-2 and even the series at 1-
1.
The weekend's split moves the Cardinal's season record
to 10-4. Santa Clara goes to 4-4 on the year.
Stanford took the field in a generous mood yesterday.
They began the first inning with a spiffy double play, but
promptly proceeded to stake the Broncos to an early lead
with three unearned runs.
Cardinal starter Al Osuna hit the Broncos' Steve Clin
ton with a pitch and Stanford shortstop Frank Carey
booted Ray Williamson's grounder. Then Todd Gates'
single became a two-run fiasco when the Cardinal muffed
a rundown ot Gates between tirst and second, allowing
Williamson to score from third. Gary Maasberg drove in
Santa Clara's third run with a sharp double down the left
field line, and the Broncos never looked back.
Stanford's Mark Davis answered in the bottom of the
first with a tremendous two-out solo home run to deep
centerfield. But that was the last of the Cardinal's scoring
until the seventh. Bronco starter Bliven (3-D on the vear)
mixed his pitches masterfully, and though he walked six in
six innings, he allowed only three hits, and the Cardinal
rarely advanced a runner beyond first base.
Meanwhile, the Broncos eked out two more runs off
Osuna in the third, capitalizing on two walks, a Gates
double, another Cardinal fielding error, and Mike
Medeiros' sacrifice fly to move the score to 5-1.
Stanford mustered its first real threat in the seventh.
Shortstop Frank Carey led off the frame with a double
over third base. The tiring Bliven was relieved by sidearm

slinger Ron Vogt, who plunked Toi Cook with his first
pitch and then walked Ruben Amaro to load the bases
with no outs. That brought the tying run to the plate in the
person of the hot-hitting Davis. But Davis grounded into
a double play that drove in the Cardinal's second run but
effectively snuffed the rally.
With reliever Rob Wassenaar doing a splendid job of
silencing the Santa Clara bats over the last four innings of
the game, Stanford was still alive as it came to bat in the
bottom of the ninth.
With one out. Cook was again hit by a Vogt pitch, and
Amaro hit an opposite-field double down the left field
line. That put men on second and third, and once more
Davis came to the plate representing the tying run. Santa
Clara brought in righthander Dave Heinevetter, and
Davis popped up to shallow right. Cook tagged up.
charged halfway to home, thought better of it, and was
nailed retreating to third to end the game.
That game-ending gaffe was typical of the Cardinal's
clumsy play all afternoon. Stanford had two men picked
off first base by Bliven, left nine men on base, and com
mitted a total of four errors.
Saturday's game was a lot rosier, but no masterpiece,
either. Starter Jack McDowell struggled all game long,
holding the Broncos to four hits in seven innings but
walking six while the Cardinal fielders committed five er
rors behind him. McDowell, battling the flu, expertly
pitched his way out of several jams, though, and the
Broncos ended up stranding 12 runners in six innings.
The saving grace of the game was the Cardinal's hitting.
It Stanford's bats whimpered yesterday, they thundered
on Saturday, battering Santa Clara's hurlers for 19 hits,
including nine extra-base shots.
The onslaught was punctuated bv Davis, who ripped a
double and two triples. One of those three-baggers was a
bases-loaded rope to the centerfield fence that highlighted
Stanford's ID-run seventh inning.
Designated hitter Mike Deßenon was also a standout
for the Cardinal. At the Beta Theta Pi formal on Friday
