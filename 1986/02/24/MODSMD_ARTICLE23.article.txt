## Hoopsters will try to end 34-year drought at UCLA

I.OS ANGELES — It was named
Edwin W. Pauley Pavilion after the
regent of the University of Califor
nia who donated more than $1 mil
lion to help build it lor the basket
ball team at the university's Los An
geles campus.
It was built in 1965, when the
UCL'A 13ruins were beginning the
most legendary dynasty in the his
tory of the sport. Ten NCAA cham
pionship banners hang from the
rafters, surrounding one signifying
last year's National Invitational
Tournament (NI P) title.
The Stanford men's basketball
team has visited Pauley 20 times
since it was built. The Stanford
men's basketball team has lost 20
times at Pauley. The Cardinal s last
win over UCLA in Los Angeles
came in 1952 — 34 years ago — by
a 73-71 count.
But the past is hisory. Gone arc
Lew Alcindor, Hill Walton. Keith
Wilkes, (Jail Goodrich and Marques
Johnson. Gone too are the days of
Bruin dominance over the rest of
the Pacific 10 Conference.
This year, the Bruins are in a tie
for fifth place with Oregon State at
7-7 in the Pac-10, and they are 13-
13 overall. As the defending cham
pions. they seem assured of an NI L
berth, but their next five games will
determine that.
"If our record is not above .500,
we'll not be going to a tournament."
UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard said.
"That is not. We will not be going
because we will not deserve to go
into postseason play."
Stanford, meanwhile, would like
nothing better to take that Ni l bit
away from the Bruins. If you think
34 years without a victory in
Wcstwood is a long time, then the
44 years since Stanford's last
postseason tournament berth is a
virtual eternity.
I he Cardinal is in as good a po
sition as it could hope for after suf

In its 20 games at Pauley Pavilion, victory has always managed to elude the grasp of Stanford. In fact,
the Cardinal has not beaten UCLA on the road since 1952, or 14 years before center Eric Reveno was
born.
in a two-way tie with the Bears for
third place after its 61-59 victory
over USC at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena coupled with Cal's
76-63 loss to UCLA.
Stanford is 7-6 in the Pac-10,
13-12 overall. The Cardinal is 3V2
games behind league leaders
Arizona and Washington.
UCLA and Oregon State
dropped out of that tie for third by
losing on Saturday. Washington
handed the Beavers a 55-53 loss in
Corvallis, while the Bruins went
into the Sports Arena and
dropped a 79-64 decision to the
ninth-place Trojans.
UCLA has had its problems
inside, with center Jack Haley
averaging only four points-per
game and forward Craig Jackson
averaging six. On Saturday, USC
outrebounded UCLA, 35-24, and
USC's forwards Derrick Dowell
and Hank Gathers combined for
34 points.
Hazzard was understandably

unhappy. "We did not rebound
today," he said. "Rebounding
takes effort and determination."
With its problems inside, the
Bruins have lived and died by the
outside shot. Forward Reggie Mil
ler continues to make his case for
Pac-10 Player of the Year honors,
averaging 25.3 points per game,
including a 29-point effort Satur
day.
Guard Montel Hatcher is next
at 13 points an outing, and guard
Pooh Richardson, averaging 11.3
points and 6.8 assists per game,
has probaby locked up a spot on
the Pac-10 All-Rookie Team.
In the first meeting last month
at Maples Pavilion, guard Novian
Whitsitt scored 19 points to lead
Stanford to a 76-70 victory. Guard
Todd Lichti, also a good bet to
make the All-Rookie team, had
18, and forward Greg Butler had
14.
The Cardinal also hasn't swept
the Bruins since 1942, the season
it won its only NCAA champion
ship. Stanford was 4-0 against
UCLA that year.
