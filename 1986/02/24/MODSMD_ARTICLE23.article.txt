I.OS ANGELES — It was named
Edwin W. Pauley Pavilion after the
regent of the University of Califor
nia who donated more than $1 mil
lion to help build it lor the basket
ball team at the university's Los An
geles campus.
It was built in 1965, when the
UCL'A 13ruins were beginning the
most legendary dynasty in the his
tory of the sport. Ten NCAA cham
pionship banners hang from the
rafters, surrounding one signifying
last year's National Invitational
Tournament (NI P) title.
The Stanford men's basketball
team has visited Pauley 20 times
since it was built. The Stanford
men's basketball team has lost 20
times at Pauley. The Cardinal s last
win over UCLA in Los Angeles
came in 1952 — 34 years ago — by
a 73-71 count.
But the past is hisory. Gone arc
Lew Alcindor, Hill Walton. Keith
Wilkes, (Jail Goodrich and Marques
Johnson. Gone too are the days of
Bruin dominance over the rest of
the Pacific 10 Conference.
This year, the Bruins are in a tie
for fifth place with Oregon State at
7-7 in the Pac-10, and they are 13-
13 overall. As the defending cham
pions. they seem assured of an NI L
berth, but their next five games will
determine that.
"If our record is not above .500,
we'll not be going to a tournament."
UCLA Coach Walt Hazzard said.
"That is not. We will not be going
because we will not deserve to go
into postseason play."
Stanford, meanwhile, would like
nothing better to take that Ni l bit
away from the Bruins. If you think
34 years without a victory in
Wcstwood is a long time, then the
44 years since Stanford's last
postseason tournament berth is a
virtual eternity.

In its 20 games at Pauley Pavilion, victory has always managed to elude the grasp of Stanford. In fact,
the Cardinal has not beaten UCLA on the road since 1952, or 14 years before center Eric Reveno was
born.
