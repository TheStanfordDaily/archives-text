## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
With two of its top players slump
ing. the Stanford women's tennis
team appeared to be primed to lose
its first two Pacific West Conference
matches and its No. 1 ranking this
weekend in Arizona.
But freshman Eleni Rossides
picked up the Cardinal in two critical
situations as Stanford held off
Arizona State 6-3 Friday and
Arizona 5-4 on Saturday.
Today, the Cardinal hosts San Jose
State at 1:30 p.m.
USC, which currently shares the
top ranking with Stanford, was upset
Thursday by San Diego State, leaving
the Cardinal in position to take over
sole possession of the No. 1 spot
when the new rankings come out.
"I'm glad to be out (of Arizona)
with a couple of wins." Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "They
were tougher than we expected them
to be."
Because of the persistent storm
that drenched the Bay Area last
week, the Cardinal had not played a
match since Feb. 10. The lack of
practice hurt some of the players, ac
cording to Brennan.
"The weather really held us up,"
he said. "We didn't have a whole lot
of match experience going in."
Junior Patty Fendick and freshman
Marianne Werdel seemed most af
fected by the layoff. Fendick. the No.
4 singles player nationally, lost to

ASU's Shcri Norris 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 to
put the Cardinal in a hole Friday.

Tittle was victorious at No. 6 for the
Cardinal, hut junior Stephanie
Savides was upended at No. 5 by
ASU's Beth Smigel, 6-1, 5-7, 6-0.
With the Sun Devils leading 3-2 in
the team score, the only unfinished
singles match was between Rossides
and ASU's Allvson Ingram. Down in
the third set, Rossides fought back for
a 6-3, 4-6. 6-4 victory.
"Eleni was really key." Brennan
said. "She was down in the third set.
For a while it looked like we were
going to be down 4-2."
Having evened the match at 3-3,
the Cardinal decided the match by
sweeping the Sun Devils in doubles
play.
Saturday's singles competition
against Arizona were almost a repeat
of the previous day's action. Fendick
lost again, this time in straight sets to
the Wildcats' Jill Smoller. Werdel fell

6-0.
