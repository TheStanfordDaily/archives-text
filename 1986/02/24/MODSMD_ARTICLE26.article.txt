Invasion U.S.A.
International volleyball came to Maples Pavilion on Friday, as both U.S. national teams were
in action before a sellout crowd. The presence of many members of the 1984 gold-medalist
U.S. men's squad and silver medal-winning women's team gave the evening an Olympic air.
The men were upset by Cuba in four games, but the women routed Canada in three.
