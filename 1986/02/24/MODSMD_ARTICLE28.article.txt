Maples Pavilion played host to a sold-out crowd and
top-flight international volleyball action Friday night, as
the U.S. men's national team fell to Cuba and the U.S.
women's national team beat Canada in the Sun Country
Cooler International Challenge.
The men s team, playing without Olympian Pat Powers,
who was competing in Brazil, lost in four games to an im
pressive Cuban squad, 12-15, 15-12, 10-15, 11-15. The
United States had met the C Ã¼bans three times previously
during the week and had won all three matches, the first
two (at Omaha and Seattle) in four games and the third
(at Portland) in five.
The No. 1-ranked U.S. team expected to have a diffi
cult time with the Cubans. "These Cubans should be on a
NBA or an NFL team," said U.S. team captain Karch
Kiraly. They are all 6-foot-5 or more, strong and tre
mendous leapers. 1 find them tougher than the Russians,
mainly due to their overall physical strength."
Kiraly, a member of the 1984 gold medal squad (there
are seven Olympians on the national team) and most
valuable player at the 1985 World Cup (which the United
States won for the first time ever), is a finalist for the 1985
Sullivan Award.
He led the Americans in kills Friday with 33. Steve
Timmons recorded 33 for the United States as well, in
cluding 14 from the back row.
For Cuba, team captain Carlos Ruiz had 20 kills and
made only one hitting error. Ricardo Goicolnea scored 18
kills and Abel Sarmientos came up with 16.
"We got complacent after beating them three straight,"
Kiraly said. "Their offense was really potent tonight."
"We played a little rough," Olympic setter Dusty
Dvorak said.'Tt's hard to go out every night and play well.
Cuba has a very good team and it's the beginning of the
season. The team is shaping up real good. We'll be playing
well in six or seven months. Right now we're playing with
out players and having our ups and downs."
"We know each other pretty well now," U.S. coach
Marv Dunphy said. "This is the fourth time we've faced
them and we've had four dog fights. They played real well
and we're capable of playing better. We made too many
service errors."
The loss broke an 11-match winning streak for the
men's team. Last year, when the United States went 56-

11, the Cubans handed the squad four losses.
Olympian Craig Buck, the Americans' tallest player at
6-foot-8, missed much of the match after being accidently
kicked in the mouth by teammate Bob Ctvrlik during the
second game. He returned late in the fourth game after
receiving stitches.
The U.S. women's team fared better, downing the
Canadians for the third straight time, 15-7, 15-4, 15-13.
Under coach Taras Liskevych, the squad is in a rebuild
ing stage, as there is not a single holdover from the 1984
silver medal Olympic team. The United States was 25-20
in international competition last year after a 2-10 start,
won the prestigious Taurus Cup in Hungary, and finished
1985 among the top eight teams in the world.
Team captain Jayne McHugh, who played under Lis
kevych at the University of the Pacific, had an outstanding
evening for the Americans, with 10 kills and eight blocks.
Middle blocker Marsha Bond had eight kills and six
blocks. The U.S. women had a team hitting percentage of
.577, while Canada hit only .140.
"It was great, the best played of the three matches,"
McHugh said. "It was a good team effort and everyone
played a lot. We were passing well and the sets were there.
It was real nice; this is our first test and we're shaping up
well."
"We controlled the momentum and did what we do well
tonight," Liskevych said. "If we block and pass as well as
we did tonight, not many teams can stop us. We've im
proved dramatically, we're a good international volleyball
team. The U.S. will be in the top two or three in a year."
There was more volleyball action this weekend, as the
Stanford men's volleyball team travelled to Chico State
for a non-conference match. The Cardinal won 16-14, 15-
8, 15-3, to go to 7-3 overall. The squad is 5-3 in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Volleyball Association and is
ranked fourth in the nation.
Freshman Dave Johnson and sophomore Brad Nelson
both played well in the Stanford victory, and senior Ail-
American Jon Root saw action for the first time in two
weeks after missing four matches with an ankle sprain.
"Dave and Brad both came in and did a really good
job," Stanford setter Steve Modory said. "Dave put away
the last point and Brad served really well in the third
game. Jon adjusted well, but he had a little trouble hitting
from the back row. We should be at full strength against
(No. 2) UCLA on Wednesday, and we have a good
chance of beating them."
