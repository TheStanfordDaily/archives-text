## Men record nation's '86 best at home 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Although technically we are in the middle of winter,
in terms of Stanford men's gymnastics we have entered
the spring, according to coach Sadao Hamada.
"I look at my life and my coaching like the seasons
.. . we (the team) are blooming now," Hamada said.
"Blooming" means recording the No. 1 score in the
nation thus far. Last night, the Cardinal scored a 281.5,
destroying the former best, set by UCLA last week, by
2.2 points.
The meet was a gymnastics festival, with six teams
performing, meaning each apparatus was being used
throughout the evening. All eyes, though, were on
Stanford.
The final results of the Hobee Invitational had Stan
ford in first, followed by California with 273.4 points,
Michigan with 267.45, Georgia at 263.05, UC-Santa
Barbara at 251.25 and UC-Davis with 246.5. The
Cardinal, with an insignificant tri-meet win Saturday
night, is 14-2.
Stanford's performance was highlighted by consis
tent excellence in all the events. No one performer

stood out. Statistically, it was Randy Besosa leading
the wav with an all-around score of 56.95.
Fellow U.S. national team member Jon Louis was
close behind at 56.85. Mike Matzek added almost two
points to his personal best, scoring 56.4 points.
The finest single event score of the evening was
earned by Louis in the floor exercise. Cal's Bob
Sundstrum equalled Louis in that same event. On the
high bar, Besosa and Louis wowed the crowd with
back-to-back scores of 9.75.
Stanford came into the meet looking for a team
score of 280-plus, and it was apparent early in the meet
that it was on its way.
"I knew after we hit the first four events that this was
it... we just had to hit the pommel," co-captain Mark
Arnold said.
I he pommel horse, the Cardinal's weakest event this
season, was the team's final apparatus last night. Com
ing into it, the squad needed a 44.85 to reach its goal.
Freshman Scott Schaffer started it off with a 9.1, and
Stanford didn't let up. Their final team score was
46.35.
"We had no choice but to hit it," sophomore Chuck
Gerardo said. Gerardo led the way with a 9.6.
