## 
### MARSH McCALL Senior staff writer 
Yelena Bonner, wife of Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov, will visit
the University this week for an infor
mal one-day meeting with Stanford
scientists who have been active in ef
forts to free her husband from exile in
the Soviet Union.
According to the Times Tribune,
Bonner will visit Stanford on Friday,
but Bonner's son-in-law, Efrem
Yankelevich, refused to confirm the
date.
Physics Prof. Sidney Drell, who will
be handling Bonner's Stanford visit,
yesterday refused to reveal who she
would see and what she would do
during her brief stay.
"She can't meet with the press,"
Drell said. "It's one of the conditions
of her visa."
Bonner, who was allowed to leave
the Soviet Union last year to undergo
open-heart surgery in the United
States, will engage in "a private
meeting between friends," said Drell,
who is the deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
"I think it should stay that way,"
said Drell. declining to comment fur
ther.
Soviet History Prof. Alexander
Dallin was secretive as well, saying
yesterday that he had "nothing [he]

can tell" of Bonner's visit.
Yankelevich, who is quoted in the
Feb. 21 San Jose Mercury News as
saying that Bonner intends "mostly to
visit good friends and be with . . . the
colleagues who supported
[Sakharov]," told The Daily yester
day in a telephone interview from his
home in Newton, Mass. that Bonner
is recovering slowly from surgery and
would be traveling alone.
"I don't think I should say anything
else," Yankelevich said.
Sakharov, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1975 and is currently
exiled in the closed city of Gorky be
cause of his attacks on Soviet human
rights violations, has been issued an
open invitation to speak at Stanford
by a group of Stanford students and
faculty, preferably during Com
mencement week in June.
Drell, who earlier this month
publicly called upon Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev to free Sakharov
and Bonner from exile and allow
them to emigrate to the West, or at
least restore citizenship privileges to
the two, said last week that he consid
ered the invitation "a lovely gesture."
Sakharov has "the courageous
voice of the conscience of mankind"
and has made "seminal contributions
of crucial importance to our quest to
understand the evolution of the uni
verse," Drell said.
