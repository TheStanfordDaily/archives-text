### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
After a somewhat slow start to its
road trip Friday at Fullerton State,
the Stanford women's gymnastics
team picked up speed and garnered
a high score of 180.85 in Albuquer
que.
Though not enough to beat New
Mexico's meet-winning mark of
181.90, the Cardinal's Saturday
night score opens the door to a pos
sible spot in the NCAA regionals to
be held April 4-5 in Corvallis, Ore.
Despite some strong perfor

mances Friday night at Fullerton
State, the Cardinal failed to score
higher than 177, three full points
lower than Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina hoped for.
Sophomore Alison McGann had
a fine meet. "Alison was coming
back from the flu and got a 9.4 on
the vault," teammate Sheri Even
son said, "which led to a good team
vault score."
Evenson herself had a good per
formance, getting the third highest
score on the floor event.
Saturday was the night for fresh
men. Cheryl Doo came in first on

floor. Jinny Rhee topped the list for
uneven parallel bars, and Laurence
George was second on the balance
beam.
The upperclassmen put in some
noteworthy performances as well:
senior Pam Blom scored a 9.15 on
bars, and junior Nancy Goldsmith
"put in a fine all-around effort,"
according to freshman Jessica
Armstrong.
Though Stanford lost to New
Mexico, the women beat Illinois,
which only scored 175.00. The
Cardinal is now 8-9 for the season.
