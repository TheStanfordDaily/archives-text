# Bruins pull away in 2nd half

LOS ANGELES — Last month, when the UCLA
women's basketball team visited Stanford, the Bruins
jumped out to a 19-point halftime lead and then had to
hang on for a 65-62 victory.
Saturday, here at Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins took the
opposite course of action. UCLA scratched out a 26-24
haltime lead, then outscored Stanford 39-19 in the second
half to post a 65-43 Pac-West Confrernce triumph in front
of 425 spectators.
With the loss, Stanford falls to 0-6 in the Pac-West, 11-
14 overall. The Cardinal has lost its last nine games in a
row. UCLA improved to 3-4, 11-15 overall.
UCLA guard Jaime Brown was the only Bruin to score
in double figures, but she was the only one who had to.
The 5-foot-9 sophomore shot 13-of-17 from the field en
route to a career-high 28 points.
"The last game it was the other way around," Brown
said, referring to the Bruins' 81-68 loss to BYU last Wed
nesday. "I wish I just could have evened things out."
Despite Brown's 14 first-half points, the Cardinal kept
close with a tenacious press that forced 12 Bruin turn
overs in the first 20 minutes. Then Stanford forgot to
come out for the second half. UCLA opened up an 18-6
run in the first seven minutes of the half, including 12 un
answered points in a four-minute stretch, to take a 44-30
lead. Stanford never got closer than 10 again.

"I think we cooked ourselves," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Then they started playing better. We
should have left at halftime.
"I remember there were turnovers the first three times
down court. It was just poor passing, not handling the ball
well. Defensively, they got going pretty well. They played
a straight 2-3 — it was just turnovers."
"There were two things we talked about at halftime,"
UCLA Coach Billie Moore said. "First, we had to do a
better job of taking care of the ball — we had eight un
forced turnovers in the first half. The second thing was
that we sent them to the free throw line too often. We
wanted to take away that aspect and make them score
over us."
UCLA did that, sending Stanford to the line 11 times in
the first half and only two in the second.
Center Jill Yanke led Stanford in scoring again with 12
points. Guard Virginia Sourlis and forward Kami Ander
son each had eight.
"I think our switching defenses gave Stanford trouble,"
Moore said. "We wanted to take Yanke away, and we
wanted to take Sourlis away, and we did a pretty good job
of that."
The Cardinal's top two scorers, Yanke and Sourlis,
combined for just nine points in the second half.
The Cardinal wasn't entirely out of the game for most
of the second half, but when Yanke fouled out with 7:45
to play, UCLA doubled its 45-34 lead into the final 22-
point margin.
