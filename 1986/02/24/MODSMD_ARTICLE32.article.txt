GM moves against apartheid
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — In an unusual anti-apartheid
move, General Motors Corp. said yesterday it would give legal aid to any
non-white employee charged with swimming at whites-only beaches.
Bob White, manager of GM's plant in the southern city of Port
Elizabeth, said "legal and financial assistance" would be provided to any
of its 1,800 black and mixed-race employees prosecuted for using
segregated beaches.
GM pays taxes to maintain beaches, "yet 60 percent of our employees
can't use them," White, who was born in Chicago, said in a telephone in
terview.
"I am trying to take some action, hopefully get the local authorities to
get rid of some of the apartheid regulations they apply in Port
Elizabeth," he said.
The Eastern Province Herald quoted Chris Meyer, an archcon
servative lawmaker, as saying GM's move "is bedeviling race relations.
What will happen if people like me, and there are lots of them, decide to
boycott General Motors cars?"
White said GM officials in Detroit did not know initially about his
move but later told him they support it. GM, whose only South African
plant is in Port Elizabeth, employs 3,000 people, including 1,200 whites.
The Sunday Star, a Johannesburg newspaper, said it was the first time
a foreign-based company operating in South Africa had taken such an
action against apartheid.
Segregated beaches are basic to local government apartheid, and a
Port Elizabeth city subcommittee has recommended municipal inspec
tors be empowered to press charges against any non-white found on a
whites-only beach.
Soviet spy satellite may crash
HAMBURG, West Germany — A West German newspaper reported
yesterday that a Soviet spy satellite, possibly powered by an atomic reac
tor, is out of control and could crash on Earth next month.
The mass-circulation daily Bild, quoting two West German space ex
perts, said Cosmos 1714 was reeling toward a fiery re-entry in the at
mosphere and that parts of it could plunge to Earth between March 21
and 25.
There have been no Soviet reports of problems with Cosmos 1714.
Gorbachev to unveil reform plan
MOSCOW — On the eve of the 27th Soviet Communist Party
Congress, which opens here tomorrow, a mood of expectation has
gripped this huge country and its capital that Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev, at the helm of a new post-Brezhnev generation, will use the oc
casion to launch an era of social and economic change.
The mood is hardly coincidental.
In nearly every public appearance in his 11 months in office, Gorba
chev has given the event a plug.
The Soviet leadership has employed propaganda, exhortation and ex
ample to build up this congress as a historic occasion.
It has trumpeted the event with red-and-white placards plastered from
Vladivostok to Yalta, countdown calendars posted in factories and
schools from Siberia to Moldavia, nightly television news spots and a
daily diet of congress-oriented features and editorials in Pravda, Izvestia
and nearly every other official newspaper.
But the reality may be somewhat different. Past party congresses have
seen moments of high drama — as in Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation
of Joseph Stalin's reign of terror — but their substantive accomplish
ments have in large part consisted of the public unveiling of programs
and decisions worked out in closed meetings during the preceding
months.
Gorbachev, who pledged in October to bring about "transformations
of a truly historic scale — the implementation of a new technological
reconstruction of the economy," has spent the ensuing months rushing
out a game plan to achieve that goal.
The package of proposals, policy positions and personnel changes that
he will place before the 5,000 congress delegates includes a revision of
the 1961 Communist Party program, a sweeping plan for economic and
social development, a near-purge of senior party officials and at least 50
percent of Central Committee members, and an array of foreign policy
initiatives, including a plan for world disarmament.
The programs' overall target date: the year 2000. Their apparent
purposes: to rescue the moribund Soviet economy, restore the Soviet
Union's reputation as the Communist vanguard and, not least, to revive
the country's sagging morale.
Fighting continues in Israel
TEL AVIV, Israel — Katyusha rockets landed yesterday in northern
Israel for the third consecutive day as Israeli troops complete their
withdrawal after a six-day raid into southern Lebanon, an army spokes
man said.
The search for two Israelis, abducted during an ambush in southern
Lebanon last Monday, would continue "by other means," the spokes
man said.
Rabin said in a radio broadcast that the Shia Amal militia had been
the major source of resistance in clashes between Israeli forces and the
local population.
He blamed the militia — which before Monday's Israeli incursion was
regarded as a restraining factor in local clashes with the Israelis — for
the Katyushas, the first to land in northern Galilee for months. The
rockets, which caused no damage, were reportedly fired from near the
south Lebanese coastal town of Tyre. 1
Israeli artillery returned fire on the area, military sources here said.
They said that the Israeli raid involved some 3,000 soldiers, double the
figure earlier reported by U.N. sources. Hundreds of people were ar
rested in raids on some 20 villages, during which several houses were
blown up.
Newspapers in Beirut, meanwhile, dubbed the operation a failure.
The conservative French-language L'Orient le Jour newspaper said that
Israel's achievement during the "fiasco" was to capture large quantities
of arms, including Katyushas.
"But everybody knows how quickly arms and ammunition can be
replaced in Lebanon," L'Orient le Jour said. Hundreds of Shia fun
damentalist Hezbollah militiamen, who are believed to be holding the
Israeli captives, have been deployed in southern villages during the
week, the paper said.
Kuwait willing to fight Iran
TEHRAN, Iran — Kuwait said yesterday that it will not balk at going
to war against Iran.
" If Iran chooses to become our enemy, then we are ready for this. Our
soldiers have strict orders to shoot anybody trying to violate Kuwaiti ter
ritory,' Defence Minister Salem al Sabah said. He was referring to
warnings Friday by Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
that the non-combatant gulf countries would become a "direct party" in
the Iran-Iraq war unless they stopped all aid to Iraq.
China unveils agricultural reform
PEKING — China announced Saturday a scries of new policies aimed
at increasing grain production, including an increase in state investment
for agriculture and the levying of taxes on rural industries to subsidize
farming.
Peasants were promised that they will get special loans to buy fer
tilizers and will be able to sell more of their grain at higher free-market
prices this year.
