# Philippines crisis explodes

### 
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos today declared a state of emer
gency and ordered radio and television stations to
immediately stop broadcasting "propaganda" of
rebel military forces after Manila erupted into
celebrations following an erroneous report that
Marcos and his family had left the country.
As the Philippines political crisis moved into a
climactic stage, rebel forces arrayed against
Marcos, which earlier in the day had claimed to
have succeeded in taking power, later issued an ap
peal for Filipinos to take to the streets around their
stronghold to prevent a government attack.
Opposition leader Corazon Aquino, who was re
ported at an undisclosed location in Manila, also
issued a radio appeal for citizens to go Camp
Crame, held by former defense minister Juan
Ponce Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, the former
acting armed forces chief of staff.
On two occasions in the past 24 hours, govern
ment forces seeking to clear a path toward the rebel
camp were blocked by thousands of anti-Marcos ci
vilian protesters.
The conflicting claims left unclear how much in
fluence each side held over the military and the
government and escalated the state of confusion
that has gripped the country since a military mutiny
began to unfold on Saturday.

Rebel forces holding Camp Crame were
bolstered by the arrival of six air force helicopters
armed with rockets and machine guns and carrying
more defectors. Enrile claimed that the rebels now
have "the helicopter strike group of the air force"
as well as four batallions of troops. A Philippine
batallion normally contains about 700 soldiers.
Rebels in a military helicopter threw a grenade at
the palace, drawing fire from a government tank.
Rebels were also successful in taking over the gov
ernment television station, knocking Marcos off the
air in mid-sentence and, later in the day, inviting
entertainers to the station's headquarters to take
part in the "free" station's programming.
Before the government television station went
off the air, Marcos made his declaration of a state
of emergency during a joint appearance with his
armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Fabian Ver, in
which the two men engaged in an extraordinary ar
gument on national television.
Marcos' public argument with Ver over the use
of heavy weapons and aircraft to attack the rebel
forces came when Ver badgered the president to al
low him to call in air strikes on the camp with two
F-5 aircraft that were circling overhead. Marcos
refused, telling Ver to disperse civilians gathered
outside the camp without shooting them.
"The air force, sir, is ready to mount an air attack

were the civilians to leave the vicinity of Camp
Crame immediately, Mr. President," Ver said im
patiently, while the news conference was in prog
ress. "That's why I come here on your orders so we
can immediately strike them. We have to im
mobilize the helicopters that they got."
Marcos interrupted and said, "My order is not to
attack. No, no, no. Hold on; not to attack."
Ver persisted, "Our negotiations and our prior
dialogue have not succeeded, Mr. President.'
Marcos replied: "All I can say is that we may
have to reach the point we may have to employ
heavy weapons, but you will use the small weapons
in hand or shoulder weapons in the meantime.'
Ver complained, "Our attack forces are being
delayed" and that Marcos had given them orders to
wait. "There are many civilians near our troops,
and we cannot keep on withdrawing. We cannot
withdraw all the time, Mr. President." Marcos
then gave the order to disperse the crowd without
firing on the civilians.
Marcos repeatedly denied in an opening state
ment that the rebel forces had taken over the
country.
He also insisted that "there is no way under
which I can step down or resign from the position
of president. If necessary, I will defend this position
with all the force at my disposal."
