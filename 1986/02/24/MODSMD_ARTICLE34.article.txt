# Reagan warns Marcos of aid cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President
Reagan, in his strongest message yet
to embattled Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos, threatened yes
terday to cut off U.S. military aid if
Marcos uses force against his oppo
nents.
As Marcos vowed to stay in office,
a congressional source said the
United States offered yesterday to
help him leave the island nation in a
U.S. aircraft, and that special envoy
Philip Habib would return to the
Philippines as early as today to "help
arrange a transfer of power." The
source, who has been involved in
U.S.-Philippines diplomatic efforts,
spoke on condition of anonymity.
"A message was communicated to
him to assist him in getting out," the
source said. Pentagon and State De

partment spokesmen declined to
comment on that matter last night.
"We cannot continue our existing
military assistance if the government
uses that aid against other elements
of the Philippine military that enjoy
popular backing," White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said in a
statement issued after Reagan met
with top foreign policy advisers.
Speakes would say only that there
was a "good possibility" of Habib re
turning to the Philippines this week.
Speakes said a decision on a possi
ble U.S. military aid cutoff would
depend on an assessment of the situa
tion there, as rebellious military
leaders demanded Marcos' resigna
tion.
Reagan said late yesterday he had

no plans to talk personally with
Marcos.
Reagan met with Habib and other
advisers in a hastily-called, 90-minute
White House strategy session yester
day, following Habib's return late
Saturday from a week in the
Philippines, where he met with
Marcos and opposition leader
Corazon Aquino.
"An attempt to resolve this situa
tion by force will surely result in
bloodshed and casualties, further
polarize Philippine society and cause
untold damage to the relationship be
tween our governments," Speakes
said.
Across the United States, political
leaders and Filipinos called for
Marcos to step down.
In San Francisco, opponents of the

Marcos regime stormed the
Philippine Consulate, occupying the
office temporarily until San Francisco
police forced them out.
Former President Jimmy Carter,
appearing at a San Francisco fund
raiser, said Marcos should step down
immediately.
In Los Angeles, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson called on Americans to press
for Marcos' resignation.
"Phone the White House. Ask
(President Reagan) to ask Marcos to
step down, and ask him to support
Corazon Aquino as the legitimate
Philippine president," Jackson told a
mostly Filipino audience of 200 at the
Rosewood Methodist Church.
"It will be a thriller in Manila when
Marcos is gone," said Jackson, a 1984
U.S. presidential candidate.
