Eastern considers offer
MIAMI — The leaders of Eastern Airlines,
facing a shutdown threat from creditors and a
strike deadline by pilots, met yesterday to con
sider an offer to purchase the ailing carrier, a un
ion official said.
Meanwhile, the company's management con
tinued to negotiate with representatives of the
pilots and flight attendants in an attempt to ex
tract concessions from the unions.
Eastern's board began meeting last night and
was apparently "working toward a midnight
deadline" from the prospective buyer, reportedly
Houston-based Texas Air Corp., said a member
of the Air Line Pilots Association who refused to
be identified.
The board set an unspecified deadline yester
day to either obtain concessions or accept the
buyout offer, said Eastern spokesman Mark
Vogel.
Eastern, which is $2.5 billion in debt, faces a
Wednesday pilots' strike deadline, a Friday
deadline set by its lenders and a Saturday flight
attendants' strike deadline.
The lenders have threatened to put Eastern in
default and seize its assets if it does not obtain the
labor concessions.
Reagan: Reduce missiles
WASHINGTON — In a formal reply to Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's arms control pro
posal, President Reagan has drafted a sweeping

plan urging elimination of medium range missiles
in Europe as a first step, a U.S. official says.
The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Reagan's proposal was con
tained in a letter signed over the weekend that
would be mailed to Gorbachev at the beginning
of the week. A presidential statement to the na
tion also is planned, he said.
White House spokesman Ben Jarrett con
firmed Saturday that the White House was circu
lating Reagan's plan to U.S. allies, key Congress
members and the U.S. arms negotiating team in
Geneva. He declined to say when the letter
would be sent to Gorbachev or discuss its con
tents.
Reagan's proposal to eliminate medium range
missiles "holds out the hope of earliest progress,"
the other official told the Associated Press.
The official said Reagan also proposed that the
more than 100 mobile SS-20 missiles the Soviets
have deployed in their Asian territories be
reduced to very low numbers. These missiles are
targeted on China and Japan and were not in
cluded in the disarmament proposal Gorbachev
made Jan. 15.
Panel eyes inefficiency
WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed
Services Committee has approved a plan to over
haul the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top
military brass, in an effort to end wasteful inter
service rivalry, according to congressional
sources.
As the panel worked behind closed doors late

last week, a separate White House commission
on military reform was putting the final touches
on another proposal for the Pentagon to spend
money more efficiently.
The two proposals aim to end waste and
duplication in the federal government's largest
branch, and come as the Pentagon is under in
creasing fire over such issues as spending $400 on
hammers and $600 on toilet seat covers.
The matter also won attention after the Octo
ber 1983 invasion of Grenada, when U.S. ground
forces on the tiny Caribbean island could not talk
to each other because their radios did not operate
on the same frequencies.
Domenici knocks plan
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Sen
ate budget committee told the nation's governors
yesterday that the balanced-budget law is "a
planned train wreck," but he voiced optimism
that Congress would act to avoid scheduled, au
tomatic spending cuts.
Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) said the odds
are better than 50-50 that Congress will "pull the
switch and the wreck will be avoided," by passing
its own budget that meets the deficit-reduction
targets of the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget
law.
But Domenici, who offered few details of what
he thought the budget would look like, said a
major increase in taxes for the purpose of reduc
ing the deficit is unlikely, even if included in a
package of overall tax reform.
