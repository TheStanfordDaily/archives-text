Storm aftermath
LINDA — Construction crews working at a
feverish pace completed the tricky job of repair
ing a collapsed levee along the rain-swollen Yuba
River Saturday, allowing thousands of evacuees
to return to what is left of their flood-damaged
homes.
At least one man died in the flood, and author
ities said they expect to find several bodies as
floodwaters recede in the farm communities of
Linda and Olivehurst, about 50 miles north of
Sacramento.
Meanwhile, about 20 miles to the southwest,
400 residents of the farm town of Robbins were
forced to flee as another levee threatened to give
way.
In all, more than 30,000 people have been
forced from their homes since a series of Pacific
storms hit the West Coast on Feb. 12, leaving the
state's system of dams and reservoirs filled
beyond capacity.
Meanwhile, officials warned that the danger
was not yet over in other rain-ravaged areas of
Northern California. Swollen rivers continued to
funnel into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,

keeping water levels at an all-time high and
threatening a number of sparsely populated farm
islands.
Nuclear woes
SACRAMENTO — Design and equipment
weaknesses caused an overcooling accident at the
Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, according to
federal investigators.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff in
vestigation also said the level of training on some
plant systems "was not adequate," but noted the
plant's reactor vessel was never "seriously threat
ened during the rapid cooldown."
The Sacramento Bee, which obtained a copy of
the 99-page report, published details of the in
vestigation in its Sunday editions.
The accident occurred Dec. 26 when the plant
25 miles south of Sacramento experienced a loss
of power to what is called the integrated control
system. That started a process of overcooling
which lasted until power was restored a half-hour
later. During the period, temperatures dropped
180 degrees and a pump ruptured, causing a loss

of radioactive steam, authorities said. There were
no injuries.
The plant has been inoperative since then for
repairs, and is expected to resume operation in
March, pending the NRC's approval.
"The information was available and that could
have prevented this (accident), but in the absence
of adequate plant modifications, the incident
should have been expected," according to the
report, which is scheduled to be presented to the
NRC tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the Unit 2 reactor at Diablo Can
yon atomic power plant near San Luis Obispo
shut down during the weekend because a voltage
regulator failed, a Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
spokesman said yesterday.
"Last night Unit 2 shut down automatically
while operating at 90 percent capacity when a
voltage regulator failed on the main electrical
generator, which is part of the unit's non-nuclear
side," PG&E spokesman Ron Rutkowski said.
Today's weather
Here comes the sun. Again. Highs in the 70s,
lows in the 50s.
