Stanford Applied Physics Prof. Ar
thur Walker left for Washington D.C.
yesterday to resume duties as a mem
ber of the presidential commission in
vestigating the Challenger explosion.
During its first two weeks of work,
the commission has heard charges
that serious errors in engineering,
decision making and management
within the NASA program may have
been responsible for the Jan. 28 fail
ure of the space shuttle Challenger.
The Challenger flight was the 25th
shuttle mission NASA has launched
since the beginning of the shuttle pro
gram. Seven people, including a high
school teacher, were killed in the ex
plosion.
Walker called the explosion a dis
aster, saying, "1 think every one was
quite surprised . . . there have been
accidents before like misplaced tiles
(in the fuselage of a shuttle) but
NASA had 24 successful launches
(before it launched the Challenger)."
Walker, a long-time adviser to
NASA on the shuttle and a former
member of the National Academv ot
Sciences' astronomical research

group, defined the role of the com
mittee as "investigating the accident,
to find out the causes of the accident,
to make recommendations to remedy
these causes and to get the shuttle
back in the air."
The committee is considering alle
gations that faulty seals were used on
the Challenger's fuel tanks and that
NASA officials ignored warnings
from engineers that cold weather at
the time of the launch would
endanger the mission. He stressed,
however, that the commission is not
"a prosecuting committee of any sort.
Our role is not to find blame for the
accident, it is just to find out what
happened."
Walker said he is aware that in
trying to find out what went wrong
with the Jan. 28 launch, the commit
tee might encounter faults of admini
stration and engineering connected
with the Challenger. "If what hap
pened to the shuttle depends on deci
sions that were unwise and impru
dent, then that will be reported to the
president," he said.
The committee begins its hearings
amid turmoil within the NASA ad-
