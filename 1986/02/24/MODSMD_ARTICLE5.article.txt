To celebrate her birthday next

woman.

Colby was horn with two holes
in her heart and primary pulmo
nary hypertension, a heart and
lung defect known as
Eisenmenger's Syndrome. When
she was IS months old, doctors at
the Children's Orthopedic Hospi
tal in Seattle told her parents there
was no hope of recovery for their
daughter.
"They didn't think I'd live past

adolescencc, but next month I'll
be 20," Colby said in an interview
at her home in Pacifica. At this
age, Colby has already outlived
most of her other peers with the
heart-lung syndrome.
Though her body is trapped by
the disease, the soul and spirit of
the happy, deeply religious teen
ager is not. There is not a hint of
despair in her voice as she speaks
matter-of-factly about her dis
ability, the daily threat of death
and the heart-lung transplant that
is her last hope.
In November of 1984, Colby
began the extensive application
and screening process in order to
become a candidate for the heart
lung transplant program here.
Before gaining acceptance to the
transplant waiting list, a potential recipient
undergoes numerous tests to verify that no
other disease exists. It was not until June of
the following year that Colby flew down to
Stanford from her home in Richland, Wash,
for observation.
Colby passed all the tests, but her chest
cavity size and blood type were exactly the
same as another person already on the waiting
list. So Colby was placed on what she called
the "backup, backup" list.
Stanford wants to avoid having two people
feeling they are competing for the same
transplant, Colby said. There are currently 17
people waiting for heart-lung donors at Stan
ford.
In December 1985, Colby was finally ac
cepted to the program and was told that she
and her parents must move to California,
close to the medical center. A transplant can
didate must be within about an hour's drive of
the hospital in order to be ready for the
transplant at that critical unknown moment
when a suitable donor is found. Colby must
carry a pager with her at all times in case she
cannot be reached by telephone.
The three now live in a small home near the
beach, but Colby still misses her desert farm
in Washington. "California is okay . . . it's
nice to visit, but I'd rather be at home," she
said.
Colby was able to attend school using a
battery-powered wheelchair until the 10th
grade, when she finally had to drop out due to
her health. She plans to complete her educa
tion "when" her transplant is performed.
Her life today is shared with an oxygen
tank. She sleeps 11 hours every night wearing
an oxygen mask — sometimes she also must
wear the mask during the day.
Although she realizes her condition is get
ting progressively worse, Colby still lives each
day with remarkable cheerfulness and op
timism. Her days are spent taking pictures
with her 35 mm camera or weaving baskets (a
new hobby of hers). She loves to take trips to
the beach with her dog, Muffet, who was
allowed to come to California with the family.
"She helps a lot ... I would've been a lot
more homesick if I couldn't have brought
her," Colby said.
Like the others in the program, Colby
wakes up every morning full of tremendous
hope. The worst thing about her situation is
the "waiting every day," she said.

"Sometimes I want to say that today would be
a nice day for it to happen, but you can't think
like that."
Dr. James Theodore, associate professor of
respiratory medicine and one of the doctors
involved in the heart-lung translant program,
tries to keep patients like Colby "as physically
stable as possible to maintain their current
level of health which varies with each individ
ual."
Theodore said "the emotional situation is
probably the most crucial to maintain" be
cause of the indefinite wait for a donor. A few
candidates have been waiting as long as three

years, he said.
"It's frustrating because some of them have
been called in three or four times and didn't
end up getting (the transplant)," Colby said.
The donor situation is a complex problem,
according to Theodore. A new set of heart
and lungs for people like Colby must come
from somebody who has just been declared
"brain-dead." This is usually the result of a
car accident or a sudden hemorrhage within
the brain. It is then up to the family of the vic
tim to give up suitable organs for transplanta
tion purposes.
"It's a difficult thing for families to deal

with," Theodore said.
Colby's father, the Rev. Tom Colby,
also empathizes with relatives facing a recent
loss. Still, he urges people to be more willing
to think about donating organs before the
death even occurs, "so then when they end up
in a tragic situation, they'll already have made
up their mind."
In the state of California, even if a person
carries a donor card, specifying that organs be
used for transplants, the family has the right
to annul the wish of the deceased.
A new state law, though, requires that
hospitals routinely approach families of a vic-

Tim and ask them for organ donation. Mar
guerite Brown, the donor coordinator for the
heart and heart-lung transplant programs, is
optimistic about the change in hospitals' atti
tudes due to this law.
"There's been more interest on that subject
than we've ever had before," she said.
The dilemma is still a hard one to solve.
"It's a question of public education over the
long run," Theodore said.
Colby's father agreed with Theodore that
the only way to inform people of the need for
organ donors is through mass education. "If
we don't think about it in advance, and we
aren't prepared, and then we have a loved one
in such a situation . . . when you pull the plug,
you don't just take them, you take someone
else who's waiting," he said.
The first heart-lung transplant at Stanford
took place in 1981. Since then, doctors have
performed 31 transplants on 30 patients —
the last operation was less than two weeks
ago.
Heart-lung surgery is still very risky, ac
cording to Theodore. About 30 percent of the
recipients have died within the first month.
"These people all have tremendous
courage," he said. "We try to select people
into the program who have a strong will to
live . . . and want to return to a normal pat
tern of life."
Colby is aware of this necessity. With a
third of the people in the heart-lung program
waiting three years for a donor, "you have to
have a good will to live and really be optimis
tic, or else you wouldn't make it," she said.
"These are people that are willing to bite
the bullet for a new life," Theodore said.
To help with Colby's expenses, which are
expected to be considerable, a tax-deductible
fund drive has been set up in her hometown.
Surgery costs will exceed $100,000, and the
average cost of flying a donor body to Stan
ford is $5,000, according to Brown.
Friends from a church at home have written
a song about Colby to raise additional money.
The song is called "She's a Brave Young
Girl" and will be recorded by a major Chris
tian artist.
Colby really is a "brave young girl." Never
does she use the word "if' when discussing
her transplant expectation — it's only
"when."
And what is the first thing Colby is going to
do "when" she receives her new set of heart
and lungs?
"Run," she said. In fact, she already has her
jogging suit.
