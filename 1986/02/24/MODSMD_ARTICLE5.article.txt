woman.

Colby was horn with two holes
in her heart and primary pulmo
nary hypertension, a heart and
lung defect known as
Eisenmenger's Syndrome. When
she was IS months old, doctors at
the Children's Orthopedic Hospi
tal in Seattle told her parents there
was no hope of recovery for their
daughter.
"They didn't think I'd live past

adolescencc, but next month I'll
be 20," Colby said in an interview
at her home in Pacifica. At this
age, Colby has already outlived
most of her other peers with the
heart-lung syndrome.
Though her body is trapped by
the disease, the soul and spirit of
the happy, deeply religious teen
ager is not. There is not a hint of
despair in her voice as she speaks
matter-of-factly about her dis
ability, the daily threat of death
and the heart-lung transplant that
is her last hope.
In November of 1984, Colby
began the extensive application
and screening process in order to
become a candidate for the heart
lung transplant program here.
