### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Business, academic and political leaders
speaking at a public service conference here
Saturday reatTirnied the notion that the individ
ual can still make a difference in the world.
The third annual You Can Make a Difference
Conference focused on private initiatives and
public responsibilities, trying "to inspire people
by using people who had made a difference,"
according to senior Marika Fussganger, a mem
ber of the steering committee.
The event was sponsored by the Public Man
agement Program of the Business School, the
Public Service Center, the Law School and the
Medical School. About 150 students were in
volved in organizing the event, Fussganger said.
University President Donald Kennedy
opened the conference, followed b) the keynote
speaker, Frank Newman, president of the Edu
cation Commission of the States.
Kennedy cited a "tension" that exists be
tween individualism and the need for public ser
vice. He also said the Ciramm-Rudman-
Hollings bill presents a new problem as
Americans tr\ to satisfy public needs without
federal attention.
The conference also included a panel discus

sion and small workshops designed to show stu
dents areas in which they can contribute. NBC
News anchorman Tom Brokaw moderated the
panel, which addressed the role of public re
sponsibility in business and politics.
The five-member panel cited several different
approaches to improving the quality of life both
in this country and abroad.
Herman Blake, president of Tougaloo Col
lege, suggested that many problems could be
solved by addressing the "loss of hope" that
characterizes many poverty-stricken communit
ies.
Blake said the central issue is that "people
are becoming superfluous. They have no reason
to strive — no hope."
Blake suggested that Stanford students put
themselves in the situation faced by those less
fortunate. "I'd like to see students living and
working with the problem," he said.
As a result of this experience, students would
gain an "understanding of the objective nature
of this loss of hope." Blake said. Those students
who go on to politics can then "infuse political
decisions with morality." he added.
In addition to this "bridge between lost hope
and political decisions." Blake suggested politi-

cal leaders eliminate the "handout
mentality" in domestic aid.
The "handout mentality" can be
eliminated if leaders will "listen to
(the less fortunate) and provide them
with an opportunity to participate,"
he said.
This idea of increased communica
tion was echoed by David Guyer,
president of Save the Children, a
private charity organization. Guyer,
however, applied the idea to foreign
aid.
The world community has not been
able to make an impact on the devel
oping nations of the world, Guyer
said. One reason for this failure is
that the programs meant to help
Third World countries do not involve
the people being helped, he said.
The programs that work are on a
small scale and promote self-help,
Guyer said. He added that he hopes
the Reagan Administration will read
just its priorities to favor private or
ganizations.
Guyer cited Butan as a country in
which increased communication and
self-help have been successful. The
government of Butan only accepts
help from small private organizations,
refusing aid from groups that plan to
carry out huge projects, he said.
"They only want partnerships,"
Guyer said. .

The panel also suggested that busi
nesses, like charity organizations, en
ter into partnerships with the needy.
"Business must be involved in im
proving the quality of life," said Lena
Guerrero, a member of the Texas
House of Representatives.
Guerrero suggested that business
could be effective at providing day
care facilities for children of working
mothers and filling other needs of so
ciety.
But John Young, president of
Hewlett-Packard Co., said business
"has a very limited ability to help. We
feel the best thing possible is to pro
vide people with jobs."
Young said competitiveness in the
market place is one way to help pay
for expensive social programs of the
future, but said he doubts that the
United States has the ability to pay
for all of its aspirations.
Guerrero, a small business owner
herself, said that her firm, which does
consultant work in advertising for
politicians, does not set aside money
for social programs.
Blake agreed that funds are a limit
ing factor. "There is a vast hiatus be
tween real needs and funds," he said.
The solution, he said, is to sit down
with the needy and explain the situa
tion. "We are not in consultation on
these types of issues."
The media must also play a role in
the advancement of the quality of
human life, Guyer said. He com
mended the media for their coverage

of the recent famine in Africa. The
coverage brought honest dialogue
and enhanced fund-raising efforts, he
said.
But Guyer said he worries about
"sustaining interest in a problem that
will continue for the next 15 years."
Brokaw said this problem is a
"continuing frustration." By defini
tion, news involves presenting the
viewer with what has changed, and al
though the press does update stories,
the follow-up reports seldom have
the same impact as the original ones,
he said.
Dr. Herbert Abrams, co-founder
of the International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War, stressed
that one individual or a small group
can have an impact in combating
problems facing society.
Abrams, a professor of radiology
here, pointed at the success his or
ganization has had in raising under
standing about nuclear war. "I have
faith in the renewal of the individual.
He can have an impact," he said.
Guyer said that he believes people
are becoming more interested in
helping others.
He cited a "more realistic involve
ment" on the part of young people
which he said gives him cause for
hope. "And I think this kind of gath
ering brings that hope alive," Guyer
said.
Fussganger said the event was suc
cessful, citing the fact that 700 people
attended.

As a result of this experience, students would
gain an "understanding of the objective nature

cal leaders eliminate the "handout
mentality" in domestic aid.
The "handout mentality" can be
eliminated if leaders will "listen to
(the less fortunate) and provide them
with an opportunity to participate,"
he said.
This idea of increased communica
tion was echoed by David Guyer,
president of Save the Children, a
private charity organization. Guyer,
however, applied the idea to foreign
aid.
The world community has not been
able to make an impact on the devel
oping nations of the world, Guyer
said. One reason for this failure is
that the programs meant to help
Third World countries do not involve
the people being helped, he said.
The programs that work are on a
small scale and promote self-help,
Guyer said. He added that he hopes
the Reagan Administration will read
just its priorities to favor private or
ganizations.
Guyer cited Butan as a country in
which increased communication and
self-help have been successful. The
government of Butan only accepts
help from small private organizations,
refusing aid from groups that plan to
carry out huge projects, he said.
"They only want partnerships,"
Guyer said. .

The panel also suggested that busi
nesses, like charity organizations, en
ter into partnerships with the needy.
"Business must be involved in im
proving the quality of life," said Lena
Guerrero, a member of the Texas
House of Representatives.
Guerrero suggested that business
could be effective at providing day
care facilities for children of working
mothers and filling other needs of so
ciety.
But John Young, president of
Hewlett-Packard Co., said business
"has a very limited ability to help. We
feel the best thing possible is to pro
vide people with jobs."
Young said competitiveness in the
market place is one way to help pay
for expensive social programs of the
future, but said he doubts that the
United States has the ability to pay
for all of its aspirations.
Guerrero, a small business owner
herself, said that her firm, which does
consultant work in advertising for
politicians, does not set aside money
for social programs.
Blake agreed that funds are a limit
ing factor. "There is a vast hiatus be
tween real needs and funds," he said.
The solution, he said, is to sit down
with the needy and explain the situa
tion. "We are not in consultation on
these types of issues."
The media must also play a role in
the advancement of the quality of
human life, Guyer said. He com
mended the media for their coverage

of the recent famine in Africa. The
coverage brought honest dialogue
and enhanced fund-raising efforts, he
said.
But Guyer said he worries about
"sustaining interest in a problem that
will continue for the next 15 years."
Brokaw said this problem is a
"continuing frustration." By defini
tion, news involves presenting the
viewer with what has changed, and al
though the press does update stories,
the follow-up reports seldom have
the same impact as the original ones,
he said.
Dr. Herbert Abrams, co-founder
of the International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War, stressed
that one individual or a small group
can have an impact in combating
problems facing society.
Abrams, a professor of radiology
here, pointed at the success his or
ganization has had in raising under
standing about nuclear war. "I have
faith in the renewal of the individual.
He can have an impact," he said.
Guyer said that he believes people
are becoming more interested in
helping others.
He cited a "more realistic involve
ment" on the part of young people
which he said gives him cause for
hope. "And I think this kind of gath
ering brings that hope alive," Guyer
said.
Fussganger said the event was suc
cessful, citing the fact that 700 people
attended.
Business, academic and political leaders
speaking at a public service conference here
Saturday reatTirnied the notion that the individ
ual can still make a difference in the world.
The third annual You Can Make a Difference
Conference focused on private initiatives and
public responsibilities, trying "to inspire people
by using people who had made a difference,"
according to senior Marika Fussganger, a mem
ber of the steering committee.
The event was sponsored by the Public Man
agement Program of the Business School, the
Public Service Center, the Law School and the
Medical School. About 150 students were in
volved in organizing the event, Fussganger said.
University President Donald Kennedy
opened the conference, followed b) the keynote
speaker, Frank Newman, president of the Edu
cation Commission of the States.
Kennedy cited a "tension" that exists be
tween individualism and the need for public ser
vice. He also said the Ciramm-Rudman-
Hollings bill presents a new problem as
Americans tr\ to satisfy public needs without
federal attention.
The conference also included a panel discus

sion and small workshops designed to show stu
dents areas in which they can contribute. NBC
News anchorman Tom Brokaw moderated the
panel, which addressed the role of public re
sponsibility in business and politics.
The five-member panel cited several different
approaches to improving the quality of life both
in this country and abroad.
Herman Blake, president of Tougaloo Col
lege, suggested that many problems could be
solved by addressing the "loss of hope" that
characterizes many poverty-stricken communit
ies.
Blake said the central issue is that "people
are becoming superfluous. They have no reason
to strive — no hope."
Blake suggested that Stanford students put
themselves in the situation faced by those less
fortunate. "I'd like to see students living and
working with the problem," he said.
As a result of this experience, students would
