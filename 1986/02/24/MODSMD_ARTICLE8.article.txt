# Speaker says students should develop civil responsibility

### KENNETH FENYO Staff writer 
Students need to "build a sense of common cause and
community," the president of the Education Commission
of the States said here Saturday.
Frank Newman, in the keynote address of the You
Can Make A Difference Conference, said the university
in American culture has departed from its original mission
of developing civic responsibility in students.
In his speech, "The University as a Force of Public Re
sponsibility: Would Jefferson Love Us If He Could See
Us Now?" Newman said that during the early years of the
United States, education was considered the preparation a
citizen must have in order to participate in democracy.
Education now concentrates on the interests of the indi
vidual, he said.
Since World War 11, Newman said, a second American
Revolution, the revolution of individual rights, has taken
place. While he praised the strides made in ensuring equal
opportunity to all races, he said "so much focus on indi
vidual rights has led to traffic-jam democracy."
The interest in the rights of the individual has intensi

fied without the balancing force of obligation, Newman
said, adding that "the restoration of this balance is key."
A new revolution emphasizing service to the commu
nity is necessary, Newman said.
He stressed, however, that balance between public and
private responsibility has to be restored by "increasing a
sense of civic obligation and not by decreasing the sense of
individual rights."
Newman listed five goals students should adopt.
• Aquire multiple skills, such as analytical, organizational
and listening abilities, and not just knowledge.
• Develop skills to work together while retaining personal
commitment. "Balancing the ability to work alone and
with others is at the heart of the democratic experience,"
Newman said.
• Become a risk taker. "To be an effective citizen is to be
an entrepreneur," he said, adding that new approaches to
governing are needed.
• Develop the habit of involvement. These habits would
continue over one s lifetime, Newman said.
• Don't take yourself too seriously. Newman especially
warned that while students should become active citizens,
they "must avoid the image of the grim do-gooder."
