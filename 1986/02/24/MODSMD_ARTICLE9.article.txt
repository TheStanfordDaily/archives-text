The editor of the American Israeli Political Ac
tion Committee s newspaper said yesterday that in
difference and inactivity have threatened Jews and
Israel.
M.J. Rosenthol, the editor of The Near East
Report, told Stanford students at yesterday's
AIPAC conference in Cubberley Auditorium that
they should become politically involved and defend
Israel.
Rosenthol said that if American Jews had been
aware and organized during World War II and the
early days of the state of Israel, they could have
pressured the United States into saving hundreds of

thousands ol uvcs.
"Now we have the hindsight and its benefits and
we can realize the necessity of giving support to Is
rael," he said.
Rosenthol warned against being deceived by
images of Israel as a strong power. "After the 1967
war with Eygpt, Israel's image went, in a very short
period of time, from being that of a weak victim na
tion to being that of super aggressive and strong
power," he said.
"It is well-known that Israel is the fourth-largest
military power in the world. However, no matter
how strong Israel appears to be, she is always on
the margin of survival. Continued U.S. support is
no small part of the reason she exists, but we must
remember that this support is not always

guaranteed."
He called on American Jews to support Israel.
"When we are here we have to do politics. We
have to be involved; we have to argue with
roommates beer ise we care," he said. "What we
get in return is a strong Jewish state, the realization
of a dream that has lived in the hearts of Jews for
2,000 years."
Yesterday's AIPAC conference offered
workshops for Stanford students that included top
ics such as 'How to be an Effective Lobbyist' and
"How to Recognize and Discredit Anti-Israeli
Progaganda."
According to conference co-chair Denise Clark,
the conference was designed to to teach students
who want to channel their efforts to help Israel.
