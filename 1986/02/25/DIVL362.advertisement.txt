MicroTex Available Through
Stanford Site License
Academic Computing and Information Systems has negotiated a site license with
Addison-Wesley that makes MicroTeX, a microcomputer typesetting program,
available to the Stanford community. Written by David Fuchs, MicroTeX is an
implementation of the TeX typesetting system that can be used on an IBM XT, AT, or
PC with a hard disk. It is used to format documents (articles, papers, books) and is
most useful for text that includes complicated mathematical formulas or that
requires professional formatting.
MicroTeX is available through the Stanford Bookstore to Stanford faculty, students,
and staff working half-time or more. There is a charge of $8.00 (to cover the cost of
the diskettes); you must provide proof of your Stanford affiliation and sign a waiver
form in which you agree not to distribute MicroTeX further.
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF SHOULD CONTACT
DEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS (DIS) at 723-3145.
For more information, faculty, students, and academic staff should contact
Instruction and Research Information Systems (IRIS) at 723-1055.

This Spring the ASSU Boathouse will be offering all kinds of fun to
the Stanford community. We have great facilities, but Stanford
students are usually the only people in greater Santa Clara
county that don't take advantage of them. This year, we hope that
will change, so we're getting out the word early on what's going
on at Lake Lag.
1) Water. The lake is full of fresh rain water and will be ready for swimming by the
first day of Spring quarter. Show off those beer bellys and freshmen 10s on the
bitchinest beach in Northern California. Hours are 9-6 everyday.
2) Windsurfer storage. Why let your board rot at home or bother your roommate?
Bring it to Lake Lag and enjoy using it all Spring long. We have storage spaces
available for 35 boards and the storage fee is only $25. Call 497-3735 to reserve
a spot.
3) Canoe Rentals. Tour scenic Lake Lag and impress friends with your stroke
techniques. All for $1 an hour, everyday.
4) Parties. If everybody votes "yes" for the party area special fee request on this
year's Spring ballot the Boathouse will be offering a brand new lakeside party
place equipped with BBQ, lights, power hookups and available every night to
any and all student groups. Call Andy (after April Ist, 1986) at 497-3735 to
reserve a time.
5) Be a Lifeguard. Save babies, bag rays, and get paid $6 an hour. Any student
who has an advanced lifesaving certificate is eligible.
Organizational Meeting
Thursday, February 27th, noon at the Boathouse.
Questions â€” call Dave at 497-3735.
