# Vietnam memorial
## Wall to be shown 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
As it slowly winds its way across the
country, stopping in towns like Tyler,
Tex., and Ventura, the outpouring of
emotion continues to grow. Many cry
and leave flowers at each location
that temporarily serves as its home.
Stanford students and members of
the surrounding community will have
the opportunity to feel that emotion
when the "Moving Wall," a half-scale
replica of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington, D.C.,
comes to the University on March 2
for eight days.
I he wall, bearing the names of
some 58,022 U.S. military personnel
who were either killed or listed as
missing in action in the Vietnam War,
will rest on Wilbur Field between
Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The effort to bring the black
plexiglass and wood memorial,
measuring 250 feet in length and ap
proximately six feet in height, is being
spearheaded by residents of Branner
Hall.
"You are somehow able to bring
something to the public and really
deeply affect them with something as
simple as a list of names," said David
Hoffman, a Branner resident assistant
(R A).
It was Hoffman, along with Bran
ner Resident Fellow Kennell Jackson,
who first proposed bringing the wall
to Stanford after he read an article
about it in The New York Times hist
December.
Since that time, Hoffman said he
has put approximately 12 hours of
work each week into the project.
Plans to bring the wall to the Univer
sity were ironed out with one of its
three creators, John Devitt, a Viet
nam veteran from San Jose, over
winter vacation.
Hoffman and Beth Kneeland, a
Branner RA, are now securing funds
for the project, which will cost ap
proximately $3,000, Hoffman said.
In addition to money already
granted by Branner and Residential
Education, Hoffman is soliciting
funds from various University de
partments, graduate schools and
freshman dormitories.
But Hoffman's concerns with the
wall extend far beyond financial de
tails.
"Most of the people that died in
Vietnam were our age, and yet we
have so little understanding of the
impact that it had on American soci
ety," Hoffman said.
"By bringing the wall to Stanford
we hope to make the war as real as it
was to the people who fought in it and
were part of it."he said.
Jackson said that the wall is "em
phatically the people's wall." noting
that Devitt's creation allows those
unable to see the permanent memo
rial in Washington, DC., the oppor
tunity to feel its impact.
While Hoffman believes that the
wall makes a powerful statement by
itself, he said that there will be a spe
cial effort to personalize the experi
ence for visitors.
"We want to have a book that
people can sign and write comments
in," he said, adding that it is almost
impossible to predict how many stu
dents and community residents will
visit the memorial.

In a letter sent to Hoffman, Devitt
stated that he has "found that it (the
wall) is much more effective if it
stands on its own, not in conjunction
with any other activity. Just by itself,
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, in
its subtle unassuming way, makes the
loudest statement I have ever heard."
Hoffman said he believes that
Stanford is the first major university
to host the wall.
