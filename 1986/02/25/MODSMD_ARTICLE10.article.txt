Cyclists should
follow the rules
I am disturbed by the riding
techniques advocated by Allen C.
Estes in his column ("Let bicycle
anarchists reign," The Daily, Feb.
19). I follow much of the same route
on my bicycle to and from campus,
and would like to list several reasons
why obeying the rules is in our best
interest.
• To be seen — By riding on the
right side of the road, drivers will
know where to look. This is especially
critical as drivers check to the left
before making a right turn.
• To earn respect — Bicycles are
vehicles and should be accorded all of
the rights of the road, but with those
privileges come the responsibilities of
obeying the rules. We need to culti
vate a visible presence as legitimate
road users.
• To develop goodwill — Like it or
not, we depend on motorists watching
out for us and giving us room. Don't
irritate those drivers by flaunting a
disregard for the rules.
Bicycling is still great transporta
tion and recreation. Take a few extra
seconds at the next red light, and ar
rive safely.

No Man is an
Island
The recent You Can Make a Dif
ference Conference should have been

attended by all faculty and students.
The theme of the day, introduced by
speaker Frank Newman, president of
the Education Commission of the
States, centered on the foundation of
higher education: preparation for
civic responsibility.
Saying it is "difficult to stay awake
on a full stomach," Newman
mourned our country's stagnation. Al
though he emphasized industry in this
case, it is also quite easy to see this
passivity in the activities of students.
The slothfulness of "absorbing"
knowledge in classrooms, au
ditoriums and libraries has spread to
the extracurricular world of the Uni
versity. Organizations, plays, musi
cals, panels, forums, speeches ... all
seem to suffer from under
attendance.
Some of us call this "apathy." Our
elders often label it "deification of the
self." However it is not all the fault of
the students. Our "higher education,"
initially meant to prepare us for active
participation in society and the demo
cratic process, places few demands on
us besides academic success. Respon
sibility is not enforced nor is it em
phaized at most colleges. Likewise,
conviction, assertiveness, vitality and
commitment have also been de
throned from their Jeffersonian be
ginnings.
Titled "No Man is an Island,"
Saturday's conference renewed with
conviction the duty we have to our
selves to be honestly committed to
the ideals and responsibilities we up
hold. Only if students go beyond their
academic studies to establish their
values and opinions on issues of na
tional and international importance

will the University be upholding a
principle it has long ignored. As indi
viduals with our very own value sys
tems the above responsibility begins
with us.

Profs rejection
was unwarranted
As a freshman who is currently
taking a course on Polish-Lithuanian
history from Prof. Davies, I was
shocked and horrified to find out that
his candidacy for a professorship was
rejected (Daily, Feb. 14). Because I
am a newcomer to Stanford and
academia in general, I was unaware
that such a knowledgeable man and
excellent professor could possibly be
rejected after a unanimous recom
mendation by a search committee.
Davies has an amazing mastery of
his subject, is a fascinating lecturer,
possesses an amusing sense of humor,
and is an excellent writer.
I am unaware if it is possible to re
consider such decisions concerning
professorships. As a student who
plans to continue taking courses from
the History Department for at least
three more years, I certainly hope
that the committee that rejected
Davies' candidacy can reconsider and
does offer Davies the chair in East
Slavic studies. It will be a great loss to
Stanford as a whole if Davies is not
asked to stay and teach.
