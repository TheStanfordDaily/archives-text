## Anti-drug efforts don't address causes 
### 
Three billion dollars. That's how much the fed
eral government spent on drug enforcement last
year. The Reagan Administration has vowed to
virtually eliminate the flow of illegal drugs into this
country and an unprecedented effort is being made
toward this goal.
Yet are we truly winning the war on drugs? Are
these efforts paying off.' If you ask individuals in
the government, they will say yes. They will cite
such examples as a 1984 Hong Kong heroin bust in
which huge quantities of heroin were intercepted,
supposedly constricting the world supply severely.
Yet the more we try to stop the flow of illegal
drugs, the more we realize how out-of-control the
situation is.

JAY ZACHAR

In 1983. police found at least 2.000 tons of
marijuana (some sources put the figure closer to
10.000) on a single farm in Mexico. Up to that
point, it had been thought that there was not that
much pot in all of Mexico.
The number of countries involved in drug pro
duction is high and drug enforcement in these
countries is often difficult. In such countries as
Burma, where the government doesn't control drug
production, it is very hard, and in such countries as
Brazil, which is covered by one million square miles
of jungle, it is impossible.
What's more, it seems as if drug smugglers know
every trick in the book. Practically every measure
and countermeasure invented by drug enforcement
agencies has been circumvented in one way or
another. When U.S. customs agents began to use
dogs to sniff for certain types of illegal drugs.

smugglers soon learned that they could get their
drugs past by using shrink wrapping. Similarly,
when a coastal network of radar stations was set up
to detect incoming planes, pilots smuggling drugs
found they could evade detection by flying above
and behind a regular commercial airliner.
By practically all accounts, the supply of most
major drugs has increased dramatically: it seems as
if President Reagan's drug-control programs are
doomed to fail. Take cocaine, for example. The
street price of cocaine has fallen 75 percent in the
last five years. At the same time, the quality of the
drug has improved greatly. This can mean only one
thing: Supply is up.
It is becoming more and more clear that the drug
situation is a tenacious hydra, a complex and
multi-faceted problem that isn't getting any smal
ler. But what, if anything, can be done to stem the
flow of illegal drugs?
Empirically, moral crusades have failed. Prohib
ition is a prime example. This constitutional
amendment did little to dampen people's desire for
alcohol, and at the same time it spawned a whole
new wave of crime and violence. During the '50s,
sexual attitudes were extremely repressive (teenage
sex was considered practically a felony). During
this time, many young women lost their lives in
back-alley abortions because they felt they had no
other options available to them.
People take drugs because they want to take
drugs. They have a need to do so. The U.S judicial
system is just now recognizing that the drug pro
blem is a medical one. not a legal one.
When a person's environment does not allow one
to be his or her "self." he/she becomes neurotic.
The nervous system becomes jammed, in a sense,
and tension sets in. To cope with this tension, a per

son might resort to drugs. Such drugs as marijuana
loosen up this tension and allow it to be expressed
in such things as abstract thought and daydreaming.
Other drugs, such as heroin, simply numb this ten
sion.
If we want to curb the consumption of illegal
drugs, we need to address the cause of the problem,
not the symptoms. The symptoms are drugs flowing
into this country from practically every corner of
the globe. The cause of this problem is the fact that
a lot of people don't have their basic needs met.
They haven't been permitted to be themselves and
they don't feel good about being themselves.
If we want to deal with our drug problem, we
need to have a society which caters more to the
needs of the human organism. This would probably
entail major reforms in many of our institutions, in
cluding our places of work, our schools and our
families. This may seem like a somewhat vague
proposition, but it could be best understood if it
were put into practice. Our schools, for example,
could be geared more toward allowing people to
develop their own innate abilities rather than trying
to force them to fit some generic mold. Our families
could be less concerned with "disciplining" and
"directing" and more concerned with respecting
one's need to be free and allowed to do what one
wants.
In short, our drug problem has some very deep
and broad roots. It is an expression of our very own
nature. I believe that when society progresses and
we become more and more aware of our own selves
and how these selves have to be respected and
nurtured, we will see a downturn in the use of
drugs, and this problem, perhaps along with many
others, will finally be resolved.

thing: Supply is up.
It is becoming more and more clear that the drug
situation is a tenacious hydra, a complex and
multi-faceted problem that isn't getting any smal
ler. But what, if anything, can be done to stem the
flow of illegal drugs?
Empirically, moral crusades have failed. Prohib
ition is a prime example. This constitutional
amendment did little to dampen people's desire for
alcohol, and at the same time it spawned a whole
new wave of crime and violence. During the '50s,
sexual attitudes were extremely repressive (teenage
sex was considered practically a felony). During
this time, many young women lost their lives in
back-alley abortions because they felt they had no
other options available to them.
People take drugs because they want to take
drugs. They have a need to do so. The U.S judicial
system is just now recognizing that the drug pro
blem is a medical one. not a legal one.
When a person's environment does not allow one
to be his or her "self." he/she becomes neurotic.
The nervous system becomes jammed, in a sense,
and tension sets in. To cope with this tension, a per

son might resort to drugs. Such drugs as marijuana
loosen up this tension and allow it to be expressed
in such things as abstract thought and daydreaming.
Other drugs, such as heroin, simply numb this ten
sion.
If we want to curb the consumption of illegal
drugs, we need to address the cause of the problem,
not the symptoms. The symptoms are drugs flowing
into this country from practically every corner of
the globe. The cause of this problem is the fact that
a lot of people don't have their basic needs met.
They haven't been permitted to be themselves and
they don't feel good about being themselves.
If we want to deal with our drug problem, we
need to have a society which caters more to the
needs of the human organism. This would probably
entail major reforms in many of our institutions, in
cluding our places of work, our schools and our
families. This may seem like a somewhat vague
proposition, but it could be best understood if it
were put into practice. Our schools, for example,
could be geared more toward allowing people to
develop their own innate abilities rather than trying
to force them to fit some generic mold. Our families
could be less concerned with "disciplining" and
"directing" and more concerned with respecting
one's need to be free and allowed to do what one
wants.
In short, our drug problem has some very deep
and broad roots. It is an expression of our very own
nature. I believe that when society progresses and
we become more and more aware of our own selves
and how these selves have to be respected and
nurtured, we will see a downturn in the use of
drugs, and this problem, perhaps along with many
others, will finally be resolved.

Three billion dollars. That's how much the fed
eral government spent on drug enforcement last
year. The Reagan Administration has vowed to
virtually eliminate the flow of illegal drugs into this
country and an unprecedented effort is being made
toward this goal.
Yet are we truly winning the war on drugs? Are
these efforts paying off.' If you ask individuals in
the government, they will say yes. They will cite
such examples as a 1984 Hong Kong heroin bust in
which huge quantities of heroin were intercepted,
supposedly constricting the world supply severely.
Yet the more we try to stop the flow of illegal
drugs, the more we realize how out-of-control the
situation is.

JAY ZACHAR

In 1983. police found at least 2.000 tons of
marijuana (some sources put the figure closer to
10.000) on a single farm in Mexico. Up to that
point, it had been thought that there was not that
much pot in all of Mexico.
The number of countries involved in drug pro
duction is high and drug enforcement in these
countries is often difficult. In such countries as
Burma, where the government doesn't control drug
production, it is very hard, and in such countries as
Brazil, which is covered by one million square miles
of jungle, it is impossible.
What's more, it seems as if drug smugglers know
every trick in the book. Practically every measure
and countermeasure invented by drug enforcement
agencies has been circumvented in one way or
another. When U.S. customs agents began to use
dogs to sniff for certain types of illegal drugs.

smugglers soon learned that they could get their
drugs past by using shrink wrapping. Similarly,
when a coastal network of radar stations was set up
to detect incoming planes, pilots smuggling drugs
found they could evade detection by flying above
and behind a regular commercial airliner.
By practically all accounts, the supply of most
major drugs has increased dramatically: it seems as
if President Reagan's drug-control programs are
doomed to fail. Take cocaine, for example. The
street price of cocaine has fallen 75 percent in the
last five years. At the same time, the quality of the
drug has improved greatly. This can mean only one
thing: Supply is up.
