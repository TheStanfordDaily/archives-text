# Beware blind faith in science

### 
Last fall the Pentagon, in response to perceived U.S.
disloyalty, proposed cutting down on spying and dis
loyalty by massively expanding the use of the lie detector.
In our culture, which has come to quantify and categorize
everything, to search for truth by objective means, even
this was a new step. Every government employee was to
be tested. If it weren't for the strenuous objections of Sec
retary of State George Shultz, the issue might have passed
quietly into the night. But it didn't, and it should not. The
lie detector is a monument to subjective determination
shrouded in scientific objectivity. It is really more of a
sweat detector than anything else. Instead of divining
truth, it measures anxiety. But the most interesting facet
of the whole incident was the Pentagon's answer to the

problem of disloyalty. They turned immediately to sci
ence, to an objective account of truth and falsity. In an age
of scientific miracles, we look to science to penetrate
every problem and find its solution. Why not, as in this
case, to find the basis of truth?
Human beings have always attempted to explain the
numerous quandaries in which we find ourselves. The
mantle of truth used to belong to religion. But that has
changed. The task of explaining the world has now been
given to science. Science undoubtedly has much to offer
the world in terms of medical, technological and physical
progress. But can we ask, or expect, science to solve our
moral problems, to distinguish between right and wrong,
truth and lies, good and evil?
We find in the news recently that pro-life, anti-abortion
advocates have found "scientific proof' that human life
begins at conception. The anti-abortion forces are at
tempting to outlaw abortion based on such "scientific"
evidence. A moral and political issue is subsumed by the
irrefutable answer of science. Abortion would be murder,
and that's that. We are becoming a society which doesn't
want to deal with the difficult moral, political and societal
questions with which we are constantly affronted, but in
stead gives them to science, the "final answer," to deter
mine. In a world filled with uncertainty, mankind desper
ately desires to have a fix on something, to find out truths
to which it can hold tightly. So along comes science, which
can tell us what exactly is truth, and lies, and life and
death. We have not yet, as a society, come to an ultimate
belief in the laws of science. The lie detector is still ques
tioned; Jesse Helms and his buddies have not realized
their goal of outlawing abortion. Yet the trend toward the
ultimate belief in the power and righteousness of science
continues and is changing our society in drastic ways.
The trend can be seen in numerous examples.
President Reagan proposes to do away with the paradoxes
and contradictions of nuclear deterrence with a program
that "would make nuclear weapons impotent and obso
lete." Instead of dealing with arms control through

negotiation, we attempt to let science solve our problems,
creating the absolute weapon that will make all previous
scientific solutions unimportant. We don't want to deal
with the moral and political aspects of arms control; in
stead, we look to science to give us an answer that will
mean we won't have to confront all the other questions. In
answering nuclear weapons, espionage and abortion with
scientific answers we have not done away with moral
quandaries, we have only put them in a place behind sci
ence where they are much harder to see.
The scientific search for truth can also be seen in
analyzing human reactions to literature and art, as well as
in the understanding and contemplation of genius. We are
taught to analyze why we are affected by certain images,
situations and emotions, looking at them rationally. What
is invalid is that very personal, emotional response which
comes from inside and surfaces for no apparent reason.
Similarly, the power of rationality and science is seen in
the search for genius. Albert Einstein's brain was
looked at by scientists intent on finding the source ofhis
genius in the cells of his brain. They felt that the greatness
of Einstein was due not to a special soul in the man, a spe
cial ability to understand, but to the physical, neuronal
structures that composed his brain. We cannot become so
fixated on objective truths and rational answers that the
soul of a man is subjugated to a mechanistic, reductionist
path to truth. The idea of trying to understand the human
mind by picking it apart is like looking at a house to de
termine what types of lives are led inside. Surely, some
things can be seen, but the house is just a house; what is
important is what is inside.
How the growth of technology has spurred our society
to insanely hectic growth and consumption of nature is an
apt metaphor for the consuming nature of science. As our
belief in science has grown, it has eaten up many old, valid
beliefs. The fact that placebos were acknowledged only
after they were proven "scientifically" valid is a case in
point. No one gave power to what other cultures, other
people, had always known; The psychology of a patient is
vitally important. Technology and science are eating up
nature, they can't live in harmony, for science, at this
point, can't live with paradox, with the unanswerable, with
anything that defies categorization. We must hope that we
realize that with subjective choices there are not always
objective answers. Humanity seeks to ground itself, to
construct a world with some rational, guiding forces, but
these necessary ideas must not be substituted for truth.
Science does have important knowledge about the human
condition, but it must know and stay within its boundaries.
Of human personality, morals and emotions science
can say something, but that something is very limited.
There is another world in which the human being dwells
besides the physical, material one, and to try and draw
straight, direct lines between the two is reductionist and
devastating. In our society, which is increasingly run by
technology and guided by science, we cannot lose our own
ability to decide issues, or try and escape our quandaries
by letting science determine right and wrong, truth and lie,
murder and non-murder. Humanity must understand
where science is beneficial and where it is not. If we don't,
the scientist will become God, and humanity the slaves of
science. The destruction will be spectacular.
