## I yam what I think I yam 
### CHRIS MYERS Staff writer 
The sun shone majestically on
her glistening hair, and her deep
green eyes glimmered like
emeralds. Her soft lips curled into a
demure smile as she tilted her head
back to look up at the azure sky
above us. It seemed as if a bit of
heaven had been transplanted to
this secluded spot, just for the two
of us.
As I reached out for her hand, I
knew, more than I had ever known
before, that there was nowhere in
the world I would rather be than
here, with my beloved, in the mid
dle of this deserted but sun-blessed
field of sweet potatoes.
My adored one must surely have
been able to read my mind, for just
then I was shaken out of my blissful
reverie by the sweet but slightly
whiny and occasionally bothersome
sound of her voice:
"No, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but
I'm afraid that these are yams."
Dear Bug Me, What is the difference
between yams and sweet potatoes?
-Anonymous
This strikes me as the kind of
question that is really at the heart of
Bug Me. You know what I mean —
the kind of question that has abso
lutely no social (or other) signifi
cance and could be answered by
anyone, but appears in this column,
anyway, precisely because it has ab
solutely no social significance and is
so easily answered, and because it
provides such perfect fodder for
deeply meaningful introductory
paragraphs like this one.
This also strikes me as the kind of
question that everybody used to do
reports about in grade school — at
least I did. Of course, those were
the days before research papers be
came a major typewritten multi
page footnoted pains in the butt,
when the only source anybody ever
needed for anything was the good
old World Book Encyclopedia.
Well, just for old times' sake, I

decided to consult the trusty Wcrld
Book for this question, and write
the answer in grade-school style.
However, 1 discovered that
there's not a World Book to be
found on the Stanford campus.
In desperation, I journeyed to
Palo Alto High School. This was
quite an adventure. First I had to
storm the gauntlet of lustful Paly
women blocking my path. . . .
Just kidding. Actually, 1 just got
lost immediately and had to ask
some guy with spiked purple hair to
point me to the library. When I got
there I was overjoyed to find not
one, but two, sets of the World
Book Encyclopedia. I chose the
1980 edition (that's the year I
graduated from grade school), and

here are the results of my research:
Both are potato-like vegetables
with thick roots, and each is com
monly confused with the other.
Yams are generally juicier and
lighter in color than sweet potatoes.
The color of the inside of a yam is
usually yellow or closer to white,
while sweet potatoes are more
likely to be darker yellow or closer
to orange. Yams belong to the yam
family of vegetables, whereas sweet
potatoes belong to the morning
glory family of plants. Almost all
yams are grown in tropical regions,
especially in western Africa. Hardly
any yams are grown in the United
States, because the weather is too
cold. Sweet potatoes, on the other
hand, are grown extensively in the
southern United States. Some of

the juicier varieties of sweet
potatoes are called yams in the Un
itedJStates, which accounts for a lot
of the confusion between the two.
My mommy says sweet potatoes are
better. *•
Dear Bug Me, For the last two years
I have been noticing a 10-speed
bicycle withstand the tortures of
time, and the ravages of scavengers,
while apparently being abandoned
next to the tennis conns across from
Encina Gym. In my opinion, the
scenery would be much better with
out this monument. Is there any way
it can be removed?
-Rusty Locke
And all this time I thought Locke
was just some boring guy in West
ern Culture.
If I could have found this bike, it
would be gone even as I type. How
ever, 1 rode around by Encina and
couldn't find any bike by this de
scription. But maybe 1 wasn't
looking in the right place. Anyway,
here's what I found out:
1 first called the Stanford Police. I
talked to Capt. Marvin Moore,
who said that they pick up aban
doned bikes. However, they won't
pick up a bike that's locked or
chained, regardless of how long it
has been there, because they don't
consider a locked bike abandoned.
Moore said that he had heard of
people locking their bikes up for
periods of a year or more, and then
returning to get them.
"A lot of people have some
strange habits," explained Moore.
"We don't get in the business of
cutting locks. If a bike is secured,
it's not abandoned."
But Moore also mentioned a
University program for cutting
locks and collecting bikes left
around campus over the summer.
This program is run out of the Re
sident Manager's Office. It turns
out that they only pick up bikes left
around residence halls, so the bike
in question really wouldn't be eligi
ble.
Anybody want to buy a bike?

This program is run out of the Re
sident Manager's Office. It turns
out that they only pick up bikes left
around residence halls, so the bike
in question really wouldn't be eligi
ble.
Anybody want to buy a bike?


BUG
ME
The sun shone majestically on
her glistening hair, and her deep
green eyes glimmered like
emeralds. Her soft lips curled into a
demure smile as she tilted her head
back to look up at the azure sky
above us. It seemed as if a bit of
heaven had been transplanted to
this secluded spot, just for the two
of us.
As I reached out for her hand, I
knew, more than I had ever known
before, that there was nowhere in
the world I would rather be than
here, with my beloved, in the mid
dle of this deserted but sun-blessed
field of sweet potatoes.
My adored one must surely have
been able to read my mind, for just
then I was shaken out of my blissful
reverie by the sweet but slightly
whiny and occasionally bothersome
sound of her voice:
"No, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but
I'm afraid that these are yams."
Dear Bug Me, What is the difference
between yams and sweet potatoes?

This strikes me as the kind of
question that is really at the heart of
Bug Me. You know what I mean —
the kind of question that has abso
lutely no social (or other) signifi
cance and could be answered by
anyone, but appears in this column,
anyway, precisely because it has ab
solutely no social significance and is
so easily answered, and because it
provides such perfect fodder for
deeply meaningful introductory
paragraphs like this one.
This also strikes me as the kind of
question that everybody used to do
reports about in grade school — at
least I did. Of course, those were
the days before research papers be
came a major typewritten multi
page footnoted pains in the butt,
when the only source anybody ever
needed for anything was the good
old World Book Encyclopedia.
Well, just for old times' sake, I

decided to consult the trusty Wcrld
Book for this question, and write
the answer in grade-school style.
However, 1 discovered that
there's not a World Book to be
found on the Stanford campus.
In desperation, I journeyed to
Palo Alto High School. This was
quite an adventure. First I had to
storm the gauntlet of lustful Paly
women blocking my path. . . .
Just kidding. Actually, 1 just got
lost immediately and had to ask
some guy with spiked purple hair to
point me to the library. When I got
there I was overjoyed to find not
one, but two, sets of the World
Book Encyclopedia. I chose the
1980 edition (that's the year I
graduated from grade school), and

here are the results of my research:
Both are potato-like vegetables
with thick roots, and each is com
monly confused with the other.
Yams are generally juicier and
lighter in color than sweet potatoes.
The color of the inside of a yam is
usually yellow or closer to white,
while sweet potatoes are more
likely to be darker yellow or closer
to orange. Yams belong to the yam
family of vegetables, whereas sweet
potatoes belong to the morning
glory family of plants. Almost all
yams are grown in tropical regions,
especially in western Africa. Hardly
any yams are grown in the United
States, because the weather is too
cold. Sweet potatoes, on the other
hand, are grown extensively in the
southern United States. Some of

the juicier varieties of sweet
potatoes are called yams in the Un
itedJStates, which accounts for a lot
of the confusion between the two.
My mommy says sweet potatoes are
better. *•
Dear Bug Me, For the last two years
I have been noticing a 10-speed
bicycle withstand the tortures of
time, and the ravages of scavengers,
while apparently being abandoned
next to the tennis conns across from
Encina Gym. In my opinion, the
scenery would be much better with
out this monument. Is there any way
it can be removed?

And all this time I thought Locke
was just some boring guy in West
ern Culture.
If I could have found this bike, it
would be gone even as I type. How
ever, 1 rode around by Encina and
couldn't find any bike by this de
scription. But maybe 1 wasn't
looking in the right place. Anyway,
here's what I found out:
1 first called the Stanford Police. I
talked to Capt. Marvin Moore,
who said that they pick up aban
doned bikes. However, they won't
pick up a bike that's locked or
chained, regardless of how long it
has been there, because they don't
consider a locked bike abandoned.
Moore said that he had heard of
people locking their bikes up for
periods of a year or more, and then
returning to get them.
"A lot of people have some
strange habits," explained Moore.
"We don't get in the business of
cutting locks. If a bike is secured,
it's not abandoned."
But Moore also mentioned a
University program for cutting
locks and collecting bikes left
around campus over the summer.
This program is run out of the Re
sident Manager's Office. It turns
