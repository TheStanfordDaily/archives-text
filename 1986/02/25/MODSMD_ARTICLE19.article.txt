## '9Â½' falls short 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
Someone with a sardonic sense
of humor in the MGM publicity
department is calling "916
Weeks" a "love story for the
'80s." Let's hope the publicist is
kidding. "916 Weeks" is a film
about a perverse relationship cen
tered around the need for instant
gratification. Is this decade really
so bad that it deserves this kind of
beautifully photographed but
soulless movie?
Based on an autobiographical
novel by Elizabeth McNeill (a
psuedonym), "9 x /i Weeks" tells
the story of Elizabeth, an attrac
tive young divorcee who works in
a New York art gallery. One day
she meets John (Mickey Rourke),
a wealthy and mysterious wheeler
dealer in the financial industry.
They begin a relationship which
quickly becomes kinky and ob
sessive, as John begins to domi
nate and humiliate Elizabeth in
every way possible. She
overcomes her shame and dis
covers that she likes this kind of
treatment. She loses interest in
nearly every aspect of her life,
even her job, as her affair with
John threatens to overwhelm her.
The viewer, however, may be
underwhelmed by John and
Elizabeth's story. The movie
opens promisingly enough, but
halfway through the plot runs out,
so instead of a narrative we get
scene after scene of kinky sex.
There is a certain lewd fun to be
had in watching all this, and in
wondering how good actors like
Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger
were ever drawn to this material.
But ultimately "9'/i Weeks" is a
slow, boring movie, ending not
with a bang but with a very drawn
out whimper.

At first it's believable that
Elizabeth would fall in love with
John. He is a charming cipher;
even his attempts at seduction are
laced with self-mockery. Elizabeth
sees something of herself in him,
and so, to quote the Bryan Ferry
song which adorns the film's
soundtrack, she's a slave to love.
Elizabeth finds her own sexual
nature becoming recklessly ex
travagant, as in one rather inter
esting scene in which she's aroused
by the artwork at the gallery
where she works.
Actress Basinger could qualify
as a work of art herself. With her
natural careworn beauty, it's
understandable why John would
regard her as the perfect object of
desire. In the film "Fool For
Love," Basinger showed that she
could handle difficult material,
and it's a testament to her ability
that she doesn't look utterly
foolish by the end of "9 l /i
Weeks." Working against a thin
script, she makes Elizabeth a
likeable, if not exactly compelling,
character.
Rourke survives "9'/i Weeks"
too, though not as ably, since the
script requires him to play the
smirking sexual predator all the
way through. John is a one
dimensional character, but
Rourke manages to bring some
warmth and humor to the part.
Perhaps if he'd had a director
who was actually interested in
characters, Rourke might have
been more successful. As it is,
director Adrian Lyne of
"Flashdance" fame is more con
cerned with his beautiful blue-gray
lighting than with the nuances of
character development. Yet "9 x /i
Weeks" is a great-looking movie,
every frame resembling a page out
of the Italian edition of Vogue
magazine.
