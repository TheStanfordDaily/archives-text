# Art crosses cultures in spiritual display
## 
### KEN CHAVEZ 
The art works in three exhibits cur
rently on display at the Palo Alto
Cultural Center (1313 Newell Rd.)
are a visual representation of their
unifying theme, "Spirit and Culture."
To open two of the three exhibits,
"Rituals: A Cross-Cultural View"
and "Visible/Invisible" last Sunday,
the Cultural Center hosted an artists'
reception which attracted about 100
Bay Area art patrons.
The third exhibit, "A Year in
Oaxaca: Works by Peter Jodaitis."
has been showing at the center since
Jan. 19.
Dyana Chadwick, the curator of
the exhibits, said of "Rituals" that
she "mainly tried to convey the con
cept of the artist as shaman, the
(native American) magic maker, who
makes the magic visible."
The exhibit, located in the center's
West Gallery, is a collage of two and
three-dimensional works by seven ar
tists that portrays the ritual activities
of primitive cultures.
"Gypsy Mysteries," one of the
dominant pieces of the "Rituals" ex
hibit, is a recent creation of Chicana
artist Amalia Mesa-Bains.
"It's the most cross-cultural piece
I've ever done," Mesa-Bains said of
her three-dimensional altar, which in
corporates Hindu mythology into the
traditionally Mexican art form of al
tar decoration.
The work consists of a hot pink al
tar set before a 10-foot, fluorescent
orange orb representing the sun.
Gold and silver flames and hand
prints, spray-painted through stencil,
splash the altar and its backdrop.
Small pieces of bone, ashes and the
symbol of the triangle accentuate the
ritual and spiritual culture of Hindu
gypsies, while a central portrait of a
black virgin represents the imposition
of Christian beliefs upon Hindu reli
gion, according to Mesa-Bains, an
educational consultant to the San
Francisco School District.
Mesa-Bains' theory is that as the

gypsies migrated to Spain and other
parts of Europe, the church Chris
tianized their black triple-goddess
Kali into a Virgin Mary figure. This
same phenomenon occurred after
Spain's conquest of Mexico, when the
Toltec goddess Tonatsin became the
Virgin of Guadalupe.
In contrast to Mesa-Bains* large al
tar piece, Sacramento artist Kim
Scott creates miniature dolls garbed
in ancient-looking costumes. Chad
wick writes in her gallery notes that
these "fetish dolls" relate ritualisti
cally to Egyptian, Chinese, Japanese,
and American folk art.
Scott said her intention was to
mesh various cultural influences into
her figurines, as she borrowed ele
ments from Native American Indian
and East Asian artistry.
Scott's "Skeleton Woman" (1982)
exemplifies the artist's desire to con
vey messages of intimacy through
these "personal pieces/' A small
mummy figure, encased in reddish
wrappings, hangs from a fiberglass
pole and a paper skeleton masks its
face and torso.
"The skeleton piece represents life
and living gracefully, you know, not
always being afraid of death," Scott
said.
The wood, feather, paper and
string craft work of Dominic DiMare
shares the miniature scale of Scott's
dolls, but the ritual element is that of
man's daily existence.
Though his burial pyres and shrines
have an American Indian flavor,
Chadwick said the artist's main inspi
ration was his father's day to day exis
tence as a Sicilian-born fisherman.
Just as DiMare's father ritually
worked the fishing net, the artist
vicariously relives his father's exis
tence by tying the thousands of knots
that go into his string work.
A resident of Tiburon, DiMare said
he identifies his artistry with water,
and to the "uniqueness and fragility
of all of us."
Other pieces of the "Rituals" ex
hibit include dance costume creations

by Carlos Villa; rugs and acrylic on
cloth hangings by Harmony Ham
mond; ink drawings and oil paintings
by Oliver Jackson; and a photograph
sequence by Jak Tanenbaum.
More of a family-oriented exhibit
than "Rituals," "Visible/Invisible"
contains holograms, paintings and
prints that "rely on the magic of illu
sion to capture the unseen presences

around us," as Chadwick wrote for
the exhibition's wall plaque.
One piece transmits a person s
voice patterns via microphone to or
ange. red and blue light bulbs, which
react best to low growls or high
pitched squeaks.
Another innovative work, "Passing
Through"' ( 1985) by Richard Berger.
consists of white steel mesh wires that
form a cushion chair. Other black and
multi-colored wires accentuate the
chair's form, while blue and red beads
create the illusion of a ghost's torso,
buttocks and legs passing through the
piece of furniture.
Jeanne Aurel-Schneider's garment
piece "Black Madonna" (1984)
mounts the artist's nightgown onto
hand-made, vacuum-formed paper.
The result is a ghostly, shadowy fig
ure slightly painted with ink and
stained with tea bags.
"For me, the black Madonna is not
an evil figure, but she can see both
sides," Aurel-Schneider said. She
added that she is currently exploring
female archetypes.
Aurel-Schneider said that her
dried-cloth-on-paper art form is es
pecially meaningful to her. She
usually selects garments of people
close to her, and because she believes
the clothes capture a person s bodily
spirit, that spirit is translated into her
work.
Artists Eva Bovenzi, John Kauf
man, Eric Orr, Nathan Oliveira,
Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Laura
Raboff and John Gerard Toupin also
contribute to the "Visible/Invisible"
exhibit.
The "Rituals" and
"Visible/Invisible" exhibits close
March 30.
Jodaitis' one-man exhibit, "A
Year in Oaxaca," displays a series
of the artist's watercolors and wood
sculptures created in 1983. The
works were Jodaitis" artistic inter
pretations of what he saw during the
year he and his wife forsook their San
Jose home to live in Oaxaca, Colom
bia.


"Skeleton Woman," a small doll
sculpture by Kim Scott, is an ex
ample of what one can see at the
Palo Alto Cultural Center's ex
hibit "Rituals: A Cross-Cultural
View" through March 30.
