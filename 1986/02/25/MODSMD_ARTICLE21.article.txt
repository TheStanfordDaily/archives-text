# 'Indian' dramatizes actual story of last Yahi
## 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
The theme of the "noble savage" has
been hashed and rehashed on stage, and
when 1 first heard about "Wild Indian," I
thought it unlikely that Theodore Shank's
latest play could have anything new to say
about such an old topic.
But saying something new isn't what
Shank is trying to do. Rather, by telling us
a true story simply and well, he merely
wants to remind us of what we already
know and often forget.
"Wild Indian," which opened two weeks
ago at the Magic Theatre, was inspired by
the story of Ishi, an Indian who wandered
into San Francisco some pre-dawn morn
ing in 1918, and in doing so literally
walked out of the Stone Age and into the
Industrial Revolution.
Ishi was a California Yahi Indian.
Unlike the great native American nations
of the East and Midwest, the California
tribes had had very little contact with
European civilizations and were as ig
norant of horses and rifles as Montezuma
had been of Spanish armor.
Yahi Indians hunted with stone arrows

and pounded acorns into flour — that is,
until the white man stole their land and
slaughtered them. The Yahi were quickly
eliminated during the Gold Rush years,
and in 1870 Ishi was the "Last Yahi."
With his surprise arrival in San Fran
cisco, Ishi became an overnight sensation.
The "wild indian" wandered into the life
of anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, who
brought him to a San Francisco museum
and turned him into a living exhibit.
Ishi's confrontation with the modern
world forms the stuff of Shank's play —
and it is powerful material indeed. Half
circus-freak and half tool-of-science, Ishi
lives as a willing volunteer in an absurd
museum exhibit that is a "recreation" of a
Yahi camp — complete with a taxidermed
coyote.
Kroeber is so intent on transcribing Yahi
language and preserving Yahi traditions
that he forgets that Ishi is a human being
and not another Indian relic.
As the play progresses, Ishi (Martin
Pistone) becomes increasingly able to
communicate with Kroeber, his colleague
Hilary Addison (Allison Studdiford), and
assistant Wing Su (Cecilia Pang). His at
tempts to learn the English language and

white culture are discouraged by Kroeber,
who worries that the more anglicized Ishi
becomes, the more he'll forget or suppress
his Yahi origins.
What Kroeber fails to consider is that
Ishi might not want to dwell in a past in
which his friends and family were brutally
slaughtered, and might not want to be the
sole preserver of an extinct culture.
Despite his 1890's pop-culture acquisi
tions — Ishi insists on wearing Anglo
clothes, and a toy railroad (replica of the
Gov. Leland Stanford) that's sent to him
becomes his prized possession — Ishi
remains a Yahi. He continues to make
stone tools and bows, and most impor
tantly, keeps his belief in Yahi religion.
The one thing he demands of Kroeber is
that when he dies his body remain intact.
To an Indian, dismembering means that a
person's spirit can never enter into the
land of the dead. When Kroeber agrees to
this, Ishi tells Kroeber that he is his "true
and only friend."
Ishi's efforts to "fit in" are tolerated,
then encouraged by Kroeber's assistant
and colleague, both of whom are trying to
"fit in" themselves. Wing Su is an Asian
trying to decide the difference between

"selling out" and adapting her Eastern
roots into her new Western life, and Stud
diford must choose between her affection
for Kroeber and the realization that she'll
never be a part of the male world he in
habits.
These struggles force Kroeber to play
the heavy, and as a result, Michael
Cadigan has quite a tough role to fill. He
almost does it, but it's hard to make the
Great White Hunter a sympathetic charac
ter, and despite Shank's and Cadigan's ef
forts, Kroeber often comes across as such.
The other three actors in the play have
prettier roles, and they play them well —
Studdiford's slow realization that museum
work is basically "dead" fits in with Ad
dison's increasingly assertive presence on
stage.
Pistone's character is the one we sympa
thize with most. Shank and Pistone have to
be careful not to exploit this sympathy.
They don't, except perhaps when Ishi, in
dream-narratives, tells us the story of the
slaughter of his family. Pistone also does a
good job of making us realize Ishi is quite
intelligent, despite his struggle to com
municate in English.

forts, Kroeber often comes across as such.
The other three actors in the play have
prettier roles, and they play them well —
Studdiford's slow realization that museum
work is basically "dead" fits in with Ad
dison's increasingly assertive presence on
stage.
Pistone's character is the one we sympa
thize with most. Shank and Pistone have to
be careful not to exploit this sympathy.
They don't, except perhaps when Ishi, in
dream-narratives, tells us the story of the
slaughter of his family. Pistone also does a
good job of making us realize Ishi is quite
intelligent, despite his struggle to com
municate in English.

The theme of the "noble savage" has
been hashed and rehashed on stage, and
when 1 first heard about "Wild Indian," I
thought it unlikely that Theodore Shank's
latest play could have anything new to say
about such an old topic.
But saying something new isn't what
Shank is trying to do. Rather, by telling us
a true story simply and well, he merely
wants to remind us of what we already
know and often forget.
"Wild Indian," which opened two weeks
ago at the Magic Theatre, was inspired by
the story of Ishi, an Indian who wandered
into San Francisco some pre-dawn morn
ing in 1918, and in doing so literally
walked out of the Stone Age and into the
Industrial Revolution.
Ishi was a California Yahi Indian.
Unlike the great native American nations
of the East and Midwest, the California
tribes had had very little contact with
European civilizations and were as ig
norant of horses and rifles as Montezuma
had been of Spanish armor.
Yahi Indians hunted with stone arrows

and pounded acorns into flour — that is,
until the white man stole their land and
slaughtered them. The Yahi were quickly
eliminated during the Gold Rush years,
and in 1870 Ishi was the "Last Yahi."
With his surprise arrival in San Fran
cisco, Ishi became an overnight sensation.
The "wild indian" wandered into the life
of anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, who
brought him to a San Francisco museum
and turned him into a living exhibit.
Ishi's confrontation with the modern
world forms the stuff of Shank's play —
and it is powerful material indeed. Half
circus-freak and half tool-of-science, Ishi
lives as a willing volunteer in an absurd
museum exhibit that is a "recreation" of a
Yahi camp — complete with a taxidermed
coyote.
Kroeber is so intent on transcribing Yahi
language and preserving Yahi traditions
that he forgets that Ishi is a human being
and not another Indian relic.
As the play progresses, Ishi (Martin
Pistone) becomes increasingly able to
communicate with Kroeber, his colleague
Hilary Addison (Allison Studdiford), and
assistant Wing Su (Cecilia Pang). His at
tempts to learn the English language and

white culture are discouraged by Kroeber,
who worries that the more anglicized Ishi
becomes, the more he'll forget or suppress
his Yahi origins.
What Kroeber fails to consider is that
Ishi might not want to dwell in a past in
which his friends and family were brutally
slaughtered, and might not want to be the
sole preserver of an extinct culture.
Despite his 1890's pop-culture acquisi
tions — Ishi insists on wearing Anglo
clothes, and a toy railroad (replica of the
Gov. Leland Stanford) that's sent to him
becomes his prized possession — Ishi
remains a Yahi. He continues to make
stone tools and bows, and most impor
tantly, keeps his belief in Yahi religion.
The one thing he demands of Kroeber is
that when he dies his body remain intact.
To an Indian, dismembering means that a
person's spirit can never enter into the
land of the dead. When Kroeber agrees to
this, Ishi tells Kroeber that he is his "true
and only friend."
Ishi's efforts to "fit in" are tolerated,
then encouraged by Kroeber's assistant
and colleague, both of whom are trying to
"fit in" themselves. Wing Su is an Asian
trying to decide the difference between

"selling out" and adapting her Eastern
roots into her new Western life, and Stud
diford must choose between her affection
for Kroeber and the realization that she'll
never be a part of the male world he in
habits.
These struggles force Kroeber to play
the heavy, and as a result, Michael
Cadigan has quite a tough role to fill. He
almost does it, but it's hard to make the
Great White Hunter a sympathetic charac
ter, and despite Shank's and Cadigan's ef
forts, Kroeber often comes across as such.
