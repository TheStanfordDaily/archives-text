## Puts or calls... Investing in options can be a 'Risky Business' 
### KEN SAWYER Editorial staff 
"Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad."
"Goodbye, son. Take good care of
the house while we're gone."
"Sure, Mom. Have a good trip."
"Tim, I'm leaving you a check for
Stanford on the counter. Don't forget
to mail it in before we get those darn
deferment fees tacked on."
"Yeah, yeah. I got it. Goodbye."
No sooner had Tim Vest's parents
stepped out the front door, Tim's best
friend, "Bugger," came in through the
back entrance. Bugger blurted, "All
right dude, your parents are out of
town, let's party. Only two weeks
before we'll be back on the Farm with
shitloads of work to do."
"I don't know Bugger, I don't want
to trash the house and.. .."
"Lookee here. Tim's parents
have left him a check for $4,286,
and they forgot to write in Stanford
University. Have I got a plan for you,
Tim Vest. We are going to invest that
money in some stock options. In two
weeks, you'll have your money back
and enough extra to buy a Porsche.
Then you can tool around Stanford in
style."
"Wait just a sec Bugger, options
are risky business. I can't afford to
lose that tuition money."
"Hey, some times you've just got to
say, 'What the.
"O.K. Bugger, tell me about these
options."
"There are two types of options:
Calls and Puts. A call option gives
you the right to buy a specific stock at
a fixed price within a fixed period of
time. A put option gives you the right
to sell a specific stock at a fixed price
by a fixed date.
"A call option works as follows:
We go out and purchase a call option,
which is a written promise that allows
us to purchase 100 shares of stock at a
certain price at any time during the
next nine months (or less). We must
pay a 'premium,' or price, for that
option, but it will be worth it.
"You see, if the market value of the
stock rises, we will make a huge profit
because we can 'exercise' the option.
That means we can purchase the
stock at the price stipulated on the
option and resell the stock at the
higher price."

"What happens if the stock price
doesn't move up?" asked Tim.
"Well, then we wouldn't want to
exercise our option, and we would
lose the money we paid to buy the
option in the first place. However, if
we expect the price of the stock to go
down, we can buy a put option.
"Put options are, in effect, the op
posite of call options. If we bought a
put option we would have the right to
sell a certain stock at a specified price.
If the market value of the stock de
clines, we can buy the stock at the
market, and then exercise' our option
and resell the stock at the price
specified on the option."
"All right Bugger, you've con
vinced me. Let's invest this money in
options."

Such a silver screen scenario may
seem a little far fetched for most
Stanford students, but for at least a
couple of students, a similar episode
was indeed very real. Seniors Craig
Miott and Howard Pein, along with
now graduated Rick Sprague, Dario
Trevino and Scott Jensen invested
$11,000 in the stock market two
years ago — and doubled their money
in less than three months.
Miott explained, "We bought a
bunch of stock in a local computer
company and did quite well. Unfor
tunately, we were unable to buy op
tions for the stock and had to buy
more shares on margin (credit) to ef
fectively increase our leverage.
"It was at this point that the nag
ging worry of being in debt really got
to me. From there on, I decided to in
vest in options."
Options have two main advantages
over stocks: they offer limited expo
sure and provide greater leverage. If
you own the stock and the company
goes bankrupt you lose everything
you invested. However, if you own
call options and the company goes
bankrupt all you lose is the premium
you paid for the option. This is why
options have limited exposure.
Additionally, options provide gre
ater leverage. Imagine that Coca-
Cola is selling for $50 per share. Call
options at $50 (the fixed price at
which you can buy the stock) are sel
ling for a $5 premium. If you have

$5,000, you can buy 100 shares of
stock or 10 calls covering 1,000
shares of stock.
If Coca-Cola goes to $60, you
would make a $1,000 profit if you
owned the 100 shares of stock. How
ever, if you owned the call options,
you would have made a $5,000 profit.
Of course, if the stock stays at $50,
you would lose no money if you
owned the stock but would lose the

premium price of the options had you
purchased them.
Miott has purchased options sev
eral times; both for himself and
through the Blyth Fund, and has yet
to lose money. Miott is a director and
acting treasurer of the fund, and gen
erally considered an options
specialist.
He said, "My favorite option has
been Disney calls. Disney has gone

from $68 to over $ 125 and I've either
bought or recommended options on
Disney a number of times. I've always
sold the options before they've ex
pired though. I've never actually ex
ercised an option."
Options can be traded just like
stocks. The premiums (price for the
option) go up and down just as the
price of stocks do. There are three
factors that determine the price of an

option: intrinsic value, time value,
and volatility of the underlying stock.
The intrinsic value is based on how
much the stock's price is above or
below the exercise price of the option.
Obviously, an option that is "in the
money," the exercise price is below
that of the stock (in the case of a call),
is worth more than an option that is
"out of the money."
The time value of an option is
based solely on how much time re
mains before the option expires. An
option that has nine months until ex
piration is worth decidedly more than
one which has only three days until
expiration. This is because there is a
greater chance for the price of the
stock to move into the money in nine
months than in three days.
The third factor that determines
the price of an option is the volatility
of the underlying stock. If a stock has
the tendency to move (fluctuate)
widely, there is more chance that at
some time the option will be in the
money.
Miott gives a stern warning,
though, to students who think about
trading in options. "Just because you
know how the premiums are deter
mined and a little about options
doesn't mean you can trade them.
Few people can trade stocks success
fully, let alone options. The ex
changes offer options because they
are popular with experienced inves
tors. Many people, however, invest in
options without knowing what they
are doing.
"You have to watch options closely
because the prices move dramatically.
Money can disappear," Miott said.
Indeed, there are so many compli
cated investing strategies with options
that an average investor can quickly
become confused. The Securities and
Exchange Commission cautions, "In
view of the high degree of risk as
sociated with options transactions,
and the need to closely watch the
price movements of the underlying
stocks, such an investment requires
careful attention and a thorough
knowledge of market trends."
Certainly, options are risky busi
ness. Saying "What the . . before
investing a tuition check could leave
students shaking their heads and
saying "What the ..." a few weeks
later.
