## UCLA topples Stanford in Pauley, 95-74 Miller leads young Bruins 
### ADAM BERNS Special to The Daily 
LOS ANGELES â€” Sometimes one has to wonder
whether UCLA junior forward Reggie Miller has his own
special helium-filled basketballs.
Last night, Miller scored 37 points against Stanford in
UCLA's 95-74 victory, and no shot appeared to be out
side Miller's range. He made 16-of-22 field goal at
tempts, most of them from outside 20 feet.
"Thank God for Reggie Miller," UCLA coach Walt
Hazzard said. "He's a great player, really a great player.
He's one of the greatest shooters I've ever seen, and I've
played with the great Jerry West. Reggie ranks with the
very best."
The victory over Stanford was an important one for
Miller, who was visibly upset after losses to Stanford and
California earlier this year. Following that Northern
California road trip, Miller vowed that he would not lose
to Stanford or Cal again.
So far, Miller has done his part to even the score with
the Bay Area teams, scoring 64 points against the schools
when they journeyed to Pauley Pavilion. He had 27 points
in UCLA's 76-63 victory over Cal last Thursday.
"1 was embarrassed when we lost up there," Miller said
last night. "It was not a team thing. It was my own pride,
my own goals."
Miller shot from everywhere last night, and his shots
rarely hit anything but net. So impressed was the official
scorer that on the play sheet he described one of Miller's
shots as a "29-foot archer from the 90025 zip code," and
another was a "rainbow from the 818 area code."
At one point late in the game, Miller actually took a
couple of steps back before sinking a 25-foot set shot.
When asked from what range he prefers shooting. Miller
said, "Oh, about 25-30 (feet out)."
Miller, whose sister Cheryl at USC knows a thing or two
about scoring points, entered last night's game averaging
25.5 points per game and has averaged 26.9 points in
Pacific 10 Conference play. He leads the conference in
scoring and last week was the No. 4 scorer in the nation.
Miller, however, would rather talk about team goals
than individual exploits.
"Individual goals don't mean that much," he said. "It
was a team effort tonight. Most of the time they (Stan
ford) were playing zone tonight and Montel (Hatcher) and
I were getting the open shots."
Miller's 37 points last night were only two short of his
career high of 39 against Arizona, but he was not espe
cially impressed with his effort.
"Last night was OK," he said. "It was a slow night."
