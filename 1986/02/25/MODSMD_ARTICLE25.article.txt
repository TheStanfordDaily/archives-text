# Outside marksmen overwhelm Card

### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Going into last
night, the Stanford men's basketball
team had lost all 21 games it had
played in Pauley Pavilion.
Make that 22. Forward Reggie
Miller scored 37 points to lead UCLA
to a 95-74 victory over the Cardinal
in front of 6,441 here.
The loss dropped Stanford into a
fifth-place tie with Oregon State at
7-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference, four
games behind league leaders Arizona
and Washington. Stanford is now
mathematically eliminated from the
race for the Pac-10 title. The Cardinal
is 13-13 overall.
With the victory, UCLA moved
into fourth place at 8-7, a half-game
behind third-place California, which
defeated USC last night, 65-63. The
Bruins are 13-11 overall.
UCLA took a 46-39 halftime lead
and extended that to 64-52 at the
1 1:10 mark when Miller hit a jumper
from somewhere in Orange County.
Stanford got no closer than 10 points
after that.
"They passed the ball well, shot
extremely well and got down court
well," Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said. "We were beaten by a fine team.
They played extremely well. I think if
they play so-so, we stay with them.
They just played an outstanding
game."
UCLA shot 62 percent from the
field to Stanford's 42 percent. Miller
led the long-range attack with a 16-
of-22 performance, followed by
guard Montel Hatcher with 8-of-ll
shooting and 17 points and Pooh
Richardson, who was 6-of-9 with 14
points.
Stanford has had problems stop
ping outside shooters — as people
like Arizona's Steve Kerr, Arizona
State's Steve Beck and Cal's Kevin
Johnson will attest — and last night
was no exception. The Bruins' three
outside starters combined for 68

points and shot 71 percent on the
night.
"It wasn't just Miller." Davis said.
"Hatcher was on as well, and
Richardson played a pretty good
game. That three-pronged attack is
impossible for us to stop. It" it's just
Reggie Miller, we can stop them. I
think tonight it was impossible for us
to stop them."
"The way Stanford plays defense,
they take a lot of chances," UCLA
Coach Walt Hazzard said. "They left
him (Miller) open a lot — he basically
had a set shot. We just had to work
the ball around two or three times
and we had an open shot."
Davis pointed to the season-long
loss of guard Steve Brown with a
stress fracture in his right tibia as part
of the Cardinal's problem.
"1 think if we had a great defensive
guard — a stopper." Davis said when
asked what the Cardinal had to do to
shut down outside attacks. "Steve
Brown is a great defensive guard, but
now we'll never know if he could do
it."
"It's very rare to find that kind of
player. We're trying to develop that
in a couple of our guards. 1 think
Todd Lichti can be that kind of
player. 1 think to win night in and
night out we need a stopper."
Lichti was a rare kind of offensive
player last night. He scored 26 points
in only 29 minutes, many coming on
creative drives that kept the Cardinal
from total humiliation. He also led
Stanford with seven rebounds.
"He's playing great basketball for
us," Davis said. "He's carried us as
far as we've gone. We lost our two
best players (Brown and Earl Kober
lein) and we're still battling— I think
Todd Lichti is a big part of that."
Stanford's superiority inside
couldn't offset the Bruins' ICBM
launching. Center Howard Wright
was matched up against Jack Haley, if
not the worst starting center in the
Pac-10, certainly the most maligned.
Wright scored eight points, two under
his season average before fouling out
with three minutes to play. Haley also
scored eight, doubling his average.
Cardinal forward Greg Butler also
had a good offensive night, going 6-
for-7 from the field and finishing with
13 points. Guard Novian Whitsitt
scored 12 points, but had an off-night
shooting, hitting only five of his 17
shots.
The loss was not only Stanford's
22nd straight in Pauley since it was
built in 1965, but it was the Cardinal's
41st straight at UCLA since 1952. It
also prevented a Stanford sweep of
the Bruins for the first time since
1942.
As the defending champions of the
National Invitational Tournament,
UCLA will probably only have to
finish with a winning record to receive
another NIT bid. Stanford, on the
other hand, will probably have to
finish ahead of the Bruins and Cal to
avoid staying home to watch the
tournament action.

Davis wasn't sure of anything,
though. "There are a lot of variables
left," he said. "We're just going to try
to win as many games as we can.
We've got our work cut out for us.
There are no guaranteed wins left."
Stanford returns home after a
five-day stay here to host Oregon
State on Thursday and USC on
Saturday. The Cardinal finishes the
regular season the following week
with games at Washington and
Washington State.
