# Batsmen get revenge against Santa Clara
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — It's the sort of plea that's
commonly associated with a certain television
game show. But these days, it's just as approp
riate wherever and whenever the Stanford
baseball team plays.
"Will the real Cardinal nine please stand up?
Please ?
Is Stanford the team that drubbed Santa
Clara 11-4 yesterday and 19-2 Saturday? Or
can we expect repeats of Sunday's dismal 5-2
loss to the same Broncos? Those are
questions that need answering, and soon —
league play starts Friday against Arizona in
Tucson.
Coach Mark Marquess, who has seen his
Stanford club go through ups and downs in the
season's early going, hopes the Cardinal, I 1-4
after yesterday's win. has finally found its place.
"That was the best game we've played as a
team this year," he said. "We finally played a
solid, complete baseball game. Now all we have
to do is maintain that level."
Stanford pounded out 15 base hits yesterday,
five of which were for extra bases. But that's
scarcely a day after the team managed but five
hits off three Bronco pitchers. "Our offense has
been inconsistent," Marquess said. "Hopefully,
we'll get more steady with that thing."
The Cardinal exploded in the top of the sec
ond, eventually driving starter and loser Scott
Chimparino, 0-1, from the mound. Leading off.
John Ramos lined a single to center, then
moved to second on Doug Robbins' ground
single to left. Both runners advanced on a sac
rifice bunt.
Ed Sprague, starting at third base in place of
Mark Machtolf, poked Chimparino's 3-2 offer
ing between first and second to score Ramos
with Stanford's first run.
As it turned out, Sprague's hit opened the
flood gates. Stanford poured six more runs ac

ross in the inning. Ken Green, making his first
ever start at second base for Stanford, blooped a
run-scoring base hit to right center. Shortstop
Frank Carey then walked to load the bases.
Stanford's third run scored on Walt Harris'
fielder's choice grounder; its fourth came across
on an error by shortstop Steve Clinton. With
two out, Harris on third and Toi Cook on first,
Stanford executed the old double steal. Harris
trotted home when catcher Mike Medeiros
threw down to second trying to catch Cook.
Ramos, up for the second time in the inning,
drove in the sixth and seventh runs with a one
hop drive to the left field wall for a double.
Just for good measure, Stanford added two
more runs in the third, one in the eighth and
another in the ninth on Ruben Amaro's first
home run of the year.
While Stanford was busy posting
numbers on its half of the scoreboard, Steve
Chitren stifled Santa Clara's bats. The freshman
right-hander pitched eight innings for the win.
scattering seven hits and giving up three runs.
" The key to my pitching is to throw my cur
veball for strikes and to keep my fastball down,"
Chitren said afterward. "I was using my cur
veball as my strikeout pitch." He struck out
eight and walked two on the day.
Through the first five innings, Chitren faced
only one more batter than the minimum 15.
During that stretch, only one Bronco runner ad
vanced into scoring position — Joe Coslin
reached second with a bloop double in the sec
ond.
Chitren ran into some trouble in the sixth. A
leadoff walk to left fielder Dave Bearden and
back-to-back one-out singles produced Santa
Clara's first run.
After a smooth seventh inning, Chitren
weakened again in the bottom of the eighth. "I
began to feel a little bit tired," he said. "I
thought I still had good velocity on my fastball.

Freshman shortstop Frank Carey's caution on the basepaths
was not mirrored by his Stanford teammates, who were

thrown out stealing twice and picked off once yesterday
against Santa Clara.
but 1 didn't have the good movement
on my breaking pitch anymore."
Jeff Deßono's one-out single with
runners on second and third scored
one Santa Clara run. Another came
across on a groundout to first.
Marquess was pleased with the
showing of his freshman pitcher. "I
thought Chitren looked super out
there today. He had good command
of both hiscurveball and fastball."
Another freshman righty, Brian
Keyser, pitched the ninth, yielding a
run on four singles.
Stanford travels to the University
of San Francisco today for a 2 p.m.
game.
Card notes
Marquess' running game, which
has been swiping bases at a record
pace this year, was held in check by
Bronco catchers. Stanford executed
the first-and-third double steal in the
second, but two other runners were
thrown out and another picked off.
