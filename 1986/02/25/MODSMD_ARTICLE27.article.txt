# Tennis looks for winning combo

### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Whenever an oasis seems to ap
pear over the horizon, there s al
ways the chance that it's just a
mirage.
The Stanford men's tennis team
might be wise to keep that in mind
today when it hosts the University
of San Diego Toreros in what ap
pears to be a perfectly scheduled
match for the Cardinal.
The Toreros should give the
Stanford squad a break from the

grueling competition it faced hist
weekend while still providing the
Cardinal with the opportunity to
stay match sharp.
"It's hard to concentrate bet
ween two tourneys (Stanford will
play in the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships beginning Fri
day)." Stanford coach Dick Gould
said yesterday. "So it's good to
have a match today to keep us
tuned up."
Don't write San Diego off as
another Stanford victory just yet,
however. The Toreros have won four
out of their last five matches, includ
ing a big 8-1 victory over Santa Clara
on Sunday. In addition, three of San
Diego's losses came against the na
tionally ranked USC, UCLA and
Arizona squads.
One more thing to consider is that
Stanford will probably be without its
top two singles players, Dan Goldie
and Jim Grabb. Goldie received a
wild-card bid and will be playing in a

tournament in La Quinta this week.
Grabb is still doubtful for singles due
to an injury.
"I don't know what to expect."
Gould admitted. "We beat them
pretty easily last year, but that was
with a full lineup."
With Goldie and Grabb unavaila
ble. Gould has juggled his lineup con
siderably for today's l: 30 p.m. match.
Red-hot sophomore Patrick McEn
roe will move up from No. 4 to No. I
singles. McEnroe is the only unde
feated Cardinal player this season,
going 5-0 in singles and 3-0 in dou
bles.
Senior Eric Rosenfeld will play No.
2 singles, and he will probably be
followed by John Letts, Scott Moody
and Mark Jacobson. Cardinal junior
Geordie McKee will make his singles
debut this season in the No. 6 singles.
On the other side of the nets, San
Diego's Jim McNamee will try to
spoil McEnroe's move to the top.
McNamee is 5-5 on the year playing
No. I singles.
The Toreros also feature two good
freshmen. David Stewart is 6-4 this
season at the No. 2 spot, while fellow
frosh Takeshi Omono is 5-5 at the
sixth spot.
