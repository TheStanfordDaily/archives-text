### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
After watching his team narrowly avoid two up
sets last weekend in Arizona. Stanford women's
tennis coach Frank Brennan gratefully accepted an
easy match yesterday.
"My blood pressure is starting to go down."
Brennan said after seeing the top-ranked Cardinal
shutout visiting San Jose State 9-0.
"San Jose put up a good fight." Brennan said.
"There were some good matches. It's another step
ping stone for us for the big matches this weekend."
Yesterday's match was not only a convincing
team victory for the Cardinal but also an important
individual match for junior Patty Fendick and
freshman Marianne Werdel.
The talented pair failed to win a singles match in
Arizona, but yesterday, both Fendick and Werdel
won in singles and doubles. "Some of the players

saw hell in the face this weekend." Brennan said. " I
don't think anything can scare them now."
Fendick. who Brennan considers to be the best
collegiate women's tennis player in the nation, de
feated the Spartans' Kelly Simons 6-3. 6-2. "I am
still very shaky right now." Fendick said after the
match. "This wasn't really a big test."
Fendick indicated that she is not losing any sleep
over her poor showing in Arizona. "This isn't really
a slump." she said. "I've lost two matches. I'm not
too worried about it as long as the other people pull
through. 1 think I'm on the right track again."
Werdel. the top-rated freshman in the nation,
was shaky at Arizona, losing Saturday afterwinning
the first set 6-0. Yesterday, however, she disposed
of SJSU's Kristen Kildebrand 6-3. 6-1.
"She played a good match." Brennan said.
"She's had such a great (junior) career that she's
nevr been in a slump like this before. But I think
she's dealing with it great.

The only close singles match yesterday involved
the Cardinal's Stephanie Savides and SJSU's
Chandra Thompson. Savides edged Thompson in
the No. 3 singles by a 7-5. 6-4 score.
In the No. 4 singles match. Stanford's Kay Tittle
upped her dual match singles record to 4-0 by
knocking off the Spartans' Shellv Stockman 6-4.
6-1.
Alyce Werdel and Sonya Kazazian rounded out
the singles play, winning at No. 5 and No. 6 for the
Cardinal. Werdel. Marianne's older sister, defeated
the Spartans' Vivian McAdam 6-2. 7-6, and Kaza
zian pummelled SJSU's Anh-Dao Espinosa, 6-1,
6-0.
By the time the doubles teams took to the court,
the Cardinal had already clinched the victory,
making its season record 4-0. All three doubles
teams were victorious, led by Fendick and Leigh
Anne Eldredge. who shut out McAdam and
Thompson. 6-0. 6-0.
