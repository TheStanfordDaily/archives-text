Synch swimming
Despite being shaded 104-102 by
Arizona, the Stanford synchronized
swimming team was encouraged by
its performance against a Wildcat
squad which finished second in the
nation last year.
"It was really close," Stanford
club president Marcia Fetterman
said of the meet. "We're real ex

cited about that because normally
we don't get that close to Arizona."
Leslie Tackett and Dee Cohan led
the Stanford squad over a Wildcat
team which boasts two national
team members.
Cohan and Tackett finished
fourth and sixth, respectively, in in
dividual figures. Tackett came back
to cop second place in solo swim
ming. It was her first loss of the year
in solos.
Cohan and Tackett combined for
second in the duet, which was also
the first>defeat of the season for the
duo.
The team of Megan Magley and
Ann Scheck finished a strong fourth
for the Cardinal.
In the trio competition, the busy
pair of Cohan and Tackett was
paired with Jeri Cane, and the group
notched a second.
Stanford's eight-swimmer groups
took second and third to round out
the Cardinal's scoring.
Stanford coach Andy Maisel said
the meet "was a big improvement
from the week before,"
"I think everybody swam a little
better," Maisel said. "It's real good
to come that close to a team that
finished No. 2."
