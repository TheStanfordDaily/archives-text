# Koppel to speak at graduation
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
"Nightline" anchorman Ted Kop
pel will speak at Stanford's June 15
Commencement ceremonies.
The Stanford graduate accepted a
written invitation from University
President Donald Kennedy yester
day, ending a drawn-out speaker
selection process that saw informal
invitations go to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, comedian Bill
Cosby and Soviet dissident Andrei
Sakharov.
Koppel, who has won fame as the
cool-headed referee on ABC-TV's
late-night interview program, told
Kennedy that he can imagine no
greater honor than speaking to Stan
ford's 1986 graduates.
"The thought of compelling some
of my old professors to listen to me in
silent and (at least the appearance of)
rapt attention is . . . almost enough in
itself," Koppel wrote Kennedy.
Senior Class President Leslie Dar
win said last night that she is glad the
speaker selection process is finally
over.
"I'm thrilled to have a Com
mencement speaker," she said.
"We're pleased to have someone, and
I'm happy to have Koppel because I
think he'll have a lot to say to the
class."
Earlier this month, the four senior
class presidents invited Gorbachev to
speak at Commencement, but left
open the opportunity for him to speak
at another time if the proposed
Reagan-Gorbachev summit does not
occur in June, as originally planned.
A cover letter from Kennedy
seemed to endorse the seniors' invi
tation, but did not refer to Com
mencement specifically, and Univer
sity spokesmen later said Gorbachev
had been issued only an "open invi
tation." and had not been invited to
spe<ik at Commencement.
Days later, the senior class presi
dents asked Kennedy to invite Cosby,
but the comedian refused to speak
when Stanford refused to grant him
an honorary doctorate.
Last week, a group of students and
faculty members invited Sakharov,
the Soviet physicist exiled in Gorky,
to visit Stanford, preferably during
Commencement week.
Finally, Koppel, who placed just

after Gorbachev and Cosby in a
speaker poll conducted among
seniors, yesterday accepted an official
invitation to speak.
Senior Mark Fleischauer, who led
the petition drive to invite Gor
bachev, said last night he is pleased
that Koppel has accepted the Univer
sity's invitation, but maintained that
Gorbachev still has first rights to
speak at Commencement.
"If Gorbachev says yes, then (the
University) will have to make alter
nate arrangements," he said. "Maybe
Koppel can interview him."
Darwin, however, said she believes
the chance of Gorbachev accepting
Stanford's invitation is "next to nil."
But when asked who would speak if
Gorbachev accepts the invitation, she
said, "We'll cross that bridge if it
happens."
"i think our pursuit of Gorbachev
is a beautiful gesture, and this doesn't
take anything away from that," Dar
win said. "Koppel was way up there,
and I don't think we should look at
him as a second or third choice."
Darwin said she believes Koppel
will give an inspirational speech that
will appeal to both parents and
graduates.
Koppel, who was born in Britain,
received his bachelor's degree in
journalism at Syracuse and a master's
degree in speech and drama here in
1962.
He began his journalism work as a
radio correspondent, but switched to
ABC-TV three years later, becoming
the network's Hong Kong bureau
chief and spending nearly two years
reporting in Vietnam. During the
Nixon and Ford Administrations, he
worked as a diplomatic correspon
dent.
In 1976. Koppel shocked his col
leagues by giving up his diplomatic
beat to become a house husband
while his wife, Stanford graduate
Grace Anne Dorney, began law
school.
While on leave from ABC. Koppel
wrote the diplomatic intrigue
bestseller "In the National Interest"
with NBC correspondent Marvin
Kalb.
Koppel returned to reporting in
1977, working the diplomatic beat
and filling in as a part-time anchor on
ABC's "America Held Hostage," the
nightly news program on the Iranian
hostage crisis that evolved into
"Nightline" in 1980.
"Nightline" has slowly built an au
dience of more than 5 million viewers
each night, and Koppel, enthusiastic
about the journalistic opportunities
"Nightline" presents, turned down a
chance to leave the show and become
ABC's "World News Tonight" an
chorman in 1983.
Known as a conservative in a busi
ness dominated by liberals, Koppel is
perhaps the most widely respected
television journalist, drawing praise
from both colleagues and subjects for
his tough but fair treatment of the
news.
Time magazine calls him the
"thinking person's anchor" with a
"buttoned-down style and unflappa

hie calm" and a mind that works at
"express-train speed."
Off the show, Koppel is known for
his quick wit and dead-on imperso
nations of the political figures he has
covered.
During a recent appearance on
"Late Night with David Letterman."
for example, Koppel impersonated
Richard Nixon and William F.
Buckley Jr. and balanced a dog bis
cuit on his nose.
Koppel will speak at Stanford
Stadium, the site of two previous
Commencement ceremonies. Presi
dent Herbert Hoover spoke there in
1935, and New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo spoke there last year.
Archbishop Rembert Weakland,
the chairman of the National Confer
ence of Catholic Bishops' Ad Hoc
Committee on Catholic Social
Teaching and the U.S. Economy, will
deliver the baccalaureate address on
Saturday, June 14.

He began his journalism work as a
radio correspondent, but switched to
ABC-TV three years later, becoming
the network's Hong Kong bureau
chief and spending nearly two years
reporting in Vietnam. During the
Nixon and Ford Administrations, he
worked as a diplomatic correspon
dent.
In 1976. Koppel shocked his col
leagues by giving up his diplomatic
beat to become a house husband
while his wife, Stanford graduate
Grace Anne Dorney, began law
school.
While on leave from ABC. Koppel
wrote the diplomatic intrigue
bestseller "In the National Interest"
with NBC correspondent Marvin
Kalb.
Koppel returned to reporting in
1977, working the diplomatic beat
and filling in as a part-time anchor on
ABC's "America Held Hostage," the
nightly news program on the Iranian
hostage crisis that evolved into
"Nightline" in 1980.
"Nightline" has slowly built an au
dience of more than 5 million viewers
each night, and Koppel, enthusiastic
about the journalistic opportunities
"Nightline" presents, turned down a
chance to leave the show and become
ABC's "World News Tonight" an
chorman in 1983.
Known as a conservative in a busi
ness dominated by liberals, Koppel is
perhaps the most widely respected
television journalist, drawing praise
from both colleagues and subjects for
his tough but fair treatment of the
news.
Time magazine calls him the
"thinking person's anchor" with a
"buttoned-down style and unflappa

hie calm" and a mind that works at
"express-train speed."
Off the show, Koppel is known for
his quick wit and dead-on imperso
nations of the political figures he has
covered.
During a recent appearance on
"Late Night with David Letterman."
for example, Koppel impersonated
Richard Nixon and William F.
Buckley Jr. and balanced a dog bis
cuit on his nose.
Koppel will speak at Stanford
Stadium, the site of two previous
Commencement ceremonies. Presi
dent Herbert Hoover spoke there in
1935, and New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo spoke there last year.
Archbishop Rembert Weakland,
the chairman of the National Confer
ence of Catholic Bishops' Ad Hoc
Committee on Catholic Social
Teaching and the U.S. Economy, will
deliver the baccalaureate address on

"Nightline" anchorman Ted Kop
pel will speak at Stanford's June 15
Commencement ceremonies.
The Stanford graduate accepted a
written invitation from University
President Donald Kennedy yester
day, ending a drawn-out speaker
selection process that saw informal
invitations go to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, comedian Bill
Cosby and Soviet dissident Andrei
Sakharov.
Koppel, who has won fame as the
cool-headed referee on ABC-TV's
late-night interview program, told
Kennedy that he can imagine no
greater honor than speaking to Stan
ford's 1986 graduates.
"The thought of compelling some
of my old professors to listen to me in
silent and (at least the appearance of)
rapt attention is . . . almost enough in
itself," Koppel wrote Kennedy.
Senior Class President Leslie Dar
win said last night that she is glad the
speaker selection process is finally
over.
"I'm thrilled to have a Com
mencement speaker," she said.
"We're pleased to have someone, and
I'm happy to have Koppel because I
think he'll have a lot to say to the
class."
Earlier this month, the four senior
class presidents invited Gorbachev to
speak at Commencement, but left
open the opportunity for him to speak
at another time if the proposed
Reagan-Gorbachev summit does not
occur in June, as originally planned.
A cover letter from Kennedy
seemed to endorse the seniors' invi
tation, but did not refer to Com
mencement specifically, and Univer
sity spokesmen later said Gorbachev
had been issued only an "open invi
tation." and had not been invited to
spe<ik at Commencement.
Days later, the senior class presi
dents asked Kennedy to invite Cosby,
but the comedian refused to speak
when Stanford refused to grant him
an honorary doctorate.
Last week, a group of students and
faculty members invited Sakharov,
the Soviet physicist exiled in Gorky,
to visit Stanford, preferably during
Commencement week.
Finally, Koppel, who placed just

after Gorbachev and Cosby in a
speaker poll conducted among
seniors, yesterday accepted an official
invitation to speak.
Senior Mark Fleischauer, who led
the petition drive to invite Gor
bachev, said last night he is pleased
that Koppel has accepted the Univer
sity's invitation, but maintained that
Gorbachev still has first rights to
speak at Commencement.
"If Gorbachev says yes, then (the
University) will have to make alter
nate arrangements," he said. "Maybe
Koppel can interview him."
Darwin, however, said she believes
the chance of Gorbachev accepting
Stanford's invitation is "next to nil."
But when asked who would speak if
Gorbachev accepts the invitation, she
said, "We'll cross that bridge if it
happens."
"i think our pursuit of Gorbachev
is a beautiful gesture, and this doesn't
take anything away from that," Dar
win said. "Koppel was way up there,
and I don't think we should look at
him as a second or third choice."
Darwin said she believes Koppel
will give an inspirational speech that
will appeal to both parents and
graduates.

received his bachelor's degree in
journalism at Syracuse and a master's
