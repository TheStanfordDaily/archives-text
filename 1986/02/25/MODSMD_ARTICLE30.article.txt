# Fencers drop Cal in weekend action

### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
Another victory almost seems an
ticlimactic for the consistently vic
torious Stanford fencing teams, but
it's especially satisfying to know that
their victim for the season's final
matchup just happened to be Califor
nia.
On Saturday, Roble Gym was the
site of the Cardinal's resounding vic
tory in its second match of the season
against Cal. The women stomped the
Bears 13-3 to end the season at 14-0.
The men scored a 16-11 win, bringing
them to 14-1 for the season.
Cal brought out the beast on the
women's side. "Although Cal was
somewhat stronger than in our first
matchup, our win wasn't in doubt
from the first bout,'' Stanford coach
Buzz Hurst said. "The women were
faster and more aggressive right down
to the alternates."
According to Hurst, "There is cer
tainly no question in my mind that we
have one of the strongest women's
teams in the country." Jennifer Yu
closed out her final season with 49
dual meet victories and no defeats.
This brings her dual meet career at

Stanford to 183-10, a 95 percent
winning percentage. Holly Taylor
ended her season at 39-4, Allison
Reid finished with a 41-6 record and
Alyson Yarus ended up with 22 vic
tories.
If the women's dominance failed to
provide much suspense, the men
compensated with the excitement of a
close match.
"Cal turned out to be a pretty for
midable opponent," Hurst said.
"They put up an extremely good
fight. They fenced very strongly in foil
and pretty much went to the mat with
us in epee." Once again, the team was
helped by a strong (9-0) performance
from the sabre team.
"The performance of the sabre
team determined the outcome of the
meet," Hurst said. Captain Andy
Goorno finished his final season at
Stanford with a record of 36-10 and
an 87 percent winning percentage for
his four-year career. "He has defi
nitely been the rock-solid fencer on
the men's team this year," Hurst said.
The men are looking forward to
Saturday's Western Regional Cham
pionships at Foothill College, which
will feature the top seven men's teams
in the region.
