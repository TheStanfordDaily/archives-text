Reagan calls for regime end
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, ending a 20-year U.S. alliance
with President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, called yesterday for
an end to the Marcos government after learning that the beseiged leader
was preparing to attack two military camps in which opposition forces
had taken refuge.
"Attempts to prolong the life of the present regime by violence are
futile," White House spokesman Larry Speakes said in a statement au
thorized by Reagan and released early yesterday. "A solution to this
crisis can only be achieved through a peaceful transition to a new gov
ernment."
Only a dozen hours before, Speakes had said that Reagan did not have
the right to ask Marcos to resign. A White House official said that
Reagan's dramatic reversal in position was an attempt to head off a
bloody civil war.
"Such an attack could lead veiy rapidly to civil war, and no one
wanted that to happen," said the official, who noted that the two military
camps were located in the suburbs of Manila and were surrounded by
thousands of citizens protesting against Marcos. "We didn't want a situ
ation where the Philippine government was firing on its own people."
Word that Gen. Fabian Ver, the armed forces chief of staff and a Mar
cos loyalist, was planning an attack on the camps reached the White
House around 1 a.m. PST yesterday. Chief of staff Donald Regan and
national security adviser John Poindexter awakened Reagan at 5 a.m. to
advise him of the unsettling development and get his authorization for
the statement calling on Marcos to step down.
The White House remained poised to provide a plane to fly Marcos
out of the country and, if he should ask, grant him asylum in the United
States. And presidential envoy Philip Habib left Washington last night to
return to Manila.
Speakes said Reagan regarded Marcos as "a longtime friend and ally"
and was willing to do what he could to ease his departure from power
and avert further bloodshed. Another official drew a parallel with the re
cent situation in Haiti, where the Administration sent a military C-141 to
fly the deposed Jean Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier to a safe haven in Fr
ance.
The Administration had indications beginning last Thursday, Speakes
said, that a rebellion led by Philippine Defense Minister Juan Ponce En
rile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, deputy chief of staff of the armed forces,
was brewing.
And a spokesman for Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said that U.S. officials might have tipped off En
rile that Marcos was planning to arrest him — thus precipitating the
rapid sequence of events that culminated with Enrile and Ramos pub
licly breaking with Marcos and barricading themselves in the two camps.
Enrile has said he learned about Marcos' plan to arrest him and
Ramos on Saturday morning and immediately called the general to
launch their revolt. He has refused to say how he learned of the arrest
plan, adding that he acted with no specific assurance of backing from the
United States.
"We only depended on our perception that the United States is a fair
country," he said.
Long Gulf war ahead
BASRA, Iraq — A key field commander in the Iraqi counterattack
against Iranian troops holding the southern tip of Iraq's Faw Peninsula
on the Persian Gulf, yesterday backed off earlier predictions of a quick
victory, admitting that the water-logged terrain of salt marshes and
flooded plains made for "slow and difficult going."
Lt. Gen. Maher Abdel Rashid, commander of Iraq's 3rd Army Corps,
who last week was pulled off his normal front north of this port city to
lead one of three counterattacking Iraqi columns moving toward
Iranian-held Faw, told reporters visiting his field headquarters 30 miles
south of here that he was no longer prepared to predict when his troops
would retake the oil terminal town that Iran captured in a surprise am
phibious assault Feb. 9.
Rashid said, though, that he remained sanguine about an ultimate, and
total, Iraqi victory. "Either we will liberate Faw," he said, "or we will all
die as martyrs."
Since Iranian shelling began in the first weeks of the war, Faw has
been virtually abandoned by its former residents. Until Iran's amphibi
ous and helicopter-borne assault two weeks ago, it was occupied only by
troops from Iraq's 7th Army Corps, which was badly mauled in the at
tack and has had to be reinforced by troops from Bashdad and some of
Rashid's for the counterattack.
Western intelligence sources, basing their estimates on satellite photos
of the battle zone, said Iran has put about 30,000 troops into Faw this
month. That estimate was not disputed by Rashid yesterday. He claimed
that the Iranians had been putting "a division a night" across the bridge.
A division normally totals abut 10,000 men.
Rashid indicated that aside from the difficulties of the water-logged
terrain and vagueries of weather, one reason Faw would not be recap
tured as quickly as he had previously hoped was that the Iraqi army was
hoping to avoid storming the well-entrenched Iranian positions with in
fantry. Iraq has sought to minimize casualties throughout the five
and-one-half-year-old war against more populous Iran.
Duvalier is guarded
TALLOIRES, France — French authorities have tightened security
around ousted Haitian President Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier,
now in the 17th day of seclusion in a luxury Alpine hotel.
An 85-member heavily armed police squad, backed by seven intelli
gence officials, was placed on round-the-clock patrol Sunday at the Ab
baye hotel to guard Duvalier and his 10-member entourage.
Visitors to the hotel are now being asked to show identity papers and
explain the reasons for the visit, and pedestrians have been banned from
walking along a nearby lakeside path.
The French authorities said they gave Duvalier permission to stay in
France only for seven days, but no country has agreed to accept him.
His presence here is seen as a growing political embarrassment for the
Socialist government in the runup to the March 16 legislative elections.
Extradition is sought
VICTORIA. British Columbia — Canada is seeking extradition of a
San Franciscan in connection with the slaying of a wealthy American
widow on a cruise ship off Vancouver Island last summer.
"A provisional warrant has been obtained and we're awaiting extradi
tion of the accused," Crown Counsel Dirk Ryneveld said yesterday.
"I've laid a charge of first-degree murder and we anticipate the trial will
be here (Victoria)."
The body of Muriel Barnett, 80, was found in her luxury stateroom on
a Norwegian cruise ship Aug. 19. She was bludgeoned to death with a
champagne bottle.
The ship was heading for San Francisco after a cruise to Alaska and
had just completed a stop in Victoria when the body was found. Robert
Frisbee. who had been with her. was arrested after the ship docked.
A court in San Francisco dropped charges against Frisbee. 58. due to
lack of jurisdiction. The ship was in Canadian waters when the offense is
alleged to have happened.
Frisbee, a longtime private secretary and traveling companion of Bar
nett and her late husband, is in jail in San Francisco. He was arrested
when the liner docked there.
It is not known when Frisbee will be returned or when the trial will
begin, Ryneveld said.
Frisbee's lawyer. V. Roy Lefcourt, said Friday he would push for a
quick trial in Canada and attempt to get Frisbee released on bail.
