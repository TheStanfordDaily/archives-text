MANILA, Philippinesâ€” Rebels battling to oust
President Ferdinand Marcos swore in Corazon
Aquino as president of their provisional govern
ment today at a country club guarded by the milit
ary and a wall of cheering civilians.
Marcos remained in the presidential palace,
struggling to hold on to power. He had scheduled a
private inauguration for 8 p.m. PST yesterday.
Earlier today, 10 people were reported wounded
when soldiers fired at crowds of jeering Aquino
supporters outside the palace and in a clash at a
rebel-held government television station.
"1 and Salvador Laurel are taking power ... in
the name of the Filipino people," Aquino said in
accepting the rebel declaration of her presidency.
Laurel, her vice-presidential running-mate in the
Feb. 7 election she says she won, will be prime
minister in her new government, she said.
Before she was sworn in, a proclamation signed
by about 60 opposition legislators in the 190-
member National Assembly was read. It said: "We
proclaim Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel the
duly elected president and vice president respec
tively, entitled to the recognition, obedience and
allegiance of the Philippine people."
Reading of the proclamation was drowned out by
the crowd chanting "Cory, Cory," Aquino's
nickname.
The inauguration of Aquino, 53, as president of
the rebel-proclaimed government had been
scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. PST yesterday, but she
appeared three hours later at the Club Filipino.
People arriving for the ceremony were searched by
the troopers.
The two military chieftains who on Saturday
launched the revolt against Marcos left Camp
Crane where they had been entrenched since
Saturday and flew by helicopter to the club.
Former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and
Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, who had been deputy armed
forces chief, arrived at the hall with a dozen soldiers
escorting them. Before leaving the camp, Ramos

told reporters, "Some 85 percent of the armed
forces of the Philippines is solidly under our con
trol."
A thousand Aquino supporters filled the hall,
with about 3,000 others outside. The club is a pri
vate establishment patronized by many of Manila's
wealthy and was frequently used by Aquino for
political meetings in her campaign.
Marcos, 68, who said yesterday his family was
"cowering" in terror inside the Malacanang Palace,
has clung to power although the United States and
other Western governments say his election victory
over Aquino was achieved by fraud and he should
step down.
Helicopter gunships, apparently piloted by re
bels, attacked Villamor Air Base adjacent to the
Manila International Airport, which remained
open Tuesday, although some flights were can
celed.
Ramos said the Aviation Security Command that
is responsible for the Manila airport had defected
to the insurgents and "normal activity at the
domestic and international airport has resumed."
In the clashes this morning, soldiers fired on
rebel supporters near the presidential palace. Hos
pital officials said eight people were wounded in the
shooting and Five were injured while trying to flee
the gunfire. At least two people were wounded in
fighting near the rebel-held television station,
Channel 4.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians defied a
dusk-to-dawn curfew overnight to form human
protective shields around the stations and suburban
Camp Crane, where the military rebels had first
proclaimed Aquino president on Sunday.
Witnesses said masses of people at the television
station had driven back seven armored personnel
carriers loaded with loyalist soldiers at midnight
yesterday.
Marcos appealed to loyalists to bring guns to the
capital and defend him. In a broadcast on Channel
9 television, a private station owned by an as

sociate, he said: "We will defend the republic to the
last breath of our life, the last drop of our blood.
Several top government officials have resigned.
Some diplomats serving abroad declared allegiance
to Aquino.
Fighting began near the main television station
shortly before it was to broadcast Aquino's inaugu
ration ceremony.
Channel 4 announcers said troops "believed to
be loyal to Marcos" were occupying a tower at
Channel 9, the private station about 300 yards
away that Marcos used after rebels took over the
government channel.
Aquino, who could hear the firing from the
Quezon City area, appealed to her supporters to
stay close to the facilities they have been protect
ing.
"I would like to appeal to our countrymen . . .
Just a little while ago I've been hearing all this fir
ing going on, so please cease and desist from killing
innocent people. We've gone through this with as
little bloodshed as possible and I would like for us
to continue in this peaceful struggle."
She made the comments in a statement broadcast
by Channel 4, which did not say where she was. Her
home is in Quezon City.
The Reagan administration called on Marcos to
relinquish power peacefully. "Attempts to prolong
the life of the present regime by violence are
futile," it said in a statement yesterday. " A solution
to this crisis can only be achieved through a peace
ful transition to a new government."
A Washington congressional source said the Un
ited States offered Marcos a U.S. aircraft to use in
leaving the Philippines. The State Department and
Pentagon had no immediate comment.
Marcos said earlier, in response to President
Reagan's pledge to cut off military aid if Marcos
attacked his opponents: "1 make my own decisions.
The U.S. government has its own interests to take
care of, and we have our national interests to take
care of."
