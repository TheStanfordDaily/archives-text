# Reagan responds to Soviets
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Re
agan has proposed that the United
States and Soviet Union agree to
"fast-track reductions" of
intermediate-range missiles to elimi
nate them from both Europe and
Asia within three years, the White
House announced yesterday.
Responding to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's offer to rid
Europe of the weapons in five to
seven years, Reagan apparently
sought to recapture the public rela
tions momentum on arms control by
urging that the timetable be speeded
up and the scope broadened to in
clude the Far East.
But at the same time, he rejected
two conditions Gorbachev had at
tached to his Jan. 15 offer, thereby
dimming prospects for an early
breakthrough resulting from the new
proposal.
Reagan's public statement included
no details of his offer, but Administ
ration officials said it called for 50
percent cuts per year for three years
in Europe, with "concurrent propor

tionate cuts in Asia."
Thus, a total of about 140 Pershing
2 and cruise missiles are deployed in
Europe and none are in Asia, the
Soviets enjoy an advantage in
warheads of 1,323 to 140.
Administration officials said
Reagan's plan also contained stiff
verification requirements to monitor
any reductions, including destruction
of removed missiles and on-site in
spection of productions facilities as
well as launching sites.
Perhaps as a "sweetener," one offi
cial said, the president's proposal
hinted that the United States might
be willing to replace its Pershing 2's
with shorter-range Pershing 1-B mis
siles, which could not reach the Soviet
Union. The Pershing 2 has a range of
about 1,200 miles, while the Pershing
1-B has a range of about 500 miles.
In a letter to Gorbachev and in de
tails presented at the U.S.-Soviet
arms control talks in Geneva, Reagan
reaffirmed U.S. proposals for a 50
percent in long-range nuclear offen
sive forces. But in that area and that

of space defense weapons, which the
Soviets want totally banned, he made
no new proposals beyond the offers
he made before last November's
summit with Gorbachev.
The Soviet leader had called for
total elimination of all nuclear
weapons in three stages by the year
2000, but a statement from Reagan
said that many of the details in the
Soviet plan "are clearly not approp
riate for consideration at this time."
"In our view, the total elimination
of nuclear weapons will require, at
the same time, the correction of the
conventional and other force imba
lances, full compliance with existing
and future treaty obligations, peace
ful resolution of interference and a
demonstrated commitment by the
Soviet Union to peceful competi
tion," he said.
Reagan rejected Gorbachev's call
for a freeze on British and French
intermediate-range missiles, as well
as a U.S. pledge not to transfer such
weapons to any ally.
He is understood to have replied

that our focus should remain on the
prompt pursuit of first steps in curb
ing both intermediate- and long
range offensive arms, Reagan said.
But both sides appear to be concen
trating on limiting the intermediate
range missiles. That area holds out
the most hope for an early agreement,
perhaps even before the next
Reagan-Gorbachev summit later this
year.
Two weeks ago, the Administration
had tentatively decided to respond to
Gorbachev by proposing the elimina
tion of European intermediate-range
missiles and a 50 percent cut in Soviet
missiles in Asia. However, U.S. allies
on both continents raised various
objections to that approach during
visits by American arms experts.
As a result, three new options were
devised that both repackaged and
changed marginally the tentative
plan. Rather than accepting one,
however, the White House aides
"took a little from each one and mas
saged it their own way" to produce
the new offer, one U.S. official said.
