Court to review tax bill
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court
agreed yesterday to an accelerated review of a
key provision of the Gramm-Rudman budget
balancing law, setting the stage for a ruling on the
constitutionality of the precedent-setting legisla
tion by this summer.
The justices announced that they would hear
two hours of oral argument in the case April 23,
indicating they then would decide the issue be
fore they recess in early July.
The case not only involves billions of dollars in
federal spending but also represents a major test
of the constitutional separation of powers the
"checks and balances" dividing authority among
the branches of government.
At issue is the law's mechanism for instituting
automatic, across-the-board budget cuts when
Congress fails to meet its deficit-reduction
targets. The law places that authority in the hands
of the comptroller general, who is the head of the
General Accounting Office, a watchdog auditing
and investigative agency
Earlier this month, a special three-judge panel
of the federal district court here struck down that
mechanism as unconstitutional. The panel said

that the law improperly placed the enforcement
powers reserved for the executive in the hands of
an official who, unlike members of the presi
dent's Cabinet, can be removed from office by
Congress.
Lawyers for the Senate, House and the com
ptroller general filed appeals with the Supreme
Court. The Department of Justice, along with a
group of 12 congressmen and the National
Treasury Employees Union, urged that the
panel's ruling be upheld.
The panel left intact a "fall-back" provision in
the law allowing Congress itself to enact the
deficit-reduction cuts prepared by the comptrol
ler general.
Pelotte named bishop
CLEVELAND — The first U.S. Roman
Catholic bishop of native American descent was
named yesterday for the Diocese of Gallup,
N.M.. where nearly half of its church members
are native Americans.
The Very Rev. Donald Pelotte, a descendant
of the Abenaki tribe of the Algonquin Indians,
will be ordained coadjutor bishop in Gallup on

May 3. Pelotte, who turns 41 on April 13, will be
one of the youngest American bishops.
Pelotte, who will make his first trip to Gallup
next week, said the Diocese of Gallup covers
55,000 square miles, half in northwestern New
Mexico and half in northern Arizona. It com
prises three Indian reservations.
The diocese is the poorest in the nation, and is
considered a missionary diocese, Pelotte said.
