Apathy besieges polls
SAN DIEGO — Apathy may decide today's
special mayoral election with officials predicting
that fewer than 30 percent of the city's registered
voters will go to the polls.
With today being the fifth time voters have
selected a mayor since 1983. the interest has
waned.
Many of the candidates — there are 14 on to
day's ballot along with two write-ins — say scan
dals that led to the Dec. 10 resignation of Roger
Hedgecock as the city's 30th mayor have alien
ated voters and made them apathetic to city gov

cinment.
Two current members of City Council are the
subject of district attorney's investigations.
Voter turnout has dwindled in recent elections.
The November municipal election featured
races for half of the eight City Council district
representatives and a land-use initiative yet man
aged to attract only 28.1 percent of the voters.
The September election that preceded it drew
only 16 percent of the voters, the lowest turnout
ever in a city election.
"If you look at the past, there's no pattern
ecept that (voter participation) is going down,"
city elections officer Dean Klampe said.
The mayor's job in San Diego is ceremonial

because day-to-day operations are handled by a
city manager. In addition to paying $50,000 a
year, the mayor's job has been viewed as a
springboard to higher office. Pete Wilson used his
11-year tenure as a base for a successful bid for
the U.S. Senate.
Klampe said if there is a victor in today's elec
tion, he or she could take office within 10 to 30
days.
More warm weather
Morning fog and low clouds becoming mostly
sunny this afternoon. Highs in the 60s to mid 70s.
Light winds.
