# Research funding cuts worry officials here
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Proposed reductions in federal funding for
medical research and education have officials at
the Medical School struggling to minimize the
cuts and preparing for some "rough sledding."
I he hardest-hitting cuts have been proposed
in the area of sponsored research. "Those kinds
of hits are very important to us. We're very sen
sitive to them." said David Mendelow, associate
dean for administration at the Medical School.
Under the budget President Reagan submit
ted to Congress earlier this month, funding for
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would

be reduced by $293 million for the rest of fiscal
1986 and an additional $131 million in fiscal
1987. The Medical School receives approxi
mately 86 percent of its funding for sponsored
research from the NIH, accounting for nearly
$65 million in research money for fiscal 1985. A
reduction in the number of NIH grants has also
been proposed.
Exact estimates of the potential loss to Stan
ford range between $200,000 and $400,000 this
year to between $1.7 million and $3 million in
1987, he said.
Mendelow also warned that changes in the
way certain costs of research are calculated
could result in a significant loss of funds to the

Medical School. The changes, proposed two
weeks ago by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) would affect all federally spon
sored research at Stanford, capping the rate at
which the government pays for administrative
costs indirectly related to research.
A 30-day comment period on the OMB
proposed changes is now about half over, and
University President Donald Kennedy and
other Stanford officials are lobbying to prevent
or delay implementation of the changes.
The new rules would result in an $85 million
cut in government payments for indirect costs of
research, according to a report by the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).

The changes are unfair and illogical, accord
ing to Mendelow, because they would base
reimbursement for the administrative portion of
indirect costs of reserch on average costs re
ported by all universities. Because of the tax
dollars state-supported universities receive for
overhead, administrative costs and other indi
rect costs of research, they "have little or no in
centive to develop schedules that are truly re
flective of what the true indirect costs are.
That's the lunacy of compiling an average,"
Mendelow said.
The worst-case scenario facing the Medical
School is a combination of the new
OMB rules and the imposition of au
tomatic budget cuts, because the
Medical School would be hit with a
"double whammy," according to
Mendelow. "If the direct costs of re
search are reduced, the amount you
recover (for indirect costs of re
search) are also reduced, but the basis
on which you calculate these (indi
rect) costs has already been reduced,
so you get, in effect, a double
whammy."
Because revenues from the gov
ernment for direct and indirect costs
of research account for 46.5 percent
of the Medical School's $157 million
budget, a large part of the budget "is
what's at stake with the games that
the feds are playing," Mendelow said.
The president's proposed budget
meets the requirements set by the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings com
promise passed by Congress in De
cember with the goal of eliminating
the federal deficit over the next five
years. The law creates a mechanism
for making automatic spending cuts
— half in domestic programs and half
in defense — in the event that Con
gress fails to meet spending limits set
for each year through 1991. Au
tomatic reductions would occur each
March if the target reductions were
not met.
Members of Congress are trying to

forge a compromise to avoid the au
tomatic cuts. "It is unclear which cuts
are worse," said Cindy Bedont, a
legislative analyst in Stanford's Office
of Public Affairs.
Changes proposed by Reagan in
the Guaranteed Student Loan pro
gram would also affect students at the
Medical School because they include
the requirement that students begin
paying interest on the loans while still
in school. A survey by the AAMC in
1984 found that the mean total in
debtedness of Stanford Medical
School graduates was $4,000 higher
than the figure for all other schools.
While Medical School adminis
trators are "not forecasting gloom
and doom," Mendelow said, "we're
in for rough sledding."
For the Stanford Hospital, federal
budget cuts will not have the same
magnitude as they will on the Medical
School and the University in general,
according to David Sakai, director of
finance for the hospital.
Cuts in Medicare, the federal
health insurance program for the el
derly, are limited to 1 percent in fiscal
1986 and 2 percent in following years
under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
The hospital budget is already
under strain. Currently, hospital
employees are participating in an in
tensive review process in order to
determine where extensive cutbacks
in personnel and programs can be
made by April 1. Hospital President
Sheldon King and Deputy Director
William Arnold announced a month

ago that $25 million in budget cuts
will be necessary because of shorter
hospital stays and a declining demand
for in-patient care in recent years.
The reconciliation budget Congress
is currently negotiating would entail
an estimated $2.5 million in losses to
Stanford from Medicare, and effects
of automatic cuts, while unclear,
"would be worse," Sakai said.
For reimbursements to health care
providers under Medicare, the Ad
ministration's proposed budet allows
for a 2 percent increase in 1987, but
automatic cuts would trigger a 2 per
cent decrease.
Proposals by both Congress and the
administration would also put limits
on what the government pays under
the Medicare program for capital
costs and direct costs of teaching
interns and residents. The proposals
would reduce by about a third the
adjustment for indirect costs of
teaching, which recognize the greater
severity of illness in the patient
populations of teaching hospitals.
Stanford ranks as one of the highest
in the nation in terms of severity of
illness of the patients.
Several University officials have
travelled to Washington, D.C. and
elsewhere in recent weeks to meet
with associations of hospitals and uni
versities and to lobby members of
Congress to make funding changes
they find fairer than current proposals
or the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.

Congress to make funding changes
they find fairer than current proposals
or the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
Proposed reductions in federal funding for
medical research and education have officials at
the Medical School struggling to minimize the
cuts and preparing for some "rough sledding."
I he hardest-hitting cuts have been proposed
in the area of sponsored research. "Those kinds
of hits are very important to us. We're very sen
sitive to them." said David Mendelow, associate
dean for administration at the Medical School.
Under the budget President Reagan submit
ted to Congress earlier this month, funding for
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would

be reduced by $293 million for the rest of fiscal
1986 and an additional $131 million in fiscal
1987. The Medical School receives approxi
mately 86 percent of its funding for sponsored
research from the NIH, accounting for nearly
$65 million in research money for fiscal 1985. A
reduction in the number of NIH grants has also
been proposed.
Exact estimates of the potential loss to Stan
ford range between $200,000 and $400,000 this
year to between $1.7 million and $3 million in
1987, he said.
Mendelow also warned that changes in the
way certain costs of research are calculated
could result in a significant loss of funds to the

Medical School. The changes, proposed two
weeks ago by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) would affect all federally spon
sored research at Stanford, capping the rate at
which the government pays for administrative
costs indirectly related to research.
A 30-day comment period on the OMB
proposed changes is now about half over, and
University President Donald Kennedy and
other Stanford officials are lobbying to prevent
or delay implementation of the changes.
The new rules would result in an $85 million
cut in government payments for indirect costs of
research, according to a report by the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).

The changes are unfair and illogical, accord
ing to Mendelow, because they would base
reimbursement for the administrative portion of
indirect costs of reserch on average costs re
ported by all universities. Because of the tax
dollars state-supported universities receive for
overhead, administrative costs and other indi
rect costs of research, they "have little or no in
centive to develop schedules that are truly re
flective of what the true indirect costs are.
That's the lunacy of compiling an average,"
Mendelow said.
The worst-case scenario facing the Medical
School is a combination of the new
OMB rules and the imposition of au
tomatic budget cuts, because the
Medical School would be hit with a
"double whammy," according to
Mendelow. "If the direct costs of re
search are reduced, the amount you
recover (for indirect costs of re
search) are also reduced, but the basis
on which you calculate these (indi
rect) costs has already been reduced,
so you get, in effect, a double
whammy."
Because revenues from the gov
ernment for direct and indirect costs
of research account for 46.5 percent
of the Medical School's $157 million
budget, a large part of the budget "is
what's at stake with the games that
the feds are playing," Mendelow said.
The president's proposed budget
meets the requirements set by the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings com
promise passed by Congress in De
cember with the goal of eliminating
the federal deficit over the next five
years. The law creates a mechanism
for making automatic spending cuts
— half in domestic programs and half
in defense — in the event that Con
gress fails to meet spending limits set
for each year through 1991. Au
tomatic reductions would occur each
March if the target reductions were
not met.
Members of Congress are trying to

forge a compromise to avoid the au
tomatic cuts. "It is unclear which cuts
are worse," said Cindy Bedont, a
legislative analyst in Stanford's Office
of Public Affairs.
Changes proposed by Reagan in
the Guaranteed Student Loan pro
gram would also affect students at the
Medical School because they include
the requirement that students begin
paying interest on the loans while still
in school. A survey by the AAMC in
1984 found that the mean total in
debtedness of Stanford Medical
School graduates was $4,000 higher
than the figure for all other schools.
While Medical School adminis
trators are "not forecasting gloom
and doom," Mendelow said, "we're
in for rough sledding."
For the Stanford Hospital, federal
budget cuts will not have the same
magnitude as they will on the Medical
School and the University in general,
according to David Sakai, director of
finance for the hospital.
Cuts in Medicare, the federal
health insurance program for the el
derly, are limited to 1 percent in fiscal
1986 and 2 percent in following years
under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
The hospital budget is already
under strain. Currently, hospital
employees are participating in an in
tensive review process in order to
determine where extensive cutbacks
in personnel and programs can be
made by April 1. Hospital President
Sheldon King and Deputy Director
William Arnold announced a month

ago that $25 million in budget cuts
will be necessary because of shorter
hospital stays and a declining demand
for in-patient care in recent years.
The reconciliation budget Congress
is currently negotiating would entail
an estimated $2.5 million in losses to
Stanford from Medicare, and effects
of automatic cuts, while unclear,
"would be worse," Sakai said.
For reimbursements to health care
providers under Medicare, the Ad
ministration's proposed budet allows
for a 2 percent increase in 1987, but
automatic cuts would trigger a 2 per
cent decrease.
Proposals by both Congress and the
administration would also put limits
on what the government pays under
the Medicare program for capital
costs and direct costs of teaching
interns and residents. The proposals
would reduce by about a third the
adjustment for indirect costs of
teaching, which recognize the greater
severity of illness in the patient
populations of teaching hospitals.
Stanford ranks as one of the highest
in the nation in terms of severity of
illness of the patients.
Several University officials have
travelled to Washington, D.C. and
elsewhere in recent weeks to meet
with associations of hospitals and uni
versities and to lobby members of
Congress to make funding changes
they find fairer than current proposals
or the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
