# Research funding cuts worry officials here

### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Proposed reductions in federal funding for
medical research and education have officials at
the Medical School struggling to minimize the
cuts and preparing for some "rough sledding."
I he hardest-hitting cuts have been proposed
in the area of sponsored research. "Those kinds
of hits are very important to us. We're very sen
sitive to them." said David Mendelow, associate
dean for administration at the Medical School.
Under the budget President Reagan submit
ted to Congress earlier this month, funding for
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would

be reduced by $293 million for the rest of fiscal
1986 and an additional $131 million in fiscal
1987. The Medical School receives approxi
mately 86 percent of its funding for sponsored
research from the NIH, accounting for nearly
$65 million in research money for fiscal 1985. A
reduction in the number of NIH grants has also
been proposed.
Exact estimates of the potential loss to Stan
ford range between $200,000 and $400,000 this
year to between $1.7 million and $3 million in
1987, he said.
Mendelow also warned that changes in the
way certain costs of research are calculated
could result in a significant loss of funds to the

Medical School. The changes, proposed two
weeks ago by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) would affect all federally spon
sored research at Stanford, capping the rate at
which the government pays for administrative
costs indirectly related to research.
A 30-day comment period on the OMB
proposed changes is now about half over, and
University President Donald Kennedy and
other Stanford officials are lobbying to prevent
or delay implementation of the changes.
The new rules would result in an $85 million
cut in government payments for indirect costs of
research, according to a report by the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).

The changes are unfair and illogical, accord
ing to Mendelow, because they would base
reimbursement for the administrative portion of
indirect costs of reserch on average costs re
ported by all universities. Because of the tax
dollars state-supported universities receive for
overhead, administrative costs and other indi
rect costs of research, they "have little or no in
centive to develop schedules that are truly re
flective of what the true indirect costs are.
That's the lunacy of compiling an average,"
Mendelow said.
The worst-case scenario facing the Medical
