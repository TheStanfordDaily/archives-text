# Drops predicted in charitable giving
## Colleges to fight tax changes 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the fourth in a scries of arti
cles fiK using on the effects of recent
federal tax legislation on the Univer
sity.
Colleges and universities around
the country are preparing to lobby
U.S. senators to change provisions in
the tax code that could greatly affect
charitable giving.
Provisions in the Tax Reform Act
of (H R 3838) effectively reduce
the deduction for charitable con
tributions by taxpayers subject to the
alternative minimum tax (AMT) of
appreciated assets that comprise a

significant portion of large donations
to Stanford and other non-profit or
ganizations.
Educational institutions and
charities oppose the new policy, say
ing the increased tax will reduce the
incentive to give and create uncer
tainty about the effects of giving on
the tax liability of major donors.
With the Stanford Centennial
Campaign about to begin in earnest.
University fund-raisers are particu
larly concerned about the effects of
the bill on major donors who will be
crucial to the campaign's success, ac
cording to John Hays, director of
leadership gifts for the Office of De
velopment.

"We feel very clearly that the new
tax law, particularly because of its
treatment of appreciated assets, in
effect decreases the portion of the
gifts that would otherwise he paid (to
the University) and increases in
economic terms the donor's cost.'"
Hays said. "As the donor's cost of
giving [increasesl. there is a corres
ponding reduction in percentage giv
ing."
An appreciated asset is an asset,
usually stock or real estate, that has a
value greater than its cost. Ap
preciated assets may also include
"tangible" property such as art and
jewelry.
Under existing federal tax codes,
donors are allowed to deduct a per
centage of gifts to charities, colleges,
universities and other members of the
non-profit "third sector."
Taxpayers who itemize their de
ductions may deduct 100 percent of
their charitable gifts of cash up to a
limit of 50 percent of their adjusted
gross income. When giving ap
preciated assets, however, the deduc
tion limit is 30 percent of adjusted
gross income.
The controversy in the proposal
stems from including appreciation —
the difference between the cost and
current value — of the donated items
in computing the AMT. The AMT
was specifically created to ensure that
individuals wealthy enough to afford
tax shelters cannot completely avoid
taxation, said Andrew Wilcox, direc
tor of planned giving for the Office of
Development.
The AMT is computed by totaling
an individual's tax preference items,
those assets such as capital gains that
may normally escape taxation. Indi
viduals are obligated to pay the AMT
amount, currently 20 percent of all
tax preference items, if it exceeds an
individual's personal income tax lia
bility.
Before the approval of the Tax

Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act
of 1982 (TEFRA), gifts of ap
preciated assets were considered tax
preference items and considered in
computing AMT. Approval of
TEFRA effectively exempted gifts of
appreciated assets from the AMT.
The result of including appreciated
assets in the computation of the AMT
would be a "less attractive" tax de
duction, said Mark Cullinane of In
dependent Sector, a Washington
based coalition of charities and non
profit organizations. According to
Cullinane, the donor's cost of giving
would rise from 30 to 78 cents on the
dollar.
The new tax would come at a par
ticularly inopportune time for the
Centennial Campaign, a major fund
raising drive scheduled to net the
University $483 million in academic
and physical improvements over the
next 10 years.
"If one looks at many of the objec
tives of the Centennial Campaign,
there are going to be areas where in
dividual gifts are going to play an im
portant role," Hays said.
Included for funding from the $483
million are $ 150 million for the Cam
pus Near West construction and re
novation project, $150 million for
100 endowed professorships, $22
million for new student residences
and education and $25 million each
for undergraduate scholarships and
new academic programs.
Unlike the cash and equipment

usually given by corporations and
foundations, appreciated assets are
usually given by individual donors.
The fact that appreciated assets are
typically the principal component of
the largest individual gifts to the Uni
versity exacerbates the problems with
the new tax law. Hays said.
In the 1984 fiscal year, $91.8 mill
ion of the $ 112 million total of all do
nations to the University were given
in amounts of $10,000 or more. In
cluded in the $112 million was $37
million of individual gifts. Ap
preciated assets typically make up
about one-half of these large dona
tions, Hays said.
Stanford would not be alone in
suffering from ill-effects of the prop
osal. Studies conducted by Lawrence
Lindsey of Harvard University and
the National Bureau of Economic
Research estimate that the change
would reduce 1986 charitable giving
by $935 million, almost one-third
more than the predicted federal lax
revenue of $645 million.
Although Stanford may be able to
sur.'ive a decline in charitable giving,
many other institutions would be
drastically affected, Hays said. "I
think that the issue is: If you take
charitable giving away, it would fun
damentally change the country,"
Hays said. "If charitable giving dried
up across the country, then many in
stitutions would probably disappear."
Although it is impossible for ap
preciated asset giving to make up for

the decline of federal support for
many non-profit institutions, Cul
linane said the continuation of the
appreciated assets exemption might
help prevent a "massive foreclosure"
ot many programs that might other
wise end.
"Our concern is that the Senate Fi
nance Committee, as a matter of good
public policy, should encourage the
distribution of wealth for public pur
poses rather than private gain,"
Cullinane said.
Although the proposal would dis
courage charitable giving, it would
not necessarily address the problem
ot tax avoidance, a symptom that
might have motivated congressmen to
tax gifts of appreciated assets. Ac
cording to the Independent Sector, a
recent study for the House Ways and
Means Oversight Subcommittee indi
cated that itemized deductions for
charitable giving were not used by
high income taxpayers to avoid pay
ing taxes.
The tax reform proposal also per
mits a deduction for all charitable
gifts of more than $100 for people
who file the short form. Although en
couraged by the adoption of a $ 100
"floor," non-profit organizations fear
the adverse effects of sometime
habitual raising of floor levels to in
crease tax revenues. Any rise in the
floor would harm the University's
attempts to encourage usually small
donations from young alumni shortly
after graduation.

million for new student residences
and education and $25 million each
for undergraduate scholarships and
new academic programs.
Unlike the cash and equipment

usually given by corporations and
foundations, appreciated assets are
usually given by individual donors.
The fact that appreciated assets are
typically the principal component of
the largest individual gifts to the Uni
versity exacerbates the problems with
the new tax law. Hays said.
In the 1984 fiscal year, $91.8 mill
ion of the $ 112 million total of all do
nations to the University were given
in amounts of $10,000 or more. In
cluded in the $112 million was $37
million of individual gifts. Ap
preciated assets typically make up
about one-half of these large dona
tions, Hays said.
Stanford would not be alone in
suffering from ill-effects of the prop
osal. Studies conducted by Lawrence
Lindsey of Harvard University and
the National Bureau of Economic
Research estimate that the change
would reduce 1986 charitable giving
by $935 million, almost one-third
more than the predicted federal lax
revenue of $645 million.
Although Stanford may be able to
sur.'ive a decline in charitable giving,
many other institutions would be
drastically affected, Hays said. "I
think that the issue is: If you take
charitable giving away, it would fun
damentally change the country,"
Hays said. "If charitable giving dried
up across the country, then many in
stitutions would probably disappear."
Although it is impossible for ap
preciated asset giving to make up for

the decline of federal support for
many non-profit institutions, Cul
linane said the continuation of the
appreciated assets exemption might
help prevent a "massive foreclosure"
ot many programs that might other
wise end.
"Our concern is that the Senate Fi
nance Committee, as a matter of good
public policy, should encourage the
distribution of wealth for public pur
poses rather than private gain,"
Cullinane said.
Although the proposal would dis
courage charitable giving, it would
not necessarily address the problem
ot tax avoidance, a symptom that
might have motivated congressmen to
tax gifts of appreciated assets. Ac
cording to the Independent Sector, a
recent study for the House Ways and
Means Oversight Subcommittee indi
cated that itemized deductions for
charitable giving were not used by
high income taxpayers to avoid pay
ing taxes.
The tax reform proposal also per
mits a deduction for all charitable
gifts of more than $100 for people
who file the short form. Although en
couraged by the adoption of a $ 100
"floor," non-profit organizations fear
the adverse effects of sometime
habitual raising of floor levels to in
crease tax revenues. Any rise in the
floor would harm the University's
attempts to encourage usually small
donations from young alumni shortly
after graduation.
This is the fourth in a scries of arti
cles fiK using on the effects of recent
federal tax legislation on the Univer
sity.
Colleges and universities around
the country are preparing to lobby
U.S. senators to change provisions in
the tax code that could greatly affect
charitable giving.
Provisions in the Tax Reform Act
of (H R 3838) effectively reduce
the deduction for charitable con
tributions by taxpayers subject to the
alternative minimum tax (AMT) of
appreciated assets that comprise a

significant portion of large donations
to Stanford and other non-profit or
ganizations.
Educational institutions and
charities oppose the new policy, say
ing the increased tax will reduce the
incentive to give and create uncer
tainty about the effects of giving on
the tax liability of major donors.
With the Stanford Centennial
Campaign about to begin in earnest.
University fund-raisers are particu
larly concerned about the effects of
the bill on major donors who will be
crucial to the campaign's success, ac
cording to John Hays, director of
leadership gifts for the Office of De
velopment.

"We feel very clearly that the new
tax law, particularly because of its
treatment of appreciated assets, in
effect decreases the portion of the
gifts that would otherwise he paid (to
the University) and increases in
economic terms the donor's cost.'"
Hays said. "As the donor's cost of
giving [increasesl. there is a corres
ponding reduction in percentage giv
ing."
An appreciated asset is an asset,
usually stock or real estate, that has a
value greater than its cost. Ap
preciated assets may also include
"tangible" property such as art and
jewelry.
Under existing federal tax codes,
donors are allowed to deduct a per
centage of gifts to charities, colleges,
universities and other members of the
non-profit "third sector."
Taxpayers who itemize their de
ductions may deduct 100 percent of
their charitable gifts of cash up to a
limit of 50 percent of their adjusted
gross income. When giving ap
preciated assets, however, the deduc
tion limit is 30 percent of adjusted
gross income.
The controversy in the proposal
stems from including appreciation —
the difference between the cost and
current value — of the donated items
in computing the AMT. The AMT
was specifically created to ensure that
individuals wealthy enough to afford
tax shelters cannot completely avoid
taxation, said Andrew Wilcox, direc
tor of planned giving for the Office of
Development.
The AMT is computed by totaling
an individual's tax preference items,
those assets such as capital gains that
may normally escape taxation. Indi
viduals are obligated to pay the AMT
amount, currently 20 percent of all
tax preference items, if it exceeds an
individual's personal income tax lia
bility.
Before the approval of the Tax

Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act
of 1982 (TEFRA), gifts of ap
preciated assets were considered tax
preference items and considered in
computing AMT. Approval of
TEFRA effectively exempted gifts of
appreciated assets from the AMT.
The result of including appreciated
assets in the computation of the AMT
would be a "less attractive" tax de
duction, said Mark Cullinane of In
dependent Sector, a Washington
based coalition of charities and non
profit organizations. According to
Cullinane, the donor's cost of giving
would rise from 30 to 78 cents on the
dollar.
The new tax would come at a par
ticularly inopportune time for the
Centennial Campaign, a major fund
raising drive scheduled to net the
University $483 million in academic
and physical improvements over the
next 10 years.
"If one looks at many of the objec
tives of the Centennial Campaign,
there are going to be areas where in
dividual gifts are going to play an im
portant role," Hays said.
Included for funding from the $483
million are $ 150 million for the Cam
pus Near West construction and re
novation project, $150 million for
100 endowed professorships, $22
million for new student residences
and education and $25 million each
