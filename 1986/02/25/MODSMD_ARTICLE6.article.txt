# Reliving tunes of yesteryear

Three months before Paul Grushkin arrived at
Stanford in 1969, he saw a movie that changed his life.
He considered himself a pretty normal and straight kid

Feature

from Fnglewood. N.J., until he saw the movie "Mon
terey Pop," which introduced him to the culture of
rock n' roll, "of smashing and burning guitars."
At Stanford. Grushkin plunged immediately into
The Daily, eventually becoming an editor during one

of the most controversial periods at Stanford and other
college campuses.
He remembers his experience at The Daily as intense,
witnessing and writing about issues from Vietnam to the
moving of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) from
Stanford to Menlo Park because of student protest be
cause of student protest.
His interest in journalism led him to declare a major in
communication. However, he realized that the practical
experience he was receiving at The Daily was in some
ways more valuable than knowledge gained in the clas
sroom.
"As busy as I was, what blew me away was the music,"
Grushkin recalled. He wanted passionately to study the
roots of jazz and rock 'n' roll. Specifically, he wanted to
learn how the black culture figured in these two music
genres. "I was thirsty," he said. "Without thinking about
it, 1 began taking classes in black studies and American
history."
In the spring quarter of his senior year, Grushkin paid a
ceremonial visit to his adviser in the Communication De
partment. Grushkin vividly remembers the afternoon.
"He (the adviser) took one look at my transcript and
turned white. He asked me where I had been living, what I
had been doing." A second look showed that Grushkin
had completed almost every course offered in the Black
Studies Department. "So I walked across the Quad to the
Black Studies Department," he said.
The department accepted him, thanks in large part to
Prof. St. Clair Drake, who supervised his final units and
guaranteed his graduation. Grushkin remembers his
major in black studies as "one of the proudest things in my
life." That was 1974.
One evening in 1978, Grushkin was listening to the first
annual Bay Area Music Awards on the radio when he
heard Denis Erokan, the founder of BAM magazine, an
nouncethat the proceeds would go to the Bay Area Music
Archives — which did not exist at the time. The Bay Area
Music Awards, or Bammies, are a regional music awards
ceremony that continues to raise thousands of dollars each
year to benefit the archives.
The next day, Grushkin called Erokan inquiring about
the archives. Within six months, Erokan and Grushkin
had officially established the Bay Area Music Archives in
a room in Grushkin's Kensington home. Grushkin was
selected as the general curator, a position he still holds.
The initial archives in 1978 consisted of Grushkin's per
sonal collection of albums, cassettes, books and posters.
Due to generous donations from various individuals and
from large corporations such as Tower Records and Apple
Computer, the archives have expanded tremendously
since 1978.
When KSAN, a used-to-be-rock station, turned coun
try, the radio station donated its entire collection of rock
records and tapes. The jazz collections of deceased San
Francisco music critics John Wasserman and Conrad Sil-

Bert were also donated to the archives. Books, T-shirts,
tapes and old ticket stubs pour in daily.
Country Joe McDonald of Country Joe and the Fish re
cently donated his collection of books, records and
memorabilia. Currently, the archives boast approximately
25,000 albums, 2,500 audio tapes and 3,500 books, as
well as voluminous catalogs of rock journals.
As the archives expanded, more and more space was
needed. From Grushkin's house, the archives moved to a
set of suites at the Automatt recording studio. The current
archives location is adjacent to San Francisco State Uni
versity in a two-story townhouse brimming with books,
records, posters and photos, not to mention energy and
enthusiasm.
Much of the excitement these days is about plans for the
San Francisco Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. For Grushkin,
the Rock n' Roll Museum is "a dream come true/' Like
ballet, opera and the symphony, Grushkin said, rock is
"now an art form to be taken seriously." Grushkin
explained that many people who were nurtured on rock
'n roll now hold major corporate and professional posi
tions. The rock 'n' roll museum will give them a chance to
remember and appreciate again the music and literature,
and even to identify with a rock star on stage.
Grushkin wants it to be an "experiential experience."
For example, an actual soundstage with amplifiers and
monitors will be set up. In front of the bandstand will be
the projection of an audience and on the stage will be a
holographic impression of Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band. The roadie will ask "the star" of the hour if
he's ready; he will then jump on stage with guitar to be
greeted by Clarence Clemons, and the concert will begin.
Grushkin is serious about wanting people to "experi
ence it in some way." Auditory and video facilities will
enable visitors to listen to albums and cassettes or watch
concert clips on the premises. There will be recreated
scenes of a recording studio and of a blues and punk club
where visitors can participate in the mood. His eyes lit up
when he described the scene of the Palace of the Hippie
pad on the Haight dripping with black light and fluores
cent posters. Grushkin said, "It's gotta be real, right on
and it's gotta make you pant."
His active involvement with the archives, the Bammie
Awards and the future museum has not dulled his zeal for
writing and editing. In 1983, Grushkin published a book
titled "Grateful Dead: The Official Book of the Dead
Heads." The book frequently emphasizes the Dead Heads
themselves over the actual band.
Grushkin was assisted by his brother Jonas, as photo
grapher, and Cynthia Basset, as designer. Together they
worked directly with the Grateful Dead and staff to create
a scrapbook of art, photography and writing that evokes
the magic of the Dead in concert.
Currently Grushkin is in the final stages of a book titled
"The Rock Poster," which will trace the history of rock
through posters — from Elvis Presley to punk and new
wave. Future plans include a book on the Fillmores and a
book on trucks.
