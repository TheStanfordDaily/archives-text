# Scholar says U.S. missiles threaten British sovereignty
## 
### MARC GUICHARD 
Britain is losing its sovereignty and
becoming little more than "an aircraft
carrier for the United States" by al
lowing the deployment of North At
lantic Treaty Organization nuclear
forces on its territory," according to a
Stanford Anthropology Ph.D. candi
date.
Hugh Gusterson, a native of Eng
land and a long-time peace activist
there and in the United States, spoke
on the British Peace Movement yes
terday afternoon at the Bechtel In
ternational Center.
Gusterson discussed how the pre
sence of nuclear forces in Britain has
challenged that nation's democratic
principles. First by giving the United
States control over its nuclear forces,
Britain must now rely on the United
States for its protection and, in effect,
can no longer control the fate of its
territory, Gusterson told an audience
of 15.
Second, the controversy surround
ing the deployment of nuclear forces
threatens the freedom of speech in
Britain, he said. Under the Official
Secret Act, approved by British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
anyone discussing the deployment of

cruise missiles on English soil is re
vealing state secrets and performing
an act of treason.
"Objectors who are speaking out
are being labeled as communists and
even being tried for treason," Guster
son said.
Third, the economic strain of the
arms race is threatening the stability
of Britain's welfare state, according to
Gusterson.
To combat these threats to Bri
tain's sovereignty, Gusterson said the

British Campaign for Nuclear Disar
mament (CND) is calling for unilat
eral disarmament in Britain. He said
the CND wants neither Soviet nor
U.S. hegemony in Europe. "They
don't want Britain forced into taking
sides," he said.
"The CN D is trying to rip apart the
fabric of the Cold War," because U.S.
and Soviet actions only encourage es
calation of the arms race, Gusterson
said, adding that each side justifies its
need for more weapons by saying it is
only reacting to the other's action.
"They (the members of the CND)
see themselves as descendants of the
freedom fighters in Italy during
World War 11. They are trying to help
keep European nations sovereign."
Gusterson also refuted NATO's
argument that nuclear forces are
needed in Europe to balance the
Warsaw Pact's advantage in conven
tional forces. He said the two sides
have approximately the same number
of combat-ready troops available, and
even though the Warsaw Pact has
over 18,000 tanks to NATO's 6,550,
NATO balances the threat with over
240,000 anti-tank weapons in
Europe. "The Warsaw Pact's advan
tage is largely a figment of the pub
lic's imagination," Gusterson said.
