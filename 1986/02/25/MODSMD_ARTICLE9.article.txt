There they go again.
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev have again begun lobbing ambitious, but hardly
realistic arms control "proposals" at one another. Over
the last two months, both the White House and the
Kremlin have each unilaterally presented arms control
packages designed less to further the cause of serious
arms reduction than to generate good public relations.
Such blatant use of the arms control issue as a politi
cal propaganda device cannot help but undermine the
already fragile credibility of arms control in the minds
of U.S. and Soviet citizens.
On Jan. 15, Gorbachev launched the first salvo of
1986. In a letter sent to Reagan, he issued a call for the
elimination of all nuclear weapons by the year 2000.
His proposal, outlined in stages, calls initially for a
"freeze" of tactical weapons on both sides. Because the
Soviets currently enjoy a numerical edge in the number
of tactical missiles, Gorbachev's plan would automati
cally give the Kremlin an advantage. By including such
a provision, Gorbachev insures a public relations vic
tory for himself because it virtually forces the United
States to reject his proposal.
Reagan responded in kind Sunday. He called
for the elimination of U.S. and Soviet medium
range missiles in Europe and Asia over the next three
years. Like Gorbachev's proposal to get rid of all nuc
lear weapons, Reagan's counterproposal sounds like a
noble gesture, but it is nevertheless useless as serious
arms control. According to figures from The New York
Times, the Soviets currently deploy 441 intermediate
range missiles to the United States' 108 missiles. An
immediate elimination of such weapons would force a
much greater Soviet sacrifice. Moscow's rejection of

Reagan's latest is virtually assured.
As U.S. citizens (and most likely those of the
Soviet Union as well) see such unrealistic and insincere
arms control proposals repeatedly splashed across the
front pages of their local newspapers, will they not
perhaps begin to question the ultimate feasibility of the
arms control process? Hollow declarations such as
those exchanged by the White House and the Kremlin
over the last few weeks deliver quick public relations
boosts to the politicians, but sadly they also tarnish the
image of serious arms control efforts.
The safety of the world depends on sincere arms
control. Efforts to verifiably limit and reduce the
growing arsenals of the world's superpowers are of the
utmost importance. History has shown that arms con
trol agreements are indeed possible; the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) treaty of 1972 limiting strategic de
fenses, for example, has endured nearly 14 years.
Sadly, history has also shown that arms control agree
ments can be extremely fragile. Public and congres
sional distrust of the Soviets and of arms control, for
example, doomed the SALT II treaty to defeat in the
Senate.
Arms control depends on a shared perception of sin
cere mutual committment to the task. If the American
public doubts the workability of arms control, it cannot
go far. Likewise, if the Soviets perceive U.S. proposals
to be little more than political grandstanding, serious
negotiations are hardly possible.
For the sake of world peace, both the United States
and the Soviet Union must stop tossing the issue of
arms control around like a political football and direct
their energies to forging specific, verifiable and lasting
reductions in nuclear arms.
