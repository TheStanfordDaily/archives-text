Campus Interviews: March 10,1986
Introducing a new joint venture combining the best of American and Japanese
VLSI technologies and methods. A venture with the fast-paced drive of a start-up, and
the strength of a $200 million committed investment from two world leaders in
advanced technology: RCA and Sharp.
We're building a team of the world's best IC professionals... and a full-robotic
process, one-micron, 6" wafer fab in the greater Portland/Vancouver area. Our charter
is to design and manufacture innovative CMOS Microprocessors, Memories, Digital
Signal Processors and Application Specific Integrated Circuits.
For grads with a BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering,
Physics, Chemistry, or Material Science, you can explore these areas:
Design Engineering Product/Test Process Engineering
Design advanced CMOS Engineering Con vert silicon slices to
VLSI integrated circuits Responsible for a specific functional semiconductors
for digital signal process- product line of memory, through photo-lithography,
ing applications, micro- telecom, microprocessor diffusion and ion
processors and memories. devices, exposure to all implantation.
facets of IC manufactur
ing design, process and
test engineering.
We're located in the greater Portland/Vancouver area. The area is rich in recrea
tion, cultural and cosmopolitan choices. We also enjoy some of the lowest housing and
living costs in the country.
East meets West and you can meet your future. If you are unable to meet with us
on campus, please send your resume to: Employment Manager, RCA /Sharp Micro
electronics, P.O. Box 1044, Dept. COL, Camas, Washington 98607.
