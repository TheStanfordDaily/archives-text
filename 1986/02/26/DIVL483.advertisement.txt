PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE SEMINAR
STRUCTURES OF MIND,
STRUCTURES OF MATTER:
SCIENTIFIC INTUITION AND THEORIES
THAT PREDICT THE WORLD
Jonathan Shear, Ph.D., Philosophy
Thursday, February 27,12:15 PM
Tresidder Union, Cyprus Room South
The process of generalizing from limited observations to statements which success
fully predict the future can be shown to depend on an innate ability to impose pat
terns and regularities on our conceptions of nature. It also implies a close connection
between structures underlying mental phenomena and those underlying physical
phenomena. This connection finds empirical support in parallels between deep
structures of mind described by ancient Greek and Asian meditation traditions and
those of matter described by quantum field theory. These parallels were first noted
by Heisenberg, Schroedinger, and other founders of quantum mechanics, and are
now supported by research into consciousness utilizing the techniques of the TM
program. These parallels and an hypothesis of the unity of nature together suggest a
resolution of the paradox of what Wigner and other physicists have often called the
"unreasonable effectiveness" of mathematics in the physical sciences.
