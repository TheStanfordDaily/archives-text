# Marcos resigns, flees; celebration in Manila
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff With wire reports 
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos left his palace
Monday night and fled the country yesterday as his 20-
vear-old regime crumbled only hours after the inaugura
tion of opposition leader Corazon Aquino as president.
"The long agony is over," said the 53-year-old Aquino,
the Philippines' first woman president. "We have
achieved our freedom with courage and determination
and, most important, in peace. A new life starts for our
country tomorrow, a life filled with hope and, I believe, a
life that will be blessed with peace and progress."

Marcos, 68, flew with his family and close aides in two
helicopters to a U.S. Air Force base 50 miles north of
Manila, just nine hours after he took an oath of office for
a new six-year term as president. U.S. officials said
Marcos landed at Clark Air Base, where he spent the
night, then left for the U.S.-administered Pacific island of
Guam.
He has been offered asylum in the United States, but
his ultimate destination is unknown.
At Stanford, community members differed in their
reactions to the latest events in and around Manila.
Speculating on Marcos' destination, History Prof. Peter
Duus said, "The ideal thing for the new government to do
would be to find him some nice island in the Philippines
and let him live in exile basically at home, under house ar

rest."
"I don't notice a great sense of recrimination among the
new leaders, and possibly some accommodation for
Marcos could be found," he said. "From the U.S. point of
view, that would be the best solution."
The United States promptly recognized the government
of Aquino, who was swept into power by a military mutiny
that began Saturday and drew a massive outpouring of
public support. In a statement, Secretary of State George
Shultz hailed Aquino and the Filipino people for a com
mitment to non-violence in working for a transition to a
new government following a Feb. 7 presidential election
marred by massive fraud and violence.
Regarding the U.S. support of Aquino's government,
Duus said, "It was sort of touch-and-go after the presi
dential election. Reagan's instincts were to work with
Marcos. But then the people in the State Department
realized that this was the beginning of the end. TTiere was
probably a high-level debate within the government, and
then common sense prevailed."
Some professors disagreed over whether the United
States should become involved in Philippine affairs.
"It will take a lot of wisdom and restraint to let Aquino
do what she's doing," said Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo, who said he is "concerned about American in
tervention."

quickly Washington will give them (the
Filipinos) military and economic support."
Aquino took her oath of office Monday in a
ceremony in which she was proclaimed presi
dent by opposition members of parliament
and Filipino dignitaries. The proceedings, in a
social and sports club in a Manila suburb,
took place amid tension between military
rebels supporting Aquino and troops backing
Marcos.
However, it became clear in the hours af

terward that Marcos had lost the support of
most of his remaining military commanders
and that his government was crippled by
defections of senior officials.
In her inauguration, Aquino rewarded Juan
Ponce Enrile, who had been Marcos' defense
minister for nearly two decades before the
mutiny, by naming him to the same post in her
new cabinet. She appointed Fidel Ramos, also
formerly in Marcos' cabinet, to armed forces
chief of staff and promoted him to full gen
eral. Aquino also named Salvador Laurel, her
vice president, as concurrent prime minister.
University scholars and students expressed
caution over the future of this new coalition.

"We have to remember that Aquino was at
odds with her vice president until the last min
ute, when they decided to run together,"
Myers said.
"The hiring (of Ramos and Enrile) was the
best that Aquino could do at the present
time," said Filipino student Ramon Abracosa.
"I suppose that there will be some power
struggles within the Aquino camp."
"Enrile was part of the big crony capital in
Marcos' camp," Abracosa said. "He
represents a lot of people who benefited from
Marcos' rule, and he'll probably assume a
protective role for those people."
Rosaldo expressed hope for the future of

Aquino's government, saying "I hope it'll
have staying power for the term of its elected
office — not another 20 years, but back to a
steady democratic process. And I think that's
very likely that this will happen."
Marcos, who suffers from a degenerative
disease that has affected his kidneys,
reportedly was carried aboard the U.S. Air
Force medical evacuation plane on a
stretcher.
Marcos was declared the victor in vote
counting by a parliament that he controlled,
but there was a widespread public perception
that Aquino had won.
In his inaugural address before an audience

of Cabinet ministers and aides and about 500
supporters in the palace ceremonial hall,
Marcos vowed, "We will overcome." He
pledged to "prevent the destruction of our
democratic society." To the end, he spoke of
filing charges against the mutineers and
Aquino supporters for "usurpation of public
authority" by rebelling against him.
Since the military rebellion began Saturday,
15 people have been reported killed and 20
wounded. But the death toll was considered
light in view of the potential for violence
raised by the military mutiny and confronta
tions between demonstrators and loyalist
troops.

quickly Washington will give them (the
Filipinos) military and economic support."
Aquino took her oath of office Monday in a
ceremony in which she was proclaimed presi
dent by opposition members of parliament
and Filipino dignitaries. The proceedings, in a
social and sports club in a Manila suburb,
took place amid tension between military
rebels supporting Aquino and troops backing
Marcos.
However, it became clear in the hours af

terward that Marcos had lost the support of
most of his remaining military commanders
and that his government was crippled by
defections of senior officials.
In her inauguration, Aquino rewarded Juan
Ponce Enrile, who had been Marcos' defense
minister for nearly two decades before the
mutiny, by naming him to the same post in her
new cabinet. She appointed Fidel Ramos, also
formerly in Marcos' cabinet, to armed forces
chief of staff and promoted him to full gen
eral. Aquino also named Salvador Laurel, her
vice president, as concurrent prime minister.
University scholars and students expressed
caution over the future of this new coalition.

"We have to remember that Aquino was at
odds with her vice president until the last min
ute, when they decided to run together,"
Myers said.
"The hiring (of Ramos and Enrile) was the
best that Aquino could do at the present
time," said Filipino student Ramon Abracosa.
"I suppose that there will be some power
struggles within the Aquino camp."
"Enrile was part of the big crony capital in
Marcos' camp," Abracosa said. "He
represents a lot of people who benefited from
Marcos' rule, and he'll probably assume a
protective role for those people."
Rosaldo expressed hope for the future of

Aquino's government, saying "I hope it'll
have staying power for the term of its elected
office — not another 20 years, but back to a
steady democratic process. And I think that's
very likely that this will happen."
Marcos, who suffers from a degenerative
disease that has affected his kidneys,
reportedly was carried aboard the U.S. Air
Force medical evacuation plane on a
stretcher.
Marcos was declared the victor in vote
counting by a parliament that he controlled,
but there was a widespread public perception
that Aquino had won.
In his inaugural address before an audience

of Cabinet ministers and aides and about 500
supporters in the palace ceremonial hall,
Marcos vowed, "We will overcome." He
pledged to "prevent the destruction of our
democratic society." To the end, he spoke of
filing charges against the mutineers and
Aquino supporters for "usurpation of public
authority" by rebelling against him.
Since the military rebellion began Saturday,
15 people have been reported killed and 20
wounded. But the death toll was considered
light in view of the potential for violence
raised by the military mutiny and confronta
tions between demonstrators and loyalist
troops.
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos left his palace
Monday night and fled the country yesterday as his 20-
vear-old regime crumbled only hours after the inaugura
tion of opposition leader Corazon Aquino as president.
"The long agony is over," said the 53-year-old Aquino,
the Philippines' first woman president. "We have
achieved our freedom with courage and determination
and, most important, in peace. A new life starts for our
country tomorrow, a life filled with hope and, I believe, a
life that will be blessed with peace and progress."

Marcos, 68, flew with his family and close aides in two
helicopters to a U.S. Air Force base 50 miles north of
Manila, just nine hours after he took an oath of office for
a new six-year term as president. U.S. officials said
Marcos landed at Clark Air Base, where he spent the
night, then left for the U.S.-administered Pacific island of
Guam.
He has been offered asylum in the United States, but
his ultimate destination is unknown.
At Stanford, community members differed in their
reactions to the latest events in and around Manila.
Speculating on Marcos' destination, History Prof. Peter
Duus said, "The ideal thing for the new government to do
would be to find him some nice island in the Philippines
and let him live in exile basically at home, under house ar

rest."
"I don't notice a great sense of recrimination among the
new leaders, and possibly some accommodation for
Marcos could be found," he said. "From the U.S. point of
view, that would be the best solution."
The United States promptly recognized the government
of Aquino, who was swept into power by a military mutiny
that began Saturday and drew a massive outpouring of
public support. In a statement, Secretary of State George
Shultz hailed Aquino and the Filipino people for a com
mitment to non-violence in working for a transition to a
new government following a Feb. 7 presidential election
marred by massive fraud and violence.
Regarding the U.S. support of Aquino's government,
Duus said, "It was sort of touch-and-go after the presi
dential election. Reagan's instincts were to work with
Marcos. But then the people in the State Department
realized that this was the beginning of the end. TTiere was
probably a high-level debate within the government, and
then common sense prevailed."
Some professors disagreed over whether the United
States should become involved in Philippine affairs.
"It will take a lot of wisdom and restraint to let Aquino
do what she's doing," said Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo, who said he is "concerned about American in
tervention."
