Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos left his palace
Monday night and fled the country yesterday as his 20-
vear-old regime crumbled only hours after the inaugura
tion of opposition leader Corazon Aquino as president.
"The long agony is over," said the 53-year-old Aquino,
the Philippines' first woman president. "We have
achieved our freedom with courage and determination
and, most important, in peace. A new life starts for our
country tomorrow, a life filled with hope and, I believe, a
life that will be blessed with peace and progress."

Marcos, 68, flew with his family and close aides in two
helicopters to a U.S. Air Force base 50 miles north of
Manila, just nine hours after he took an oath of office for
a new six-year term as president. U.S. officials said
Marcos landed at Clark Air Base, where he spent the
night, then left for the U.S.-administered Pacific island of
Guam.
He has been offered asylum in the United States, but
his ultimate destination is unknown.
At Stanford, community members differed in their
reactions to the latest events in and around Manila.
Speculating on Marcos' destination, History Prof. Peter
Duus said, "The ideal thing for the new government to do
would be to find him some nice island in the Philippines
and let him live in exile basically at home, under house ar

rest."
"I don't notice a great sense of recrimination among the
new leaders, and possibly some accommodation for
Marcos could be found," he said. "From the U.S. point of
view, that would be the best solution."
The United States promptly recognized the government
of Aquino, who was swept into power by a military mutiny
that began Saturday and drew a massive outpouring of
public support. In a statement, Secretary of State George
Shultz hailed Aquino and the Filipino people for a com
mitment to non-violence in working for a transition to a
new government following a Feb. 7 presidential election
marred by massive fraud and violence.
Regarding the U.S. support of Aquino's government,
Duus said, "It was sort of touch-and-go after the presi
dential election. Reagan's instincts were to work with
Marcos. But then the people in the State Department
realized that this was the beginning of the end. TTiere was
probably a high-level debate within the government, and
then common sense prevailed."
Some professors disagreed over whether the United
States should become involved in Philippine affairs.
"It will take a lot of wisdom and restraint to let Aquino
do what she's doing," said Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo, who said he is "concerned about American in
tervention."
Hoover Senior Research Fellow Ramon Myers advoca
ted U.S. involvement in the Philippines, saying, "It's a
golden time for us to exercise a modernizing influence."
Myers said stability in the Philippines "depends on how
