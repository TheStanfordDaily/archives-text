Thanks to a new grant program,
students with artistic or literary tal
ents will be able to apply for research
funding that used to be available only
to students in the sciences, according
to Laura Selznick, director of the Un
dergraduate Research Opportunity
office (URO).
The Robert M. Golden Major
Grants for Humanities Scholarship
and Artistic Creation will offer up to
$2,500 to 10 undergraduates. In ad
dition to the grants, Golden medals
for excellence in the humanities and
the creative arts will be presented

each year to graduating seniors who
have produced the most creative and
outstanding work in the humanities
or in the arts.
"There are not that many
(research) opportunities for
humanities students," Selznick said.
"This culture seems to reward more
science-oriented programs and this
(Golden program) is a real encour
agement for students pursuing the
humanities and the arts."
The Golden grants are designed to
support student work in a broad vari
ety of directions, such as creative
writing, works of art and scholarship
on literary topics.

Asst. History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, associate dean ot
Humanities and Sciences and initiator
of the grant program, said the Golden
grants will "give the study of
humanities and arts at Stanford the
boost which they (the departments)
need."
"I hope that (the grant program)
will attract more students to doing
honors work in the humanities and
arts," said Lougee, who was recently
named dean of undergraduate
studies.
Only 10 percent of undergraduates
participate in research programs,
Lougee said, adding that the number

is "too low."
The Golden grant and medal pro
gram was made possible by Stanford
benefactor Robert Golden, A.B. '41,
of San Diego.
Students applying for Golden
grants must devote three quarters'
time toward development or research
in their individual areas. Grants for
summer research, which must be con
nected to work during the normal
university session, will also be
awarded to permit students to pursue
full-time independent work on their
In addition to the grant the student
receives, a $1,000 professional ex-

pense account will be given to the fac
ulty sponsor of each winning Golden
grant project.
Selznick stressed the importance of
the faculty role, "Students who are
doing the independent work need to
have the perspective of someone who
has done research before. It's another
level of academic experience for a
student."
Applications for the first round of
Golden grants will be due April 7 in
the URO program office, located in
590-A Old Union.
An informational meeting is sched
uled for grant applicants on March 3,
from 12-1 p.m. in Ceras 204.
