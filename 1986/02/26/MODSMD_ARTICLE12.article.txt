## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Monitor police conduct 
### 
The ASSU recently recommended the establishment
of a Stanford Police Review Commission (SPRC), a
proposal that deserves our respect and support.
Excessive force demonstrated by Stanford police of
ficers toward the apartheid protesters arrested at the
Old Union sit-ins in October and the alleged harass
ment of minority groups by the officers offer two ex
amples highlighting the need for a formal commission
to monitor police actions.
Currently, there is no organization on campus
dealing specifically with complaints against the police.
Individuals could bring their grievances to the om
budsperson, but that office lacks the time or resources
necessary to investigate thoroughly complaints against
the police.
Aggrieved parties could pursue the matter with the
Stanford police themselves. Yet the diligence with
which the police would probe their own conduct
remains a serious concern.
The SPRC would provide the Stanford community
with a viable and accessible body to examine instances
of alleged police misconduct.
And since students, faculty, workers and administra
tion would be equally represented, the commission

could go a long way toward achieving a balanced view
point.
As proposed, the commission will gather evidence
on charges of police misuse of authority and obtain tes
timony from the involved parties. Since the University
does not own the Stanford Police Department, the
SPRC cannot enforce any disciplinary action. However,
it will be able to publish its findings and make recom
mendations to the University, police and Faculty Sen
ate.
If the University does not endorse the establishment
of the SPRC, the ASSU will attempt to place a special
fee request on the spring election ballot to set up an in
dependent review commission. However, such a body
would remain relatively powerless and as such would
have a limited effect in discouraging police misconduct.
University support of the SPRC would lend the com
mission the authority necessary to render decisions de
manding the appropriate respect and consideration.
In the past, University President Donald Kennedy
has said he does not feel there is a need for a police
review commission. We feel there is and call on Ken
nedy and the University to support the SPRC.
