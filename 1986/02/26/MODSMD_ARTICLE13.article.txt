## Pretoria's bullying saps Lesotho 
### 
For its defiance of the apartheid regime in neighboring
South Africa, the government of the tiny nation of
Lesotho was toppled Jan. 20 in a military coup. South
Africa has brought down the leader it accused of "aiming
to turn Lesotho into the Cuba of Southern Africa"
(Lesotho's military budget is less than one one-hundredth
of South Africa's). Pretoria's aggression against Lesotho
reaffirms once again that the apartheid regime, which
spends over $1 million each day waging war in Namibia
and Angola, is the main source of violence and instability
in southern Africa.

The coup in Lesotho was the culmination of several
years of South African economic blackmail, destabiliza
tion and direct military attacks. Since Jan. 1, Pretoria had
imposed a tight economic blockade on Lesotho, which is
totally surrounded by South African territory. The border
closures blocked the importation of food, medicines and
other necessities, enforcing further starvation and
hardship for the country's 1.4 million people.
Just three days after meeting with South African offi
cials in Cape Town, Gen. Justin Lakhanya announced in
an early morning radio broadcast that Prime Minister
Leabua Jonathan had been deposed and that he
(Lakhanya) was heading a new governing military council.
The removal of Jonathan as prime minister was obviously
an explicit condition for the lifting of the economic block
ade on Lesotho.
During his first decade in power, Jonathan was viewed
as a hand-picked apartheid collaborator. Britain and
South Africa were largely responsible for securing his rise
to power when Basutoland was moved toward indepen
dence, becoming Lesotho in 1966. In 1970 South Africa
helped Jonathan remain in power by declaring a state of
emergency in order to avert electoral defeat. Relations
became increasingly antagonistic in his second decade in
power as Jonathan realized that South Africa "wants
Lesotho as another Bantustan and the inception of a gov
ernment which is a mere appendage of Pretoria."
Since 1976, when Lesotho refused to recognize
Transkei, the first South African "homeland" to be
granted "independence," South Africa has turned the
screws on the country. Following the 1976 township
revolts within South Africa, thousands fled into Lesotho
to escape South Africa's brutal police repression. Under
the impact of the advancing liberation struggle in southern
Africa, Jonathan's government granted South African
refugees, including members of the African National
Congress (ANC), political asylum. But the people of
Lesotho (the Besotho) were made to suffer: in December
1982 the South African Defense Force dropped bombs on
Lesotho's capital, Maseru, killing 42 people.
In recent years, Jonathan had sought to lessen
Lesotho's dependence on South Africa by strengthening
ties with Mozambique and the other states neighboring
South Africa. In the early 1980s, diplomatic relations
were established with the Soviet Union, North Korea, and
China in an affort to assert political sovereignty. With
revolution formenting within its own borders, Pretoria

supported another terrorist attack on Maseru in Decem
ber 1985, killing nine people. Jonathan once again took
his protest ot the United Nations, and Pretoria responded
with a border blockade of such severity that it resulted in
his demise.
Like Jonathan, Lakhanya comes to power with a policy
orientation aimed at the impossible: peaceful coexistence
with Pretoria. In his first policy statement on Jan. 23, Lak
hanya announced his desire to cooperate with Pretoria on
security issues and more concretely to expel all ANC
members from Lesotho as soon as possible. Pretoria has
responded by easing up the border strangulation of
Lesotho, enabling traffic to pass across their common bor
der so that life can drag on. So that Basotho men can leave
their families in order to earn a migrant worker's wage in
South Africa. So that Basotho women can be left alone to
scrape in hopes of supplementing their husbands' wage so
that they can care for the elderly and the children.
Lesotho is the country most vulnerable to the potential
effects of disinvestment from South Africa as 70 percent
of its income derives from the remittances sent home by

migrant workers and from the customs tariffs on trade
through South Africa. Yet do not be surprised when the
conservative Gen. Lakhanya becomes radicalized as did
Johnathan. Inevitably, he will join the leader of every
other southern African state in favoring economic disen
gangement from the apartheid regime.
Lesotho was once a flourishing agricultural society
which exported grain and maize in the 19th and earth
20th century before colonial policies transformed it into a
labor reserve for the mines of South Africa. The over
throw of the Lesotho government is a major blow to the
people of Lesotho. Yet while the Basotho must struggle
for survival, they also strive for change.
