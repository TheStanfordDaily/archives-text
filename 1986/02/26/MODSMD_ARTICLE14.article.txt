blame misplaced
Let me disabuse the reading public
of several errors printed in Daily arti
cles in recent weeks concerning Com
mencement speaker deliberations.
First. The Daily misrepresented
both the figures and intent of the sur
vey poll the Senior Class Presidents
(SCP) conducted as part of the
speaker selection process. Contrary
to Daily reports that fewer than 100
seniors participated, about 250 stu
dents in fact responded to the ques
tionnaire.
That The Daily speciously implied
the turnout is not statistically reliable
as representative of senior opinion in
general is not even my main objection
to this inaccuracy. The fact that The
Daily misconstrued the purpose of
the poll is most unsettling. The poll
was not intended as a ballot to elect a
graduation speaker and a rank list of
alternates as The Daily suggested, but

rather served as a survey account of
senior preferences in the matter. In
fact, the poll represents the first time
any SCP slate endeavored to tap
senior opinion in an official way
beyond strictly subjective analysis.
The results of the poll, though not
binding, aided the SCP in recom
mending speaker candidates to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy,
with whom the ultimate power of
decision rests.
Second, graduate speaker informa
tion was not intended for public con
sumption as The Daily wrongly in
ferred. Were it not for an unauthor
ized disclosure of privileged infor
mation by the Gorbachev petition or
ganizers, the Gorbachev invitation
and Cosby candidacy would never
have received public attention. And if
The Daily had not meddled in SCP
private business and alerted
prospective candidates on its own ini
tiative in advance of University con
tact, the who's next issue never would
have been raised, much less
publicized.

Undue publicity did result,
however, with The Daily as the
greatest contributor churning out no
less than five news articles and two
editorials on the issue. Of course, The
Daily's prerogative to print is not
being challenged here. But the ethics
of extracting sensitive information in
this case can be challenged when it
stands in obvious contradiction to
The Daily's own professed view that
"(speaker) negotiations ought to be
removed from the public eye." It is
sadly ironic that The Daily should
from on high scold the SCP for allow
ing such publicity when it is the very
author of the "snafus."

Grassy hills
not natural here
The caption to the front page
picture of your Feb. 21 issue was

"Showing that technology and nature
can live in harmony, this cow lounges
comfortably near the Dish." Setting
aside the questions of whether the
cow in question is actually a steer and
whether cattle can be said to lounge,
I'd like to complain that that's not na
ture, it's agriculture. Grassland
studded with a few mature oaks is not
the natural vegetation of this area. In
a natural state what we would have
here would be woodland or chapar
ral. By eating and trampling the seed
lings of native plants, cattle perpetu
ate the grassy landscape. New great
oaks from little acorns don't get to
grow. When those oaks die, there will
be plain grassland.
Nature as it occurs in this area is
unpopular because it isn't suitable for
cows and because every now and then
it catches fire a little. I thought it was
a nice picture. I just thought you
might like to know what it's a picture
of.
