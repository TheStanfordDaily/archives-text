# Budget cuts imperil legal aid
## 
### 
Earlier this month, President Reagan annnounced his
1987 budget proposals. As he has every year since he has
been president, he proposes to eliminate completely the
Legal Services Corporation (LSC). The LSC provides le
gal assistance to people below the poverty line, who
otherwise would be entirely without access to the legal
system. Unlike previous years, this time Reagan may be
successful in his drive to end legal aid to the poor.
It may be that the Legal Services Corporation is a crea
ture only a law student could love. For the desperate in
our society, food, shelter, education and jobs rank high on
the day-to-day list of priorities above being able to get a
lawyer. However, access to justice is part of what makes
us civilized. Our much-vaunted rights and freedoms don't
mean very much for people who have no way of asserting
them.

Legal aid is more important than it may seem at first
blush. A dispute with a landlord that would be an incon
venience for most Stanford students can be a catastrophe
for a family with no savings and no parents to bail them
o,ut. Divorce and child-custody disputes, sad facts of our
society, can become unmanageable nightmares without
the help of a lawyer through the legal system. Perhaps
most importantly, legal aid can secure the state and
federal benefit payments which many low-income people
need to survive. Aggressive budget-cutting in recent years
has meant that thousands of destitute individuals have er
roneously been kicked out of benefit programs. Without
legal help to regain the money which is their legal right,
many poor people would have to do without food and
shelter. (The Constitution guarantees the right to an at
torney in criminal cases; these lawyers are provided not by
the LSC, but by another agency.)
The Legal Services Corporation has already endured
dramatic cuts. In the past five years, the LSC's real
budget, after inflation, has declined by over a third. Even
this understates the decline; more people are below the
poverty line now than were before Reagan, so the LSC's
workload has increased. (By contrast, Reagan asks for a
77 percent increase in Star Wars spending this year alone.
Since 1980, agricultural subsidies have increased over 800
percent.) The Administration has subverted the program
in other ways as well, for instance appointing to the LSC's
board of directors congressional aides who have led the
fight to abolish the agency.
The Administration offers ttfo justifications for

abolishing legal services. One, it says, is that the increas
ing number of lawyers in our society should bring legal
fees down, and make it easier to get lawyers. This may
prove true for some sectors of society, but (not surpris
ingly) it completely misunderstands the plight of the truly
needy. Someone who's just had their disability payments
taken away and is about to be evicted just doesn't have
extra money to be paying for lawyers. The amount of
money that makes the difference between barely scraping
by and starving just isn't large enough to interest a private
attorney. Even if it were, a starving person can't afford to
share the proceeds of a suit with a lawyer.
Second, the Reagan Administration calculates that, if
every private attorney in the country just donated an extra
20 hours a year to working for the poor, this would com
pletely eliminate the need for federal legal services. This
point is more callous still. It is already true that privately
funded and privately staffed legal aid clinics are doing a
large portion of the poverty law work needed in this
country. Indeed, the East Palo Alto Community Law
Project, started and staffed by Stanford students, is an
outstandingly successful example of such a private clinic.
But Reagan does not forecast that it is likely that private
lawyers will pick up all of the need left if the LSC were
abolished. In fact, the Administration knows that most of
the need would not be met, and that is the way they want
it.
Reagan has opposed legal services for the pooT ever
since he was governor of California. Then, his big grower
supporters were upset because legal services helped farm
workers assert their rights. Manufacturers don't like legal
aid because it helps consumers recover money for defec
tive products. These interests don't have the strength to
repeal people's rights; as a result, they have been trying to
nullify these rights by choking off access to the legal sys
tem.
Our legal system is in deep trouble. For many people, it
is too complex to use without a lawyer, and it is too expen
sive to use with a lawyer. Our society cannot view itself as
fair when, like slave states before the Civil War, an entire
class of people is effectively denied the right to use the
courts. Even people who plan never to be poor should be
worried about a system of government that denies the
protection of law to a large segment of society. The Legal
Services Corporation is only a stopgap, but it is important
beyond its cost.
Reagan has always failed in his attempts to abolish the
LSC, but this year it may be different. The Gramm-
Rudman balanced budget act has placed heavy pressure
on all non-military spending. Indeed, after Reagan's
budget was announced, Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) — the
far-right force behind the deficit bill — gleefully an
nounced that this year, he thought Legal Services was fi
nally dead. If he is right, the quality of justice in this
country will be diminished for all of us.
