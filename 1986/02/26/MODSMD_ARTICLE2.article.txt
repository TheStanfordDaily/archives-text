# ASSU sanctions refugee sanctuary
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night passed a resolution
declaring Stanford a sanctuary for Central Ameri
can refugees, endorsed an invitation to Soviet dissi
dent Andrei Sakharov to speak at Stanford, and
made recommendations for funding of student
groups.
Sanctuary at Stanford (SAS), a student group re
sponsible for organizing Stanford's sanctuary activr
ities, plans to hold a special election spring quarter
that it says will determine Stanford's status as a
sanctuary for Central American refugees.
SAS member Mike Tarpey said he is "happy that
there is a lot of support from the senate in such an
urgent situation." He said the sanctuary movement
will concentrate on "material aid" to refugees in
the area.
According to the resolution, which was written
by Undergraduate Senator Joel Bellenson, Sanctu
ary at Stanford will arrange for students to offer vol
untary services at established refugee social service
programs, raise bail monies for imprisoned
refugees, gather food and clothing for distribution
in the refugee community and arrange for refugees

to speak to Stanford classes. The group will also
tutor children in English and house refugees tem
porarily.
The senate also voted to endorse an invitation to
Sakharov, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist,
to speak at Stanford during Commencement week
in June. Members of the Stanford Committee for
Dr. Sakharov's Visit (SCSV) composed the letter
inviting Sakharov "to address the Stanford com
munity on the subject of world peace."
Sakharov, an outspoken hutnap rights activist,
was exiled to Gorky in 1980 for "anti-Soviet activi
ties." His wife, Dr. Yelena Bonner, is expected to
pay an informal visit to Stanford on Friday.
Sakharov "is informative and has some amazing
concepts of peace," according to Graduate Senator
Richard Beigel.
In other business, the senate voted not to place
funding requests from Women Defending Our
selves and The Stanford Quad on the special fee
ballot in the spring elections. Arguing that The
Quad should not be eligible for a special fee be
cause it does not serve a wide portion of the student
body, Graduate Senator Eric Berg stressed that
"only a limited number of people will buy a year
book."

Undergraduate Senator Jeff Soukup pointed out
that the senate's decision "is not impeding The
Quad from getting on the ballot," since a petition
with 10 percent of Stanford graduate and under
graduate students' signatures will placed the
group's fee request on the ballot.
The senate voted in favor of placing fee requests
from the Boathouse Party Area and the Party Fund
on the ballot. Formerly the ASSU Boathouse Party
Area, the present Boathouse is a student organiza
tion independent of Stanford's student govern
ment. With £ senate recommendation asking stu
dents to vote "yes," the Boathouse will have a spe
cial fee request of $25,833 for the construction and
operation of a party area at the Lake Lagunita
boathouse.
Declaring Stanford Outdoor Adventures and
Recreation group (SOAR) a charter organization,
the senate voted 17-1 to deny SOAR's special fee
request.
Senators in favor of the ASSU's decision raised
objections to Tresidder Union's involvement with
SOAR. According to Graduate Senator Jim
DeLaHunt, the Tresidder manager "appoints
SOAR's paid people and (has) the power of execu
tive veto over SOAR's decisions."
