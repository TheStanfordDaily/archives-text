## Group hopes seeds of peace will blossom on the Farm 
### ANDREA ARNOLD 
The United Nations has declared
1986 to be the International Year
of Peace. To many, this may sound
trivial, or even funny. One group
on campus is trying to destroy this
image that peace is merely a radi
cal, unattainable goal: Peace Edu
cation at Stanford (PEAS).
Senior Lisa Jacobson, the coord
inator of PEAS since the fall, said,
"We want to show everybody that
this is a very legitimate group, that
we have practical, concrete
guidelines for all types of people,
that we think peace in the world is a
workable goal if we are willing to
commit time to the problem."
Senior Vanessa Poster first

founded the group in spring 1984 in
the hopes of increasing student
awareness of peace issues. Poster
first generated interest by publish
ing a newsletter distributed among
students regularly.
"PEAS sees its role as trying to
generate interest among students,"
she said. "We are trying to get rid
of that 'work, study, get rich' ethic
at Stanford, and change it to 'work,
study, make a better, peaceful
world.' "
Jacobson pointed out that Stan
ford is behind other universities in
the peace studies area. For exam
ple, UC-Berkeley has recently
graduated its first two students
from a program called Peace and
Conflict Studies. There has been

some effort toward an effective
peace studies program at Stanford
since the days of the first president,
David Starr Jordan. A peace ac
tivist, Jordan envisioned a peace
studies program at Stanford.
A group of Stanford faculty
revived this movement in the
19605, but with limited success.
There is now a peace studies course
offered each winter quarter, but
PEAS wants more than just a class:
they feel that a peace studies major
would do more to promote peace.
The major that PEAS is trying to
organize would include classes from
already existing departments.
PEAS is selecting a curricula from
departments such as political sci
ence, history, psychology, econom
ics, philosophy and others that in
volve classes that relate to peace
studies issues.
The courses that PEAS is select
ing focus on peace studies within
several different disciplines. The
peace studies major would not be
geared toward any particular
"type" of person, since it will be
divided into several different
categories; people may approach it
from a feminist, religious, political
or other type of viewpoint.
Jacobson noted that a peace
studies major would give students
the opportunity to use "their life
and studies to contribute to some
thing greater than (themselves)."
To gather more supporters,
PEAS will be putting on a display
in Meyer Library March 3-28. The
display will illustrate the history of
peace studies at Stanford, as well as
PEAS' statement of purpose,
courses that would be offered in a
peace studies major, a list of the
programs offered at other univer
sities and information on how to
join and who to contact. PEAS
fliers will also be available.
Any students who would like
more information on the PEAS
program can contact Jacobson at
