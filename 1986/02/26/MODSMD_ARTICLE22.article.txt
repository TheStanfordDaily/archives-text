# Claw's color is questionable
## 
### DINESH VAZIRANI 
The Claw, that abstract architec
tural wonder in the middle of the pool
in White Plaza, has undergone a
transformation recently. It is no
longer black. Instead, it has a kind of
violet purple hue.
What do Stanford students think of
the Claw's new look? Well, there
doesn't seem to be a consensus; in
fact, students interviewed in this
highly scientific poll were split right
down the middle as to its relative
merits, or lack thereof.
"It made me laugh. It looks much
better black. I think (the paint is)
wearing off or something. It reminds
me of a bunch of felt grapes I made
once."
— Patty Stokes, co-terminal stu
dent
"No, I don't like it. It looks like it's
out of a cartoon. It was more of a
traditional fountain when it was
black."
— Mike Hawley, senior
"I like the new look. Purple is a
nice different color. It's more
'springy' — you know, that bouncy
spring feeling."
— Byron Han, graduate student
"Oh God. It's exactly the color it
shouldn't be."
— Ron Wolf, senior
"I like it because it's purple.
Reminds me of 'The Color Purple' by
Alice Walker. The book, not the
movie."
— John Rogers, graduate student
"Yes, I like the new purple look.
Purple is an original color. Doesn't
look like a piece of trash that was
thrown down in the middle of the
fountain anymore. Black is no
color. . . . Purple has identity."
— Douglas Baer, graduate student
"We love the new color of the
Claw. In fact, we think the University
should become the Stanford Violet
instead of the Stanford Cardinal.
Violet is such a pretty color."
— The Minnesota Vikings
"I can definitely dig the Claw's new
color, man. 1 mean, if I were alive."
— Jimi Hendrix, erstwhile purple
