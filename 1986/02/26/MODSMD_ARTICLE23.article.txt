## Prof, 's brain theory could explain the inexplicable 
### ROBIN M. DENNINGS 
Many Stanford students know Karl
Pribram the professor, a psychologist
who, in addition to teaching Psych
108 and 208, is a skilled neurosur
geon who conducts research on the
visual cortex of cats. Many people
outside the community, however, as
sociate Pribram primarily as a foun
der of the holonomic theory, a model
of brain behavior that has profound
implications for many areas of sci
ence.
The implications of the holonomic
theory for neuroscience, physics and
other areas have inspired symposiums
and books, such as "The Holograph-

If the theory is correct it
would be able to provide a
scientific explanation for
certain paranormal
phenomena as well as the
practices of esoteric Eastern
religions.

ic Paradigm." If the theory is correct
it would be able to provide a scientific
explanation for certain paranormal
phenomena as well as the practices of
esoteric Eastern religions.
The theory itself attempts to ac
count for observations of the brain's
function. The theory is very similar to
the optical holograph. However,
there are differences; thus, the
coining of the word holonome.
According to Pribram, "The brain

is a hologram in a holographic uni
verse." Specifically, the hologram is a
device that focuses two beams of laser
light on a sheet of film. One beam is a
reference reflected off of the object
to be photographed. The two beams
of light converge on the film to
produce an interference pattern. (An
illustration of interference patterns is
produced when concentric circles are
produced by two stones thrown into a
pond. The points where the circles in
teract are known as interference pat
terns.) In short, as Pribram noted in a
Psych 108 lecture, "Holograms are
created by taking pictures of inter
ference patterns."
The finished hologram has some

amazing properties. First of all, when
a laser is shown through the film
again, a three-dimensional represen
tation of the object is produced. In
addition the film can be broken up
into many pieces; yet, no matter how
small the pieces are, each is still
encoded with the information neces
sary to reproduce a three
dimensional portrayal of the object.
The hologram would not be possi
ble without the Fourier transform —

a discovery of Dennis Gabor that
later earned him a Nobel prize. As
Pribram recalls, "Gabor discovered
that any pattern, no matter how com
plex, can be resolved into a set of
simple wave forms that differ only in
terms of amplitude, frequency and
phase."
Because of this the hologram can
convert information into simple wave
forms and also reverse the process to
get the information again. Or as
Pribram describes it,"The Fourier
transform is invertable. Mathemati
cally, no information is lost during the
transform. Therefore, tremendous
amounts of information can be stored
on holographic film. For example,
one cubic centimeter can store one
billion decabytes of information." (A
decabyte contains 10 bytes). The
checkout counters at many super
markets now use a holographic
storage and retrieval system to speed
up their check-out lines.
Because of the capabilities of the
hologram, Pribram speculates that
dentrites (parts of brain cells) enable
the brain to operate as a hologram
performing Fourier transforms:
"Every neuron before it ends splits
into the fine branches of the dentritic
network. Everything occurs in these
branches simultaneously. Thus, when
a nerve impulse hits the end of the
dentrites it produces a wavefront.
Wavefronts from different dentrite
endings combine into interference
patterns."
Such a theory does indeed explain
how the brain can store large
amounts of information and retrieve
it almost instantaneously. It also ex
plains how large sections of the brain
can be injured; yet, like a hologram
most of the information is retained in
the functional remainder of the brain.
However, others have gone even fur
ther and used Pribram's theories to
provide a link between science and
the supernatural.
Pribram has also speculated about
two domains of reality which are very
intertwined: the perceived domain
and the potential domain (or domain
of frequencies). In this dualistic
world, the brain operates as the

hologram transforming the frequency
domain into the perceived domain. In
the perceived domain everything is
described in terms of space and time,
but in the potential domain every
thing has the capability of "being"
apart from space and time, which are
then "enfolded" and do not exist.
From these speculations others
theorize about many far reaching im
plications involving paranormal
events and other unexplainable

phenomena. Scientists have searched
for years to find the energy respon
sible for E.S.P., telepathy, healing,
psychokinesis, etc. However, if these
phenomena emerge from the fre
quency domain, they are not bound
by time and space and like the fre
quency domain they are potentially
everywhere at everytime. Directly
accessing the frequency domain could
explain the peace or euphoria ob
tained from either physical activities

such as running or from the practices
of certain religions.
When asked what he thought of
those who expanded his theories,
Pribram admits, "I can't say they're
wrong. . . . It's very similar to esoteric
philosophies." At the same time
Pribram also said he thinks someday
there will be a link-up between sci
ence and the paranormal, but
stressed, "I'm just concerned with the
way the brain works."

When asked what he thought of
those who expanded his theories,
Pribram admits, "I can't say they're
wrong. . . . It's very similar to esoteric
philosophies." At the same time
Pribram also said he thinks someday
there will be a link-up between sci

stressed, "I'm just concerned with the
way the brain works."

Many Stanford students know Karl
Pribram the professor, a psychologist
who, in addition to teaching Psych
108 and 208, is a skilled neurosur
geon who conducts research on the
visual cortex of cats. Many people
outside the community, however, as
sociate Pribram primarily as a foun
der of the holonomic theory, a model
of brain behavior that has profound
implications for many areas of sci
ence.
The implications of the holonomic
theory for neuroscience, physics and
other areas have inspired symposiums
and books, such as "The Holograph-

ic Paradigm." If the theory is correct
it would be able to provide a scientific
explanation for certain paranormal
phenomena as well as the practices of
esoteric Eastern religions.
The theory itself attempts to ac
count for observations of the brain's
function. The theory is very similar to
the optical holograph. However,
there are differences; thus, the
coining of the word holonome.
According to Pribram, "The brain

is a hologram in a holographic uni
verse." Specifically, the hologram is a
device that focuses two beams of laser
light on a sheet of film. One beam is a
reference reflected off of the object
to be photographed. The two beams
of light converge on the film to
produce an interference pattern. (An
illustration of interference patterns is
produced when concentric circles are
produced by two stones thrown into a
pond. The points where the circles in
teract are known as interference pat
terns.) In short, as Pribram noted in a
Psych 108 lecture, "Holograms are
created by taking pictures of inter
ference patterns."
The finished hologram has some

amazing properties. First of all, when
a laser is shown through the film
again, a three-dimensional represen
tation of the object is produced. In
addition the film can be broken up
into many pieces; yet, no matter how
small the pieces are, each is still
encoded with the information neces
sary to reproduce a three
dimensional portrayal of the object.
The hologram would not be possi
ble without the Fourier transform —

a discovery of Dennis Gabor that
later earned him a Nobel prize. As
Pribram recalls, "Gabor discovered
that any pattern, no matter how com
plex, can be resolved into a set of
simple wave forms that differ only in
terms of amplitude, frequency and
phase."
Because of this the hologram can
convert information into simple wave
forms and also reverse the process to
get the information again. Or as
Pribram describes it,"The Fourier
transform is invertable. Mathemati
cally, no information is lost during the
transform. Therefore, tremendous
amounts of information can be stored
on holographic film. For example,
one cubic centimeter can store one
billion decabytes of information." (A
decabyte contains 10 bytes). The
checkout counters at many super
markets now use a holographic
storage and retrieval system to speed
up their check-out lines.
Because of the capabilities of the
hologram, Pribram speculates that
dentrites (parts of brain cells) enable
the brain to operate as a hologram
performing Fourier transforms:
"Every neuron before it ends splits
into the fine branches of the dentritic
network. Everything occurs in these
branches simultaneously. Thus, when
a nerve impulse hits the end of the
dentrites it produces a wavefront.
Wavefronts from different dentrite
endings combine into interference
patterns."
Such a theory does indeed explain
how the brain can store large
amounts of information and retrieve
it almost instantaneously. It also ex
plains how large sections of the brain
can be injured; yet, like a hologram
most of the information is retained in
the functional remainder of the brain.
However, others have gone even fur
ther and used Pribram's theories to
provide a link between science and
the supernatural.
Pribram has also speculated about
two domains of reality which are very
intertwined: the perceived domain
and the potential domain (or domain
of frequencies). In this dualistic
world, the brain operates as the

hologram transforming the frequency
domain into the perceived domain. In
the perceived domain everything is
described in terms of space and time,
but in the potential domain every
thing has the capability of "being"
apart from space and time, which are
then "enfolded" and do not exist.
From these speculations others
theorize about many far reaching im
plications involving paranormal
events and other unexplainable

phenomena. Scientists have searched
for years to find the energy respon
sible for E.S.P., telepathy, healing,
psychokinesis, etc. However, if these
phenomena emerge from the fre
quency domain, they are not bound
by time and space and like the fre
quency domain they are potentially
everywhere at everytime. Directly
accessing the frequency domain could

tained from either physical activities
