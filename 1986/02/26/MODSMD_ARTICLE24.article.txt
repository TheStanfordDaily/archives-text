# Scholar discusses controversy over human ancestor finds
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
The study of human evolutionary origins is a story of
both consensus and controversy, according to Donald
Johanson, a Stanford anthropology professor who works
with Berkeley's Institute of Human Origins.
Ever since the early 19th century, when the first fossils
of human ancestors were identified, the study of human
beginnings has been punctuated by dramatic, often emo
tional controversies over the validity of proposed theories
or the significance of fossil finds, Johanson said.
Currently one of the foremost figures in the field of
human evolution, Johanson is perhaps best known for his
discovery of Lucy, the famous, near-complete fossil
skeleton of a small human ancestor that stalked the plains
of Africa more than three million years ago. Johanson dis
cussed the current status of the controversy over Lucy and
defended his work in a speech to the Winter Colloquium
on Population Studies here Feb. 19.
The current debate raging in human evolutionary
circles centers on whether the species Lucy belonged to
(named Australopithecus afarensis by Johanson) was a
direct human ancestor or an offshoot that continued to
evolve but eventually died out. There is also some discus
sion as to whether A. afarensis was even a distinct species
— some anthropologists feel it was only an early form of
the species Australopithecus africanus.
Johanson said these questions have been raised because
"we are often faced with a discontinuous and fragmentary
fossil record." In this situation, "people have various in
terpretations about what the fossils we do have do mean."

Part of this problem is one of definition — determining
what exactly constitutes a species.
There are currently two basic schools of thought about
A. afarensis. One school, proposed originally by Johanson
and others in a 1979 issue of Science magazine, puts
afarensis at a point where the human family tree diverged:
one branch went on to produce the genus Homo and
eventually man, while the other evolved first into
A.africanus and then into a larger, heavier relative,
Australopithecus robustus, which eventually died out. The
second school of thought, championed by Richard
Leakey, son of famed anthropologist Louis Leakey, holds
that the genuses Australopithecus and Homo were entirely
separate lines, with A. afarensis being the ancestor of later
Australopithecines but not of Homo. An as yet unknown
hominid (man-like being) would then presumably provide
the ancestry of the genus Homo.
A third, less well-known theory proposes a two
branched tree with the split occurring at A. africanus
(later than afarensis), but Johanson discounted this as not
fitting the evidence.
Johanson described A. afarensis as a "generalized,
primitive hominid" with an ape-like skull — a small brain
but large face — and upright posture. This showed what
he called "mosaic evolution"— when different anatomical
systems are evolutionarily selected for at different speeds.
Homo habilis and Homo erectus, more recent ancestors of
man, then went on after afarensis to develop large brains.
When arguing against A. afarensis as a direct human an
cestor, people try to fit the evidence to their preconceived
ideas, Johanson said. For example, scientist Jack Stern
and others have proposed that A. afarensis was arboreal,
or tree-dwelling, because its arm sockets tended to point

up, implying that the arms were usually held overhead in
order to swing from branches. This would make the crea
ture an unlikely candidate for direct human ancestry.
Johanson then refuted this by pointing out that there is
a great deal of variation in arm sockets (and other similar
traits) in humans even now, and added that it is difficult to
generalize from the few afarensis shoulders that have been
found. He also described how the afarensis big toe did not
diverge from the other toes and that none of them could
grasp very well. This is a big argument for bipedalism
(walking upright) in the creature, he said. To clinch this
Johanson then showed a photo of fossil, obviously bipedal
hominid footprints from East Africa whirh had been

dated to three-and-one-half million years ago. "From my
perspective, the evidence shows bipedalism (in
afarensis)," he concluded.
Since 1979, Johanson has been fairly secure about his
interpretation of the fossil record. He conceded, however,
that there may be surprises waiting. For example, there is
a gap in the fossil record between two and three million
years ago that may hide fossils that could help resolve the
A. afarensis controversy. Johanson did most of his work
on afarensis in the '70s at Hadar in Ethiopia, but he was
recently awarded a permit to begin work at Olduvai
Gorge in Tanzania, where the Leakeys made most of their
discoveries.

years ago that may hide fossils that could help resolve the
A. afarensis controversy. Johanson did most of his work
on afarensis in the '70s at Hadar in Ethiopia, but he was
recently awarded a permit to begin work at Olduvai
Gorge in Tanzania, where the Leakeys made most of their
discoveries.


Johanson's Theory


Leakey's Theory
The study of human evolutionary origins is a story of
both consensus and controversy, according to Donald
Johanson, a Stanford anthropology professor who works
with Berkeley's Institute of Human Origins.
Ever since the early 19th century, when the first fossils
of human ancestors were identified, the study of human
beginnings has been punctuated by dramatic, often emo
tional controversies over the validity of proposed theories
or the significance of fossil finds, Johanson said.
Currently one of the foremost figures in the field of
human evolution, Johanson is perhaps best known for his
discovery of Lucy, the famous, near-complete fossil
skeleton of a small human ancestor that stalked the plains
of Africa more than three million years ago. Johanson dis
cussed the current status of the controversy over Lucy and
defended his work in a speech to the Winter Colloquium
on Population Studies here Feb. 19.
The current debate raging in human evolutionary
circles centers on whether the species Lucy belonged to
(named Australopithecus afarensis by Johanson) was a
direct human ancestor or an offshoot that continued to
evolve but eventually died out. There is also some discus
sion as to whether A. afarensis was even a distinct species
— some anthropologists feel it was only an early form of
the species Australopithecus africanus.
Johanson said these questions have been raised because
"we are often faced with a discontinuous and fragmentary
fossil record." In this situation, "people have various in
terpretations about what the fossils we do have do mean."

Part of this problem is one of definition — determining
what exactly constitutes a species.
There are currently two basic schools of thought about
A. afarensis. One school, proposed originally by Johanson
and others in a 1979 issue of Science magazine, puts
afarensis at a point where the human family tree diverged:
one branch went on to produce the genus Homo and
eventually man, while the other evolved first into
A.africanus and then into a larger, heavier relative,
Australopithecus robustus, which eventually died out. The
second school of thought, championed by Richard
Leakey, son of famed anthropologist Louis Leakey, holds
that the genuses Australopithecus and Homo were entirely
separate lines, with A. afarensis being the ancestor of later
Australopithecines but not of Homo. An as yet unknown
hominid (man-like being) would then presumably provide
the ancestry of the genus Homo.
A third, less well-known theory proposes a two
branched tree with the split occurring at A. africanus
(later than afarensis), but Johanson discounted this as not
fitting the evidence.
Johanson described A. afarensis as a "generalized,
primitive hominid" with an ape-like skull — a small brain
but large face — and upright posture. This showed what
he called "mosaic evolution"— when different anatomical
systems are evolutionarily selected for at different speeds.
Homo habilis and Homo erectus, more recent ancestors of
man, then went on after afarensis to develop large brains.
When arguing against A. afarensis as a direct human an
cestor, people try to fit the evidence to their preconceived
ideas, Johanson said. For example, scientist Jack Stern
and others have proposed that A. afarensis was arboreal,
or tree-dwelling, because its arm sockets tended to point

up, implying that the arms were usually held overhead in
order to swing from branches. This would make the crea
ture an unlikely candidate for direct human ancestry.
Johanson then refuted this by pointing out that there is
a great deal of variation in arm sockets (and other similar
traits) in humans even now, and added that it is difficult to
generalize from the few afarensis shoulders that have been
found. He also described how the afarensis big toe did not
diverge from the other toes and that none of them could
grasp very well. This is a big argument for bipedalism
(walking upright) in the creature, he said. To clinch this
Johanson then showed a photo of fossil, obviously bipedal
hominid footprints from East Africa whirh had been

dated to three-and-one-half million years ago. "From my
perspective, the evidence shows bipedalism (in
afarensis)," he concluded.
Since 1979, Johanson has been fairly secure about his
interpretation of the fossil record. He conceded, however,
that there may be surprises waiting. For example, there is
a gap in the fossil record between two and three million
years ago that may hide fossils that could help resolve the
A. afarensis controversy. Johanson did most of his work
on afarensis in the '70s at Hadar in Ethiopia, but he was
recently awarded a permit to begin work at Olduvai
Gorge in Tanzania, where the Leakeys made most of their
discoveries.
