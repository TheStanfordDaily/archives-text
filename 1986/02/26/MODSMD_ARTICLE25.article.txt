"Bessie Smith"

Penguin, New York, 1986
Bessie's eyes seduced me to begin
her story, the way they must have
seduced her many men — and
women.
A quaint black-and-white photo
graph shows the 1920s blues singer
Bessie Smith at age 26, eyes bright
and whimsical, a broad smile and as
yet unbroadened waist.
A photo taken only 10 years later
shows Bessie aged more than a de
cade, having accumulated some la
mentable life experience and layers of
fat, unsmiling if Empressorial, eyes
bright not with the vigor of youth but
bright with pain turned to tenacity.
"Bessie Smith: Empress of the
Blues" by Elaine Feinstein is the first
installment of a new Penguin series
that promies an "imaginative
reconstruction of a person and a
milieu" rather than a conventioanl
biography. Certainly Bessie Smith's
story could not be called conven
tional.
"Bessie Smith" begins with
Bessie's impoverished and parentless
Chatanooga childhood. The book fol
lows Bessie from early tent-shows as
an unknown performer, to the stage,
where she uses her big voice and big
body to establish a bawdy reputation
and a matriarchal stage manner that
win her notoriety.
Bessie's personal life provides a
provocative sideshow, always tumul
tuous and promiscuous, often scan
dalous and even violent. Her career
spans Prohibition in 1920 and the
Stock Market Crash of 1929, the
emergence of "Talkies" and the
debuts of Billie Holiday and Ella
Fitzgerald.
The book concluded with an ex
amination of the enigma that sur

rounds Bessie's death in a 1937 car
accident, controversial because of the
culpability of the doctor who arrived
on the scene who may have let Bessie
bleed to death because of her black
blood.
At times, the unconventional ap
proach to Bessie's story lends itself to
Bessie' unconventional lifestyle. But
at times the book, which is organized
more around Bessie's character than
chronology, confuses the already
whirlwind way of life led by Bessie.
The book's only strongpoint is its
amusing and often alarming
anecdotes that provide more insight
into Bessie's character than any of
Feinstein's comments, which are
simplistic and often naive. One such
instance is the time when Bessie belts
her best woman friend because she
catches her kissing a handsome
stagehand, whom Bessie regards as
her own.
The book opens eloquently. "In
her song nothing melts, yields or
seduces. Her voice is harsh and
coarse, undeterred by everything she
knows about touring in tents, street
fights and casual sex. She isn't trying
to please anyone. The habit of sub
mission, of letting yourself by used,
comes too easily to women. In
Bessie's voice is a full-hearted rejec
tion of any such foolishness." Unfor
tunately, Feinstein's eloquence and
insight are short-lived.
As Feinstein's writing departs from
her depiction fo Bessie's musical in
tegrity that promises personal in
tegrity, the feminist narrative poten
tial of the book wanes and falls as flat
as a poorly sung note.
Feinstein's feminist faux pas are all
the more laudable because it is clearly
Feinstein's intention to herald a
woman's strength in Bessie Smith's
experience. Bessie's "lonely voice,"
writes Feinstein, "opposes a stubborn
pride to the ordinary injustices of
men," one of several positive asser
tions about Bessie's independence

that set the tone of the book early on.
Similarly, Feinstein ends Bessie's
story with a sense of awe at her in
tegrity. "Bessie knew what the world
thought was her place," (as a woman,
as a black) "but she did not accept
that place. And so we remember her
on her own terms." Yet is Bessie
choosing her own terms when she
stays with a husband who repeatedly
beats her and exploits her financially?
More importantly, is Feinstein utiliz
ing appropriate terms to represent
Bessie's life when she implicitly en
dorses such brutality, with such
phrases as Bessie's husband "could
only express his anger and frustration
by hitting Bessie"?
Feinstein's portrayal romaticizes
behavior where it should repudiate.
Her depiction of a tragic dependency
between a man and a woman disturb
ingly endorses dogma that keeps bat
tered wives with battered husbands,
embellishing backward chivalric
codes with cliche.
Her most blatant glorification of
Bessie's self-deprecating and
debilitating dependency is manifested
when she begins a chapter, "Jack was
stronger than Bessie, and she respected
him most when he challenged her
physically."
What is most irksome about
Feinstein's account of Bessie and
Jack's pathological relationship is
that Jack is portrayed as the victim
(echoing a common misplaced sym
pathy for wife-beaters articulated at
large). Writes Feinstein, "It was not
surprising that Jack drew away" from
Bessie. "He had never enjoyed drink
ing as Bessie did." Would it have
been equally unsurprising had Bessie
drawn away from Jack's drawn fists,
never having enjoyed being hit as
much as he enjoyed hitting?
Moreover Feinstein calls Jack a
"moral policeman" to Bessie's
touring troupe — a moral policeman
who beats his wife?
The greatest tragedy of Feinstein's

depiction of Bessie Smith's pathologi
cal dependency, however, is that it
undercuts Bessie's potentially liberat
ing behavior, both professionally and
personally. Bessie Smith's outlandish
behavior, characterized by multiple
sexual partners, bisexuality, big
boozing, wild parties, exhibitionism
and disregard for both black and
white etiquette, falls short of its
liberating potential because of
Feinstein's portrayal.
Bessie's proud carriage of her
massive body, for instance, in spite of
contemporary trends that favored
petite blues artists, is depicted well —
until Feinstein taints the image when
she remarks, "Something in the way
Bessie carried herself made men for
get her size and her blunt features." If
Bessie's size is such a source of
majesty and matriarchal strength, as
Feinstein maintains, then what's to
forget — for men to forget?
Similarly, when Bessie physically
defends her friends and her own
romantic or sexual associations, as
she often does quite competently,
what might be viewed as feminine
power to be celebrated turns into a
pathetic perpetuation of the battering
behavior of her husband, Frank Gee.
Feinstein prefaces Bessie's story
with what she calls the "emotional
reality that underlies the blues,"
namely, the emotional and physical
hardship of black women at the hands
of black men and white society, that
underscores the primarily female
voice of early city blues.
The blues were a cathartic force for
black women of the '20s and '30s, and
perhaps their therapeutic value
endures for women today. Yet the
fact that Feinstein acknowledges the
relationship between the blues and
the bruises of oppressed women, but
writes of Bessie with a lan
guage and point of view that perpetu
ate the oppression in their inherent
attitudes, makes the book all the

more contemptible. Lyrics carefully
integrated within the narrative ap
pear pathetic, though poetic, instead
of triumphant, in the context of
Feinstein's narrative.
The feminist potential of "Bessie
Smith" is clearly articulated in the

opening passages of the book, but if
Bessie's "courageous spirit" in
response to oppression resonates in
her throaty, raspy voice as Feinstein
would suggest, it fails to resonate in
Feinstein's rendition of Bessie's life
and career.

reconstruction of a person and a
milieu" rather than a conventioanl
biography. Certainly Bessie Smith's
story could not be called conven
tional.
"Bessie Smith" begins with
Bessie's impoverished and parentless
Chatanooga childhood. The book fol
lows Bessie from early tent-shows as
an unknown performer, to the stage,
where she uses her big voice and big
body to establish a bawdy reputation
and a matriarchal stage manner that
win her notoriety.
Bessie's personal life provides a
provocative sideshow, always tumul
tuous and promiscuous, often scan
dalous and even violent. Her career
spans Prohibition in 1920 and the
Stock Market Crash of 1929, the
emergence of "Talkies" and the
debuts of Billie Holiday and Ella
Fitzgerald.
The book concluded with an ex
amination of the enigma that sur

rounds Bessie's death in a 1937 car
accident, controversial because of the
culpability of the doctor who arrived
on the scene who may have let Bessie
bleed to death because of her black
blood.
At times, the unconventional ap
proach to Bessie's story lends itself to
Bessie' unconventional lifestyle. But
at times the book, which is organized
more around Bessie's character than
chronology, confuses the already
whirlwind way of life led by Bessie.
The book's only strongpoint is its
amusing and often alarming
anecdotes that provide more insight
into Bessie's character than any of
Feinstein's comments, which are
simplistic and often naive. One such
instance is the time when Bessie belts
her best woman friend because she
catches her kissing a handsome
stagehand, whom Bessie regards as
her own.
The book opens eloquently. "In
her song nothing melts, yields or
seduces. Her voice is harsh and
coarse, undeterred by everything she
knows about touring in tents, street
fights and casual sex. She isn't trying
to please anyone. The habit of sub
mission, of letting yourself by used,
comes too easily to women. In
Bessie's voice is a full-hearted rejec
tion of any such foolishness." Unfor
tunately, Feinstein's eloquence and
insight are short-lived.
As Feinstein's writing departs from
her depiction fo Bessie's musical in
tegrity that promises personal in
tegrity, the feminist narrative poten
tial of the book wanes and falls as flat
as a poorly sung note.
Feinstein's feminist faux pas are all
the more laudable because it is clearly
Feinstein's intention to herald a
woman's strength in Bessie Smith's
experience. Bessie's "lonely voice,"
writes Feinstein, "opposes a stubborn
pride to the ordinary injustices of
men," one of several positive asser
tions about Bessie's independence

that set the tone of the book early on.
Similarly, Feinstein ends Bessie's
story with a sense of awe at her in
tegrity. "Bessie knew what the world
thought was her place," (as a woman,
as a black) "but she did not accept
that place. And so we remember her
on her own terms." Yet is Bessie
choosing her own terms when she
stays with a husband who repeatedly
beats her and exploits her financially?
More importantly, is Feinstein utiliz
ing appropriate terms to represent
Bessie's life when she implicitly en
dorses such brutality, with such
phrases as Bessie's husband "could
only express his anger and frustration
by hitting Bessie"?
Feinstein's portrayal romaticizes
behavior where it should repudiate.
Her depiction of a tragic dependency
between a man and a woman disturb
ingly endorses dogma that keeps bat
tered wives with battered husbands,
embellishing backward chivalric
codes with cliche.
Her most blatant glorification of
Bessie's self-deprecating and
debilitating dependency is manifested
when she begins a chapter, "Jack was
stronger than Bessie, and she respected
him most when he challenged her
physically."
What is most irksome about
Feinstein's account of Bessie and
Jack's pathological relationship is
that Jack is portrayed as the victim
(echoing a common misplaced sym
pathy for wife-beaters articulated at
large). Writes Feinstein, "It was not
surprising that Jack drew away" from
Bessie. "He had never enjoyed drink
ing as Bessie did." Would it have
been equally unsurprising had Bessie
drawn away from Jack's drawn fists,
never having enjoyed being hit as
much as he enjoyed hitting?
Moreover Feinstein calls Jack a
"moral policeman" to Bessie's
touring troupe — a moral policeman
who beats his wife?
The greatest tragedy of Feinstein's

depiction of Bessie Smith's pathologi
cal dependency, however, is that it
undercuts Bessie's potentially liberat
ing behavior, both professionally and
personally. Bessie Smith's outlandish
behavior, characterized by multiple
sexual partners, bisexuality, big
boozing, wild parties, exhibitionism
and disregard for both black and
white etiquette, falls short of its
liberating potential because of
Feinstein's portrayal.
Bessie's proud carriage of her
massive body, for instance, in spite of
contemporary trends that favored
petite blues artists, is depicted well —
until Feinstein taints the image when
she remarks, "Something in the way
Bessie carried herself made men for
get her size and her blunt features." If
Bessie's size is such a source of
majesty and matriarchal strength, as
Feinstein maintains, then what's to
forget — for men to forget?
Similarly, when Bessie physically
defends her friends and her own
romantic or sexual associations, as
she often does quite competently,
what might be viewed as feminine
power to be celebrated turns into a
pathetic perpetuation of the battering
behavior of her husband, Frank Gee.
Feinstein prefaces Bessie's story
with what she calls the "emotional
reality that underlies the blues,"
namely, the emotional and physical
hardship of black women at the hands
of black men and white society, that
underscores the primarily female
voice of early city blues.
The blues were a cathartic force for
black women of the '20s and '30s, and
perhaps their therapeutic value
endures for women today. Yet the
fact that Feinstein acknowledges the
relationship between the blues and
the bruises of oppressed women, but
writes of Bessie with a lan
guage and point of view that perpetu
ate the oppression in their inherent
attitudes, makes the book all the

more contemptible. Lyrics carefully
integrated within the narrative ap
pear pathetic, though poetic, instead
of triumphant, in the context of
Feinstein's narrative.
The feminist potential of "Bessie
Smith" is clearly articulated in the

opening passages of the book, but if
Bessie's "courageous spirit" in
response to oppression resonates in
her throaty, raspy voice as Feinstein
would suggest, it fails to resonate in
Feinstein's rendition of Bessie's life
and career.
