"Careerism and Intellectualism Among Col
lege Students"
John Boli and Herant Katchadourian
San Francisco, Jossey-Bass, 1985
True, the eternal student has become passe,
and activism is on the decline, but is intellec
tual idealism really waning? John Boli and
Herant Katchadourian would have us believe
so. To anyone who hasn't notice the rise of
career counseling and the waning of
"alternative" educational programs, the aut
hors of "Careerism and Intellectualism"
preach a dreary message indeed: our college
students are turning down the doctorate for
the dollar sign.
The book discusses the effect on the stu
dent population of what the authors term
"careerism." Since today's student is becom

ing increasingly more interested in what he
"does" after graduation than in the pure pur
suit of knowledge, students have fragmented
into four basic categories — with correspond
ing degrees of career interest.
All this is nothing new — at least not for the
Stanford student. Our university is noted for
its careerist orientation; a large percent of the
students enter with pre-law, pre-med or engi
neering aspirations, knowing at the beginning
of their freshman year just what they want out
of a college education (whether or not they
get it is another question). The hard-and-fast
Stanford environment may be somewhat
atypical, but it provided fertile soil for the au
thor's research.
To prove their point, Boli and
Katchadourian interviewed a cohort group of
Stanford students between 1977 and 1981,
asking them questions about their academic
background, their family and economic back
grounds, and their academic and social goals

and plans. From these interviews, they came
up with the idea that there are four types of
students; intellectuals, strivers, careerists and
the "unconnected."
Most of the book is dedicated to the
codifaction and description of these sub
groups. My initial reaction to this approach
was suspicion; I have an objection to anyone
being stuck into a category for an easy discus
sion of a preordained conclusion, and an es
pecial objection when I, as a student, am the
one being categorized. And reading the des
criptions of each "type" didn't completely
convince me that the pigeonholes were valid.
It's not that the categories are fuzzy; at
least three out of the four definitions were
pretty clear-cut. Careerists are simply people
who spend as much time in the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center as the intellectuals
do in the library, and strivers strive to divide
their time and energies equally. The

"unconnected" category was nebulous but ac
ceptable; it's the apologetic subgroup of
"other" that hallmarks every exhaustive sur
vey.
But it's the existence of these categories
that creates the problem; it seems to me to be
an oversimplification, albeit a useful one.
Armed with categories, we look at the case
studies in the book not as individuals but as
examples of a particular type. We learn only
as much about them as is necessary to prove
the author's point. Perhaps I'm pointing a
finger at a standard research technique; but in
this case, with the subjects of study so familiar
to me, I'm skeptical about the way in which
students slide so easily into the right places.
All of my problems with methodology don't
mean that I disagree with the message of the
book; I too think today's students are becom
ing increasingly concerned with career rather
than academic goals. But just who is

Katchadourian trying to explain this to?
"Careerism and Intellectualism" isn't a mass
market book, or even one intended for gen
eral undergraduate reading; the coverstyle
and analytic approach peg it for a sociologist's
or educational theorist's textbook. The
"recommendations" section at the end of the
book seems to be addressed to educational
administrators; perhaps this is the intended
audience. But the advice given isn't in-depth
enough for an administrator's guidebook.
Despite my problems with the approach, I
found the book caused me to question my
own attitudes toward education. And though
I'd rather not type myself as an "intellectual"
or "careerist," 1 found myself categorizing my
friends (don't we all) and wanting to read
them relevant passages. So ultimately, the
book may not be successful in all respects, it
does serve a useful function — helping stu
dents to define why they're really at school,
and helping educators to define students.
