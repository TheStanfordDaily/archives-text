## Men's and women's basketball rules should be codified Stanford's chances for postseason slight 
### 
The 1985-86 basketball season is almost
over, and the NCAA's first experiment with a
45-second shot clock has met with virtually
total approval. No one I've talked to has
voiced a desire to return to the days of eight
minute stalls without a clock.
The choice of 45 seconds seems appropri
ate — teams have a chance to run their of
fense two or three times before having to
force a shot. And it has eliminated some of
the interminable semi-intentional fouls that
plagued the latter stages of many games.
Forty-five seconds is also long enough to al
low zone defenses and not to require a three
point field goal.
The question is why the NCAA doesn't
adopt the same rule for women's games. Cur
rently, they play with a 30-second clock,
which is not enough time. Often, teams can
only run through its offenses once before

firing up a desperation shot to beat the clock.
That's not good basketball, and it's not ex
citing to watch teams fire up prayers because
the clock is running down.
Another difference between the two games
is the lack of a 10-second backcourt violation
in the women's game. Right now, a team can
take all the time it wants to bring the ball up
court, which hurts teams with effective full
court presses.
The NCAA put an over-and-back violation
into the women's game last year. It's time it
added the 10-second count.
Bleaker and bleaker
With its loss at UCLA on Monday, the
Stanford men's basketball team is in fifth
place in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 7-7
conference record, 13-13 overall.
To finish with a winning record, the Card

inal must go 3-1 in its last four games against
Oregon State and USC at home and at Wash
ington and Washington State — a possible
task, but not an easy one.

The loss to UCLA was particularly painful
for Stanford's postseason tournament hopes.
As the defending champions of the National
Invitational Tournament, the NIT officials
will in all likelihood give the Bruins a bid if

they can finish with a winning record.
UCLA is now ahead of Stanford at 8-7,
good for fourth place. The thinking is that any
team that finishes ahead of the Bruins will
probably get a bid if UCLA does, but nothing
is certain.
The other thought is that at most two Pac
-10 teams will get NIT bids. Should Stanford
and California tie in the standings, Cal would
get the nod over Stanford thanks to the Bears'
better overall record and two wins over Stan
ford.
So, the thinking is that Stanford needs to
finish all alone in third place to go to the NIT.
With UCLA a half-game ahead and Cal a
game ahead of the Cardinal, that becomes a
difficult order.
Forget the NCAA. Arizona and Washing
ton are probably the only two teams going to
that tournament. By the way, Stanford is out

of the conference championship hunt, trailing
the co-leaders by four games with four to
play, and an Arizona-Washington game being
one of those.
Sibling success
Someone in Los Angeles pointed out that
the Millers — USC forward Cheryl and
UCLA forward Reggie — combined for 73 in
their respective games against Stanford this
weekend.
Both are the top scorers in their respective
conferences, and both have a chance at the
conference Player of the Year award —
Cheryl for certain, Reggie maybe.
The only good news — Cheryl graduates
this year. Reggie's around for another season.
