# Batsmen fall to 11-5 on season
## Cardinal falters against USF, 2-1 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO — Everyone's tried to hold onto a wet bar of soap in the
shower. The cursed thing's so slick, it just slip-slides away.
And pretty soon, it's too late. Yep, it's vanished down the drain.
Well, this year's Stanford baseball team is a lot like that. The harder you try
to get a handle on it.the more slippery it gets. One moment it's there, and the
next, oops, its gone.
Take yesterday's 2-1 Cardinal loss to the hapless University of San Fran
cisco. Stanford was coming off what Coach Mark Marquess termed his team's
"best game of the year," a 15-hit, 11-4 drubbing of Santa Clara. There were
noises that the Cardinal, 11-4 before yesterday's debacle, finally had a firm
grip on things.
In the space of only nine innings, Stanford's hold loosened, and our little bar
of soap shot out. And it might be hard to pick up again.
Stanford scraped together only six hits, all singles, against Duffy Aceret.
Aceret's the same pitcher who less than a month ago was tagged with six runs
in less than four innings of work at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford hammered the Dons 12-6 that day. Yesterday was a different story
entirely.
Aceret, in improving his record to 2-2, went the full nine innings, giving up
only a single run in the eighth, walking two and striking out three. He pitched
out of trouble in the fourth, leaving runners on first and third, and again in the
fifth, inducing John Ramos to ground out to short with the bases loaded.
Otherwise, he was in thorough command. "I was basically using my fastball
early in the count to get ahead," said Aceret, a junior who transferred from
Skyline Junior College this year. "When I was able to get ahead of the hitters, I
could kind of start to play with them."
Aceret pitched into a three-ball jam four times yesterday.
"I know when I'm pitching well if I get a lot of groundball outs," Aceret
said. The righty got Stanford hitters to bounce out 15 times.
USFs defense welcomed Aceret's ability to stay ahead of the Cardinal hit
ters. In the last meeting of the two teams, the Don pitching staff issued a whop
ping 12 free passes.
"He was throwing strikes and that helps keep the infield awake," USF third
baseman Ray McDonald said. "We were in the game at all times."
Aceret's fine outing made a tough-luck loser out of Stanford starter Kevin
Kunkel, 0-2. The senior right-hander lasted through six innings, surrendering
two runs on three hits. He walked none and struck out two.
Kunkel baffled USFs hitters, but
in the end was victimized by his own
teammates. Both Don runs were un
earned.
In the bottom of the second Joe
Williams singled to right center stole
second and moved to third on a
passed ball. Williams scored on
shortstop Frank Carey's two-out
throwing error.
Three innings later, there was more
of the same Cardinal bumbling. Ed
Sprague displayed a Steve Berriatua
grounder to third into a two-base er
ror. Berriatua advanced to third on a
wild pitch then scored on Doug
Hupke's sacrifice fly to right field.
Stanford's only run came in the top
of the eighth. With one out, Ramos
lined a single to left. He stole second
and scored on Ruben Amaro's RBl
single past McDonald at third.
