Frederick Nietzsche once said:
"Anything that doesn't kill you
makes you stronger."
If that statement is true, then the
Stanford men's tennis team should be
much stronger after yesterday's 7-2
victory over the visiting University of
San Diego Toreros.
The Cardinal overcame the ab
sence of seniors Jim Grabb and Dan
Goldie in singles play, a default by
senior John Letts and a gutty perfor
mance by the Toreros to record the
victory.
For a while, however, it looked as if
Stanford might not survive.
In No. 3 singles, Letts spotted the
Toreros a quick 1-0 lead by default
ing to San Diego's Scott Patridge,
with Patridge leading 6-4. 2-1. Letts
led 4-1 in the first set. but then lost
eight out of the last nine games
before leaving the court.
Letts had no comment on why he
defaulted but did return to play in the
No. 1 doubles match.
Toreros freshman Takeshi Omono
then stretched San Diego's lead to 2-
0 by defeating Stanford junior
Geordie McKee 6-0. 6-3 in No. 6
singles.
Meanwhile. Cardinal netters
Patrick McEnroe and Eric Rosenfeld
were struggling with Jim McNamee
and David Stewart in No. 1 and No. 2
singles respectively.
When San Diego's Chris Smith and
Cardinal Scott Moody each took a set
in the No. 4 singles, some interesting
thoughts were flying through people's
minds.
"I was surprised at that point."
McNamee said. "When Chris (Smith)
split sets, it got pretty interesting."
McFnroe said, "When thev took

the first two and Eric and I were
having a little trouble, it was looking
a little shaky for a while.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould put it
more succinctly. "It was a little
scary," he said.
With the unexpected pressure on,
the Cardinal players responded by
winning the final four singles
matches.
Junior Mark Jacobson posted Stan
ford's first victory of the day, and his
first win in a long time, by defeating
Alejandro Ramos in No. 5 singles in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.
Moody responded by getting angry.
The junior from Larchmont, N.Y.
became peeved at the world in gen
eral after his opponent. Smith, got
red hot and took the second set 6-4 to
even up the match.
Moody received a code violation
for one outburst early in the third set,
and proceeded to serve an ace on the
very next point. The junior used his
intensity and blew by Smith to win
the last five games of the match to
post the 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 win.
Stanford finally took control of the
match when McEnroe squeezed by
McNamee 6-4. 7-6 (7-3).
"I fell asleep a bit at the beginning
of each set." McEnroe said of his per
formance. "But I played well when I
had to."
Rosenfeld finished off singles play
for Stanford by defeating Stewart 7-
6. 6-4. Rosenfeld struggled early, and
as usual, his match was the longest of
the day.
"Eric started a little tight, but after
a few games I thought he played
rather intelligently," Gould said after
the match.
Stanford took a 4-2 lead into the
doubles and proceeded to sweep the
