# Stanford abstains from H-P voting
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Staff writer 
The University yesterday
abstained from voting on a share
holder resolution which would
have forced Hewlett-Packard
Corp. to stop selling computers to
the South African government.
The resolution, voted on at a
shareholders meeting in Cuper
tino, "garnered approximately 7.6
of the vote." according to Barbara
Kommer, manager of H-P invest
ment communications.
Proposed by the Foreign and
Domestic Mission of the Protes
tant Episcopal Church of the
United States of America, a stock
holder in the company, the resolu
tion mandated that "the corpora

tion and any subsidiaries shall not
make or renew any contracts or
agreements to sell or service com
puters, computer parts or software
to, or for the use of, the govern
ment of South Africa or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities," ac
cording to Gene Endicott, an H-P
spokesman.
The same proposal had been
brought to the company for a vote
in 1981 and 1982 and was
defeated both times, he said.
The University's Commission
on Investment Responsibility (C
-1R) decided to abstain from voting
on the resolution at its meeting
last Thursday. C-IR's motion to
recommend that Stanford not vote
on the proposal carried by a
vote of seven to two with one
member abstaining.
An earlier motion to advise
the University to support the
shareholder resolution failed
by three to six. One member
abstained from voting.
The University's decision to
abstain from voting was trans
mitted to H-P by proxy, said
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, chairman of the C-IR.
C-1R "recommended
abstaining because the way the
resolution was constructed, it
would have required H-P to
withdraw support from hospi
tals and schools," he said.
Jonathan l urk, a student
member of C-IR, said the com
mission decided to abstain be
cause "there were not enough
votes for (supporting the
resolution), but we didn't want
to vote no either."
C-IR's recommendation to
abstain from voting on the
shareholder resolution in no
way means that the University
has departed from its goal of
using its shareholdings to push
for change in South Africa,
Brody said.
