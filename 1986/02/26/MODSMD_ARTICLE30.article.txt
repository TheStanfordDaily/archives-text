# Murphy remains close to Farm

### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Pretend for a while that you have
been given the task of creating the
perfect announcer for Stanford
sports. What ingredients would you
put in the test tube? How would you
mix them?
First, the person should have at
tended Stanford. That way he could
really understand the school's tradi
tions. He'd need to have a great
knowledge of all sports. How about
if he could have played here, mabye
in the pros, too? You'd want some
one who could be a charming am
bassador for the University, and
someone who could amuse his
audiences while still maintaining his
objectivity.
Yes, such an ideal person would
be nice to have, but who could do all
that? Put away the test tube and the
genetic engineering books because
this person already exists.
Bob Murphy, known as Murph to
his friends and radio listeners, is
such a person. Luckily for Stanford,
he has remained close to his alma
mater.
Murphy came to Stanford in 1949
on a partial baseball scholarship, the
one where the University pays for
two out of three quarters of a stu
dent's tuition. After graduating in
1953. he also attended the business
school for two years, but did not
earn his degree.
"When 1 was at Stanford, tuition
was $220 a quarter. I remember
that there was a campus uproar
when it was raised from $200 to
$220." Murphy said.
While on the Farm. Murphy was a
pitcher on the baseball team. He
also batted as there were no desig
nated hitters.
"As a pitcher. I was known for
having a little bit of everything. 1

can't say that I had one really great
pitch. I also was a pretty good hitter
since I played third base in high
school and was used to looking at
pitches." Murphy explained.
As a senior Murphy and his
teammates earned the distinction of
becoming the first Stanford team to

play in Omaha in the College World
Series. After graduating, he went on
to play professionally with the Oak
land As of the old Coast League.
Surprisingly, though, his three
years in pro baseball were not what
whetted his appetite for broadcast
ing.

"I first got interested in jour
nalism here at Stanford," Murphy
said. "My best buddy. Jack
Shepard, and I took a class from
(Prof.) Stanley Donner in Mem
Aud. (He) and an editor of the then
Palo Alto Times, Walt Gamage,
really got me interested. Walt was
half a father and half a big brother
to me."
Unlike most people trying to
crack into broadcasting. Murphy did
not have to go to the boonies to do
so. His first job came here in Palo
Alto at a small FM radio station
named KIBE.
"I produced and did a 15-minute
interview show on Saturday nights
called 'Stanford Spotlight." I would
talk to coaches and players,"
Murphy said. "I basically sold the
show myself to the merchants in
Town and Country Village, since
that had just opened."
Murphy's entree into Stanford
sports came in 1964. While playing
Notre Dame in South Bend,
Murphy was asked to sit in with
Don Klein, Stanford's announcer.
Murphy was well-received and took
a job with Klein.
"Since I was acting in a capacity
like that of a public relations man,
one of the first of its kind for college
athletics. I was always at the games.
I was knowledgable, and I was
hired," Murphy said.
Klein and Murphy broadcasted
together for 11 years from 1964 to
1975. Murphy left his role of radio
commentating to become sports
director of the San Jose-based Gill
Cable company. He returned to the
airwaves of KCBS when Klein
took on the job of play-by-play an
nouncer for the San Francisco
49'ers.

Job Murphy has remained an integral part of Stanford athletics
hrough the years as an athlete, public relations man and now
iroadcaster.
In his many year of watching sports
on the Farm, Murphy has seen many
great moments. One though, stands
out particularly in his mind.
"I would have to say that Rod Gar
cia's field goal on the last play of the
1971 Rose Bowl was the most excit
ing one I've seen," Murphy
reminisced. "Not only did it mean a
second consecutive Rose Bowl win,
but it was great for people like quar
terback Don Bunce, who had to wait
patiently for Jim Plunkett to
graduate."
You might think that with only
having to work one or two days a
week, Murphy would have oodles of
free time. You might think that, but
you'd be wrong. Murphy may only
work two to three hours at a stretch,
but the time he must put in to prepare
for a broadcast is vast.
"As a color commentator, I have to
prepare extensively for each game,"
he said. "For me this goes beyond
learning the names of the players. I
like to be able to talk to the coaches
and find out a little about each team's

game plan.
"Last Monday, some of our assis
tant coaches said that in order to beat
UCLA, we would have to stop their
transition game. Stanford didn't, and
they lost badly. I feel I've done a
good job when I can tell the audience
these things and see what happens as
the game develops."
Murphy also said that basketball is
easier to prepare for than football.
He explained that there are fewer
players in basketball, and that teams
play each other in the Pacific 10 Con
ference twice so there is more than
one opportunity to get a look at an
opponent.
Anyone who has ever listened to
Murphy's broadcasts immediately
notices his sense of humor and easy
going style. Naturally, this does not
happen by accident.
"I still view sports as entertain
ment," Murphy said. "With all the
problems of drug abuse and academic
problems in athletics, there is a ten
dency to make sports reporting
'heavy.' I try to bring it back to what
it really is, which is fun. There is too
much seriousness in the world in
places like Manila to make sports
serious, too."
