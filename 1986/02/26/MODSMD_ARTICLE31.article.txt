# Stanford sophomore competes against unseen opponents
## Judo player Lewis sneaks up on foes 
### MIMI COUGHLIN 
"It is an advantage to a degree
because people don't expect
much," Stanford sophomore Brett
Lewis said of the way blindness af
fects his judo career.
Lewis lost his sight at the age of
six, and began the sport in which
he now excels eight years later.
Lewis had competed as a wrestler,
but turned to judo because he
thought it was "more exciting."
He said the first gym he tried
to train in rejected him because of
his blindness. He also remembers
with satisfaction beating fighters
from that same gym years later.
"I've never played judo when I
could see so there's no compari
son," Lewis said when asked if his
blindness was a handicap.
However, "I don't get to see who
I'm going to fight, and I haven't
seen them before."
Because judo is similar to wres
tling, Lewis is able to capitalize on
his acute sensual perception and
nonvisual awareness of his op
ponent's position.
"I usually hear where they are
because they slide their feet," he
said.
Stanford Coach Willy Cahill at
tributed Lewis' success to "good
coordination and good moves,"
and also noted Lewis's determina
tion and desire to win.
"He is stubborn because he
doesn't like to lose," Cahill said.
"He doesn't know how big the
guys he is up against are unitl he
can grab onto them and start
throwing them around."
Lewis, who earned a blackbelt
in June 1984, attributes his own
success to hard work and a willing
ness to train and compete in pain.
He has been plagued by a string of
arm and wrist injuries for the past

two years. Some of his motivation
comes from the desire to prove
"the people who think I can't do
it" wrong.
And prove them wrong he has.
The highlights of Lewis' com
petitive career include third place
at the 1984 U.S. National Cham
pionships — a distinction he
earned at age 17 — and being cho
sen to train at the Olympic Train
ing Center in Colorado Springs,
Colo. The Spokane, Wash, native
spent last August in Belgium com
peting as a member of the seven
man U.S. National Team.
One of his Stanford teammates,
Wesley Mukai, said opponents are
sometimes initally "freaked out"
when matched against Lewis but
added that when the fight begins,
"you don't even think about him
being blind because you know he
can beat you. On the mat he is in
vincible"
Lewis said his rivals are "a bit
timid" when they realize he is
blind. He, however, is frustrated
when players hold back because
they think he is handicapped.
"Keeping up with school" is
what Lewis said he finds hardest
about being a judo player at Stan
ford. Lewis, who participated in
the Structured Liberal Education
program last year, must listen to
recordings of his textbooks and
use a special computer program
for his assignments, both of which
are extremely time-consuming.
Just as Lewis' work in the class
room has paid dividends, so too
have his experiences on the mat.
"It gives me the discipline to do
something that I am actually afraid
of at times," he said of his judo ex
periences. "It's an accomplish
ment that means a lot to me be
cause people would say that I
couldn't do it."
