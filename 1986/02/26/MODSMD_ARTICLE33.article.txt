## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Second-ranked UCLA comes to
Maples Pavilion tonight at 7:30 p.m.
to give the Stanford men's volleyball
team one of its biggest tests of the
year.
The Bruins are 18-3 overall and 4-
3 in the California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association, while Stan
ford is 7-3 overall and 5-3 in CIVA
play. The Cardinal is ranked fourth in
the nation.
Stanford is coming off a three
game win over Chico State Satur
day. UCLA will try to rebound from
a difficult week in which the team lost
to No. 7 Long Beach State Wednes
day 15-3, 15-10, 8-15, 15-17, 12-15
and then fell 15-7, 15-7, 15-7 to un
defeated and third-ranked USC.
Top guns for the Bruins are two
time All-American Asbojorn
Volstad, a junior outside hitter from
Forde, Norway who is leading the
squad in kills with 93, junior outside
hitter Jeff Williams with 67 kills and
sophomore hitter Don Dendinger
with 66 kills. The six-foot-six
Dendinger has a .384 hitting
percentage for the Bruins and
Volstad follows at .365.
Two-time All-American Reed
Sunahara is back after redshirting last
year following a severe moped acci
dent in which the senior outside hitter
had his leg broken in five places.
Sunahara underwent eight operations
and has lost 10 inches off of his 38-
inch vertical jump. The "Flyin'
Hawaiian" has come back with 62
kills this season and a .285
percentage.
The Bruins have won 11 NCAA
championships in the 16-year history
of NCAA volleyball, and have a 23-1
advantage over Stanford.
The good news for Stanford is that
senior All-American Jon Root will be
back in the lineup for the Cardinal
after missing two weeks and four con
ference matches with a sprained
ankle.

"It depends a lot on Root," UCLA
Asst. Coach Greg Giovanazzi said.
"He makes a big difference. Without
Jon, they're not the same team. He's
hard to replace."
"Root is not 100 percent, but at
least he's playing,"Stanford Co-coach
Don Shaw said.
Sophomore Ail-American candi
date Scott Fortune, who missed the
non-conference match at Chico State
because of illness, will be back as well
for the Cardinal ."Unless he's chained
to a hospital bed, he'll be out there,"
Shaw said.
Senior outside hitter Chris Braun
leads the squad in kills with 138,
while Fortune follows with 107. Steve

Blue is third with 74, and is tops on
the team in hitting percentage with a
.365 average.
"Stanford is going to be tough,"
Giovanazzi said. "We've had a tough
week and it's always tough up there.
We don't have real consistent
matches with Stanford. This is a vital
match; we have to win. We've lost
two of our last three. We shouldn't
have lost to Long Beach. They played
pretty flawless volleyball, and we had
some serious problems. We've had to
shake some things up.
"The key for us is Sunahara. If he
keeps getting better, we'll be right in
there. It'll be a great match. Braun
has turned into an excellent player

and Fortune is among the elite in the
country." Giovanazzi added.
"UCLA is having a rocky time
lately," Shaw said, "but Long Beach
is better than anyone expected.
UCLA has a number of experienced
players. Volstad is a fine player â€” the
guy they count on the most. They are
a strong blocking team. Their
strength is at the net.
"It'll be strength against strength
because we have a good hitting at
tack. Year in and year out they're one
of the top teams. The match will be
interesting and it will be close. We're
looking forward to it. Every league
game is really important. There are
no breathers from here on out."

University of San Diego 7-6, 6-4 and help Stanford to a 7-2 victory.

The Stanford volleyball players cannot afford to be falling all over themselves against a powerful UCLA
squad which holds a 23-1 series advantage over the Cardinal.
