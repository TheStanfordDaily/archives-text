NEW YORK (AP) — New Jer
sey Nets guard Micheal Ray Rich
ardson was permanently banned
from the National Basketball As
sociation Tuesday after testing
positive for cocaine, Commis
sioner David Stern said.
Stern called it "a tragic day for
Micheal Ray Richardson, nothing
less than the destruction by
cocaine of a once-flourishing
career."
A player who is disqualified is
eligible for reinstatenment in two
years.
"However, the reinstatement is
not automatic. In order to be
reinstated, it must be approved by
both the NBA and the Players As
sociation," Stern said.
Richardson, whom Stern said
was tested Monday night, is the
second NBA player banned from

the league since its drug agree
ment with the union was instituted
in January 1984. John Drew of the
Utah Jazz was kicked out of the
league last month for a similar in
fraction.
Early last month, when Rich
ardson tested positive for drug use
after a five-day disappearance, the
league ruled that it constituted his
second violation, although he had
twice previously undergone treat
ment.
Later last month, Richardson
failed to appear for a doctor's ap
pointment for treatment for the
flu. When he was tested for drugs
on that occasion, the results were
negative.
The Nets fell to the Golden
State Warriors 116-109 last night
without point guard Richardson.
