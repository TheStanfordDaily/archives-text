# Lichti honored by conference
## 
### 
Stanford rookie Todd Lichti was
named to the Pacific 10 Conference
All-Freshman team yesterday.
Lichti, a 6-foot-4 swingman, leads
the Cardinal in scoring and scorched
the nets for 26 points in a losing cause
at UCLA on Monday. The Concord
native has played a major role Stan
ford's turnaround from a 3-15 league
record last season to this year's 7-7
Pac-10 maik.
Joining Lichti on the rookie squad
are Jerome "Pooh" Richardson of
UCLA, Sean Elliot of Arizona and
USC teammates Tom Lewis and
Greg Kimble.
Richardson, from Ben Franklin
High School in Philadelphia, was
named co-Freshman of the Year with
Elliot. The 6-0 UCLA playmaker
feeds shooters Reggie Miller and
Montel Hatcher to the tune of a
league-leading 6.7 assists per game
while averaging over 10 points per

game himself.
Elliot, a 6-7 forward from Tucson,
was considered to be perhaps the best
high school player in Arizona history.
He has done little to tarnish his
reputation this season as he averages
15 points per game to lead the
Wildcats into a tie for first place in
the conference with Washington.
High-scoring Tom Lewis from
Mater Dei High School and Philadel
phia Dobbins Tech product Greg
Kimble have been two of the few
bright spots in an otherwise disap
pointing Trojan season.
A notable absentee from the squad
is Stanford center Howard Wright.
The 6-8 pivotman anchors the Card
inal defense and is among the Pac
10's top 10 in rebounding. Wright,
however, was the victim of an excep
tionally strong year for rookies in the
Pac-10 and was unable to crack the
first five.
