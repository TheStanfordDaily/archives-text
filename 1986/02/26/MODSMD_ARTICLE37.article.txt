Gorbachev rejects Reagan response
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday attacked
President Reagan's response to his recent proposal for worldwide dis
armament as he convened the 27th congress of the Soviet Communist
Party, his first since he came to power a year ago.
In a five-and-a-half-hour speech, Gorbachev also called for "radical
reform" in the economy, said that the Soviet Union and Afghanistan
have reached agreement on a conditional schedule for "phased
withdrawal" of Soviet troops, and touched on the "damage" done to So
viet society by mismanagement during the rule of Leonid Brezhnev.
It was the 54-year-old Soviet leader's first address to a party congress,
the major, long-range policy-setting meeting of the Communist Party
that normally takes place every five years. The last congress, in 1981,
was presided over by an enfeebled Brezhnev.
After joining the crowded Kremlin Palace of Congresses in silent trib
ute to predecessors Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Cher
nenko, Gorbachev used the occasion — the 30th anniversary of Nikita
Khrushchev's denunciation of Joseph Stalin's reign of terror — to
deliver his vision of the Soviet Union's path into the 21st century and to
define broadly his plans for recovering the ailing Soviet economy and
morale.
Gorbachev made it clear yesterday he was affirming the stamp he has
put on the party in the past year, referring repeatedly to the "April
plenum" — the first meeting of the party's Central Committee held after
he came to power. In it the planning for the nine-day congress that
opened Tuesday was discussed in detail.
The 5,000 Soviet delegates, joined by 154 foreign Communist and
Socialist Party delegations, interrupted Gorbachev nearly 60 times with
applause and gave him a standing ovation.
Gorbachev defended the Soviet Union's proposal on Jan. 15 for a
three-stage elimination of nuclear arms by the year 2000. He said
Reagan's response on Sunday was "swamped in various reservations,
'linkages' and 'conditions' which in fact block the solution of radical
problems of disarmament."
Reagan has said he was pleased at the goal of the Soviet proposal, but
he offered different timetables and rejected some of the conditions at
tached by the Kremlin.
Gorbachev said he found it "hard to detect" in Reagan's response
"any serious preparedness of the U.S. Administration to get down to the
cardinal problems involved in eliminating the nuclear threat."
But he said that "the reply seems to contain some reassuring opinions
and theses," and that Soviet delegates discussing the proposal at the
U.S.-Soviet arms talks in Geneva would "closely examine everything the
U.S. side has to say on these matters."
Reagan requests aid for Contras
WASHINGTON — President Reagan asked Congress yesterday for
$ 100 million in aid to rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government of
Nicaragua, launching what is expected to be another bitter battle over
U.S. policy in Central America.
It would give the counterrevolutionaries $30 million in humanitarian
aid — such as food, clothing, medicine and trucks — and give President
Reagan control of another $70 million to use "for any kind of assistance
he deems appropriate," according to an official fact sheet.
It is an open secret that those funds would be used for military aid to
the estimated 20,000 rebels, although Reagan did not say so.
However, Reagan pledged that he would not regard approval as aut
horizing use of U.S. armed forces against the Nicaraguan government.
The funds would be transferred from already-allocated Defense De
partment funds in six installments over the next 18 months, through the
end of fiscal 1987. Reagan said he would move later to address the
"impairment in defense readiness" caused by the transfer.
Initial congressional reaction was wary but interested. Reagan
removed a possible source of opposition by asking for a transfer of funds
rather than for new money under strictures of the Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings balanced-budget law.
In addition, by asking for spending authority rather than direct mili
tary aid, he also defused at least temporarily the question of covert vs.
overt assistance, which has raised the issues of Central Intelligence
Agency involvement and whether to withdraw recognition of Nicaragua.
Discord in new governing council
PORT-AU-PRINCE and PARIS — The first public sign of division
within Haiti's new governing council has appeared as the justice minister
protested the departure of a former police official linked with torture
and disappearances.
Gerard Gourgue, minister of justice and one of five members of the
National Council that succeeded President-for-Life Jean-Claude
Duvalier, said that the official's departure was "shocking and offends
public opinion."
The police official, Col. Albert Pierre, left Sunday en route to Panama
and eventual exile in Brazil. Pierre, Duvalier's police chief in Port-au-
Prince, left the Brazilian embassy, where he had taken refuge, and was
flown out of the country with the permission and cooperation of the new
government.
Meanwhile, Duvalier yesterday became the subject of an eviction or
der sought by his reluctant French landlord.
Ousted in a popular rebellion after being abandoned by the Reagan
Administration, the former Haitian dictator has spent the last 18 days
closeted in a luxury hotel in the French lakeside resort of Talloires. His
stay, which was originally limited to a week, has been prolonged from
day to day as France and the United States continue their search for a
country willing to accept him permanently.
, Yesterday the owner of the Hotel de 1' Abbaye in Talloires, which was
requisitioned by the French government to provide accommodation for
Duvalier and his family, announced that he had asked a French court to
evict the former Haitian dictator.
Thatcher compromises with N. Irish
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher extended an olive
branch yesterday to leaders of Northern Ireland's largely Protestant un
ionist community, hoping to defuse growing tension and plans for a
protest strike in the province Monday.
Unionist leaders James Molyneaux and lan Paisley promised only to
"reflect" on her offer to set up new mechanisms to consult with them
more closely on Northern Ireland affairs. But following the 90-minute
meeting with Thatcher, they appeared to draw back from the brink of
outright confrontation with the British government over November's
Anglo-Irish accord giving the Republic of Ireland to the south a voice in
the province's affairs on behalf of its minority Catholic community.
For its part, the government responded favorably to a unionist pro
posal to hold a roundtable conference among the main Northern Ireland
parties to discuss increased "devolution," or home rule, in the province.
They agreed to meet again shortly.
Roman Catholic and centrist leaders and the Dublin government
welcomed the developments.
Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King hailed yesterday's talks as
"suddenly, a chance to look afresh at a range of opportunities."
Both Thatcher and the unionists insisted that any new arrangement
between them would not affect their diametrically opposed positions on
the peace-keeping agreement signed last November between London
and Dublin. The agreement set up an intergovernmental body between
the two for regular meetings on the adminstration of Northern Ireland.
