# U.S. shifts hopes to Aquino
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration
quickly transferred its hopes and official recogni
tion yesterday from Ferdinand Marcos to Corazon
Aquino, declaring that her new Philippine govern
ment "has been produced by one of the most stir
ring and courageous examples of the democratic
process in modern history."
A White House statement, read by Secretary of
State George Shultz several hours after Marcos was
lifted away from his palace by U.S. helicopters, set
the celebratory tone of the transition in official
Washington, which had played a key role in the
tumultuous events of recent weeks.
"This has not been something that the United
States has done. This is something that the people
of the Philippines have done. .. . We honor them
for this outpouring of democracy," said Shultz in a
commment echoed by many other officials.
Shultz said the United States stands ready to aid
Aquino in tackling the immense economic and se
curity problems of an important U.S. ally in Asia.
Other State and Defense department officials
seemed to promote increased U.S. assistance on
grounds that the Aquino government could use it
with greater effectiveness than Marcos' regime
could.
The early soundings from Capitol Hill indicated
broad approval of the change in Manila and wil
lingness to consider expanded aid to nurture the
new government. Congressional dismay over fraud
by Marcos forces in the Feb. 7 election had
generated a drive on Capitol Hill to cut off U.S. aid
as long as Marcos remained in power.

"The absence of Marcos isn't going to solve the
problems by itself, but you couldn't solve the prob
lems as long as he was there," said a senior Admin
istration official, who cautioned that the troubles of
the Philippines are imposing and that the Aquino
government is untested.
"There are going to be big problems ahead in the
Philippines," said a senior State Department offi
cial in a briefing for reporters late yesterday. The
United States believed, the official added, that
"only a government that enjoyed a genuine

popular mandate could effectively address them.
Aquino's government does enjoy that kind of
mandate. This is why we recognized that govern
ment promptly this morning."
Officials expressed approval of Aquino's initial
moves, including her first Cabinet and central bank
appointments and her apparent rejection of
retribution against Marcos supporters.
There was also guarded optimism that Aquino
and her associates will come to see the value of an
enduring U.S. presence at Clark Field and Subic
Bay Naval Base, which are the largest American
military bases abroad. Aquino has said that she ac
cepts the agreement under which the United States
retains use of these bases at least through 1991.
Explaining the U.S. stand on Marcos' future,
Shultz said at the White House early yesterday that
"President Marcos is welcome to come to the
United States." This assurance, which was given
privately to Marcos before he left Manila, is
thought to have been a factor in his decision to sur
render power.
"We've offered him safe haven. . . . We've of
fered him our hospitality," said a senior State De
partment official at yesterday afternoon's briefing.
He declined to further define Marcos' legal status
in the United States.
While there is no indication that the Aquino gov
ernment will seek to extradite Marcos or those who
departed from Manila with him, the State Depart
ment official noted that an extradition treaty with
the Philippines has been signed but has not been
ratified.
