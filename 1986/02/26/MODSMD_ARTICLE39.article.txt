# Engineers sought to delay launch

### 
WASHINGTON — In testimony
charged with emotion, engineers for
the company that builds space shuttle
rockets said yesterday that they
waged a desperate, losing struggle
during the night before the ill-fated
Challenger flight to persuade space
agency officials and their own super
visors that launching in the bitter cold
weather would risk catastrophe.
The engineers, testifying in arrest
ing detail before a presidential com
mission investigating the Jan. 28 dis
aster, described how their arguments
were stymied by National
Aeronautics and Space Administra

tion (NASA) officials and by hasty
reinterpretations of data by their own
superiors at Morton Thiokol Inc.
And their accounts revealed that
the tragic chain of events believed
most likely to have destroyed the
Challenger was foretold — in star
tlingly clear terms — by top rocket
experts the night before launch.
"I made the direct statement that if
anything happened to this launch . . .
I sure wouldn't want to be the person
who had to stand in front of a board
of inquiry to explain why I launched
this. . . recalled Allan McDonald, a
26-year Morton Thiokol engineer

who was the company's top represen
tative at Kennedy Space Center for
the Challenger flight.
"When I made that statement, no
one commented about it," McDonald
told the panel in the first of two days
of public hearings. The second
hearing is scheduled for today.
The four Morton Thiokol en
gineers who testified yesterday
accused NASA of forcing Morton
Thiokol into the unprecedented posi
tion of having to prove that the
launch would be dangerous — a
departure from the space agency's
historic stance that contractors dem

onstrate why a mission was safe.
Their testimony, along with that of
three company executives, also
yielded the startling vision of deci
sions that involved the safety of seven
crew members being made in disre
gard or ignorance of NASA launch
standards.
More than a dozen ranking NASA
officials were in the audience at the
session, but left without commenting
on the testimony. Space agency
propulsion experts who took part in
the pre-launch discussions with Mor
ton Thiokol are expected to testify
today.
