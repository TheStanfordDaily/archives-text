# Aerobics for fun — but not profit

Free. To Stanford students, who
pay one of the highest college tui
tions in the nation, this word has a
special appeal.
Senior Glen Lagerstrom has dis
covered just how great this appeal
is. He says every week, about 400-
450 Reebok-clad students migrate
over to the Elliot Program Center
to participate in his free aerobic
classes.

Called the "Jane Stanford
Workout" as a farce on America's
video aerobic queen, actress Jane
Fonda, these popular one-hour
classes have been offered daily at
3:30 and 4:30 p.m. since Septem
ber.
While off-campus aerobic
studios, like " Reach" in Palo Alto,
pay their instructors up to $25 or
$30 a class, Lagerstrom coordi
nates the Stanford program for
free.
"1 wanted to have a program on
campus that anybody could come
to, and I think that's what we have
achieved," he explained.

"Although it doesn't seem that
much — say, $25 to $30 a quar
ter" to join a pay aerobics pro
gram, "that's still $25 to $30 more
than a lot of students can afford."
The Jane Stanford Workout is
currently operating with five in
structors teaching two to three
classes a week.
"It's an incredible commit
ment," said Lagerstrom of the
volunteer efforts of his staff.
"People really downplayed the
idea, saying that it would never
work and that no one would ever
volunteer this much time, but it is
really working," he said.
Lagerstrom stopped out last
year and began working out and
teaching aerobic classes, at times
up to 14 per week. When he
returned to Stanford this fall, he
scheduled three classes a week,
figuring he could work three hours
of aerobic instruction into his
schedule.
After the first week, he was ap
proached by two students also in
terested in teaching classes, and
the program has offered a 4:30
class every day since.
