# Aerobics for fun — but not profit

### MAUREEN MORAN 
Free. To Stanford students, who
pay one of the highest college tui
tions in the nation, this word has a
special appeal.
Senior Glen Lagerstrom has dis
covered just how great this appeal
is. He says every week, about 400-
450 Reebok-clad students migrate
over to the Elliot Program Center
to participate in his free aerobic
classes.

Feature

Called the "Jane Stanford
Workout" as a farce on America's
video aerobic queen, actress Jane
Fonda, these popular one-hour
classes have been offered daily at
3:30 and 4:30 p.m. since Septem
ber.
While off-campus aerobic
studios, like " Reach" in Palo Alto,
pay their instructors up to $25 or
$30 a class, Lagerstrom coordi
nates the Stanford program for
free.
"1 wanted to have a program on
campus that anybody could come
to, and I think that's what we have
achieved," he explained.

"Although it doesn't seem that
much — say, $25 to $30 a quar
ter" to join a pay aerobics pro
gram, "that's still $25 to $30 more
than a lot of students can afford."
The Jane Stanford Workout is
currently operating with five in
structors teaching two to three
classes a week.
"It's an incredible commit
ment," said Lagerstrom of the
volunteer efforts of his staff.
"People really downplayed the
idea, saying that it would never
work and that no one would ever
volunteer this much time, but it is
really working," he said.
Lagerstrom stopped out last
year and began working out and
teaching aerobic classes, at times
up to 14 per week. When he
returned to Stanford this fall, he
scheduled three classes a week,
figuring he could work three hours
of aerobic instruction into his
schedule.
After the first week, he was ap
proached by two students also in
terested in teaching classes, and
the program has offered a 4:30
class every day since.
The classes are held in the Elliot
Program Center's Dance Studio,
which, according to Lagerstrom, is
perfect for aerobicizing.
Since the Jane Stanford Workout is
a non-profit, student-run organiza
tion, it has priority over almost all
other groups wishing to use the
facility. Lagerstrom's status as a resi
dent assistant (RA) in Adams House
also increased the aerobic program's
priority points.
Saying the dance studio has "the
best floor on campus" because it
"gives with the impact of aerobic ex
ercise" Lagerstrom also elaborated

on his commitment to safety.
"My philosophy on aerobics is that
it should be safe and then it should be
fun," he said.
As a standard format, each class in
cludes an extensive stretch segment, a
20- to 25-minute run with pulse
checks, toning exercises for the arms,
waist, thighs and abdomen, and a
"cool down" stretch to finish the
workout.
However, Lagerstrom explained
that although each class is concerned
with safety and follows this typical
format, there are differences between
the teachers themselves.
"I know from hearing comments
from students that there are some
real discrepancies between the teach
ing styles," he said, adding that the

differences in music and exercise
routines make for a more diverse and
less routine workout.
By the looks of the growing class
sizes, some Stanford students seem to
think the classes are both a great bar
gain and a great workout. As of late,
both classes have consistently filled
up to capacity every day, causing
Lagerstrom and his staff to organize
some new classes to be offered in the
morning.
Summarizing why many students
take advantage of the Jane Stanford
Workout, senior Maria Hart gave her
reasons for regularly participating in
the classes.
"It's a convenient place and time,
it's a good workout — and best of all
— it's free," she said.
