Court upholds zoning
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, up
holding the far-ranging use of municipal zoning
power, ruled yesterday that local communities
may relegate adult movie theaters to isolated
areas to combat the spread of crime, congestion
and economic decline.
In a 7-2 decision, the justices approved an or
dinance enacted in Renton, Wash., that was de
signed to keep adult movie houses away from
schools, churches and residential areas by re
stricting them to a largely vacant site that theater
owners called an "industrial wasteland."
The ordinance does not violate the right to free
expression because it still permits a "reasonable
opportunity" to operate an ac'ult establishment
within city limits, the court said.
"The Renton ordinance represents a valid
governmental response to the admittedly serious
problems created by adult theaters," Justice
William Rehnquist wrote for the majority.
"Renton has not used the power to zone as a
pretext for suppressing expression, but rather has
sought to make some areas available for adult
theaters and their patrons, while at the same time
preserving the quality of life in the community at
.large."

The decision came as a significant victory for
wide-ranging coalition of governmental groups
and officials that had joined Renton authorities
in asking the justices to overturn a ruling by a
federal appeals court in San Francisco holding
the ordinance unconstitutional. The Supreme
Court's decision applies by implication to
bookstores and other businesses that sell sexually
explicit material.
Retail prices rise slightly
WASHINGTON — Retail prices increased
only 0.3 percent in January, ending a brief three
month flirtation with higher inflation at 1985's
end and reflecting the first impact of the sharp
drop in crude oil prices that began at the end of
last year, the government reported yesterday.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the in
flation rate, which had reached as high as 0.6 per
cent last November, had reverted to the same
average monthly rate of advance that has
prevailed since late 1981, when an era of high in
flation came to a sudden close.
Economists attributed the inflationary burst of
late 1985 to one-time increases in food and en
ergy prices. In fact, they expressed surprise that

the collapse of world crude oil prices did not have
a greater impact in January and predicted lower
— even negative — inflation into the spring.
"We expect to see much more of the gasoline
decline," said Dorothea Otte of the economic
forecasting project at Georgia State University.
She predicted that the consumer price index may
decline by as much as 0.4 percent in February,
and for all of 1986 the forecasting project sees in
flation as low as 2.8 percent, a level unmatched
since the late 19605.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that retail
prices for gasoline at the pump actually declined
in January, although they recorded a 0.1 percent
increase after seasonal adjustments.
Stock prices decline
NEW YORK — Stock prices declined in active
trading yesterday, as investors took profits from
the market's latest gains and news of strengthen
ing in some oil prices depressed a number of is
sues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 5.62 points to 1,692.66, while losers and
gainers were virtually even on the New York
Stock Exchange.
