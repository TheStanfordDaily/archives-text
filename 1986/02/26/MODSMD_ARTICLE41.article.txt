Bradley annouces bid
SACRAMENTO — Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley yesterday began his second try to
become the first black governor of California,
declaring, "California doesn't need a governor
who is a caretaker for the rich and privileged."
Sharply attacking his opponent, Republican
Gov. George Deukmejian, Bradley struck a
decidedly populist note in a speech before sup
porters in the lobby of Sacramento's old Senator
Hotel, once the hangout of powerful old-boy lob
byists and now an office building.
Bradley, during a private session with law
makers in the Assembly lounge, gave a speech
that Democratic Speaker Willie Brown, Jr. said
did much to heal the differences between Bradley
and Democratic lawmakers that had hurt his
1982 race against Deukmejian.
"We are part of the operation," Brown said in
an interview. "He has asked for our support.
That did not happen in 1982."
Bradley continued a major theme of his attack
against Deukmejian, saying that he has failed to
crack down on toxic polluters. "Yes, we can have
a governor who owes his allegiance to all of the
people and not to a handful of toxic polluters,"
Bradley said.
Runoff in San Diego
SAN DIEGO — Maureen O'Connor and City
Councilman Bill Cleator were forced into a

mayoral runoff yesterday v.hen O'Connor fell
short of capturing the 51 percent of the votes that
were needed to put her in office.
With 100 percent of the city's 838 precincts
reporting in yesterday's special election,
O'Connor had 80,861 votes, or 46 percent, and
Cleator had 52,940 votes, or 30 percent. Former
city councilman Floyd Morrow captured 19 per
cent of the votes, or 33,559.
It was the fifth time since 1983 that San Diego
voters have gone to the polls to select a new
mayor.
Estimated turnout exceeded the registrar of
voters' prediction that fewer than 30 percent of
the city's 485,000 voters would cast ballots in the
special election to pick a successor to Roger
Hedgecock, who resigned following conviction
on conspiracy and perjury charges.
H-P announces plans
PALO ALTO — Hewlett-Packard Co. bet
hundreds of millions of dollars designing a new
technology for business computers, a gamble that
enthusiastic industry analysts said yesterday
could make the company a big winner.
The new design, named H-P Precision Archi
tecture, will be the foundation for all of the com
pany's major computers "well into the next de
cade," said H-P President John Young.
The importance of the technology and several
new products to the company was underscored
by the rare appearance of company founder and

chairman David Packard.
The five-year effort by over 1,000 H-P re
searchers, he said, "is a real contribution in an
historical perspective" to the company and the
industry.
Suspect pleads innocent
PASADENA — The son of a Filipino news ex
ecutive pleaded innocent yesterday to killing his
father and using the political turmoil in the
Philippines to cover up the slaying.
A commissioner said he will decide next month
if Arnel Salvatierra, 17, should be tried as an
adult in the shooting death of Oscar Salvatierra,
41.
The youth, a slight figure with short hair, ap
peared at the hearing in a gray sweatshirt, jeans
and tennis shoes. He is charged with a single
murder count.
Later yesterday, prosecutors charged his
girlfriend, Teressa Kay Deburger, 18, with being
an accessory to murder, said Los Angeles County
district attorney's spokesman A 1 Albergate.
Sunny, says Troy
According to our weatherman, Troy Eid, today
will be sunny, except for areas of dense fog in the
morning. But even with highs in the 70s, he'd still
rather be in Colorado.
