## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
Members of the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity met yesterday with Univer
sity officials to discuss solving behav
ioral and financial problems outlined
in a January letter from Residential
Education.
"Basically, the purpose was to dis
cuss the contents of my Jan. 29 letter
to [the fraternity]," said Diana Con
klin, assistant dean of Student Affairs
and director of the Row. The letter
asked the Theta Delts why they
"should keep (their) house, given the
several incidents that have happened
in the last nine months," Conklin
said.
Conklin's letter also detailed be

havioral problems including
"extraordinary destructiveness" to
the house and "serious fire and safety
hazards in the house."
Conklin said she posed "four
central questions" to the Theta Delt
officers at the meeting.
"The first was how they will convey
who they are and what the fraternity
is about to potential members during
rush week. The second question was
how they will decide upon and convey
their behavioral expectations of their
members," Conklin said.
"The third was what judicial mech
anism will exist in the (Theta Delt)
house to insure that behavioral ex
pectations are met by the members,"
Conklin said.

The fourth question asked for a fi
nancial plan detailing how the Theta
Delts will clear their debts, said Con
klin, whose letter said the fraternity
had a $29,113 debt as of Jan. 6.
The Theta Delts must answer the
four questions by Dead Week of this
quarter, according to Conklin, who
did not mention disciplinary action
the University would take against the
fraternity.
The Theta Delts will hold a house
meeting later this week to discuss
answers to Conklin's questions, ac
cording to fraternity President Jim
Flanigon.
"We're going to work at it,"
Flanigon said. "We hope it will work
out OK."

Flanigon said Theta Delt members
will "play a big part" in solving the
fraternity's problems. "We have the
cooperation of the whole house be
hind us, which we will need," he said.
"The meeting went very well," said
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano,
who attended yesterday's meeting.
"The (fraternity's) newly elected
officers have some good ideas on how
to solve the problems," he said. "And
some you can't just resolve in a
meeting, for example the debt."
"The meeting brought together all
who can best come up with a solution
to the problems and work together,"
Pisano said.
Asked how he perceives the Theta
Delts' current reputation, Flanigon
declined to comment.
