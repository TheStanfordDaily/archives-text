# Forum to address issue of racism
## 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Senior staff writer 
Concern over a relaxation of attitudes toward
racism at Stanford has prompted a coalition of
members of minority and self-defined progressive
student organizations to plan a forum aimed at ex
ploring ways to identify and stop racism.
The forum, which is to include a panel presenta
tion by a keynote speaker, students, faculty and
staff representatives and a representative from
United Stanford Workers (USW), will take place
Thursday at 7 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

Small group discussions facilitated by coalition
members will follow.
The forum is the first step in an anti-racism cam
paign that will include discussions based in the
residences, forum planners said.
Members of the planning committee stress that
the forum is designed to educate people and not to
"point fingers" at members of the community.
They say speakers will address individual aware
ness of racism, Stanford as an institution, institu
tions at Stanford, racism in the United States and
racism as an international issue.
"The forum is geared toward heightening aware

ness of, interest in and sensitivity toward racism, so
that the campus may more effectively approach the
issue in the months and years to come," said coali
tion members in a statement. The coalition includes
members of the Asian American Students Associ
ation, Black Student Union, Movimicnto Estudian
til de Azatlan, Stanford African Students Associa
tion, Stanford American Indian Organization,
Stanford Central American Action Network and
Stanford Out of South Africa.
According to Caroline Paul, a planning commit-
tee member, "It's not accusatory. But
at the same time none of us are
(immune). We're all entangled, and
the important thing is to understand
just how entangled we are, and how
to deal with it." She said racism is a
chronic problem throughout society
— one that affects all members of the
Stanford community.
Donna Anderson, another commit
tee member, said the idea for a forum
came about not in response to a single

act of racism, but due to a concern
about the perceived increase of such
incidents. "There are generally
checks and balances on those atti
tudes that must be breaking down,"
leading to the increase of incidents
and the acceptance of them, she said.
Anderson said the forum will pro
vide people with "different
minority/progressive perspectives as
they affect everybody." She cited the
following incidents as examples:
• The destruction of the shantytown
in White Plaza two weeks ago.
• An announcement placed in The
Daily's Once Around the Ouad

saying, "White Supremists: COP Of
fice, 4 p.m. Bring hoods."
• Fraternity pledges dressed in
breech cloths performing a mock rain
dance in Old Union plaza outside the
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion's office.
• Fourteen Stanford football players
at Big Game wearing stickers of a
native American on their helmets.
• A recent fraternity party flier
depicting Buckwheat from the televi
sion program, "The Little Rascals,"
saying, "Now dat's a party."
• Headlines in recent Daily articles
such as a review for Yuen Yung Res
taurant titled "The name's a bit funny

but humor stops there," and an arti
cle about a visiting dance troupe
titled "Chinese troupe invades
Farm."
• The existence of and student sup
port for events such as kamikaze and
south-of-the-border parties.
"The focus is not on the incidents
themselves, but on the relaxation of
attitudes toward racism as a serious
issue," Anderson said, adding that "it
definitely is a chronic problem. It's
nothing that we see as sudden, abrupt
or frightening," Anderson said.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said in a press release, "I'm dis

turbed by these incidents but I do not
believe they constitute a sudden and
dramatic increase," adding, "I am al
ways concerned by such events
whenever they occur. Continued ex
amination by this community of itself
and its performance in this matter is
highly desirable."
Anderson said," 'If I don't mean it
(to be racist), it's not a problem,' is a
questionable, insensitive and un
aware stance," Anderson said. "Look
around you. If you can't see it
(racism), come to the forum. If you
have seen it, come share. ... It (the
forum) can't happen without all of
us," she said.
