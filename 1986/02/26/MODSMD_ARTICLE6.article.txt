Concern over a relaxation of attitudes toward
racism at Stanford has prompted a coalition of
members of minority and self-defined progressive

The forum, which is to include a panel presenta

staff representatives and a representative from
United Stanford Workers (USW), will take place
Thursday at 7 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

Small group discussions facilitated by coalition
members will follow.
The forum is the first step in an anti-racism cam

residences, forum planners said.
Members of the planning committee stress that
the forum is designed to educate people and not to
"point fingers" at members of the community.
They say speakers will address individual aware

racism as an international issue.
"The forum is geared toward heightening aware

that the campus may more effectively approach the
issue in the months and years to come," said coali

members of the Asian American Students Associ

Stanford Central American Action Network and
Stanford Out of South Africa.
