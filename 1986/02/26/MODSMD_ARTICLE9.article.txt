### FELICIA PAIK Staff writer 
In a move aimed at coordinating Latino
scholarship across the nation, the University
yesterday officially recognized the Inter-
University Program for Latino Research (lUP),
a national consortium of university research
centers headquartered at Stanford's Center for
Chicano Research.
The program focuses on "interdisciplinary
collaborative and comparative Hispanic re
search," according to Albert Camarillo, assis
tant history professor and director of lUP.
"This is really the first time that Puerto Rican
and Mexican-American scholars have worked
together in this way. . . . For the most part,
Latino scholars have worked in isolation,"
Camarillo told University News Service.
lUP will examine such topics as Latino voting
patterns, the impact of the changing U.S. eco
nomy on Latinos and Latino literacy programs.
Camarillo is the principal investigator of the
economic project. Other Stanford participants
include Donald Harris, professor of economics,
and Raul Hinojosa, research associate at the
Food Research Institute.

The program grew from the Stanford Center
of Chicano Research, which was established in
1980 to conduct research on urban Chicanos.
In addition to the Center for Chicano Re
search, participants in the program include: the
Center for Mexican-American Studies at the
University of Texas; the Chicano Studies Re
search Center at the University of California at
Los Angeles and the Centro de Estudios Puer
torriquenos at Hunter College in New York.
Scholars hope to establish a working relation
ship between themselves and those in the public
policy arena to promote a collaborative spirit,
Camarillo said.
In additional to its own projects, lUP has co
sponsored a research competition with the So
cial Science Research Council of New York.
The competition is supporting 17 projects with
funding from the Ford Foundation, according to
Peggy Estrada, assistant director of lUP.
The projects' topics include Hispanic and
Puerto Rican immigration, ethnicity, political
participation and employment security.
"Latino and non-Latino scholars who are
concerned with the quality of life of Hispanics
will be involved in the program," Estrada said.
