# AIDS Update
## 
### 
There are few, if any, in
stances in the history of
medicine in which the only
way to treat a health problem
is by education. Such is the
case with AIDS. Where are the
magic bullets and the vaccines
we have come to rely on?
When it comes to AIDS, the
only treatment is education.
And the education is specific.
It focuses on what to do to
avoid catching and transmit
ting the virus. The Fall issue of
The Student Body was devoted
to AIDS education and is
available in the waiting area at
Cowell if you missed it.
We, at Cowell, hope to keep
you up-to-date in new
developments about AIDS.
Recent information. . . .
• A new study has confirmed
that, as suspected, condoms
provide an effective barrier to
the AIDS virus [reported in
Medical World News, January
27, 1986]. When used cor
rectly, condoms should
prevent the transmission of
the infection. For more
protection, the use of sper
micidal foam in conjunction
with condoms is optimal.
• Researchers at Massachu
setts General Hospital at
tempted to isolate the AIDS
virus from saliva samples of
men who were positive carries
of the virus. While they were
able to detect the virus in 28 to
50 blood cultures, only one of
the 83 saliva specimens tested
positive for the virus. This in
dicates that infection from
saliva is not an efficient meet
hod to transmit the virus
[reported in The New England
Journal of Medicine (NEJM),
December 19,1985].
• Contrary to recent concerns
expressed by the military,
there is virtually no evidence
of AIDS being transmitted by
casual contact. A study of 101
household contacts of AIDS
patients showed only one 5-
year old child with a positive
test for the AIDS antibody (in
the NEJM, February 6, 1986).
The infection in this child was
thought to have been ac
quired at birth. The authors
concluded that there was little
or no risk of transmission of
the AIDS virus from
household contact.
