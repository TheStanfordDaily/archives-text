# AIDS Update
## 
### 
There are few, if any, in
stances in the history of
medicine in which the only
way to treat a health problem
is by education. Such is the
case with AIDS. Where are the
magic bullets and the vaccines
we have come to rely on?
When it comes to AIDS, the
only treatment is education.
And the education is specific.
It focuses on what to do to
avoid catching and transmit
ting the virus. The Fall issue of
The Student Body was devoted
to AIDS education and is
available in the waiting area at
Cowell if you missed it.
We, at Cowell, hope to keep
you up-to-date in new
developments about AIDS.
Recent information. . . .
• A new study has confirmed
that, as suspected, condoms
provide an effective barrier to
the AIDS virus [reported in
Medical World News, January
27, 1986]. When used cor
rectly, condoms should
prevent the transmission of
the infection. For more
protection, the use of sper
micidal foam in conjunction
with condoms is optimal.
• Researchers at Massachu
setts General Hospital at
tempted to isolate the AIDS
virus from saliva samples of
men who were positive carries
of the virus. While they were
able to detect the virus in 28 to
50 blood cultures, only one of
the 83 saliva specimens tested
positive for the virus. This in
dicates that infection from
saliva is not an efficient meet
hod to transmit the virus
[reported in The New England
Journal of Medicine (NEJM),
December 19,1985].
• Contrary to recent concerns
expressed by the military,
there is virtually no evidence
of AIDS being transmitted by
casual contact. A study of 101
household contacts of AIDS
patients showed only one 5-
year old child with a positive
test for the AIDS antibody (in
the NEJM, February 6, 1986).
The infection in this child was
thought to have been ac
quired at birth. The authors
concluded that there was little
or no risk of transmission of
the AIDS virus from
household contact.

Concern continues about
the spread of the virus into the
heterosexual community.
Women are at risk if they have
intercourse with bisexual men
or with I.V. drug users. Heter
osexual men are at risk from
sexual contact with women
who may be asymptomatic
carriers from previous sexual
contacts or with female I.V.
drug users. Prostitutes are a
particularly high risk group
since they are often members
of both risk categories.
How high is this risk? Auth
orities differ. Dr. Paul Vol
berding recently reported at
Stanford that "there is no
evidence that heterosexual
spread is occurring in any
great frequency in this
country." In a recent letter to
the Journal of the American
Medical Association, a Johns
Hopkins physician argued that

the virus "seldom if ever"
moved from an infected
woman to a man in vaginal in
tercourse.
However, in Africa the virus
has already spread extensively
into the general population,
infecting 14 percent of healthy
men and nine percent of
healthy women in one study,
plus 80 percent of the pros
titute population. Although
female to male transmission
has been identified less fre
quently than male to female in
the United States, the Califor
nia State Department of
Health states that "it seems
prudent to assume that female
to male transmission does oc
cur."
The incubation period —
the time from exposure to the
AIDS virus to the development
of symptoms — is now felt to
be up to seven years or more.
During this time an individual
may be in the carrier state:

contagious, but experiencing
no symptoms. This highlights
the importance of using
"safer" sexual practices with a
partner with whom you have
not been mutually
monogamous for the past
seven years.
Questions about testing for
the AIDS antibody have been
raised in relation to the
recording of results in the
medical record. For individ
uals who do take the test,
results are kept confidential
and are not included in the
Cowell Medical Chart.
Students with concerns
about AIDS or interested in in
formation about "safe" sex
practices are encouraged to
contact a Cowell health practi
tioner (723-4841), the San Fran
cisco AIDS Foundation
(863-AIDS), or the Cay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) (723-1488).

case with AIDS. Where are the
magic bullets and the vaccines
we have come to rely on?
When it comes to AIDS, the
only treatment is education.
And the education is specific.
It focuses on what to do to
avoid catching and transmit
ting the virus. The Fall issue of
The Student Body was devoted
to AIDS education and is
available in the waiting area at
Cowell if you missed it.
We, at Cowell, hope to keep
you up-to-date in new
developments about AIDS.
Recent information. . . .
• A new study has confirmed
that, as suspected, condoms
provide an effective barrier to
the AIDS virus [reported in
Medical World News, January
27, 1986]. When used cor
rectly, condoms should
prevent the transmission of
the infection. For more
protection, the use of sper
micidal foam in conjunction
with condoms is optimal.
• Researchers at Massachu
setts General Hospital at
tempted to isolate the AIDS
virus from saliva samples of
men who were positive carries
of the virus. While they were
able to detect the virus in 28 to
50 blood cultures, only one of
the 83 saliva specimens tested
positive for the virus. This in
dicates that infection from
saliva is not an efficient meet
hod to transmit the virus
[reported in The New England
Journal of Medicine (NEJM),
December 19,1985].
• Contrary to recent concerns
expressed by the military,
there is virtually no evidence
of AIDS being transmitted by
casual contact. A study of 101
household contacts of AIDS
patients showed only one 5-
year old child with a positive
test for the AIDS antibody (in
the NEJM, February 6, 1986).
The infection in this child was
thought to have been ac
quired at birth. The authors
concluded that there was little
or no risk of transmission of
the AIDS virus from
household contact.

Concern continues about
the spread of the virus into the
heterosexual community.
Women are at risk if they have
intercourse with bisexual men
or with I.V. drug users. Heter
osexual men are at risk from
sexual contact with women
who may be asymptomatic
carriers from previous sexual
contacts or with female I.V.
drug users. Prostitutes are a
particularly high risk group
since they are often members
of both risk categories.
How high is this risk? Auth
orities differ. Dr. Paul Vol
berding recently reported at
Stanford that "there is no
evidence that heterosexual
spread is occurring in any
great frequency in this
country." In a recent letter to
the Journal of the American
Medical Association, a Johns
Hopkins physician argued that

the virus "seldom if ever"
moved from an infected
woman to a man in vaginal in
tercourse.
However, in Africa the virus
has already spread extensively
into the general population,
infecting 14 percent of healthy
men and nine percent of
healthy women in one study,
plus 80 percent of the pros
titute population. Although
female to male transmission
has been identified less fre
quently than male to female in
the United States, the Califor
nia State Department of
Health states that "it seems
prudent to assume that female
to male transmission does oc
cur."
The incubation period —
the time from exposure to the
AIDS virus to the development
of symptoms — is now felt to
be up to seven years or more.
During this time an individual
may be in the carrier state:

contagious, but experiencing
no symptoms. This highlights
the importance of using
"safer" sexual practices with a
partner with whom you have
not been mutually
monogamous for the past
seven years.
Questions about testing for
the AIDS antibody have been
raised in relation to the
recording of results in the
medical record. For individ
uals who do take the test,
results are kept confidential
and are not included in the
Cowell Medical Chart.
Students with concerns
about AIDS or interested in in
formation about "safe" sex
practices are encouraged to
contact a Cowell health practi
tioner (723-4841), the San Fran
cisco AIDS Foundation
(863-AIDS), or the Cay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) (723-1488).
