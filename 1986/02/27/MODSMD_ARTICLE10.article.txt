## Women and missed periods

Most college age women
have missed an occasional
menstrual period. Many
things can contribute to this,
but the first consideration is
always pregnancy. After that
possibility has been ruled out,
when should a woman be con
cerned about irregular
menstrual cycles? When
should she seek out medical
care?
Secondary amenorrhea is
the absence of three con
secutive cycles or six months
of no menstrual bleeding in
women who have
menstruated. Secondary
amenorrhea occurs in approx
imately five percent of women
in the general population.
There is an increased preva
lence in women who exercise
regularly, particularly athletes
who train vigorously. This
prevalence varies with the

Recent studies have shown
that women athletes who have
lower body fat also have a
higher incidence of amenor
rhea. The higher the activity
level of exercise (such as the
mileage of a female runner),
the lower the body fat and the
greater the incidence of
amenorrhea. This condition is
more common in women un
der 115 lbs. and in those who
lose 10 or more pounds. Emo
tional stress is another contri
buting factor.
When a woman is on birth
control pills it is not uncom
mon to miss occasional
menstrual periods because of
the low level of hormone in
the pill. If two or more periods
on the pill are missed, she
should consult her health care
practitioner to determine if
there is a possibility of preg
nancy and whether she should
change the pill she is on.
After discontinuing birth

control pills, some women
may not menstruate for
several months. Certainly, if
six months have passed with
out a period a health practi
tioner should be consulted.
Even without regular periods,
it is possible to ovulate; remem
ber, ovulation precedes
menstruation by two weeks.
Therefore, the use of contracep
tive methods in women who are
sexually active (having inter
course) but not having periods is
essential.
Some women are at risk for
calcium loss and weakening of
the bones if they have
amenorrhea, making them
more susceptible to stress
fractures. All women are en
couraged to maintain an ade
quate calcium intake of 800 to
1200 mg of calcium a day.

or not you are obtaining ade
