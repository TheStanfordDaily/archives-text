# Morning after pill
## 
### 
Contraceptives aren't per
fect. Even when used cor
rectly, failures can occur:
condoms break, diaphragms
become dislodged, and IUDs
fall out. People, also, aren't
perfect. Some people are so
uncomfortable with sex that
they would rather be "swept
away" than stopping to use
contraception. At other times,
inclination and opportunity
unexpectedly converge. In ad
dition, rape occurs. While not
desirable all these reasons
may make the "morning-after
pill" the treatment of choice.
Historically, many tech
niques have tried to avoid
pregnancy, including douch
ing, wiping out the vagina with
the fingers, moving the body
violently to expel the semen,
coughing, sneezing, jumping
backwards suddenly, and the
postcoital placing of pepper,
cabbage blossoms, and seeds
into the vagina.
Today, the administration of
estrogens in large doses has
been found to be highly effec
tive in preventing pregnancy
following unprotected inter
course. Treatment must be
started within 72 hours. Less
than one percent of the
women treated in this manner
go on to become pregnant.
With no treatment five to 30
percent of women will
become pregnant following
single unprotected midcycle
intercourse. Still more
become pregnant with
repeated, unprotected inter
course.
Estrogen, used in this way,
presumably alters the recep
tivity of the endometrium
(lining of the uterus) to a fer
tilized egg. By preventing the
implantation of the egg, a
pregnancy is forestalled. If im

plantation is already estab
lished before estrogen is
taken, the drug will not
produce abortion. However,
since fertilization can occur,
the estrogen may technically
cause an early abortion by pre
venting implantation (similar
to an lUD).
Several estrogen forms are
effective. The drug most often
recommended in the past has
been ethinyl estradiol five mil
ligrams per day, taken by
mouth for 5 days. This
represents a daily dose equiva
lent to about 70 birth control
pills over a five day period of
time. Obviously, such doses
should not be relied upon for
routine contraception.
Recent use of four birth
control pills (Ovral) taken over
a 12 hour period has been
compared favorably with the
previous approach (98.4 per
cent effective) and has caused
fewer adverse side effects.
There is no clear evidence
whether this treatment is
harmful either to the woman
or to the fetus, if pill does not
prevent implanatation or, if
the woman is already pregnant
or implantation is not
prevented.
The Morning-After Pill
should not be prescribed for
women with evidence of
breast or genital tumors, or to
women with any medical con
traindications to regular birth
control pills.
Because repeated use of
estrogen for post-coital con
traception is a poor substitute
for planned contraception, all
women are urged to seek con
traceptive advice after use of
the Morning-After Pill. Call
