# The
						blues: winter time, anytime

About this time of year,
many Stanford students begin
to feel emotionally low â€” a re
action sometimes called the
Winter Quarter Blues.
For freshmen, this can fol
low their first trip home for
the holiday. A fresh look at
families, old girlfriends and
boyfriends, or a younger
sibling taking over the
domain, all contribute to a list
less feeling that emerges on
return to school.
For other students simply
being in the middle of the
school year, realizing that it is

only half over, also contri
butes to the blues.
Other sources of this feeling
may include the possibility of
leaving Stanford in the spring,
pressures of career and finan
cial decision-making, or the
complexities of relationships.
Winter quarter blues is an
other term for depression.
But what is depression?
Characterized by low energy,
apathy, feeling down, being
"in the pits" or "bummed
out," it is a time of turning in
ward usually with a sense of
great isolation. It is a mood. It
can be a temporary condition,

or it can be something more
severe and prolonged that
may require professional help
to assure its relief.
Milder moods pass quickly
(moments to hours to days).
Often support from friends
and family is very effective in
alleviating bad feelings. The
more depressed a person
gets, the harder it is to remain
objective. Talking to someone
can help to become more ob
jective by having them point
out a pattern in relationships,
re-evaluate a routine or exam
ine an expectation.
