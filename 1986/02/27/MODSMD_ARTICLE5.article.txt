# Food and weight
## Guidelines for health 
### 
There are few people, who at
one time or another, don't
worry about their weight. Here
are some general guidelines
on the best food to eat to
manage your weight.
Carbohydrates and Your Weight
Contrary to what was
believed complex car
bohydrates should make up
the largest percentage of
foods in your day. Here are
some facts to convince you
that complex carbohydrates
(starches) help your health
and your weight:
• Carbohydrates contain no
more calories than protein,
and less than half the calories
of fat. Foods that are high in
carbohydrates are generally
low in fat, like breads, grains,
pasta, potatoes, fruits and
vegetables. But foods that are
high in protein tend to be high
in fat as well, like meat,
cheese, and whole milk.
• What we put on top of
starchy food poses a much
more serious calorie and
health problem than the
starchy food itself. For exam
ple, adding sour cream to a
baked potato doubles the
calories; butter or margarine
does the same to bread. To
manage your weight it is impor
tant to control the cheese, but
ter, margarine, and sour cream
you put on potatoes, rice or
bread.
• Complex carbohydrates are
the starchy foods, and simple
carbohydrates are the sugars.
Obviously, we are not going
to suggest that you eat more
of the sugars, since they are a
concentrated form of carbohy
drate with little, if any, nutri
tional value. These include
cake, candy, cookies,
sweetened drinks, honey, and
sugar.
• Complex carbohydrate
foods that are minimally pro
cessed are the most desirable
ones. These include foods like

brown rice, whole wheat
bread, potatoes, barley, oats,
and more. Besides the addi
tional vitamins and minerals
found in these whole grain
products, there is also a lot of
fiber.
Fiber
If the average American eats
too much fat, he or she eats
too little fiber. One result of a
low fiber diet is that it takes
more food to fill you up.
Therefore, high fiber foods
play an important role in
weight management, and also
in disease prevention.
Numerous diseases are
thought to be related to low fi
ber diets, including diver
ticular disease, some types of
cancer, and possibly diabetes
and heart disease.
The best way to consume fi
ber (or any other nutrient) is
as food. That is, instead of
eating wheat fiber in the form
of bran, and continuing to eat
highly milled white bread, it
would be better to consume
the bran and the wheat flour
together as whole wheat
bread. Different types of fiber
serve different roles in our
bodies, and as long as we are
eating a varied diet — one
which includes different
fruits, vegetables, grains, and
cereals — we will be getting a
variety of fibers as well.
Below is a list of some high
fiber, complex carbohydrate
food to help you select meals
and snacks that are satisfying,
healthful, and kind to your
shape.
brown rice; baked
potato with skin; rolled
oats; beans, lentils, split
peas; bulgur; whole
grain cereals such as
shredded Wheat, All
Bran; all vegetables;
whole wheat bread or
rolls; bran muffins; rice
cakes; popcorn — not
buttered; bagels —

preferable, whole grain;
whole wheat pretzels
and breaksticks; fruit
(raw is best).
The Role of Fat
Fat is the most concentrated
source of calories in our food.
All kinds of fat — whether
animal fat, vegetable fat,
saturated or polyunsaturated
— contain nine calories per
gram. Compare that to the
four calories contained in a
gram of carbohydrate or
protein, or the seven calories
in a gram of pure alcohol.
We will concentrate on the
fat content of foods, rather
than the caloric content.
There are several reasons for
this:
• Fat is easier to spot than
calories. You can see it, feel it
and taste it.
• High fat intake contributes
to a variety of health prob
lems, including heart disease
and some types of cancer —
not to mention overweight.
It is true that we need some
fat in our diets to maintain
health. But the amount is very
small and Americans, on the
whole, eat far more than is ne

cessary, a habit that is taking
its toll on our health. At most,
30 percent of your daily
calories should come from fat.
That figure includes the fat
that foods naturally contain, as
well as the fat you add as but
ter, cooking oil, etc.
Use the list to help you find
low fat foods to replace the
high-fat ones.
Protein
Most of the high protein
foods eaten in this country are
also high in fat; like beef,
pork, cheese, and lunch
meats. Yet many weight re
duction plans rely heavily on
these foods. The only reason
such plans work (if they do), is
because they exclude carbo
hydrate foods at the same
time, sending the body into an
abnormal metabolic state
called ketosis. Few dieters are
seriously harmed by ketosis,
largely because they don't (or
can't stand to) stick with such
a diet for long. Instead, they
go back to a more balanced
diet, replenishing their bodily
stores and, to their dismay,
gaining back any of the weight
they might have lost.

Sound familiar? Even if it
doesn't, you can be sure that
permanent weight control will
only come with a reasonable
(and gradual) shift away from
high fat foods towards foods
high in complex car
bohydrates and fiber.
But what about the body's
need for protein? Protein is
important to a healthy body,
but that doesn't mean the
more protein you eat, the
healthier you will be. Extra
protein is like any other
foodstuff eaten in excess; if it
isn't burned up as energy or
otherwise used for bodily
functions, it is deposited as
fat. Only 12 percent of your
daily calories should come
from protein. On a 1500
calorie day, that translates to
about 45 grams of protein per
day. On a 1200 calorie day,
that includes about 40 grams
of protein daily.
It's easy to meet your
protein requirements without
large amounts of meat,
cheese, and other fatty foods.
A 3-ounce serving of chicken
or fish (about the size of your
palm) and 3 cups of nonfat
milk or yogurt provide enough
protein for most grown
females — about 45 grams.
Add a peanut butter sandwich
and it is enough for most
college-aged males. Because
these foods are low in fat, the
calories are kept to a mini
mum.
Average Protein Content Of
Some Basic Foods
Protein-rich foods (7 grams of
protein each) — 1 oz. meat,
fish or poultry; 1 egg; Va cup
tuna fish; % cup beans, len
tils, split peas (cooked); 2

whole wheat pretzels
and breaksticks; fruit
(raw is best).
The Role of Fat
Fat is the most concentrated
source of calories in our food.
All kinds of fat — whether
animal fat, vegetable fat,
saturated or polyunsaturated
— contain nine calories per
gram. Compare that to the
four calories contained in a
gram of carbohydrate or
protein, or the seven calories
in a gram of pure alcohol.
We will concentrate on the
fat content of foods, rather
than the caloric content.
There are several reasons for
this:
• Fat is easier to spot than
calories. You can see it, feel it
and taste it.
• High fat intake contributes
to a variety of health prob
lems, including heart disease
and some types of cancer —
not to mention overweight.
It is true that we need some
fat in our diets to maintain
health. But the amount is very
small and Americans, on the
whole, eat far more than is ne

cessary, a habit that is taking
its toll on our health. At most,
30 percent of your daily
calories should come from fat.
That figure includes the fat
that foods naturally contain, as
well as the fat you add as but
ter, cooking oil, etc.
Use the list to help you find
low fat foods to replace the
high-fat ones.
Protein
Most of the high protein
foods eaten in this country are
also high in fat; like beef,
pork, cheese, and lunch
meats. Yet many weight re
duction plans rely heavily on
these foods. The only reason
such plans work (if they do), is
because they exclude carbo
hydrate foods at the same
time, sending the body into an
abnormal metabolic state
called ketosis. Few dieters are
seriously harmed by ketosis,
largely because they don't (or
can't stand to) stick with such
a diet for long. Instead, they
go back to a more balanced
diet, replenishing their bodily
stores and, to their dismay,
gaining back any of the weight
they might have lost.

Sound familiar? Even if it
doesn't, you can be sure that
permanent weight control will
only come with a reasonable
(and gradual) shift away from
high fat foods towards foods
high in complex car
bohydrates and fiber.
But what about the body's
need for protein? Protein is
important to a healthy body,
but that doesn't mean the
more protein you eat, the
healthier you will be. Extra
protein is like any other
foodstuff eaten in excess; if it
isn't burned up as energy or
otherwise used for bodily
functions, it is deposited as
fat. Only 12 percent of your
daily calories should come
from protein. On a 1500
calorie day, that translates to
about 45 grams of protein per
day. On a 1200 calorie day,
that includes about 40 grams
of protein daily.
It's easy to meet your
protein requirements without
large amounts of meat,
cheese, and other fatty foods.
A 3-ounce serving of chicken
or fish (about the size of your
palm) and 3 cups of nonfat
milk or yogurt provide enough
protein for most grown
females — about 45 grams.
Add a peanut butter sandwich
and it is enough for most
college-aged males. Because
these foods are low in fat, the
calories are kept to a mini
mum.
Average Protein Content Of
Some Basic Foods
Protein-rich foods (7 grams of
protein each) — 1 oz. meat,
fish or poultry; 1 egg; Va cup
tuna fish; % cup beans, len
tils, split peas (cooked); 2

There are few people, who at
one time or another, don't
worry about their weight. Here
are some general guidelines
on the best food to eat to
manage your weight.
Carbohydrates and Your Weight
Contrary to what was
believed complex car
bohydrates should make up
the largest percentage of
foods in your day. Here are
some facts to convince you
that complex carbohydrates
(starches) help your health
and your weight:
• Carbohydrates contain no
more calories than protein,
and less than half the calories
of fat. Foods that are high in
carbohydrates are generally
low in fat, like breads, grains,
pasta, potatoes, fruits and
vegetables. But foods that are
high in protein tend to be high
in fat as well, like meat,
cheese, and whole milk.
• What we put on top of
starchy food poses a much
more serious calorie and
health problem than the
starchy food itself. For exam
ple, adding sour cream to a
baked potato doubles the
calories; butter or margarine
does the same to bread. To
manage your weight it is impor
tant to control the cheese, but
ter, margarine, and sour cream
you put on potatoes, rice or
bread.
• Complex carbohydrates are
the starchy foods, and simple
carbohydrates are the sugars.
Obviously, we are not going
to suggest that you eat more
of the sugars, since they are a
concentrated form of carbohy
drate with little, if any, nutri
tional value. These include
cake, candy, cookies,
sweetened drinks, honey, and
sugar.
• Complex carbohydrate
foods that are minimally pro
cessed are the most desirable
ones. These include foods like

brown rice, whole wheat
bread, potatoes, barley, oats,
and more. Besides the addi
tional vitamins and minerals
found in these whole grain
products, there is also a lot of
fiber.
Fiber
If the average American eats
too much fat, he or she eats
too little fiber. One result of a
low fiber diet is that it takes
more food to fill you up.
Therefore, high fiber foods
play an important role in
weight management, and also
in disease prevention.
Numerous diseases are
thought to be related to low fi
ber diets, including diver
ticular disease, some types of
cancer, and possibly diabetes
and heart disease.
The best way to consume fi
ber (or any other nutrient) is
as food. That is, instead of
eating wheat fiber in the form
of bran, and continuing to eat
highly milled white bread, it
would be better to consume
the bran and the wheat flour
together as whole wheat
bread. Different types of fiber
serve different roles in our
bodies, and as long as we are
eating a varied diet — one
which includes different
fruits, vegetables, grains, and
cereals — we will be getting a
variety of fibers as well.
Below is a list of some high
fiber, complex carbohydrate
food to help you select meals
and snacks that are satisfying,
healthful, and kind to your
shape.
brown rice; baked
potato with skin; rolled
oats; beans, lentils, split
peas; bulgur; whole
grain cereals such as
shredded Wheat, All
Bran; all vegetables;
whole wheat bread or
rolls; bran muffins; rice
cakes; popcorn — not
buttered; bagels —

preferable, whole grain;
whole wheat pretzels
and breaksticks; fruit
(raw is best).
