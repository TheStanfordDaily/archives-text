tbsp. peanut butter; 1-2 tbsp.
nuts.
Dairy products (8 grams of
protein each) — 1 cup (8 02.)
milk or yogurt; 1 oz. cheese; V 3
cup cottage cheese.
Carbohydrate foods (2 grams of
protein each) — 1 slice bread;

potato.
Fruits, vegetables, and juices —
Most contain only small
amounts, which contribute a
total of roughly 10 grams daily
Remember, women need
only 45 grams of protein a day.
Men need 50. Even if this is all
you had, total, you can prob
ably afford to cut down on the
high calorie sources, like meat
and cheese.

Instead of These...
Regular hamburger meat (30%
fat)
Steaks, chops, or ribs
Fried chicken
Fried or grilled fish, or fish
sticks
Cheese (which is usually 20-
30% fat)

Fast Foods
Fast foods (e.g., Mac-
Donalds, Taco Bell, Kentucky
Fried Chicken, Jack In The
Box), may be convenient and
fast. However, they also may
be your worst enemies if you
are trying to reduce or manage

your weight. Most fast foods
are loaded with fat and salt. Al
most always they are low fiber
foods as well.
Even fish or chicken are not
necessarily good choices
when eaten in a fast food res
taurant because they are
breaded and deep-fried.
If you rely on fast foods for
some of your meals, choose
places that offer a salad bar
where you can control what
you eat. Remember to limit
the salad dressing.
As an example, a Mac-
Donalds Big Mac (541
calories), Regular French Fries
(211 calories) and Chocolate
Shake (364 calories) totals to
1116 calories for one meal.
Other common fast foods are

There's A Better Choice
Extra lean hamburger (15% fat)
Roast beef or veal, well
trimmed
Roast chicken or turkey (skin
removed)
Baked or broiled fish
Protein-rich vegetables, or
grains (like tofu, beans, brown
rice, bulgur).

sta tlingly high in fat and

We highly recommend that
you avoid fast foods as much
as possible.

Harvey Weinstein M.D.
How often do you run to The Store or to the
refrigerator when you are feeling down? After
the break-up of a love-affair, does your appetite
totally disappear? The association of food intake
with mood is one with which we are all familiar.
Food plays an enormous role in our lives, not
only in the sustenance that it offers but in the
security it provides most of us, and in the fear
that it instills in some of us. Memories are often
pleasantly related to meals; happy times
around a Thanksgiving turkey or an Easter ham.
As we get older, gatherings are often food
related, and remembering them, we feel a
sense of pleasure and peace.
For some, however, food is an enemy; an op
ponent to be fought at all costs. Mealtimes are
fraught with anxiety; food memories bring pain
and sometimes tears. For these people, food
only brings discomfort, feelings of anger, and
depression, rather than security. The many
joyous occasions which center around food
make these people run away. Avoidance of
food becomes even more important than
friendship. For these individuals, food is a
demon, a siren, tempting towards ruinous fat.
At this extreme are the many women stu
dents that suffer from bulimia. They fear their
lack of control, and move from highs to lows
depending on whether or not they have been
"good," that is, not having binged.
But for an even greater proportion of women
students, food also is treated as an enemy.
Overeating even a small amount is labeled as
abnormal. When this occurs, even "normal"

women students turn on themselves, becom
ing depressed and angry at their "over-eating."
They turn to dieting, and the cycle continues —
food deprivation followed by overeating. As
the pattern continues, moods fluctuate as well.
Emotional liability and dislike of one's own
body becomes the norm.
For men, it appears to be different. Many
male students overeat a great deal. Snacking
between meals is enjoyable and brings with it a
profound feeling of contentment. A striking
difference between men and women emerges.
Although both men and women report that
they binge eat, for women this brings distress
and bad feelings about themselves. For men,
binge eating is seen as normal, and makes
them feel good.
There appears to be little relationship be
tween binge eating and how a man feels about
himself and his body. Many of the women at
Stanford keep themselves slightly deprived of
food — telling themselves that 1000 calories is
healthy, and stifling hunger pains until there is
an intense craving for food.
On the other hand, hunger can sometimes
grow out of moods; food can, in itself, produce
changes. It has been theorized that excess food
may in fact result in changes at the
neurohumeral level of the brain cells; as
neurotransmitter levels fluctuate, so may
mood.
How sad it is that in our society, something
so basic as nourishment has become for many
women, a source of displeasure and of great
sadness and pain.
