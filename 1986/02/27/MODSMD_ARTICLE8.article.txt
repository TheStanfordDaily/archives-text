Some Facts About Calcium
Calcium is especially important
for the development and mainte
nance of strong bones and teeth.
Women are especially prone to a
bone problem called os
teoporosis, which can usually be
prevented by adequate intakes of
calcium. The roots of the ailment
lie in habits formed early in life,
and maintained through old age.
These habits include:
a adequate intake of calcium
a hormonal balance in women (as
signified by regular menstrual
periods)

• adequate weight-bearing activity
(anything from walking to com
petitive sports)
Milk and milk products are
among the best food sources of
calcium. You can avoid the fat and
calories from these foods if you
are careful to select the reduced
fat varieties, like low-fat (2%) or
nonfat (skim) milk and yogurt, and
lowfat cheeses such as mozzarella
and Farmers.
Both men and women should
get 800 milligrams of calcium
daily, or 1200 if they are still
growing.
