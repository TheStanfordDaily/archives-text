# Panel encourages student awareness of racism here
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Students, staff members and outside experts, speaking
at a forum last night, called for increased student aware
ness and a reshaping of the University to eradicate the in
justices of oppression and racism.
Most panel speakers at the event said racism is a socie
tal problem that Stanford perpetuates and urged students
to become more aware of racism so that they can begin to
fight it.
Panel member Mabel Teng, co-chair of the San Fran
cisco Rainbow Coalition, told the 300 people in the audi
ence to realize that they are "used as tools of oppression.
Take a stand and get involved."
"Racism is not just an ideology. It is a system which
subjugates people economically, politically and socially,"
Teng said.
The panel cited several examples of racism and ignor
ance of racism at Stanford.
The University began admitting blacks "in numbers"
only after the civil rights movement applied enough pres
sure in the late 19605, said Keith Archuleta, assistant
director of the Row.
There are signals indicating that the University is much
the same today, he added.
Archuleta cited several examples of this continuing
stance taken by Stanford: attacks by the University on
theme houses, the University's failure to divest its hold
ings in companies that do business in South Africa, and
ethnic studies' battles for support.
Several other panel members cited the value of theme
houses at Stanford. The houses are a "refuge," said junior

Felix Cuevas, a member of MeCH A. He argued that crit
ics don't take into account the interests of those who join
theme houses.
Donna Anderson, a member of the Black Student Un
ion (BSU), also defended theme houses, saying they were
integrated as opposed to segregated, as some critics claim.
"There are only three integrated dorms (theme houses)
.. .We should be proud of them â€” not attack them," she
said.
Several other panel members echoed Archuleta's
criticism of the University's actions in areas involving
minorities. The lack of ethnic material in the Western
Culture requirement is also a perpetuation racism at the
University, said sophomore Stacey Ley ton, a member of
the Stanford Central American Network (SCAN).
Ley ton suggested that the University make the program
address world culture instead of focusing primarily on the
the West. She also called for the University to commit it
self to ethnic studies by making the various ethnic studies
programs departments and end oppression of the workers
through attempts to break the United Stanford Workers
(USW), a union representing more than half of the Stan
ford technical, maintenance and service workers.
In addition to attempts at union breaking, minority
members of the union are having increasing difficulties
with the University's affirmative action program, accord
ing to USW President Tim Johnson.
The affirmative action program is designed to offer
minorities opportunities for advancement into manage
ment positions. The University and the union worked to
gether until 1982 when a new contract weakened the pro-

gram, Johnson said.
The situation further deteriorated
with the 1985 contract, according to
Johnson. "We lost everything
(regarding affirmative action)," he
said.
The forum, which included small
group discussions, was a success, ac
cording to moderator Shirley Wang,
a member of the Asian American
Studies Association (AASA). The
later discussions were helpful at
making the event an educational one,
and not just a debate, Wang, a sopho
more, said.
Archuleta was also impressed with
the forum. "I have never seen this

type of organization before," he said,
adding that this was one way to make
a fuller use of one's educational ex
perience at Stanford.
The forum is designed to be only
the first step in an on-going attempt
to educate students about racism, ac
cording to Wang. The organizers of
the event will be working through
Residential Education in the upcom
ing weeks, said Wang.
The event was organized by mem
bers of several campus organizations:
BSU, MeCHA, AAS A, Stanford
American Indian Organization, Stan
ford African Studies Association and
Stanford Central American Action
Network. The individuals worked on
behalf of their respective organiza
tions, Wang said.
