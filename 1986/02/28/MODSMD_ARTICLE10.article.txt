# According to expert, Soviets want Mideast

The fundamental Soviet preoc
cupation in the Middle East is to
"do what you can to reduce and
eliminate any American military
presence in the area," according to
an expert on Soviet behavior on the
international scene.
Dennis Ross, executive director
of the Berkeley-Stanford graduate
program on Soviet international be
havior, told a small group at Car
denal lounge last night that the
Soviets intend to maintain their po
sition in the Middle East as they
define their stake in the world.
As evidence, Ross cited instances
in which the Soviet Union has "run
risks in this part of the world that
they haven't run elsewhere."
By taking control of Egyptian air
defense against Israel in 1970 and
operating Syrian surface-to-air
missiles in 1983, the Soviets risked
confrontation with Israel that could
have escalated into a direct suner

power conflict, he said.
According to Ross, the Middle
East's importance lies in its prox
imity to the Soviet Union, its strate
gic location and its oil.
Ross said he believes Soviet posi
tions in Middle Eastern affairs may
become more accommodating to
the West in the future due to in
creasingly acute internal economic
problems.
"Capital investment (in the So
viet Union) was allowed to lag in
the late 1970s and early 1980s for
the sake of the defense buildup and
the food program, and their eco
nomy has suffered," he said.
The Soviet Union is "much more
likely to make certain concessions
with regards to restoring diplomatic
ties with Israel and relaxing Jewish
immigration," Ross said, because it
hopes to improve its image in the
West and seek the repeal of U.S.
laws that impede needed American
trade with the Soviet Union.
Ross said that Soviet concessions

will not come easily, because the
Soviets want to demonstrate
strength and the ability to compete
in the Middle East.
"The Soviets hate to do anything
that connotes a kind of weakness on
their part," Ross said. "The Soviets
are not going to make a concession
before they have to."
"What the Soviets mean by
'peace' is the absence of war," Ross
said, not complete normalization of

relations. "Whether they have a
long-term interest in that kind of
thing I don't know, but I think they
clearly have a short term interest."
he added.
Regardless of the future of the
region, "It's very important to [the
Soviets] to be a part of the arrange
ment," Ross said, adding that they
don't want an agreement to be
negotiated with Americans without
Soviets at the bargaining table.
