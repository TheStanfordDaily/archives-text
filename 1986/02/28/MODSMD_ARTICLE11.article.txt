### 
For a week or two after the Jan. 28 explosion of the
space shuttle Challenger, the country grieved for its
seven dead astronauts and blamed the disaster on what
surely must have been an unpreventable technical fail
ure. Many experts, after all, had said that disaster was
the inevitable price of space exploration. More
recently, however, investigators have begun to uncover
distressing evidence suggesting that the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration was not the in
nocent victim of an unavoidable technological failure.
The latest theory to emerge from the ongoing inves
tigation is that the explosion could have been
prevented if NASA officials had heeded either danger
ous temperature readings from the surface of the
rocket booster moments before lift-off or the advice of
engineers who developed the shuttle's boosters.
While it is essential to determine who was respon
sible for these oversights in order to ensure that there
will be no future disasters, it is equally important that
NASA re-examine its policies and address more fun
damental issues raised by the failure of officials to take
the time to consider postponing the launch.
NASA had scheduled 15 shuttle flights for 1986. A
former director of NASA's Office of Manned Flight

Safety said last week, "There seems to have been a
speed-up policy at NASA. There are signs that com
placency may have set in, and that is not good for
safety," Time magazine reports. A NASA engineer
added: "We are being driven by launch manifest, not
hardware capability or concerns about anything else."
NASA contractors have encouraged employees to
work six-day weeks with heavy overtime in order to
keep pace with the agency's requests, according to
Time.
The shuttle program is being pulled in too many dif
ferent directions at once, and the explosion may have
resulted indirectly from conflicting interests among
NASA officials. The Department of Defense is putting
demands on the space shuttle to carry out its work, ci
vilian researchers want the space shuttle for their ex
periments, and the president, it seems, wants the
shuttle for the public relations value of sending
civilians into space. NASA would be well advised to
pause for a moment and reconsider its priorites before
it loses public confidence. The shuttle is clearly in
tended for multi-purpose use as a space "truck," but if
the demands are outrunning the technology, limita
tions and prioritization are necessary.
