## Evangelists not typical 
### 
On Friday, "Brother Jed" and "Sister Pat," armed with
"the wrath of God," paid our campus a visit. Shades of
"Brother Jim" haunted a lot of upperclassmen's
memories (all three evangelists are from Campus Mini
stries, U.S.A., a radical evangelism group).
These open-air evangelists spent all afternoon in White
Plaza condemning Stanford students as "whoremongers,"
"homosexuals," "masturbators" and "perverts" who will
all be sent straight to hell. They seemed convinced that
because they were "filled with the Holy Spirit," they
themselves never sinned, and anyone who committed a sin
— Christian or non — would be doomed to hell. This
hellfire-and-brimstone sermon prompted a lot of jeers
and antics from the crowd, from one student pulling down
his pants to moon Sister Pat, to crowd mimicry of her ac
cusations of widespread "forn-i-ca-tion."

As Christians, we feel this particular brand of radical
evangelism only perpetuates the negative and misin
formed stereotypes a lot of non-Christians have about
Christianity. It's true, we once were eternally separated
from God through our sinful nature, but who can remem
ber that God has laid out a plan for our salvation, now
that these evangelists have come preaching only of man's
evil and separation from God? Did Brother Jed and Sister
Pat ever mention anything about God's love and His plan
for our redemption — our freedom from eternal death
and separation which was bought through Christ's blood
— interspersed in their condemnations? It pained us to
see them misrepresenting God's Word in their blind and
"righteous" fervor. Yet, we can only pray for these
children of God, who, to us, appear to be lost in their own
weaknesses. We aren't trying to make value judgments on
them, but to show that what they preach is just not what
the Bible says. Because of the recurrent appearance of
radical crusaders on campus, we feel a need to present His
Word as the Bible teaches us. We're not saying that we
know all there is to know about Christianity, but Colos
sians tells us to help one another increase in the wisdom of
the Word through sharing our faith.
In response to Matthew 7:1-5, about taking the plank
out of her own eye before accusing another of a speck in
theirs. Sister Pat assumes she has taken that plank out of
her own eye, and now has absolutely clear vision.
Granted, Sister Pat knows her Bible verses, but she rather

conveniently dismisses the context a lot of them were set
in. A lot of students were accusing her of judging others;
her response? "I have a right to judge you all, because it
says in the Bible that the righteous shall judge the un
righteous." But there is only One righteous enough to
judge. It says in the bible that man's judgment of others is
forbidden (see Matthew 7:1, Rom. 14:4, Rom. 14:13, 1
Cor 4:5, Jas 4:12). "There is only on Lawgiver and Judge
.. . but who are you to judge your neighbor?"
During a one-on-one "confrontation" with her, she
called us "hypocrite Christians," saying the divisions in
the Church would have to continue as long as there were
"people like [us] saying [we're] Christians when [we]
aren't." For one thing, our faith does not rely on any
man's judgment, but\on God's grace. It's not by anything
we do that we are saved. Ephesians says we have been
saved through faith — and this is not from ourselves, it is
the gift of God — not by works, so that no one can boast.
Furthermore, the Bible never says that those who are
saved are perfect. It says God is perfecting us each day,
but until we get to heaven, not one of us can or will be
perfect. In 1 John 1:8, it says "If we claim to be without
sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us ... If
we claim we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a
liar and His Word has no place in our lives." Of course,
the Bible mentions that anyone born of God does not con
tinue to sin, but this isn't saying that we're going to be per
fect if we're born again; it just means we are free from the
continuous, daily pattern of sin that once filled our lives. If
we're perfectly sinless now, this must be heaven.
Sister Pat also accused us, as well as a number of our
Christian friends and leaders, of not being truly filled with
the Holy Spirit. When we repent of our sins and are
baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so that our sins may
be forgiven, we will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
(Acts 2:38). Where does it say that until we are perfect,
we won't receive the Spirit? She also said that because
we're not all out on university campuses preaching the
Word, we aren't true Christians. True, the Bible does tell
us to go into the world and preach the good news, but
does this necessarily mean we all have to do it in the same
way, i.e., in a public forum? As Christians, our everyday
lives should be an effective witness to others.
Christianity is not synonymous with religiousness,
which too often implies empty ceremony and formalism.
We aren't religious, we just love the Lord.

us to go into the world and preach the good news, but

On Friday, "Brother Jed" and "Sister Pat," armed with
"the wrath of God," paid our campus a visit. Shades of
"Brother Jim" haunted a lot of upperclassmen's
memories (all three evangelists are from Campus Mini
stries, U.S.A., a radical evangelism group).
These open-air evangelists spent all afternoon in White
Plaza condemning Stanford students as "whoremongers,"
"homosexuals," "masturbators" and "perverts" who will
all be sent straight to hell. They seemed convinced that
because they were "filled with the Holy Spirit," they
themselves never sinned, and anyone who committed a sin
— Christian or non — would be doomed to hell. This
hellfire-and-brimstone sermon prompted a lot of jeers
and antics from the crowd, from one student pulling down
his pants to moon Sister Pat, to crowd mimicry of her ac
cusations of widespread "forn-i-ca-tion."

As Christians, we feel this particular brand of radical
evangelism only perpetuates the negative and misin
formed stereotypes a lot of non-Christians have about
Christianity. It's true, we once were eternally separated
from God through our sinful nature, but who can remem
ber that God has laid out a plan for our salvation, now
that these evangelists have come preaching only of man's
evil and separation from God? Did Brother Jed and Sister
Pat ever mention anything about God's love and His plan
for our redemption — our freedom from eternal death
and separation which was bought through Christ's blood
— interspersed in their condemnations? It pained us to
see them misrepresenting God's Word in their blind and
"righteous" fervor. Yet, we can only pray for these
children of God, who, to us, appear to be lost in their own
weaknesses. We aren't trying to make value judgments on
them, but to show that what they preach is just not what
the Bible says. Because of the recurrent appearance of
radical crusaders on campus, we feel a need to present His
Word as the Bible teaches us. We're not saying that we
know all there is to know about Christianity, but Colos
sians tells us to help one another increase in the wisdom of
the Word through sharing our faith.
In response to Matthew 7:1-5, about taking the plank
out of her own eye before accusing another of a speck in
theirs. Sister Pat assumes she has taken that plank out of
her own eye, and now has absolutely clear vision.
Granted, Sister Pat knows her Bible verses, but she rather

conveniently dismisses the context a lot of them were set
in. A lot of students were accusing her of judging others;
her response? "I have a right to judge you all, because it
says in the Bible that the righteous shall judge the un
righteous." But there is only One righteous enough to
judge. It says in the bible that man's judgment of others is
forbidden (see Matthew 7:1, Rom. 14:4, Rom. 14:13, 1
Cor 4:5, Jas 4:12). "There is only on Lawgiver and Judge
.. . but who are you to judge your neighbor?"
During a one-on-one "confrontation" with her, she
called us "hypocrite Christians," saying the divisions in
the Church would have to continue as long as there were
"people like [us] saying [we're] Christians when [we]
aren't." For one thing, our faith does not rely on any
man's judgment, but\on God's grace. It's not by anything
we do that we are saved. Ephesians says we have been
saved through faith — and this is not from ourselves, it is
the gift of God — not by works, so that no one can boast.
Furthermore, the Bible never says that those who are
saved are perfect. It says God is perfecting us each day,
but until we get to heaven, not one of us can or will be
perfect. In 1 John 1:8, it says "If we claim to be without
sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us ... If
we claim we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a
liar and His Word has no place in our lives." Of course,
the Bible mentions that anyone born of God does not con
tinue to sin, but this isn't saying that we're going to be per
fect if we're born again; it just means we are free from the
continuous, daily pattern of sin that once filled our lives. If
we're perfectly sinless now, this must be heaven.
Sister Pat also accused us, as well as a number of our
Christian friends and leaders, of not being truly filled with
the Holy Spirit. When we repent of our sins and are
baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so that our sins may
be forgiven, we will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
(Acts 2:38). Where does it say that until we are perfect,
we won't receive the Spirit? She also said that because
we're not all out on university campuses preaching the
Word, we aren't true Christians. True, the Bible does tell
us to go into the world and preach the good news, but
does this necessarily mean we all have to do it in the same
