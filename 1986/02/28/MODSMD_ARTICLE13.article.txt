Conference raises
student awareness
Communities outside the college
environment frequently express con
cern over the political and social
apathy they perceive at universities
across the country. Actually, today's
political and social activism is both
well-organized and flourishing. Noth
ing could provde a clearer illustration
of this fact than the attendance of
more than 150 students from 14 dif
ferent campuses at the Pacific North
west Political Leadership Training
Seminar sponsored by AIPAC
(American-Israel Public Affairs
Committee) last Sunday. We who at
tended the conference found our
desire for political involvement in
vigorated by the informative and in
spiring lectures and workshops.
The speakers, including Rep.
Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), stressed
the political importance of Israel as
an ally of the United States, drawing
attention to her democratic stability
and loyalty in the changeable, fre
quently hostile milieu of the Middle
East. With the growing abase of dem
ocratic ideals throughout the world in
such countries as the Philippines and
Haiti, the quality of Israeli democracy
becomes all the more apparent and
appreciated. Through the shared
values and goals of the two countries,
the United States and Israel must
continue to work to strengthen each
other both militarily and ideologi
cally.

As we left the conference, ener
getic and excited by a highly optimis
tic picture of our capabilities, we
realized that we could begin creating
effective solutions to existing con
flicts. As most students, we often feel
that our voices and opinions are
drowned out by the overwhelming
grandesse of the American political
process; but we left the conference
realizing that students can and should
make a difference. Furthermore, we
discovered that our new-found politi
cal awareness is mirrored across the
country by a growing network of stu
dent activism.

For students, fight
for ideals should
begin at Stanford
For the past couple weeks, I have
several times picked up The Daily to
discover that the Stanford campus has
realized the potential for power and
influence that its members possess. I
have been told, more than once,
"You Can Make A Difference" —
this being the title of a conference put
on by several University departments
last weekend. This coincidentally fol
lows an attitude reflected in a Daily
column by senior Darieck Scott which
tells us that we need not feel "guilty"

about abstention from participation
in social issues on campus; you can
make a difference later in your
careers. The talk concerning the need
for social responsibility is refreshing.
However, just when does this campus
think social responsibility begins?
What makes people think maintain
ing high ideals will be any easier with
a diploma?
Let's face it; the pressure to con
form and to "not make waves" is not
foreign to those persons over the age
of 22. Just walk into an employees'
lunchroom at any corporation and see
if the conversation centers around
their employer's ethics. It would seem
unlikely.
People, we are already "in the real
world." We live at and are educated
in one of those powerful, influential
corporations. If altering the ill-effects
produced by our society's emphasis
on economic values interests you, try
approaching our own "Board of
Directors," a.k.a., the trustees. See if
they will listen to you and take action
to promote morality. Or will they
merely abstain from voting at the
next shareholders' meetings to avoid
controversy? Try writing C.E.O.
Kennedy about your concerns. See if
your ideals warrant a return memo
stating, "I'll get back to you on it."
It is time the students at this
campus empower themselves by real
izing that making a difference is not a
spare-time activity we do on the
weekends when the studying isn't so
intense. Real change stems from a
commitment to a difficult struggle for

ethical behavior. This fight will al
ways be worthwhile. But, for
heaven's sake, start learning about it
now. One does not have to be at
Stanford very long to realize that the
commitment to making a difference
will never by anything less than a real
pain in the ass.

More to be done
before Stanford is
declared sanctuary
Wednesday's Daily reported that
the " ASSU Senate last night declared
Stanford a sanctuary for Central
American refugees." I would like to
clarify what the senate resolution ac
tually entails. The senate vote
represents senate support for sanctu
ary at Stanford and calls on the stu
dent body to declare Stanford a sanc
tuary for Central American refugees.
Stanford has not yet been declared a
sanctuary by the student body. The
issue will be presented to the campus
on the spring ASSU ballot. In the in
terim, student involvement is essen
tial to promote campus awareness of
the sanctuary issue and the plight of
refugees from El Salvador and
Guatemala.

careers. The talk concerning the need
for social responsibility is refreshing.
However, just when does this campus
think social responsibility begins?
What makes people think maintain
ing high ideals will be any easier with
a diploma?
Let's face it; the pressure to con
form and to "not make waves" is not
foreign to those persons over the age
of 22. Just walk into an employees'
lunchroom at any corporation and see
if the conversation centers around
their employer's ethics. It would seem
unlikely.
People, we are already "in the real
world." We live at and are educated
in one of those powerful, influential
corporations. If altering the ill-effects
produced by our society's emphasis
on economic values interests you, try
approaching our own "Board of
Directors," a.k.a., the trustees. See if
they will listen to you and take action
to promote morality. Or will they
merely abstain from voting at the
next shareholders' meetings to avoid
controversy? Try writing C.E.O.
Kennedy about your concerns. See if
your ideals warrant a return memo
stating, "I'll get back to you on it."
It is time the students at this
campus empower themselves by real
izing that making a difference is not a
spare-time activity we do on the
weekends when the studying isn't so
intense. Real change stems from a
commitment to a difficult struggle for

ethical behavior. This fight will al
ways be worthwhile. But, for
heaven's sake, start learning about it
now. One does not have to be at
Stanford very long to realize that the
commitment to making a difference
will never by anything less than a real
pain in the ass.

More to be done
before Stanford is
declared sanctuary
Wednesday's Daily reported that
the " ASSU Senate last night declared
Stanford a sanctuary for Central
American refugees." I would like to
clarify what the senate resolution ac
tually entails. The senate vote
represents senate support for sanctu
ary at Stanford and calls on the stu
dent body to declare Stanford a sanc
tuary for Central American refugees.
Stanford has not yet been declared a
sanctuary by the student body. The
issue will be presented to the campus
on the spring ASSU ballot. In the in
terim, student involvement is essen
tial to promote campus awareness of
the sanctuary issue and the plight of
refugees from El Salvador and
Guatemala.

Conference raises
student awareness
Communities outside the college
environment frequently express con
cern over the political and social
apathy they perceive at universities
across the country. Actually, today's
political and social activism is both
well-organized and flourishing. Noth
ing could provde a clearer illustration
of this fact than the attendance of
more than 150 students from 14 dif
ferent campuses at the Pacific North
west Political Leadership Training
Seminar sponsored by AIPAC
(American-Israel Public Affairs
Committee) last Sunday. We who at
tended the conference found our
desire for political involvement in
vigorated by the informative and in
spiring lectures and workshops.
The speakers, including Rep.
Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), stressed
the political importance of Israel as
an ally of the United States, drawing
attention to her democratic stability
and loyalty in the changeable, fre
quently hostile milieu of the Middle
East. With the growing abase of dem
ocratic ideals throughout the world in
such countries as the Philippines and
Haiti, the quality of Israeli democracy
becomes all the more apparent and
appreciated. Through the shared
values and goals of the two countries,
the United States and Israel must
continue to work to strengthen each
other both militarily and ideologi
cally.

As we left the conference, ener
getic and excited by a highly optimis
tic picture of our capabilities, we
realized that we could begin creating
effective solutions to existing con
flicts. As most students, we often feel
that our voices and opinions are
drowned out by the overwhelming
grandesse of the American political
process; but we left the conference
realizing that students can and should
make a difference. Furthermore, we
discovered that our new-found politi
cal awareness is mirrored across the
country by a growing network of stu
dent activism.

For students, fight
for ideals should
begin at Stanford
For the past couple weeks, I have
several times picked up The Daily to
discover that the Stanford campus has
realized the potential for power and
influence that its members possess. I
have been told, more than once,
"You Can Make A Difference" —
this being the title of a conference put
on by several University departments
last weekend. This coincidentally fol
lows an attitude reflected in a Daily
column by senior Darieck Scott which
tells us that we need not feel "guilty"

about abstention from participation
in social issues on campus; you can
make a difference later in your
careers. The talk concerning the need
for social responsibility is refreshing.
However, just when does this campus
think social responsibility begins?
