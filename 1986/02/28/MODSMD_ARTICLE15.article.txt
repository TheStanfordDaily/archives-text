# Palestinians need nation
## 
### 
The only thing that anyone can clearly see about the
Middle East is that it's a complete mess. After that, things
get confusing. This definitely holds true about the Arab-
Israeli conflict, but, in addition, it's an extremely touchy
and emotional topic for many people. Anti-Zionism is
seen as being not too far from anti-Semitism, while
defending the Palestinians is seen as endorsing terrorism.
I am neither anti-Semitic nor pro-terrorist, but I want to
point out that in the latest chapter of the "Middle East
Peace Process," the Palestinians are getting the short end
of the stick.

For quite a few months now, stories have been appear
ing in the press about the progress (or lack thereof) being
made in the efforts of Israel, Jordan and the Palestine
Liberation Organization to work toward peace. Recently,
the outlook has seemed to be somewhat hopeful for set
tling the futures of the Palestinian people and the West
Bank (occupied by Israel since the 1967 war). King Hus
sein of Jordan and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat signed
an agreement last February, pledging to work together
toward peace negotiations with Israel. And last October,
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres made a speech to the
United Nations promising to discuss terms of peace with
Hussein and a delegation of moderate Palestinians.
But last week, Hussein pulled out of the talks, saying
that Arafat had reneged on secret promises. What hap
pened?
To understand why preliminary peace talks have
ground to a halt, we have to look at what each of the par
ties involved has at stake.
First (and not surprisingly), the United States. This
chapter really opened with President Reagan's Middle
East peace initiative of September 1982. The initiative
called for Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian negotiations
about peace terms for the West Bank, and for some kind
of joint Jordanian-Palestinian government there. The
strategic interests of the United States involve the con
tinuing support of Israel, which makes U.S. support for
Palestinian self-determination all but impossible.
Second, Israel is interested in negotiating with Jordan
because she wants legal recognition of her annexation of
at least part of the West Bank. (She plans to give only part
of it back to Jordan, while keeping Jerusalem, the Jordan
Valley and parts that are heavily populated with Israeli
settlements.) There is a solid national consensus in Israel
never to recognize a Palestinian state anywhere on her
borders.
Third, Jordan is willing to negotiate for the return of
some of the West Bank, because without negotiations, the
Israeli military will continue to occupy all of it. Hussein
wants to bring Arafat along in order to get the endorse
ment of the Palestinians. The endorsement of the Pales
tinians is important, because without it, there is the possi
bility that the other Arab states will not recognize the
legitimacy of any treaty that comes out of the negotia
tions.

And oh yes, the Palestinians. They want a state.
As the American newspapers tell the story, it would
seem that the sticking point in the process is Arafat's
adamant refusal to endorse U.N. Resolutions 242 and
338. These resolutions call for Israel to return the occu
pied territories (the West Bank, Golan Heights and the
Gaza Strip) in return for peace with, and diplomatic
recognition by, the Arab countries. Although the resolu
tions recognize Israel's statehood, they say nothing about
a Palestinian state. Arafat has said repeatedly that he will
endorse the resolutions if, in return, the Palestinians will
be granted self-determination. And the United States, Is
rael and Jordan have repeatedly answered, "sorry, that's
not the deal."
Not even Hussein, although an Arab, feels solidarity
with Arafat on this cause. He simply wants the West Bank
back — giving it away to the Palestinians is only slightly
better than having it under Israeli occupation.
Might we not consider the possibility that the unreason
able parties in this case are not the Palestinians, but the
United States, Israel and Jordan?
A common argument in the United States and Israel is
that there is no reason to negotiate with terrorist lunatics
(i.e., the PLO). But to refuse to negotiate with the PLO is
to pass up any solution to the Palestinian problem in the
foreseeable future. The organization is the chosen repre
sentative of the Palestinian people. And although ter
rorism is never good, right or legitimate, people should
realize that the Israelis also engage in terrorism, and it is
not always retaliatory, and not always tit for tat.
Sometimes the counterstrikes are much more devastating,
and kill many more innocent people.
In addition, one can hate the PLO's methods and still
objectively realize the legitimacy of the Palestinians'
grievances. In 1947, 55 percent of Palestine was taken
away and given to the Zionists, who at that time com-»;
prised 33 percent of the population and owned 7 percent
of the land. This was the original U.N. partition plan — in
subsequent fighting that lasted for a few more years, the
Israelis gained much of the land that had been designated
for a Palestinian state.
I'm not going to do any Monday-morning quarterback
ing about this period of history, but the demands of the
Palestinians should, I think, be seen in historical perspec
tive.
Even more than looking backward, we should be
looking forward. What is the future of the Middle East if
the Palestinian question cannot be solved? If young Pales
tinians continue to grow up with a deep hatred for the Is
raelis?
Consider the consequences of continuing to refuse the
Palestinians a state. Other conflicts in the Middle East, for
instance, the Lebanese Civil War, are intimately related to
the Israeli-Palestinian problem. If these are to be re
solved, the more basic problem of Palestine must be also.
And we have seen the results of Hussein's break with
Arafat — those within the PLO who favored the Hussein-
Arafat agreement are losing power, while Arafat is be
coming convinced that moderation is not the answer. And
Syria is enormously pleased with the break, insisting that a
Middle East settlement isn't possible until the Arabs
achieve military parity with Israel. Is this progress?
If there is to be peace in the Middle East, the Pales
tinians must be given a homeland.

East peace initiative of September 1982. The initiative
called for Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian negotiations
about peace terms for the West Bank, and for some kind
of joint Jordanian-Palestinian government there. The
strategic interests of the United States involve the con
tinuing support of Israel, which makes U.S. support for
Palestinian self-determination all but impossible.
Second, Israel is interested in negotiating with Jordan
because she wants legal recognition of her annexation of
at least part of the West Bank. (She plans to give only part
of it back to Jordan, while keeping Jerusalem, the Jordan
Valley and parts that are heavily populated with Israeli
settlements.) There is a solid national consensus in Israel
never to recognize a Palestinian state anywhere on her
borders.
Third, Jordan is willing to negotiate for the return of
some of the West Bank, because without negotiations, the
Israeli military will continue to occupy all of it. Hussein
wants to bring Arafat along in order to get the endorse
ment of the Palestinians. The endorsement of the Pales
tinians is important, because without it, there is the possi
bility that the other Arab states will not recognize the
legitimacy of any treaty that comes out of the negotia
tions.

And oh yes, the Palestinians. They want a state.
As the American newspapers tell the story, it would
seem that the sticking point in the process is Arafat's
adamant refusal to endorse U.N. Resolutions 242 and
338. These resolutions call for Israel to return the occu
pied territories (the West Bank, Golan Heights and the
Gaza Strip) in return for peace with, and diplomatic
recognition by, the Arab countries. Although the resolu
tions recognize Israel's statehood, they say nothing about
a Palestinian state. Arafat has said repeatedly that he will
endorse the resolutions if, in return, the Palestinians will
be granted self-determination. And the United States, Is
rael and Jordan have repeatedly answered, "sorry, that's
not the deal."
Not even Hussein, although an Arab, feels solidarity
with Arafat on this cause. He simply wants the West Bank
back — giving it away to the Palestinians is only slightly
better than having it under Israeli occupation.
Might we not consider the possibility that the unreason
able parties in this case are not the Palestinians, but the
United States, Israel and Jordan?
A common argument in the United States and Israel is
that there is no reason to negotiate with terrorist lunatics
(i.e., the PLO). But to refuse to negotiate with the PLO is
to pass up any solution to the Palestinian problem in the
foreseeable future. The organization is the chosen repre
sentative of the Palestinian people. And although ter
rorism is never good, right or legitimate, people should
realize that the Israelis also engage in terrorism, and it is
not always retaliatory, and not always tit for tat.
Sometimes the counterstrikes are much more devastating,
and kill many more innocent people.
In addition, one can hate the PLO's methods and still
objectively realize the legitimacy of the Palestinians'
grievances. In 1947, 55 percent of Palestine was taken
away and given to the Zionists, who at that time com-»;
prised 33 percent of the population and owned 7 percent
of the land. This was the original U.N. partition plan — in
subsequent fighting that lasted for a few more years, the
Israelis gained much of the land that had been designated
for a Palestinian state.
I'm not going to do any Monday-morning quarterback
ing about this period of history, but the demands of the
Palestinians should, I think, be seen in historical perspec
tive.
Even more than looking backward, we should be
looking forward. What is the future of the Middle East if
the Palestinian question cannot be solved? If young Pales
tinians continue to grow up with a deep hatred for the Is
raelis?
Consider the consequences of continuing to refuse the
Palestinians a state. Other conflicts in the Middle East, for
instance, the Lebanese Civil War, are intimately related to
the Israeli-Palestinian problem. If these are to be re
solved, the more basic problem of Palestine must be also.
And we have seen the results of Hussein's break with
Arafat — those within the PLO who favored the Hussein-
Arafat agreement are losing power, while Arafat is be
coming convinced that moderation is not the answer. And
Syria is enormously pleased with the break, insisting that a
Middle East settlement isn't possible until the Arabs
achieve military parity with Israel. Is this progress?
If there is to be peace in the Middle East, the Pales
tinians must be given a homeland.

The only thing that anyone can clearly see about the
Middle East is that it's a complete mess. After that, things
get confusing. This definitely holds true about the Arab-
Israeli conflict, but, in addition, it's an extremely touchy
and emotional topic for many people. Anti-Zionism is
seen as being not too far from anti-Semitism, while
defending the Palestinians is seen as endorsing terrorism.
I am neither anti-Semitic nor pro-terrorist, but I want to
point out that in the latest chapter of the "Middle East
Peace Process," the Palestinians are getting the short end
of the stick.

For quite a few months now, stories have been appear
ing in the press about the progress (or lack thereof) being
made in the efforts of Israel, Jordan and the Palestine
Liberation Organization to work toward peace. Recently,
the outlook has seemed to be somewhat hopeful for set
tling the futures of the Palestinian people and the West
Bank (occupied by Israel since the 1967 war). King Hus
sein of Jordan and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat signed
an agreement last February, pledging to work together
toward peace negotiations with Israel. And last October,
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres made a speech to the
United Nations promising to discuss terms of peace with
Hussein and a delegation of moderate Palestinians.
But last week, Hussein pulled out of the talks, saying
that Arafat had reneged on secret promises. What hap
pened?
To understand why preliminary peace talks have
ground to a halt, we have to look at what each of the par
ties involved has at stake.
