### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Three Stanford football players pleaded no con
test yesterday to charges of burglary and forgery in
connection with a Dec. 3 incident at Emporium-
Capwell department store.
Freshman Sam Sutherland, sophomore Ken
Richardson and junior Wendell Brown are sched
uled to be sentenced March 28 at San Jose Superior
Court.
The students pleaded no contest to charges of
second-degree burglary with intent to commit theft
at the Emporium-Capwell in the Stanford Shop
ping Center, and one count of check forgery,
defrauding the Wells Fargo Bank of more than
$300.
In addition, Sutherland pleaded no contest to an
other forgery count, defrauding the Wells Fargo

Bank of $240.75. Richardson entered a no contest
plea to the charge of forgery of a driver's license.
A no contest plea is tantamount to a guilty plea
in the case of the three defendants, as they have
waived the right to a preliminary examination and
will proceed directly to Superior Court for sentenc
ing, according to presiding Judge Timothy Hanifin.
Sutherland, Richardson and Brown gave the no
contest pleas and agreed to make restitution to all
victims involved in the case provided that they are
not given a prison sentence and that the chaises —
which are now considered felonies — be reduced to
misdemeanors at the time of sentencing, according
to Brown.
"If we had pleaded not guilty, the charges would
have been tried as felonies in Superior Court,"
Brown said.
According to Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole,
the University is looking into the case with respect

to the Fundamental Standard.
She said that although the"the University policy
on internal discipline is to keep it confidential ... a
typical penalty in this [case] is an indefinite suspen
sion." An indefinite suspension usually means two
years, she added.
Cole said she did not know if such a penalty
would be appropriate in this case.
Any disciplinary action against the students
would be included in next fall's Judicial Affairs Of
fice report, bu.'iite students would not be identified
by name, she said.
According to junior Dan Brumbaugh, the three
stole his Visa card on or about Dec. 3 with which
they charged $300 of merchandise. Sutherland also
cashed checks stolen from him for $1,800, Brum
baugh said.
