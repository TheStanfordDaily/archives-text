## Gollum column 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
From the columnist who gave you bathroom philosophy, appearing in
the next few inches: a scalding, in-depth exploration of steam tunnels!
I figure you're probably dying for something to get your mind off the
weather. So here's some refreshing talk about the dark, creepy, confined
places lurking bowel-like under your lecture halls at this very moment.
Since I'm sure none of you Honor Code-fearing citizens would ever
trespass against the University's off-limits entrails yourselves, I'll reveal
some excerpts from my on-the-spot interview with a strange little green
eyed guy I found living in the maze of tunneling that connects the Quad
with its hot air.
"Where am I?" (The ever-probing, inquiring nature of the headachey
journalist prompts her to speak.)
"This iss a gollum about the steam tunnelss. Assk me a harder riddle,"
the emaciated slimewad titters, rubbing its long-fingered hands in ap
preciation of its own precious attempt at self-reference.
I groan, knowing it's going to be another one of those schizophrenic
columns and dreading the time when I make my inevitable Freudian al
lusion.
"How long have you been down here?" I ask, eyeing its tattered red
cardigan.

"The steam plants wass
unstructed in 1894 and
steam iss here now,
everywhere. Sniff in the
pipes. Sniff in the air. Tun
nel makes steam. I am
steam."
"Could you be more spe
cific?"
"Ssteam," it blithers,
pausing to pluck a cock
roach off the grotto wall
with a swipe of its finger.
"Mmm. Gregor Samsa iss
good to crunch." It offers
me the other half of the
bug, but I decide not to
savor Kafka in this manner,
worrying about the after
taste a writer like that
would leave in one's

mouth. 112 1 """ 1 iiii'iii 1
It shrugs and finishes off the front segments, licking antennae from the
corners of its wide mouth. "Class of Ought-Three," it proclaims, sticking
out its right hand.
"I wass going to be a geology major, but I failed Earthquakes and
Man and they put me down here to be closer to my subject," he lisped,
scurrying around a little in the dusty floor's debris of albino Domino's
boxes and fructose-encrusted Bartles and Jaymes bottles.
"You get many visitors down here?" I query, trying to picture how the
pizza delivery guy would ever find this place. Yeah, just turn left at the
first 325-degree valve leak and follow the two-foot tubing to the end of
the shaft.
"Lotss of visitors. Maintenance personnel are crunchier than under
grads," he assured me, rolling his eyes like Yoda before I swooned.
From my pre-interview research with the ever-mustachioed campus
police, I had discovered that steam tunneling, spelunking or just getting
away from your roommate, is considered trespassing and is punishable
by fines, probation or even jail sentences.
Breck Breckenridge, the University's supervisor of steam fitters,
guessed that the steam tunnels get as hot as 120 degrees, and wouldn't
guarantee that the fittings won't dec&y and spew even hotter steam at
any time, even though he tries to spruce up the tunnels with fumigation
every year or so.
My companion looked like he had survived several such purgings, its
whole body pulled slick like one big scar from a steam burn.
"How do you survive down here?"
"Dental floss."
"But you don't have any teeth."
"No, sssilly, about 75 yards worth to leave a trail. Flashlights. Long
sleeved T-shirtss. Open pores," he rattled off.
Just then I heard a familiar whine of a voice. That guy never would
forgive me for telling him penis envy was a male disorder.
"Where is that wascally kid?" he said. You could see his cigar's bea
con down the tunnel.
"Id? What id?" the globule burped, munching like a devoted cock
roach connoisseur and stumbling off into the blackness.
