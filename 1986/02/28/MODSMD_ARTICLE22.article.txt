# Objectively speaking on the Farm

"Who is John Gait?" "Who is Ayn Rand?" To
find answers for both of these questions, you might
ask the Stanford Objectivists.
The Stanford Objectivists, formed last fall quar
ter, is an association based upon the philosophy of
Ayn Rand which seeks to promote intellectual in
quiry. The club was formed by sophomore Donna
Regenbaum and junior Rob Weitzner, both of
whom had read Rand and were interested in her
philosophy.
Through her books, Rand introduced her own
unique philosophy, which she called Objectivism.
"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man
as a heroic being, with his won happiness as the
moral purpose of his life, with productive achieve
ment as his noblest activity, and reason as his only
absolute," she once wrote.
According to freshman Dave Smith, the Objec
tivists' vice president, "The aims of the club are
straightforward: to create a forum for discussion
and expansion of Objectivism, to acquaint more
people with its ideas and to sponsor interesting
speakers on topics relevant to philosophy's role in
the world in which we live. But beyond all these
practical goals there is a greater, infinitely simpler
purpose: namely, to think."
The club has approximately 30 members and
meets once a week on Tuesday nights at Tresidder

to discuss essays from Rand's book, "The Virtue of
Selfishness." Subjects of discussion have included
man's rights, the nature of government, Objectivist
ethics, selfishness and a topic entitled "Bleeding
Hearts and Liquid Assets."
The essays, according to Regenbaum, form the
basis of discussion and usually lead the conversa
tion off in many directions.
"We're not interested in indoctrination but in
encouraging critical thinking and the exchange of
ideas," said Regenbaum. Added Weitzner, "The
purpose of the club is to stimulate discussion."
Both students stressed the practical uses of ob
jectivism. According to Weitzner, "Philosophy
provides a conceptual framework upon which to
build your life. I think people need it." Regenbaum
agreed. "This is a chance to meet people interested
in thinking and talking about philosophy," she
commented.
The club also invites speakers to talk on various
subjects. "We like to bring in a person who has
achieved something in this society," said Regen
baum. Previous speakers have included Senior
Hoover Research Fellow Robert Hessen, Classics
Prof. Emeritus Anthony Raubitschek and Senior
Hoover Research Fellow Mikhail Bernstam.
The big event for the quarter, according to
Weitzner, is a debate next Tuesday entitled "Is
there a God?" between Gordon Stein, president of
a group called the Free Thought Association, and

Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of Memorial
Church.
"One of our major reasons behind sponsoring
the debate is that religion is a highly personal issue
to thoughtful and sensitive people. Instead of the
circus-like atmosphere of White Plaza prophets, we
are offering an intellectual forum in which to dis
cuss this important topic," said Weitzner.
The club has been well-received by students, ac
cording to Regenbaum. Both Regenbaum and
Weitzner attribute the club's success to the quality
of its programs, its provocative subjects and the
students' familiarity with Rand's works.
"Organizing quality programs is a big time com
mitment, but it's certainly worth it when they come
to fruition," said Regenbaum. Said Weitzner, "we
set an example â€” you can achieve what you want
to do."
Regenbaum and Weitzner also are planning a
newsletter which would contain students' writings
about Rand's philosophy and anything else of in
terest to students. "This is to be a forum for people
to express their talents," Regenbaum said.
Both students emphasized that not all of the
ideas tossed around in meetings are Randian. "We
want to present all sides," said Regenbaum.
Weitzner expressed similar sentiments. "We don't
want to fall into the trap of groupthink. We want to
put ideas in the forefront and have people think
about them," he said.
