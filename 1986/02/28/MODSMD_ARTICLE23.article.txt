## 1985: a casus belli year for film critics 
### STEVE VINEBERG Special to The Daily 
1985 is the first year in the decade
and a half since I wrote my first
"best" lists that fewer than half of the
movies in my top 10 have been
American. It's not that the output of
other countries has been so extraor
dinarily impressive; it's just that
American movies seem to have
reached their nadir, at least since the
gloomy days of the '50s.
I've never seen so much banal, pre
dictable, uncourageous work by so
many Hollywood directors. This was
the year of "The Breakfast Club,"
"Mask," "Perfect," "Brewster's Mil
lions," "Cocoon," "The Goonies,"
"Silverado," "Jagged Edge," "To
Live and Die in L.A.," "Eleni,"
"White Nights," "Target," "A
Chorus Line," "The Jewel of the
Nile," "Twice in a Lifetime," "The
Trip to Bountiful" and"The Young
Sherlock Holmes."
Bored critics, bad flicks
It was the year when critics, having
nothing more inspiring to write
about, invented distinctions for the
New Downtown New York Movies
("Desperately Seeking Susan" and
"After Hours"), the New Minimalist
Movie ("Blood Simple") and the
New Art House Movie ("Kiss of the
Spider Woman").
It was the year Louis Malle di
rected "Alamo Bay," John Boorman
released "The Emerald Forest,"
Robert Altman made little impres
sion with "Fool for Love," Jean-Luc
Godard moved ever farther into
oblivion with "Hail Mary!," Michael
Cimino lost all his supporters when
he showed his terminally moronic
"Year of the Dragon," and two gifted
emigres, Fred Schepisi and Roger
Donaldson, frittered themselves away
on "Plenty" and "Marie."
It was the year the British went
back to making '50s-style kitchen
sink dramas ("Dance with a
Stranger"), '60s-style puzzle pictures
("Wetherby," "Insignificance"), and
doom-and-gloom specials to ring in
the apocalypse (" 1984," "Brazil").
It was the year Steven Spielberg
chose to remake "Song of the South"

and Sydney Pollack tried to be David
Lean in Africa.
It was the year of Sylvester
Stallone.
Minor pleasures in Hollywood
Indeed, 1985 offered so few
pleasures that even the minor ones
seem in retrospect like revelations.
Two young directors, Tim Burton and
Stuart Gordon, displayed wit and in
ventiveness and highly individual
styles in their debut pictures, "Pee
Wee's Big Adventure" and "Re
animator." The Robert Zemeckis-
Bob Gale whizbang special "Back to
the Future" and Frank Perry's
"Compromising Positions," with its
prickly Susan Isaacs script and half a
dozen gifted actresses in the cast,
were the most enjoyable summer
comedies, though neither matched
"A Private Function" (direction by
Malcolm Mowbray, script by Alan
Bennett) or "Lost in America"
(script and direction by Albert
Brooks) for true eccentric vision.
Bright comedies even in dismal years
These six films — all but one the
work of Americans — proved that
even in the most dismal years, a few
bright comedies are possible, and the
best sections in John Huston's
"Godfather" burlesque, "Prizzi's
Honor" (mostly the scenes involving
Anjelica Huston and William
Hickey), confirmed it.
There were other memorable cut
tings of film as well — the first half of
the Cannes Festival prize winner,
"When Father Was Away on Busi
ness" (directed by Emir Kusturica)
and of Jill Chopra's "Smooth Talk"
(an adaptation of the Joyce Carol
Oates story "Where Are You Going,
Where Have You Been"); one
lengthy interview with a disturbed,
nomadic young man in Michael
Apted's "28 Up"; the end of Part I
and the beginning of Part II of Claude
Lanzmann's "Shoah"; bits and pieces
of "Mac Arthur's Children"; the
merry middle hour of "Lily in Love"
(an uncredited revision of the Ferenc
Molnar farce "The Guardsman"); the
last five minutes of "The Official
Story."
"Streetwise" was the best whole
documentary. Peter Weir's

" Witness" was a tribute to craftsman
ship and the dance-compilation film
"That's Dancing!" to good taste. And
"St. Elmo's Fire," with its lively
young cast, was the year's most enter
taining bad movie.
The 10 best films of 1985
The following list of the 10 best
pictures I saw last year suggests the
more substantial pleasures of a year
that — God help us! — may be an
omen of worse things to come;
1. The Home and the World
Though he is still too little known
in the West, the Indian director
Satyajit Ray is certainly the world's
most extraordinary living filmmaker;

he has been making exquisite movies
for three decades, and he has never
(to my knowledge) made a bad
picture. With "The Home and the
World," he returns to his favorite au
thor, Rabindranath Tagore, for a
story of the wages of freedom.
In the 19th century, a progressive
prince educates his wife and liberates
her from the shelter of purdah. Her
first act as a woman of independent
mind is to fall in love with a dashing,
sly, opportunistic rabble-rouser, and
the prince, bound by his allegiance to
free choice (and his love for her)
stands by, powerless to avert the
tragedy that ensues. The trio of
central characters is played, peer
lessly, by Victor Banerjee,
Swatilekha Chatterjee and Soumitra
Chatterjee.
2. The Shooting Party
Alan Bridges, a supervisor of great

restraint and intelligence (see "The
Return of the Soldier"), turns into a
filmmaker with this full-scale (and
remarkably faithful) adaptation of
Isabel Colegate's fine 1980 novel. Set
on the eve of the First World War,
this movie uses Renoir's metaphor of
the hunt to illuminate the state of
mind and heart of the British aris
tocracy in the last days of its glory.
The writing is acutely attentive, the
acting by a robust cast (James Mason,
Edward Fox, Cheryl Campbell,
Dorothy Tutin, Robert Hardy, Judi
Bowker, et.al.) as supple and unself
consciously revealing as in a great
production of Anton Chekhov.

3. The Makioka Sisters
Kon Ichikawa, whose "Fires on the
Plain" (1961) is perhaps the greatest
Japanese film not made by Kurosawa,
has an autumnal triumph with this
adaptation of Junichiro Tanizaki's
epic novel about a great industrial
family in decline during the Depres
sion. (Ichikawa was nearing 70 when
he filmed this picture, in 1983.) It was
at once the most sensuous and most
superbly crafted movie released in
the United States all year. Ichikawa is
a painterly director in the best sense
of the phrase — you get an erotic
charge out of his mastery of the
medium. The four sisters whose ten
sions form the dynamic of the movie
are played by Keiki Kishi, Yoshiko
Sakuma, Sayuri Yoshinaga and Yuko
Kotegawa.
4. The Purple Rose of Cairo
Woody Allen's 13th film is inef

fably sweet, imaginative and suffused
with feeling. This time out, Allen
himself is invisible; he passes the bur
den of shouldering the movie's con
ceit onto Mia Farrow, who plays
Cecilia, a poor working girl in
Depression-era New Jersey. Married
to an insensitive lug, Cecilia finds her
only escape in movies; one night, a
handsome adventurer (Jeff Daniels)
leaps off the screen and enters her
life. "The Purple Rose" is a full
length variation on one of Allen's
best stories, "The Kugelmass
Episode," but it has its own tenderly
loony tone, and it's gracefully charm
ing in a way none of Allen's other
films has been. Mia Farrow gives a
transcendent performance reminis
cent of Lillian Gish, and — as seven
characters in search of an eighth who
has escaped — Edward Herrmann,
John Wood, Zoe Caldwell, Van
Johnson, Deborah Rush, Milo
O'Shea and Karen Akens do expertly
controlled comic turns.
5. Dreamchild
Dennis Potter wrote this fantasia
on the lives of Rev. Charles Dodgson
(Lewis Carroll) and Alice
Hargreaves, who at age 10, inspired
Carroll to write the " Alice" books. A
strange, one-of-a-kind picture, it has
a dark tone and a highly original,
suggestive psychological idea.
Dodgson is in love with Alice and
painfully aware of the absurdity of
the position this puts him in, and the
child recognizes his predicament
without comprehending it fully.
The Victorian sections of the movie
concern Dodgson's struggle with this
extraordinary emotional situation.
The New York sections, set early in
the Depression (when Mrs.
Hargreaves, now an octogenarian,
comes to Columbia University to
receive an honorary degree on the oc
casion of Dodgson's centenary) are
chiefly about Hargreaves' gradual un
derstanding of Dodgson's feelings for
her and her own semi-inadvertent
cruelty toward him. Then there are
the utterly remarkable scenes involv
ing Dodgson's literary creations,
brought to life by Jim Henson's pup
pets. The director (Gavin Millar) sus

tains a prickly, hostile tone in these
segments. Coral Browne and lan
Holm have never been better than
they are in the central roles.
6. Songwriter
Bud Shrake wrote and Alan
Rudolph (working in a style
remarkably different from the one he
used in 1984's "Choose Me") di
rected this charmer, the most ram
bunctious comedy of the year. Willie
Nelson plays a crafty country-western
crooner set on winning his indepen
dence from his producer (Richard
Serafian, in an uproariously outsize
parodic performance). Kris Kristof
ferson adds his considerable charms
to Nelson's as his buddy and
sometime partner, and there are won
derfully imaginative contributions
from Rip Torn, Melinda Dillon and
especially Lesley Ann Warren, whose
portrayal of the alcoholic singer Nel
son discovers is a small classic.
(Swigging whiskey when sudden suc
cess has begun to unnerve her, War
ren murmurs to her unheeding men
tor, "I'm gonna bring you a lot of
trouble.") Most cities haven't seen
"Songwriter," which Tri-Star
Pictures (to its shame) had no faith in,
but even on video you can tell that
photographer Matthew Leonetti has
given the film a marvelous look — a
burnished haze.
7. Ran
This gloss on "King Lear" could be
Akira Kurosawa's answer to the
question that lies at the heart of the
play's mystery: "Is there a cause in
nature that makes these hard
hearts?" Hidetora is a warlord who
owes his own kingdom to his bloody
conquests of neighboring lands; two
of his three sons are married to
women who were themselves the
spoils of war, and whose families he
annihilated in order to annex their
castles. In Kurosawa's conception the
destruction of Hidetora's kingdom is
a direct response to the old chieftain's
brutality and mercilessness.
Kurosawa (now 75) seems to be
saying that if we're going to feel com
passion toward Hidetora, it will have
to be because he's weak and old and

mad and helpless, not because he's
earned our sympathy. And we can in
fer a different but parallel message
about "Ran" itself: we're going to
respond to the film because it is bril
liant and not because it's likable, or
exciting or funny, like Kurosawa's
earlier work. "Ran" is Kurosawa's
most obstinate film, espousing a
tough, unyielding humanism that you

have to wrestle with. But it is bril
liant.
8. The Return of the Soldier
Alan Bridges' supremely intelligent
adaptation of a deft and economical
1918 novel by Rebecca West
preserves the period fascination of
the book — the slow cracking of the
class system, the early feminist con
sciousness, the Freudianism. It's a
movie that offers the pleasures of
emotional and esthetic distance, of
superb designs (sets by Luciana Ar
righi, costumes by Shirley Russell),

and of a cast that could hardly be im
proved upon. Alan Bates plays the
amnesiac sent back from the war to
his pampered, coquettish wife (Julie
Christie), whom he no longer knows;
Glenda Jackson is the middle-class
woman he loved as a youth and
whose love he yearns for once again;
and Frank Finlay is her patient, dig
nified husband.
9. Heartbreakers
One of the few American movies of
recent years that has attempted to get
the mood of a relationship on screen.

Peter Coyote and Nick Mancuso are
best buddies whose friendship ab
sorbs their individual states of
desperation about where their lives
are leading. It's a warm friendship,
but it has a keen competitive — and
erotic — edge. Bobby Roth wrote
and directed this highly unconven
tional movie, which is poised on the
boundary of an artistic danger zone:
it's so subtle an examination of con
temporary masculine codes that it
keeps eluding you. With Carole
Laure, Kathryn Harrold and Carol

Wayne.
10. Sweet Dreams
The screenwriter, Robert Getchell,
has an unusual ear for the way Amer
ican adults converse when their
guards are down — that is, in intimate
(marital and filial) relationships. It's
his startlingly lifelike writing that
makes this biographical treatment of
country-western singer Patsy Cline so
different from other entries in this
genre. The movie focuses not on
Patsy's career but on her stormy mar
riage to Charlie Dick, and so it has

closer connections to "Shoot the
Moon" and the second half of "New
York, New York" and Getchell's ear
lier "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore" than it does to "Funny
Girl" and "Coal Miner's Daughter."
Jessica Lange, Ed Harris and Ann
Wedgeworth (in the smaller role of
Patsy's mother, Hilda Lensley) give
magnificent performances. Karel
Reisz directed.
Steve Vineberg, the Daily's movie
critic until last June, now teaches
drama at Holy Cross College.
