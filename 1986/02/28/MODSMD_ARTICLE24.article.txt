# A 						mixed bag of music enlivened 1985
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Another year in the world of rock
'n' roll, that sprightly form of music
the Campus Ministry preachers in
White Plaza and the Washington
Wives so love to despise, has come
and gone. It's time to do some serious
assessment here.
If you read Steve Vineberg's
review of 1985 in film on page 7,
you'll come away with the impression
that it was one of the worst years for
film in a long time. Well, I'm not
going to be nearly so pessimistic in
my diatribe, but I will get the gripes
out of the way before I get to the
goodies.
Blame it on Cain
This was a bad year for at least a
couple of artists who made critical
landslides with their earlier work.
Prince and X, who consistently
delivered excellent punches with the
1 1 albums they recorded between
them from 1978 to 1984, fell victims
to their own virtuosity in 1985.
Prince's "Around the World in a
Day" created a furor when it was
released in April — KZSU went ab
solutely gaga over it, and it eventually
went No. 1 on the pop charts —
became rather tiring rather quickly.
Prince is at his best when he examines
sexuality, and he tends to become
bombastic and weak lyrically when he
writes songs about communism and
mushroom clouds and rich Parisian
floozies.
Whereas Prince fell flat on his face
last year with bad songwriting, the
erstwhile critics' favorites from Los
Angeles, X, went into the strato
sphere with overblown musical ar
rangements that buried otherwise in
teresting lyrics. "Ain't Love Grand"
(with its amusing promo shot of

Exene Cervenka posing in a potato
sack) was a prime example of how not
to produce an album: X brought in a
mainsteam producer to turn their
music into pop radio material, and he
got Billy Zoom's magnificently un
derstated guitar sound in his power
pop hands and turned it into over
blown, bland kitsch.
Grammy garbage and glory
The Grammy awards Tuesday
night didn't do much to encourage
original artists to pursue their visions,
either (not that anyone expected
them to). This was the year of cause
music with a capital C, and the
Grammy voters knew they had to
give the award for both record and
song of the year to USA for Africa's
grandiose "We Are the World."
(Michael Jackson, accepting one of
the statues for the fund-raising group,
said God inspired him and Lionel
Richie to write the song, to give you
some idea of the enormous metap
horical weight thrown behind this one
piece of standard pop fluff.)
Album of the year was, sadly but
predictably enough, Phil Collins' "No
Jacket Required" — a very listenable
but also very conventional collection
of dance pop by a former art-rock
icon. Collins also got a trophy for best
male pop vocal; his female counter
part was Whitney Houston ("Saving
All My Love for You"), whose
precise vocals were all over the
airwaves last year. Best pop group
vocal was "We Are the World" once
again.
In the rock category, the voters
gave statues to Don Henley ("Money
for Nothing"), Tina Turner ("One of
the Living," from the
"Thunderdome" soundtrack) and
Dire Straits ("Money for Nothing").
Rhythm and blues awards went to

Stevie Wonder ("In Square Circle"),
Aretha Franklin ("Freeway of
Love") and the Commodores ("Night
Shift").
Now I'm just amused
In a year when pop radio continued
its foray into nothingness, when soul
radio opened its doors to a whole
gaggle of Prince imitators and fled
glings, when a lot of rock radio either
reformatted itself to play oldies or to
bow down to the spangled tribe of
heavy metal artists that never go

away, there were still some good mo
ments.
Which brings me to the 10 albums I
thought were the best of last year's
crop. To give you an idea of what crit
ics across the country thought, these
were the 10 albums voted as best of
the year in the Village Voice's annual
poll:
1. Talking Heads' "Little
Creatures"
2. The Replacements' "Tim"

3. John Cougar Mellencamp's
"Scarecrow"
4. Tom Waits' "Rain Dogs"
5. Artists United Against Apart
heid's "Sun City"
6. Husker Du's "Flip Your Wig"
7. R.E.M.'s "Fables of the
Reconstruction"
8. Husker Du's "New Day Rising"
9. Aretha Franklin's "Who's
Zoomin' Who"
10. John Fogerty's "Centerfield"
Now here's my list:

1. Sade's" Diamond Life"/" Promise."
Take your pick. Sade deserved the
best new artist award she got at the
Grammys, even though Rolling Stone
almost predicted she'd become the
next hot act when it reviewed her first
album early in the year. Her two LPs
furnished the most graceful and fully
realized exposition of soul music of
any albums released last year. Stevie
Wonder hadn't fully awakened from
his synth-pop slumber with "In

Square Circle," and Aretha Franklin
had a couple of classics on her
"Zoomin"' album, but the album
didn't cohere as a whole. Despite the
limitations of Sade's thin voice and
the occasional flimsy lyric, the albums
— both the jumpier "Diamond Life"
and the moodier "Promise" — came
together with a beautiful jazz-pop vi
sion that blasted everything else on
the airwaves out of the water — and
not in an obnoxious way, either.
2. Sting's "The Dream of the Blue
Turtles."
Another exquisite jazz-pop album
that overcame the pomposity of
Sting's lyrical vision with peerless
musicianship. Sure, "Children's
Crusade" was inflated with self
importance, but with a musical in
terlude like that, who cares?
3. Artists United Against Apartheid's
"Sun City."
A breathtaking album that
overcame the barriers radio format
ting puts on music and told the world
that cause music can be good, too.
Buy this album and listen to the Gil
Scott-Heron rap on "Let Me See
Your r.D." and the explosive jazz in
strumental ("The Struggle Contin
ues") — and then put the cassette on
your boom box and blast this brilliant
LP in Brother Jed's face.
4. Talking Heads' "Little Creatures."
Probably the most self-effacing and
warmhearted album of the year. It's
worth it to have this album for the
cover alone, but the music is terrific:
you can dance to it, you can ponder
the lyrics without getting a headache,
and you can even laugh at it.
5. Rush's "Power Windows."
The most subtle and understated
power rock album of the year, this ef
fort by the Canadian trio was un
afraid of intellectuality and willing to
transcend the group's earlier bombast

in favor of a friendlier, and ultimately
more human, approach to guitar
work that made Motley Crue and
Kiss seem even more insipid than
they already are.
6. Prince's "America'VSheila E.'s "A
Love Bizarre'VSimple Minds' "Don't
You (Forget About Me)."
OK, so none of these are albums,
and I couldn't decide which of these
was the best dance single. Why
quibble when everything on the table
is good?
7. The Smiths' "Meat Is Murder."
This was a woefully unrecognized
but also woefully incoherent album
that managed to look good anyway.
The Smiths still have a long way to
go, but with tracks like "How Soon Is
Now," there clearly isn't that much
room for improvement.
8. Kate Bush's "Hounds of Love."
The bizarre queen of new wave
pop struck again with this wonderful
mix of Celtic ruminativeness and new
wave hard-edgedness that came to
gether at an apex with "Running Up
That Hill (A Deal with God)," a
single I was astonished to hear on pop
stations (and which made everything
around it seem like so much quiche.)
9. New Order's "Low-Life."
It's too bad incoherence plagues
the best British artists, but New Or
der is at least trying. "Love
Vigilantes" and"The Perfect Kiss"
were dance tunes that carried the
weight of the world on their shoulders
without coming across as either self
important or obnoxious. New wave
isn't dead yet.
10. Jesus and Mary Chain's
"Psychocandy."
This Scottish group knows how to
make music that sets your hair on end
and captures you with its intensity at
the same time. Feedback has never
sounded so good.

Another year in the world of rock
'n' roll, that sprightly form of music
the Campus Ministry preachers in
White Plaza and the Washington
Wives so love to despise, has come
and gone. It's time to do some serious

1. Sade's" Diamond Life"/" Promise."
Take your pick. Sade deserved the
best new artist award she got at the
Grammys, even though Rolling Stone
almost predicted she'd become the
next hot act when it reviewed her first
album early in the year. Her two LPs
furnished the most graceful and fully
realized exposition of soul music of
any albums released last year. Stevie
Wonder hadn't fully awakened from
his synth-pop slumber with "In

Square Circle," and Aretha Franklin
had a couple of classics on her
"Zoomin"' album, but the album
didn't cohere as a whole. Despite the
limitations of Sade's thin voice and
the occasional flimsy lyric, the albums
— both the jumpier "Diamond Life"
and the moodier "Promise" — came
together with a beautiful jazz-pop vi
sion that blasted everything else on
the airwaves out of the water — and
not in an obnoxious way, either.
2. Sting's "The Dream of the Blue
Turtles."
Another exquisite jazz-pop album
that overcame the pomposity of
Sting's lyrical vision with peerless
musicianship. Sure, "Children's
Crusade" was inflated with self
importance, but with a musical in
terlude like that, who cares?
3. Artists United Against Apartheid's
"Sun City."
A breathtaking album that
overcame the barriers radio format
ting puts on music and told the world
that cause music can be good, too.
Buy this album and listen to the Gil
Scott-Heron rap on "Let Me See
Your r.D." and the explosive jazz in
strumental ("The Struggle Contin
ues") — and then put the cassette on
your boom box and blast this brilliant
LP in Brother Jed's face.
4. Talking Heads' "Little Creatures."
Probably the most self-effacing and
warmhearted album of the year. It's
worth it to have this album for the
cover alone, but the music is terrific:
you can dance to it, you can ponder
the lyrics without getting a headache,
and you can even laugh at it.
5. Rush's "Power Windows."
The most subtle and understated
power rock album of the year, this ef
fort by the Canadian trio was un
afraid of intellectuality and willing to
transcend the group's earlier bombast

in favor of a friendlier, and ultimately
more human, approach to guitar
work that made Motley Crue and
Kiss seem even more insipid than
they already are.
6. Prince's "America'VSheila E.'s "A
Love Bizarre'VSimple Minds' "Don't
You (Forget About Me)."
OK, so none of these are albums,
and I couldn't decide which of these
was the best dance single. Why
quibble when everything on the table
is good?
7. The Smiths' "Meat Is Murder."
This was a woefully unrecognized
but also woefully incoherent album
that managed to look good anyway.
The Smiths still have a long way to
go, but with tracks like "How Soon Is
Now," there clearly isn't that much
room for improvement.
8. Kate Bush's "Hounds of Love."
The bizarre queen of new wave
pop struck again with this wonderful
mix of Celtic ruminativeness and new
wave hard-edgedness that came to
gether at an apex with "Running Up
That Hill (A Deal with God)," a
single I was astonished to hear on pop
stations (and which made everything
around it seem like so much quiche.)
9. New Order's "Low-Life."
It's too bad incoherence plagues
the best British artists, but New Or
der is at least trying. "Love
Vigilantes" and"The Perfect Kiss"
were dance tunes that carried the
weight of the world on their shoulders
without coming across as either self
important or obnoxious. New wave
isn't dead yet.
10. Jesus and Mary Chain's
"Psychocandy."
This Scottish group knows how to
make music that sets your hair on end
and captures you with its intensity at
the same time. Feedback has never
sounded so good.

Another year in the world of rock
'n' roll, that sprightly form of music
the Campus Ministry preachers in
White Plaza and the Washington
Wives so love to despise, has come
and gone. It's time to do some serious
assessment here.
If you read Steve Vineberg's
review of 1985 in film on page 7,
you'll come away with the impression
that it was one of the worst years for
film in a long time. Well, I'm not
going to be nearly so pessimistic in
my diatribe, but I will get the gripes
out of the way before I get to the
goodies.
Blame it on Cain
This was a bad year for at least a
couple of artists who made critical
landslides with their earlier work.
Prince and X, who consistently
delivered excellent punches with the
1 1 albums they recorded between
them from 1978 to 1984, fell victims
to their own virtuosity in 1985.
Prince's "Around the World in a
Day" created a furor when it was
released in April — KZSU went ab
solutely gaga over it, and it eventually
went No. 1 on the pop charts —
became rather tiring rather quickly.
Prince is at his best when he examines
sexuality, and he tends to become
bombastic and weak lyrically when he
writes songs about communism and
mushroom clouds and rich Parisian
floozies.
Whereas Prince fell flat on his face
last year with bad songwriting, the
erstwhile critics' favorites from Los
Angeles, X, went into the strato
sphere with overblown musical ar
rangements that buried otherwise in
teresting lyrics. "Ain't Love Grand"
(with its amusing promo shot of

Exene Cervenka posing in a potato
sack) was a prime example of how not
to produce an album: X brought in a
mainsteam producer to turn their
music into pop radio material, and he
got Billy Zoom's magnificently un
derstated guitar sound in his power
pop hands and turned it into over
blown, bland kitsch.
Grammy garbage and glory
The Grammy awards Tuesday
night didn't do much to encourage
original artists to pursue their visions,
either (not that anyone expected
them to). This was the year of cause
music with a capital C, and the
Grammy voters knew they had to
give the award for both record and
song of the year to USA for Africa's
grandiose "We Are the World."
(Michael Jackson, accepting one of
the statues for the fund-raising group,
said God inspired him and Lionel
Richie to write the song, to give you
some idea of the enormous metap
horical weight thrown behind this one
piece of standard pop fluff.)
Album of the year was, sadly but
predictably enough, Phil Collins' "No
Jacket Required" — a very listenable
but also very conventional collection
of dance pop by a former art-rock
icon. Collins also got a trophy for best
male pop vocal; his female counter
part was Whitney Houston ("Saving
All My Love for You"), whose
precise vocals were all over the
airwaves last year. Best pop group
vocal was "We Are the World" once
again.
In the rock category, the voters
gave statues to Don Henley ("Money
for Nothing"), Tina Turner ("One of
the Living," from the
"Thunderdome" soundtrack) and
Dire Straits ("Money for Nothing").
Rhythm and blues awards went to

Stevie Wonder ("In Square Circle"),
Aretha Franklin ("Freeway of
Love") and the Commodores ("Night
Shift").
Now I'm just amused
In a year when pop radio continued
its foray into nothingness, when soul
radio opened its doors to a whole
gaggle of Prince imitators and fled
glings, when a lot of rock radio either
reformatted itself to play oldies or to
bow down to the spangled tribe of
heavy metal artists that never go

away, there were still some good mo
ments.
Which brings me to the 10 albums I
thought were the best of last year's
crop. To give you an idea of what crit
ics across the country thought, these
were the 10 albums voted as best of
the year in the Village Voice's annual
poll:
1. Talking Heads' "Little
Creatures"
2. The Replacements' "Tim"

3. John Cougar Mellencamp's
"Scarecrow"
4. Tom Waits' "Rain Dogs"
5. Artists United Against Apart
heid's "Sun City"
6. Husker Du's "Flip Your Wig"
7. R.E.M.'s "Fables of the
Reconstruction"
8. Husker Du's "New Day Rising"

delivered excellent punches with the
1 1 albums they recorded between
them from 1978 to 1984, fell victims
to their own virtuosity in 1985.
Prince's "Around the World in a
Day" created a furor when it was
released in April — KZSU went ab
solutely gaga over it, and it eventually
went No. 1 on the pop charts —
became rather tiring rather quickly.
Prince is at his best when he examines
sexuality, and he tends to become
bombastic and weak lyrically when he
writes songs about communism and
mushroom clouds and rich Parisian
floozies.
Whereas Prince fell flat on his face
last year with bad songwriting, the
erstwhile critics' favorites from Los
Angeles, X, went into the strato
sphere with overblown musical ar
rangements that buried otherwise in
teresting lyrics. "Ain't Love Grand"
(with its amusing promo shot of

Exene Cervenka posing in a potato
sack) was a prime example of how not
to produce an album: X brought in a
mainsteam producer to turn their
music into pop radio material, and he
got Billy Zoom's magnificently un
derstated guitar sound in his power
pop hands and turned it into over
blown, bland kitsch.
Grammy garbage and glory
The Grammy awards Tuesday
night didn't do much to encourage
original artists to pursue their visions,
either (not that anyone expected
them to). This was the year of cause
music with a capital C, and the
Grammy voters knew they had to
give the award for both record and
song of the year to USA for Africa's
grandiose "We Are the World."
(Michael Jackson, accepting one of
the statues for the fund-raising group,
said God inspired him and Lionel
Richie to write the song, to give you
some idea of the enormous metap
horical weight thrown behind this one
piece of standard pop fluff.)
Album of the year was, sadly but
predictably enough, Phil Collins' "No
Jacket Required" — a very listenable
but also very conventional collection
of dance pop by a former art-rock
icon. Collins also got a trophy for best
male pop vocal; his female counter
part was Whitney Houston ("Saving
All My Love for You"), whose
precise vocals were all over the
airwaves last year. Best pop group
vocal was "We Are the World" once
again.
In the rock category, the voters
gave statues to Don Henley ("Money
for Nothing"), Tina Turner ("One of
the Living," from the
"Thunderdome" soundtrack) and
Dire Straits ("Money for Nothing").
Rhythm and blues awards went to

Stevie Wonder ("In Square Circle"),
Aretha Franklin ("Freeway of
Love") and the Commodores ("Night
Shift").
Now I'm just amused
In a year when pop radio continued
its foray into nothingness, when soul
radio opened its doors to a whole
gaggle of Prince imitators and fled
glings, when a lot of rock radio either
reformatted itself to play oldies or to
bow down to the spangled tribe of
heavy metal artists that never go

away, there were still some good mo
ments.
Which brings me to the 10 albums I
thought were the best of last year's
crop. To give you an idea of what crit
ics across the country thought, these
were the 10 albums voted as best of
the year in the Village Voice's annual
poll:
1. Talking Heads' "Little
Creatures"
2. The Replacements' "Tim"

3. John Cougar Mellencamp's
"Scarecrow"
4. Tom Waits' "Rain Dogs"
5. Artists United Against Apart
heid's "Sun City"
6. Husker Du's "Flip Your Wig"
7. R.E.M.'s "Fables of the
Reconstruction"
8. Husker Du's "New Day Rising"
9. Aretha Franklin's "Who's
Zoomin' Who"
10. John Fogerty's "Centerfield"
Now here's my list:

1. Sade's" Diamond Life"/" Promise."
Take your pick. Sade deserved the
best new artist award she got at the
Grammys, even though Rolling Stone
almost predicted she'd become the
next hot act when it reviewed her first
album early in the year. Her two LPs
furnished the most graceful and fully
realized exposition of soul music of
any albums released last year. Stevie
Wonder hadn't fully awakened from
his synth-pop slumber with "In

Square Circle," and Aretha Franklin
had a couple of classics on her
"Zoomin"' album, but the album
didn't cohere as a whole. Despite the
limitations of Sade's thin voice and
the occasional flimsy lyric, the albums
— both the jumpier "Diamond Life"
and the moodier "Promise" — came
together with a beautiful jazz-pop vi
sion that blasted everything else on
the airwaves out of the water — and
not in an obnoxious way, either.
2. Sting's "The Dream of the Blue
Turtles."
Another exquisite jazz-pop album
that overcame the pomposity of
Sting's lyrical vision with peerless
musicianship. Sure, "Children's
Crusade" was inflated with self
importance, but with a musical in
terlude like that, who cares?
3. Artists United Against Apartheid's
"Sun City."
A breathtaking album that
overcame the barriers radio format
ting puts on music and told the world
that cause music can be good, too.
Buy this album and listen to the Gil
Scott-Heron rap on "Let Me See
Your r.D." and the explosive jazz in
strumental ("The Struggle Contin
ues") — and then put the cassette on
your boom box and blast this brilliant
LP in Brother Jed's face.
4. Talking Heads' "Little Creatures."
Probably the most self-effacing and
warmhearted album of the year. It's
worth it to have this album for the
cover alone, but the music is terrific:
you can dance to it, you can ponder
the lyrics without getting a headache,
and you can even laugh at it.
5. Rush's "Power Windows."
The most subtle and understated
power rock album of the year, this ef
fort by the Canadian trio was un
afraid of intellectuality and willing to
transcend the group's earlier bombast

in favor of a friendlier, and ultimately
more human, approach to guitar
work that made Motley Crue and
Kiss seem even more insipid than
they already are.
6. Prince's "America'VSheila E.'s "A
Love Bizarre'VSimple Minds' "Don't
You (Forget About Me)."
OK, so none of these are albums,
and I couldn't decide which of these
was the best dance single. Why
quibble when everything on the table
is good?
7. The Smiths' "Meat Is Murder."
This was a woefully unrecognized
but also woefully incoherent album
that managed to look good anyway.
The Smiths still have a long way to
go, but with tracks like "How Soon Is
Now," there clearly isn't that much
room for improvement.
8. Kate Bush's "Hounds of Love."
The bizarre queen of new wave
pop struck again with this wonderful
mix of Celtic ruminativeness and new
wave hard-edgedness that came to
gether at an apex with "Running Up
That Hill (A Deal with God)," a
single I was astonished to hear on pop
stations (and which made everything
around it seem like so much quiche.)
9. New Order's "Low-Life."
It's too bad incoherence plagues
the best British artists, but New Or
der is at least trying. "Love
Vigilantes" and"The Perfect Kiss"
were dance tunes that carried the
weight of the world on their shoulders
without coming across as either self
important or obnoxious. New wave
isn't dead yet.
10. Jesus and Mary Chain's
"Psychocandy."
This Scottish group knows how to
make music that sets your hair on end
and captures you with its intensity at
the same time. Feedback has never
sounded so good.
