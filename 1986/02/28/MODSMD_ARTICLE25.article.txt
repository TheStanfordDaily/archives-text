The Sorrow and the Pity (1972)
U. C. Theatre, Berkeley
Marcel Orphul's four-and-a-half
hour account of the German occu
pation of France, as seen through
the eyes of the citizens of Clermont-
Ferrand, is probably the most
trenchant and stirring documentary
ever made. It is documentary as
Renoir might have approached it,
and indeed some of the true-life
characters, notably the Grave broth
ers, who fought in the Resistence,
and Pierre Mendes-France, who
escaped from prison, are
Renoiresque figures. The film is
democratic in the purest sense: Or
phuls interviews Anthoney Eden,
Britain's Secretary of War in 1940,
as well as an officer in the French di
vision of the S.S. and a man who
claims he never saw any Germans in
Clermont-Ferrand. This is one of
the rare films that can be said to
have made a contribution to art as
well as our understanding of history.
Plays Wednesday.

Out of Africa (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adapta
tion of Isak Dinesen's memoir suf
fers from an excess of tastefulness
and respect for its subject, and the
two stars Meryl Streep as
Dinesen and Robert Redford as her
lover, Denys Finch Hatton don't
display a single romantic impulse;
they never connect with each other
(or the audience) emotionally. The
movie begins as Dinesen marries the
Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke (a
marvelous Klaus Marie Brandauer)
she seemingly for the title, he
expressedly for the money and
together they start a coffee planta
tion in British East Africa in 1914.
She soon drops this adulterous
playboy husband and becomes in
volved with hunter and guide Finch
Hatton. Dinesen was a skilled
enough writer to engage one emo
tionally at the same time she was
turning her experiences into an un
abashed romantic idyll. Pollack
doesn't display a comparable skill,
and he adamantly refuses to whip up
any excitement or tension.
Streep gives another perfectly
polished, technically accomplished
performance that fails to suggest any
inner life to her character, but the
film's biggest problems lie with
Robert Redford. He has taken to
playing ideals, and here he is meant
to be the wild, unconquerable spirit
of Africa. In this film (as in "The
Natural") Redford floats above the
other actors, swathed in a gauzy
aura that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a
more energetic supporting perfor
mance.

You Can't Take It with You (1938)
Cubberley Auditorium
George S. Kaufman and Moss

Hart wrote a wonderful comedy
about a family of noncomformists
who manage largely to ignore the
Depression, but Frank Capra wasn't
satisfied with it: he had Robert Ris
kin rewrite it in the glorified-little
man mode that was Capra's
trademark. It took the Oscars for
Best Picture and Best Director, but
it's overlong (127 minutes), shame
lessly preachy and not especially
well done. In beefed-up versions of
the hero and heroine roles, Jimmy
Stewart and Jean Arthur salvage
everything they can (Riskin did
write one charming new scene for
them, set in a restaurant), and
Mischa Auer makes a hilarious
Kolenkhov (the Russian dance in
structor). But Lionel Bariymore is
no more convincing as a lovable old
codger here than he would be as a
reprehensible old bastard in Capra's
"It's a Wonderful Life" some years
later. The cast also included Edward
Arnold, Spring Byington, Ann Mil
ler, Samuel S. Hinds, Donald Meek,
H. B. Warner, Halliwell Hobbes,
Mary Forbes, Dub Taylor and Eddie
Anderson.

The Magic Flute (1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera evokes
Dickens, sometimes Shakespeare;
sometimes it parodies opera con
ventions like Peter Brook's
"Beggar's Opera." The Three
Spirits are Christmas choirboys who
descend in a balloon and pelt
Papageno (Haken Hagegard,
dressed in green, with a pageboy
haircut, so that he looks like one of
Robin Hood's men) with snowballs
to avert him from suicide. When
Tamino (Josef Kostlinger) plays his
flute, he attracts an audiences of
charmingly stylized beasts a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion, a
walrus lying on his back, a trio of
possums hanging upside down. Bir
git Nordin plays that imperious
manipulator, the Queen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman gets
amazingly natural performances
from his cast, and the movie, set in
the Drottningholm Court Theatre in
Stockholm, has so much heart that
coming after his dreary psycho
drama "Scenes from a Marriage"
it was practically a rebirth. (It is
also, by the way, one of the few
great children's movies.)
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Amadeus."

Dog Day Afternoon (1975)
Old Firehouse
A1 Pacino gives a great American
performance as a man who robs a
bank, holds hostages against the
entry of the police, and becomes a
pop hero in the process. Not many
roles test an actor's range as much as
this one: the character is both tragic
and complexly funny. If you want to

know why A1 Pacino was generally
considered the best young American
actor in the first half of the 19705,
this is the movie to see. Sidney
Lumet, the director, is in his ele
ment New York comedy/drama
and directs a fine cast (Charles
Durning, Chris Sarandon, John
Cazale and others) with a great deal
of drive. Frank Pierson wrote the
script.
Plays Monday night.

The Best of Times (1986)
Old Mill Six, Mountain View
This wonderful comedy reunites
director Roger Spottiswoode and
writer Ron Shelton, the filmmaking
team that crafted "Under Fire."
Working in the tradition and style of
Preston Sturges (in movies like
"The Miracle at Morgan's Creek"),
Spottiswoode and Shelton serve up
the comic obssesions of an entire
community ; in this case Taft, a small
town perpetually second-best in a
high school football rivalry with its
larger neighbor, Bakersfield. Robin
Williams is the man who dropped
the critical pass in an almost-win
game against Bakersfield 12 years
ago, and his failure is a daily oppres
sion that drives him to restage the
classic match. The cast Williams,
Kurt Russell (as Taft's former quar
terback, Pamela Reed and Holly
Palance in the major roles is the
finest group of comic performers
we've seen in a movie in a very long
time, and Shelton writes witty, per
ceptive, funny dialogue that pokes
fun at the characters at the same
time it humanizes them.
Plays this week.

Dreamchild (1985)
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Gavin Millar directed and Dennis
("Pennies from Heaven") Potter
wrote this fairy tale with an adult
sensibility. Alice Hargreaves (Coral
Browne) arrives in New York in
1932 to celebrate the centenary of
the birth of the Reverend Charles
Dodgson (lan Holm, in flashbacks),
a.k.a. Lewis Carroll. She was the
real-life Alice of Carroll's "Alice in
Wonderland" books, and her arrival
in the New World triggers her ambi
valent recollections of her relation
ship with Dodgson. The movie puts
us inside the old Alice's thought
processes, as she imagines herself as
a child with Dodgson and, in the
movie's most inspired moments,
with his Wonderland creatures.
Through her filtered visions of her
past, we see Dodgson's tremendous
love for her as a child, and his ter
ribly apprehensive genius and wit.
The movie is beautifully crafted,
subtle and intelligent; Millar is most
assured with the transitions from
fantasy to reality to imagined
reality. The filmmakers stumble a
bit with a 1932 romance subplot.
Coral Browne and lan Holm have
never been better, and Amelia
Shankley is enchanting as the preco

cious young Alice; the creatures are
from Jim Henson's muppet shop.
Plays this week.

The Color Purple (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Steven Spielberg directed this
candy-coated adaptation of Alice
Walker's Pulitzer Prize winning
novel, and he transmutes both
Walker's powerful emotional force
and her blatant female chauvinism.
In the book, set among black
sharecroppers in Georgia in 1909,
all of the men are either op
pressively loutish or properly
cowed, and all of the women are
loving, sisterly and long-suffering.
Speilberg doesn't change this basic
dialectic, but he does turn the men
into ineffectual, occasionally comi
cal buffoons, and he gives the ma
terial a "Song of the South" patina.
This is a movie-movie black South,
where even the corn-stalks seem
primed for the camera. Walker's
original characters were little more
than one-dimensional, but what
Spielberg does with them here is still
slightly insulting; he has them falling
through roofs and blowing apart
stoves, and the net result is we care
about them as we might care about
Disney's animated critters. The
mostly faithful screenplay is by
Menno Meyjes, and Whoopi
Goldberg as Celie does as well as
possible under Spielberg's direction.
With Margret Avery, Danny
Glover, Willard Pugh and Oprah
Winfrey, whose heroically powerful
Sophia is the best thing about the
movie.
Plays this week.

Dersu Uzala (1977)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Akira Kurosawa filmed this
picture in Russia; it is about an
amazing old Mongolian who is hired
as scout for a cartographical expedi
tion and his friendship with the chief
of that expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature; he
teaches the Russians how to reap
her benefits without disturbing her
balance. This is a very unusual
movie: sweet natured and yet so
grand visually that it takes one's
breath away. Kurosawa and his pho
tographers make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire so
vivid that Dersu's insistence that
each is the embodiment of an inde
pendent spirit actually seems likely.
Among a number of great sequences
is one that might have been con
ceived by Hans Christian Anderson:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter out
of brush, and as the two men set to
work with apparently superhuman
speed and construct something
strong and astonishingly beautiful
out of nothing, the task takes on a
magical aura.
Plays Thursday with "The Idiot."

With Margret Avery, Danny

Dersu Uzala (1977)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Akira Kurosawa filmed this
picture in Russia; it is about an
amazing old Mongolian who is hired
as scout for a cartographical expedi
tion and his friendship with the chief
of that expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature; he
teaches the Russians how to reap
her benefits without disturbing her
balance. This is a very unusual
movie: sweet natured and yet so
grand visually that it takes one's
breath away. Kurosawa and his pho
tographers make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire so
vivid that Dersu's insistence that
each is the embodiment of an inde
pendent spirit actually seems likely.
Among a number of great sequences
is one that might have been con
ceived by Hans Christian Anderson:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter out
of brush, and as the two men set to
work with apparently superhuman
speed and construct something
strong and astonishingly beautiful
out of nothing, the task takes on a
magical aura.
Plays Thursday with "The Idiot."

The Sorrow and the Pity (1972)
U. C. Theatre, Berkeley
Marcel Orphul's four-and-a-half
hour account of the German occu
pation of France, as seen through
the eyes of the citizens of Clermont-
Ferrand, is probably the most
trenchant and stirring documentary
ever made. It is documentary as
Renoir might have approached it,
and indeed some of the true-life
characters, notably the Grave broth
ers, who fought in the Resistence,
and Pierre Mendes-France, who
escaped from prison, are
Renoiresque figures. The film is
democratic in the purest sense: Or
phuls interviews Anthoney Eden,
Britain's Secretary of War in 1940,
as well as an officer in the French di
vision of the S.S. and a man who
claims he never saw any Germans in
Clermont-Ferrand. This is one of
the rare films that can be said to
have made a contribution to art as
well as our understanding of history.
Plays Wednesday.

Out of Africa (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adapta
tion of Isak Dinesen's memoir suf
fers from an excess of tastefulness
and respect for its subject, and the
two stars Meryl Streep as
Dinesen and Robert Redford as her
lover, Denys Finch Hatton don't
display a single romantic impulse;
they never connect with each other
(or the audience) emotionally. The
movie begins as Dinesen marries the
Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke (a
marvelous Klaus Marie Brandauer)
she seemingly for the title, he
expressedly for the money and
together they start a coffee planta
tion in British East Africa in 1914.
She soon drops this adulterous
playboy husband and becomes in
volved with hunter and guide Finch
Hatton. Dinesen was a skilled
enough writer to engage one emo
tionally at the same time she was
turning her experiences into an un
abashed romantic idyll. Pollack
doesn't display a comparable skill,
and he adamantly refuses to whip up
any excitement or tension.
Streep gives another perfectly
polished, technically accomplished
performance that fails to suggest any
inner life to her character, but the
film's biggest problems lie with
Robert Redford. He has taken to
playing ideals, and here he is meant
to be the wild, unconquerable spirit
of Africa. In this film (as in "The
Natural") Redford floats above the
other actors, swathed in a gauzy
aura that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a
more energetic supporting perfor
mance.

You Can't Take It with You (1938)
Cubberley Auditorium
George S. Kaufman and Moss

Hart wrote a wonderful comedy
about a family of noncomformists
who manage largely to ignore the
Depression, but Frank Capra wasn't
satisfied with it: he had Robert Ris
kin rewrite it in the glorified-little
man mode that was Capra's
trademark. It took the Oscars for
Best Picture and Best Director, but
it's overlong (127 minutes), shame
lessly preachy and not especially
well done. In beefed-up versions of
the hero and heroine roles, Jimmy
Stewart and Jean Arthur salvage
everything they can (Riskin did
write one charming new scene for
them, set in a restaurant), and
Mischa Auer makes a hilarious
Kolenkhov (the Russian dance in
structor). But Lionel Bariymore is
no more convincing as a lovable old
codger here than he would be as a
reprehensible old bastard in Capra's
"It's a Wonderful Life" some years
later. The cast also included Edward
Arnold, Spring Byington, Ann Mil
ler, Samuel S. Hinds, Donald Meek,
H. B. Warner, Halliwell Hobbes,
Mary Forbes, Dub Taylor and Eddie
Anderson.

The Magic Flute (1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera evokes
Dickens, sometimes Shakespeare;
sometimes it parodies opera con
ventions like Peter Brook's
"Beggar's Opera." The Three
Spirits are Christmas choirboys who
descend in a balloon and pelt
Papageno (Haken Hagegard,
dressed in green, with a pageboy
haircut, so that he looks like one of
Robin Hood's men) with snowballs
to avert him from suicide. When
Tamino (Josef Kostlinger) plays his
flute, he attracts an audiences of
charmingly stylized beasts a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion, a
walrus lying on his back, a trio of
possums hanging upside down. Bir
git Nordin plays that imperious
manipulator, the Queen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman gets
amazingly natural performances
from his cast, and the movie, set in
the Drottningholm Court Theatre in
Stockholm, has so much heart that
coming after his dreary psycho
drama "Scenes from a Marriage"
it was practically a rebirth. (It is
also, by the way, one of the few
great children's movies.)
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Amadeus."

Dog Day Afternoon (1975)
Old Firehouse
A1 Pacino gives a great American
performance as a man who robs a
bank, holds hostages against the
entry of the police, and becomes a
pop hero in the process. Not many
roles test an actor's range as much as
this one: the character is both tragic
and complexly funny. If you want to

know why A1 Pacino was generally
considered the best young American
actor in the first half of the 19705,
this is the movie to see. Sidney
Lumet, the director, is in his ele
ment New York comedy/drama
and directs a fine cast (Charles
Durning, Chris Sarandon, John
Cazale and others) with a great deal
of drive. Frank Pierson wrote the
script.
Plays Monday night.

The Best of Times (1986)
Old Mill Six, Mountain View
This wonderful comedy reunites
director Roger Spottiswoode and
writer Ron Shelton, the filmmaking
team that crafted "Under Fire."
Working in the tradition and style of
Preston Sturges (in movies like
"The Miracle at Morgan's Creek"),
Spottiswoode and Shelton serve up
the comic obssesions of an entire
community ; in this case Taft, a small
town perpetually second-best in a
high school football rivalry with its
larger neighbor, Bakersfield. Robin
Williams is the man who dropped
the critical pass in an almost-win
game against Bakersfield 12 years
ago, and his failure is a daily oppres
sion that drives him to restage the
classic match. The cast Williams,
Kurt Russell (as Taft's former quar
terback, Pamela Reed and Holly
Palance in the major roles is the
finest group of comic performers
we've seen in a movie in a very long
time, and Shelton writes witty, per
ceptive, funny dialogue that pokes
fun at the characters at the same
time it humanizes them.
Plays this week.

Dreamchild (1985)
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Gavin Millar directed and Dennis
("Pennies from Heaven") Potter
wrote this fairy tale with an adult
sensibility. Alice Hargreaves (Coral
Browne) arrives in New York in
1932 to celebrate the centenary of
the birth of the Reverend Charles
Dodgson (lan Holm, in flashbacks),
a.k.a. Lewis Carroll. She was the
real-life Alice of Carroll's "Alice in
Wonderland" books, and her arrival
in the New World triggers her ambi
valent recollections of her relation
ship with Dodgson. The movie puts
us inside the old Alice's thought
processes, as she imagines herself as
a child with Dodgson and, in the
movie's most inspired moments,
with his Wonderland creatures.
Through her filtered visions of her
past, we see Dodgson's tremendous
love for her as a child, and his ter
ribly apprehensive genius and wit.
The movie is beautifully crafted,
subtle and intelligent; Millar is most
assured with the transitions from
fantasy to reality to imagined
reality. The filmmakers stumble a
bit with a 1932 romance subplot.
Coral Browne and lan Holm have
never been better, and Amelia
Shankley is enchanting as the preco

cious young Alice; the creatures are
from Jim Henson's muppet shop.
Plays this week.

The Color Purple (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Steven Spielberg directed this
candy-coated adaptation of Alice
Walker's Pulitzer Prize winning
novel, and he transmutes both
Walker's powerful emotional force
and her blatant female chauvinism.
In the book, set among black
sharecroppers in Georgia in 1909,
all of the men are either op
pressively loutish or properly
cowed, and all of the women are
loving, sisterly and long-suffering.
Speilberg doesn't change this basic
dialectic, but he does turn the men
into ineffectual, occasionally comi
cal buffoons, and he gives the ma
terial a "Song of the South" patina.
This is a movie-movie black South,
where even the corn-stalks seem
primed for the camera. Walker's
original characters were little more
than one-dimensional, but what
Spielberg does with them here is still
slightly insulting; he has them falling
through roofs and blowing apart
stoves, and the net result is we care
about them as we might care about
Disney's animated critters. The
mostly faithful screenplay is by
Menno Meyjes, and Whoopi
Goldberg as Celie does as well as
possible under Spielberg's direction.

The movie is beautifully crafted,
subtle and intelligent; Millar is most
assured with the transitions from
fantasy to reality to imagined
reality. The filmmakers stumble a
bit with a 1932 romance subplot.
Coral Browne and lan Holm have
never been better, and Amelia
Shankley is enchanting as the preco

cious young Alice; the creatures are
from Jim Henson's muppet shop.

The Color Purple (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Steven Spielberg directed this
candy-coated adaptation of Alice
Walker's Pulitzer Prize winning
novel, and he transmutes both
Walker's powerful emotional force
and her blatant female chauvinism.
In the book, set among black
sharecroppers in Georgia in 1909,
all of the men are either op
pressively loutish or properly
cowed, and all of the women are
loving, sisterly and long-suffering.
Speilberg doesn't change this basic
dialectic, but he does turn the men
into ineffectual, occasionally comi
cal buffoons, and he gives the ma
terial a "Song of the South" patina.
This is a movie-movie black South,
where even the corn-stalks seem
primed for the camera. Walker's
original characters were little more
than one-dimensional, but what
Spielberg does with them here is still
slightly insulting; he has them falling
through roofs and blowing apart
stoves, and the net result is we care
about them as we might care about
Disney's animated critters. The
mostly faithful screenplay is by
Menno Meyjes, and Whoopi
Goldberg as Celie does as well as
possible under Spielberg's direction.
With Margret Avery, Danny
Glover, Willard Pugh and Oprah
Winfrey, whose heroically powerful
Sophia is the best thing about the
movie.

Dersu Uzala (1977)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Akira Kurosawa filmed this
picture in Russia; it is about an
amazing old Mongolian who is hired
as scout for a cartographical expedi
tion and his friendship with the chief
of that expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature; he
teaches the Russians how to reap
her benefits without disturbing her
balance. This is a very unusual
movie: sweet natured and yet so
grand visually that it takes one's
breath away. Kurosawa and his pho
tographers make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire so
vivid that Dersu's insistence that
each is the embodiment of an inde
pendent spirit actually seems likely.
Among a number of great sequences
is one that might have been con
ceived by Hans Christian Anderson:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter out
of brush, and as the two men set to
work with apparently superhuman
speed and construct something
strong and astonishingly beautiful
out of nothing, the task takes on a
magical aura.
Plays Thursday with "The Idiot."

The Sorrow and the Pity (1972)
U. C. Theatre, Berkeley
Marcel Orphul's four-and-a-half
hour account of the German occu
pation of France, as seen through
the eyes of the citizens of Clermont-
Ferrand, is probably the most
trenchant and stirring documentary
ever made. It is documentary as
Renoir might have approached it,
and indeed some of the true-life
characters, notably the Grave broth
ers, who fought in the Resistence,
and Pierre Mendes-France, who
escaped from prison, are
Renoiresque figures. The film is
democratic in the purest sense: Or
phuls interviews Anthoney Eden,
Britain's Secretary of War in 1940,
as well as an officer in the French di
vision of the S.S. and a man who
claims he never saw any Germans in
Clermont-Ferrand. This is one of
the rare films that can be said to
have made a contribution to art as
well as our understanding of history.
Plays Wednesday.

Out of Africa (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adapta
tion of Isak Dinesen's memoir suf
fers from an excess of tastefulness
and respect for its subject, and the
two stars Meryl Streep as
Dinesen and Robert Redford as her
lover, Denys Finch Hatton don't
display a single romantic impulse;
they never connect with each other
(or the audience) emotionally. The
movie begins as Dinesen marries the
Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke (a
marvelous Klaus Marie Brandauer)
she seemingly for the title, he
expressedly for the money and
together they start a coffee planta
tion in British East Africa in 1914.
She soon drops this adulterous
playboy husband and becomes in
volved with hunter and guide Finch
Hatton. Dinesen was a skilled
enough writer to engage one emo
tionally at the same time she was
turning her experiences into an un
abashed romantic idyll. Pollack
doesn't display a comparable skill,
and he adamantly refuses to whip up
any excitement or tension.
Streep gives another perfectly
polished, technically accomplished
performance that fails to suggest any
inner life to her character, but the
film's biggest problems lie with
Robert Redford. He has taken to
playing ideals, and here he is meant
to be the wild, unconquerable spirit
of Africa. In this film (as in "The
Natural") Redford floats above the
other actors, swathed in a gauzy
aura that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a
more energetic supporting perfor
mance.

You Can't Take It with You (1938)
Cubberley Auditorium
George S. Kaufman and Moss

Hart wrote a wonderful comedy
about a family of noncomformists
who manage largely to ignore the
Depression, but Frank Capra wasn't
satisfied with it: he had Robert Ris
kin rewrite it in the glorified-little
man mode that was Capra's
trademark. It took the Oscars for
Best Picture and Best Director, but
it's overlong (127 minutes), shame
lessly preachy and not especially
well done. In beefed-up versions of
the hero and heroine roles, Jimmy
Stewart and Jean Arthur salvage
everything they can (Riskin did
write one charming new scene for
them, set in a restaurant), and
Mischa Auer makes a hilarious
Kolenkhov (the Russian dance in
structor). But Lionel Bariymore is
no more convincing as a lovable old
codger here than he would be as a
reprehensible old bastard in Capra's
"It's a Wonderful Life" some years
later. The cast also included Edward
Arnold, Spring Byington, Ann Mil
ler, Samuel S. Hinds, Donald Meek,
H. B. Warner, Halliwell Hobbes,
Mary Forbes, Dub Taylor and Eddie
Anderson.

The Magic Flute (1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's
movie of Mozart's last opera evokes
Dickens, sometimes Shakespeare;
sometimes it parodies opera con
ventions like Peter Brook's
"Beggar's Opera." The Three
Spirits are Christmas choirboys who
descend in a balloon and pelt
Papageno (Haken Hagegard,
dressed in green, with a pageboy
haircut, so that he looks like one of
Robin Hood's men) with snowballs
to avert him from suicide. When
Tamino (Josef Kostlinger) plays his
flute, he attracts an audiences of
charmingly stylized beasts a
wide-eyed bear, a mournful lion, a
walrus lying on his back, a trio of
possums hanging upside down. Bir
git Nordin plays that imperious
manipulator, the Queen of the
Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman gets
amazingly natural performances
from his cast, and the movie, set in
the Drottningholm Court Theatre in
Stockholm, has so much heart that
coming after his dreary psycho
drama "Scenes from a Marriage"
it was practically a rebirth. (It is
also, by the way, one of the few
great children's movies.)
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Amadeus."

Dog Day Afternoon (1975)
Old Firehouse
A1 Pacino gives a great American
performance as a man who robs a
bank, holds hostages against the
entry of the police, and becomes a
pop hero in the process. Not many
roles test an actor's range as much as
this one: the character is both tragic
and complexly funny. If you want to

know why A1 Pacino was generally
considered the best young American
actor in the first half of the 19705,
this is the movie to see. Sidney
Lumet, the director, is in his ele
ment New York comedy/drama
and directs a fine cast (Charles
Durning, Chris Sarandon, John
Cazale and others) with a great deal
of drive. Frank Pierson wrote the
script.
Plays Monday night.

The Best of Times (1986)
Old Mill Six, Mountain View
This wonderful comedy reunites
director Roger Spottiswoode and
writer Ron Shelton, the filmmaking
team that crafted "Under Fire."
Working in the tradition and style of
Preston Sturges (in movies like
"The Miracle at Morgan's Creek"),
Spottiswoode and Shelton serve up
the comic obssesions of an entire
community ; in this case Taft, a small
town perpetually second-best in a
high school football rivalry with its
larger neighbor, Bakersfield. Robin
Williams is the man who dropped
the critical pass in an almost-win
game against Bakersfield 12 years
ago, and his failure is a daily oppres
sion that drives him to restage the
classic match. The cast Williams,
Kurt Russell (as Taft's former quar
terback, Pamela Reed and Holly
Palance in the major roles is the
finest group of comic performers
we've seen in a movie in a very long
time, and Shelton writes witty, per
ceptive, funny dialogue that pokes
fun at the characters at the same
time it humanizes them.
Plays this week.

Dreamchild (1985)
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Gavin Millar directed and Dennis
("Pennies from Heaven") Potter
wrote this fairy tale with an adult
sensibility. Alice Hargreaves (Coral
Browne) arrives in New York in
1932 to celebrate the centenary of
the birth of the Reverend Charles
Dodgson (lan Holm, in flashbacks),
a.k.a. Lewis Carroll. She was the
real-life Alice of Carroll's "Alice in
Wonderland" books, and her arrival
in the New World triggers her ambi
valent recollections of her relation
ship with Dodgson. The movie puts
us inside the old Alice's thought
processes, as she imagines herself as
a child with Dodgson and, in the
movie's most inspired moments,
with his Wonderland creatures.
Through her filtered visions of her
past, we see Dodgson's tremendous
love for her as a child, and his ter
ribly apprehensive genius and wit.
The movie is beautifully crafted,
subtle and intelligent; Millar is most
assured with the transitions from
fantasy to reality to imagined
reality. The filmmakers stumble a
bit with a 1932 romance subplot.
