# Diversions
## Take a cruise on the wild side — all aboard! 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN 
The ship's giant horn blasts, the confetti
and streamers fly, the lines are tossed off and
you are away. For the next seven fun-filled
days you are sailing aboard one of Carnival
Cruise Lines' five sparkling ships.
Cruising today is completely different than
it was 20 years ago. No longer are all ships
filled with elderly passengers whose idea of
excitement is gossiping over the winner of the
day's session of bingo.
Today the cruise market is dominated by
new cruise lines that use non-stop fun and
excitement, along with lower fares, to lure
new younger passengers. Carnival Cruise
Lines' "Fun Ships" dominate this new action
cruise market.
Carnival's unique marketing strategy has
transformed cruising between ports from just
a relaxing way to travel into a vibrant, total
recreation experience. The traditional bingo
and shuffleboard games are still intact, but
Carnival has added such zany activities as
beer drinking contests and a male nightgown
pageant. In the weekly nightgown spectacle,
male passengers dress in drag for the
"privilege" of being crowned "Miss Male
Nightgown" of the cruise.
While the majority of all cruise ship pas
sengers are still of the older, retired set, Car
nival leads the market in attracting young,
first-time cruisers. With the advent of newer,
larger ships, young people can be almost sure
to find plenty of fellow revelers to fill the dis
cos and bars until the wee hours.
Carnival's five ships still have the tradi
tional service, gala meals and nightclub
shows, but added are non-stop discos and late
night bars. On most voyages the disco will be
packed until 3:00 a.m. when the action moves
to one of the "after-hours" bars which usually
stay open at least until 5:00 a.m.
Start your day with a morning exercise class
or enjoy a brisk jog around the sun-filled
deck. As the day progresses, the ship comes
alive with activity.
Each day a two-page, single-spaced typed
newsletter is filled with non-stop events.
Skeet shooting, shuffleboard, golfing and card
games, along with hundreds of other activites
are featured. However, the favorite pastime is
still simply enjoying the tropical sunshine and
a cool drink from a comfortable deckchair
near one of the swimming pools.
As today's modern liners tend to carry
thousands of passengers of all ages, there are
places for everyone. On Carnival's new super
liner M/S Holiday there are three outdoor
swimming pools.
The Lido Deck pool with its huge water
slide tends to attract the 20s to 30s crowd. For
those preferring to get away from the blast of
nearby tape decks, the Wharf Pool provides a
quiet place to relax and read. Meanwhile, the
third pool down on America Deck is just for
kids.

If you are worried about going hungry —
never fear. All Carnival Ships serve nine
meals each day!
From the "early-risers" breakfast at 5:30
a.m. until the late night buffet at 2:00 a.m.,
the endless stream of tempting delicacies
never ends. Main meals are served in two
seatings in the dining room, while casual
lunches and snacks are available on deck.
All Carnival ships have 24-hour room ser
vice. All meals, including room service are in
cluded in the price of a ticket. The second or
late seating is the most popular, especially
with younger and single passengers who want
to be able to enjoy the ship's nightlife. Re
quests for late seating dinner on any cruise
should be made as early as possible.
Evenings aboard Carnival ships are alive
with activity. After dinner there are several
nightclub shows to choose from, featuring
comedy, song, magic and dance. The disco

opens each night at 10:00 p.m. and stays ac
tive until the wee hours. Or, if you prefer,
dance to the sounds of the ship's three or
chestras and bands.
All of Carnival's ships have full service
casinos — the M/S Holiday's "Gaming Club"
is the largest casino afloat.
Carnival Cruises ships have become so
popular that virtually every sailing is sold out
by departure time. The line has two new su
perliners currently under construction in
Malmo, Sweden. The two ships, M/S Jubilee
and M/S Celebration, will carry 1,48b pas
sengers each.
The Jubilee is scheduled to enter service on
July 6 and will sail on seven-day cruises from
Miami to Cozumel, Grand Cayman and
Jamaica. By the end of 1987, with the com
pletion of the Celebration, Carnival Cruise
Lines will carry over half a million passengers
each year.

While each of Carnival's ships has the same
casual atmosphere, each also has its own spe
cial magic.
The brand new superliner M/S Holiday
boasts a jazz club, the "Tahiti Lounge," with
some of the most exotic drinks anywhere. Or,
if you prefer, head for "Rick's Cafe Ameri
can," a piano bar right out of Bogart's
"Casablanca". The "Wharf Bar and Grill"
where casual lunch and snacks are served in
cludes three lifesized tugboats as serving lines.
The Holiday can accommodate up to 1,760
passengers and 660 crew members. She
cruises the Caribbean on a weekly itinerary
from Miami to St. Maarten, St. Thomas and
Nassau. The Holiday earned the Total
Traveler By Ship (TTS) "Best Ship Award for
1985." She is best described as beautiful, new
and fun.
The fleet's second newest ship, M/S
Tropicale, entered service in 1982 and carries

1,400 passengers and 550 crew members. She
leaves Los Angeles (San Pedro pier) each
Sunday for the Mexican Riviera ports of Cabo
San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan.
Ninety-five percent of her cabins feature twin
beds that convert into full king-sized beds.
Amenities include the huge Exta-Z Discot
heque, Paradise Club Casino and beautiful
"Islands in the Sun Lounge." TTS gave the
Tropicale five stars in the areas of food, enter
tainment and activites.
Carnival's third ship is the TSS Festivale
(originally built in 1961 as the Transval
Castle). She can carry up to 1,400 passengers
and 580 crew members on seven-day Carib
bean cruises from Miami to Nassau, San Juan
and St. Thomas. This ship has been totally
rebuilt and maintains the old-world glamour
in a modern cruising market.
