# Special cruise rates give singles time to mingle and prosper

If you are single, there is good news
for you in the area of discount cruises.
Gramercy Travel System's
Singleworld Cruises offers below
tariff prices on numerous cruises. The
company attempts to bring single
cruise passengers together by buying
large blocks of space from the cruise
lines and then reselling to passengers
at discount prices.
Advantages of traveling on a
Singleworld package include
guaranteed share rates on cabins,
guaranteed second seating dining ar
rangements, special optional shore
activities, a free welcome-aboard
cocktail party and often below-tariff
discount rates.
According to Operations Manager
Wendy Lowenstein, Singleworld is
definitely not a dating service. "We
simply try to bring singles together to
share in the fun," she said. Single pas
sengers can often feel lost among the
majority of married passengers.
Singleworld reserves a section of the
dining room and thus guarantees that
members will sit with other singles at
the preferred second seating. The
company also offers guaranteed share
cabin rates.
Thus, if you're traveling alone or
with a friend and you want to enjoy
the quad discount rates, Singleworld
will find you roommates. If
Singleworld is unable to find suitable
roommates, passengers are
guaranteed the share rate.
The company offers different age
groupings for different sailings.

About half of all Singleworld
departures are limited to passengers
under 35 years old. On sailings listed
as "open to all ages" most passengers
will be in the 40-plus age range.
Singleworld sends a representative
on all cruises to help set up parties,
make suggestions on what to do while
in port or just solve problems that
may arise.

The best buy for Stanford area pas
sengers is Carnival's Tropicale sailing
from Los Angeles to Mexico.
Singleworld offers quad cabin rates
(without airfare) of $575 on all Car
nival ships. Caribbean cruise rates
start at only $475 for a seven-day
cruise (quad-rate without airfare
aboard the Carla Costa).
Singleworld offers discount rates
and guaranteed shares on Carnival,
Norwegian Caribbean, Costa,
Bahama, Home and Paquet cruise
lines. Since 1957, more than 174,000
singles have paid the $18 member
ship fee to book a vacation through
Singleworld.
