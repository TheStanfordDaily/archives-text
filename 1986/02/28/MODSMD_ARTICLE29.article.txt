## Stanford canned again on ESPN, 74-60 Veteran OSU squad hits 63 percent to beat Cardinal 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Usually, as winter's first cold blasts whip
through the newly barren trees, birds fly to
warmer climes until spring returns.
The Stanford Cardinal chose to wait until the
warmth of spring made its first appearance
before it went south. The Stanford men's bas
ketball team turned in a listless performance
last night and dropped a 74-60 decision to
Oregon State before 5,033 at Maples Pavilion
and a national television audience on ESPN.
"I don't think we were ready for the game
today," guard John Paye said, "Maybe the
spring weather had an effect or something. We
just weren't ready."
"That's as fine a game as I've seen played in
this league," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said,
choosing to dwell on the positive — Oregon
State's performance. "I think it was more a case
of running into a senior ballclub playing real
well. They showed their experience in respond
ing to conditions on the court, the changing
calls.
"Oregon State played good defense, and that
was the most contact allowed that I've seen all
season, and they adjusted to it better than we
did."
"This was a good game for our seniors,"
Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller said. "The
seniors had something to prove tonight. Stan
ford completely dominated us in our first game,
and our seniors knew it."
The turning point seemed to come when
Stanford guard Todd Lichti picked up his third
foul with 7:18 left in the first half. Davis sat
Lichti down, and Oregon State outscored the
Cardinal 16-6 in the next seven minutes to take
a 36-24 halftime lead.
"You saw what happened when he's out of
there," Davis said of his star freshman. "In the
first half he's out, and we don't know where to
turn."
Despite playing only 27 minutes, Lichti had a
game-high 19 points and four steals.
With Stanford trailing by 14 midway through
the second half, Lichti led the Cardinal as it
played its only inspired basketball of the game.
After he hit a 15-foot jumper and converted a
midcourt steal into a layin, Keith Ramee made a
pair of free throws to cut the deficit to 58-50.
The Cardinal then cut it to seven on a layin by

Andy Fischer, but could come no closer.
Stanford still trailed 63-56 with 3:29 to play,
but couldn't get the shots to fall when they were
needed, and Oregon State outscored the Card
inal 11-4 the rest of the way.

The Cardinal defense shut down the Beavers
inside, but was again riddled from the outside.
Center Jose Ortiz, who came into last night
averaging almost 17 points per game, was held
to just six points and three rebounds, and he
was also in foul trouble most of the game.
Meanwhile, guard Darrin Houston and for
wards Tyrone Miller and Steve Woodside
combined for 51 points. Miller and Houston
both had 18 to lead the Beavers, and Woodside

contributed 15 points and 10 assists.
Stanford's 3-2 zone has been vulnerable to
outside shooters, and Davis changed the zone at
times into a man-to-man. "We didn't feel we
were in bad defensive position," Davis said.
"The problem with the man was that we got into
foul trouble. The problem with the zone was we
couldn't get to the shooters."
Oregon State shot 67 percent in the first half
and 63 percent for the game. Stanford hit only
44 percent of its shots.
Stanford also got no scoring from the center
position. Howard Wright in 32 minutes and Eric
Reveno in eight combined for zero points.
Wright did pull down nine rebounds, and he did
help shut down Ortiz, but offensively he missed
three shots and committed six turnovers.
"They pushed him around in there," Davis
said, "and he's not capable of handling it. They
took him right out of his game."
Forward Greg Butler had another solid game,
scoring 15 points and grabbing six rebounds,
and guard Keith Ramee had one of his better
offensive nights, scoring 14 points and dealing
eight assists.
Unfortunately for Stanford, only five players
could manage to score from the floor.
The Cardinal also was hampered by foul trou
ble. In addition to Lichti, Ramee and Wright
both played with four personals, and Fischer
fouled out.
Both teams played sloppily, each committing
19 turnovers. Stanford had eight steals, while
Oregon State had nine.
The loss drops Stanford into sixth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 7-8 record. The
Cardinal is 13-14 overall. Oregon State im
proves to 8-7 and 12-11, good for a fourth
place tie with UCLA, which was idle.
The loss also puts an almost definitive end to
any hopes of a berth in the National Invitational
Tournament. With California in third place with
a two-game lead over Stanford and UCLA as
the defending champion, the Cardinal would
have to finish ahead of both those teams as well
as the Beavers.
The Cardinal needs to win its final three
games — at home against USC tomorrow and
next weekend at Washington and Washington
State — to finish with its first winning record in
the conference since 1966, when it finished
third at 8-6. Stanford's best since then is fourth
place at 7-7 in 1973, when the conference was
the Pac-8.

The only men capable of stopping Todd Lichti from scoring last night were
wearing black and white striped shirts, not orange jerseys. Lichti led the Card

The only men capable of stopping Todd Lichti from scoring last night were
wearing black and white striped shirts, not orange jerseys. Lichti led the Card
inal with 19 points, but was limited to only 27 minutes of playing time because of
foul trouble.
Usually, as winter's first cold blasts whip
through the newly barren trees, birds fly to
warmer climes until spring returns.
The Stanford Cardinal chose to wait until the
warmth of spring made its first appearance
before it went south. The Stanford men's bas
ketball team turned in a listless performance
last night and dropped a 74-60 decision to
Oregon State before 5,033 at Maples Pavilion
and a national television audience on ESPN.
"I don't think we were ready for the game
today," guard John Paye said, "Maybe the
spring weather had an effect or something. We
just weren't ready."
"That's as fine a game as I've seen played in
this league," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said,
choosing to dwell on the positive — Oregon
State's performance. "I think it was more a case
of running into a senior ballclub playing real
well. They showed their experience in respond
ing to conditions on the court, the changing
calls.
"Oregon State played good defense, and that
was the most contact allowed that I've seen all
season, and they adjusted to it better than we
did."
"This was a good game for our seniors,"
Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller said. "The
seniors had something to prove tonight. Stan
ford completely dominated us in our first game,
and our seniors knew it."
The turning point seemed to come when
Stanford guard Todd Lichti picked up his third
foul with 7:18 left in the first half. Davis sat
Lichti down, and Oregon State outscored the
Cardinal 16-6 in the next seven minutes to take
a 36-24 halftime lead.
"You saw what happened when he's out of
there," Davis said of his star freshman. "In the
first half he's out, and we don't know where to
turn."
Despite playing only 27 minutes, Lichti had a
game-high 19 points and four steals.
With Stanford trailing by 14 midway through
the second half, Lichti led the Cardinal as it
played its only inspired basketball of the game.
After he hit a 15-foot jumper and converted a
midcourt steal into a layin, Keith Ramee made a
pair of free throws to cut the deficit to 58-50.
The Cardinal then cut it to seven on a layin by

Andy Fischer, but could come no closer.
Stanford still trailed 63-56 with 3:29 to play,
but couldn't get the shots to fall when they were
needed, and Oregon State outscored the Card
inal 11-4 the rest of the way.

The Cardinal defense shut down the Beavers
inside, but was again riddled from the outside.
Center Jose Ortiz, who came into last night
averaging almost 17 points per game, was held
to just six points and three rebounds, and he
was also in foul trouble most of the game.
Meanwhile, guard Darrin Houston and for
wards Tyrone Miller and Steve Woodside
combined for 51 points. Miller and Houston
both had 18 to lead the Beavers, and Woodside

contributed 15 points and 10 assists.
Stanford's 3-2 zone has been vulnerable to
outside shooters, and Davis changed the zone at
times into a man-to-man. "We didn't feel we
were in bad defensive position," Davis said.
"The problem with the man was that we got into
foul trouble. The problem with the zone was we
couldn't get to the shooters."
Oregon State shot 67 percent in the first half
and 63 percent for the game. Stanford hit only
44 percent of its shots.
Stanford also got no scoring from the center
position. Howard Wright in 32 minutes and Eric
Reveno in eight combined for zero points.
Wright did pull down nine rebounds, and he did
help shut down Ortiz, but offensively he missed
three shots and committed six turnovers.
"They pushed him around in there," Davis
said, "and he's not capable of handling it. They
took him right out of his game."
Forward Greg Butler had another solid game,
scoring 15 points and grabbing six rebounds,
and guard Keith Ramee had one of his better
offensive nights, scoring 14 points and dealing
eight assists.
Unfortunately for Stanford, only five players
could manage to score from the floor.
The Cardinal also was hampered by foul trou
ble. In addition to Lichti, Ramee and Wright
both played with four personals, and Fischer
fouled out.
Both teams played sloppily, each committing
19 turnovers. Stanford had eight steals, while
Oregon State had nine.
The loss drops Stanford into sixth place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 7-8 record. The
Cardinal is 13-14 overall. Oregon State im
proves to 8-7 and 12-11, good for a fourth
place tie with UCLA, which was idle.
The loss also puts an almost definitive end to
any hopes of a berth in the National Invitational
Tournament. With California in third place with
a two-game lead over Stanford and UCLA as
the defending champion, the Cardinal would
have to finish ahead of both those teams as well
as the Beavers.
The Cardinal needs to win its final three
games — at home against USC tomorrow and
next weekend at Washington and Washington
State — to finish with its first winning record in
the conference since 1966, when it finished
third at 8-6. Stanford's best since then is fourth
place at 7-7 in 1973, when the conference was
the Pac-8.

proves to 8-7 and 12-11, good for a fourth
place tie with UCLA, which was idle.
The loss also puts an almost definitive end to
any hopes of a berth in the National Invitational
Tournament. With California in third place with
a two-game lead over Stanford and UCLA as
the defending champion, the Cardinal would
have to finish ahead of both those teams as well
as the Beavers.
The Cardinal needs to win its final three
games — at home against USC tomorrow and
next weekend at Washington and Washington
State — to finish with its first winning record in
the conference since 1966, when it finished
third at 8-6. Stanford's best since then is fourth
place at 7-7 in 1973, when the conference was
the Pac-8.

The only men capable of stopping Todd Lichti from scoring last night were
wearing black and white striped shirts, not orange jerseys. Lichti led the Card
inal with 19 points, but was limited to only 27 minutes of playing time because of
foul trouble.
