# Hospital faces major changes

### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
In many ways, Stanford Hospital is facing a
struggle for good health not unlike the struggle with
which many of its patients must-cope every day.
Hospital officials announced last month that
major cutbacks in the operating budget would have
to be implemented. These cutbacks would total $25
million and require layoffs of up to about 200
employees in both management and nursing.
Stanford isn't just reducing expenses to survive.
Like hospitals across the nation, the University has
embarked on a campaign to strengthen its business
of health care.
But in a recent interview with the San Jose Mer
cury News, University President Donald Kennedy,
chairman of the Board of Hospital Directors, said
university medical centers like Stanford are not as
well-suited as others to compete in the newly com
petitive environment "because of the severity of ill
ness in their patient mix and because of their re
sponsibilities to graduate medical education."
Hospital Director Sheldon King notes that Stan
ford has traditionally emphasized complex medical
problems that fascinate its physicians andresearch
ers. Now. he says the hospital must wage a difficult
battle to attract more business.
"It's not unfair to suggest that academic medical
centers are guilty of intellectual arrogance," King
told the Mercury News recently. "No more."
Although the number of admissions to the hospi
tal has remained relatively steady, the average
length of patient stay has dropped from 13.4 days in
1960 to fewer than seven days during the 1984-85
academic year.
The hospital's base budget has been reduced by
at least $15 million since 1982, and King projects
an increased reduction by more than $15 million in
the $200 million budget over the next few years.
