# Hospital faces major changes
## 
### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
In many ways, Stanford Hospital is facing a
struggle for good health not unlike the struggle with
which many of its patients must-cope every day.
Hospital officials announced last month that
major cutbacks in the operating budget would have
to be implemented. These cutbacks would total $25
million and require layoffs of up to about 200
employees in both management and nursing.
Stanford isn't just reducing expenses to survive.
Like hospitals across the nation, the University has
embarked on a campaign to strengthen its business
of health care.
But in a recent interview with the San Jose Mer
cury News, University President Donald Kennedy,
chairman of the Board of Hospital Directors, said
university medical centers like Stanford are not as
well-suited as others to compete in the newly com
petitive environment "because of the severity of ill
ness in their patient mix and because of their re
sponsibilities to graduate medical education."
Hospital Director Sheldon King notes that Stan
ford has traditionally emphasized complex medical
problems that fascinate its physicians andresearch
ers. Now. he says the hospital must wage a difficult
battle to attract more business.
"It's not unfair to suggest that academic medical
centers are guilty of intellectual arrogance," King
told the Mercury News recently. "No more."
Although the number of admissions to the hospi
tal has remained relatively steady, the average
length of patient stay has dropped from 13.4 days in
1960 to fewer than seven days during the 1984-85
academic year.
The hospital's base budget has been reduced by
at least $15 million since 1982, and King projects
an increased reduction by more than $15 million in
the $200 million budget over the next few years.
With these cuts, many Stanford of
ficials are saying they can no longer
rely merely on the hospital's interna
tional reputation for sophisticated
medical procedures.
Being "a well-known teaching
hospital" has both its advantages and
its disadvantages, according to Hospi
tal Finance Director David Sakai. On

the one hand, Stanford has developed
a credible reputation; on the other,
"There's a notion that our prices are
too expensive," he said.
Since a directive issued by the
Board of Directors in 1982, a year in
which prices rose 22 percent, hospital
managers have been working to hold
down the rate of price increases.
The rate of increase last year was
just under 7.5 percent, and admini
strators are aiming for 5 percent this
year, King said.
While working to cut prices for
patients, hospital officials are seeking
to develop a better sense of customer
relations — and to match more ac
curately trends within the environ
ment.
Ron Hill, hospital director of mar
keting and program development,

said, "The demographics of the popu
lation are changing quite drastically."
In particular, there has been a con
tinuing increase in elderly patients.
Programs to drum up business in
clude:
• Life Flight, an emergency helicop
ter that has been in operation for 18
months.
• The new Trauma Center, designed
for acutely injured patients who need
emergency surgery.
• The Home Care Program, started
one year ago to help discharged

patients who need physical therapy
and nursing care.
• The new Addictive Disorders Cen
ter, a service for both inpatients and
outpatients.
Hospital officials note that many
emerging medical technologies were
not considered when the hospital was
built a quarter century ago. Today,
Sakai said there isn't "enough room
for technology and the patients. We
could not continue to remain a major
university teaching hospital with the
kinds of problems we had in the old

facility."
National health care costs have
skyrocketed from $52 billion to
nearly $400 billion since 1950 and
now account for 10 percent of the
gross national product, as opposed to
4.4 percent 25 years ago.
The reaction to this has led to
major changes in the reimbursement
methods for the treatment of elderly
patients insured through the national
Medicare program and of poor
patients insured through the state's
MediCal program.

According to Sakai, MediCal,
which provides 13 percent of Stan
ford's patients, pays only about 60
percent of the hospital's cost of treat
ing a patient.
In order to keep patient costs
down, Sakai and others agree that
changes must be made in these reim
bursement rates. Medical Center offi
cials have been lobbying organiza
tions such as the Council of Teaching
Hospitals for methods that they
believe would be more fair to aca
demic medical centers.

Kennedy has also lobbied Capitol
Hill as a spokesman for the Associa
tion of American Universities.
"The threat that the university
medical centers face is from a set of
policies that favor cost competition
for the routine stuff and then expect
the university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe illnesses,
many of them in charity patients,
without adequate reimbursement,
and that is a financial formula to kill
the university medical centers," Ken
nedy said.

the $200 million budget over the next few years.
With these cuts, many Stanford of
ficials are saying they can no longer
rely merely on the hospital's interna
tional reputation for sophisticated
medical procedures.
Being "a well-known teaching
hospital" has both its advantages and
its disadvantages, according to Hospi
tal Finance Director David Sakai. On

the one hand, Stanford has developed
a credible reputation; on the other,
"There's a notion that our prices are
too expensive," he said.
Since a directive issued by the
Board of Directors in 1982, a year in
which prices rose 22 percent, hospital
managers have been working to hold
down the rate of price increases.
The rate of increase last year was
just under 7.5 percent, and admini
strators are aiming for 5 percent this
year, King said.
While working to cut prices for
patients, hospital officials are seeking
to develop a better sense of customer
relations — and to match more ac
curately trends within the environ
ment.
Ron Hill, hospital director of mar
keting and program development,

said, "The demographics of the popu
lation are changing quite drastically."
In particular, there has been a con
tinuing increase in elderly patients.
Programs to drum up business in
clude:
• Life Flight, an emergency helicop
ter that has been in operation for 18
months.
• The new Trauma Center, designed
for acutely injured patients who need
emergency surgery.
• The Home Care Program, started
one year ago to help discharged

patients who need physical therapy
and nursing care.
• The new Addictive Disorders Cen
ter, a service for both inpatients and
outpatients.
Hospital officials note that many
emerging medical technologies were
not considered when the hospital was
built a quarter century ago. Today,
Sakai said there isn't "enough room
for technology and the patients. We
could not continue to remain a major
university teaching hospital with the
kinds of problems we had in the old

facility."
National health care costs have
skyrocketed from $52 billion to
nearly $400 billion since 1950 and
now account for 10 percent of the
gross national product, as opposed to
4.4 percent 25 years ago.
The reaction to this has led to
major changes in the reimbursement
methods for the treatment of elderly
patients insured through the national
Medicare program and of poor
patients insured through the state's
MediCal program.

According to Sakai, MediCal,
which provides 13 percent of Stan
ford's patients, pays only about 60
percent of the hospital's cost of treat
ing a patient.
In order to keep patient costs
down, Sakai and others agree that
changes must be made in these reim
bursement rates. Medical Center offi
cials have been lobbying organiza
tions such as the Council of Teaching
Hospitals for methods that they
believe would be more fair to aca
demic medical centers.

Kennedy has also lobbied Capitol
Hill as a spokesman for the Associa
tion of American Universities.
"The threat that the university
medical centers face is from a set of
policies that favor cost competition
for the routine stuff and then expect
the university hospitals to take on the
load of managing the severe illnesses,
many of them in charity patients,
without adequate reimbursement,
and that is a financial formula to kill
the university medical centers," Ken
nedy said.
In many ways, Stanford Hospital is facing a
struggle for good health not unlike the struggle with
which many of its patients must-cope every day.
Hospital officials announced last month that
major cutbacks in the operating budget would have
to be implemented. These cutbacks would total $25
million and require layoffs of up to about 200
employees in both management and nursing.
Stanford isn't just reducing expenses to survive.
Like hospitals across the nation, the University has
embarked on a campaign to strengthen its business
of health care.
But in a recent interview with the San Jose Mer
cury News, University President Donald Kennedy,
chairman of the Board of Hospital Directors, said
university medical centers like Stanford are not as
well-suited as others to compete in the newly com
petitive environment "because of the severity of ill
ness in their patient mix and because of their re
sponsibilities to graduate medical education."
Hospital Director Sheldon King notes that Stan
ford has traditionally emphasized complex medical
problems that fascinate its physicians andresearch
ers. Now. he says the hospital must wage a difficult
battle to attract more business.
"It's not unfair to suggest that academic medical
centers are guilty of intellectual arrogance," King
told the Mercury News recently. "No more."
Although the number of admissions to the hospi
tal has remained relatively steady, the average
length of patient stay has dropped from 13.4 days in
1960 to fewer than seven days during the 1984-85
academic year.
The hospital's base budget has been reduced by
at least $15 million since 1982, and King projects
an increased reduction by more than $15 million in
the $200 million budget over the next few years.
With these cuts, many Stanford of
ficials are saying they can no longer
