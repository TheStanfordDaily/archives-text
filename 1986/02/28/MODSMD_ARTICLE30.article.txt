# Doubles teams deny the Aztecs another upset
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The Stanford doubles teams put
together their best combined effort
of the season to smash the upset
hopes of giant-killing San Diego
State and lead the No. 2 Cardinal
women's tennis team to a 6-3 vic
tory before a sunbathing crowd yes
terday at the Stanford courts.
The 5-0 Cardinal is at home again
today at 1:30 p.m. against No. 7
UCLA.
San Diego State upset top-ranked
USC a week ago in Southern Cali
fornia and had upset on its mind
after splitting with Stanford yester
day in the singles matches. But the
Cardinal dominated the doubles ac
tion.
"I was really pleased," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "When
you win all three doubles matches,
you have to be pleased."
Aztec Coach Carol Plunkett was
obviously dejected by her team's

doubles play. "After splitting the
singles, I anticipated the match
would be 5-4 one way or the other,"
she said. "Six-three was kind of dis
appointing.
"Our doubles have not been won
derful,'" Plunkett added. "We
haven't come up with the combina
tion."
SDSU's prospects looked good
after junior Anne Moeller handled
Stanford freshman Marianne Wer
del easily in the No. 3 singles match,
6-3, 6-0. Werdel, the most highly
touted freshman in the nation,
dropped to 1 -3 in dual match singles
play this season.
"I don't know if it's a slump or
I'm just having trouble adjusting,"
Werdel said. "Before, tennis was
my main concern. Now I have
classes. When you're playing in the
pros, you have a match everyday.
Here, there are only two matches a
week.

After two subpar performances in Arizona last weekend, Patty Fen
dick was at the top of her game yesterday, routing San Diego State's
Monique Javer 6-1, 6-2. "She's back," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said.
"It's just confidence," the 5-foot
-10 freshman added. "In practice I've
played well. But I haven't played well
in matches."
The Cardinal took a 2-1 lead in the
match as juniors Stephanie Savides
and Leigh Anne Eldredge completed
singles victories. Savides rolled over
Aztec freshman Kristin Hill in the
No. 5 match 6-2, 6-1, while Eldredge
knocked off senior Cathy Berry 6-3,
6-0 in the No. 4 match.
Junior Patty Fendick increased the
Stanford lead to 3-1 with a convinc
ing 6-1, 6-2 victory over SDSU's
Monique Javer in the No. 1 singles.
"She's back," Brennan said of Fen
dick, who uncharacteristically lost
twice last week in Arizona. "She had

the home crowd going. She's a per
former."
"Fendick played a great singles
match," Plunkett said. "There's not
much you can do in that situation."
The Aztecs closed out the singles
by winning the last two matches,
however. Senior Cindy MacGregor
was close to perfect in beating Stan
ford freshman Eleni Rossides in the
No. 2 singles, 6-1, 6-4.
In the No. 6 match, Cardinal soph
omore Kay Tittle suffered her first
dual match loss of the season, falling
to junior Dana Bleicher 7-6 (8-6), 6-
2 aifter holding a set point in the first
set tie-breaker.
Tittle and Werdel seemed unaf
fected by their singles losses as they
disposed of Hill and Bleicher in the
No. 3 doubles match, 6-0, 6-3. The
victory gave the Cardinal a 4-3 ad
vantage in the match.
"Kay and I have played real well

together this season," Werdel said
after the match. "We're really confi
dent with the doubles."
After dropping the first set 6-3,
Fendick and Eldredge overwhelmed
Berry and Moeller 6-1, 6-0 in the
final two sets of the No. 1 doubles
match, clinching the victory for Stan
ford.
Savides and sophomore Cari
Hagey completed the doubles sweep
with a 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 victory over
MacGregor and SDSU senior Kelly
Rapp.
Today's match with UCLA will
most likely be decided in the doubles
competition again. "I don't think
we're going to clinch too many
matches in singles," Brennan said.
The weather may also be a factor
today, as the heat is taking a lot out of
the players, according to Brennan.
"I'm just hoping we're not too tired."
