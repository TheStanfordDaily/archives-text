# Doubles teams deny the Aztecs another upset
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The Stanford doubles teams put
together their best combined effort
of the season to smash the upset
hopes of giant-killing San Diego
State and lead the No. 2 Cardinal
women's tennis team to a 6-3 vic
tory before a sunbathing crowd yes
terday at the Stanford courts.
The 5-0 Cardinal is at home again
today at 1:30 p.m. against No. 7
UCLA.
San Diego State upset top-ranked
USC a week ago in Southern Cali
fornia and had upset on its mind
after splitting with Stanford yester
day in the singles matches. But the
Cardinal dominated the doubles ac
tion.
"I was really pleased," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "When
you win all three doubles matches,
you have to be pleased."
Aztec Coach Carol Plunkett was
obviously dejected by her team's

doubles play. "After splitting the
singles, I anticipated the match
would be 5-4 one way or the other,"
she said. "Six-three was kind of dis
appointing.
"Our doubles have not been won
derful,'" Plunkett added. "We
haven't come up with the combina
tion."
SDSU's prospects looked good
after junior Anne Moeller handled
Stanford freshman Marianne Wer
del easily in the No. 3 singles match,
6-3, 6-0. Werdel, the most highly
touted freshman in the nation,
dropped to 1 -3 in dual match singles
play this season.
"I don't know if it's a slump or
I'm just having trouble adjusting,"
Werdel said. "Before, tennis was
my main concern. Now I have
classes. When you're playing in the
pros, you have a match everyday.
Here, there are only two matches a
week.

After two subpar performances in Arizona last weekend, Patty Fen
dick was at the top of her game yesterday, routing San Diego State's
Monique Javer 6-1, 6-2. "She's back," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said.
