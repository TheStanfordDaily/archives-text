# USC visits Maples in '86 home finale
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
What a difference a year makes. Last season, the USC men's basketball
team went 19-10, 13-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference, tied Washington for the
Pac-10championship and received a berth in the NCAA tournament.
The USC team that visits Stanford tomorrow for a 3 p.m. contest at Maples
Pavilion is in a vastly different condition.
In 12 months the Trojans have gone from the penthouse to the outhouse.
USC is 4-11 this season in the Pac-10. 10-15 overall, and only a half-game
ahead of last-place Oregon.
And forward Derrick Dowell has gone into the doghouse of Coach Stan
Morrison. In Monday night's 65-63 Trojan loss to California, Dowell told a
USC assistant coach that he didn't want to start the half after being benched
with three fouls in the first half.
Morrison obliged Dowell by not playing him the entire second half. Cal won
the contest and gained a one-game lead on Stanford when guard Kevin
Johnson hit two free throws after time expired.
Morrison announced Wednesday that Dowell has been suspended in
definitely from the team. He is not expected to make the trip to Stanford.
The 6-foot-6 junior had been averaging 15.5 points and 7.8 rebounds a
game this year. He scored 13 points last Thursday in the Trojans' 61-59 loss to
Stanford at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
Freshman Hank Gathers is expected to replace Dowell in the Trojans' start
ing lineup.
Pac-10 All-Freshman Team members Tom Lewis and Bo Kimble will have
to take up the slack. Lewis is averaging 17.5 points per game and scored a
game-high 19 against Stanford last week. Kimble is scoring 12.2 points a game
and had nine against the Cardinal.
Stanford won the First meeting when guard John Paye drilled a pair of free
throws with nine seconds remaining to ice the victory. Guard Todd Lichti. an
other Pac-10 All-Freshman Team member, scored 15 points to lead the Card
inal. Center Howard Wright added 13 and guard Novian Whitsitt had 12.
Tomorrow's Stanford-USC game will be broadcast by KCBS (740 AM) and
KZSU (90.1 FM).
