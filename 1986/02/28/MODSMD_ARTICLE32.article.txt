# Card takes on Cats in Six-Pac opener
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — The Univer
sity of Arizona's Sancet Park is a
tough place to play a baseball game
anytime. But to open the season
there, who could ever ask for any
thing tougher?
The Wildcats, 13-6 on the year and
listed as the 10th best team in the
country by the latest ESPN Collegiate
Baseball poll, host Stanford in a
three-game weekend series that
begins today at 2:30 p.m.
The teams will play games two and
three Saturday and Sunday after
noons at 1 p.m.
"Well, we've got to play them
sometime," Cardinal Asst. Coach
Dean Stotz said with a sigh. "Our trip
to Tucson will certainly be a stringent
test." Stanford, the three-time
defending champion of the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Divsion, is cur
rently 11-5 and ranked No., 8 in the
country.

"If you can play them there (in
Tucson) early, it's nice because you
won't have to go hack," Stotz said.
It's unlikely that after the weekend
series Stanford will ever want to
return to Sancet Park. The facility
holds 7,000 — or about 15,000 if you
count the ever-present gila monsters
— and Arizona crowds have a reputa
tion for acting a lot like beasts.
"The fans really get on you down
there," Stotz said. "We've got a
young team, and they hear more than
the veterans do. We can't let it dis
tract us."
It is not only the partisan crowd
that will make the Cardinal feel un
welcome. The team that plays there,
the Wildcats, know very well how to
ruin a good vacation.
"If we can win two of three games,
it would be super." Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "I wouldn't
even go if you told me I could have
that.


In this weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division opener in
Tucson, Arizona and its intimidating home crowd will be trying to
make Stanford bite the dust. But if cleanup hitter John Ramos and the

Mike Topolovac/Daily file
Cardinal offense can take advantage of the suspect Wildcat pitching,
Stanford may slide in among the leaders in the early Six-Pac standings.
The series begins today at 2:30 p.m.
"We expect some real tough
games. They're probably the favorites
to win the conference."
The strength of the Arizona team is
its hitting. The Wildcats, who have
scored 184 runs this year to their op
ponents' 95, enter the series with a
team batting average of .328.
Todd "Sluggo" Trafton is the core
of the attack. The All Six-Pac first
baseman hit .369 last year with 10
home runs and 74 RBIs. Through 19
games this year, Trafton is hitting
.413 with six homers, 12 doubles and
24 RBIs. Marquess calls him "a great
power hitter who can carry a team."
Besides Trafton, Arizona features

third baseman Chip Hale (.328, 2
HRs, 11 RBIs) and leftfielder Mike
Senne (.319, 1 HR, 21 RBIs).
Stanford's Jack McDowell, 4-1 on
the year with a 2.06 ERA, will face
Arizona's lineup today. Righthander
David Carley, 2-0 with a 3.86 ERA,
will start for Jerry Kindall's ballclub.
Marquess has decided to go with
three righthanders this weekend
against the predominantly right
hitting Wildcats. Rob Wassenaar, 2-0
with a 6.61 ERA, will get his first
start in almost three weeks tomorrow.
Gilbert Hereida, 3-1 and 3.21, will
pitch for Arizona.
Stanford's Steve Chitren, a fresh
man who is 2-1 with a 2.53 ERA, and
Arizona's Mike Young, 0-1, will start
Sunday's finale.
