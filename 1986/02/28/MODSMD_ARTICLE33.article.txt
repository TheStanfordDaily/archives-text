# NCAA champions in action
## Ten national titlists at DeGuerre as Card hosts Bears 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
If you want to witness some prime
Stanford athletes sweating out one
of their most trying competitions
this weekend, and you don't want to
sacrifice prime sunbathing time,
DeGuerre Pool is the place to be to
morrow at I p.m.
Along with the predicted sun
shine, spectators will be able to
catch possibly the hottest dual meet
of the 1986 swim season. The Stan
ford men's swim team hosts rival
California at DeGuerre, and both
teams anticipate a grueling battle.
NCAA champions will swim in 10
of tomorrow's 12 events. "This
could be the most quality dual meet
ever," Stanford Coach Skip Kenney
said.
The Bears boast a world-record
holder in the 100 freestyle, Matt
Biondi, and they're the dark-horse
bet to win the NCAAs in April. Cal
swims mean 400, 200 and medley
relays, and it is favored to dominate
these races at the championships.
"Our most important goal this
weekend," Kenney said, "is to swim
well and build momentum for the
end of the season."
The order of events for this meet
is geared toward helping swimmers
prepare for the NCAAs. Instead of
beginning the meet with the 400
relay, the sprinters will have the op
portunity to swim individual 100
yard races for each of the different
strokes. From these separate
results, the coaches will compose a

final 400 relay time. The reason is
to allow the swimmers to post
NCAA qualifying standards.
As for individual performance
goals, Kenney explained that "it's
really tricky to predict this time of
the year exactly how we'll do. We're

in transition between intense quality
workouts and resting periods."
Fortunately, Cal is in the same
situation. "Everyone is healthy ex
cept for Matt Nance, who is 70 to 80
percent recovered from a bout with
mono," Kenney said.

Because this is the last dual meet
of the 1986 season, Kenney said,
"We're dedicating it to the seniors."
If the Cardinal beats the Bears to
morrow, the present seniors will
have gone undefeated for four years
and 45 consecutive meets.
