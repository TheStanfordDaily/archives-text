## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Coming into the Pacific West Championships at East Los Angeles College,
the Stanford women's swimming team was expected to dominate.
Yesterday, in the first day of the three-day event, the Cardinal did just that,
winning six out of seven races. It finished day one with 333 points, with a com
manding 100-point lead over second-place UCLA.
Leading the way for the Cardinal was freshman Jenna Johnson. She won
both the 50-yard freestyle and 100 butterfly events. In the 50 freestyle,
Johnson finished in 23.09, her best time of the year and a meet record.
Senior Lisa Hazen also excelled yesterday, winning the 500 freestyle in an
NCAA qualifying time of 4:48.53. It was her fastest time this year.
Stanford came out on top in both the 200 backstroke and 200 individual
medley events. In the 200 backstroke, freshman Michelle Donahue took first
in a fast 2:01.64 time. Senior co-captain Kathy Smith won the 200 individual
medley, finishing in her best time of the year, 2:03.68.
In the relay events, the Cardinal was forced to settle for a split, winning the
200 medley relay (1:45.84) and coming in second to Arizona in the 800
freestyle relay (1:28.28).
The final two days of the Pac-West Championships continue today and to
morrow.
