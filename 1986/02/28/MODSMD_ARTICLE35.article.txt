# Backup gymnasts to get their chance vs. Davis
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
In last weekend's Hobee's Invitational, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team dominated a thrilling competi
tion with the nation's best score of the season, 281.5
points.
This score was more than three points higher than
the team's previous best, but the Cardinal gymnasts
have a ways to go before they can say they've done the
best they can.
"We have a lot of room to improve," Stanford
Coach Sadao Hamada said after the meet.
The night included few Cardinal misses, the top five
individual all-around scores by a Stanford gymnast this
season, and a frenzied crowd whose jaws dropped
more than a couple times. Yet sophomore Mike Mat
zek could still say, "We didn't have the best meet of
our life."
The meet did give the Cardinal eight some confi
dence about what lies ahead. "We were trying to get
over this barrier of 280, and now we've done it, and it
should be smooth sailing from here," Matzek said. "I
think we'll break all the barriers (we set for our-

As Matzek looks at it, before last weekend the Card
inal needed to make a big step up. Now the men can set
goals which are just tenths of a point ahead of where
they stand.
According to Hamada, Stanford can reach these
goals by improving its showmanship with a little fine
tuning. He feels that his gymnasts need to add a little
flourish to their routines so that they really stand out to
the judges.
Tonight at UC-Davis, the Cardinal will be entering
some different people into the all-around, while its
usual leaders will be taking a low profile.
Doing all six events will be senior Gary Smith, junior
Mark Arnold, and freshmen Andy Ropp and Scott
Schaffer. Smith has gone all-around in the past,
recording a high of 55.2 at the Invitational. It will be
co-captain Arnold's first all-around since he first suf
fered the shoulder injury which has been hindering him
in recent competitions.
The current NCAA rankings have Stanford second
to Arizona State, which will be coming into Maples
next Friday. Davis, which has one of the nation's top
Division II programs, finished last in last weekend's
six-team meet with a score of 246.5.
