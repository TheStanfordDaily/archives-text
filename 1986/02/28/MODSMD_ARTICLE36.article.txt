# Goldie falls to Noah
## Netters looking forward to doubles in La Jolla 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
For almost a century, tennis duos
from up and down the West Coast
have migrated south to frolick in the
sun, enjoy the beaches and play a
couple matches.
Three doubles teams from Stanford
have joined that herd this year and
will play today in the first round of
the 97th annual Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships at the La
Jolla Beach and Tennis Club in La
Jolla.
That's Beach and Tennis, not Ten
nis and Beach. And Stanford Coach
Dick Gould's first comments on the
tournament were not on the competi
tion.
"Have you ever been to La Jolla?
Oh, what a great place to play,"
Gould said on Tuesday. "It's a lot of
fun to play there.
"It's just doubles for three days, so

it's a great break from the blood and
guts of singles," Gould said.
The quality of the competition
should be pretty good, too. The Stan
ford team of Dan Goldie and Jim
Grabb is seeded second, while the
Cardinal pair of John Letts and
Patrick McEnroe is seeded seventh.
The No. 1 seeds are Rick Leach
and Tim Pawsat of USC. That duo
has won the tournament two out of
the last three years.
The field also includes Pep
perdine's Kelly Jones and Dan Sachs,
seeded fourth, and Steve Devries and
Chris Schoop, California's No. 1
doubles team.
Because the tournament is an open
one, high school teams, professionals
and even players who have no affilia
tions whatsoever are eligible to enter.
McEnroe and Letts will play one of
those mystery doubles teams today in
the first round. The Stanford duo will
face Jim Martin of Cardiss and

Robert Kellogg of Encinitas at 11:30
a.m.
Goldie and Grabb have a first
round bye. The third Stanford team
of Eric Rosenfeld and Scott Moody
will play Antonio Ramos and Angel
Lopez, who are both from San Diego.
Second-round play begins at 3:30
p.m. today. The tournament contin
ues through Sunday.
Card notes
Goldie just finished playing in the
Pilot-Penn Classic in La Quinta yes
terday. The Cardinal senior defeated
Jonathan Canter in the second round
on Wednesday 4-6, 6-4, 6-1. Goldie
then lost to fourth seed Yannick
Noah yesterday in the third round, 6-
3,7-6(7-5).
Stanford's final home match of the
winter is Tuesday afternoon. The
Cardinal will host the San Jose Spar
tans at 1:30 p.m.
