### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Tonight at 8 in Maples Pavilion, four of the best
women's gymnastics teams from three states clash,
as Stanford, Georgia, Michigan and California fight
for the crown at the first annual Hobee's Invita
tional.
"It's going to be a really great meet, action
packed on every event," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina said.
The competition should be exceptional.
"Georgia is obviously the favorite," Sardina said.
"They are second in the nation, with an average
score of 185."
Georgia also boasts one of the top all-around
gymnast in the country, Terri Eckert, whose top
'•'•ore is 37.80.

California has one of the top all-around
performers as well, Karin Iyemura, whose average
meet score is approximately 38.0.
"Berkeley is doing quite well," Sardina said.
"They are very good and very young." The Bears
presently have a 180 team average, and are ranked
13th nationally.
Rounding out the list of Cardinal opponents is
Michigan, with a 179 average. Michigan gymnasts
to watch are Angela Williams and Heidi Cohen,
who will both go all-around, according to Michigan
Coach Dana Kempthorn. "Stanford and Georgia
are tough," she said, "but we're looking to keep
performing consistently well."
Despite the tough competition, Sardina has high
hopes for the meet. "It would be nice if we could
reach 183," he said. "We have the capability, but
we must hit 20 routines out of the 24 we do."

Currently, the team's average score is 179.
However, Sardina is confident. "One-hundred
eighty-three — we want it, we can do it, we'll get
it,"he said.
Sardina is equally optimistic about freshman
Jinny Rhee. "I think Jinny can go near 38 in the all
around and break the school record of 37.55," he
said. Her high score to date is 37.05.
He also praised another of the Cardinal fresh
men, Laurence George. "She is continually
impressing us on the balance beam," he said.
Sardina also noted that the team is the healthiest
it has been in weeks. Previously, sophomore Alison
McGann had been ill, and Rhee and Cheryl Doo
have also just recovered from the flu.
The competition will start at 8 p.m., rather than
the scheduled 7:30 time, to allow adequate time for
setting up the equipment and team warm-ups.
