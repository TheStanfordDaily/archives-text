# Injury-plagued women play ASU
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
With just three games left on the
schedule, you'd think that the Stan
ford women's basketball team would
be immune, at last, from the merciless
rash of injuries that has plagued it this
season.
Nothing doing.
Last Saturday against UCLA,
Evon Asforis, Stanford's leading
rebounder, aggravated the knee she
sprained two weeks ago. She will
have to undergo arthroscopic surgery
to determine whether her knee has
sustained any cartilage damage.

This week the Cardinal's other
freshman phenom, Jill Yanke, has
been unable to practice due to a
bruised back. Yanke, Stanford's
leading scorer at 12.9 points a game,
is listed as questionable for tomor
row's game against Arizona State.
"Both Jill and Evon have played a
lot as freshmen this year," Stanford
Coach Tara VanDerveer said. "It's
been a long season for them and
everyone else, and it's taking a toll."
"Long" is a fitting adjective for this
year's edition of women's hoops.
Aside from the long list of injuries,
the Cardinal has had a long winning
streak this season. And currently,

Stanford is suffering from an un
bearably long nine-game losing skid.
"At this point in the season, it's
easy to go through the motions be
cause we're really not going
anywhere," VanDerveer said. "But
people are still putting in the time and
working very hard in practice. People
like Leslie (Lorimer, a 5-foot-10
reserve guard) are staying after
practice in order to work on some
things."
Due to the bandaged Cardinal
lineup and the overall fatigue of many
of the starters, VanDerveer hopes to
play a few of the reserves who "are
still looking very excited about
playing."

Reserves like Lorimer, Jeanne Os
mera and Andrea Ransom may see
more playing time tomorrow night at
Maples Pavilion as Stanford faces the
13-9 Sun Devils.
When the two teams met earlier
this year in Tempe, ASU jumped out
to an early lead and eventually won,
70-58.
VanDerveer expects a much closer
game this time around.
"We can win if we play well and
work hard," she said. "We're 12-to
-14 points better at home than on the
road."
If so, the current losing streak
shouldn't last for long.
