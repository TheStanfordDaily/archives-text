### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
Jed Smock is a man with a mis
sion, or at least an entertaining
show.
Smock, a former U.S. history
professor at the University of Wis-

* ""«■
consin, spends most of his after
noons as ringleader in a kind of
evangelical circus, traveling to col
lege campuses across the country,
preaching his peculiar brand of
Christianity.
And this week, his traveling

circus of sorts set up its tent in
White Plaza.
"I do what I do for the glory of
God and to serve my fellow man,"
Smock claimed. At the same time,
he admitted that he uses "a lot of
antics to gain and hold people's at
tention."
Smock is affiliated with a group
called Campus Ministries U.S.A.,
which sends teams of preachers to
campuses across the countiy. The
organization's goal, according to
Smock, is to "lead people toward
God, love and Jesus Christ."

Smock himself has visited more than
500 campuses in every state except
Alaska, he said.
Smock and his fellow preachers —
his wife, Sister Cindy, and Sister Pat
— arrived on the Farm about a week
ago and have spent the last few after
noons holding forth in front of the
Claw. Smock, who visits mainly state
run universities, said that he doesn't
see much of a difference between stu
dents at Stanford and those else
where.
Stanford students are "pretty typi
cal," he claimed. "Basically, they're
immature, heady, high-minded and
anti-intellectual. They're only here to
party."
However, Smock's partner was not
as harsh, and said that students here
are not as bad as most she has en
countered. "Stanford students' atten
tion span is longer," Sister Pat com
mented. "And they're not as per
verted. On the whole, they're more
mature'."
Smock did mention that he finite
Stanford students "more cultured"
than many of the students he meets.
He theorized that Stanford's tough
admissions requirements and high
cost contribute to the "cultured" at
mosphere here.
Brother Jed, as he is known in
preaching circles, first "saw the light
of Jesus" at a Doobie Brothers con
cert in Terre Haute, Ind., in the early
'70s. He started taking his show on
the road to campuses in about 1974,
he said.
Most college students "are com
pletely ignorant of the Bible and the
ology in general," he said. "I took an

informal poll right out here (in White
Plaza) and only about 10 percent of
these students had read the New
Testament," he noted.
Smock acknowledged that his
message isn't always welcomed. "Just
yesterday, someone spit on me," he
said. Once, at the University of Wis
consin at Madison, he was physically
attacked and was on crutches for two
months as a result, he said.
"I challenge (college students), and
they can't defend their own reason
ing," he claimed. "So they mock and

ridicule me. Just about everything
these students believe, I'm in the op
posite corner," he said.
He said he believes that students
are more disturbed by "what I say
than the way I say it." However, he
said he realizes that his style is flam
boyant and controversial.
'You gotta be a little entertaining,
or people won't pay any attention,"
he commented.
But Brother Jed admitted that his
flashy style turns off a lot of people,
including Dean Hammerton-Kelly

and other religious leaders on
campus. He hasn't met with any
campus ministers, and said, "I prob
ably come on a little too strong for
them."
Yesterday was Brother Jed & Co.'s
last day on the Farm. Today, he and
his colleagues travel across the Bay,
where they will preach at UC-
Berkeley. Brother Jed is looking for
ward to it.
"Most college students aren't as
turned off by my message as they let
on," he claimed.
