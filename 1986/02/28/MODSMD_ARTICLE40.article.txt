### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
Need a little excitement this weekend? Looking for drama and high
paced action?
No, don't turn on the old James Bond reruns — go see the men s fen
cing teams cross swords with six of the top regional contenders.
Tomorrow and Sunday, Foothill College will be the site of this battle,
as the Cardinal meets Fullerton State, the University of San Francisco,
Long Beach State, the University of San Diego, UC-Santa Cruz and Air
Force in the Men's Western Regional Championships.
"There isn't any question that Stanford will go in as the favorite,
Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst said. "We've already beaten Air Force and
Fullerton in individual meets this season. But we have nothing to be
complacent about: we're the people to shoot at now.'"
The real sparks will fly between the Cardinal and Air Force, four-year
Western Regional rivals. "Basically, it should be a contest between Air
Force and Stanford," Hurst said. "We've beaten them three out of four
years during the regular season, but we have never beaten them head to
head at the Westerns."
Unfortunately, this tournament marks the final appearance of Elliott
Cheu and Andy Goorno, who have been the mainstays of the men's fen
cing teams. Foil captain Cheu leaves the team with a career record of
142 victories and 17 defeats. Goorno, sabre captain, Finishes with a four
year mark of 132 wins and 20 losses.
"The bittersweet thing for me about these particular Westerns is the
closing out of two remarkable careers at Stanford," Hurst said. "What is
incredible about their records is that neither one of them recieved any
sort of scholarship aid whatsoever.
"Andy and Elliott have been the backbone of the Stanford men's fen
cing teams for four years now," Hurst added. "1 hope that this will be
their championship."
