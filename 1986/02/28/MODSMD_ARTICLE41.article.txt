# Track opens outdoor season in San Jose
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
For the most part, track meets and sub
marines have little in common, but if you ask
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson about tomor
row's San Jose State Relays, he just might tell
you about submarines.
Because tomorrow's meet is the first of the
Cardinal's outdoor season, Johnson is mainly
interested in seeing how far the team has
progressed. Practice is helpful, but it takes com
petition to see where a team really is.
"It's a chance to assess where we are,"
Johnson said. "It's kind of like being in a sub
marine. Every once in a while you have to put
up your periscope to see where you are.
"We're putting up our periscope."
While most of the team will be performing in
San Jose, the squad won't be quite complete.
Brian Marshall and Lisa Bernhagen, Stanford's
top high jumpers, will be going to Arizona to
compete indoors.
The reason for their trip is to qualify Marshall
for the NCAA Indoor Championships on

March 15, and to give Bernhagen, who has
qualified already, more indoor experience.
The NCAA qualfying standard for the indoor
men's high jump is 7-feet 3'/i-inches, a mark
which high jump coach Dave Wollman is confi
dent that Marshall will reach. "If he doesn't I'll
kill him," Wollman said.
Marshall jumped 7-3 l /i last year, but he has
been plagued by nagging shin splints and has
only been able to reach 7-2 1/4 this year.
But fortunately for the Cardinal, shin splints
don't last forever. Recently, Marshall's shin
problems have subsided.
"He has the potential to win the NCA As, but
he has to qualify first," Wollman said. His
chance will come tomorrow.
Back in San Jose, Stanford athletes to watch
will include shot-putters Pam Dukes and Patty
Purper, who both have qualified for the NCAA
indoors, and Brian Connoly, Jeff Atkinson,
Christian Skoog and Steve Schadler, who will
run the distance medley and the 4xBoo-meter
relay. Two weeks ago, Atkinson, Skoog and
Connoly teamed up with Brian Pettingill to set a
new school record in the indoor 4xBoom.
