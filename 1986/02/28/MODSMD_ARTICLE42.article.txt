# Sailors head south

### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
It is safe to say that the Stanford sailing
team has no competition in Northern Cali
fornia. Southern California, on the other
hand, poses quite a challenge. The sailing
team will travel to Southern California this
weekend to meet this competition in the
South Series 3 & 4 regatta to be held in
Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal will take four boats on the
road, including one representing the "newly
revitalized" women's team. The main com
petition this weekend, as it has been all year,
will be UC-Irvine and USC. Both teams are
ranked above Stanford despite the Card
inal's back-to-back victories over the An
teaters in the last two regattas.
"All the good teams are going to be
there," team member Dan Buckstaff said.
"The South is where the real competition is.
It would be nice to beat them."
Stanford is approaching this regatta as if it
were one of the more important qualifier
events. This involves concentrating on one
Hoat and having it place well, as opposed to

evening out the teams and having the team
do well as a whole.
"We ll be rotating people. As the wind in
creases, we'll put in different people," Coach
Joe Petrucci said. "I am going to freely can
nibalize combinations."
The Stanford women's team will be send
ing down a strong contingent that has
recently come together as a team. Consisting
of a group of seasoned sailors, the women's
team, previously unranked, is now ranked
15th in the nation and is looking to move up
this weekend.
"Our women's team has really not come
together as much as we would've liked until
now," Petrucci said. "But the team is really
going to appear on the scene. It is stronger
than ever. I predict we're going to come out
of nowhere and slide into the top 10."
Though the team is approaching it as an
important regatta, this weekend's competi
tion is still just a warm-up for competition in
the spring, which includes the team's road
trip east at the end of March.
"Our ultimate goal is to peak at the
qualifiers," Petrucci said. "We're trying not
to burn our people out now."
