Aquino releases political prisoners
MANILA, Philippines — Under orders from President Corazon
Aquino, the Philippine armed forces began releasing political prisoners
yesterday, in what was seen as an early indicator of whether she will be
able to exercise her authority over the military leaders who helped her
overthrow former President Ferdinand Marcos.
Aquino also met with U.S. presidential envoy Philip Habib, who
arrived yesterday morning "to assess the situation . . . and to express
support for the Aquino administration," a U.S. Embassy spokesman
said.
The government television said Habib told Aquino the Filipinos had
"astonished the world with their courage" in ousting Marcos without
violence.
Diplomatic analysts and Filipino observers agreed that Aquino's mili
tary leadership, which is concerned about the prospective release of
Communist militants who support an insurgency, were pressuring her to
back away from her campaign pledge to release all political prisoners as
soon as possible.
Yesterday morning, Aquino ordered the release of 39 prisoners, in
cluding labor activists and lawyers, some of whom had been imprisoned
for more than six years. But Aquino's militaiy chief of staff announced
pointedly that the group included no one who had taken up arms against
the government.
Danes to stay in Common Market
COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Danes voted yesterday to endorse
changes in the Common Market previously rejected by their Parliament,
thus keeping Denmark a full member of the 12-nation organization.
About 75 percent of Denmark's 4 million voters took part in a na
tional referendum on a series of changes in the 1957 Treaty of Rome,
the constitution of the Common Market. The changes were rejected six
weeks ago by the Danish Parliament, but 56 percent of the people voting
yesterday chose to support them.
The vote was a political victory for Conservative Prime Minister Poul
Schlueter and the four-party coalition government he has headed since
1982.
For the opposition Social Democrats and former Prime Minister
Anker Jorgensen, the vote was a severe setback. Jorgensen had taken
the lead in the Parliament's rejection of the treaty changes.
The referendum is expected to eliminate the Common Market as a po
litical issue in Denmark. Danish membership has been a matter of con
tention since the nation voted to join in 1972.
Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen will fly to The Hague Friday
to add Denmark's approval to the treaty amendments, which are known
as the European Act. Nine other members approved the act at a cere
mony 10 days ago in Luxembourg. Italy and Greece have held back,
waiting to see what Denmark would do.
There is now no doubt that the treaty changes, the first since it came
into force, will be ratified, a process involving all the member parlia
ments. The changes are aimed at increasing the unity and efficiency of
the European Communities, and speeding development, by 1992, of a
truly open Common Market, free of all trade barriers and restraints.
Case dropped in pope shooting
ROME — The prosecutor here yesterday asked that the case against
three Bulgarians accused in connection with the attempted assassination
of Pope John Paul II be dropped.
Antonio Marini said that there was insufficient evidence to support a
case against the three, two of whom were being tried in absentia.
In seeking the acquittal of the three Bulgarians, the prosecutor said
that he was still upholding his plea for punishment of three Turks
accused in the conspiracy to kill the pontiff on May 13, 1981.
He said that there were major indications of a conspiracy between the
Bulgarian defendants and the Turkish right-wing extremist Grey Wolves
group.
But, Marini said, much of the evidence was based on confessions by
the Turk Mehmet Ali Agca who fired at and wounded the pope. Agca is
already serving a life sentence for the attack and although appearing as a
defendant in the trial was the chief prosecution witness.
The prosecutor said much of Agca's evidence about the Bulgarian
connection was contradictory, and although there was some independent
corroboration, it was not enough for a successful prosecution.
Iran, Iraq fighting on three fronts
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq said yesterday that its armed forces were
slaughtering Iranian revolutionary guard brigades streaming across its
borders on two fronts, while Iran reported new territorial gains in north
ern mountainous areas leading to Iraq's oil-rich province of Kirkuk.
Iraq conceded publicly for the first time Iran's three-day-old invasion
of the northern Sulaimaniya area, where it said its forces were inflicting
heavy casualties on the Iranians. /
But it said the Iranian drive across snow-covered mountains was es
sentially an attempt to relieve pressure on another invasion force lodged
in the Faw peninsula, about 550 miles south of Sulaimaniya.
Iraq reported its forces had "wiped out and removed" nine revolu
tionary guard brigades since the Iranians crossed the disputed Shatt al
Arab waterway on Feb. 10 and occupied Faw.
Iran said that it had taken more than 21 more strategic mountain
peaks in the Sulaimaniya area, occupying about 150 square miles of stra
tegic territories in a determined bid to topple the Baghdad government.
Looters target Duvalier associates
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Looters yesterday tried to ransack
properties held by suspected associates of the ousted dictator Jean-
Claude Duvalier, but soldiers sent to patrol the downtown commercial
district intercepted the crowds before they could break into any stores.
In the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince, occasional gunshots broke the
faint rustle of afternoon breezes. In some cases, neighborhoods previ
ously untouched by such activity became the scene of taunting mobs
seeking revenge against members of the Ton-Ton Macoutes, Duvalier's
personal militia.
Although it was the second consecutive day of scattered unrest in the
capital, most of the city functioned normally. Several stores closed in a
four-block district downtown, but even there, street vendors carried on
as usual on crowded sidewalks.
The outbreaks suggest, however, that the lingering presence of
Duvalier agents and associates is much resented. In addition, attacks on
less well-known businessmen linked to Duvalier may foreshadow wider
turbulence, foreign observers said.
