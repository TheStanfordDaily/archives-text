# Army crushes police mutiny
## 
### 
CAIRO, Egyptâ€” Army tanks and
troops yesterday captured a base oc
cupied by mutinous security forces
near the Pyramids, as the death toll
climbed to 36 in three days of fighting
in the Egyptian capital, government
officials said.
With mopping-up operations
nearly completed around the
Pyramids, the officials said the revolt
by several thousand members of the
paramilitary Central Security Forces
had been crushed.
Osama Baz, President Hosni
Mubarak's chief political adviser, told
reporters that 36 people had been
killed and 321 injured in the clashes
that erupted near the Pyramids Tues
day night and spread throughout the
capital and to three provincial cities
before the army could restore con
trol.
Egypt's prosecutor-general,
Mohammed Guindi, said that 2,000
members of the security forces and
700 civilian rioters had been arrested.
In what appeared to be the govern
ment's first admission that reasons for
the clashes go beyond a simple
dispute over conscription, Baz said
authorities were looking "very
seriously into the causes and underly
ing causes" of the worst rioting here
in nine years.
However, he maintained that the
clashes were an "isolated episode. . .

not a mass uprising," and said that
the four-year-old Mubarak govern
ment remained "very safe, secure and
solid.'RPA '
Privately, a number of diplomats
and political analysts questioned this
assessment. They noted that the vio

lence triggered by a mutiny at a se
curity forces base very quickly fused
with economic, political and religious
grievances that brought mobs of
rioting civilians into the streets.
Some of the rioting had Islamic
fundamentalist overtones. In some

cases, roving bands of club-wielding
youths looted shops and attacked cars
in wealthy areas of the city, while in
others bands of men chanting "God
Is Great" broke into nightclubs and
discotheques and destroyed their
stocks of liquor before setting fire to
them, according to witnesses.
Following a night of intermittent
clashes and scattered rioting, order
throughout the capital appeared to
have been restored by yesterday af
ternoon with a final army assault on
the security forces base in Giza where
the mutiny began two days earlier.
According to the government, the
disturbances, the worst since food
riots claimed scores of lives in 1977,
were triggered when a false rumor
that their terms of conscription were
being extended a year circulated
through the security forces.
The rioting quickly took on social
and religious overtones, however, as
disaffected groups of'civilians joined
in, attacking cars and buses in the
capital and burning a score of
nightclubs along the road to the
Pyramids Wednesday night after the
curfew had been imposed.
Although it was plainly evident
that the unrest had spread from the
police to the civilian sector, the gov
ernment was reluctant to admit that
anyone but "deviationist" members
of the security forces were involved.
