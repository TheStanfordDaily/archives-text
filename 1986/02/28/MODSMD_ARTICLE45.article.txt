# Panel head lashes out at NASA

### 
WASHINGTON — After three full days of tes
timony about unheeded flight safety warnings, the
presidential commission investigating the Chal
lenger disaster concluded yesterday that the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration's
procedure for deciding whether to launch the
spacecraft was "clearly flawed."
Commission chairman William Rogers stopped
short of blaming NASA's decision-making system
for the Challenger explosion, but he instructed top
space agency officials to correct what he described
as a tangled bureaucratic process that serves to
"eliminate the elements of judgment and good
sense."
"I believe I am speaking for the whole commis
sion when I say that it is flawed," the former secre
tary of state told four high-ranking shuttle officials.
"The process as it worked in this case was clearly
flawed because recommendations made were not
fully understood by you or conveyed to you."
Rogers' blunt declaration came toward the con
clusion of a hearing in which representatives of
Rockwell International testified that they, like en
gineers for the company that built the Challenger's
booster rockets, had tried to caution NASA that
cold weather posed dangerous unknowns for the
delicate spacecraft. Rockwell manufactured the
Challenger.

Rogers said that the commission, in the 24th day
of its 120-day assignment to pinpoint cause and
recommend corrections to President Reagan, had
concluded its exploration of the decision-making
process that allowed the Challenger to be cleared
for flight.
He said no additional public hearings would be
held for at least a week. A commission official said
that the members would now divide into smaller
groups, "roll up their sleeves" and pursue specific
trails leading toward an exact technical cause of the
accident.
The key piece of evidence most likely is resting
beneath 1,000 feet of ocean waters off Cape
Canaveral, where sonar readings indicate the sea
floor is littered with what are believed to be shat
tered remnants of the Challengers right-hand
booster rocket.
The prevailing theory is that a joint in the
booster began leaking propellant on liftoff. About
a minute into flight, as the spacecraft bucked heavy
wind shears and dynamic aeronautic forces at the
edge of space, the rupture at the joint widened,
directing a deadly plume of hot gas against the
spacecraft's huge external fuel tank.
Much of the public testimony before the commis
sion this week centered on a recommendation by

engineers for Morton Thiokol, the company that
builds the boosters, to suspend the launch because
of forecasts of sub-freezing temperatures at the
time of liftoff. They feared that the O-rings would
not work properly in the cold.
Questioning yesterday was devoted largely to de
termining why the top level of launch decision
makers were unaware of both the Morton Thiokol
warning and concerns expressed hours before
launch by Rockwell representatives, who feared
launch-pad ice might damage the spacecraft's vital
system of thermal protection tiles.
William Lucas, the head of the NASA's propul
sion center, said the "reporting chain" did not re
quire him to tell the inner circle of launch officials
about Morton Thiokol's concerns, even though, as
Rogers put it, "you had ample opportunity to pass
along the information that there had been serious
concern about this seal."
Rocco Petrone, president of space transportation
systems at Rockwell, testified that he had discussed
the ice conditions with his managers at the cape by
telephone from his Downey, Calif., office in the
predawn hours before launch. Petrone said he told
his managers at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida: "Let's make sure that they at NASA un
derstand that we at Rockwell feel it is not safe to
launch."
