Bennett on black English
WASHINGTON — Education Secretary
William Bennett said yesterday that he favors
using black English as a teaching tool.
"I'm not from the huffy-puffy school," Ben
nett said in an interview. "1 think you should use
anything that's not illegal or immoral to get stu
dents to learn."
As an example, he said, "If one can use black
English to give students an appreciation of
literature and proper English usage . . . fine. 1
don't care. It's just like anything else."
Although some linguists say black English is a
legitimate language with its own syntax, vocabu
lary and rhythm, many educators contend it is
slang whose use in classrooms handicaps stu
dents.
Military may cut troops
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department
will be forced to trim 330,000 troops from the
armed services unless Congress retreats from an

order to reduce the military payroll. Pentagon of
ficials warned yesterday.
Faced with a congressionally imposed May 1
deadline to trim $2.9 billion from the Pentagon
budget account devoted to pay for active duty
troops, reserves and retirees, the Defense De
partment has submitted two plans that would
shave the retirement benefits given to future vol
unteers.
But it has said it approves neither proposal and
is instead suggesting that it would have to fire
troops on active and reserve duty. There are at
present 2.1 million active-duty troops and an
other 850,000 on reserve.
TV, radio to air Senate
WASHINGTON — The Senate, nervously
and belatedly edging its way into the television
era, voted yesterday to allow trial television and
radio coverage of its proceedings.
Under the painstakingly drafted resolution —
passed 67 to 21 — radio coverage of the Senate

will begin almost immediately, with live televi
sion broadcasts following on June 1. In late July,
the Senate will evaluate the experiment and
decide whether to allow cameras and
microphones to become permanent fixtures in
the Senate chamber.
The test would be accompanied by a series of
new Senate rules aimed at limiting senators' abil
ity to dominate days of televised proceedings
with filibusters. Nonetheless, opponents warned
that the television cameras could provide an op
portunity for endless grandstanding in an already
inefficient Senate.

ful advance that carried the Dow Jones industrial
