Protest plans revealed
SAN FRANCISCO — Animal rights activists
announced plans yesterday for civil disobedience
at animal research labs in California and three
other areas, unless their representatives are
allowed inside to photograph and record lab
operations.
Various animal rights organizations have
banded together as the "April 24th Coalition" to
push for an end to what they contend are un
necessary and immoral abuses of research
animals. The actions planned for April 24 are
likely to lead to hundreds of arrests, spokesmen
said.
The protests are planned at UC-Berkeley, UC-
San Francisco, UC-Davis, Stanford, UCLA, UC-
Irvine, University of Pennsylvania and in Wash
ington D.C. and New York, said spokesmen for
the group.
"Feeling, sensitive animals are subjected to
horrors beyond belief," said veterinarian Elliot
Katz, founder and president of the In Defense of
Animals group.

Letters outlining the April 24 plan and four
demands have been sent to more than 40 univer
sity animal research facilities across the country,
with no response, said Katz.
March is in jeopardy
LOS ANGELES — The eight-month Great
Peace March to Washington D.C. is scheduled to
kick off tomorrow in Los Angeles, but officials
from cities along the route say an inability to get
required insurance coverage may stall the 3,235-
mile march in its tracks.
Without coverage, the California Department
of Transportation and some cities have said they
will not grant parade or other permits for PRO-
Peace, the sponsoring group.
"If they don't get insurance by March I, I am
told by them they will not go," Lt. John Kielbasa
of the California Highway Patrol said yesterday.
The CHP has been contracted to escort the esti
mated 1,200 marchers, whose ranks may swell to

5,000 during the march through 37 cities in 15
states.
Raiders: gone for good?
SAN FRANCISCO — Oakland's hopes of
bringing the Raiders back from Los Angeles
were dimmed yesterday when the state Supreme
Court refused to reinstate the city's suit to buy
the National Football League team.
With one dissenting vote, the court denied a
hearing on Oakland's appeal of a lower-court
ruling that said a city's use of the power of
eminent domain to acquire a National Football
League team would place an unconstitutional
burden on interstate commerce.
Fog, sun are reported
An unnamed source predicts fog today, but
otherwise sunny and mild. Highs in the 70s to low
80s with variable winds. Authorities could not be
reached for comment.
