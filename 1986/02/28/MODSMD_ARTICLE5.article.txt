Eight University scientists and engineers
have been named Presidential Young In
vestigators for 1986, an honor that brings
up to $500,000 in research funds to each
recipient over five years.
The award, given to 100 U.S. scholars
each year, recognizes outstanding poten
tial for research and teaching. It is de
signed to help universities retain talented
scientists who might otherwise pursue non
academic careers.
The recipients are: Mark Cutkosky, me
chanical engineering; Peter Galison, phil
osophy; Stephen Boyd, electrical engi
neering; Alice Gast, chemical engineering;

Brian White, mathematics; Clyde Tatum,
civil engineering; Jonathan Stebbins, geol
ogy; and Paul Frattini, chemical engineer
ing.
Stanford led universities nationwide this
year, with Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, Princeton and the University of
Texas each having six recipients. Since the
program started in 1984, UC-Berkeley
ranks first nationally with 31 recipients.
Stanford is second with 27.
The awards, administered by the Na
tional Science Foundation, provide each
investigator with a $25,000 grant each
year. The foundation will also match up to
$37,500 in funds from private industry,
bringing total possible support to
$100,000 a year for five years.

Cutkosky hopes to design a robotic hand
which will hold tools and manipulate parts.
The hand will be "a much more Sophisti
cated gripper" than is now in use, Cut
kosky said. He will work independently
but will have informal input from a num
ber of Stanford engineering departments.
Assoc. Philosophy Prof. Galison seems
an unlikely candidate for a scientific
award, but his specialty is 20th century
physics. He plans to observe the effects of
large scale projects like the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) on the
study of physics.
Boyd told University News Service that
he began his career as a mathematician,
but once out of school, he did "real nuts
and-bolts engineering." His practical

training came while doing sound produc
tion for rock n' roll bands. Now he hopes
to solve problems in large engineering sys
tems using pure mathematical techniques.
Frattini, a chemical engineer who
recently received his doctorate from Stan
ford, is working in Germany studying iron
oxides in red blood cells. The technique
which he developed at Stanford allows sci
entists to measure the orientation of those
same oxides on computer disks using
polarized light.
The only woman at Stanford to receive
the award, Gast is an assistant professor in
the Chemical Engineering Department.
She is currently working on determining
