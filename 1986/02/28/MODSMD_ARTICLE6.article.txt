# Officers discuss racism in U. S. armed forces
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Although the U.S. military is "the scene
of a bad racial situation," the leaders of the
armed forces do not want to deal with it,
according to Vietnam War veteran Charles
Trujillo.
Trujillo, however, was alone in his
opinion yesterday when he joined four
members of the U.S. armed forces in an El
Centro panel discussion on Latinos in the
military.
El Centro Student Coordinator David
Moguel said the goal of the discussion was
"to get a handle on the situation of Latinos
in the armed forces," focusing on the dif
fering perspectives between members of
the armed forces and Stanford students.
When asked to comment on a positive
aspect on being a Latino in the military.
Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Robert Gelarza

said that "racism hasn't been too bad for
me, because I'm honest. I tell people when
I don't like something."
He added that he has seen minorities
"with their heads down" as a result of rac
ism, but advised students that "if you keep
your heads up, you'll do OK."
Marine Corps Second Lt. Thomas
Perea, who attended law school through
the Marine Reserves' program, said he has
found "nothing but equality and equal op
portunity" in the Marine Corps.
"Everyone in boot camp is green,"
Perea said, adding that members of the
military are rewarded according to the
quality of their work, not the color of their
skin.
Marine Corps Capt. Jose Riviera
agreed, saying, "In the Marine Corps,
there's only one color, and that's green."
He said that "getting the job done is the
way Marine Corps promotions happen."

When asked about institutional racism
in the military, Trujillo claimed that
Chicanos were "doubly represented in
Vietnam casualties," and that minorities
received more dishonorable discharges
during Vietnam than did whites .
Trujillo also cited problems with the Ku
Klux Klan and blacks in the Marine Corps
as examples of racial tension in the mili
tary.
In response to Trujillo's claims, Riviera
said he has "seen very few people, let
alone Latinos, get dishonorable dis
charges" during the six years he has been
in the Marine Corps.
When asked what kinds of procedures
the military has to handle problems or
questions involving racism, Air Force Sgt.
Tony Romero cited the Air Force's Social
Actions Office, where any member of the
Air Force can file complaints of discrimi
nation due to race, religion and sex.

Riviera said that actions are taken
against racial incidents in the Marine
Corps, adding that "the military is on the
lookout for that sort of problem."
When asked whether there may be a
ceiling over Latino attempts to achieve
higher ranks in the military, Riviera said,
"It's hard to make general, since there are
only 52 of them."
Trujillo responded that because nearly
half of U.S. military personnel are
minorities, nearly half of the officers
should be minorities.
When asked about the conflict of inter
est that Latino soldiers might feel when or
dered to fight against Latin Americans,
Perea said, "If someone is pointing a rifle
at you, what is the difference?"
Riviera said that soldiers can become
conscientious objectors, ensuring they
would not have to take part in active com
bat.
