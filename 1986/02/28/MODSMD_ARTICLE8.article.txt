# TAs carry power, pressures

One undergraduate teaching assistant in Computer Sci
ence 105 A last spring ran through program assignments
step-by-step for a friend in the class, in effect writing the
program for her, according to a classmate.
Another undergraduate TA, who asked not to be iden
tified, is aware of the power that he has as a TA but is
unsure if such a position is legitimate.
"I really think that part of the enjoyment that's at least
in thd back of [TAs'] minds is their position of power. It's
being sort of vaunted, thinking, T know more than you
do,' whether you know more than they do or not," he
said.
In determining grades, these undergraduate TAs and
others at Stanford are often responsible for the academic
lifeblood of their friends and fellow classmates.
Undergraduate TAs shoulder many of the responsibili
ties of graduate TAs: grading examinations and papers,
presenting class lectures, holding office hours, leading dis
cussion sections and attending course organizational
meetings.
Sometimes these TAs are under extreme pressure.
Many have little or no teaching experience and most have
less background knowledge than the graduate TAs. A few
teach classes outside of their departmental majors.
Some TAs admit to feeling a conflict of interest in
grading examinations and assignments for students who
are their friends.
"There are times (when I felt a conflict)," said Mark
Sherman, an 1985 graduate who was a TA for a psychol
ogy course and four biology courses. "But when you've
graded 50 papers before you come to one (of your
friend's), you've established what points are given and
you give them the same points that you give everyone
else."
Sometimes, TA favoritism operates in more subtle
ways. In Asst. Prof. Jerry Talley's Sociology 103 class last
spring, for example, one T A accepted a paper late without
penalty from her friend, according to another in the class.
In Prof. Philip Zimbardo's Psychology 1 class, optional
discussion sections are run by four graduate and four un
dergraduate TAs who have the final say on giving the one
unit of pass/no credit. "Phil (Zimbardo) said that every
thing's up to us. I kind of don't like it," said Brooke
Armstrong, a T A for the class last year. She said that if a
student became upset, she was the one who had to deal
with it.

Students sometimes pressure their TA-friends in subtle
ways, according to several TAs and students. Sue
Cameron, a petroleum engineering graduate who worked
as a TA for Prof. A.J. Horn's introductoiy Petroleum En
gineering 103 course last spring said she got "a hard time
from seniors" who were her friends in the class.
Some administrators, professors and students question
the use of undergraduate TAs.
English Prof. Martin Evans, who uses graduate student
TAs in his English 10 class, Masterpieces of English
Literature I, said that he has never considered using un
dergraduates.
"Having undergraduates awarding grades is
problematic," Evans said, pointing out that Stanford stu
dents pay a high price for their education and expect the
"best and brightest (instructors) the University can offer."
The standard salary for TAs who work "half-time" (20
hours per week) ranges from $2,036 to $2,443 per quar
ter, according to the Office of Graduate Studies. Some de
partments pay by the hour. P.E. 103 TAs, for example.,
are paid $6 an hour, one TA said.
Because some undergraduate TAs work for units only
and are not on University personnel lists, the number of
undergraduate TAs employed is difficult to estimate. But
their use by departments is widespread, including the Psy
chology, Sociology, Petroleum Engineering, Human Biol
ogy, Group Communication, Computer Science, Biology
and Chemistry departments. And the number appears to
be on the rise.
Unlike Mathematics Prof. Mary Sunseri, who said she
started using undergraduate TAs last year because stu
dents asked "to be more involved," some professors have
little choice — there are simply not enough graduate stu
dents to do the work.
"The number of graduate students in the (Sociology)
department is very limited," Talley said. "They can give
me maybe one — sometimes not even that.... I can have
one graduate TA and give true/false tests, or I can have
undergraduates and have the students write papers."
Several professors said they enjoy working with under
graduate TAs. Horn, who uses six to eight undergraduates
each quarter for P.E. 103, praised his TAs.
"I like working with undergraduates," he said. "I think
they can learn more and extend their areas of discipline
farther."
University Ombudsperson Leah Kaplan said that the
most common student complaints about TAs regard "the
issue of fairness — that grades are not high enough or low
enough; whether they are biased or not."
