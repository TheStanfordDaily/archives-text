California Lutheran University yesterday divested itself of its stock in com
panies doing business in South Africa, according to the university's president.
Its a judgment on our part that we would no longer go along with the ..
worsening economic conditions in South Africa," Jerry Miller said in an
interview yesterday.
The Jan. 11 decision by the Board of Regents to divest was initiated by a pe
tition of about 500 students calling for total divestment.
California Lutheran University, located in Thousand Oaks, is a private col
lege with an enrollment of 2,350 students.
In the past, CLU, along with many other colleges and universities, had
abided by the Sullivan Principles in monitoring their South Africa investments.
Developed in 1977 by Philadelphia minister Leon Sullivan, the code calls on
companies in South Africa to improve life for blacks. This improvement is to
take place through provisions of equal pay for equal work, desegragated
workplaces, upgraded job conditions and support for an end to apartheid.
At this point in time, the Board of Regents said further steps needed to be
taken beyond the Sullivan guidelines," Miller said.
CLU divested of $50,000 in Chevron Corp. Although this is only 2 percent
of the school s $2.5 million, Miller said the action was significant because it
was a further expression of our moral indignation" at South Africa.
Miller said the unstable economic conditions in South Africa were also a
concern.
In the future, any gifts to the university of stocks in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa would be accepted only under the condition that they
would be sold immediately, Miller added.
Miller said CLU's decision was consistent with positions adopted by the
American Lutheran Church and the Lutheran Church in America, two church
bodies that support the university.
