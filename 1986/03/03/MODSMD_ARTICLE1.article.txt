# Bonner visits campus
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Yelena Bonner, wife of exiled So
viet physicist Andrei Sakharov, paid a
visit to the Stanford campus Friday
where she met with scientists, faculty
members and personal friends who
have supported her efforts to free her
husband.
"It was a bittersweet occasion,"
Prof. Sydney Drell told the Times
Tribune Saturday. "It was sweet to
see Yelena again . . . bu! it was very
sad we couldn't have Andrei, too."
Bonner visited the Stanford Center
tor International Security and Arms
Control (CISAC), and she attended a
lunch at Galvez House where she met
with scientists from the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
members of the Stanford physics de
partment and other friends and col
leagues of her husband.
Bonner was permitted to leave the
Soviet Union last year to undergo eye
and heart surgery after Sakharov
staged hunger strikes on her behalf,
but she received her visa under the
condition that she makes no public
statements while outside of the Soviet
Union.
For that reason, Drell, who is one
of a number of Stanford scientists
seeking Sakharov's release, declined
to quote her directly, but told The
Daily yesterday that she confirmed
public accounts of her husband's suf
fering during his hunger strikes.
Sakharov, inventor of the Soviet
hydrogen bomb and winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, has been
exiled since 1980 in the closed city of
Gorky.
Drell said he "was pleased to see
[Bonner's physicalj progress Her
health was noticeably improved."
Drell also acknowledged that Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
had personally issued an invitation to
Bonner for Sakharov to become a
visiting scholar at Stanford.
"We told her of the continued im
portance which the scientific commu
nity attaches to his (Sakharov's)
work. His work is still appreciated in
the West. It hasn t been forgotten,"
said Drell, who is the deputy director
of SLAC and co-director of of the
CISAC. He added that for the last
few years Stanford scientists have
sent Sakharov lists of references to
his work from all over the world to
prevent his being isolated from his
colleagues.
.According to Wolfgang Panofsky,
director emeritus of SLAC, "She's a
lady with a mission. ... She's trying
to convince the'world of her hus
band's innocence."
Panofsky, who had previously un
dergone similar heart surgery, said he
and Bonner "exchanged notes on the
operation."

"She's doing very well, consider
ing," Panofsky said.
History Prof. Alexander Dallin
said Bonner seemed pessimistic con
cerning prospects for the release of
her husband, adding that he felt Sak
harov's chances for release were "not
good."
But according to one source, who
asked not to be identified, "the extent
to which details of Dr. Bonner's visit
to the Stanford area have already
been 'revealed' to the media is
distressing, given the stipulations,
however regrettable, of a visa that
was only reluctantly granted her by
Soviet authorities. That statements as
potentially sensitive as her husband's
latest research were apparently
leaked to the press suggests a disre
gard of the very real dangers the Sak
harovs must face every day of their
lives."
Drell told the Times Tribune that
Bonner said Sakharov is currently in
terested in "super strings," an aspect
of particle theory which Drell called
"one of the hot new ideas right now."
Bonner's Stanford visit was
revealed last week, two days after a
student/faculty committee had issued
the physicist an open invitation to
speak at Stanford.
