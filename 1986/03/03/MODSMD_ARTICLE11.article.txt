Vietnam. A word that once conjured up images of '
napalm attacks, bloody helicopter raids and handi
capped veterans now is becoming confused with visions
of Rambo and Chuck Norris and Hollywood's new pa
triotism. What was once the greatest controversy in
U.S. history has faded from the younger generation's
minds and been replaced by fictitious stories of victory
and honor.
The Stanford community will have a chance to set
the record straight this week when a mobile, half-scale
replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washing
ton, D.C. visits campus.
Bearing the names of 58,022 U.S. military personnel
either killed or listed as missing in action in the Viet
nam War, the "Moving Wall" should remind the Stan
ford community of the emotional reality and the his
torical importance of the war. Everyone should take
time to visit the wall, constructed yesterday in the field
between Wilbur and Stern halls, where it will remain
through Sunday.
Students should take special notice of the memorial
and the emotional response it will undoubtedly receive
from older visitors. The Vietnam War has had little im
mediate impact on our generation, yet it continues to
be one of the most profound influences on the world in
which we live. The origins of the distrust of the govern
ment, the reluctance to commit military force to

remote parts of the world and the widespread protests
against social injustices that are now integral parts of
the American mindset can be traced back to the period
of the Vietnam War.
It is a well-known fact that many of the soldiers who
fought and died in Vietnam were younger than most
Stanford students. The memorial should cause us to
ask ourselves how prepared we would be to fight in a
war and what we would have done had we been in the
situation of those drafted to fight. It should cause us to
question who the heroes of the war were: those who
courageously answered the call of the government and
fought without questioning its motives, or those who
tore up their draft cards and refused to fight in what
many considered an unjust war?
Perhaps more importantly, the memorial should
cause us to look to the future and examine the role of
war as a reasonable means to address political differ
ences. Seeing the names of 58,022 dead men and
women can only prompt rejection of the idea that war
should be carried out in the name of abstract
ideologies.
Stanford must commend Branner for bringing the
wall to campus, its creators for allowing us to take part
in a unique experience close to home and all Vietnam
veterans for their determination not to let memories of
Vietnam fade away. Go see the memorial and help
keep an important memory alive.
