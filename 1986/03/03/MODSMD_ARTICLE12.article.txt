## Marcos ouster no credit to U.S. 
### 
The Reagan Administrations so-called "dumping" of
the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship is being hailed by both
Congress and the media as a triumph of the Administra
tion's foreign policy. But the best that can be said about
Reagan's celebrated handling of the Philippine crisis is
simply that he averted bungling "this one" by defecting to
the winner's side almost at the very last moment.
The United States pulled the rug out from under
Marcos only when it became obvious that all was lost for
the dictator. In fact, Reagan had to be dragged into finally
abandoning Marcos, and only the State Department's
timely sense of political realism prevented what may have
been a disastrous attempt by Reagan to sustain a widely
discredited tyrant.

ABRACOSA ET AL.

The dubious implication that the United States played a
key role in restoring democracy in the Philippines cannot
disguise the fact that the United States abandoned Marcos
only because it had no choice in the face of overwhelming
odds against the dictator. It is hard for many Filipinos to
believe that the United States acted out of a long-standing
commitment to democracy in the Philippines.
It must not be forgotten that it was American support
that propped up Marcos for 20 years, and that, in fact, it
was Reagan's vacillation — including his earlier sugges
tion that his concern for the American bases in the
Philippines was what mattered most — that emboldened
Marcos to try to force his fraudulent election victory,
believing that he could continue to manipulate the United
States into accommodating him in exchange for the bases.
Reagan s final dumping of Marcos may have prevented a
potential bloodbath in the Philippines, but that does not
automatically absolve the United States from being held
accountable for the suffering and excesses caused by the
erstwhile U.S.-backed dictator.
The liberation of the Filipino people from the tyranny
of the Marcos regime is a tribute to the Filipinos' own ef
forts — not the United States. Unfortunately, the Reagan
Administration appears bent on capitalizing upon the im
pression that the United States brought about the return
of democracy to the Philippines to justify increased U.S.
involvement in the affairs of that country. The remarks of
Ramon Myers, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute
(Daily, Feb. 26), that this is a "golden time for the United
States to exercise a modernizing influence" in the
Philippines reflects a fundamental U.S. attitude of pater
nalism and self-righteous intervention in Philippine af
fairs.
U.S. involvement in Philippine affairs may not, in itself,
be undesirable if it were done out of genuine concern to
help that country build democratic institutions. But the
record of U.S. involvement in the Philippines belies these
noble concerns. It is U.S. self-interest that has always

dictated the nature of U.S. intervention in the Philippines,
and it has always been from a position of dominance that
U.S. involvement is carried out in the Philippines.
The United States undoubtedly is in a strong position to
intervene in Philippine political, economic and military af
fairs. But such intervention can be destabilizing to the
present government in the Philippines.
The Corazon Aquino government is a coalition of left
liberals, moderates and right-wing elements. Because of
that, it is especially vulnerable to destablizing forces that
might encourgage factionalism after the current
honeymoon stage of the victorious alliance. Aquino's
coalition government is not itself anti-U.S.; it is, however,
broadly nationalist and stands to challenge entrenched
U.S. economic and military interests in the country.
The nationalist political platform of the party (PDP
LAB AN) that propelled Aquino to the presidency has
been responsible for attracting large youthful segments of
the urban middle and upper classes who would like to see
the Philippines plot a course of development that is not
tied with serving U.S. interests. These liberal elements
also detest the patronage politics of the old-style
politicians that make up Salvador Laurel's right-wing
UNNPO party. In addition, many of Aquino's close ad
visers are people who suffered actual persecution under
the Marcos dictatorship and who rightfully harbor some
anti-U.S. sentiments from what they regard its 20 years of
U.S. support for the Marcos dictatorship. In their opposi
tion to Marcos, they have in the past set up alliances with
leftist elements and organizations.
The Reagan Administration's paranoia of the Left's
challenge in the Philippines thus seems certain to destabi
lize the Aquino coalition. Indeed, Reagan's apprehension
regarding Aquino's associates was a major reason for his
holding on to Marcos up to the last minute. If the nature
of U.S. intervention is such as to undermine Aquino's
fledgling coalition by propping up the pro-U.S. right-wing
faction, then it is certain to ignite tensions and prevent the
consolidation of a truly pluralistic political system.
Reagan also appears inclined to move toward a military
solution to the insurgency problem, instead of encourag
ing political power sharing and accomodation. Such a
move would result in the rapid militarization of the
Philippines and an escalation of the communist insur
gency.
There remain formidable problems to be addressed by
the new Philippine leadership. But the manner in which
the Filipino people have liberated themselves attests to
their desire and ability to find solutions to their own prob
lems without intervention from the United States.

The Reagan Administrations so-called "dumping" of
the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship is being hailed by both
Congress and the media as a triumph of the Administra
tion's foreign policy. But the best that can be said about
Reagan's celebrated handling of the Philippine crisis is
simply that he averted bungling "this one" by defecting to
the winner's side almost at the very last moment.
The United States pulled the rug out from under
Marcos only when it became obvious that all was lost for
the dictator. In fact, Reagan had to be dragged into finally
abandoning Marcos, and only the State Department's
timely sense of political realism prevented what may have
been a disastrous attempt by Reagan to sustain a widely
discredited tyrant.

ABRACOSA ET AL.

The dubious implication that the United States played a
key role in restoring democracy in the Philippines cannot
disguise the fact that the United States abandoned Marcos
only because it had no choice in the face of overwhelming
odds against the dictator. It is hard for many Filipinos to
believe that the United States acted out of a long-standing
commitment to democracy in the Philippines.
It must not be forgotten that it was American support
that propped up Marcos for 20 years, and that, in fact, it
was Reagan's vacillation — including his earlier sugges
tion that his concern for the American bases in the
Philippines was what mattered most — that emboldened
Marcos to try to force his fraudulent election victory,
believing that he could continue to manipulate the United
States into accommodating him in exchange for the bases.
Reagan s final dumping of Marcos may have prevented a
potential bloodbath in the Philippines, but that does not
automatically absolve the United States from being held
accountable for the suffering and excesses caused by the
erstwhile U.S.-backed dictator.
The liberation of the Filipino people from the tyranny
of the Marcos regime is a tribute to the Filipinos' own ef
forts — not the United States. Unfortunately, the Reagan
Administration appears bent on capitalizing upon the im
pression that the United States brought about the return
of democracy to the Philippines to justify increased U.S.
involvement in the affairs of that country. The remarks of
Ramon Myers, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute
(Daily, Feb. 26), that this is a "golden time for the United
States to exercise a modernizing influence" in the
Philippines reflects a fundamental U.S. attitude of pater
nalism and self-righteous intervention in Philippine af
fairs.
U.S. involvement in Philippine affairs may not, in itself,
be undesirable if it were done out of genuine concern to
help that country build democratic institutions. But the
record of U.S. involvement in the Philippines belies these
noble concerns. It is U.S. self-interest that has always

dictated the nature of U.S. intervention in the Philippines,
and it has always been from a position of dominance that
U.S. involvement is carried out in the Philippines.
The United States undoubtedly is in a strong position to
intervene in Philippine political, economic and military af
fairs. But such intervention can be destabilizing to the
present government in the Philippines.
The Corazon Aquino government is a coalition of left
liberals, moderates and right-wing elements. Because of
that, it is especially vulnerable to destablizing forces that
might encourgage factionalism after the current
honeymoon stage of the victorious alliance. Aquino's
coalition government is not itself anti-U.S.; it is, however,
broadly nationalist and stands to challenge entrenched
U.S. economic and military interests in the country.
The nationalist political platform of the party (PDP
LAB AN) that propelled Aquino to the presidency has
been responsible for attracting large youthful segments of
the urban middle and upper classes who would like to see
the Philippines plot a course of development that is not
tied with serving U.S. interests. These liberal elements
also detest the patronage politics of the old-style
politicians that make up Salvador Laurel's right-wing
UNNPO party. In addition, many of Aquino's close ad
visers are people who suffered actual persecution under
the Marcos dictatorship and who rightfully harbor some
anti-U.S. sentiments from what they regard its 20 years of
U.S. support for the Marcos dictatorship. In their opposi
tion to Marcos, they have in the past set up alliances with
leftist elements and organizations.
The Reagan Administration's paranoia of the Left's
challenge in the Philippines thus seems certain to destabi
lize the Aquino coalition. Indeed, Reagan's apprehension
regarding Aquino's associates was a major reason for his
holding on to Marcos up to the last minute. If the nature
of U.S. intervention is such as to undermine Aquino's
fledgling coalition by propping up the pro-U.S. right-wing
faction, then it is certain to ignite tensions and prevent the
consolidation of a truly pluralistic political system.
Reagan also appears inclined to move toward a military
solution to the insurgency problem, instead of encourag
ing political power sharing and accomodation. Such a
move would result in the rapid militarization of the
Philippines and an escalation of the communist insur
gency.
There remain formidable problems to be addressed by
the new Philippine leadership. But the manner in which
the Filipino people have liberated themselves attests to
their desire and ability to find solutions to their own prob
lems without intervention from the United States.
