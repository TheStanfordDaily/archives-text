Ignore, don't fight
campus crusaders
In recent days there have been
speakers in White Plaza preaching a
set of values very different from those
of most Stanford students. I am dis
turbed by some of the speakers'
beliefs, but also by the reaction they
have had from students.
Watching these preachers makes
me feel like a spectator at a
gladiatorial combat, with insults
flying back and forth instead of sword
blows. I find it hard not to stop and
listen to this gratuitous verbal vio
lence: when I hear what the preachers
say, I want to shout and laugh at
them. But that's wrong of me. The
preachers are human and hold their
beliefs sincerely. It is a sign of our
own spite when we, the spectators,
dehumanize them with an abusive
response. When we show hatred
towards them, we are living up to
their expectation of us. Regardless of
whether or not they are filled with
Christian love towards us. we should

not respond with hate.
Certainly many of the spectators
gather because they are hurt by what
is being preached and want a chance
to answer. But what can be achieved
by answering? The only way we can
ever convince these speakers to
respect our values is to show them
that, in spite of the sins they see in us,
we really are kind, thoughtful, good
people. Laughing at them only
alienates them further from us and
feeds their self-righteousness and
contempt for others. I think it should
be obvious from their persistence that
large, hostile crowds simply fire them
up. The proper response to someone
who shouts meaningless abuse at you
is to walk quietly and humbly away. If
you really want to hear what the
preachers believe, or think you can
convince them of your own beliefs,
find them alone some time and sit
down for a respectful discussion. But
let's end the jeering in White Plaza.
Let's just walk away.

Stop coddling our
collegiate athletes
The recent jury decision against the
University of Georgia should be
hailed as a victory for every college in
America. The National Collegiate
Athletic Association's newly adopted
minimum entrance requirements for
athletes is one positive step toward
updating its archaic regulations. It
also helps to ward off the cancer of
academic desolation that daily
plagues our nation. Any child in this
country who has aspirations should
know that in order to achieve any
goal, he/she must work for it. This is
especially true for the student
athlete.
Many of today's college power
houses do not really care about what
you do to enrich your mind during
your brief tenure. The coaches get
paid to do one thing — win. Some will
go to great lengths to do it. They do
not realize that by courting many
scholastically deficient athletes, they
and their institutions help perpetuate

the cycic of poverty that exists in our
land of plenty.
The new standard is benefieial to
everyone concerned — parents,
teachers, coaches and most impor
tantly, the student-athlete. He/she
must he made fully aware at an early
age that if he/she doesn't do welj
enough in the classroom, he/she can't
set foot on the playing field. It is an
honor and a privilege to play major
college athletics. This jury decision
indicts everyone who has exploited
athletic talent while letting fine minds
deteriorate. No one says you have to
be an Einstein, but you must be able
to read, write, calculate and think suf
ficiently to compete in our tough soci
ety.
Preparation must be made for the
day the cheering stops and/or a
serious injury occurs. This court deci
sion is a major step towards true com
petition on and off the field. It
reiterates the old axiom: There is no
such thing as a free lunch.
