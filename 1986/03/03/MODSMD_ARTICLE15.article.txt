# Careerism distorts priorities
## 
### 
I returned to Stanford this quarter, after three months
in Europe, with renewed faith. Something about the expo
sure to other cultures convinced me of the richness, the
potential of human expeiience. A world existed beyond
the sometimes too narrow confines of American shores,
and I was reminded that people can and do live differently
than we. Life was, in short, good, and — with luck — was
going to get better. Imagine my rude awakening, then,
when I was introduced to my senior year residence: the
Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC).
The CPPC is, as one Daily reporter recently observed, a
senior's second home. Don't be deceived by the analogy,
though; the CPPC approximates home like Norman
Bates' motel approximates a Holiday Inn. That innocuous
sandstone exterior conceals a maelstrom of neuroses and
anxieties. I blithely walked in at the beginning of the quar
ter and fled 10 minutes later in absolute panic. I won't
relate in detail what goes on in there for fear of shocking
the weak-hearted; suffice it to say that J saw a lot of faces

I used to recognize with tight, pained expressions peering
at slips of white paper on a bulletin board and eyeing each
newly arrived potential competitor as if all they desired in
the world was a knife to lodge in said potential competi
tor's back. The letters CPPC stand for Career Planning
and Placement Center; they also stand for hysteria in a
pin-striped gray suit.
Don't blame us seniors. We are, after all, only doing
what one is supposed to do with a higher education. We
are getting jobs. Not just any jobs, mind you. but high
paying jobs. We want money, and lots of it.
At this point, a good liberal humanist usually trots out
platitudes about money not being everything, not being
able to buy happiness, etc., etc. The senior rolls his or her
eyes with the contempt that only familiarity brings, and
rushes off to the CPPC before the bidding for Goldman,
Sachs interviews closes. I will resist, for the moment,
the temptation to preach a sermon about the evils of
money-grubbing. Virginia Woolf once wrote that if she
had to choose the more important of two pivotal events in
her life — getting the vote and receiving a substantial in
heritance from her aunt — she would choose the money.
"Intellectual freedom," she said, "depends upon material
things."
In deference to Woolf, then. I will avoid asking our
career-conscious senior not to go to the CPPC; I only wish
he or she wouldn't rush there.
For something is being trampled in this mass, headlong
stampede to the CPPC and the careers and money
beyond. Careers and career-chasing have become all
consuming. The process begins early. We are told from
the outset that the career defines the human being and
money defines the career. Every small child in America is
asked at least twice a week what he wants to be when he

grows up, and if the message isn't made clear, it will be by
the time he's taken a few career aptitude tests in high
school.
In college, we are pressured to choose a lucrative
major, and we feel as if we have to defend any choice that
fails to fit the criterion. (I thought Human Biology
protected me from all that until last week, when an engi
neering professor here, upon learning what my major was,
asked skeptically, "How do you intend to make a living of
that?" Sometimes, you can't beat them or join them.)
Everywhere you turn, you are reminded of your responsi
bility to get a job and get it quick. The latest Newsweek
On Campus features two pages of hints about how to
dress for an interview. "Recruiters," the article soberly
warns, "could be turned off by any distracting display of
individuality."
Such foolishness is, I suppose, to be expected. It's only
practical, after all. A career is money; money is food,
clothing, housing, security, power and, according to
Woolf, intellectual freedom. But Woolf, 1 am certain, did
not mean to justify' mass obsession with monetary gain.
For Woolf, money provided a gateway to greater and
more important things. After conceding the dependency
of intellectual freedom upon a healthy bank account,
Woolf comes to the point of her argument. "Poetry
depends upon intellectual freedom," she wrote. Woolf
believed that art was the most important thing in the
world, that appreciating and contributing to the beauty of*
the world and of humanity itself was the highest endeavor
to which man could aspire. One did not need to dedicate
the whole of one's life to money and its pursuit for thoss
purposes.
Seniors at the CPPC, of course, are scarcely concerned
about poetry; in some cases, they're not even concerned
about intellectual freedom. They also, it might be added,
lack well-to-do aunts who die and leave them a comforta
ble guaranteed annual income. But ask seniors if they
want to expend so much time and energy in the quest for
the perfect career. Ask them if what their careers will re
quire of them is what they really want to be doing 40-plus
hours a week. Ask them if one's career can fulfill all one's
needs, and whether the needs it does fulfill are important
enough to subordinate all other needs.
The less idealistic senior will, no doubt, remind us that
this is a capitalist system; one has to accumulate wealth, or
be dominated by those who have it. I am too cynical to
repudiate this argument completely, but even capitalism
doesn't necessitate the explosion of anxiety walking into
the CPPC engenders. Other cultures — even capitalist
cultures from which our own is partly derived — have
managed to find a more tolerable mix of monetary and
non-monetary personal pursuits. We need not com
placently accept all the precepts of a mass-market culture
gone mad. How will it ever change if we don't even make
an attempt to think of things differently?
If such sentimentality does not move you, ponder these
words from the unlikely lips of Paul Volcker. chairman of
the Federal Reserve: "What's the subject of life — to get
rich? These fellows out there getting rich could be dancing
around the real subject of life."
I think I'll heed Virginia Woolf and Paul Volcker. Call
it naivete, call it a platitude, but money isn't everything. I
will go back to the CPPC. But I will walk. Slowly.
