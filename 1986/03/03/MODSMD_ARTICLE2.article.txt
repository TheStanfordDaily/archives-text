# Harvard, Stanford grads think alike

### STEVE STREED Senior staff writer 
Stanford and Harvard graduates
have more in common than they
would like to think; they oppose
current defense spending, enjoy
their jobs, are committed to civic
and cultural involvement and have
a one in five chance of being a mil
lionaire. according to a new
nationwide survey.
Thirty-six hundred graduates of
the two schools completed ques
tionnaires for a survey conducted
by the Yankelovich, Skelly and
White research firm of New York.
Alumni organizations of the two
universities commissioned the
study, and the results have been
published in the spring issues of
Stanford Magazine and Harvard
Magazine.
In an article written for the
publications, Florence Skelly,
president of the research firm, said
Stanford and Harvard graduates
appear to be "a group of indepen
dent thinkers, not swayed by fash
ion, rhetoric or simple solutions,
marching resolutely to the beat of
a different drummer. . . ."
In the area of defense, more
than four out of five (83 percent)
of the Stanford and Harvard
alumni find fault with the defense
budget, and 82 percent favor cuts
in military spending. Forty-three
percent believe high defense ex
penditures are jeopardizing the
economy, while 40 percent say the
problem lies in the way the
defense budget is allocated. In ad
dition. 74 percent say the military
industrial complex has too much
power.
The graduates "have it .ill in the

realm of work â€” jobs which
they want to commit their lives to
plus far higher than average eco
nomic yields," Skelly reported,
adding that over half (57 percent)
can't imagine a more enjoyable
job than they have.
The median family income for a
Stanford or Harvard alumnus is
$72,000 a year, about three times
that of the average family in the
United States. The median net
worth of a graduate is $345,000,
and one in five is a millionaire.
Four out of five own their own
homes.
John Bethell. editor of Harvard
Magazine, said in an interview
yesterday that he felt the number
of millionaires in the survey seems
"almost modest" in relation to the
times and the high cost of living.
Seventy percent of the Stanford
and Harvard graduates who
responded to the survey said they
are involved in local cultural and
charitable organizations. Fourteen
percent describe themselves as
influential in local political and
civic affairs. One in 20 said they
have influence in state and na
tional political organizations, and
about one in four (24 percent) re
port having served government
in some capacity.
Overall, "there is a core of per
haps 10 to 15 percent of alumni
involved in government and
politics, with half those veiy active
in electoral politics," Skelly re
ported.
Skelly wrote in the article that
her firm "secretly hoped to dis
cover dramatic . . . disjunctions
