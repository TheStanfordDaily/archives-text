## Solo living: a look at Stanford's 'single' scene 
### ELIZABETH JONES 
This year Greg Alessandra, a junior living
in a single room at Lathrop House, can hit the
snooze button on his alarm clock for hours
without having to worry that the noise bothers
his roommate.
Alessandra and about 390 other Stanford
singles like him can plaster their walls with
Garfield or Devo posters, or with Hindu cal
ligraphy — there's no one to stop them.
These lucky loners can stay up until 4 a.m.
(or get up at 4 a.m.) without tiptoeing around
in the dark.
They can talk on the phone in privacy, and
they can count on a place of complete peace
and quiet if they need to get away from their
busy lives for a while.
"Most people want a single," Alessandra
says. For upperclassmen, this is true. Accord
ing to a 1985 opinion poll, most juniors and
seniors, if given first choice in room selection,
said they would like a single.
This point was echoed by Naranja Resident
Assistant Rupali Apte. "Naranja has 12
freshman doubles that are some of the small
est rooms on campus. Someone ends up in
these rooms every year. Someone always gets
stuck with the triples, too," she said.
Apte said that after experiencing these
smaller rooms for several years, most upper
classmen will elect to live in a single.
So what are the strategies for getting a
room of one's own?
In most houses, rooms are allocated ac
cording to a point system.
Criteria such as a student's year in school,
the number of quarters the student has lived
in his or her particular dorm, any house
offices he or she might hold, and the type of
room (double or triple) the student has lived
in previously affect one's accumulation of
priority points.
The person with the greatest number of
points picks his room first. Ties are usually

broken by numbers drawn randomly from a
hat.
A senior who is returning to a dorm for the
third year, and who had lived in a triple for
the past two years, would have an excellent
chance for a single.
A few houses, however, do things differ
ently.
At Synergy, for example, students get a
single only if they have a specific need for
one. Examples of special circumstances that
would give someone in Synergy a single in

elude having a heavy work load, a demanding
joh, a serious relationship or special emo
tional problems.
But the odds of getting a single also depend
on the houses themselves.
Campus-wide, about one in every seven
rooms is likely to be a single, but some dorms
have no singles, while others have more than
50 percent solo accommodations.
None of the all-freshman houses or the
Cowell cluster houses, for example, have any
singles (except those reserved for RAs).

The American Studies House has only one
single, and it is reserved for the house
manager.
Lambda Nu, on the other hand, gives its
only available single to its house treasurer.
EAST House, an Asian theme house in
Governor's Corner, has three house managers
and four theme associates who are entitled to
seven of the house's 12 singles. The French
House is similar.
But in other houses, getting a single is not
quite so impossible.

Theta Chi, a special priority house located
at 576 Alvarado, has 19 singles and only 29
people. *•
"Almost everyone who wants a single at
Theta Chi gets one," said one resident.
Other dorms with a high ratio of singles in
clude Grove House, Hurlbert House and
Roble Hall.
According to Rodger Whitney, an assistant
dean in the Res Ed office, whether a student
is male or female does not make it easier — or
harder — to get a single room.
Whitney acknowledged that there are more
men than women on campus, but he empha
sized that "students are still drawing agaias.t
each other. Whether or not it's a smaller or.
larger pool doesn't matter."
However, for students living in the
graduate engineering dorm, Crothers
Memorial, it is more advantageous to be
female. Though there are few women in the'
graduate engineering program, almost 40 per-'
cent of the singles in Cro Mem are still
reserved for them. That means almost all
women in their second year at Cro Mem are
in singles.
Of course, singles aren't for everyone. Fdr
some students a single room can get lonely.
A resident of Phi Sig said her single is ap
propriate for her schedule this year, but it is
not what she would have wanted every year.
"Sometimes the hours can get long," she
said.
Arline Gray, who coordinates room assign
ments at Roble, said transfer students are put
in one of the dorm's 15 triples so that "they
will feel welcome."
"New students need upperclassmen to
show them around," Gray said.
But others find life easier without having to
step over piles of a roomie's clothes, books,
letters, boxes and other accumulated objects.
Living in a single room, they say, is the
ideal residential arrangement.

in his or her particular dorm, any house
offices he or she might hold, and the type of
room (double or triple) the student has lived
in previously affect one's accumulation of
priority points.
The person with the greatest number of
points picks his room first. Ties are usually

broken by numbers drawn randomly from a
hat.
A senior who is returning to a dorm for the
third year, and who had lived in a triple for
the past two years, would have an excellent
chance for a single.
A few houses, however, do things differ
ently.
At Synergy, for example, students get a
single only if they have a specific need for
one. Examples of special circumstances that
would give someone in Synergy a single in

elude having a heavy work load, a demanding
joh, a serious relationship or special emo
tional problems.
But the odds of getting a single also depend
on the houses themselves.
Campus-wide, about one in every seven
rooms is likely to be a single, but some dorms
have no singles, while others have more than
50 percent solo accommodations.
None of the all-freshman houses or the
Cowell cluster houses, for example, have any
singles (except those reserved for RAs).

The American Studies House has only one
single, and it is reserved for the house
manager.
Lambda Nu, on the other hand, gives its
only available single to its house treasurer.
EAST House, an Asian theme house in
Governor's Corner, has three house managers
and four theme associates who are entitled to
seven of the house's 12 singles. The French
House is similar.
But in other houses, getting a single is not
quite so impossible.

Theta Chi, a special priority house located
at 576 Alvarado, has 19 singles and only 29
people. *•
"Almost everyone who wants a single at
Theta Chi gets one," said one resident.
Other dorms with a high ratio of singles in
clude Grove House, Hurlbert House and
Roble Hall.
According to Rodger Whitney, an assistant
dean in the Res Ed office, whether a student
is male or female does not make it easier — or
harder — to get a single room.
Whitney acknowledged that there are more
men than women on campus, but he empha
sized that "students are still drawing agaias.t
each other. Whether or not it's a smaller or.
larger pool doesn't matter."
However, for students living in the
graduate engineering dorm, Crothers
Memorial, it is more advantageous to be
female. Though there are few women in the'
graduate engineering program, almost 40 per-'
cent of the singles in Cro Mem are still
reserved for them. That means almost all
women in their second year at Cro Mem are
in singles.
Of course, singles aren't for everyone. Fdr
some students a single room can get lonely.
A resident of Phi Sig said her single is ap
propriate for her schedule this year, but it is
not what she would have wanted every year.
"Sometimes the hours can get long," she
said.
Arline Gray, who coordinates room assign
ments at Roble, said transfer students are put
in one of the dorm's 15 triples so that "they
will feel welcome."
"New students need upperclassmen to
show them around," Gray said.
But others find life easier without having to
step over piles of a roomie's clothes, books,
letters, boxes and other accumulated objects.
Living in a single room, they say, is the
ideal residential arrangement.

This year Greg Alessandra, a junior living
in a single room at Lathrop House, can hit the
snooze button on his alarm clock for hours
without having to worry that the noise bothers
his roommate.
Alessandra and about 390 other Stanford
singles like him can plaster their walls with
Garfield or Devo posters, or with Hindu cal
ligraphy — there's no one to stop them.
These lucky loners can stay up until 4 a.m.
(or get up at 4 a.m.) without tiptoeing around
in the dark.
They can talk on the phone in privacy, and
they can count on a place of complete peace
and quiet if they need to get away from their
busy lives for a while.
"Most people want a single," Alessandra
says. For upperclassmen, this is true. Accord
ing to a 1985 opinion poll, most juniors and
seniors, if given first choice in room selection,
said they would like a single.
This point was echoed by Naranja Resident
Assistant Rupali Apte. "Naranja has 12
freshman doubles that are some of the small
est rooms on campus. Someone ends up in
these rooms every year. Someone always gets
stuck with the triples, too," she said.
Apte said that after experiencing these
smaller rooms for several years, most upper
classmen will elect to live in a single.
So what are the strategies for getting a
room of one's own?
In most houses, rooms are allocated ac
cording to a point system.
Criteria such as a student's year in school,
the number of quarters the student has lived
in his or her particular dorm, any house
offices he or she might hold, and the type of
room (double or triple) the student has lived
in previously affect one's accumulation of
priority points.
