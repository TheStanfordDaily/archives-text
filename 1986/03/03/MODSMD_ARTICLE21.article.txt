# Street theater comes to the Farm

### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
Got a message? A point of view? Are things on
the political scene just burning you up? Have you
found that posters, rallies or speeches just don't
motivate people the way you'd like them to?
Well, David Catanzarite has the class for you.
Catanzarite, a 1978 Stanford graduate, will be
teaching a class on Street Theatre and Brecht here
next quarter. His soft brown eyes shine with pas
sion as he describes his work.
"Street theatre is both exciting and demanding.
It brings theatre out to all the people. We don't
charge money so we don't have to be predictable
like most theatre that is performed indoors has to
be," he said.
Catanzarite also emphasized the opportunity for
audience participation in street theatre. "We really
encourage the audience to get involved and partici
pate," he commented. "It can be taxing on an audi
ence's imagination, but it can also be more emo

tionally rewarding."
Catanzarite's class next quarter will deal mainly
with Bertolt Brecht, an early 20th century German
playwright who had a great influence on political
theatre.
"We will be particularly concerned with Brecht
because he is the foremost theorist for political
theatre in our time," Catanzarite said."He realized
the impact a popular art form could have on
politics."
"There is the idea in this country that art has to
be for art's sake, separate from politics. I don't
believe that. Theatre, because it dramatizes, is ideal
for communicating a message," he said.
Catanzarite first got involved in political theatre
while he was a student here in 1977.
"There was quite an active movement to divest
in South Africa even then, and we got together and
staged some very effective political theatre," he
recalled. "We had black students arrest white stu
dents for violating mock pass laws in dorms around

campus. The idea of what it is like for a minority to
oppress a majority really hit home."
Catanzarite encourages actors, dancers, writers
and politically concerned people to get involved in
his class. The class will focus on collective perfor
mance and will teach fundamental improvisation
and physical theatre skills.
Catanzarite said the political content of the per
formances in the class will depend entirely upon
what the student interests are. He said he believes
that every issue has a political side. "If students are
just worried about alcohol abuse we could do a
piece on that. Whatever people are concerned
about," he said.
According to Catanzarite, students taking this
class can expect to perform several pieces, includ
ing two of Brecht's. Though the class definitely will
perform on the Stanford campus, be forewarned —
in the past, Catanzarite's classes have performed in
such unlikely places as Union Square and BART
platforms.
