## University president's journal too precise to be 'disarmingly candid' 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
"Is My Armor Straight? A Year In The Life Of A
University President"
Richard Berendzen
Maryland, Adler and Adler, 1986
The appeal of a journal lies in its sense of
privacy, the feeling of an unself-conscious human
being pouring out inner thoughts. Reading one can
be like entering another person's life, peeking into
what was meant to be shielded from public
scrutiny.
To read Richard Berendzen's day-by-day ac
count of a year in his life as president of The Amer
ican University in Washington, D.C., is to experi
ence just the opposite.

Sincerity. The 'no one's
going to read this
anyway so I'm going to
spill my guts' attitude.
That was the missing
something.

This journal feels as if it were meant to be read
and thought about by everyone imaginable, from
housewives to professionals to students to other
university presidents. And indeed it was.
In his prologue, Berendzen confesses that, at the
urging of a senior editor at Reader's Digest, he
began to keep a journal with the intention of even
tually publishing "a personal account of my life as a
university president and as a man."
That intention is unfortunately clear throughout
"Is My Armor Straight?"
Not that the book isn't well written. The prose is
crisp, and the subject matter, if not tantalizing, is at
least interesting. Most of us have probably won
dered what a university president really does, and
it's somewhat gratifying to learn that it's not all

paperwork and speech-giving and squashing of stu
dent protests.
It's just that, well, 1 spent the first half of the
book wondering what was giving me the vague
feeling of dissatisfaction, of a missing something. I
spent the rest of the book finding out that it wasn't
just the lack of something, it was also the presence
of an unwanted something.
Self-consciousness. The "All right, I'm going to
tell the truth for everyone to know" attitude. That
was the unwanted something.
Sincerity. The "no one's going to see this so I'm
going to spill my guts" attitude. That was the mis
sing something.
There's really nothing wrong with the first atti
tude. It has its place, but not in a journal. It makes
the entries seem contrived.
The self-consciousness really comes out in an
outstanding feature of this book: name-dropping.
After the first few entries, it becomes obvious that
every important or famous person who ever steps
into Washington must be and will be mentioned,
from Ed Meese to Ted Koppel. It becomes rather
irritating after awhile, especially because
Berendzen is so clearly awed by these folks.
Not only the famous attract his attention. One of
Berendzen's major activities is pursuing the
wealthy. Soliciting donations, large ones, is a prime
concern for him, as it is for many private univer
sities. In his case, the school's need for a sports and
convocation center, and the students' impatience
with delays in getting one, make acquisition of
funds quite urgent. In the school year chronicled in
the journal, Berendzen pursues a filthy rich and
somewhat controversial Arab in hopes that he will
make the multi-million dollar donation necessary
to start building the center. Berendzen succeeds,
and the center will be constructed and named after
its main benefactor, Adnan Khashoggi.
Giving lectures and talking on radio shows about
education is another one of Berendzen's salient ac
tivities. He seems to have spoken up and down the
East Coast.
The journal seems intended to showcase an ex
ample of the ideal university president. The
desirable aspects of such a life are emphasized: the
recognition; the chance to hobnob with important
officials, rich patrons and sundry influential people;
the rewards of nurturing an institution of learning
and the opportunity to lecture with authority on
education. The demands of a highly public job, the
long hours of work, the frustrations of dealing with
faculty, students and administrators and attempting

to please everyone while doing what's best for the
school; these are mentioned but downplayed.
Berendzen seems to have little problem dealing
with any event — good or bad.
"Is My Armor Straight?" is not a page-turner by
any means. It's superficially interesting, gilded with
good news and sparkling names. The head of a uni
versity deserves better treatment. An honest ac
count would talk about the compromises made, the
constraints, the endless hours and the sacrifices, as
well as the triumphs and the associations with the
cream of American society. This account is too
glamorous to be taken seriously.

Maryland, Adler and Adler, 1986
The appeal of a journal lies in its sense of
privacy, the feeling of an unself-conscious human
being pouring out inner thoughts. Reading one can
be like entering another person's life, peeking into
what was meant to be shielded from public
scrutiny.
To read Richard Berendzen's day-by-day ac
count of a year in his life as president of The Amer
ican University in Washington, D.C., is to experi
ence just the opposite.

Sincerity. The 'no one's
going to read this
anyway so I'm going to
spill my guts' attitude.
That was the missing
something.

This journal feels as if it were meant to be read
and thought about by everyone imaginable, from
housewives to professionals to students to other
university presidents. And indeed it was.
In his prologue, Berendzen confesses that, at the
urging of a senior editor at Reader's Digest, he
began to keep a journal with the intention of even
tually publishing "a personal account of my life as a
university president and as a man."
That intention is unfortunately clear throughout
"Is My Armor Straight?"
Not that the book isn't well written. The prose is
crisp, and the subject matter, if not tantalizing, is at
least interesting. Most of us have probably won
dered what a university president really does, and
it's somewhat gratifying to learn that it's not all

paperwork and speech-giving and squashing of stu
dent protests.
It's just that, well, 1 spent the first half of the
book wondering what was giving me the vague
feeling of dissatisfaction, of a missing something. I
spent the rest of the book finding out that it wasn't
just the lack of something, it was also the presence
of an unwanted something.
Self-consciousness. The "All right, I'm going to
tell the truth for everyone to know" attitude. That
was the unwanted something.
Sincerity. The "no one's going to see this so I'm
going to spill my guts" attitude. That was the mis
sing something.
There's really nothing wrong with the first atti
tude. It has its place, but not in a journal. It makes
the entries seem contrived.
The self-consciousness really comes out in an
outstanding feature of this book: name-dropping.
After the first few entries, it becomes obvious that
every important or famous person who ever steps
into Washington must be and will be mentioned,
from Ed Meese to Ted Koppel. It becomes rather
irritating after awhile, especially because
Berendzen is so clearly awed by these folks.
Not only the famous attract his attention. One of
Berendzen's major activities is pursuing the
wealthy. Soliciting donations, large ones, is a prime
concern for him, as it is for many private univer
sities. In his case, the school's need for a sports and
convocation center, and the students' impatience
with delays in getting one, make acquisition of
funds quite urgent. In the school year chronicled in
the journal, Berendzen pursues a filthy rich and
somewhat controversial Arab in hopes that he will
make the multi-million dollar donation necessary
to start building the center. Berendzen succeeds,
and the center will be constructed and named after
its main benefactor, Adnan Khashoggi.
Giving lectures and talking on radio shows about
education is another one of Berendzen's salient ac
tivities. He seems to have spoken up and down the
East Coast.
The journal seems intended to showcase an ex
ample of the ideal university president. The
desirable aspects of such a life are emphasized: the
recognition; the chance to hobnob with important
officials, rich patrons and sundry influential people;
the rewards of nurturing an institution of learning
and the opportunity to lecture with authority on
education. The demands of a highly public job, the
long hours of work, the frustrations of dealing with
faculty, students and administrators and attempting

to please everyone while doing what's best for the
school; these are mentioned but downplayed.
Berendzen seems to have little problem dealing
with any event — good or bad.
"Is My Armor Straight?" is not a page-turner by
any means. It's superficially interesting, gilded with
good news and sparkling names. The head of a uni
versity deserves better treatment. An honest ac
count would talk about the compromises made, the
constraints, the endless hours and the sacrifices, as
well as the triumphs and the associations with the
cream of American society. This account is too
glamorous to be taken seriously.
