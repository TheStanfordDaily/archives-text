# Zyzzyva's 1st year
## 
### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
Zyzzyva, one of the newest and
slickest West Coast literary jour
nals, has managed to make its
"last words" last for over a year
now, and it is celebrating with a
proudly purple first anniversary
issue which has just hit the stands.
When I got my first copy of Zyz
zyva — bright red with what
looked like a big cockroach on the
cover — I wasn't too sure if the
magazine was going to make it. It
was (and is) slick but slightly cute;
a zyzzyva is a \ind of a bug, but it's
also the last word in the diction
ary, a fact which gives rise to the
magazine's slogan, "The last
word: West Coast writers and ar
tists."
I'm not sure whether that means
the magazine is the last word on
West Coast writers and artists or
simply that we West Coasters have
the last word, because we're on
the edge of the continent.
The stuff of the first issue was
clearly from the geographic, rather
than the cutting, edge of American
literature, but it seems as if the
magazine has become better es
tablished. It's been seen by impor
tant West Coast authors as a
legitimate forum, and the new
issue includes a chapter from Stan
ford English Prof. Arturo Islas'
novel-in-progess, Vikram Seth's
about-to-be published verse novel
and Edward Abbey's novel-in
progress. It also includes artwork
by Christopher Rauschenberg and
Linda Connor.-
The content of Zyzzyva, despite
the funky name, is largely tradi
tional fiction about West Coast
folk; there's a big emphasis on in
ternational and minority
literature. The best thing about
the magazine has been this em
phasis. I feared at first Zyzzyva
would be as filled with Califor
niaese as the New Yorker is with
New York lingo. Though the

writing and artwork is by Califor
nians, these aren't Californians in
the Coppertone sense of the word
but writers with vastly different
cultural and ethnic heritages,
which makes for interesting
reading. Moreover, the work isn't
chosen because it's "minority"
work, but rather because the
editors thought it was the best that
they had; the magazine still has a
literary rather than a "cross
cultural" feel to it.
Though there's a lot of variety
in Zyzzyva, the writing is still
largely traditional — either the
writers who submit to Zyzzyva are
clinging to the safer limbs of
literature, or the editors don't
want to take chances. Either way,
the magazine suffers a bit from the
decision to include only West
Coast writers. True, there isn't a
major West Coast literary maga
zine, but maybe that's because it
isn't a good idea to have geo
graphical constraints on your sub
mission. If West Coast talent is as
good as the editor claims, then it
should be able to achieve fair rep
resentation in a magazine that
stresses quality, not locality.
Maybe the intention is to create
a more unified West Coast literaiy
community. That's certainly a
good idea, if one is to believe that
most of the West Coast has about
as much literary potential as a
Hallmark card. Maybe writers on
this side of the country do need to
band together and stick up for
themselves, but is Zyzzyva the an
swer? It depends on whether or
not you identify with an editorial
policy which combines searching
for "the best" with providing "a
good read." If you're interested in
West Coast writing, you should
read Zyzzyva just to see what their
perception of West Coast writing
is — and if you disagree, write
them and tell them. One of the
best things about Zyzzyva is that
it's a young magazine, with some
recognition, a lot of potential and
room to grow.
