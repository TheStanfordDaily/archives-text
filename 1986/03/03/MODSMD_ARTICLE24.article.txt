"Iron Will: The Life And Letters Of Jane Stanford"
By Gunther Nagel
Stanford, Stanford Aluinni Association, 1986
The late, great Leland and Jane Stanford have obviously left
their mark on the University. Where else can you find a student
body that dances on the graves of its founders every Halloween?
But though we all know that the Stanfords built this place as a
memorial to their little Leland, and that the elder Leland was
something of a railroad robber-baron, what do any of us know
about Jane?
My first acquaintance with Jane Stanford was during a
women's history class when we learned about "the 400," which
referred to the Railroad Baroness' decree that no more than 400
women should attend Stanford University at any time, ever. I
developed the idea that she was probably a typical Victorian
matron, who gave occasional doubtful advice to Leland and
probably was otherwise seen and not heard.
Gunther Nagel's book, therefore, had more than a few
surprises in store for me. Jane was unquestionably Victorian —
but after Leland's death in 1892, she was very much seen and
heard. In fact, according to Nagel, she saved the University from
bankruptcy and ruin through sheer force of what he calls her
"iron will."

The book is a roughly chronological series of letters by and to
Jane Stanford connected by biographical text. The text/letter
juxtapostion works better than in many similar works I've read
— there's a good sense of continuity. Nagel, an ex-Stanfordite
and medical school professor, got his B. A. in 1917 (a little more
than a decade after Jane's death), so he has a first-hand grasp of
the events.
Nagel doesn't tell us much about Jane's early years: he briefly
explains that she was the child of well-off. though not wealthy,
parents in Albany. N.Y. She had a traditional upbringing and
tradional values but was always an independent spirit. "A sincere
religious feeling and a belief in old-fashioned virtues came
naturally with Jane's upbringing. Self assurance and indepen
dence were her own posession." Nagel writes. "She was not
easily intimidated. She liked to dance and one Sunday was
publicly reprimanded for this by her preacher. The following
week she attended a different church."
Eventually, Nagel explains, Jane was "courted ... by a neigh
bor lad" who turned out to be Leland Stanford. The couple
married, and soon moved to California, then back to Albany,
then back to California again so that Leland could run in (and
win) the California gubernatorial election. At the same time,
Leland became president of the Central Pacific Railroad Co.
What follows is the well-known part of the story; the Stan
ford's son, Leland, died after a brief career as a rich young
genius, and the grief-stricken couple built the University.
Jane gave her husband advice in the University's early years,
but she didn't have too much say and was little prepared to be the
sole overseer of Stanford when her husband died four years later.
And to make matters even more complicated, the state of Cali
fornia sued the Stanford estate shortly after Leland's death,
trying to collect railroad loans that weren't yet due. A successful
collection would have bankrupted the University.
Obviously things all worked out for the best in the end. Jane
got to keep the University and resume her free-spending habits
— during the financial crisis she had to cut her monthly
household allowance from $ 10.000 to $350, but towards the end
of her life, she resumed globe-hopping and frequently made
policy decisions while "taking the waters" for her health.
"Iron Will is a beautiful book. Since it is a revised edition, the
editors had more time to spend on the actual production, and it
shows. One of the interesting new additions is a series of mar
ginal illustrations and notes that provide a chronological context
for the material. Though sometimes the commentaries are dis
tracting. it's interesting to learn that basketball was being in
vented about the same time Leland Stanford was saying his last
words. Also, the pictures are wonderful — particularly a shot of
the campus that shows the monumental, now-defunct Memorial
Arch towering over the Quad.
The problem is that it's a bit too beautiful — sort of a
gentleman's attempt at biography. Incidents such as the Ross af
fair. in which Jane Stanford ordered the dismissal of Prof. Ed
ward Ross because of his socialist leanings, are mentioned, but
not described; Nagel finds it "not worth while" to give this a
detailed description.
I have no information about Jane to compare with Nagel's, but

most of the information I've read about Leland's involvement in
the railroad business is much more critical. Nagel merely omits
what wouldn't be pleasent to discuss. True, this is a biography of
Jane, and it shouldn't dwell on Leland's foibles, but it's difficult
to believe that all of Leland's dirty dealing in the railroad busi
ness had no effect on Jane's life.
Despite the glossiness, there is plenty in "Iron Will" to amuse
and interest. Some of Nagel's gentlemanly comments are pre
cious in themselves; of the older Jane, he remarks, "The pangs of
hunger were not among the tribulations upon which Jane Stan
ford had ever been called upon to bear, and as a result, her
weight became uncontrollable."
One of the many surprises in the book was an account of Jane's
correspondence with Susan B. Anthony. It seems that Jane and
Leland provided free railroad passes to Anthony to show their
support of the feminist movement, something you'd never expect
from the originator of "the 400." Actually, Nagel tells us that
Jane, who was also a fan of women's sports, enacted the 400 rule
because Stanford's relatively tolerant atmosphere resulted in
landslide numbers of women applicants. She thought 400 women
would always be just under half the total population. Well, we've
come a long way. Janey. Wouldn't you be surprised.
