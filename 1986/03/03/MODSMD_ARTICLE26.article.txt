# Berry to speak

### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
Poet and novelist Wendell
Berry, distinguished both as an
author and a spokesman for
conservation, will read from his
works tonight at 8 p.m. in An
nenherg Auditorium.
Bciiy, brought to Stanford
by the Jean and Bill Lane
lecture series, hits written over
a dozen collections of poetry,
novels and essay collections.
His most recent works are
"Collected Poems, 1957-
1982" and "Standing by
Words," a collection of literary
essays.
Berry, a Kentucky native,
wrote and taught in California
and New York before returning
permanently to his 75-acre
Kentucky farm. His three
books on agriculture, co-edited
with agricultural researcher
Wes Jackson and conser
vationist Bruce Coleman, attest
to his commitment to
"common sense" sustenance
argiculture. He has also written
about Kentucky in several
novels, including "Nathan
Coulter" and "A Place On
Earth."
Berry has two main concerns
in his work: a love of language
and its musical quality, and a
love of the land. Language, ac
cording to Berry, is both a
source of confusion and a
means of clarity, and the land is
a source of traditional values
such as community spirit and
an emphasis on family life. Like
those of James Merrill, his
poems recall a largely vanished
rural tradition, and the values
within that tradition that some
believe must endure if we are
to survive.
