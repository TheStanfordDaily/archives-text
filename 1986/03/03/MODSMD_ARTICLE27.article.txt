## Seniors get flowers, then lay Trojans to rest 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
For the 5,121 faithful who turned
their backs on a perfect spring after
noon Saturday to catch the home
finale for the Stanford men's basket
ball team, it was a last look at the
mainstays of the Cardinal program,
but a look at things to come as well.
Before the game against USC, the
team's five seniors were recognized at
center court and given a standing
ovation for their four years of helping
to turn around the basketball pro
gram here. Then they went out and,
with a little help from the underclas
smen, soundly b6at the Trojans 85-
64.
It was the seniors' day, but fresh
man Todd Lichti had the major con
tribution, scoring 22 points to lead
the Cardinal.
Senior guard Keith Ramee wasn't
about to be overshadowed, though.
Ramee dished out nine assists for the
game, and his last one, a feed to
Lichti underneath with 7:09 to play,
was the 500 th of his career. Ramee
had already become the Cardinal's
all-time assist leader in his junior
season.
"It was one of my goals to reach
500,"' Ramee said. "1 was just trying
to hold onto the moment."
In addition to Ramee, forwards
Andy Fischer and Neil Johnson were
playing their final game at Maples
Pavilion. Forward Earl Koberlein and
guard Steve Brown were also on
hand, but they were both sidelined
earlier this year with injuries.
"I wanted this game so badly for
the seniors," Davis said. "1 feel that
our seniors laid the foundation of a
solid program. We have established
stability and a winning attitude, and
these seniors deserve all the credit."
And Davis' team seemed to share
his desire to let the seniors go out in
style. The Cardinal worked its fast
break offense to perfection in the first
half to open a 44-28 halftime lead,
then extended the margin in the
second half. Stanford's biggest lead

was a 74-51 advantage that came
with 6:11 left, and from then on it
was just a matter of when to take out
the seniors for their standing ovation.
That came at the 2:51 mark, as
Davis took his time to let each of his
veterans savor their final victory on
the home court.
The victory was Stanford's fifth
straight against the Trojans dating
back to 1984, including sweeps of the

Stanford improved to 8-8 in the
Pac-10, 14-14 overall. The Cardinal
is tied for tifth place with Oregon
State.
"Why have we done so well against
USC?" Davis said. "I feel it is just a
coincidence that we happen to play so

well against them. 1 know they were
hurting without Derrick Dowell. We
played well against them down there,
too."
Davis was referring to the in
definite suspension last week of
Dowell, the Trojans' second leading
scorer, for disciplinary reasons.
Dowell had been averaging 15.5
points and 7.8 rebounds per game,
and he had scored 13 against Stan
ford when the teams first met in Los
Angeles.
"Obviously," USC Coach Stan
Morrison said, "Stanford played with
more emotion than we did. They beat
us in every phase of the game."
At the offensive end, Stanford
opened up its running game as well as
it has all season. "It's a fine line with
our style," Davis said. "It's tough to
learn. We want our players to have
the freedom to run, but still have pa
tience. We have to teach them to play
under control."
"We didn't get back on defense,"
Morrison said. "We were continually
chasing the rebounder down the
court. We would be two steps behind
every time, and when you do that,
you're fighting a losing battle."
Defensively, as usual, the Cardinal
pressured USC all over the court and
forced 20 turnovers, 12 in the
decisive first half. And on the boards,
the Cardinal held an impressive 37-
22 edge.
Much of that was due to the im
proved play of centers Howard
Wright and Eric Reveno. Both had
been held scoreless in Thursday
night's loss to Oregon State, but they
came back with a vengeance Satur
day. Wright scored 12 points and had
seven rebounds in 24 minutes, and
Reveno had perhaps his best game of
the year with eight points and six
rebounds in 16 minutes.
"Howard Wright," Davis said,
"played a fine game today. He knew
he had made a lot of freshman
mistakes against Oregon State, and I
thought he redeemed himself today.
Howard has a lot of pride, and he
keeps getting better and better."

Defensively, as usual, the Cardinal
pressured USC all over the court and
forced 20 turnovers, 12 in the
decisive first half. And on the boards,
the Cardinal held an impressive 37-
22 edge.
Much of that was due to the im
proved play of centers Howard
Wright and Eric Reveno. Both had
been held scoreless in Thursday
night's loss to Oregon State, but they
came back with a vengeance Satur
day. Wright scored 12 points and had
seven rebounds in 24 minutes, and
Reveno had perhaps his best game of
the year with eight points and six
rebounds in 16 minutes.
"Howard Wright," Davis said,
"played a fine game today. He knew
he had made a lot of freshman
mistakes against Oregon State, and I
thought he redeemed himself today.
Howard has a lot of pride, and he
keeps getting better and better."

With 2:51 to play in Saturday's game with USC, Stanford Coach Tom Davis took Andy Fischer and fellow
seniors Keith Ramee and Neil Johnson out of the contest one by one to enable each to hear the cheers of the
Maples Pavilion crowd one last time. While it was the seniors, including the injured Steve Brown and Earl
Koberlein, who got the standing ovations, the whole team deserved applause after routing the Trojans 85-64.
For the 5,121 faithful who turned
their backs on a perfect spring after
noon Saturday to catch the home
finale for the Stanford men's basket
ball team, it was a last look at the
mainstays of the Cardinal program,
but a look at things to come as well.
Before the game against USC, the
team's five seniors were recognized at
center court and given a standing
ovation for their four years of helping
to turn around the basketball pro
gram here. Then they went out and,
with a little help from the underclas
smen, soundly b6at the Trojans 85-
64.
It was the seniors' day, but fresh
man Todd Lichti had the major con
tribution, scoring 22 points to lead
the Cardinal.
Senior guard Keith Ramee wasn't
about to be overshadowed, though.
Ramee dished out nine assists for the
game, and his last one, a feed to
Lichti underneath with 7:09 to play,
was the 500 th of his career. Ramee
had already become the Cardinal's
all-time assist leader in his junior
season.
"It was one of my goals to reach
500,"' Ramee said. "1 was just trying
to hold onto the moment."
In addition to Ramee, forwards
Andy Fischer and Neil Johnson were
playing their final game at Maples
Pavilion. Forward Earl Koberlein and
guard Steve Brown were also on
hand, but they were both sidelined
earlier this year with injuries.
"I wanted this game so badly for
the seniors," Davis said. "1 feel that
our seniors laid the foundation of a
solid program. We have established
stability and a winning attitude, and
these seniors deserve all the credit."
And Davis' team seemed to share
his desire to let the seniors go out in
style. The Cardinal worked its fast
break offense to perfection in the first
half to open a 44-28 halftime lead,
then extended the margin in the
second half. Stanford's biggest lead

was a 74-51 advantage that came
with 6:11 left, and from then on it
was just a matter of when to take out
the seniors for their standing ovation.
That came at the 2:51 mark, as
Davis took his time to let each of his
veterans savor their final victory on
the home court.
The victory was Stanford's fifth
straight against the Trojans dating
back to 1984, including sweeps of the

Stanford improved to 8-8 in the
Pac-10, 14-14 overall. The Cardinal
is tied for tifth place with Oregon
State.
"Why have we done so well against
USC?" Davis said. "I feel it is just a
coincidence that we happen to play so

well against them. 1 know they were
hurting without Derrick Dowell. We
played well against them down there,
too."
Davis was referring to the in
definite suspension last week of
Dowell, the Trojans' second leading
scorer, for disciplinary reasons.
Dowell had been averaging 15.5
points and 7.8 rebounds per game,
and he had scored 13 against Stan
ford when the teams first met in Los
Angeles.
"Obviously," USC Coach Stan
Morrison said, "Stanford played with
more emotion than we did. They beat
us in every phase of the game."
At the offensive end, Stanford
opened up its running game as well as
it has all season. "It's a fine line with
our style," Davis said. "It's tough to
learn. We want our players to have
the freedom to run, but still have pa
tience. We have to teach them to play
under control."
"We didn't get back on defense,"
Morrison said. "We were continually
chasing the rebounder down the
court. We would be two steps behind
every time, and when you do that,
you're fighting a losing battle."
Defensively, as usual, the Cardinal

season series the last two seasons.
Stanford improved to 8-8 in the
Pac-10, 14-14 overall. The Cardinal
is tied for tifth place with Oregon
State.
"Why have we done so well against
USC?" Davis said. "I feel it is just a
coincidence that we happen to play so

well against them. 1 know they were
hurting without Derrick Dowell. We
played well against them down there,
too."
Davis was referring to the in
definite suspension last week of
Dowell, the Trojans' second leading
scorer, for disciplinary reasons.
Dowell had been averaging 15.5
points and 7.8 rebounds per game,
and he had scored 13 against Stan
ford when the teams first met in Los
Angeles.
"Obviously," USC Coach Stan
Morrison said, "Stanford played with
more emotion than we did. They beat
us in every phase of the game."
At the offensive end, Stanford
opened up its running game as well as
it has all season. "It's a fine line with
our style," Davis said. "It's tough to
learn. We want our players to have
the freedom to run, but still have pa
tience. We have to teach them to play
under control."
"We didn't get back on defense,"
Morrison said. "We were continually
chasing the rebounder down the
court. We would be two steps behind
every time, and when you do that,
you're fighting a losing battle."
Defensively, as usual, the Cardinal
pressured USC all over the court and
forced 20 turnovers, 12 in the
decisive first half. And on the boards,
the Cardinal held an impressive 37-
22 edge.
Much of that was due to the im
proved play of centers Howard
Wright and Eric Reveno. Both had
been held scoreless in Thursday
night's loss to Oregon State, but they
came back with a vengeance Satur
day. Wright scored 12 points and had
seven rebounds in 24 minutes, and
Reveno had perhaps his best game of
the year with eight points and six
rebounds in 16 minutes.
"Howard Wright," Davis said,
"played a fine game today. He knew
he had made a lot of freshman
mistakes against Oregon State, and I
thought he redeemed himself today.
Howard has a lot of pride, and he
keeps getting better and better."

With 2:51 to play in Saturday's game with USC, Stanford Coach Tom Davis took Andy Fischer and fellow
seniors Keith Ramee and Neil Johnson out of the contest one by one to enable each to hear the cheers of the
Maples Pavilion crowd one last time. While it was the seniors, including the injured Steve Brown and Earl
Koberlein, who got the standing ovations, the whole team deserved applause after routing the Trojans 85-64.
