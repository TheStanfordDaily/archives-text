# Plemel, late DP give Card series

TUCSON, Ariz. — Yesterday's finale to a three
game weekend series between Arizona and Stanford
was strange, even surprising, as third games go.
First, the game — won by Stanford, 7-4 — was
relatively low scoring. Wrapup games in college ball
usually pit a pair of raggedy-armed starters against one
another: batsmen earn their keep each Sunday by pad
ding their averages on fat, juicy pitches. The third
game's when you get your 11-10, 15-8 slugfests.
It was a little different yesterday — together Arizona
and Stanford managed only 16 hits.
But that wasn't the real surprise. Yesterday's rubber
game meant Stanford, the three-time defending cham
pion of the Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division
but also a team that lost plenty of talent to graduation,
took two of three games from Arizona, a club picked
by many to win the pennant.
The Cardinal, now 13-6 overall and 2-1 in Six-Pac
play, won Friday's opener 6-4 before dropping Satur
day's game 8-5. After this weekend, the Wildcats stand
at 14-8 overall. 1-2 in league.
"To be honest, I didn't expect to win the series
here," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"We weren't playing well coming in. and I really
don't think we played too well here. It's the sign of a
great team, to not play well but still win. The team
showed me a lot today."
Yesterday, Wildcat starter Don Snowden issued
three walks and a single to Toi Cook before leaving the
game with none out in the first, trailing 1-0.
First baseman Doug Robbins lashed reliever Jim
McDonald's first offering hard but straight at center
fielder Chuck Johnson. Robbins' sacrifice fly made the
score 2-0.
