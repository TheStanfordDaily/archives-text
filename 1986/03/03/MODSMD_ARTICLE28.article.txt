# Plemel, late DP give Card series
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Yesterday's finale to a three
game weekend series between Arizona and Stanford
was strange, even surprising, as third games go.
First, the game — won by Stanford, 7-4 — was
relatively low scoring. Wrapup games in college ball
usually pit a pair of raggedy-armed starters against one
another: batsmen earn their keep each Sunday by pad
ding their averages on fat, juicy pitches. The third
game's when you get your 11-10, 15-8 slugfests.
It was a little different yesterday — together Arizona
and Stanford managed only 16 hits.
But that wasn't the real surprise. Yesterday's rubber
game meant Stanford, the three-time defending cham
pion of the Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division
but also a team that lost plenty of talent to graduation,
took two of three games from Arizona, a club picked
by many to win the pennant.
The Cardinal, now 13-6 overall and 2-1 in Six-Pac
play, won Friday's opener 6-4 before dropping Satur
day's game 8-5. After this weekend, the Wildcats stand
at 14-8 overall. 1-2 in league.
"To be honest, I didn't expect to win the series
here," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"We weren't playing well coming in. and I really
don't think we played too well here. It's the sign of a
great team, to not play well but still win. The team
showed me a lot today."
Yesterday, Wildcat starter Don Snowden issued
three walks and a single to Toi Cook before leaving the
game with none out in the first, trailing 1-0.

McDonald's first offering hard but straight at center
fielder Chuck Johnson. Robbins' sacrifice fly made the
score 2-0.

Mike Sonne's fifth-inning run was one of five driven in Saturday by Arizona DH Gar
Millay in the Wildcats' 8-5 victory over Stanford.
.The teams traded runs in the
fourth. Stanford's tally came when
Mike Deßenon, who doubled, scored
on Ken Green's flyout to right;
Arizona's shortstop, Dave Rohde,
responded in the bottom half of the
inning with his third home run of the
year.
Cardinal starter Steve Chitren,
staked to a 3-2 advantage, breezed
through the fifth but ran into trouble
in the sixth. "As a pitcher, anytime
you have a lead, you've got to feel
comfortable," Chitren said. "The se
cret is not to let up."
Todd Trafton, the All Six-Pac first
baseman called "Sluggo" by his
teammates, turned the tables on
Chitren and Stanford in a hurry. With
Mike Senne on first after walking to
lead off the bottom of the sixth, Traf
ton reached for a high, outside pitch
and poked it out to left. The blow,
which was helped by a strong wind
that was blowing out throughout the
game, was Trafton's seventh of the
season.

"1 was getting my fastball up occa
sionally," said Chitren, a freshman.
"That was getting me in trouble. 1
was high with a couple of off-speed
pitches, too. But hey, these guys are
much better hitters than anyone I've
ever faced before."
Marquess, his team down for the
first time all day, went immediately to
his bullpen. Lee Plemel, a sophomore
right-hander, was given the task of
keeping Stanford in the game.
With runners on second and third
and one out, Stanford's braintrust
decided to intentionally walk
Arizona's No. 8 hitter, Chuck Long,
who was 0-for-2 on the day. The
move brought catcher David Taylor,
who had singled earlier, to the plate
with the bases loaded.
Plemel's 1-1 delivery to Taylor, a
slow man, was probably the after
noon's biggest pitch. "1 was trying to
pitch him away," Plemel explained.
"Their hitters have a tendency to pull
those balls, to roll over them and hit a
ground balls."
Taylor bounced Plemel's fastball
over the pitcher's mound to Ken
Green near the second-base bag.
Green routinely stepped on the base,
then threw to first for the inning

ending double play.
A pair of costly errors by Tommy
Hinzo, the Wildcat second ba.seman,
led to two Stanford runs in the
seventh. With one out, Frank Carey,
2-for-3 yesterday, grounded a single
past Trafton and moved to second on
pitcher Gary Alexander's balk.
Hinzo misplayed Walt Harris'
routine ground ball to put runners on
first and third. Cook then slashed a
single to right to drive in the tying
run.
Harris, at second after Cook's base
hit, came across with the go-ahead
run when Mark Davis' two-hop
grounder deflected off Hinzo's leg
and into center field.
Stanford added an insurance run in
the eighth — on Doug Robbins'
second home run of the year — and
another in the ninth.
Plemel, who replaced Chitren in
the sixth, blanked Arizona through
his four innings of work to record the
win, his first against no losses.
In winning yesterday's rubber
game, the Cardinal bounced back
from Saturday's 8-5 defeat.
Gilber Heredia, 4-1, shackled
Stanford through eight innings, and
Gar Mill ay, the designated hitter.

drove in five ruas on three hits to lift
Arizona to its lone weekend win.
After setting down the first two
Arizona batters in the bottom of the
first, Stanford's starter and loser, Rob
Wassenaar, weakened.
Senne doubled to the gap in right
center. Then third baseman Mark
Machtolf, after bobbling Trafton's
two-hop bouncer, threw low to first.
Machtolfs error left runners on first
and second and brought up Millay,
who entered the game hitting .263
with one home run.
Millay jerked Wassenaar's 1-1
delivery, a curveball, over the left
field fence for a three-run home run.
"In that first inning, Wassenaar was
throwing a lot of junk, plenty of chan
geups. 1 was looking for anything
offspeed," Millay said.
Arizona added a run in the fourth,
then finished Wassenaar, 2-1, with
two more in the fifth. Millay scored
the fourth-inning run after doubling
and drove in both runs in the fifth
with a two-out line-drive single to
right.
Before leaving with one out in the
ninth, Heredia induced 11 ground
ball outs. Three double plays also
aborted budding Stanford rallies.

Heredia was in command until the
top of the ninth. An error and a single
put runners on first and second.
Freshman Ed Sprague then drove a
Heredia pitch out to left for a three
run home run. After Green singled.
Wildcat Coach Jerry Kindall was
forced to pull his starter.
"He (Heredia) is a real battler,"
Kindall said. "1 would have liked to
let him go all the way. , . but he was
losing it out there fast."
Left-hander Joe Estes came in to
get two quick outs, fanning Carey and
popping Harris up to right, to record
his second save.
In Friday s series opener, which
was the Six-Pac inauguration for both
teams, Stanford's Jack McDowell, 5-
1, scattered 12 hits in pitching his
third complete game of the year.
The sophomore right-hander
pitched in and out of trouble all after
noon, retiring the Wildcats in order
only twice.
"We had our chances against him,
but he just pitched through it," Kin
dall said. "He was on when he had to
be."
In the Arizona fourth, with Stan
ford on top 4-0 after a four-run
second-inning outburst that drove

Wildcat starter and loser David Car
ley (2-1) from the mound, back-to
back base hits put runners on second
and third. McDowell wiggled out of
the mess by getting Trafton to pop to
right and striking out Millay.
In the bottom of the seventh,
McDowell stranded runners on
second and third: in the eighth,
Arizona left runners on first and
second.
"I was throwing strikes today, get
ting ahead of the hitters," said
McDowell, who struck out nine and
did not walk a batter.
McDowell beat Arizona twice last
year, including a 9-2 College World
Series win that eliminated the
Wildcats. But he also had his rough
est outing here at Sancet Field,
giving up five runs in just over two in
nings, while suffering one of his four
losses.
"This game was big for me,"
McDowell said. "I guess I had some
thing to prove to these guys."

University at 2:30 today at Sunken
Diamond. Kevin Kunkel, who stayed
at Stanford this weekend with a
stomach vims, is the Cardinal's likely
starter.
