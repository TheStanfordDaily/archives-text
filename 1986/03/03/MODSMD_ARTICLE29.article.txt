# Women dominate at Pac-West swim
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
If there were any doubts about
whether Stanford is the best
women's swimming team in the
Pacific West Conference, they were
erased over the weekend.
The Cardinal overwhelmed the
competition Thursday through Satur
day at the Pac-West Women's Swim
ming and Diving Championships, as it
totaled 922 points, outscoring second
place UCLA by a hefty 248-point
margin.
"Our effort was tremendous,"
senior Lisa Hazen said. "We really
got behind each other."
During the three-day meet at East
Los Angeles College, Stanford won
14 of 20 events and qualified for the
NCAAs in nine new races. ~
The Cardinal was again led by
senior Kathy Smith and freshman
Jenna Johnson. They accounted for
or were part of 10 Stanford victories.
Smith took first in the 100-yard
breaststroke, 200 breaststroke and
200 individual medley. In the 200
breaststroke, Smith beat Olympian
teammate Susan Rapp en route to her
fastest time this year. 2:16.79.
Johnson swept the freestyle events,
winning the 50, 100 and 200. She also
finished first in the 100 butterfly.
Smith and Johnson both participated
in the winning 200 freestyle relay,
400 freestyle relay and 400 medley
relay.

Many other Cardinal swimmers
stood out over the weekend.
"We had different people improve
in this meet," Stanford Coach George
Haines said. "We try to improve
somewhere in each meet this year."
Sophomore Stacey Shupe was vic
torious in the 1,650 freestyle event.
She finished in a blazing 16:18.94.
Shupe also came in second in the 500
freestyle.
Hazen, in her final conference
meet, won the 500 freestyle
(4:48.53), finished third in the 1,650
freestyle (16:29.72) and fifth in the
200 freestyle (1:51.99). All three
times were personal bests, and she
qualified for the NCAAs in the 500
freestyle.
"It was nice to come out winning,
seeing as how we lost last year,"
Hazen said.
"Lisa Hazen had the best swim
ming meet of her life," Haines
said."That was an added plus. 1 think
she'll have a great NCAAs."
The Stanford divers had a difficult
meet, with no finishes in the top
three. In the one-meter dive, Kim
Jones had the highest Cardinal point
total, 395.2, and finished in fifth
place.
With only the Stanford Invitational
meet left before the NCAA Cham
pionships, the Cardinal is in top form.
It is currently ranked No. 3 nationally
and has a 7-0 dual-meet record. Stan
ford will enter the NCAAs as one of
the favorites to win it all.
