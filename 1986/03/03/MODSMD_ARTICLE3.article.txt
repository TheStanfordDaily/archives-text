### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
In honor of the men and women of the
armed forces of the United States who served
in the Vietnam War. The names of those who
gave their lives and of those who remain mis
sing are inscribed in the order they were
taken from as. — Introductory statement on
the east-center panel of the Vietnam Veter
ans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
As John Devitt pulled his truck up to the
field between Wilbur and Stern Halls yester
day morning, he was greeted by about a
half-dozen other Vietnam veterans who
were there to unload the 148 black
plexiglass and wood panels.
Two haul* later, their.work was complete

and the half-scale replica of the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. —
standing six feet tall — stretched 250 feet
across the grassy field.
The "Moving Wall," silkscreened with the
names of 58.022 U.S. military personnel
who were killed or listed as missing in action
in the controversial war. will rest on the field
through Sunday.
Devitt, a door gunner during the war and
one of the wall's three creators, stood back
against the truck as students and people
from the community searched the wall for
names of friends and relatives killed in the
war.
"I knew I couldn't make it back to Wash
ington, and I wanted my children to see it,"
said Julio Burdin of San a

copy of her high school yearbook, Burdin
searched for the names of those she went to
school with in Cleveland, Ohio.
Larry Medina of Redwood City, who
served in the U.S. Air Force from 1966 to
1970, also searched the memorial for the
names of high school classmates.
After finding the name of Kenneth Claire
— a classmate who apparently drowned
crossing a river, unable to free himself from
the 40-pound pack on his back — Medina
expressed concern about the war.
"The funny thing about it was it was so
natural. Nobody even questioned it for a
long time," Medina said.

and Stern halls. The wall, which will be guarded 24 hours a day, will remain until Sunday.
wearing black T-shirts commemorating the wall's
stop at the University, helped visitors locate names
by lining two books that contain an alphabetized lis
ting of those appearing on the wall's two wings.
The names, ordered according to the date a per
son was reported as either killed or missing in ac
tion, begin with 1959 at the top of the eastern panel
at the center of the memorial. The final names,
dating 1975, appear at the bottom of the panel on
the western wing at the center of the wall.
Volunteers from Branner and other freshmen

dormitories will take shifts guarding the wall 24
hours a day and helping visitors find names.
Dave Hoffman, a Branner RA who along with
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jackson first
proposed bringing the wall to the University, said
the impact of the wall was greater than he an
ticipated.
"1 don't think you can possibly expect something
like this. You can't accurately imagine what 250
feet of 58,000 names is going to look like. . . . I'm
very pleased," Hoffman said.
Hoffman, however, expressed some concern
about the proximity to the wall of sunbathers.
"I don't like it. You know, in a sense it really
divides the people who are on the wall, who are the

same age as the people sunbathing, " he said.
But despite the irony that Hoffman sensed, the
wall has had a great impact on those who come to
see it and put down their comments in a book at the
volunteer table.
A documentary about the wall's stop at the Uni
versity is being made by Vinnie Folitan and An
thony Villalobos. both juniors and majors in the
Department of Communication. The two. who are
not receiving academic credit for their work, said
they are filming the wall out of "good will and our
interest in video."
The documentary will also compare the com
