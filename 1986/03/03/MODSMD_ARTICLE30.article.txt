### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Under the beating sun at DeGuerre Pool Saturday af
ternoon, records melted and fans cheered as the Stanford
men's swim team defeated rival California 75-47 in the
Big Splash.
In the final dual meet of the 1985-86 swim season,
seniors Dave Lundberg, Thor Johnson, Tom Rothenbuc
her and senior co-captains Mike Reynolds and John Mof
fet went out with a bang, capturing their 45th consecutive
victory in their four years of Stanford swimming and
diving.
Cal Coach Nort Thorten's main disappointment was
"the fact that we were looking to score at least 50 points
today, and we came up short. We didn't have our best
relays here, so we were hoping to squeeze out a few points
somewhere else."
But no such luck. Stanford swam tough — tough
enough to shatter a few pool records and post some
NCAA-qualifying marks in the process.
Moffet proved that good things happen in pairs when he
set DeGuerre records in the 200-yard breaststroke
(2:01.09) and the 100 breaststroke (54.98) and hit
NCAA-qualifying cuts in both events. "It's kind of weird
knowing its all over (the dual meet season). Moffet said.

i>uw iit tiniy on my training and taper through to
NCAAs."
In the 200 butterfly, junior Pablo Morales tied the na
tion's best time this year — set by teammate Anthony
Mosse — with a 1:46.08 elocking. In the process, he
squashed the old DeGuerre record. Morales also qualified
for the NCAAs in the 100 butterfly with a time of 48.19.
The Bears' world record-holder. Matt Biondi, did not
swim characteristically Saturday, placing second in both
the 200 and 50 freestyles. But as Thorton said, "His main
goal for this weekend was to get his 200 free time down
and make cuts for NCAAs. and he got what he came for."
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney was pleasantly surprised
with freshman Kurt Kroesche's performance in the 200
backstroke. He won with a time of 1:52.37. "Kurt knew
that Sean (Murphy) was going to be gone, and he really
did the job." Kenney said.
Murphy, a sophomore, was in Canada swimming in the
World Trials. "I was looking forward to swimming that
race," Kroesche said. "I went out pretty slow and picked
it up at the end. I hope to qualify for NCAAs."
The men's diving team had competed against the Bears
the previous weekend, but it counted toward Saturday's
meet. Johnson and Rothenbucher placed first and second
in both the one-meter and three-meter dives.
"They did great once again. It's nice to be able to count
on these guys." Kenney said of the divers.

during Moffet's career. His co-celebrators are, from left to right: Dave Lederman, Dan Muth, Mike Meyer,
