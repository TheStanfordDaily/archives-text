# Women hoopsters break streak at Devils' expense
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
Saturday night, amid a flurry of hugs, high tens and a
whole bunch of hooting and hollering around the Stan
ford bench, reserve guard Leslie Lorimer turned
toward a friend in the stands, and, with a strain of
mock-seriousness traced across her face, mouthed the
phrase, "It's about time."
Lorimer's sentiment was poignant for many of the
100 loyal Cardinal supporters in attendance at Maples
Pavilion, but it was especially so for the members of
the Stanford women's basketball team who finally put
the brakes on a nagging nine-game losing skid.
The 75-69 upset, which came at the expense of con
ference foe Arizona State (14-10), featured some
unlikely heroes.
Freshmen guard-forwards Jeanne Osmera and
Andrea Ransom, who have mostly been members of
the supporting cast this season, had to step into the
leading roles vacated by injured starters Jill Yanke and
Evon Asforis. During the crucial second half, the two
reserves helped the Cardinal (12-14) maintain the
five-point lead it had built by halftime.
Osmera pulled down crucial rebounds, while Ran
som offered some offensive punch from the outside,
sinking five shots in the latter stanza. She finished the
game converting seven of 10 attempts from the field
for a total of 14 points.
Led by Ransom and senior Virginia Sourlis, who put
on a prodigious shooting exhibition in the second half,
Stanford shot extremely well from the outside.

"I think they were just waiting on their screens bet
ter," Stanford Asst. Coach Julie Plank said. "They
spread the offense out better and were more patient.'
Sourlis was successful on her first six long-range
bombs in the second half. Scoring a season-high 25
points, she became Stanford's second all-time leading
scorer with 1,419 points, passing Louise Smith (1978-
82) who amassed 1,414 points during her career.
The win over the Sun Devils was Stanford's first
against a Pac-West Conference opponent. The Card
inal is now 1-6 with one more league matchup remain
ing.
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said the victory,
the Cardinal's first since it beat St. Mary's 72-71 over a
month ago, lifted a great deal of weight off her team's
shoulders.
"They were under a lot of pressure to win a game,"
she said. "Now that they're more relaxed, 1 think
they'll play even better."
The Cardinal will have to play better if it hopes to
challenge U.S. International University (21-5) tonight
in Maples.
The Lady Gulls feature a highly explosive attack led
by 6-foot-1 senior Toya DeCree, who is averaging 20
points a game this season.
"They love to run, and they love to play offense,"
Plank said. "They execute the fast break really well."
USIU is a Division I school that competes in the
West Coast Athletic Conference. The Lady Gulls have
won 13 consecutive games heading into tonight's game
against the Cardinal.
