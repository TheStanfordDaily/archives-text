### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Playing solidly for the first time in
three 19X6 tournaments, the Stanford
women's golf team finished fifth in
the Patty Sheehan Invitational, which
concluded yesterday at Fort Ord in
Monterey.
The Cardinal shot 3 16 as a team in
the third round to end up at 944 for
the tourney, retaining its filth-place
position while the standings juggled
around it.
San Jose State, with a total of 929,
rose from second place to capture the
tournament by four strokes over top
ranked Tulsa.
UCLA, the leader after two

rounds, shot 3 15 as a team yesterday
to fall to fourth with a total of 935,
one swing behind cross-town rival
use.
Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy had
a good shot at winning among indi
viduals, having been tied for third
through Saturday's play with UCLA's
Kiystal Parker, two shots out of the
lead.
But as the first and second-place
players, USC's Kim Cathrein and
UCLA's Kay Cockrell, faltered,
Parker shot a 75 to McCarthy's 76 on
the par-74, 6,051-yard Bayonet Golf
Course to grab the title with a score
of 226. McCarthy ended up in a tie
for second with SJSU's Lisa Ipken
danz, who fired a 73 yesterday to leap

from the seventh-place spot on the
leader board.
Cathrein's third-round 80 left her
in fourth place at 229, followed by
Oklahoma State's Robin Hood and
U.S. International University's
Laurette Maritz at 230.
Kay Cornelius was second among
the Cardinal golfers at 235, followed
by a newcomer to the starting five,
Adrienne Gilmartin, who fired a 77
yesterday to end up at 242.
Julie Carmichael had rounds of 82,
81 and 83 to conclude the invite at
246, while Trish McGonigle, who
started off strongly with a 79 Friday,
shot an 88 in the third round to finish
at 248.
