# Netters trounce Bruins
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In what could only be described as perfect weather, the
Stanford women's tennis team played near-flawless tennis
Friday afternoon, defeating a helpless UCLA team 8-1.
The No. 2 Cardinal remained undefeated, raising its
record to 6-0, while the visiting Bruins, No. 9 nationally,
dropped out of the unbeaten ranks, falling to 5-1.
"That's great, really good," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said after the match. "It was a perfect day."
Collegiate women's tennis hits been characterized by
parity this season, but the Cardinal showed that it has the
ability to dominate when it gets strong performances
across the board.
"If everything goes right, you can do this type of thing,"
Brennan said.
Stanford's Eleni Rossides began the onslaught by
dominating a visibly frustrated Jennifer Fuchs in the No. 2
singles match 6-1, 6-4. The victory was a complete turn
around for the talented freshman, who had lost to San
Diego State's Cindy MacGregor 6-1, 6-4 the previous day
in her first home dual match.
"I was concentrating a lot better today," Rossides said.
"I started off slowly yesterday. It's just easier when you
start off well. You get more confidence."
Rossides has played internationally as a junior, but she

indicated that collegiate tennis carries more pressure.
Still, she has enjoyed the change so far. "It's a lot of fun,'
she said. "You know the team's always out there. There's
eight to 10 people with you."
UCLA's lone win came in the No. 6 singles match,
where Allyson Cooper defeated the Cardinal's AlyGe
Werdel 6-2, 6-2. Cooper's victory momentarily tied the
match at 1-1.
The resurgent play of Stanford's Patty Fendick ag
gravated UCLA's Jane Thomas throughout their No. |1
singles match. Fendick, ranked No. 4 in singles, fought off
3-0 and 3-1 deficits in several games in the first set to win
6-3.
"It took me a little bit to get going and get into high
gear," she said.
Fendick captured the second set 6-4 amidst Thomas'
occasional outbursts, which included high-pitch screams
and slamming balls into the fence. "She was actually good
today," Fendick said.
Junior Stephanie Savides won her third straight singles
match, knocking off the Bruins' Maria LaFranchi 7-5, 6 : 2
in the No. 4 singles to give the Cardinal a 3-1 match ad
vantage.
Savides trailed 5-4 in the first set before winning the
final three games. "She's playing so much tougher now,''

Although Stanford had clinched Friday's match against UCLA after the six singles matches, Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Patty Fendick hammered out a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Jennifer Fuchs and Jane Thomas in the
No. 1 doubles match. Eldredge also beat Joni Urban in singles 6-2, 7-6 and has yet to lose a dual-singles
match this year.
Brennan said.
Tough describes junior Leigh Anne
Eldredge's play lately. On Friday,
Eldredge remained undefeated in
dual match play this season by
beating UCLA's Joni Urban in the
No. 3 singles 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). Urban
was No. 13 in the preseason singles
rankings.
With the team score 4-1, attention
focused on the remaining singles
match between Stanford s Kay Tittle
and UCLA's Catherine O'Meara.
After losing the first set 6-1, Tittle
came back to edge O'Meara in the
second and third sets by identical 6-4
scores to clinch the victory for the
Cardinal.
"She played really well those
second two sets," Brennan said of
Tittle. "She's a fighter.
"To push them out 5-1 in the
singles is great," Brennan added.

start off well. You get more confidence."
Rossides has played internationally as a junior, but she

indicated that collegiate tennis carries more pressure.
Still, she has enjoyed the change so far. "It's a lot of fun,'
she said. "You know the team's always out there. There's
eight to 10 people with you."
UCLA's lone win came in the No. 6 singles match,
where Allyson Cooper defeated the Cardinal's AlyGe
Werdel 6-2, 6-2. Cooper's victory momentarily tied the
match at 1-1.
The resurgent play of Stanford's Patty Fendick ag
gravated UCLA's Jane Thomas throughout their No. |1
singles match. Fendick, ranked No. 4 in singles, fought off
3-0 and 3-1 deficits in several games in the first set to win
6-3.
"It took me a little bit to get going and get into high
gear," she said.
Fendick captured the second set 6-4 amidst Thomas'
occasional outbursts, which included high-pitch screams
and slamming balls into the fence. "She was actually good
today," Fendick said.
Junior Stephanie Savides won her third straight singles
match, knocking off the Bruins' Maria LaFranchi 7-5, 6 : 2
in the No. 4 singles to give the Cardinal a 3-1 match ad
vantage.
Savides trailed 5-4 in the first set before winning the
final three games. "She's playing so much tougher now,''

Although Stanford had clinched Friday's match against UCLA after the six singles matches, Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Patty Fendick hammered out a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Jennifer Fuchs and Jane Thomas in the
No. 1 doubles match. Eldredge also beat Joni Urban in singles 6-2, 7-6 and has yet to lose a dual-singles
match this year.
Brennan said.
Tough describes junior Leigh Anne
Eldredge's play lately. On Friday,
Eldredge remained undefeated in
dual match play this season by
beating UCLA's Joni Urban in the
No. 3 singles 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). Urban
was No. 13 in the preseason singles
rankings.
With the team score 4-1, attention
focused on the remaining singles
match between Stanford s Kay Tittle
and UCLA's Catherine O'Meara.
After losing the first set 6-1, Tittle
came back to edge O'Meara in the
second and third sets by identical 6-4
scores to clinch the victory for the
Cardinal.
"She played really well those
second two sets," Brennan said of
Tittle. "She's a fighter.
"To push them out 5-1 in the
singles is great," Brennan added.
Though the singles results took the
drama out of the doubles, the Card
inal played as if the match was on the
line, taking all three matches in
straight sets.
