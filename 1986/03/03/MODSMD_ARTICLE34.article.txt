three days of play.
According to Gould, even that lone loss to Pawsat and Leach could have
been a victory.
"(Goldie and Grabb) had a good chance in the (first set) tie-breaker,"
Gould said after the match. "Jim was serving at 5-4, but he missed a backhand
volley, and then Dan missed a backhand volley on the next point. Then Leach
served an ace."
