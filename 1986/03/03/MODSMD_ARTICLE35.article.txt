# Gymnasts continue to progress
## Questionable judging masks strong women's performance 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
The first annual Hobee's Invitational women's
gymnastics tournament Friday pight in Maples
Pavilion was a meet marked by peaks and lows —
peak performances but low scores.
After a tough three-way race for first place in
the tournament, No. 2-ranked Georgia came out
on top with a score of 180.6. California was
second at 179.8. Stanford was third with 178.05
and Michigan a distant fourth with a 167.95 team
score.
"All of the coaches agree that the officiating
was less than adequate," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina said. "I'm dumbfounded — we hit well
enough to go 182, but the judges didn't score

us."
Sophomore gymnast Alison McGann shared
Sardina's sentiments."We did much better as a
team," she said. "The score doesn't reflect the
performance."
California Coach Pam Burgess agreed. "The
scoring was low," she said.
The low scoring, however, didn't affect the
quality of the performances. "We actually had a
pretty good meet," Sardina said. "We did a good
job tonight."
Freshman Jinny Rhee had a very good meet.
She led Stanford in every event and garnered a
36.50 total score and second place in the all
around. "Jinny did a good job for us," Sardina
said.
Rhee was very positive about the meet and her

performance. "I'm very glad," she said.
However, the Cardinal didn't have the
monopoly on great performances Friday night.
Both Georgia and California had fine efforts as
well.
Perhaps the finest single performance came
from Georgia's Lucy Werner on the uneven par
allel bars. Rated No. I in the nation on bars,
Werner had an electrifying routine which earned
her a 9.55.
Her teammate Gina Banales also had a great
evening, coming in third in the all-around.
Cal, too, had its share of excellent competitors,
but none surpassed Karin Iyemura. The fresh
man Iyemura, ranked seventh nationally in all
around, led Cal throughout the meet and came in
first in the all-around Friday.
