# No. 2 men triumph in 'practice' meet against UC-Davis

When you perform under the
pressure of being one of the top
men's gymnastics teams in the
country, with your ranking always in
jeopardy, it is nice to have a
weekend off from competition once
in a while.
While the No. 2-ranked Cardinal
did compete this weekend, the com
petition was such that the club could
take it easy. Stanford did just that

and still managed to come away
with a 269.25 to 249.85 win over
UC-Davis to up its dual record to
15-2.
According to freshman Andy
Ropp, the meet gave Stanford the
chance "to keep up with (its)
routines and give a few guys some
experience.
"It was," Ropp said, "really like a
practice."
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada
was looking for specific improve
ments from specific gymnasts Satur

day night. "I gave the guys some in
dividual assignments after the
Hobee's Invitational (Feb. 23) and
asked them to work on them during
the week," he said.
Hamada did see the result of
some of this work. He was espe
cially pleased with the squad's per
formance on the parallel bars,
where, Hamada said, Stanford
"really showed improvement. It
used to be our worst event besides
the pommel horse, but now it's get
ting pretty good."

Overall, the Cardinal gymnasts
recorded eight personal bests, in
cluding a 9.5 from Gary Smith on
the parallel bars and a 9.6 from
Mike Matzek on the high bar.
Scott Schaffer and co-captain
Mark Arnold both set personal-best
all-around scores. Arnold's 52.4
was 1.45 points higher than his pre
vious best, and it was a signal that
he is well on the road to recovery
from a muscle strain in his shoulder
which has been bothering him for
some time.
