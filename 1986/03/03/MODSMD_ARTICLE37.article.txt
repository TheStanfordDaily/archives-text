In its final team effort, the Stanford men s
varsity fencing squad triumphed in the NCAA
Western Regional Championships, taking first
overall in a whirlwind of victories.
Foothill College was the site for this
weekend's tournament, as the Cardinal
trounced the six top men's teams in the region:
Fullerton State, the University of San Francisco,
Long Beach State, the University of San Diego,
UC-Santa Cruz and Air Force.
The Stanford men left their competition
gasping for breath in the wake of overwhelming
wins, crushing San Francisco 24-3 and Fullerton
21-6. Santa Cruz fell 19-8, but San Diego and
Long Beach gave the men a scare before the
sabre team brought the Cardinal back to 14-13
victories.
Tension was in the air, as the Cardinal faced
their Western Regional rivals of the past four
years, Air Force, in the final bout of the tourna
ment. The Stanford men shot down the Falcons
18-9, ending Air Force's three-year tournament

winning streak.
"It feels sweet to beat Air Force," epeeist
Vince Bradshaw said. "We trounced them in
every weapon."
"It was an outstanding team effort," Stanford
Coach Buzz Hurst said, "Everybody came
through."
Air Force Coach Wendell Kubik was im
pressed with the match. "Stanford is providing a
lot in the level of improvement in the West.
They've really slipped in as the West Coast col
legiate power in fencing."
Said Air Force Asst. Coach Erv Scheets,
"We got off to a slow start and couldn't recover.
Anyway, next year Stanford is toast."
"The one set of muscles you don't use to win
fencing bouts is your jaw muscles," Hurst said
in reply. "We prefer to do our talking with our
swords."
As a result of the strength of their overall
standings as well as their performance at the
Westerns, Stanford fencers Andy Goorno, El
liott Cheu, Steve Levitan, Dave Finkelstein and
Larry Murk will be sent to represent the Card
inal in the NCAA Nationals in Princeton, N.J.
