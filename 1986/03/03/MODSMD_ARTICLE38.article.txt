# Stanford promising at San Jose Relays
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Last Saturday, while most of the Stanford
sports community was indoors watching the
basketball team's home finale, the track
squad was beginning its outdoor season. The
meet was the San Jose State Relays, and
though it didn't count for a whole lot, it was a
good chance for the Cardinal athletes and
coaches to see where the team is at.
It's still a bit early to tell for sure, but
judging from Saturday's performances, the
Cardinal could be shaping up for a promising
season.
The highlight of the meet came in the
women's weight events. Led by senior Pam
Dukes, the women swept the discus and
placed first and second in the shot put.
Dukes won the shot put with a personal
best of 54 feet, 4-3/4 inches and grabbed

second in the discus with another personal
best, 163-10.
The discus was won by Stanford's Karen
Nickerson, whose throw of 181-2 was only
two inches off her all-time best.
Two victories in the distance races and two
third places in the sprints highlighted the
men's meet.
Christian Skoog, James Browne, Steve
Schadler and Jeff Atkinson combined for
first in the distance medley, and then Schad
ler, Skoog and Atkinson joined with Dave
Rees to win the two-mile relay.
The Cardinal 400-meter and 1,600-meter
relay teams both grabbed third. Glenn
Schneider placed second in the discus, as did
Jay Thorson in the 110-meter hurdles. Thor
son, who was only one-tenth of a second
short of qualifying for the NCAAs in his first
indoor meet, could be someone to watch as
the season progresses.
