Brazil may refinance foreign debt
WASHINGTON — Brazil, Latin America's biggest debtor, reached
agreement with a crucial commercial bank committee yesterday on a
$31 billion refinancing package that significantly lowers the level of in
terest rates it must pay.
The agreement follows Brazil's announcement Friday of a far
reaching program designed to reduce inflation, which in recent months
reached a rate of 400 percent a year. It also comes amid growing
demands by Latin American governments for interest rate concessions
to enable them to meet payments on the region's $370 billion debt.
The agreement refinances $6 billion in debt that matured in 1985 and
$9.5 billion that matures in 1986 and provides about $15.5 billion of
trade and other financing. The bankers agreed to lower the interest rate
on the $15.5 billion of maturing debt by nearly one percentage point,
which will save Brazil about $ 150 million a year, officials said.
Brazil, which had pressed its creditors to lower their interest rate
spreads, or markups, during the month-long negotiations, was given the
more favorable financing terms by the 14-bank advisory committee as a
reward for managing its finances better, the committee said.
The agreement with Brazil was seen by bankers yesterday as an en
dorsement of the way the creditors are handling the debt problem.
It also serves as an example for other financially strapped countries at
a time of growing tension between lenders and debtor nations demand
ing lower interest rates, particularly for countries hurt by plunging oil
prices, bankers said.
Brazil had trade surpluses of $13.1 billion in 1984 and $ 12.45 billion
in 1985, according to the bank committee. Brazil also has raised $9 bil
lion in its foreign cash reserves since the end of 1983, when the account
was in the red.
The proposal will go to the 700 international creditor banks involved
with Brazil's debt for their approval. An agreement is expected to be
signed by June, Rhodes said.
Summit to be held despite arms rift
MOSCOW — The Soviet-American summit will be held this year
regardless of whether progress is made on arms control issues, the editor
of Pravda said yesterday.
The date of the second meeting between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev and President Reagan, however, will be linked to the chances for
accord on either a nuclear test ban or removal of intermediate-range
missiles from Europe, Victor Afanasiev, editor of the Communist Party
newspaper said.
His remarks to reporters tended to squelch doubts about whether
Gorbachev would come to the United States in 1986 to meet Reagan, as
they agreed at the first summit in Geneva.
In a speech opening the 27th Communist Party Congress last Tuesday,
Gorbachev hinted that failure to reach agreement on the two arms con
trol issues might delay the top-level conference.
Asked to clarify Gorbachev's statement. Afanasiev said that the
Kremlin chief was not trying to lay down conditions for a second meeting
with Reagan.
But, the editor added. Gorbachev believes it is time to shift "from
mere conversations to concrete deeds" since a second get-together just
for friendly greetings did not make a lot of sense.
On the issue of medium-range missiles, Afanasiev said, "Positions are
more or less close.. . . There are some glimpses of hope here."
He added that Reagan is under great public pressure to agree to a
total ban on nuclear testing, despite the administration's opposition to
such a step.
"There was agreement reached in Geneva that the next (summit)
meeting is to take place this year," Afanasiev said. "This is still valid.
The question is only about the timing. ... If the Americans were to go
their half of the way on these two issues, or even on one of them, the
timing would be solved automatically as Gorbachev has said himself."
Church's role in Poland negotiated
WARSAW, Poland — Alter a long period of tense relations, the gov
ernment of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and the Roman Catholic Church
are actively negotiating a range of issues that could shape the church's
role in Poland for years to come, church and government officials here
say.
The subjects of discussion include the number of new Catholic
churches that will be authorized for construction in the next five years,
the treatment of opposition activists, a new visit by Pope John Paul II to
his homeland and a proposed church aid program for private agi iculture.
Officials say talks on all these issues have gained momentum in recent
weeks, and several arc likely to be resolved soon.
For Jaruzelski's government, the move to advance church-state rela
tions forms part of a larger strategy to normalize" Poland's internal po
litical situation and improve relations with western countries in the face
of a coming Communist Party congress and mounting economic prob
lems.
In pursuit of internal party support, authorities have signaled a strat
egy of rolling back some of the church's substantial gains in privileges
and political influence since the early 1980s, while avoiding a potentially
debilitating church-state confrontation.
At the same time. Jaruzelski appears eager to create at least the ap
pearance of progress ori those%hurch-related issues that have been cited
by western governments as crucial to the renewal of economic aid to
Poland. First among these is the church s longstanding request to estab
lish a foundation for helping Poland's millions of private farmers.
The outcome of these delicately balanced initiatives could have a
decisive impact on the future of church-state relations under Jaruzelski's
government, church and government sources said. While few observers
predict a major improvement in the ties, a failure to find formulas for
agreement could undermine seriously Jaruzelski's normalization strat
egy.
Iran denounces chemical warfare
TEHRAN. Iran — Iran said yesterday that Iraqi forces were bom
barding the northern border town of Baneh with chemical weapons,
"injuring a large number of people so far."
The official Iranian news agency Irna said the Iraqis had unleashed
chemical salvoes at the town four times since yesterday morning. No im
mediate estimates of casualties were given.
Iran informed the United Nations last week that it would "respond
decisively" to alleged Iraqi air attacks that killed or wounded 48 civilians
at Baneh, 12 miles from the border in the vicinity of the Chuwarta
region invaded by Iran a few days ago.
The threatened eruption of chemical warfare in the gulf coincided
with a flareup of the tanker war that has damaged five vessels since last
Monday and killed three crewmen.
Meanwhile, an Iranian helicopter attacked an empty Turkish tanker in
the central Persian Gulf yesterday morning, killing the chief engineer
and causing extensive damage aboard the 142.000-ton vessel.
Shipping sources said the ship. Atlas I. was sailing on its own power to
the gulf port of Dubai for repairs after a wounded crewman was
evacuated by Qatar air force helicopters.
The rocket attack took place about 80 miles northeast of Qatar, in the
same area where Iranian aircraft have launched a series of raids over the
past few weeks against ships operating on the Arab side of the gulf.
T he raid was evidently in retaliation for a spate of Iraqi attacks since
last Monday that damaged at least four tankers working on Iran's north
south shuttle service.
The newest flareup in the tanker war carried ominous implications for
the non-combatant oil-producing Arab countries of the gulf, whose
foreign ministers were meeting behind closed doors in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, to draft joint precautionary measures against mounting Iranian
threats,to their petroleum exports.
