# IAC to be restructured
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
In a controversial move aimed at bringing more aca
demic strength to three extra-departmental academic pro
grams, the administrative staff of the Innovative Aca
demic Courses (lAC) office will he restructured before
the end of the school year.
The lAC staff, which administers the Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI), the
Undergraduate Special Courses (UGS) and the
Freshman-Sophomore Seminars, currently consists of a
faculty director, a professional co-director, a student co
director, a program coordinator and a program assistant.
The proposed restructuring, engineered by Assoc. Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Carolyn Lougee and current
lAC Faculty Director Jack Winkler, reportedly calls for
the hiring of administrators with stronger academic back
grounds, specifically doctorate level education.
According to Lougee, the reorganization is a product of
"a significant rethinking" about lAC spurred primarily by
the Arrow Report. That report, released in the late sum
mer of 1984, was the work of a commission led by Eco
nomics Prof. -Kenneth Arrow, and it reviewed five extra
departmental programs, including SWOPSI and UGS.
The report lauded the SWOPSI program and its staff, but
raised concerns that SWOPSI and UGS courses "were not
as rigorous and demanding academically" as other Stan
ford course offerings.
I he initial response to the report was the joining of
SWOPSI, UGS and the Freshman and Sophomore Semi
nar program in the fall under the umbrella lAC. headed
by Winkler, a classics professor. At the same time, the
Student Center for Innovative Research and Education
(SCIRE) and the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) were dismantled.
Lougee pointed to three goals in the newly planned
restructuring of the I AC staff: strengthening the academic
profile of the programs, maintaining closeness to students
and making the programs under lAC a more important
part of the undergraduate program at Stanford.
"We want these courses to play a more important role
because the need for critical evaluation of politics and so
cial issues is very great today," Lougee said. "They (the
programs) had become on the periphery of student inter
est and the periphery of institutional concern, and they
are not as strong as they should be academically or in the
servicing of student needs."
The current lAC staffers, however, do not think the
change bodes well for SWOPSI and the other academic
programs. Kerry Atha, the program assistant for
I AC until she resigned last week, said the staff
shuffle will endanger the vitality and novelty of the
program, specifically by cutting student and com
munity input.
"Student input on the level of course develop
ment is being completely eliminated," said Atha.
"And the program is losing 10 years worth of com
munity ties (in the persons of staffers Andre Bur
nett and Barabara Gurin-Reid). There's no way to
replace that with some random Ph. D.s."
Betsy Jelliffe, the I AC student coordinator, is

similarly discouraged by the reorganization.
"The underlying principle of the program is to
promote student involvement and student respon
sibility for their own education," Jelliffe said, going
on to speculate that the proposed reorganization
would "severely compromise if not completely un
dermine" that principle.
Gurin-Reid, the I AC program coordinator, said
the proposed staff structure will prove inadequate.
"I don't see where there are enough people
hours (in the proposed staff) to provide the depth
and quality of courses that we can provide now,"
she said.
All of the staffers expressed dissatisfaction with
Winkler's administration of the program. One
questioned his "understanding of, and commitment
to, the collaborative process." None, however, said

that personal problems alone triggered the reor
ganization.
Several staff members expressed fear that the
staff change is another step toward phasing out
extra-departmental courses entirely, but Lougee
firmly discounted that possibility.
"There's no sense in which it (the I AC program)
is on its way out," Lougee said. She went on to
point out that more resources are being directed to
the I AC: stipends are being paid to teachers for the
first time, and the program will be moved into the
new Sweet Hall to bring it closer to the center of
student activity.
Winkler said he envisions a "full-time scholar
activist" joining the staff, and said he thinks the
reorganized office "would be completely faithful to
the tradition of SWOPSI."
