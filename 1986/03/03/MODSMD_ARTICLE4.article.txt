# IAC to be restructured

### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
In a controversial move aimed at bringing more aca
demic strength to three extra-departmental academic pro
grams, the administrative staff of the Innovative Aca
demic Courses (lAC) office will he restructured before
the end of the school year.
The lAC staff, which administers the Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI), the
Undergraduate Special Courses (UGS) and the
Freshman-Sophomore Seminars, currently consists of a
faculty director, a professional co-director, a student co
director, a program coordinator and a program assistant.
The proposed restructuring, engineered by Assoc. Dean
of Humanities and Sciences Carolyn Lougee and current
lAC Faculty Director Jack Winkler, reportedly calls for
the hiring of administrators with stronger academic back
grounds, specifically doctorate level education.
According to Lougee, the reorganization is a product of
"a significant rethinking" about lAC spurred primarily by
the Arrow Report. That report, released in the late sum
mer of 1984, was the work of a commission led by Eco
nomics Prof. -Kenneth Arrow, and it reviewed five extra
departmental programs, including SWOPSI and UGS.
The report lauded the SWOPSI program and its staff, but
raised concerns that SWOPSI and UGS courses "were not
as rigorous and demanding academically" as other Stan
ford course offerings.
I he initial response to the report was the joining of
SWOPSI, UGS and the Freshman and Sophomore Semi
nar program in the fall under the umbrella lAC. headed
by Winkler, a classics professor. At the same time, the
Student Center for Innovative Research and Education
(SCIRE) and the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) were dismantled.
Lougee pointed to three goals in the newly planned
restructuring of the I AC staff: strengthening the academic
profile of the programs, maintaining closeness to students
and making the programs under lAC a more important
part of the undergraduate program at Stanford.
"We want these courses to play a more important role
because the need for critical evaluation of politics and so
cial issues is very great today," Lougee said. "They (the
programs) had become on the periphery of student inter
est and the periphery of institutional concern, and they
are not as strong as they should be academically or in the
servicing of student needs."
The current lAC staffers, however, do not think the
change bodes well for SWOPSI and the other academic
