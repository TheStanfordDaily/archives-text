# Palme's murder possibly planned
## 
### 
STOCKHOLM — Police said yesterday that
Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme's assassination
was almost certainly planned in advance and ap
peared to be the work of a calcuated killer rather
than a crazed psychopath.
At a news conference at Stockholm's central
police headquarters. Police Commissioner Hans
Holmersaid Palme's assassin had followed him "at
least during Friday."
Police also said that, employing tests on the bul
lets that killed the Swedish leader, they had identi
fied the murder weapon as a .38 calibre revolver.
They described the type of bullets used in the kil
ling as being of a copper-jacketed kind rarely seen
in Sweden.
Palme, who was twice Sweden's prime minister
for a total of 11 years and was one of his country's
most influential international statesmen, was killed
by a lone assassin as he strolled home from the
movies with his wife. Lisbeth, late Friday night.
"We reckon that the murderer followed them to
the movies and waited in or around the movie
h<\nsp to make the assault," Holmersaid. "He fol

lowed them at least during Friday. I feel the murder
was planned."
Those charged with providing personal security
lor Palme and other high-ranking Swedish officials
admitted Saturday that the prime minister was
without any personal bodyguard for a period of 12
hours before the assassination.
Although such an absence of protection is vir
tually unheard of for most major heads of govern
ment. Palme was reported to have frequently dis
missed his bodyguards and taken pride in the fact
that he could move freely through the streets with
out concern.
With political assassination unknown in modern
Sweden, such light security did not seem irrespon
sible. The level of violence here is well below that
of other Western nations.
Police have been quick to underscore that
Palme s successor, acting Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson, has a 24-hour bodyguard.
As part of a public appeal for information from
anyone who might have seen Palme and his wife —
and possibly the assassin — Friday evening, Hol
mer carefully retraced the couple's 20-minute trip

from their residence to the movie theater, which in
cluded a brief ride on the city's subway.
"We're seeking information," Holmer said.
"We're still chasing the murderer; however, at the
moment, we have no hot clues."
He said that more than 1,000 persons had given
information to the police so far.
But later yesterday, it appeared that police were
working with a more detailed description of the kil
ler than previously believed.
Sources close to the police appeared to clarity
earlier confusion by stating the Palme's widow had
seen the killer and given a description to the police.
Palme's 23-year-old son. Marten, who had met
his parents briefly outside the theater after the
movie, provided a very similar description to police
of a man loitering around the movie house en
trance, these sources said.
Police have reportedly begun to rule out the pos
sibility that the killing was a psychopathic act.
Seeming to rule out such a conclusion were the ap
parently careful planning of the crime and the rela
tive ease with which the killer made his getaway.
