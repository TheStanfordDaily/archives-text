MANILA, Philippines and
WASHINGTON — President
Corazon Aquino yesterday asked the
Filipinos who propelled her into of
fice to organize themselves to protect
her hold on power and require public
accountability of her government.
Speaking to hundreds of thousands
of cheering Filipinos at a rally and
thanksgiving mass, Aquino warned
lhat "the situation, while stable, is not
totally under control yet." Saying that
"there are still holdout pockets of
military and civilian loyalists" of
deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos, she asked her supporters to
channel the "people's power" that
overthrew Marcos last week into
grass-roots organizations "for
meaningful participation of the
citizenry and the shaping of our na
tion's future."
The crowd cheered enthusiastically
when Aquino began her speech by
proclaiming the restoration of habeas
corpus, suspended by Marcos after he
lifted martial law in 1981. Aquino
declared that the suspension of the
law, which safeguards against illegal
arrest, had harmed the country's fight
against a Communist insurgency.
In an appearance before the widest
audience since she took office,
Aquino brought a roar of approval

from the crowd with her congratula
tions on the ouster of Marcos.
"Standing before you today," she
declared, "I have never felt prouder
to be a Filipino."
"People power has brought down a
dictator," she said. "It can support
our drive to make our government a
government of the people."
With the factions of Aquino's
broad opposition movement now
jockeying for influence and govern
ment appointments, political obser
vers here said Aquino wants to in
stitutionalize the street demonstra
tions that swept her into power.
Meanwhile in Washington, Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
yesterday said American forces in the
Philippines gave logistical support to
rebel-piloted helicopter gunships
during the critical face-off last week
between forces loyal to deposed Pres
ident Ferdinand Marcos and the mili
tary faction that supported Aquino.
Cautiously confirming reports of
limited U.S. "aid and comfort" to the
anti-Marcos faction during the three
day crisis that ended in Marcos' ab
dication and flight, Weinberger said
on CBS' "Face the Nation" that the
prime American policy objective was
to avoid a violent confrontation that
could have led to civil war.
