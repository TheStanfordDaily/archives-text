# Mayor's assassination threatens Mideast peace
## 
### 
NABLUS, Israeli-Occupied
West Bank — Two hard-line Pal
estinian groups yesterday claimed
responsibility for the assassination
of Mayor Zafer Masri of Nablus
earlier in the day, and the killing
quickly cast a pall over whatever
slim hopes remained for near-term
progress toward Middle East
peace.
Masri, 45, was seen as a symbol
of efforts to find a new and more
moderate Palestinian leadership
ready to participate in the peace
process.
He was felled by three bullets in
the back, fired by a lone gunman,
as he walked to work yesterday
morning, not long after Jordan's
King Hussein, in a series of
weekend meetings, had called for
West Bank Palestinians to choose
a new leadership or "reconsider
the entire system of their political
representation."
A member of one of the largest
and most influential Palestinian
families in this city, Masri took
over as mayor last December from
the Israeli army officer who had
been in charge here since 1982.
His murder was seen as a possibly

mortal blow to Israeli plans,
already far advanced, to appoint
new Arab mayors in other West
Bank cities as well.
Hard-line Palestinian groups
oppose the plan to install new
West Bank Arab mayors as an Is
raeli subterfuge to forestall
genuine Palestinian self
determination.
The Marxist Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine said in
a statement from Damascus yes
terday that it had carried out a
"death sentence" imposed on
Masri for "dealing with the
Zionist-Jordanian reactionary
plan aimed at liquidating the Pal
estinian cause."
"The PFLP, with this execution,
reminds (that) anyone who at
tempts to deal with this surren
derist scheme will meet the same
fate as this traitor did — whatever
protection he might get from the
Zionist occupation authorities,"
the statement added.
The Jordanian government and
Arafat's Fatah faction, both of
which had tacitly approved Masri's
appointment as mayor, con
demned his murder yesterday.
