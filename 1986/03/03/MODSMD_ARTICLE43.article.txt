Base relocation costly
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon estimates
relocation of the two huge U.S. military bases in
the Philippines would cost upwards of $K billion
and put American military forces a long distance
from potential hot spots, sources say.
A classified report containing the estimate is to
be sent to Congress today, less than a week after
the fall of Ferdinand Marcos and the installation
of Corazon Aquino as president of the longtime
U.S. ally.
The Philippines is home to Subic Bay Naval
Station and Clark Air Base, the largest American
bases outside the United States. The leases on
those bases run out in 1991 and Aquino has
refused to say whether she will let them stay.
The Pentagon report says that if those two
bases are lost, the most stable potential spots to
relocate would be Guam and Tinian islands, ac
cording to the sources, who spoke only on the
condition they not be identified.
At his last news conference. President Reagan

said, "one cannot minimize the importance of
those bases, not only to us, but the western world
and certainly to the Philippines themselves."
Both bases would be difficult to replace, partly
because of their sheer size. Clark sits on 13 1,000
acres while Subic is within a 36,000-acre district.
A key problem in moving the bases to Guam
and Tinian would be the loss of a large, highly
skilled work force. Relocation also would put
American forces farther away from the Indian
Ocean and western Pacific
Seized drug has benzene
WASHINGTON — Half of the cocaine seized
in Florida late last year contained benzene, a car
cinogen that has been banned from consumer
products because it has been shown to cause
leukemia, a federal official said yesterday.
"We see the potential as extremely dangerous
for lung damage or worse," said Robert
Feldkamp, a spokesman for the Drug Enforce
ment Administration. Benzene began to show

up in cocaine in early 1985 after the agency took
steps to prevent illegal drug manufacturers from
obtaining ether, previously a key chemical in
making cocaine, Feldkamp said.
Six years ago, DEA officials determined that
98 percent of the ether being shipped to Colom
bia, one of the primary cocaine exporting
countries, was going to drug traffickers, and only
2 percent to legitimate users.
Cocaine is processed with ether and other sub
stances to make cocaine hydrochloride, the prod
uct reaching most users.
"It was unheard of to manufacture cocaine
without ether," Feldkamp said. "We do know
that despite the campaign, the supply of cocaine
has not diminished. So it was necessary to find
out what was being used instead," Feldkamp
said.
In January 1985, DEA officials began testing
confiscated cocaine to determine what was being
used as a substitute, and test results increasingly
showed benzene.
By last November and December, half of the
cocaine seized in Florida contained benzene.
