Whitworth trial to open
SAN FRANCISCO — The trial of retired
Navy communications expert Jerry Whitworth is
to start in federal court here this week in a case
that should provide the fullest public picture yet
of the damage allegedly caused by the Walker
spy ring and an unprecedented glimpse into the
arcane, supersecret world of military communi
cations and codes.
Whitworth, 46, the last of four Navy men
charged in the Walker espionage ring to appear
in court, is charged with 13 counts of espionage,
conspiracy and federal income tax violations.
The government alleges that, from 1974 until
John Walker Jr.'s arrest May 20, 1985. Whit
worth conspired with Walker to pass classified
defense documents and information. He received
more than $332,000, according to the govern
ment.
A senior chief radioman when he retired from
the Navy in 1983 after a 21-year-career, Whit
worth "received training in virtually all aspects of
Navy communications and served both at sea and
at Navy bases ashore in positions that permitted
him access to a broad spectrum of sensitive mili
tary communications." according to a federal in
dictment.

The most sensitive of the information allegedly
funneled to the Soviets was "cryptographic
kevlists and key cards," the daily-changing codes
that are used to encrypt and read classified
messages, along with technical manuals and
design plans for the coding machines themselves.
With the "logic diagrams" contained in the
manuals, prosecutors said in court papers filed
last month, "a sophisticated adversary having
modern computer capabilities" would have been
able "to re-create the encryption machine."
Armed with both pieces of the cryptographic
puzzle, sources familiar with the technology said,
the Soviets would have been able to listen freely
to some sensitive Navy communications.
The star witness at Whitworth's trial, which is
expected to last eight to 10 weeks, will be his
Navy colleague and close friend Walker, 48, a
retired Navy chief warrant officer and Norfolk
private detective.
Peace march in LA
IRWIN DALE — With 22 miles behind them
and 3.213 to go, more than 1,000 participants in
the Great Peace March for nuclear disarmament
reachcd camp yesterday east of Los Angeles in

good spirits despite a few blisters.
Marchers reached the Santa Fe Dam recrea
tion area beneath the foothills of the San Gabriel
Mountains about 4:30 p.m. yesterday, eight
hours after they broke camp in a parking lot at
California State University-Los Angeles.
"It's terrific," marcher Carol Kinsey, former
assistant to a state assemblyman, said of the
walkers' mood. "They're tired. I think a lot of
people are realizing that 15 miles every day is
tough."
A few people had dropped out and there were
some sore feet, but all in all it had been a good
day's walk, she said, adding, "It's cool out here
which makes it great walking weather, lots of
moisture in the air."
A day earlier the marcher's received a big send
off from Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley at City
Hall before walking east to the university
campus.
Today's weather
Low clouds or fog in the morning, becoming
mostly sunny with highs in the mid-60s to mid
70s. Westerly winds increasing to 20 mph in the
afternoon.
