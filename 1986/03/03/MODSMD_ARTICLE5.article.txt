# Experts discuss computer dangers
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Computers can start a nuclear war, physically
injure humans, give out inaccurate instructions and
invade the privacy of individuals.
Society, which is naive about the capabilities of
computer technology, needs to understand and
control these machines better before such threats
become reality, according to speakers at Saturday's
annual meeting of Computer Professionals for So
cial Responsibility (CPSR).
The speakers focused on the danger of over
reliance on computers, especially in the military

arena.
Warning of the possibility of accidental nuclear
war, Herbert Abrams addressed about 50 people at
the evening banquet that ended the CPSR gather
ing.
Abrams, co-founder of International Physicians
for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), an
organization which won the 1985 Nobel Peace
Prize, illustrated the danger with a fictitious lecture
given by an Argentinian professor in 1998.
The fictional professor tells the history of a nu
clear war that began when a Soviet commander
launched a missile at the U.S. capital without the
knowledge or authorization of leaders in the Krem

lin.
The United States fires buck automatically,
owing to its use of computerized launching of
missiles. The Soviet Union, unaware of its com
mander's action, believes the White House has
made a preemptive strike and launches its own
missiles.
Within hours major portions of both superpower
nations are devastated. Nuclear winter begins.
"How lucky we are in Argentina not to have had
nuclear weapons," the professor tells the class.
"Neither Reagan nor (Soviet leader Mikhail i
Gorbachev would start a nuclear war. They know the dan
ger," Abrams told CPSR members at Rickey's Hyatt in
Palo Alto. "A nuclear war is likely to begin despite the
fact that neither side desires it and both sides follow pro
grams to avoid it."
The unreliability of computers and military systems
makes the possibility of accidentally starting a nuclear war
very real. "As systems become increasingly complex, the
possibility of malfunctions rises," said Abrams, professor
of radiology at the Stanford Medical School.
Abrams cited the use of launch-on-warning capability
iL-OWC) as a major concern. "The most serious aspect
(of the system) is the decreasing time span allowed to
assess the situation and make a decision," he said.
The use of LOWC — a computer system that can auto
matically launch nuclear missiles if electronic sensors indi
cate that the United States is under attack — is an exam
ple of unwarranted dependence on computers, according
to Clifford Johnson, a manager at Stanford's Information
Technology Services who spoke at the morning session.
Not only the military is affected with problems arising
from the increased use of computers. In some areas, the
threats are starting to be realized.
There is the case of the robot that pinned a human em
ployee, and another case in which a defective medical
computer system resulted in the death of a young man.
Relating these grim stories, Palo Alto attorney Susan
Nycuni said the increased use of artificial intelligence
raises the question of legal liability. The courts must
decide who is responsible for the damages as well as the
extent of responsibility, she said.
Defects in the injurious machines could be caused by
anything from incorrect data programmed into the system
to a design oversight that makes turning off robots diffi
cult, Nycum said.
Another threat posed by computers is the invasion of
privacy. The law must take steps to protect the civil
liberties of individuals, according to Marc Rotenberg, a
Stanford law student and founder of the Public Interest
Computing Association in Washington, D.C.
Privacy protection is lagging behind the available tech
nology, Rotenberg said. Part of the problem Ls that large
organizations, such as government agencies, private busi
ness and law enforcement "have an enormous appetite of
personal information," he said.
In World War 11, for example, census information was
used in California to identify people of Japanese origin for
internment and to locate their land and businesses for
confiscation, according to Rotenberg.
