# Guys and Dollies: Band finds new faces
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
It is 10:30 Saturday morning, and while the Terman
Auditorium audience of 100 or so band members and ex-
Dollies is behaving in a manner reminiscent of the Sunday
Flicks crowd, a small group of comely would-be Dollies
with numbered placards pinned to their shirts seem
decidedly tense.
"There were 34 girls try ing out originally, and 18 have
made it this far," Assistant Band Director Todd Olson,
known in some circles as the "Dolly Daddy," said. "By
tonight, it will be cut down to 10."

Feature

Olson explained !he traditional format by which the
Dollies are chosen: the first paring-down is made by the
current Dollies, the second by Dollies and band members,
and the final cut —completed Sunday at 5 a.m. — is again
made by band members and Dollies.
"We're very frank when we're discussing all these
girls," Olson said. "We look at the individual and how
they work as a team."
The band then hand-delivers rejection letters, Olson
explained, and kidnaps the newly-chosen cheerleaders,
treating them to an early morning breakfast outing.
How important are good looks?
"It depends on the individual judge," Olson said. "I'd
say half looks, half dancing."
The form used Saturday morning invites a rating of

The new edition of the Stanford Dollies: Dineen Johnson, Lisa Larragoite, Vicky Takat
suka, Katie (ienshlea and Julie Nasif. The new crop of dancers/cheerleaders was selectec
by current band members and f>ollies this weekend.
