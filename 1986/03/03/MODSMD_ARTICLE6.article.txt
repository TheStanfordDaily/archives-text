# Guys and Dollies: Band finds new faces
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
It is 10:30 Saturday morning, and while the Terman
Auditorium audience of 100 or so band members and ex-
Dollies is behaving in a manner reminiscent of the Sunday
Flicks crowd, a small group of comely would-be Dollies
with numbered placards pinned to their shirts seem
decidedly tense.
"There were 34 girls try ing out originally, and 18 have
made it this far," Assistant Band Director Todd Olson,
known in some circles as the "Dolly Daddy," said. "By
tonight, it will be cut down to 10."

Olson explained !he traditional format by which the
Dollies are chosen: the first paring-down is made by the
current Dollies, the second by Dollies and band members,
and the final cut —completed Sunday at 5 a.m. — is again
made by band members and Dollies.
"We're very frank when we're discussing all these
girls," Olson said. "We look at the individual and how
they work as a team."
The band then hand-delivers rejection letters, Olson
explained, and kidnaps the newly-chosen cheerleaders,
treating them to an early morning breakfast outing.
How important are good looks?
"It depends on the individual judge," Olson said. "I'd
say half looks, half dancing."
The form used Saturday morning invites a rating of

during three dance routines, two
taught by this year s Dollies and
one original dance.
At 11 a.m., the first two of the
18 semifinalists walk onto the
auditorium stage, sporting T
shirts, shorts and the numbers " 1"
and "2." A tape player suddenly
blasts out a distorted rendition of
the Band playing "Squeezebox,"
and the pair jump into their
recently learned routine. The au

writes a zero on his scorecard and
giggles.

pointed out.

"Have a beer,"he advised me.
Freshman Lani Kanehe, who
was not destined to be a Dolly this
year, said after her tryout that she
hoped to become a Dolly because
she liked to perform.
"I love to be in front of a
crowd," Kanehe said. "It's sexist
to some degree, but it's all in good
fun. You have to take it with a
grain of salt."
This reporter wasn't invited to
the final cut, but glimpsed the five
future stars at a Daily photo ses
sion yesterday afternoon. They
are: freshman Katie Genshlea
(who played a Dolly in last year's
Gaieties), Vicky Takatsuka, Julie
Nasif, Dineen Johnson and sopho
more Lisa Larragoite. The new
drum major will be senior Brian
Pike. And from such is history
made.
