# Johnson will refile

### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Clifford Johnson announced
Saturday that he plans to refile a
lawsuit May 1 seeking to declare
computer-controlled launching of
nuclear missiles by the United
States unconstitutional.
Speaking at the annual meeting
of Computer Professionals for So
cial Responsibility, Johnson, a
manager at Stanford's Information
Technology Services, passed
around copies of the rough draft of
his claim, which contends that use
of launch-on-warning capability
(LOWC) is unconstitutional be
cause it delegates to a computer
the Congressional authority to
declare war.
LOWC is a computer system
that would automatically launch

nuclear missiles if electronic sen
sors indicate that the nation is un
der attack, fhe standard position
of the Department of Defense is
that LOWC does not exist, ac
cording to Johnson, who contends
that evidence indicates that the
United States does use LOWC.
Johnson's original suit, filed on
Feb. 29, 1984, was dismissed in
November by a three-member
panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
The revised suit, to be filed with
the U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, alleges the technical
feasibility of LOWC and its exis
tence as an official policy. The
judges had dismissed the original
suit on the grounds that because
those allegations were not made,
the issue of constitutionality could
not be discussed.
