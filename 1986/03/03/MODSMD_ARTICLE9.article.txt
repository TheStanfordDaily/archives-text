# Party shut down after disturbance

### RUSSELL KOROBKIN 
Six or seven Stanford police officers shut
down a party at the Theta Xi fraternity house
Saturday morning because of disturbances
caused by non-Stanford students, according to
House Manager Ted Lynch.
House officers decided that the party was
"out of control" and called the police between
12:30 and I a.m., Lynch said. The call was
placed after the house officers attempted to end
the party themselves. "The power was turned
off three separate times," Lynch said, adding
that their efforts had "no effect whatsoever."
The decision to call the police was the result
of "a few too many random people from off
campus" attending the party, Lynch said.
According to Theta Xi Social Chairman Matt
Bruck v "We had two bands and they're both
sort of punk. . . . Lots of their friends came to
the party." The fraternity allowed the bands a
guest list of 15, Lynch added.
"The atmosphere got kind of rowdy." Bruck
said. There was concern that "the house would
get trashed."
According to Bruck, fraternity members
checked for Stanford identification and stamped

hands at the door, but "people were sneaking in
windows and up the tire escape.
The non-Stanford students "weren't the typi
cal | Palo Alto High School I crowd." said Bruck,
who identified the party crashers as
"distinctively punk." Lynch guessed that they
were "about the same age group you'd find at
Stanford."
I'he police officers arrived, discussed the sit
uation with Theta Xi house officers, and went
inside and "cleared people out," according to
Lynch. "They were extremely helpful." he said.
The police told the crowd " 'if you don't live
here, leave,' " Bruck said, adding that there was
"no problem, no resistance.'
Fraternal Adviser Joe Pisano said yesterday
he was unaware of the incident, but he added,
"1 don't think its very wise to have parties with a
lot of off-campus people.
"People need to take steps before there is any
administrative edict banning anything," Pisano
said, although he emphasized that a ban on non-
Stanford people attending parties is unlikely to
occur in the near future.
Stanford police could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
