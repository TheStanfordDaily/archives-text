Stanford ranked third in federally
funded research among U.S. colleges
and universities in fiscal year 1984,
according to the National Science
Foundation (NSF).
Johns Hopkins, which manages the
U.S. Navy's Applied Physics Labora
tory, ranked first, with $467 million.
The Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology was second, with $179 mil
lion. followed by Stanford with $160
million.
Other universities in the top 10 in
cluded: the University of Washing

SIO4 million; and the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, $ 100 million.
According to Bonnie Hale, infor
mation editor for the Sponsored Proj

on three types of outside support for
research: tederal grants and con

University Vice Provost Robert
Street stressed that "Stanford
depends to a large extent on external
sources to support programs of re
search. instruction and scholarship."
Federal contracts and grants help
fund projects in nearly all areas of the
University, including the graduate
schools, the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the University libraries
and the Hoover Institution.
The largest percentage of 1985
federal funding from a particular
federal agency came from the De
partment of Health and Human

44.1 percent of Stanford's 1985
federal funding, according to the
report.
lhe Department of Defense was
second with a 17.8 percent stake in
Stanford research projects. The De
partment of Energy ranked third with
10.4 percent.
Stanford's 1984 figure of $ 160 mil
lion and 1985 figure of $190 million
tor total fiscal year federally funded
research do not include government
aid to the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC).
SL AC received $109 million from
the Department of Energy in 1984
and $135 million in 1985, according
to Sponsored Projects reports for
those years.
