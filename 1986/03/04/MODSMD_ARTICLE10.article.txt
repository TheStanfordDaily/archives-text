The Speakers Bureau obtains speakers by doing "a
massive letter-writing campaign in the beginning of the
year," said member Mary Thurber, who is also an ASSU

Osborn added that close contact is maintained with
those who express interest in speaking at Stanford. The
bureau is responsible for taking care of all details involved

todial work.
Previous events sponsored or co-sponsored by the
bureau this year include a debate on apartheid, a forum
on AIDS, the Bay Area Writer Series and speeches by
journalist Hunter S. Thompson, former U.S. Rep. Shirley
Chisholm, South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and
former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
Ferraro cancelled her engagement at the last minute
Feb. 21, costing the bureau an estimated $2,000, accord
ing to Osborn.
Osborn said the bureau is requesting a special fee of
$66,000 this spring, which would give it a working budget
of $50,000 after special fee refunds. Osborn argued that
this budget is not too high, saying celebrities on the level
of Henry Kissinger or Carl Sagan normally charge
$20,000 per speech.
