Of all the American love affairs with sports, none is
older or more powerful than our romance with major
league baseball. For a great many of us, the smell of
fresh grass in the sunshine, the feel of a grounder
leaping into the glove webbing and the sound of a bat
cracking cleanly into a fastball are the sounds of spring
and summer, the sounds of our youth and innocence
remembered.
Baseball has always been more than a game for
Americans; it has been a symbol of purity, an echo of
older, simpler memories, a beautiful and necessary il
lusion.
That is why the slow crumbling of the baseball mys
tique over the last decade has been such a painful ex
perience for us. Deep down, we want our boys of sum
mer to be just that — boys, with none of the greed and
vices that we mere mortals have inherited. Ricky Nel
son shouldn't freebase, we think; baseball players
shouldn't traipse into a Pittsburgh courtroom and tes
tily to snorting cocaine in the clubhouse before games.
Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth under
stands that sentiment. He also understands that if
baseball is to be a profitable enterprise, it must pander
to that sentiment — it cannot afford to be linked with
drug use. Last Friday, he took a decisive first step
toward eliminating drugs in the major leagues, handing
down some of the severest punishments in the history
of the sport to 11 players fingered in the Pittsburgh
trial of cocaine dealer Curtis Strong.
Seven of those players must either accept a one-year
suspension or donate 10 percent of this year's salary to
a drug prevention program, contribute 100 hours of

drug-related community service in each of the next two
years and submit to random drug testing for the rest of
their careers.
The other four must either accept a 60-day suspen
sion or donate 5 percent of their salaries to a drug pro
gram, contribute 50 hours of community service over a
one-year period and submit to random drug testing for
the rest of their careers.
One of those players — New York Mets first
baseman Keith Hernandez — plans to file a grievance
with the players association, saying "Obviously, I'm
not pleased with the decision of the commisioner."
Why? Even though they testified under immunity,
Hernandez and Co. broke the law, and Ueberroth's
punishment could easily have been a lot worse. But in
stead of banning the players from baseball, which
would have solved nothing, Ueberroth came up with a
ruling that is both fair and beneficial to people in and
out of baseball. It makes the players think about their
habit by taking money out of their pockets and making
them work against drugs in their communities, and it is
a deterrent to future drug use.
It is also only a first step. The Ueberroth 11 are the
most visible of the major league drug abusers, but their
punishment does not solve the larger problem.
Baseball must formulate a clear policy for dealing with
drug use, a policy which focuses on the education and
rehabilitation of those players involved with drugs. If
drugs continue to be a problem, perhaps a temporary
period of mandatory random testing for all players
would be appropriate. Drug abuse does not belong in
baseball, and the major leagues must continue to work
toward eradicating it from the game.
