## Hiring procedures questionable 
### 
In the article "Hiring practice fair, profs agree," (Daily,
Feb. 27) the professors quoted seem largely to miss the
point. That the procedural rules were followed fairly and
honestly within their own terms was not seriously at ques
tion. The department is currently allowed to completely
disregard the recommendation of a search committee by
simple majority vote, without demonstrating any attempt

to examine the scholar's credentials beforehand. What is
at question are the grotesque results, judging from the
facts reported in the two Daily articles on the issue.
Norman Davies has received the highest possible praise
from distinguished peers. The recommendation of the
search committe was unamimous. The chair is specifically
in East European studies and has been vacant for eight
years.
In the face of this we have the following justifications:
History Prof. Paret suggests, by implication, that Davies
doesn't fit the needs of the department, using the analogy:
"If a small department like ours has three intellectual his
torians already, it might not hire a fourth, even if he is a
very good historian." Is Paret trying to say that the
small Stanford History Department of only 73 has no
opening for an East Europeanist, despite a designated
professorship which has been empty nearly a decade?
That it feels it should not fill what is also a waiting slot in
the interdisciplinary Center for Russian and Eastern
European Studies?
Assoc. History Prof. Sabine MacCormack says, "When
you write a national history, a history of a whole country,
there are always divergent and conflicting interests and
viewpoints at stake that have to be taken account of."
This is confusing. Is she saying Davies failed to take such
viewpoints into account in his enormously acclaimed
book, in other words that he is a bad scholar? Why not say
so clearly? Or does she mean that if Davies' scholarly

views differ from a colleague's, the colleague is bound to
take offense, and further, vote him down? If so, is that the
notion of scholarly debate and academic freedom current
at Stanford?
History Department Chairman Paul Robinson said,
"The discussions dealt with nothing other than the quality
of his scholarship and teaching." Are we to understand
that somehow Davies wasn't good enough? By what
evidence? If nothing else was discussed, then what about
Paret's statement about the."needs of the department"?
What about MacCormack's other fears of controversy?
If I didn't know that such things never happen, espe
cially in academia, I might be tempted to think that these
were lame and silly excuses hastily contrived to cover a
horrible embarrassment to the department. I might even

recall that in Britain, where Davies comes from, the de
partment is not invited to vote on the search committee's
decision because experience has shown that professional
disagreement and jealousy is liable to interfere with ob
jective judgement.
But fortunately, such things don't happen, so even
though the Stanford history department seems to have
thrown away the chance to get a great man, it need not
wonder why.
