Fill TA spots with
law, GSB students
The Daily's article "TAs carry
power, pressures" (Feb. 28) raised
serious questions about the use of un
dergraduates as teaching assistants.
Many have little or no teaching ex
perience. A few teach classes outside
of their departmental major. Some
feel pressure from friends regarding
assignments and grading. Professors
recognize these problems but hire un
dergraduates, it seems, because there
are not enough graduate students to
do the work.
I propose a simple, perhaps over
looked solution: hire law and busi
ness school students. The academic
standards for admission to the two
schools is extremely high; there are
literally hundreds of students who
graduated with honors in a variety of
undergraduate disciplines. Many
have advanced degrees and experi
ence in teaching. Because they are
older and more removed from under
graduate life, they would not face the
pressures described by the under
graduate teaching assistants.
Stanford undergraduates pay high
tuition fees. They deserve the best in
struction possible. Hiring law and
business students as teaching assis
tants will help towards that end.
I know that law students have
worked as teaching assistants in the
Political Science and Human Biology
departments. I am certain that other
law and business students are inter

ested in being teaching assistants. The
financial incentive and fun of teach
ing make these positions attractive.
Law and business students are an im
portant resource that other under
graduate departments should tap.

Bicycle anarchy
needs some limits
Although I agree in principle with
most of Allen Estes' philosophy of
bicycle anarchy (Feb. 19), I disagree
on how bicycle anarchy should be ex
pressed. Many of the Uniform Traffic
Code regulations are often best
ignored or at least pragmatically in
terpreted "en route." However, wan
ton disregard for the safety of others
is an endemic attitude of Stanford
cyclists.
Automobiles, pedestrians and
bicycles compete for limited space on
campus roads, walkways, alleys,
bicycle paths and pedestrian cros
swalks. The most pernicious of the lot
are by far the bicycles and their bas
tard hybrid brethren, the mopeds.
Considered neither automobiles nor
motorcycles, drivers of these half
breed menaces become crazed Evil
Knievels or daredevil racers wending
their reckless way through throngs of
human slalom poles.
As Estes points out, these infernal
machines, both human and petrol
powered, exist in some netherworld
of arbitrarily enforced regulation de

signed for a universe populated by
automobiles and people. Obviously,
decisions and actions must take place
quickly and with less regard for con
vention than expedience.
But there is an immense difference
between running a stop sign or light
after reasonable inspection for the
presence of other entities, and wan
tonly running down unsuspecting
pedestrians. We all disregard the
abominable light at the corner of
Palm Drive and Arboretum, where
the alternative to a mild act of civil
disobedience is an interminable,
lonesome wait at 2 a.m.
However, this is radically different
from zipping through the Quad at
warp three at 9:55 a.m. You put your
bloody life in their hands just walking
to class around here. It can become a
literal pain in the ass, as a colleague
of mine discovered the other day
when, as we walked from class in the
Quad, he was creamed from behind
by an irresponsible twit on a bicycle
and splattered, along with her, the
bicycle and an assortment of books
and notes, across the adjacent lawn.
I am not suggesting a major revi
sion to the Uniform Traffic Code to
mete out hard time in Folsom Prison
or even community service at public
landfills to errant or disrepectful
bicyclists and mopedists. Most rules
are made to be at least abused if not
broken, and we all make decisions
daily regarding which to abuse.
However, when it comes to abusing
people, public response to recal
citrant cyclists may take the form of

stricter enforcement of existing regu
lations, or manifest itself as true
bicycle anarchy with cyclists playing
Marcos to an irate public mob.

Attack on Hoover
shows intolerance
There seems to be a law of conser
vation of aggressiveness. In the
19505, the right was out to get various
leftists on charges of being allies of
Stalin. Today the left is out to get
whole institutions, e.g. Hoover, on
charges of being allies of Reagan.
Consider last Thursday's statement
by 16 Stanford professors. The idea
that the University can legitimately
disassociate itself from "ongoing em
barrassment" by "divorcing itself"
from a part of itself is reminiscent of
my namesake Joe. The current casus
belli, two Hoover faculty members
taking part in a study that might reach
conclusions that offend the "gay com
munity" is absurd. Such fantasies can
only flourish in the intellectual equiv
alent of a backward village or a party
cell, where any hint of deviation from
orthodox views is regarded as a sin.
I suppose the danger of their get
ting people fired is remote, but it's
worth remembering Voltaire's
saying: "Those who can make you
believe absurdities can make you
commit atrocities ''

dergraduates, it seems, because there
are not enough graduate students to
do the work.
I propose a simple, perhaps over
looked solution: hire law and busi
ness school students. The academic
standards for admission to the two
schools is extremely high; there are
literally hundreds of students who
graduated with honors in a variety of
undergraduate disciplines. Many
have advanced degrees and experi
ence in teaching. Because they are
older and more removed from under
graduate life, they would not face the
pressures described by the under
graduate teaching assistants.
Stanford undergraduates pay high
tuition fees. They deserve the best in
struction possible. Hiring law and
business students as teaching assis
tants will help towards that end.
I know that law students have
worked as teaching assistants in the
Political Science and Human Biology
departments. I am certain that other
law and business students are inter

ested in being teaching assistants. The
financial incentive and fun of teach
ing make these positions attractive.
Law and business students are an im
portant resource that other under
graduate departments should tap.

Bicycle anarchy
needs some limits
Although I agree in principle with
most of Allen Estes' philosophy of
bicycle anarchy (Feb. 19), I disagree
on how bicycle anarchy should be ex
pressed. Many of the Uniform Traffic
Code regulations are often best
ignored or at least pragmatically in
terpreted "en route." However, wan
ton disregard for the safety of others
is an endemic attitude of Stanford
cyclists.
Automobiles, pedestrians and
bicycles compete for limited space on
campus roads, walkways, alleys,
bicycle paths and pedestrian cros
swalks. The most pernicious of the lot
are by far the bicycles and their bas
tard hybrid brethren, the mopeds.
Considered neither automobiles nor
motorcycles, drivers of these half
breed menaces become crazed Evil
Knievels or daredevil racers wending
their reckless way through throngs of
human slalom poles.
As Estes points out, these infernal
machines, both human and petrol
powered, exist in some netherworld
of arbitrarily enforced regulation de

signed for a universe populated by
automobiles and people. Obviously,
decisions and actions must take place
quickly and with less regard for con
vention than expedience.
But there is an immense difference
between running a stop sign or light
after reasonable inspection for the
presence of other entities, and wan
tonly running down unsuspecting
pedestrians. We all disregard the
abominable light at the corner of
Palm Drive and Arboretum, where
the alternative to a mild act of civil
disobedience is an interminable,
lonesome wait at 2 a.m.
However, this is radically different
from zipping through the Quad at
warp three at 9:55 a.m. You put your
bloody life in their hands just walking
to class around here. It can become a
literal pain in the ass, as a colleague
of mine discovered the other day
when, as we walked from class in the
Quad, he was creamed from behind
by an irresponsible twit on a bicycle
and splattered, along with her, the
bicycle and an assortment of books
and notes, across the adjacent lawn.
I am not suggesting a major revi
sion to the Uniform Traffic Code to
mete out hard time in Folsom Prison
or even community service at public
landfills to errant or disrepectful
bicyclists and mopedists. Most rules
are made to be at least abused if not
broken, and we all make decisions
daily regarding which to abuse.
However, when it comes to abusing
people, public response to recal
citrant cyclists may take the form of

stricter enforcement of existing regu
lations, or manifest itself as true
bicycle anarchy with cyclists playing
Marcos to an irate public mob.

Attack on Hoover
shows intolerance
There seems to be a law of conser
vation of aggressiveness. In the
19505, the right was out to get various
leftists on charges of being allies of
Stalin. Today the left is out to get
whole institutions, e.g. Hoover, on
charges of being allies of Reagan.
Consider last Thursday's statement
by 16 Stanford professors. The idea
that the University can legitimately
disassociate itself from "ongoing em
barrassment" by "divorcing itself"
from a part of itself is reminiscent of
my namesake Joe. The current casus
belli, two Hoover faculty members
taking part in a study that might reach
conclusions that offend the "gay com
munity" is absurd. Such fantasies can
only flourish in the intellectual equiv
alent of a backward village or a party
cell, where any hint of deviation from
orthodox views is regarded as a sin.
I suppose the danger of their get
ting people fired is remote, but it's
worth remembering Voltaire's
saying: "Those who can make you
believe absurdities can make you
commit atrocities ''

Fill TA spots with
law, GSB students
The Daily's article "TAs carry
power, pressures" (Feb. 28) raised
serious questions about the use of un
dergraduates as teaching assistants.
Many have little or no teaching ex
perience. A few teach classes outside
of their departmental major. Some
feel pressure from friends regarding
assignments and grading. Professors
recognize these problems but hire un
dergraduates, it seems, because there
are not enough graduate students to
do the work.
