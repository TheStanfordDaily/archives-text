# Our prejudices come in all sizes
## 
### 
In high school, there was a boy whom 1 hated. I hated
him from freshman year through senior year, from the
first day of school to the last. Oh, he seemed innocuous,
perhaps even friendly, but I was resolved that his harmless
and amiable exterior served merely as a masquerade for
the hateful beast which truly characterized him. The first
moment I saw him sauntering across the central lawn of
campus, I became instantly aware that something about
him was not right: He was not right.
I recall my introduction to him; he had decided to join
the cross-country team on the same day I had. I remember
the cold civility in my voice as I acknowledged his exis
tence with an abrupt and ungracious "Hello." With each

class, with each cross-country workout, with each purely
accidental encounter, I became increasingly annoyed by
his presence on this earth. I publicly criticized and
ridiculed the funny curve of his nose, the clumsiness of his
action, the unattractive sallowness of his skin. I privately
bewailed my unjust affliction with his existence; in turn, I
cursed him and blamed him for inconsiderately wasting
my time — I had better things to do than criticize an indi
vidual whose only discernable purpose in life was to vex
me.
My principle grievance against him was the irritating
and embarrassing fact that I had no justifiable reason to
bear any antipathy toward him. Finally, during my junior
year, I grasped the reason which had eluded me for two
and-a-half years: it was his manner of walking. I realize
that to others his style of ambulation might seem to be a
paltry and insufficient source of so much ill-will, but evi
dently it was important to me at the time. He walked with
out swaying his arms. I don't believe that most people are
aware of the enormity of his crime. He really walked with
out using his arms. Worse yet, he ran that way.
I have tried to simulate his style of walking, only to fail
and fall back into the more natural manner of walking in
comfortable synchronization with the swaying of my arms.
It is absolutely impossible for me to move myself in such
an unnatural way, and I can see now how I had uncon
sciously perceived and condemned the perversity of na
ture his movement represented. I remember feeling a
wave of welcome relief after I had defined my reasons for
disliking, no, hating him so. I felt I could bury the hatchet
and start anew; I could be more than coldly civil toward
him. No such luck. Strangely enough, I found I was never
able to accept his unique style of walking; I could never
forget my torment with this unnatural movement. To the

very end of senior year, I considered him an annoying
nimrod, a clumsy Neanderthal.
There was a girl in my journalism class who disturbed
me almost to the same extent. During those rare times I
found myself cornered into a conversation with her, I felt
my irritation with her rising until it reached a point at
which it was transformed from mere annoyance into
reserved anger. Although I knew she was intelligent, I
labelled her as chatty, bubble-headed, superficial and
haughty.
I sedulously proved the reasons for my unfounded
dislike and eventually came up with the culprit: her hair. I
was irritated by the fact that her hair did not move. She
would flippantly toss her head from side to side, turn her
head to answer a question, or lean her head on the palm of
her hand — no matter what she did, her hair remained un
altered, intact and perfectly styled. I think it was shel
lacked.
I realize that at this point, some must be questioning my
judgment; rather than labeling the girl in my journalism
class as the haughty and superficial one, I should be taking
a look at myself. And yet I am not haughty or superficial,
no more than anyone else, at least.
I am struck by the fact that the judgments we all form
ulate about people are often founded on superficial and il
logical grounds; moreover, these typically erroneous as
sumptions about people prove to be quite persistent and
resistant to change. Even after realizing the nonsense of
my dislike for the Neanderthal, I could not shake loose my
original conviction that he was strange, and his weirdness
was enough to incite my stand-offishness and even my
contempt.
It is evident that these are not merely incidents of trivial
and individualistic idiosyncracies, they are clearly exam
ples of unfounded prejudice and unjustifiable ill-will. Al
though it is true that these experiences may not be exam
ples of the racial prejudice that one often thinks of when
reminded of the word "prejudice," they neverthless effec
tively expose the irrationalities which constitute the
backbone of prejudice in general.
It seems particularly appropriate that 1 write this
column on the eve of the forum on racism (Feb. 27), an
event that will address prejudice not on an individual
basis, but prejudice on a group and societal level. It is
ironic to note that while I am capable of harboring my
hollow and unjustifiable prejudices, I am, as an Asian,
subject to a similar yet more serious prejudice. Rather
than being judged by the manner in which I hold my arms
as I walk or the way my hair moves when I turn my head, I
am judged by the color of my skin and culture of my
people. I am disheartened by the fact that like the Nean
derthal and the girl with the immobile hair, I will face
people who bear some type of irrational dislike towards
me. Unlike them, however, I'll understand why.
Suddenly, my little prejudices don't seem so innocuous
and insignificant anymore.

event that will address prejudice not on an individual
basis, but prejudice on a group and societal level. It is
ironic to note that while I am capable of harboring my
hollow and unjustifiable prejudices, I am, as an Asian,
subject to a similar yet more serious prejudice. Rather
than being judged by the manner in which I hold my arms
as I walk or the way my hair moves when I turn my head, I
am judged by the color of my skin and culture of my
people. I am disheartened by the fact that like the Nean
derthal and the girl with the immobile hair, I will face
people who bear some type of irrational dislike towards
me. Unlike them, however, I'll understand why.
Suddenly, my little prejudices don't seem so innocuous
and insignificant anymore.

In high school, there was a boy whom 1 hated. I hated
him from freshman year through senior year, from the
first day of school to the last. Oh, he seemed innocuous,
perhaps even friendly, but I was resolved that his harmless
and amiable exterior served merely as a masquerade for
the hateful beast which truly characterized him. The first
moment I saw him sauntering across the central lawn of
campus, I became instantly aware that something about
him was not right: He was not right.
I recall my introduction to him; he had decided to join
the cross-country team on the same day I had. I remember
the cold civility in my voice as I acknowledged his exis
tence with an abrupt and ungracious "Hello." With each

class, with each cross-country workout, with each purely
accidental encounter, I became increasingly annoyed by
his presence on this earth. I publicly criticized and
ridiculed the funny curve of his nose, the clumsiness of his
action, the unattractive sallowness of his skin. I privately
bewailed my unjust affliction with his existence; in turn, I
cursed him and blamed him for inconsiderately wasting
my time — I had better things to do than criticize an indi
vidual whose only discernable purpose in life was to vex
me.
My principle grievance against him was the irritating
and embarrassing fact that I had no justifiable reason to
bear any antipathy toward him. Finally, during my junior
year, I grasped the reason which had eluded me for two
and-a-half years: it was his manner of walking. I realize
that to others his style of ambulation might seem to be a
paltry and insufficient source of so much ill-will, but evi
dently it was important to me at the time. He walked with
out swaying his arms. I don't believe that most people are
aware of the enormity of his crime. He really walked with
out using his arms. Worse yet, he ran that way.
I have tried to simulate his style of walking, only to fail
and fall back into the more natural manner of walking in
comfortable synchronization with the swaying of my arms.
It is absolutely impossible for me to move myself in such
an unnatural way, and I can see now how I had uncon
sciously perceived and condemned the perversity of na
ture his movement represented. I remember feeling a
wave of welcome relief after I had defined my reasons for
disliking, no, hating him so. I felt I could bury the hatchet
and start anew; I could be more than coldly civil toward
him. No such luck. Strangely enough, I found I was never
able to accept his unique style of walking; I could never
forget my torment with this unnatural movement. To the

very end of senior year, I considered him an annoying
nimrod, a clumsy Neanderthal.
There was a girl in my journalism class who disturbed
me almost to the same extent. During those rare times I
found myself cornered into a conversation with her, I felt
my irritation with her rising until it reached a point at
which it was transformed from mere annoyance into
reserved anger. Although I knew she was intelligent, I
labelled her as chatty, bubble-headed, superficial and
haughty.
I sedulously proved the reasons for my unfounded
dislike and eventually came up with the culprit: her hair. I
was irritated by the fact that her hair did not move. She
would flippantly toss her head from side to side, turn her
head to answer a question, or lean her head on the palm of
her hand — no matter what she did, her hair remained un
altered, intact and perfectly styled. I think it was shel
lacked.
I realize that at this point, some must be questioning my
judgment; rather than labeling the girl in my journalism
class as the haughty and superficial one, I should be taking
a look at myself. And yet I am not haughty or superficial,
no more than anyone else, at least.
I am struck by the fact that the judgments we all form
ulate about people are often founded on superficial and il
logical grounds; moreover, these typically erroneous as
sumptions about people prove to be quite persistent and
resistant to change. Even after realizing the nonsense of
my dislike for the Neanderthal, I could not shake loose my
original conviction that he was strange, and his weirdness
was enough to incite my stand-offishness and even my
contempt.
It is evident that these are not merely incidents of trivial
and individualistic idiosyncracies, they are clearly exam
ples of unfounded prejudice and unjustifiable ill-will. Al
though it is true that these experiences may not be exam
ples of the racial prejudice that one often thinks of when
reminded of the word "prejudice," they neverthless effec
tively expose the irrationalities which constitute the
backbone of prejudice in general.
