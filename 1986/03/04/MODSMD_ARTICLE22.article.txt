### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
The piercing blue eyes, magnified to star
tling enormity by the bottle-thick spectacles,
peered owl-like over the surgical mask. Ten
sion hung in the room like a dark cloud about
to burst as the editor raised his exacto knife.
With a sweeping gesture and a sinister cackle,
the editor brought the knife down and began
to cut.
I must begin this week with an apology for
one of my answers last week. If you recall, in
our last episode I addressed a question about
what can be done with a bike that someone
had noticed chained to a fence (and ap
parently abandoned) for two years.
While I was typing the answer to that
question last Monday night, The Daily com
puters crashed completely, and in the result
ing excitement a pretty ample portion of my
answer was jettisoned, making the final
product rather incoherent.
The published answer concluded that
there was really no way for the bike to be
removed. But in fact, I had talked to Doris
Posner in the Resident Manager's Office,
and although that office is really responsible
for picking up only bikes abandoned near
residences (and thus the bike in question
isn't strictly eligible), Mrs. Posner was more
than willing to go pick up this bike, anyway.
She even went so far as to go look for the
bike. But like me, she couldn't find it. The
bottom line, then, is that something can be
done about bikes that have become eyesores
(if they can be located). I don't think that
was clear in last week's column, and I
apologize for the confusion.
Dear Bug Me
Following the first Filipino election fiasco a
few Fridays formerly, I felt my mind franti
cally filling with a flock of questions. Unfor
tunately, I have failed to figure out a few for
myself; frustrated, I find I must fall to you, oh
fantastic finder of facts, to finally ferret out
the answers.

Why do folks spell "Philippines" with a
"Ph" but favor "F" for "Filipinos"? Fur
thermore, with Mr. Ha bib flying to the
Philippines, should we spell his first name
"Filip"?
- Matt Springer, Dept. of Bugology
This question obviously would have been
more timely last week, when it was sched
uled to run. But alas, it, too, perished in the
unpleasantness with the exacto knife.
After asking this question of every on
campus Filipino I know and getting nowhere,
I called a number listed in the San Francisco
phonebook as "Philippine News."

The gentleman there was very helpful. He
said that the "Filipinos" spelling dates from
the original conquest and colonization of the
islands by Spain in the 16th century. /
The king of Spain at that time was Philip
11, and apparently the islands were named
after him. But the Spanish spelling of Philip
is "Filip", so the islands were called the
Filipines, and their inhabitants were called
Filipinos.
The latter moniker stuck, but the spelling
of the islands' name changed when the
United States took over the islands after the
Spanish-American War in 1898. Americans
imposed the English "ph" spelling of Philip,
and ever since the islands have been"the
Philippines," while their inhabitants have
remained "Filipinos."
And now that Marcos is in the United
States, we're going to spell his name
"Pherdinand."
