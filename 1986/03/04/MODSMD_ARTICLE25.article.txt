## Rock 'n' roll women dazzle local crowds

The young woman on stage ad
justed the microphone to her height
and asked, "Can everybody hear me
out there?"
There were a few shouts of "No!
Turn up the vocals!"
"That's too bad," she sighed, sig
naling to her sound man, thumb up,
" 'Cause I like to sing!"
At that point, you could kiss the
upper registers goodbye.
The problem with listening to Lone
Justice at the Keystone Palo Alto
(where the Los Artgeles band played
Friday night) is that lead singer Maria
McKee's voice has too great a range
for such an anti-acoustic hall. When
her voice strays a couple of octaves
above middle C, her'words become a
continuous whine.
Which is too bad, because not only
does she like to sing, she sings well.
From the opening yell, "Should I
go north?" from "East of Eden,"
McKee never let up in her vocal at
tack. In addition, she accompanied
herself on a mean guitar, thrashing it
so brutally she appeared to be having
a seizure.
Billed as a hard-rock group with
gospel/country overtones, Lone
Justice had been bouncing around the
Southern California club circuit until
they picked up McKee. The ensuing
album, "Lone Justice," spawned a
radio hit, "Ways To Be Wicked," and
was included in many critics' year
end "best album" lists for 1985.
Lone Justice performed most of the
songs from their album, with the
notable exception of "Ways To Be
Wicked," and introduced a fair num

ber of new songs. Watch for the bal
lad "Just One More Minute" to be
the hit off their next album.
The band, though clearly not as im
portant as the singer as far as the
packed crowd was concerned,
complemented McKee's driving vo
cals by playing as hard as she sang.
Particularly interesting was her bass
player, Marvin Etzioni, who would
whisper to her between songs and
elicit her angelic smile.
McK.ee also delivered a few
Springsteenish commentaries during
her songs. In one long but compelling
monologue during "Soap, Soup and
Salvation," she explained the back
ground of the song. Apparently, she
has had quite some experience with
inner-city rescue missions. These
talks enabled her to gather strength
for the balance of the song, and pro
vided the audience a momentary
respite from the intensity of her per
formance.
For the encore, Lone Justice per
formed an astonishing medley. They
began with the first two verses of the
Velvet Underground's "Sweet Jane,"
broke into a few lines of Lou Reed's
"Walk On The Wild Side" and
segued from that into a few lines of
Springsteen's "New York City
Serenade" before returning to com
plete the original tune.
Even though most of her vocals
were massacred by the inimical
Keystone design, McKee was clearly
the darling of the crowd's heart. At
the conclusion of the concert, a mem
ber of the audience handed her a
bouquet of roses and, by gosh, she
blushed.

Like good wine, Pat Benatar ap
pears to have gotten better with age.
That's the impression that has
emerged in the two years since "Live
From Earth," the fifth of her seven
albums, and that's the message she
communicated effectively to a full
Oakland Coliseum on the local stop
of her "Seven the Hard Way" tour.
When Benatar came into
prominence in the late '70s with her
albums "In the Heat of the Night"
and "Crimes of Passion," she
combined an aggressive vocal style
with equally forceful sounds from the
lead guitar of Neil Geraldo. Benatar
has had a string of hits on the pop
charts, from the biting "Hit Me with
Your Best Shot" to the melodic "We
Belong."
Lately, Benatar has moved to more
slow-tempo songs in concert and
more use of instrumentals to comple
ment her established repertoire.
Many attribute this transition to her
marriage to Geraldo and to the birth
of her daughter more than a year ago.
Pat Benatar, loving mother and
wife — that's a tough image to digest,
especially for those Benatar
aficionados who became accustomed
to her taunting, I-dare-you -to lyrics,
backed by Geraldo's screaming
guitar. But she has indeed mellowed,
and the results have enhanced, not
replaced, what Benatar offers her au
dience.
There was a poignant example of
this early in the concert. Benatar
prefaced "Run Between the

Raindrops," a mellow song off
"Seven the Hard Way," by mention
ing the daughter "Spider (Geraldo)
and I have." Also, the first of a three
song encore was "Painted Desert," a
slow-tempo selection from "Tropico"
that Benatar called "one of my
favorites."
Remember, though, that Benatar
hasn't totally abandoned the style —
which some saw when Benatar played
at Maples Pavilion in March, 1983
during her "Get Nervous" tour —
that made her famous. She treated
the crowd, which responded accord
ingly, to several of her popular up
beat songs, including "Hit Me With
Your Best Shot," "Heartbreaker,"
"Promises in the Dark," and the
crowd favorite, "Hell is for
Children."
Nevertheless, her show and "Seven
the Hard Way" represent a good
combination of Benatar's former and
recent styles.
The major characteristic of the
lighting — and of the entire concert
— was its taste and restraint. Nothing
was overdone. The lighting, much of
which was pink and black, was effec
tive but not overwhelming. There
were no stage props save for
representations of the number seven
on the drum stage. Benatar let her
music stand alone and speak for itself,
and it did so impressively.
Good friends of mine who'd seen
Benatar on other tours said she had a
tendency to scream, not sing, and that
Geraldo sometimes "played a solo on
every song." To Benatar's credit, nei
ther occurred at the Oakland
Coliseum.
