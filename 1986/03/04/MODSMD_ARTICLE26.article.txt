## McDonnell Douglas courts seniors 
### PHIL BLACK Staff writer 
An engineer graduating from Stanford is going to
work at McDonalds for over $26,000 a year? You
don't believe it? Well, neither did Gregg Jones,
Ray Kroc or I. Jones did have a little more
believable story, however, when he said that he
could offer Stanford engineers a promising job at
McDonnell Douglas, one of the largest aerospace
and defense contracting firms in the country.

Jones graduated from the University of Oregon
and worked with Tektronix, an aerospace concern
in Portland, before moving to McDonnell Douglas,
where he is currently in charge of college recruit
ing. He was in town last Wednesday and 1 took a
few minutes of his time to talk with him about
McDonnell Douglas.
As is the case with many of the firms that come
to Stanford, Jones and McDonnell Douglas like the
quality of students that come out of Stanford each
year. Jones commented, "Stanford is a favorite of
ours because the students in the engineering field
are top-notch.

"Furthermore, the geographical location of Stan
ford is a big asset. Most, if not all, of the students
know what to expect of Long Beach, where
Douglas Aircraft is located."
The people who McDonnell Douglas wants tend
to have some distinguishing characteristics. Jones
remarked, "We look for students who have shown
strong discipline in their academic schedule. Also,
we're looking for students who can recognize prob
lems and find effective solutions to them.
"But most importantly, we're looking for stu
dents who have had some practical work experi
ence received through a summer internship or a
comparable program," he said.
"Summer internships, for those who are inter
ested, should be easier to come by than in the past.
The aerospace industry is very attractive right now.
The industry as a whole is experiencing a boom and
McDonnell Douglas in particular is experiencing a
period of growth. Commercial and defense orders

have had a steady increase lately."
Growth in the industry means more jobs for col
lege students — Jones said that close to 700 posi
tions will be available at Douglas Aircraft this year.
Jones felt that the positions at McDonnell
Douglas offer something special for the engineers.
"The building of aircraft allows the close interac
tion of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers
and industrial engineers. ... You can be involved
in both the design and the practical application of
the aircraft."
Pamela Wilson, a senior in industrial engineer
ing, also felt that McDonnell Douglas had some
thing special to offer her. She is interested in the
Career Advancement Program (CAP). The Career
Advancement Program is a two-year program in
management training that allows the person to
work in several different areas of engineering. The
CAP aside, Pamela said she felt that McDonnell
Douglas was a good employer and she had received
positive feedback from friends already working in
Long Beach.
However, living in Long Beach can be expensive.
Fortunately, compensation in the aerospace indus
try is good, and one can expect to earn between
$26,000 and $29,000 with a bachelors degree and
between $30,000 and $32,000 with a masters. Ad
ditionally, one can expect merit increases after
working for there for a while.
Some people might not want to work for
McDonnell Douglas for ethical reasons. Jones an
swered this concern by saying, ' McDonnell
Douglas is known well enough that people are
usually aware of what they are getting themselves
into. Furthermore, Douglas Aircraft (half of
McDonnell Douglas) is mainly concerned with
commercial transport aircraft, rather than military
airplanes."
Jones pointed out that Douglas builds only one
airplane for the Defense Department in Long
Beach. McDonnell (the other half of the company),
which is more Defense Department oriented, is lo
cated in St. Louis and does not usually hire Stan
ford students.
