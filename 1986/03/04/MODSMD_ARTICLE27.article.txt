# How to get free flight insurance
## 
### KEN SAWYER Editorial staff 
While few students concern
themselves with their eventual
(albeit probably not imminent)
death, airplane flights somehow
cause many of us a little concern.
With spring break just a few weeks
away, many Stanford students are
making plans to fly somewhere —
the fortunate ones to Hawaii or
Europe, others to the East Coast
or down to Los Angeles, and an
unfortunate few to the Midwest.
Many students consider and a
few even buy flight insurance for
these trips. Twenty-two commer
cial airline disasters and the 1,419
resultant fatalities in 1985 have
caused renewed concern over the
safety of flying. The result? More
purchasers of flight insurance than
ever before.
Almost every student knows
that you are more likely to die in a
car wreck than to be killed in a
plane accident, and yet there are
still those who purchase these
policies. Why? Well, at $5, Mutual
of Omaha's $ 150,000 flight policy
may seem like a bargain.
However, assuming the entire
flight (plus trips to and from the
airport) lasts 10 hours, the an
nualized premium you'd be paying
is $4,380. That's over 16 times
what a local insurance agency

quoted me for a $150,000 policy
for a healthy 25-year-old.
What's more, as most college
students realize, who benefits if
they die? Mom and Dad? It's
supposed to work the other way
around. So who cares about flight
insurance? Why have I written this
article?
You see, flight insurance (or
more accurately 'travel insurance,'
since it covers car, bus and taxi
rides to and from the airport) is
free if you know how to get it.
Now you're interseted, eh?
Almost all credit card compan
ies give you free travel-accident
insurance if you buy your plane
ticket with their card. American
Express, for example, gives you a
$100,000 insurance policy free
when you buy a ticket with the
card you shouldn't leave home
without. If you don't have a card,
but Mom or Dad does, they can
buy your ticket and you will still be
covered (assuming you are still a
dependent and are under 23 years
of age).
American Express also offers,
although at an exorbitant fee, a $ 1
million policy for an extra $11 per
trip. However, I'd stick with the
free coverage if I were you. If you
think about it, the only way you'd
be able to cash in on that $1 mil
lion is to die — and then spending
it wouldn't be much fun.
