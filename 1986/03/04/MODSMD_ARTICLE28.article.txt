## Eagles plummet to earth at Sunken Diamond 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
So far this season, the only thing that has been consis
tent about the Stanford baseball team has been its incon
sistency.
It wasn't too surprising, then, that the No. 8 Cardinal
was tied in the seventh inning with Cal-State Los Angeles
a 4-10 Division II team. And it probably wasn't too
shocking that, after taking a 5-4 lead in the bottom of the
seventh, Stanford let the tying run get into scoring posi
tion in the ninth when reliever A 1 Osuna gave up a two
out, 0-2 double to pinch-hitter Chris Anderson.
But the Cardinal was able to avoid the upset, ending the

Golden Eagles' hopes when Osuna
induced Loy Mcßride to hit a first
pitch changeup to Mark Machtolf at
third, who threw to first for the
game's final out.
Although the win, which boosted
Stanford's record to 14-6, was by no
means one of the Cardinal's most im
pressive, it did come directly on the
heels of a physically and emotionally
draining weekend road trip to
Arizona, in which Stanford took two
of three games from the lOth-ranked
Wildcats.
"I don't think we played with the
intensity we could have today," said
shortstop Frank Carey, one of three
Cardinal players to collect two hits on
the day. "But they're a good team.
Give them some credit."
Indeed, the Golden Eagles do
deserve some credit. They committed
only one error, and pitcher Steve Poi
verini held the Cardinal offense to
only one run and four hits over the
final six innings, after being tagged

for three runs and four hits in the first two frames.
Stanford took a 1-0 lead in the first on an infield single
by Toi Cook and an RBI triple to right-center by Mark
Davis, then stretched that advantage to 3-0 in the second
on a throwing error by L. A. State first baseman Steve Nic
hols and an RBI single by Cook.
Meanwhile, Cardinal starter Jim Price was shackling the
Golden Eagles in the first start of his Stanford career. The
hard-throwing freshman right-hander, whose fastball has
been clocked at over 90 m.p.h., gave up only two hits in
the first three innings.
"My fastball had some pretty good pop in the early in
nings," Price said. "But about the fourth of fifth, I started
going to my curveball a little more."
The Golden Eagles nicked Price for a run in the fourth,

but the Cardinal got its three-run lead back in the fifth on
a booming RBI double to left-center by Doug Robbins.
In the sixth, after Mcßride led off with a single. Price
went to a 2-0 count on second baseman Donald Mengel.
This brought Stanford Coach Mark Marquess out of the
dugout to replace Price with left-hander Osuna.
"My legs felt pretty strong, but it was a tight situation,''
Price said. "The last thing he (Marquess) wanted to do
was to lose to a team like them, like we did against USF (a
2-1 loss on Feb. 25). He just wanted someone more expe
rienced like Al."
Osuna gave up a single to Mengel, then surrendered an
RBI single to Jeff Kimbro. Osuna escaped the inning
without further damage, but only because of a lunging

stab of a Steve Nichols line drive by
first baseman Lance Shebelut that
was turned into a double play.
Price lost his chance for his first
collegiate win in the seventh when,
after a leadoff single by James Lynch,
Shaun Doyle tagged Osuna for a two
run homer to right that tied the game
at four.
"The home run was a first-pitch
fastball up in his eyes," Osuna said.
"And he turned on it."
Stanford was able to come back
and score the game-winner in the
bottom of the inning. Carey singled,
but was forced at second by a Harris
fielder's choice. Harris moved to
second on a bunt by Cook, then
Davis bounced a single through the
hole to bring him around.
Osuna got the win, improving his
record to 4-1, but his four-inning,
eight-hit outing was typical of some
of the rough outings he has had over
the past few weeks. "My sliders been
just a little flat, so I've had to go to

the fastball more, which gives the hitters something to sit
on," he said.
The most positive aspects of the game for Stanford were
the performances of Price and the Cardinal defense,
which turned three double plays. "Our defense was very
good today," said Osuna, who started a slick 1-6-3 twin
killing to end the eighth inning. "If we play defense like
that, we'll win a lot more ballgames."
Another way to win a lot of ballgames is to schedule
them the way Stanford has been lately. Yesterday's game
was the eighth in the last 10 days for the Cardinal. Today,
Stanford will make it nine in 11 when it travels to San Jose
to take on San Jose State in a 2 p.m. contest.

Jim Price turned in a fine performance in his first Stanford start yesterday against Cal State-Los Angeles.
The big freshman left the game with a 4-1 lead, but a Golden Eagle rally kept him from getting the win.
