# Women advance to 13-14 on the year
## Hoopsters take another, surprise Gulls in Maples 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
The U.S. International Univer
sity Gulls had the record, the
players and an NCAA tournament
bid on the line.
This news, however, failed to
impress the Stanford women's bas
ketball team, which came away
with a surprising 79-71 victory last
night over the highly regarded
Gulls from San Diego.
Even though USIU had clinched
first place in the West Coast Ath
letic Conference with a 10-1
record, it was not assured of a
postseason tournament berth. Last
night's loss before 100 spectators at
Maples Pavilion reduced its
chances.
Stanford, now 13-14, has won
two consecutive games. A third
straight win in next Saturday's
season finale against Arizona
would give the Cardinal a .500
record, a far cry from last year's 9-
19 effort.
Stanford prevented the Lady
Gulls (22-7 overall), usually an of
fensively explosive ball club, from
establishing their patented run
and-gun arsenal led by prolific
scorer Toya DeCree.
"We were just trying to sprint
back (on defense), spot DeCree,
then set up the defense," Stanford
Asst. Coach Julie Plank said.
For the most part, the Cardinal
was able to contain the Gulls' run
ning game in the first half. But
USIU was still able to work the ball
inside to DeCree, who scored 15
points in the first stanza.
Even though the Gulls owned a
17-2 free throw advantage over
Stanford, they only led 40-38 at the
intermission due to the offensive
contributions of Cardinal standouts
Virginia Sourlis and Kami Ander
son. Scoring 10 and eight points
respectively. Sourlis and Anderson
mitigated USIU's blistering 68 per
cent shooting onslaught in the first
half.
While Anderson continued her
scoring spree, the Cardinal checked
DeCree by adjusting its zone
defense.
"We had our guards sag in so
that they were actually guarding
three positions — the two wings
and the high post,'' Plank said. "So
we always had a guard with her
(DeCree) when she was on top."
Anderson's basket off the glass
with over 19 minutes left to play

gave the Cardinal a 42-40 advan
tage. one that it would never relin
quish.
But after USIU backup center
Fiona Murray hit her second con
secutive inside shot off the glass
with a little over five minutes left,
the Lady Gulls were within two
points, 59-57.

Stanford needed some added of
fensive firepower, and it got it in
the form of 5-foot-5 guard Charli
Turner. The sophomore from Van
Nuys ignited a Cardinal offensive
rally with three critical outside
jumpers. Her third basket with
1:15 left in the game gave Stanford
an insurmountable 77-65 lead.
