# Students protest Saga at Coffee House
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Believing that "people should treat [the Coffee
House] as a community center." six students last
night brewed and drank coffee from a private cof
fee maker at the Coffee House.
Protesting last year's transfer of the Coffee
House from a student-run organization to an af
filiate of Saga food service, the students said they
wanted to "inspire a boycott" of the food and

beverages sold at the Coffee House.
Stanford post-doctoral candidate Lee Altenberg,
organizer of last night's boycott activity, said the
goal of the students' action was "to let people know
that they're free to use the community center as
they wish without being tied in with Saga.
"Its distasteful tor me to support Saga, which is
making profits off the students." Altenberg said,
adding that Tresidder Union has "drifted from its
original purpose, which is to serve the students."
Caroline Paul, a senior in economics who also

participated in the protest, said that as an educa
tional institution, Stanford seems to be "stilling the
educational aspect of a student-run organization"
such as that of the former student-run Coffee
House.
"If Tresidder Union's claim that this really isn't a
profit-making organization is true, then the Coffee
House shouldn't mind" students bringing their own
tocxl and beverages into the establishment, Paul
said.
Coffee House manager Jeff
Lougee, who arrived at the Coffee
House shortly after the students
started to make their own coffee,
said, "I don't see a problem with [the
students' actions] as long as the other
guests of the Coffee House are not
uncomfortable.
"I'm not going to condone it, but
(the students) have a message that
I'm certainly going to let them put
across," he said.

Although Lougee said he "can't
form an opinion' about the boycot
ting students' position on the issue, he
said, "I think it's good that students
are concerned, because I don't like
apathy."
Lougee confirmed that he told the
Coffee House's student manager
Maria Botte last night "to give (the
protesting students) styrofoam cups if
they want them."
"I'm happy to supply an area for
free speech," Lougee said, reiterating
that his first priority was still to
ensure that his paying customers
remain comfortable.

First-year medical student Jeff Jol
genson said the students boycotting
Saga "represent a segment of Stan
ford not served by the so-called com
munity center."
Altenberg agreed that "lots of
people have accepted Tresidder as
just a bunch of businesses, and this
'community center' has been washed
away by Tresidder's way of running
things."
Altenberg stressed that the boycot
ters did not intend to undercut Saga's
business in any way, but wanted to es
tablish the Coffee House as a com
munity center.
