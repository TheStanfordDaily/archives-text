# Students protest Saga at Coffee House
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Believing that "people should treat [the Coffee
House] as a community center." six students last
night brewed and drank coffee from a private cof
fee maker at the Coffee House.
Protesting last year's transfer of the Coffee
House from a student-run organization to an af
filiate of Saga food service, the students said they
wanted to "inspire a boycott" of the food and

beverages sold at the Coffee House.
Stanford post-doctoral candidate Lee Altenberg,
organizer of last night's boycott activity, said the
goal of the students' action was "to let people know
that they're free to use the community center as
they wish without being tied in with Saga.
"Its distasteful tor me to support Saga, which is
making profits off the students." Altenberg said,
adding that Tresidder Union has "drifted from its
original purpose, which is to serve the students."
Caroline Paul, a senior in economics who also

participated in the protest, said that as an educa
tional institution, Stanford seems to be "stilling the
educational aspect of a student-run organization"
such as that of the former student-run Coffee
House.
"If Tresidder Union's claim that this really isn't a
profit-making organization is true, then the Coffee
House shouldn't mind" students bringing their own
tocxl and beverages into the establishment, Paul
said.
