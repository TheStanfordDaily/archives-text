# Cagers primed for future
## 
### 
Can it be March already? It seemed
we were just beginning the Pacific 10
Conference basketball season, and
now we're just a week away from it
all being over.
Sure, a couple of Pac-10 teams —
Arizona and Washington — are going
to the NCAA's annual postseason
party, and a couple more — Califor
nia and UCLA — have decent shots
of being in the National Invitational
Tournament.
But for Stanford, dreams of tour
naments must wait another year —
the season comes to a close this Sat
urday in Pullman, Wash.
It's been an exciting season,
though. More exciting than it should
have been, perhaps. When you lose
your best guard and your best power
forward, and have to rely on a couple
of freshmen to carry you through the
season, you shouldn't have ever had a
chance to even whisper the words
"postseason tournament" in public.
Stanford certainly surprised the
coaches around the Pac-10, who
picked the Cardinal to finish ninth
this season. Going into Thursday's
game at Washington, Stanford is 8-8
in the league and tied for fifth place.
And when you take into account
the loss of Steve Brown and Earl
Koberlein, scratching up to .500 is an
accomplishment of note. Koberlein
was the Cardinal's leading returning
scorer from last year, and Brown was
the top scorer returning from the year
before, after having redshirted last
season.
Their contributions were short
lived. Brown's stress fracture never

really healed, and he didn't even play
in a conference game. Koberlein suf
fered a freak knee injury in the Card
inal's fifth Pac-10 game.
The emergence of Todd Lichti cer
tainly helped matters. Over the sum
mer, you kept hearing about this in
coming freshman from Concord who
was a real player. Come November,
you found out the stories were true.
Lichti has not only averaged 17
points in conference games, he has
added a new dimension by being cre
ative. A good, patient half-court of
fense can't hurt a team, but Lichti is
able to work outside it when neces
sary.

Howard Wright, the other fresh
man in the lineup, has lent stability at
the center position. Wright has been
inconsistent at times, but for the most
part has given the Cardinal an inside
game equal to that of most teams in
the league. Granted, it's been a down
year in that department in the Pac
-10, but there seems to be no reason
why Wright won't continue to im
prove.
The inexperience of this team has
shown at times, though. A few too
many times to enable it to pull off the
tournament berth this season.

When you start two freshmen and a
sophomore for most of the season, it's
going to happen. Stanford Coach
Tom Davis has referred to his young
team being intimidated on the road
and trying too hard to impress the
home crowd.
The result has been losses that
shouldn't have happened and that ul
timately have caused this team to be
watching the tournaments later this
month. One loss came against
Arizona State, when Stanford blew
an eight-point lead in the final two
minutes and then saw Lichti, of all
people, miss three free throws in
overtime.
There was one to Oregon, the
worst team in the league, when the
Cardinal was scheduled to play its
third game in five days and didn't
show up. And there was the one
Thursday to Oregon State when the
same thing happened. And all came
at home.
Yes, this team had its chances and
didn't win the games when it needed
to. Maybe it was just a case of a team
playing over its head before finally
coming back to earth. But you've got
to like what the future has in store.
The same team that played most of
the season loses only three seniors.
Point guard Keith Ramee will be the
toughest to replace, especially if
backup John Paye elects to play in the
football senior all-star games instead
of basketball next year. Hopefully,
Terry Taylor can take the place of the
all-time Stanford assist leader.

Andy Fischer look a good deal of
athletic ability and a good deal more
hustle from the gray team to the start
ing lineup, but by the end of the year
Lichti and Novian Whitsitt were
seeing most of the playing time. And
Neil Johnson surprised everyone by
contributing off the bench instead of
running scout team — he is the kind
of worker Davis always seems to find.
But before next year gets here,
there remains the goal of a winning
season this year. Beating Washington
in Seattle on Thursday will be a diffi
cult task, but it is certainly a possibil
ity.
An apology
A couple weeks ago I got carried
away in this column and mis
represented the views of Jim Colton,
Steve Raczynski and David Fisher
toward the basketball fans at
Arizona, saying they viewed the
Arizona boosters as obnoxious.
"Boisterous, loud and intimidat
ing," yes. "Obnoxious," no. My
apologies to all.

this season. Going into Thursday's
game at Washington, Stanford is 8-8
in the league and tied for fifth place.
And when you take into account
the loss of Steve Brown and Earl
Koberlein, scratching up to .500 is an
accomplishment of note. Koberlein
was the Cardinal's leading returning
scorer from last year, and Brown was
the top scorer returning from the year
before, after having redshirted last
season.
Their contributions were short
lived. Brown's stress fracture never

really healed, and he didn't even play
in a conference game. Koberlein suf
fered a freak knee injury in the Card
inal's fifth Pac-10 game.
The emergence of Todd Lichti cer
tainly helped matters. Over the sum
mer, you kept hearing about this in
coming freshman from Concord who
was a real player. Come November,
you found out the stories were true.
Lichti has not only averaged 17
points in conference games, he has
added a new dimension by being cre
ative. A good, patient half-court of
fense can't hurt a team, but Lichti is
able to work outside it when neces
sary.

Howard Wright, the other fresh
man in the lineup, has lent stability at
the center position. Wright has been
inconsistent at times, but for the most
part has given the Cardinal an inside
game equal to that of most teams in
the league. Granted, it's been a down
year in that department in the Pac
-10, but there seems to be no reason
why Wright won't continue to im
prove.
The inexperience of this team has
shown at times, though. A few too
many times to enable it to pull off the
tournament berth this season.

When you start two freshmen and a
sophomore for most of the season, it's
going to happen. Stanford Coach
Tom Davis has referred to his young
team being intimidated on the road
and trying too hard to impress the
home crowd.
The result has been losses that
shouldn't have happened and that ul
timately have caused this team to be
watching the tournaments later this
month. One loss came against
Arizona State, when Stanford blew
an eight-point lead in the final two
minutes and then saw Lichti, of all
people, miss three free throws in
overtime.
There was one to Oregon, the
worst team in the league, when the
Cardinal was scheduled to play its
third game in five days and didn't
show up. And there was the one
Thursday to Oregon State when the
same thing happened. And all came
at home.
Yes, this team had its chances and
didn't win the games when it needed
to. Maybe it was just a case of a team
playing over its head before finally
coming back to earth. But you've got
to like what the future has in store.
The same team that played most of
the season loses only three seniors.
Point guard Keith Ramee will be the
toughest to replace, especially if
backup John Paye elects to play in the
football senior all-star games instead
of basketball next year. Hopefully,
Terry Taylor can take the place of the
all-time Stanford assist leader.

Andy Fischer look a good deal of
athletic ability and a good deal more
hustle from the gray team to the start
ing lineup, but by the end of the year
Lichti and Novian Whitsitt were
seeing most of the playing time. And
Neil Johnson surprised everyone by
contributing off the bench instead of
running scout team — he is the kind
of worker Davis always seems to find.
But before next year gets here,
there remains the goal of a winning
season this year. Beating Washington
in Seattle on Thursday will be a diffi
cult task, but it is certainly a possibil
ity.
An apology
A couple weeks ago I got carried
away in this column and mis
represented the views of Jim Colton,
Steve Raczynski and David Fisher
toward the basketball fans at
Arizona, saying they viewed the
Arizona boosters as obnoxious.
"Boisterous, loud and intimidat
ing," yes. "Obnoxious," no. My
apologies to all.
Can it be March already? It seemed
we were just beginning the Pacific 10
Conference basketball season, and
now we're just a week away from it
all being over.
Sure, a couple of Pac-10 teams —
Arizona and Washington — are going
to the NCAA's annual postseason
party, and a couple more — Califor
nia and UCLA — have decent shots
of being in the National Invitational
Tournament.
But for Stanford, dreams of tour
naments must wait another year —
the season comes to a close this Sat
urday in Pullman, Wash.
It's been an exciting season,
though. More exciting than it should
have been, perhaps. When you lose
your best guard and your best power
forward, and have to rely on a couple
of freshmen to carry you through the
season, you shouldn't have ever had a
chance to even whisper the words
"postseason tournament" in public.
Stanford certainly surprised the
