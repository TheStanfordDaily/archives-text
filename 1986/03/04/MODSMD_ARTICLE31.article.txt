# Inexperienced Spartans could challenge Stanford in rematch
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Intimidation only lasts for so long. Exactly one month
ago the Stanford men's tennis team opened up its season
by defeating a young San Jose State squad, 7-2, and some
of the Spartan players were a bit awed by playing the No.
I -ranked team in the country.
"I think last time, with all their new guys, they were in
timidated," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"Yeah, 1 think that was the case," San Jose State Coach
John Hubbell agreed. "My freshman and JC (junior col
lege transfers) weren't used to playing big time college
tennis yet."
This afternoon the Spartans will get another swing at
the Cardinal when they visit Stanford's varsity courts for a
1:30 p.m. rematch.
This time, both coaches expect the match to be con
siderably different.
"I doubt they (San Jose) will be fazed at all." Gould
said. "Look for a tougher match this time."
Again, Hubbell concurred. "1 think we played reason
ably well last time — every match except McEnroe's (he
defeated Marcello Telia 6-1, 6-2) was respectable. So I'm
hopeful that we'll do better this time."
Today's match marks Stanford senior Jim Grabb's
return to singles play. Grabb, who has been hampered by

a groin injury, has only played doubles so far this season.
Grabb will probably take the place of Cardinal Dan
Goldie, the No. 1-ranked player in the nation. Goldie will
sit out singles play for a couple of reasons.
"Dan's missed a lot of (school) work due to tourna
ments, plus I want to give Mark (Jacobson) as many
matches as I can," Gould said. If Goldie played, he would
bump Jacobson out of the top six.
Stanford's lineup today should be the following: Grabb
will play No. I singles, followed by sophomore Patrick
McEnroe, seniors Eric Rosenfeld and John Letts, and
then juniors Scott Moody and Jacobson in the fifth and
sixth spots.
The Cardinal will have its regular doubles combos, with
Goldie and Grabb at No. I, Letts and McEnroe at No. 2,
and Rosenfeld and Moody at No. 3.
San Jose State will be missing its No. 2 player. Nelson
Banes, who is having academic problems. Otherwise the
Spartans will be bringing the same young lineup to the
Farm.
Freshman Malcolm Allen will be playing No. 1, and
he'll be followed by Mark Murphy, transfer Marcello
Telia, Bob Hepner, frosh Tom Sheehan and Psul
Carbone.
In doubles. Murphy and Carbone will team up at Ihe
first spot. Hepner and Allen will play second and Telia
and Layne Lyssy will fill the third spot.
