Water polo
Following the NCAA champion men's
lead, the Stanford women's water polo team
opened the 1986 season with a first-place
finish in the UC-Davis Invitational last
weekend. The Cardinal won four times and
tied once in the tournament.
In the first game against UC-Santa Bar
bara, Stanford, the 1985 national champion,
scored nine unanswered goals. Hole-setter
Jill Palmer's five tallies fueled the surge, and
Karen Doctor was flawless in goal.
The Cardinal then went on to defeat
Chico State by a score of 14-2 and drop Cal
ifornia, 9-4.
In the final game of the tournament, Stan
ford faced its toughest competition yet â€”
UC-Davis. Taking advantage of the Card
inal's strong offense, senior Lorna Thorton
dominated the game with her powerful
drives and scored four of the team's seven
goals.
After three quarters of fierce competition,
Stanford was down by one goal with one
minute of play left. A decisive shot off the
counterattack by Madeleine Maillet tied the
score in the last 20 seconds of the game.
Very pleased with this weekend's perfor
mance, the team is now looking forward to
the stiff competition at the Santa Barbara
Open next weekend.
Ice hockey
The Belmont Bums played more like
kings as they downed the Stanford ice
hockey team 8-0 Sunday night.
The Cardinal, which is in the midst of a
long losing streak and has been crippled by
injuries, could only muster a nine-man
squad for the game.
Belmont got all the scoring it needed in
the first period, when it jumped out to a 3-0
lead. The Bums stretched their lead to five
after two stanzas and notched three more
goals in the third to account for the final 8-0
verdict.
Polo
. It's off to Darien, Ct., and next week's
NCAA tournament for the men's horse polo
team that finished second in the West Coast

Regional Playoffs last weekend at UC-
Davis. The Cardinal tied the host Aggies
and beat USC.
The Stanford squad, which consisted of
senior Jack Fox, junior Feisal Khan, sopho
more Igor Aguirre and alternate Sharoni
Shafir, was up against some stiff competition
in playing Davis, the five-time national
champions.
The tournament was also held in an arena,
which handicapped the Cardinal, a team
used to playing outdoors.
The regional was set up in a round-robin
format to eliminate one team and permit the
other two to go to nationals. In the first
match, Stanford battled it out in what
proved to be one of the most exciting games
of the year.
Aguirre led the scoring with four goals
and Fox slammed in one. The Aggies,
however, were able to score in the last min
ute to leave the game in a 5-5 tie.
In the Cardinal's second game, USC fell
prey to Stanford after exceptionally long
chukkers which were delayed by injuries
and penalties.
Khan was ridden into the boards and sub
sequently fell off his horse and landed on his
head and back.
"It was without question the most physi
cal game I've ever seen," Fox said.
"We should have beaten them by more,
but we were exhausted from the game
against Davis," Aguirre said.
Stanford placed second in the tourna
ment, as Davis won by a larger margin over
USC, but the Cardinal nonetheless qualified
for the NCAAs.
The squad will travel to Darien this Satur
day to compete against East Coast powers
Cornell, Connecticut, Yale and Dartmouth.
Stanford finished sixth in the nation last year
and is looking for a top-three finish this time
around.
Women's lacrosse
After dominating Claremont and UC-San
Diego, the Stanford women's lacrosse A
team narrowly lost to powerful Orange
County 6-4 to finish 2-1 last weekend at
Claremont.
Michelle Janin scored six goals against
Claremont as the Cardinal romped to a 14-1
victory. UCSD fell next to the Stanford at
tack, 11-5.

The Cardinal almost pulled off a sweep,
playing Orange County very closely.
Everybody played well, according to captain
Justina Ray, and the defense, led by Jennifer
Porges and Lisa Stewart, was especially
tough.
The Cardinal B team went 1-2 on the
weekend, losing 8-6 to Claremont and split
ting with Santa Barbara. Susan Slusser had
an unusually strong performance in the
Cardinal s loss to Claremont, scoring three
goals.
The explosive Slusser led the B team with
four goals for the weekend. Edith Pepper
and Sara Wolf each tallied three goals, fol
lowed by Lisa Beattie with two.
Men's rugby
A strong second-half Cardinal surge fell
short as the California men's rugby team
held on to defeat Stanford 26-15 Saturday
at Berkeley.
The Cardinal fell to 7-6 overall and 2-3 in
league play.
Cal's forwards dominated the first half,
leading the Bears to a decisive 23-3 halftime
margin. Stanford's only first-half points
came on a penalty kick by Andy MacTavish.
The Cardinal forwards stabilized in the
second half, and the Bears were only able to
score one penalty field goal. Despite tries by
MacTavish and Finstein and successful con
versions by MacTavish, the Cardinal was
unable to catch the Bears.
Badminton
Two-time defending champion Joy
Kitzmiller of Stanford was upset by Arizona
State's Nina Lolk 11-3, 11-7 last weekend in
the women's singles finals of the Collegiate
National Badminton Championships at
Philadelphia's Bryn Mawr College.
Kitzmiller and Elaine Teoh combined to
reach the semifinals of the doubles cham
pionships before losing.
In the men's competition, Benji Wincure
advanced to the quarterfinals in singles and
teamed with Joe Pinter to reach the semi
finals of the doubles.
"We didn't do as well as last year, but we
didn't have as many people there," Kitzmil
ler said. "Joe and Elaine did exceptionally
well."
