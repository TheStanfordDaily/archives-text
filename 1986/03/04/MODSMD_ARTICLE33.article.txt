# Sailors win regatta
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
Increasing its winning streak to
three regattas, the Stanford sailing
team upset some of the best teams in
California to win the South Series
Four by a comfortable margin this
weekend in Santa Barbara.
Though it won the regatta, beating
highly-ranked USC and UC-Irvine in
the process, Stanford Coach Joe
Petrucci wasn't altogether satisfied
that his team had performed at its
best.
"We beat them pretty handily,"
Petrucci said. "We sailed reasonably
well. Just well enough to win."
The Stanford team had some prob
lems dealing with the light air condi
tions that marred the regatta and
caused the cancellation of races
planned on Saturday. But Stanford
capitalized on an unfortunate break
for the USC team when the Trojans'
top sailor, former Olympian John
Shadden, was disqualified in the third
race, and the Cardinal's problems
weren't reflected in the final score.

"The weaknesses we had really
came out in the light air," Petrueci
said. "We were a little bit timid at
times, especially at the starting line.
We have to mix it up and engage
these people. Those lessons are easily
taught on the board but applications
are harder. This regatta was really a
stepping stone for qualifiers and na
tionals."
In the A-division, Stanford's Rich
Bergsend and Marika Fussganger
took first with 13 points while Dan
Buckstaff and Suzi Pritchett took top
honors in the B-division with 20
points. Their combined score of 33
was enough to capture first place
ahead of UCLA with 37, USC with
44 and UC-Irvine with 50.
The victory should boost the Card
inal from its current No. 12 ranking
to a spot in the top 10. Rankings
shouldn't be taken too seriously at
this time, however, according to
Petrucci.
"Rankings don't really bear on
who goes to qualifiers or nationals.
They are just a marker," he said.
