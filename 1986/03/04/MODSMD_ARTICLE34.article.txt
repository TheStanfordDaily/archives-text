### PETER CASTILLO Staff writer 
In a surprising finish for a squad forfeiting two
weight classes and expecting to finish last, the Stanford
wrestling team eked out a third-place finish in the
Pacific 10 Conference championships in Pullman,
Wash, on Sunday.
The Cardinal wrestlers turned in stellar perfor
mances in the climb to third place and also qualified
three wrestlers to compete in the NCAA champion
ships.
"I am happy with the team's performance, as every
one did as well as they could have. We did everything
that I was hoping for," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said. "I am surprised because I expected Oregon and
Washington State to be tougher."
Making the trip to lowa City will be seniors Jeff
Bradley (134 pounds) and Pete Rogers (158 pounds)
and sophomore Dave Lee (167 pounds).
Arizona State captured the team title by edging out
Oregon State, 86.5 to 80.5. In the battle for third
place, only a point and a half separated the third and
fifth-place teams. Stanford had 46.5 points, Washing
ton State 45.25 and Oregon 45.
Bradley opened up the defense of his Pac-10 title by

beating Ted Parker of Washington State, 9-6, in a
tough match.
In the finals, Bradley met Oregon's Glenn Jarrett,
who captured the 126-pound title last year. Though
the match was close, Bradley was in control throughout
the contest for a 6-4 victory.
Lee began the defense of his tjtle by pinning Arizona
State's Don Frye at the 4:51 mark. Lee then crushed
Dan Martin of Oregon, 11-1, to get into the finals.
Pat Gibson of Oregon State held a 4-3 lead over Lee
with 1:05 left in the match, when Lee scored an escape
to tie the match. With 18 seconds remaining, Lee got a
takedown to take the lead 6-4. Gibson scored an
escape at the buzzer, but it was too late, as Lee won, 6-
5.
Rogers' 158-pound weight class was probably the
toughest category in the Pac-10 championships.
Rogers lost to the eventual champion, Marvin Seals of
Oregon State, 7-1. He then rebounded to convincingly
beat Scott Cook of Washington State, 12-5, for third
place.
Rogers got one of the three NCAA wild card bids
based on the strength of his division. He also gave
Seals a better match than Arizona State's Jim Gressley
in the finals, and compiled a good season record.
