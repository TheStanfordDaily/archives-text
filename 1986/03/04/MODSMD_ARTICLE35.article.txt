Funeral for slain West Bank mayor
NABLUS, Israeli-Occupied West Bank — A massive funeral proces
sion for assassinated Nablus Mayor Zafir Masri yesterday turned into
the largest Arab nationalist demonstration ever held in the West Bank,
which Israel has occupied since 1967. Mourners defiantly waved banned
Palestinian flags and chanted slogans in support of the outlawed
Palestine Liberation Organization.
Masri's body, shrouded in a Palestinian flag, was borne for more than
two hours in a circuitous, noisy parade through virtually every major
street of Nablus before being buried in a martyr's place of honor in front
of the city's principal mosque.
At the height of the procession, an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 dem
onstrators filled the city's central business section — a turnout unmatched
during a 19-year period of martial law in which demonstrations, for the
most part, have been prohibited by the Israeli occupation authorities.
Before 1967, when the West Bank was under Jordanian administra
tion, such demonstrations were also prohibited by Jordanian security
forces.
Masri, who since his appointment as mayor in December had become
a symbol of Israeli efforts to revive Middle East peace talks by enhanc
ing self-rule among moderate Palestinians, was shot to death by an uni
dentified gunman in front of his office Sunday. Two Syrian-backed radi
cal PLO splinter groups have said that they carried out the assassination.
Police kill seven black guerrillas
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Seven suspected black guerrillas
were shot to death yesterday by South African police in a fierce gun bat
tle outside Cape Town, the latest in a series of clashes that are bringing
the black nationalists' armed insurgency into urban areas.
Gen. Johan Coetzee, the national police commissioner, said that his
men, acting on a tip, had thwarted a planned attack on a dozen black
police officers by guerrillas of the African National Congress. He said his
men ambushed the guerrillas.
Coetzee said that the guerrillas, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, pis
tols and grenades, had been following a police van picking up the black
officers in Guguletu, a black ghetto township outside Cape Town, and
were about to attack it when other policemen, who had been lying in
wait for four hours, halted their vehicle and, after a grenade was thrown,
opened fire.
Four guerrillas were shot dead in the Five-minute fusillade, according
to the police, and three more were chased into the surrounding brush
and killed in gun battles. Witnesses told reporters that one guerrilla had
been killed while trying to surrender and that another, wounded and
writhing on the ground, had been "finished off' by a white police officer.
Police spokesmen strongly denied the allegations.
Two policemen were slightly injured, one by grenade fragments and
the other by flying glass.
Had the guerrillas succeeded, the Guguletu attack would have been
one of the boldest in 25 years of armed struggle against the apartheid
system of racial segregation and minority white rule. They would have
killed, within 10 miles of the center of Cape Town, a dozen black
policemen regarded*as traitors to the nationalist cause.
Succesor to aim for Palme's goals
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — Acting Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson pledged yesterday to conduct an active foreign policy in line
with the goals set by his predecessor, Olof Palme, who was assassinated
last Friday night on a Stockholm street.
"No individual will be able to do exactly what Olof Palme did in the
international field," Carlsson said at his first formal meeting with foreign
journalists since taking over the government.
But, he added, "Olof Palme's work will not disappear with Olof
Palme."
Sweden and the Social Democratic Party that Palme headed will con
tinue "to stand up for the right of the small- and medium-sized countries
to have a say," Carlsson said.
Carlsson made the remarks as police investigating Palme's assassina
tion searched for clues to the identity of the killer, his motive and
whether he has links to an extremist political organization or terrorist
group.
The search centered on what is thus far the most significant publically
knownclue, the .357 magnum bullets used to kill Palme that were capa
ble of piercing a bullet-proof vest. Police said they have identified the
manufacturer of the bullets, but would not disclose the name of the com
pany.
Police believe that the use of such bullets is an indication that the kil
ler may have has professional knowledge of weaponry. But they also
showed that the assassin was apparently unaware that the slain Swedish
leader reportedly never wore a bullet-proof vest.
Several hours after the assassination became public, a news agency in
London received an anonymous telephone call from an individual who
asserted that the killing was carried out by the "Holger Meinz Com
mando Group" of West Germany.
Brezhnev blamed for slow economy
MOSCOW — Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov yesterday blamed the late
President Leonid Brezhnev for tolerating economic stagnation, and he
outlined a 15-year plan to restore growth.
Ryzhkov, in a speech to the 27th Congress of the Soviet Communist
Party, promised industrial workers wage increases averaging more than
25 percent over the next five years in order to spur the output of higher
quality goods.
The Soviet economy will expand by 5 percent a year, he predicted, t
compared with 3.1 percent under the previous plan, which covered five
years. 1
Harder work, better management and greater use of automation will
help to put the industrial machine into high gear, Ryzhkov said.
In the Kremlin tradition of assigning blame to predecessors, Ryzhkov
said the economy went into a tailspin for several years before Brezhnev's
death at the end of 1982. He did not mention Brezhnev by name, but the
reference was clear.
"The unfavorable tendencies that surfaced in economic development
during the 1970s grew sharper in the early 1980s," he said. "The quality
indicators of economic management deteriorated."
Iraq suffers heavy losses in war
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Despite Iraq's daily claims of success in its war
with Iran, evidence is mounting here that the Iraqi army has been
severely bloodied in recent weeks in trying to retake the Faw peninsula
at the head of the Persian Gulf.
Western military observers monitoring the five-and-one-half-year-old
war say they believe that the Iraqi army has suffered close to 10,000
casualties — dead and wounded — since Iran overran Faw on Feb. 9 in a
surprise amphibious and helicopter-borne attack on the marshy penin
sula that, before the war. housed Iraq's main oil-loading port.
As a result of the high casualties, the Western observers say, the gov
ernment of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein apparently has quietly
decided not to attempt to retake Faw because the cost in manpower
would be too great, politically and militarily.
At the same time, Iraq also has to deal with new Iranian offensives in
'the Howeizeh marshes north of Basra and in the Kurdish region of
northeastern Iraq.
Besides the reported 10,000 casualties — almost twice as many as Iraq
suffered during Iran's last major offensive, in the Howeizeh marshes last
year — Iran also apparently has inflicted a severe defeat on Iraq's crack
Republican Guards, the nation's strategic reserve that was sent in to lead
the counterattack.
