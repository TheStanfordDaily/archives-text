# Marcos' party backs Aquino

### 
MANILA, Philippines — Facing a political crisis
that has thrown the machinery of national and local
government into chaos throughout the country, the
remnants of Ferdinand Marcos' political party yes
terday extended a qualified hand of support to
President Corazon Aquino.
In an "emotionally charged" party caucus that
took place after Marcos personally telephoned his
party leaders from exile in Hawaii yesterday, the
political loyalists Marcos left behind pledged that
they would "try to assist and help" Aquino in
legitimizing her mandate as president, provided she
does not immediately ax all 1,519 largely Marcos
backed town mayors, some of whom physically bar
ricaded themselves inside their offices yesterday.
Aquino's defense minister, Juan Ponce Enrile,
who is still a member of Marcos' party, was
noticeably absent from yesterday's caucus, a sign of
his pledge to remain nonpartisan.
But just before the caucus ended, Enrile, who led
the military revolt that hastened Marcos' departure

last week, called and conveyed a promise by
Aquino to allow all local officials to remain in of
fice at least until June 30. The announcement
brought a loud cheer from the party members.
At the heart of the crisis is uncertainty over just
what kind of government Aquino now heads — a
constitutional government that will obey the
dictates of the nation's 1973 Marcos-amended con
stitution or a revolutionary government in which
Aquino would have the absolute power to dissolve
the National Assembly and the Supreme Court,
both currently dominated by Marcos loyalists.
Technically, Marcos defeated Aquino by 1.5 mil
lion votes in the Feb. 7 election. He was duly sworn
into office just a few hours before he fled the
country.
Aquino, however, claims that Marcos rigged the
returns, and she too was proclaimed president
hours before Marcos left the country, but the cere
mony took place in a suburban country club and

was not constitutionally proper.
Nonetheless, Aquino, 53, is recognized as the
undisputed leader of the Philippines by the nation
and the world. Not even the leaders of Marcos
New Society Movement party disputed that.
Rather, the purpose of their caucus was an attempt
to preserve as much power as they can amid threats
by factions within the Aquino government to try to
take power on every level of government.
"The Aquino government in power today is
already uncontested and has won the acceptance ot
the people," said former Labor Minister Bias Ople,
who was Marcos' top campaign aide and a key sup
porter of Marcos in the assembly. "I certainly do
not believe there is any government in exile outside
the Philippines.
At a press conference yesterday afternoon.
Aquino's vice president, Salvador "Doy" Laurel,
called for immediate action on forming a new con
stitution, which he said could be drafted in 90 days.
