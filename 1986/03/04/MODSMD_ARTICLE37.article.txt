# Congress considers tax amnesty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Leaders of the
Senate and House Budget commit
tees, groping for ways to raise reve
nue without increasing taxes, are
seriously exploring national amnesty
for payment of back taxes in order to
reduce budget deficits.
In the Senate, Budget Committee
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.)
has listed tax amnesty as a leading op
tion for inclusion in a package of $ 12
billion to $20 billion in revenue in
creases that would help meet the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
target of $ 144 billion for next year.
In the House, five members of the
Budget Committee are cosponsors of
tax-amnesty legislation that was in
troduced late last week.
"People want to raise revenues but

don't want to raise taxes," Domenici
said. "Tax amnesty fits that very
nicely."
Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.),
an amnesty sponsor in the House,
made the same point and added, "I
think it's going to be taken seriously."
The push for tax amnesty, under
which delinquent taxpayers would
pay back taxes and interest in ex
change for immunity from fines and
penalties, was inspired in large part
by the success of amnesty programs in
18 states.
But experts question whether a
federal amnesty would succeed as
well as some of these state efforts,
and even proponents concede that
the one-year infusion of back taxes is
more of a one-shot contribution to an

immediate deficit reduction than a
long-term answer to the country's fis
cal needs.
Tax amnesty is one of nine options,
worth a total of about $70 billion in
new revenues, that the Senate Budget
Committee will consider as it opens
drafting sessions for a fiscal 1987
budget resolution tomorrow. It ex
pects to select options that produce
new revenue of $ 12 billion to $20 bil
lion.
The amnesty proposal is calculated
by the budget panel staff to raise $8.6
billion next year. Estimates on how
much revenue amnesty would raise
range from $7 billion to $12 billion,
with some of that resulting from
strengthened compliance that would

accompany amnesty. Budget experts
acknowledge that the estimates are
very rough.
Other proposals on the Senate list
are relatively modest revenue
measures from President Reagan in
his fiscal 1987 budget, a gasoline tax
increase, an oil-import fee, an in
crease in wine and beer taxes, new
cigarette tax increases, a ceiling on
tax-free treatment of health benefits,
reduction in tax preferences and par
tial taxation of Social Security
benefits.
However Domenici, who is faced
with opposition from Reagan and
House Democrats to tampering with
Social Security benefits, plans to
strike the Social Security tax proposal
from the committee's options list.
