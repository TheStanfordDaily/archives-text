Reagan wants Contra aid
WASHINGTON — With a critical congres
sional vote just two weeks away. President
Reagan escalated his rhetoric yesterday in an ef
fort to gain support for his $ 100 million aid pack
age for Nicaraguan rebels.
With three rebel leaders at his side, Reagan
told a group of conservative supporters in the
Cabinet Room that defeat for the contras would
create "a privileged sanctuary for terrorists and
subversives just two days driving time from Har
lingen, Texas."
In a briefing for reporters, Elliot Abrams, as
sistant secretary for inter-American affairs, said
that thousands of disaffected Nicaraguans,
known as contras, were "standing around waiting
to fight" if the United States would equip them
against the "technological gap" produced by an
infusion of sophisticated Soviet weaponry.
Abrams asserted that the contra force, which
numbers 6,000, would swell to 25,000 if
Reagan's aid package were approved. He said
that the number of combatants had declined by
about 2,000 in recent months because of the lack
of supplies.
"If we don't provide our friends with the
means to stop the Soviet gunships, Nicaragua's
freedom fighters will suffer the same fate as the
Hungarian freedom fighters did 30 years ago,"
Reagan said.
The president faces a skeptical Congress as he
seeks to broaden U.S. involvement with the con
tras to include substantial military aid, particu
larly because only a third of the humanitarian aid
voted last year has actually gotten through to the
combatants in the field.
Reagan is asking Congress for $30 million in
humanitarian aid and $70 million in covert mili
tary assistance.

The House is expected to vote on Reagan's re
quest March 19. However, of the four House
committees reviewing the package, only the
Armed Services Committee is expected to vote
for it.
Panel urges drug tests
WASHINGTON — The President's Commis
sion on Organized Crime urged yesterday that all
federal employees and government contractors
be required to take tests for drug use or risk
being fired.
In a 455-page report to President Reagan on
drug use in America, compiled over two-and
one-half years, the commission also suggested
that the military take on an increased drug
enforcement role, and that the National Security
Agency set up an information system to be
shared by all drug-fighting agencies.
The commission also suggested that state and
local agencies and private employers consider
drug testing.
Warning that individuals who take drugs
should not be "packing parachutes or building
airplanes," Rodney Smith, the commission's dep
uty executive director, said, "If you want to work
in a sensitive job and get money from the govern
ment, you ought to be drug-free. .. . The notion
that it is okay to use a little drugs on a sport basis
is at the heart of our problem."
Allan Adler, legislative counsel of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, called the drug-testing
recommendation "very irresponsible" and an
"unwarranted invasion of the privacy of millions
of workers."
"It raises very serious Fourth Amendment is
sues (concerning) the right to be protected
against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Court to decide veto use
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
moving to resolve a constitutional impasse be
tween the Reagan Administration and members
of Congress, said yesterday that it would decide
when the president can exercise a "pocket veto"
to kill legislation he opposes.
The justices will hear a Department of Justice
appeal of a lower-court ruling that found that
President Reagan illegally used the historic
device to invalidate a bill Congress passed in
1983 conditioning aid to El Salvador on progress
in human rights.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled
that the president could use the pocket veto only
when Congress adjourns every two years for
elections and not during other recesses. Begin
ning with President Jefferson, 27 presidents have
exercised the pocket veto more than 200 times
during vacations or recesses between sessions of
the same Congress, according to the Department
of Justice.
Dow drops below 1,700
NEW YORK — The stock market retreated
yesterday, yielding to sellers who pushed the
Dow Jones industrial average back below the
1,700 level it surmounted for the first time last
week.
The drop, which came despite another day of
extraordinary strength in the bond market, was
attributed to profit-taking rather than any signifi
cant change in the news background.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 12.39 to 1,696.67.

lingen, Texas."
In a briefing for reporters, Elliot Abrams, as
sistant secretary for inter-American affairs, said
that thousands of disaffected Nicaraguans,
known as contras, were "standing around waiting
to fight" if the United States would equip them
against the "technological gap" produced by an
infusion of sophisticated Soviet weaponry.
Abrams asserted that the contra force, which
numbers 6,000, would swell to 25,000 if
Reagan's aid package were approved. He said
that the number of combatants had declined by
about 2,000 in recent months because of the lack
of supplies.
"If we don't provide our friends with the
means to stop the Soviet gunships, Nicaragua's
freedom fighters will suffer the same fate as the
Hungarian freedom fighters did 30 years ago,"
Reagan said.
The president faces a skeptical Congress as he
seeks to broaden U.S. involvement with the con
tras to include substantial military aid, particu
larly because only a third of the humanitarian aid
voted last year has actually gotten through to the
combatants in the field.
Reagan is asking Congress for $30 million in
humanitarian aid and $70 million in covert mili
tary assistance.

The House is expected to vote on Reagan's re
quest March 19. However, of the four House
committees reviewing the package, only the
Armed Services Committee is expected to vote
for it.
Panel urges drug tests
WASHINGTON — The President's Commis
sion on Organized Crime urged yesterday that all
federal employees and government contractors
be required to take tests for drug use or risk
being fired.
In a 455-page report to President Reagan on
drug use in America, compiled over two-and
one-half years, the commission also suggested
that the military take on an increased drug
enforcement role, and that the National Security
Agency set up an information system to be
shared by all drug-fighting agencies.
The commission also suggested that state and
local agencies and private employers consider
drug testing.
Warning that individuals who take drugs
should not be "packing parachutes or building
airplanes," Rodney Smith, the commission's dep
uty executive director, said, "If you want to work
in a sensitive job and get money from the govern
ment, you ought to be drug-free. .. . The notion
that it is okay to use a little drugs on a sport basis
is at the heart of our problem."
Allan Adler, legislative counsel of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union, called the drug-testing
recommendation "very irresponsible" and an
"unwarranted invasion of the privacy of millions
of workers."
"It raises very serious Fourth Amendment is
sues (concerning) the right to be protected
against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Court to decide veto use
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
moving to resolve a constitutional impasse be
tween the Reagan Administration and members
of Congress, said yesterday that it would decide
when the president can exercise a "pocket veto"
to kill legislation he opposes.
The justices will hear a Department of Justice
appeal of a lower-court ruling that found that
President Reagan illegally used the historic
device to invalidate a bill Congress passed in
1983 conditioning aid to El Salvador on progress
in human rights.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled
that the president could use the pocket veto only
when Congress adjourns every two years for
elections and not during other recesses. Begin
ning with President Jefferson, 27 presidents have
exercised the pocket veto more than 200 times
during vacations or recesses between sessions of
the same Congress, according to the Department
of Justice.
Dow drops below 1,700
NEW YORK — The stock market retreated
yesterday, yielding to sellers who pushed the
Dow Jones industrial average back below the
1,700 level it surmounted for the first time last
week.
The drop, which came despite another day of
extraordinary strength in the bond market, was
attributed to profit-taking rather than any signifi
cant change in the news background.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 12.39 to 1,696.67.
