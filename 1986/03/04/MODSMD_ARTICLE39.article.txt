Spy evidence discussed
SAN FRANCISCO — Prosecutors in the spy
trial of former Navy code expert Jerry Whitworth
sought yesterday to bring in evidence of what the
judge has described as a virtual confession — a
series of anonymous letters to the FBI declaring
involvement in a spy ring.
Only someone with Whitworth's "unique
knowledge" of an espionage conspiracy could
have written the so-called RUS letters, Asst. U.S.
Attorney William Farmer told U.S. District
Judge John Vukasin.
But defense lawyer James Larson argued that
the details of the spy operation and Whitworth's
alleged knowledge of it would be established only
if the jury believed the prosecution's star witness,
confessed spymaster John Walker.
Vukasin deferred a ruling on the issue until
today at the earliest, when jury selection is sched
uled to begin.
Whitworth. 46, of Davis, Calif., is accused of
passing secrets on Navy code and radio commu
nications systems to Walker, his longtime friend,
from 1 to 1983 for $332,000. The 13 charges
against him include seven espionage and conspir
acy counts that carry potential life sentences,
along with tcix evasion charges involving the
$332,000.

He is the last of four defendants in the Walker
case to face trial. John Walker and his son, Mi
chael, have pleaded guilty to espionage charges
in a Baltimore federal court, and John's brother
Arthur has been convicted by a federal judge in
Norfolk, Va.
Fiedler enters race
COMMERCE — Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, saying
criminal charges overturned by a judge have
given her statewide recognition worth $ 1 million,
officially filed yesterday for the Republican nom
ination for U.S. Senate.
Fiedler was accompanied at the county
Registrar of Voters office by aide-fiance Paul
Clarke, who also had faced a political payoff
charge before a judge dismissed the grand jury
indictment last week.
The congresswoman, saying she believes her
legal problems are behind her, promised to focus
on wresting the Senate seat from Alan Cranston,
the Democrat seeking a fourth term.
"The only hurdle now is a normal one for a
campaign, raising the funds and reaching the
electorate,'" the San Fernando Valley Republican
said. Clarke didn't talk to reporters.
The county grand jury indicted Fiedler, 48,

and Clarke, 39, in January on charges they vio
lated state election law by offering $100,000 to
state Sen. Ed Davis' campaign to get Davis to
drop out of the Republican primary race.
The district attorney's office last week asked
the court to dismiss the indictment against Fied
ler on grounds of insufficient evidence, but said it
wished to prosecute Clarke.
However, Superior Court Judge Robert
Altman dismissed the indictments against both.
He said there was inadequate evidence to prose
cute Fiedler and that prosecutors improperly ex
plained the law under which Clarke was charged
to the grand jury.
Also seeking the Republican U.S. Senate nom
ination are Davis, Los Angeles County super
visor Mike Antonovich, college professor Bill Al
len, former Black Panther leader Eldridge
Cleaver, economist Arthur Laffer, Assemblyman
Bob Nay lor, Rep. Ed Zschau, former publisher
Joseph Knowland and television commentator
Bruce Herschensohn.
Today's weather
Expect a great deal of snow. You won't get it,
but you can expect it. You will get mostly sunny
skies with highs in the mid-70s and lows around
60.
