# Pentagon funding: a costly dilemma
## 
### KEVIN COAKLEY 
Kay Kostuk, a graduate student in
electrical engineering, said he
"doesn't feel good" about receiving
Strategic Defense Initiative Organi
zation funding. But because civilian

agencies do not fund all basic re
search. many graduate students, like
Kostuk, reluctantly accept Pentagon
money even though they think that
basic research is too important to be
left to the generals.
Because "the arms race is out of
hand" and"the military can have ;in

insidious effect on funding
priorities." Kostuk said he objects to
military support of basic research.
Unfortunately for Kostuk, funds
from a civilian agency like the the Na
tional Science Foundation (NSF)
were not available for his laser optics
research. Kostuk added. "NSF prob
ably looks at what DoD ( Department
of Defense) funds before deciding
what it funds."
Given current political trends,
many more graduate students will
face Kostuk's dilemma. According to
a report from Stanford's Sponsored
Projects Office, the DoD share of
Stanford's federal support increased from
9.5 percent to 13.1 percent over the last five
years. Last year, Stanford accepted $24 mil
lion from the Pentagon compared to $18
million from NASA, $24 million from NSF
and $20 million from the Department of
Energy (excluding the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center).
Because Kostuk said his work has
"fundamental scientific worth," and "its
humanitarian applications outweigh its mili
tary applications," he reluctantly accepts
DoD support.
However, Kostuk said, "One can't be
naive. Accepting military funding for basic
research is a moral dilemma I'll probably
face throughout my career."
Although Kostuk accepts military funding
for basic research, he said he would never
work on direct weapons research.
Applied physics graduate student Jackie
Spong, like Kostuk, accepts SDI support to
pursue laser research. Spong said she hopes
to develop an ultraviolet laser which would
have broad civilian applications.
"Biologists could make holograms of
DNA molecules with a UV laser," Spong
said.
Spong also prefers NSF funding over
DoD funding but she "doesn't lose sleep
over the issue.
"No civilian agency was willing to fund
our basic research except SDI," she said.
Furthermore, Spong said, "Never have
our DoD sponsors exerted the slightest
pressure on how our research should
proceed. We take our good ideas to DoD
and they give us money to do what we other
wise would do with an NSF grant"
Like Kostuk, Mark Matthews, a graduate
student in statistics and a member of the Nu
clear Weapons Freeze Campaign, finds

Pentagon funding of basic research trou
bling. But since his work in computer graph
ics and data analysis has general civilian ap
plications, he ambivalently accepts partial
support from the Office of Naval Research.
Matthews said, "I research only what I'm
interested in. ... I would never do any work
which 1 felt was contributing to the
likelihood of war or to this country's ability
to wage offensive war."
But, as always, there are others who
believe just the opposite. Unlike Kostuk,
Spong and Matthews, Computer Science
Professor John McCarthy strongly endorsed
DoD funding of basic research.
McCarthy said, "Of course DoD funding
is good. We have to defend our country,
don't we?"
Others, like computer science graduate
student Andy Freeman, dismiss ethical con
cerns about military funding of basic re
search. Because all science and technology
ultimately has a military application,
Freeman said it doesn't matter who funds
the work.
"Even today's research in cosmology will
definitely have a military application in the
future," Freeman said.
Terry Winograd, associate professor of
computer science and co-founder of Com
puter Professionals for Social Responsibil
ity, said that Freeman's attitude "was a
cop-out, but a cop-out with some truth."
"The issue isn't black and white,"
Winograd said.
"Both food research and bomb research
have military applications, but obviously
have different civilian applications," he
added.
Winograd fears that given the spiraling
arms race, shifting priorities towards the
military end of the spectrum actually
endangers the national security. Moreover,
Winograd worries about the increasing role

the military has in shaping attitudes and
opinions throughout society.
"A researcher in Artificial Intelligence
must now demonstrate more immediate and
direct military applications to get a DoD
contract," Winograd said.
According to Winograd, because re
searchers propose work that will please
sponsors (DoDcirculates requests for fund
ing proposals), many researchers have an
"illusion of freedom."
Winograd said, "DoD does not need to
tell you what to do. They need only an
nounce that some large amount of funds is
available for work in area X, and to stop
funds in area Y."
Winograd added that researchers at pres
tigious universities, like Stanford, receive
more DoD funds for abstract and funda
mental work than less prestigious univer
sities, like lowa State, which must "scramble
for more applied and blatantly military con
tracts, like guided missiles, to survive."
But Winograd understands that the di
lemma has no simple resolution.
"Given the national situation, it would be
economic suicide for our researchers and
educational programs to refuse Pentagon
contracts," Winograd said.
Winograd added that Stanford's Com
puter Science Department depends on DoD
for about half of its total budget.
Not so surprisingly, most of the graduate
students interviewed accept military support
but do not want to contribute to an alarming
arms race. Even strong critics of America's
military buildup often depend on Pentagon
contracts. Instead of wondering why so
many researchers accept DoD support, per
haps one should ask why DoD, and not
NSF, has so much to dole out. Perhaps basic
research is too important to be left to the
generals.

student in statistics and a member of the Nu
clear Weapons Freeze Campaign, finds

Pentagon funding of basic research trou
bling. But since his work in computer graph
ics and data analysis has general civilian ap
plications, he ambivalently accepts partial
support from the Office of Naval Research.
Matthews said, "I research only what I'm
interested in. ... I would never do any work
which 1 felt was contributing to the
likelihood of war or to this country's ability
to wage offensive war."
But, as always, there are others who
believe just the opposite. Unlike Kostuk,
Spong and Matthews, Computer Science
Professor John McCarthy strongly endorsed
DoD funding of basic research.
McCarthy said, "Of course DoD funding
is good. We have to defend our country,
don't we?"
Others, like computer science graduate
student Andy Freeman, dismiss ethical con
cerns about military funding of basic re
search. Because all science and technology
ultimately has a military application,
Freeman said it doesn't matter who funds
the work.
"Even today's research in cosmology will
definitely have a military application in the
future," Freeman said.
Terry Winograd, associate professor of
computer science and co-founder of Com
puter Professionals for Social Responsibil
ity, said that Freeman's attitude "was a
cop-out, but a cop-out with some truth."
"The issue isn't black and white,"
Winograd said.
"Both food research and bomb research
have military applications, but obviously
have different civilian applications," he
added.
Winograd fears that given the spiraling
arms race, shifting priorities towards the
military end of the spectrum actually
endangers the national security. Moreover,
Winograd worries about the increasing role

the military has in shaping attitudes and
opinions throughout society.
"A researcher in Artificial Intelligence
must now demonstrate more immediate and
direct military applications to get a DoD
contract," Winograd said.
According to Winograd, because re
searchers propose work that will please
sponsors (DoDcirculates requests for fund
ing proposals), many researchers have an
"illusion of freedom."
Winograd said, "DoD does not need to
tell you what to do. They need only an
nounce that some large amount of funds is
available for work in area X, and to stop
funds in area Y."
Winograd added that researchers at pres
tigious universities, like Stanford, receive
more DoD funds for abstract and funda
mental work than less prestigious univer
sities, like lowa State, which must "scramble
for more applied and blatantly military con
tracts, like guided missiles, to survive."
But Winograd understands that the di
lemma has no simple resolution.
"Given the national situation, it would be
economic suicide for our researchers and
educational programs to refuse Pentagon
contracts," Winograd said.
Winograd added that Stanford's Com
puter Science Department depends on DoD
for about half of its total budget.
Not so surprisingly, most of the graduate
students interviewed accept military support
but do not want to contribute to an alarming
arms race. Even strong critics of America's
military buildup often depend on Pentagon
contracts. Instead of wondering why so
many researchers accept DoD support, per
haps one should ask why DoD, and not
NSF, has so much to dole out. Perhaps basic
research is too important to be left to the
generals.
Kay Kostuk, a graduate student in
electrical engineering, said he
"doesn't feel good" about receiving
Strategic Defense Initiative Organi
zation funding. But because civilian

agencies do not fund all basic re
search. many graduate students, like
Kostuk, reluctantly accept Pentagon
money even though they think that
basic research is too important to be
left to the generals.
Because "the arms race is out of
hand" and"the military can have ;in

insidious effect on funding
priorities." Kostuk said he objects to
military support of basic research.
Unfortunately for Kostuk, funds
from a civilian agency like the the Na
tional Science Foundation (NSF)
were not available for his laser optics
research. Kostuk added. "NSF prob
ably looks at what DoD ( Department
of Defense) funds before deciding
what it funds."
Given current political trends,
many more graduate students will
face Kostuk's dilemma. According to
a report from Stanford's Sponsored
Projects Office, the DoD share of
Stanford's federal support increased from
9.5 percent to 13.1 percent over the last five
years. Last year, Stanford accepted $24 mil
lion from the Pentagon compared to $18
million from NASA, $24 million from NSF
and $20 million from the Department of
Energy (excluding the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center).
Because Kostuk said his work has
"fundamental scientific worth," and "its
humanitarian applications outweigh its mili
tary applications," he reluctantly accepts
DoD support.
However, Kostuk said, "One can't be
naive. Accepting military funding for basic
research is a moral dilemma I'll probably
face throughout my career."
Although Kostuk accepts military funding
for basic research, he said he would never
work on direct weapons research.
Applied physics graduate student Jackie
Spong, like Kostuk, accepts SDI support to
pursue laser research. Spong said she hopes
to develop an ultraviolet laser which would
have broad civilian applications.
"Biologists could make holograms of
DNA molecules with a UV laser," Spong
said.
Spong also prefers NSF funding over
DoD funding but she "doesn't lose sleep
over the issue.
"No civilian agency was willing to fund
our basic research except SDI," she said.
Furthermore, Spong said, "Never have
our DoD sponsors exerted the slightest
pressure on how our research should
proceed. We take our good ideas to DoD
and they give us money to do what we other
wise would do with an NSF grant"
