# Staff attacks AIC reforms
## Student input may be cut 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Administrative staff members of
the Innovative Academic Courses of
fice (I AC) yesterday expressed sharp
criticism of restructuring changes
within the lAC that they fear will
result in an eventual "watering
down - ' of student involvement in
undergraduate-organized courses at
Stanford.
The staff of the I AC, which spon
sors the Stanford Workshops on Poli
tical and Social Issues (SWOPSI),
currently includes several non-faculty
administrators and one student co
director. The proposed restructuring,
engineered by Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
Lougee in conjunction with 1 AC Fac
ulty Director Jack Winkler,
reportedly calls for the hiring of
"scholar-activist" individuals with
doctorate level education.
"Students will have no more input
into classes. How long before they say
students can't teach them?" lAC Pro
gram Coordinator Barbara Jurin-
Reid asked yesterday.
Jurin-Reid criticized the Arrow
Report, on which Lougee reportedly
has based the need for restructuring,
as misrepresenting SWOPSI's aca
demic strength. The report, released

by a commission led by Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow in 1984, raised
doubts as to whether SWOPSI
courses were as "rigorous and de
manding academically" as other
Stanford courses.
"The figures in the Arrow report
don't back up the claims," Jurin-Reid
said. "(SWOPSI courses are) the
most heavily reviewed classes on
campus."
Both Jurin-Reid and lAC Student
Coordinator Betsy Jelliffe claimed
that Lougee's proposed changes
stemmed from professional conflicts
between Winkler — the sole faculty
administrator — and other staff
members. Jelliffe said that Winkler
had decided upon the relevance or
legitimacy of proposed SWOPSI
courses without consulting other ad
ministrators.
Winkler's current collaboration
with Lougee is an attempt to
legitimize his previous actions, Jellife
said.
"The program is being completely
rehashed," Jellife said. "The program
initiated by students in the '60s will
be undermined."
Jellife added that "a lot"' of current
and past SWOPSI instructors had
contacted her offering their support
apd sharing her criticisms of the pro
posed restructuring.
> Jurin-Reid paraphrased Winkler's

job description as one in which the
administrator must "work with and
with the support of (other administra
tive staff) in all steps in the process of
course development ... as part of a
faculty/student governance
structure."
Winkler, however, said last night

that changes within SWOPSI will
facilitate efforts to discover student
academic interests, adding that the
role of the student coordinator will
remain the same.
"We want to sharpen the 'sting' of
SWOPSI's courses," Winkler said.

He cited a current class on animal re
search and a course scheduled for
next quarter on black athletes as two
examples of subjects that represent
strong student interests.
"I want SWOPSI to be a place
where the hottest questions about in
stitutions and their power get raised,"

Winkler said.
"It became clear to me that struc
tural changes (within SWOPSI) were
necessary," Winkler said in response
to criticisms of his program adminis
tration. "The staff at SWOPSI —who
I'm not criticizing — aren't as strong
on the 'scholar/activist' side as the

restructural staff will be."
But Jurin-Reid refuted the idea
that a need for academic strengthen
ing within SWOPSI warranted the
proposed changes.
"(SWOPSI) doesn't need academic
strengthening," Jurin-Reid said. "It
needs academic legitimacy."
