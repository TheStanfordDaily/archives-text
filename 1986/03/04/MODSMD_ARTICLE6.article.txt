# Taxes may apply to student financial aid

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the fifth in u series of articles
focusing on the effects of recent
federal tax legislation on the Univer
sity.
Stanford administrators say they
are concerned by the possible effects
of what University President Donald
Kennedy has called "outrageous"
changes in the tax code that would tax
student aid in excess of tuition.
The expiration of Section 127 of
the Internal Revenue Code on Jan. 1
effectively ended the tax-exempt
status granted to tuition benefits
given to teaching assistant (TA) and
research assistant (RA) positions for
graduate students.
Although this exemption would be
restored by Senate passage of the
House-approved Tax Reform Act of
1985. the act would alter existing lan
guage in another section to tax all tui
tion benefits, both undergraduate and
graduate, that are not specifically ear
marked for tuition or equipment.
Ihe tax reform package is now
being considered by the Senate
Finance Committee, which will
produce its own version of the bill
before an anticipated floor vote in
August.

Under current law, all scholarship
awards are excluded from taxation as
personal income, and tuition benefits
given to RAs and TAs for teaching
and research projects are also,ex
empt, regardless of whether the
teaching or research is necessary to
satisfy degree requirements.
Stanford is required by the Internal
Revenue Service to report all tuition
benefits as income and to withhold
the appropriate taxes from salary
paychecks, as the tax code requires
taxes to be paid as income is earned.
To find out if they will be affected
by the new tax, students should fol
low the standard April 15 income tax
pattern of computing actual liability
and comparing it to total withholding.
Taxpayers are entitled to refunds if
withholding exceeds computed
liability, but owe the difference if
liability exceeds withholding. If the
withholding is insufficient, a penalty
of I I percent per annum on the
shortfall may be levied against the
taxpayer
Programmers are working
feverishly to upgrade the University
payroll system in an attempt to meet
a self-imposed target date of April 22
for the new withholding system, said
Chris Canellos of the University Con-
troller's Office. Although no special withhold
ing provisions were made for winter quarter,
students are still responsible for paying any ad
ditional tax accrued between Jan. 1 and the im
plementation of the new withholding rates.
According to figures provided by Dean of
Graduate Studies Elizabeth Traugott and the
Controller's Office, the typical stipend check of
$367 per pay period for six payroll periods
would now have withholdings of $102 federal
tax and $28 state tax per period.
For a typical single student without additional
dependents, this would mean a $84 paycheck
reduction per period. The reduction would be
smaller for married students or those with more
dependents.
The tax law also stipulates that an individual's
total withholding must be at least 80 percent of
current or 100 percent of last year's income tax
liability.
Students with unstable long-term incomes
who might have unnecessarily large withholding
may declare exemption provided that the 80
percent rules and other requirements are met,
Canellos said. Those who claim exemption must
show no 1985 tax liability in addition to an
ticipating no liability in 1986.
Students who estimate that their withholdings
may be insufficient may also request additional
automatic withholding from the University
Payroll office.
The proposal to tax all scholarship aid in
excess of tuition would also discriminate against
the neediest undergraduate students, said
Robert Huff, University director of Financial
Aid.
Because financial aid is determined by sub
tracting student resources from total educa
tional cost, students with limited resources

invariably receive aid in excess of tuition, Huff
said.
When combined with normal summer earn
ings, scholarship assistance for Stanford room
and board could very easily exceed the current
personal income tax deductible of $3,374.
According to statistics provided by the Finan
cial Aids Office, 414 undergraduates, including
186 students on "full-ride" athletic scholar
ships, currently receive scholarship assistance
exceeding tuition. The average award in excess
of tuition is $2,351 per student.
Stanford tuition for the 1985-86 academic
year is $10,476. Room and board is an addi
tional $4,417. On Feb. 11, the Board of Trus
tees approved a 1986-87 basic tuition rate of
$11,208, a 7 percent increase. Room-and
board charges will also rise 6.4 percent to
$4,700.
The scholarship aid in excess of tuition, which
includes University, Cal and Pell grants,
amounts to about $973,000 this year. The
$973,000 does not include private, outside
scholarship awards that may go unreported,
Huff said.
The non-extension of the tax exemption did
not indicate opposition to the measure on its
merits, but rather efforts to gain political
"leverage" on other issues, said Jacyn Mitchell,
University director of government relations.
"There was no attempt to target Section
127," Mitchell told an audience of about 100
concerned graduate students at a Jan. 29
meeting. "The whole package of expiring provi
sions got caught up in the larger, political
manuevering of those final days."
The University will actively lobby to re
establish the tax exemptions through various
educational associations, such as the American
Council on Education and the National Associ
ation of Student Financial Aid Administrators.
"I have already begun and will continue to
raise my voice against this legislation," Huff
said.
