This is the fifth in u series of articles
focusing on the effects of recent
federal tax legislation on the Univer
sity.
Stanford administrators say they
are concerned by the possible effects
of what University President Donald
Kennedy has called "outrageous"
changes in the tax code that would tax
student aid in excess of tuition.
The expiration of Section 127 of
the Internal Revenue Code on Jan. 1
effectively ended the tax-exempt
status granted to tuition benefits
given to teaching assistant (TA) and
research assistant (RA) positions for
graduate students.
Although this exemption would be
restored by Senate passage of the
House-approved Tax Reform Act of
1985. the act would alter existing lan
guage in another section to tax all tui
tion benefits, both undergraduate and
graduate, that are not specifically ear
marked for tuition or equipment.
Ihe tax reform package is now
being considered by the Senate
Finance Committee, which will
produce its own version of the bill
before an anticipated floor vote in
August.

Under current law, all scholarship
awards are excluded from taxation as
personal income, and tuition benefits
given to RAs and TAs for teaching
and research projects are also,ex
empt, regardless of whether the
teaching or research is necessary to
satisfy degree requirements.
Stanford is required by the Internal
Revenue Service to report all tuition
benefits as income and to withhold
the appropriate taxes from salary
paychecks, as the tax code requires
taxes to be paid as income is earned.
To find out if they will be affected
by the new tax, students should fol
low the standard April 15 income tax
pattern of computing actual liability
and comparing it to total withholding.
Taxpayers are entitled to refunds if
withholding exceeds computed
liability, but owe the difference if
liability exceeds withholding. If the
withholding is insufficient, a penalty
of I I percent per annum on the
shortfall may be levied against the
taxpayer
Programmers are working
feverishly to upgrade the University
payroll system in an attempt to meet
a self-imposed target date of April 22
for the new withholding system, said
