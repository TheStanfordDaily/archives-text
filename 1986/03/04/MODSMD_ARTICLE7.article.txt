# Creationists clash with evolutionists
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Staff writer 
"If you are inclined to believe in creationism, it is not unscientific, it
is not irrational, it is not anti-intellectual," a noted creationist told a
standing-room-only crowd at Branner Hall last night.
Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research debated
evolutionist Prof. Bernard Sarich of UC-Berkeley on "the origins of
the earth and the species thereon." according to moderator, Kennell
Jackson, a history professor and Branner resident fellow.
Gish said in his opening statement that "every major plant or
animal has appeared in its present form from the start... in 100 mil
lion years of 'evolution' there isn't even a trace of an inter
mediary. . . . The missing links are still missing."

Prof. Bernard Sarieh debated evolution last night in Branner.
"We can trace over the last four
million years in detail the changes
that changed something near a chimp
into us," responded Sarich in his
opening statement. He named the sea
otter, river otter and mink as inter
mediaries in evolutionary develop
ment. "Don't go telling me there
aren't any intermediate forms," he
said. "You've just got to look.
Sarich said that "organisms are not
equally different from each other
(genetically). . . our genes are 1.8
percent different from a chimpanzee
and 30 percent different from a dog.
"I'd like to ask creationists, 'Why
were our genes created in the image

of a chimpanzee?' "
On the question of the origin of the
universe, Gish said, "I reject the un
scientific notion that hydrogen gas
changed into what we have today."
The universe is becoming less and
less orderly, he said. "We can con
clude from the laws of ther
modynamics that the universe could
not have created itself. Its origins
could not have been intrinsic . . .
therefore its origins had to be extrin
sic."
Sarich asked in response, "If you're
concerned with order and you need
an introducer (of order into the uni
verse), who is going to order the in
troducer? The question is, who
created God?
"If you want a God I have no ob
jections," Sarich said. "He just has to

follow the rules."
The probability of the correct
molecules colliding for life to have
evolved is "one over one followed by
40,000 zeros," Gish said, attributing
the calculation to British astronomer
Sir Frederick Hoyle. The chances of
life evolving are the same as the
chances of a tornado "sweeping
through a junkyard and assembling a
747 (jetliner)," he claimed.
Sarich charged that "creation sci
ence begins and ends with the idea
that evolutionary science can't be
right. . . there is no creation science."
Gish responded that "Fred Hoyle
concluded that if evolution of life is
physically impossible, there is only
one other choice, supernatural crea
tion . . . there are only those two pos
sibilities.
