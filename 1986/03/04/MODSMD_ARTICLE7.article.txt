# Creationists clash with evolutionists

"If you are inclined to believe in creationism, it is not unscientific, it
is not irrational, it is not anti-intellectual," a noted creationist told a
standing-room-only crowd at Branner Hall last night.
Duane Gish of the Institute for Creation Research debated
evolutionist Prof. Bernard Sarich of UC-Berkeley on "the origins of
the earth and the species thereon." according to moderator, Kennell
Jackson, a history professor and Branner resident fellow.
Gish said in his opening statement that "every major plant or
animal has appeared in its present form from the start... in 100 mil
lion years of 'evolution' there isn't even a trace of an inter
mediary. . . . The missing links are still missing."
