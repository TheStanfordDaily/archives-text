The union representing staff nurses
at Stanford Hospital last night over
whelmingly ratified a new two-year
contract that increases wages but
reduces on-call pay, according to
Myra Lang, the unions president and
chief negotiator.
The union — the Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achievement
(CRONA) — and the hospital be
gan contract negotiations Jan. 2.
CRONA represents 1,157 staff
nurses at the hospital.
The new contract, which was ap
proved by a 716 to 114 vote, includes
a 4 percent annual wage increase, a
cut in educational program funding, a
reduction in pay for on-call nurses
and "layoff language ... we feel is
workable," Lang said.
"The contract is a concession con
tract, no doubt about it," she said.
According to University Staff
Counsel Priscilla Wheeler, chief
negotiator for the hospital, "It's a
good agreement . . . both sides
worked very hard and very respon
sibly to reach it."
Currently, on-call nurses are paid
half-time for the hours they spend at
home waiting to be called in, and the
new contract calls for quarter-time,
Lang said.
In addition, the contract specifies
"objective ways of measuring
(nurses') skills" so that layoffs will be
determined considering skill level
first, seniority second, she said.
The layoff language was not de
signed in response to the recently
proposed hospital layoffs, Lang said,
adding that it would be unlikely that
such layoffs would affect staff nurses.
"Nurses effectively have been
laid off since 1983," she said. The
layoffs have been "day-by-day layoffs
. . . they tell you to go home if they
don't need you," she said.
"It's a horrible time to be negotiat
ing a contract," Lang said. The con
tract was "based on the hospital's
need to cut costs."
Although cost-containment was a
major concern, the hospital sought to
make such cuts only "while maintain
ing quality care . . . and [nurses] are
one of the most important parts of
that (quality care)," Wheeler said.
