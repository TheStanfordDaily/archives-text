# High costs defeat Donner party
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
The Donner Street Party is no
more.
In a simple majority vote, Donner
residents attending a house meeting
last week decided against staging the
annual party, opting instead for a
number of smaller dorm-based func
tions.
"It was a very close vote," said
Curtis Cook, a Donner resident assis
tant.
Michael Jackson, Donner resident

fellow and assistant to Provost James
Rosse, suggested that three factors
may have conspired against the street
party, a long-time favorite among
large-scale campus social events: high
costs, the long hours needed for plan
ning and executing the fete with suc
cess, and the risk of something going
wrong.
"Some of the students thought that
they could use dorm funds and their
energies in a different way," Jackson
said. "They didn't want to be bound
by the past."
Meeting the proposed $3,8v)() party

budget would have meant fund
raising. depleting house dues and the
elimination of other spring quarter
activities, according to Cook.
"(Dorm residents) realized that
they probably wouldn't have the
time," Cook said. "When residents
were asked to volunteer time to the
party effort, there were not enough
volunteers to manage the affair."
The residents were also concerned
that "if anything goes wrong, it goes
back to the RF, and some people
didn't want him to have that burden.

although he was willing if we wanted
to do it," Cook said.
Cook said security for the party
was not a concern because it could
have been managed by Donner resi
dents. He added that Stanford police
had already approved an arrange
ment to let the party run until mid
night.
He noted that such precautions had
not been made in staging last spring's
Rinc-A-Delt party, an annual
campus-wide affair that was shut
down by police due to alleged com
plaints from Palo Alto residents.
