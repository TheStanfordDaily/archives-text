## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Preserve IAC programs 
### 
» Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of humanities and
sciences, has assured us that proposed changes in the
Innovative Academic Courses (lAC) office will not
threaten the essential nature of the courses offered by
the office. That is good, because the I AC is a good
thing.
Offering extra-departmental courses through the
Stanford Workshop on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI), Freshman-Sophomore Seminars and Un
dergraduate Special Courses (UGS), the I AC offers a
refreshing alternative to standard Stanford classes. But
according to Lougee, who is instrumental in proposing
the changes, the I AC programs have "become on the
periphery of student interest and the periphery of in
stitutional concern, and they are not as strong as they
should be academically or in the servicing of student
needs."
Lougee has proposed that the I AC be brought closer
to the University to solve such concerns. But will such
a change actually strengthen the programs?
No. The original impetus behind establishing extra
departmental programs offered by the I AC was a need
to offer "off the beaten track" classes — interesting
classes on contemporary social and political issues. Ef
forts to bring classes such as "Critique of Progressive
Politics" and "Animal Rights and Animal Research"
into the mainstream of University coursework would
effectively pasteurize the essential character of the
courses.
As far as the academic rigor of such courses, it is the
students' choice as to whether he or she wants to take a
course that is geared more toward discussion than
graded work, and since SWOPSI is an extra
departmental program, it is not possible for a student

to major in it and miss out on strenuous academics.
In addition, the fact that the SWOPSI staff
reportedly must now have a doctorate degree
precludes the current staff from working in the pro
gram, since they do not have such degrees. And it is
questionable that the "scholar-activists" that will
replace the current staffers, as proposed by SWOPSI
faculty adviser Jack Winkler, would be able to replace
the years of community participation exemplified by
the current staff. If the change were taken one step fur
ther, requiring that the instructors of the classes have
doctorate degress, it would indeed be a loss to
SWOPSI classes, currently taught by community mem
bers and students.
The extra-departmental programs have been in flux
since the summer of 1984, when a commission headed
by Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow released a report
that led to the restructuring of extra-departmental pro
grams in the fall, dismantling of the Student Center for
Innovative Reserach and Education and the Action
Research Liaison Office, and placing SWOPSI, UGS
and freshman-sophomore seminars under one roof of
the I AC. Yet since then, there apparently has been no
official report of any re-evaluation of the programs.
Why are they being changed now, after having been al
tered just last fall?
Restructuring of such a long-standing program
should only take place after adequate and thorough re
search has been done. If that research has been done,
then it should be made public. If an extensive restruc
turing is indeed going to occur, students should be
allowed to know the motivation behind such a move,
and they also should be assured that the changes will
not alter what is already a good thing.
