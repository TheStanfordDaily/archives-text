# Make difference, not just noise
## 
### 
After our weekend visit by Tom Brokaw and crew, the
campus phrase that pays has become, "You can make a
difference." Anyone caught saying "question authority"
is obviously out of touch with the chic mainstream campus
elite. Many student efforts including Reach Out Today,
The Stanford Volunteer Network and Bike Aid clearly
and postively demonstrate that students can make a dif
ference. Other student endeavors this year have been less
successful and should consider whether they are really
making a difference or just making noise.

Last fall, a number of protestors refused to leave Old
Union in response to Stanford's investments in South
Africa. After senior Robby Perkins was severely and un
reasonably beaten by the police, the protests continued.
Some were still protesting for divestment, some were pro
testing police brutality and some were protesting our
losing football team. I protested — from a distance — that
my midterms were too hard. What resulted from the inci
dent? What good was accomplished?
Law Prof. John Kaplan was requested by University
President Donald Kennedy to investigate the charges of
police brutality. In less than two weeks, Kaplan inter
viewed everyone concerned and produced a report that
was clear, fair and thorough. Kaplan admits that his report
is incomplete and inconclusive regarding events at the
North County Jail where the beating took place. He was
denied the results of a departmental internal investigation
and the opportunity to interview key personnel.
The ASSU, The Daily editorial board and the Black
Student Union (BSU) berated the report as biased, unfair
and false. They wanted disciplinary action against the
Stanford police and advocated hiring an outside inves
tigator who would provide that conclusion. The Stanford
police admitted that their compliance-pain methods were
inappropriate and procured slings by the next protest. The
Stanford police reacted quickly and did not wait for an
outside agency to mandate the change.
Besides, the compliance-pain techniques were legal,
which is more than can be said for the actions of the stu
dents who chose to occupy the building. The latest pro
posal is the Stanford Police Review Committee to moni
tor the actions of the Stanford police.
Why isn't anybody concerned with the Santa Clara
County police and the beating that occurred at the North
County Jail? It is a shame that the students and the ad
ministration could not join forces to determine why a
Stanford student left the North County jail bruised and
beaten. Instead, the students and the administration seem
to be on opposite sides with the focus being the actions of
the Stanford police.
Perkins has submitted a claim against Stanford for
$600,100 which has been denied. A law suit may be

forthcoming. What has Perkins stated he will do with the
money? Will he donate it to an anti-apartheid cause, the
focus of his original protest? Will he contribute to the fur
thering of black rights? Perkins has stated that he will give
$100,000 each to the officers who beat him up if they will
resign from the force. He is offering to pay their pensions.
Personally, I would fear that for $100,000 numerous
other people would want to beat me up. What has been
accomplished by all of this? Has Stanford divested? Is
there any less chance that future arrestees will be beaten
by authorities? Have we made a difference or have we just
made noise?
Last week, the ASSU Senate resolved to declare Stan
ford a sanctuary for Central American refugees denied
immigration by the U.S. government. The students sup
porting the effort suggested we house and feed the
refugees, teach them English and introduce them to
American culture. Numerous obvious difficulties have yet
to be addressed by the students proposing this dubious
and illegal venture. Since dorm space is insufficient to
house all of the Stanford students, where would the
refugees stay? How would they be fed? What would hap
pen to the Stanford crime rate? Please Uncle Don, can we
keep them! We'll take care of them, we promise. If we
don't take them in, they will be put to sleep. Sound
familiar? The students involved have made a sincere
humane gesture. I believe they are genuinely concerned
about the welfare of their fellow human being. But unless
a realistic, well reasoned plan accompanies such a pro
posal, we are not making a difference, we are just making
noise.
To increase student awareness of oppression in South
Africa and demonstrate our solidarity with the black
South African people, several students erected cardboard
shanties in the middle of White Plaza. The effort
produced an eyesore on an otherwise beautiful campus.
The only publicity generated from the shantytown came
when several students destroyed the structure.
It sets a dangerous precedent for the University to allow
a select group of students to trash our campus in order to
make other students aware of a particular problem. There
are many other serious world issues that could
legitimately demand equal time. Since pollution is an ever
increasing problem, why not fill our fountains with toxic
waste to increase student understanding?
Perhaps we could break windows in Old Union to sim
ulate conditions in Lebanon and Northern Ireland. Why
not string barbed wire to separate the engineering half of
campus from the "fuzzy study" side to model Iron Curtain
conditions? The possibilities are endless. With a little ef
fort, we could have the ugliest campus in the country, but
we certainly would be socially aware. Why doesn't Stan
ford Out of South Africa (SOSA) raise money for a
sculpture or monument that would be original with Stan
ford, would complement the aesthetic nature of the
campus and be a permanent reminder of our concern and
support to a worthwhile cause?
It is wonderful when student planning, dedication, in
novation and cooperation help to improve the lives of
others. Students can make a difference. We must also
realize that there is a fine line between making a differ
ence and just making noise.
