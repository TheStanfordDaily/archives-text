Act on principles:
divest funds now
The University's recent abstention
from voting on a Hewlett-Packard
shareholder resolution (Daily. Keb.
2t>) demonstrates the nony of Stan
ford's present investment policy. The
shareholder resolution would ha\e
birred Hewlett-Packard from selling
equipment to the South African gov
ernment.
Last spring we heard from the
Board of Trustees that, in fact, only
by retaining its investments.can Stan
ford make a difference. Voting on
shareholder resolutions are the vehi
cle to push for change in South
Africa. v\e were told. After all. the ar
gument went, if Stanford and other
"socially icsponsihle investors were

to sell their stock, the remaining in
vestors would not support such
resolutions.
The abstention is symbolic of the
administration's stance. The unwill
ingness of the administration to act
on its principles stands as a challenge
for the community to respond. Ulti
mately. the most vital ingredient of
any socially responsible investment
policy is the political will to imple
ment it.

Cut tenure secrecy
I am writing in connection with the
recent discussion on the failure of the
History Department to give an ap

pointment to visiting Prof. Norman
Davies.
I fully endorse Oleg Jardetzky s in
junction that professors who vote on
an appointment be required to
thoroughly research the scholarship
of the appointee (" Davies" rejection
raises questions," Daily, Feb. 20). It
does not appear that the rest of the
History Department did so as
thoroughly as did the search commit
tee which had recommended Davies'
appointment. The answer given by
the department (Daily, Feb. 27)
seems to me to skirt the issue.
In this particular case, the as
surance given by Prof. Peter Paret
that "There is absolutely no question
in my mind that procedures were fol
lowed precisely" may be correct.
However, as I shall disclose in detail
.it an appropriate time, my own expe

riences show that given human
frailties and the extraordinary con
fidential nature of the evaluation
process at Stanford, something more
than a verbal assurance of this sort
ought to be required.
I was initially denied tenure by my
department, and was given the same
assurance both by the department
and the medical school. It took two
years of intense struggle (during
which my highly productive and well
funded research program was nearly
completely destroyed) and over
535,000 in legal expenses on my part
to cut through the shield of secrecy,
expose the gross violations that had
occurred and to have the decision
reversed.
