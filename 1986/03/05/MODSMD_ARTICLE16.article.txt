## PLO violence intolerable 
### 
In the Feb. 28 issue of The Daily, Nancy Latham argues
in her column that the Palestinian people need a nation.
In constructing her argument, Latham makes numerous
false assertions and cites no facts to support her state
ments. This warrants a response.
Latham claims that she is not pro-terrorist, but in sup
porting the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and
its cause, she must be. One cannot support the purported
"benign" objectives of such a group without endorsing the
malevolent means by which it goes about achieving its ob
jectives. The PLO continues to support and participate in
vicious terrorism in Israel and throughout the world.

Just recently, several members of the PLO, disguised in
Israeli military uniforms, penetrated the Lebanese-Israeli
border, carrying arms, munitions and maps of a nearby
Israeli settlement. Had they not been intercepted by Is
raeli patrols, these terrorists would have proceeded to
their target to slaughter innocent civilians, and such an ac
tion would have been praised by the Arab world. Latham
fails to see the difference between Palestinian terrorism
and Israeli defensive or retaliatory response.
She claims that Israel participates in terrorist activities,
but where is her proof of this? Latham fails to cite one ex
ample of so-called Israeli ''terrorism." There is a distinct
difference between terrorism and legitimate -military
response. Terrorists seldom target Israeli military installa
tions, but instead attack only innocent civilians who
not necessarily even Israeli. One need only reflect on the
recent European airport atrocities by radical Palestinians
to understand that Palestinian terrorism is not only a
threat to Israel but to the entire free world.
Israeli military action seeks out only those guilty of ter
rorism and does not intentionally punish civilians. It is not
Israel's fault if Palestinian terrorists insist on positioning
their bases in the midst of densely populated civilian
centers. When a criminal being chased by policemen hides
behind a woman holding a baby, who is the guilty party,
the policemen or the criminal? If the Palestinian people
wish the world to help them with their problem, their rep
resentatives must approach the matter in a more civilized,
rational and acceptable way.
It is quite true that the sticking point in the Middle East
peace process is the failure of the PLO to accept U.N.
Resolutions 242 and 338, which recognize Israel's
legitimate right to exist as a free nation. It seems ludicrous
for the PLO not to endorse these resolutions when the
Palestinian people stand to gain so much if the PLO does
accept them. If the PLO really is serious about peace, why
doesn't it just accept the resolutions and put the ball in the
court of the U.S. and Israeli governments? One thing is
certain — no progress will be made until such resolutions
are accepted.
How can the Israeli government negotiate with an or
ganization whose charter calls for the annihilation of Is

rael? Recently, King Hussein of Jordan, in a very sincere
attempt, tried to convince Yasser Arafat of this, but
failed. If the PLO is the chosen representative of the Pal
estinian people, the burden of progress rests on its
shoulder. Personally, I wonder if the PLO really is the
chosen representative of the Palestinian people.
Whenever new Palestinian leaders express a more liberal
opinion, they are eliminated. Just recently, a Palestinian
mayor of a city in the occupied West Bank territory was
assassinated by right-wing Palestinians for allegedly
"collaborating" with the Israeli government. How can
progress be made when optimistic, productive Palestinian
opinions are silenced as soon as they are voiced?
It might also be argued that the Palestinians already
have a nation of their own. Seventy percent of the popula
tion of Jordan consists of Palestinians. Why aren't Pales
tinians of the West Bank accepted by their Jordanian kin
into Jordan-proper? Let us also not forget that 18 of the
19 countries in the immediate Middle East are Arab. Why
should Israel, which takes up less than 1 percent of the
total land in the Middle East, take territorial responsibil
ity of a people when so many large Arab countries take up
the other 99 percent of the land?
It seems that support by Arab countries for their Pales
tinian kin is hypocritical. Why can't these wealthy Arab
countries offer just a small portion of their vast real estate
to their Palestinian brothers instead of money and weap
ons, which only increase conflict and tension? The sad an
swer is that nobody wants the Palestinians, and most
Arabs would rather fund or participate in a bloody war to
destroy Israel than offer rational, realistic, or helpful al
ternatives.
Israel has already made great sacrifices for the sake of
peace and in order to make progress with the Palestinian
problem — including withdrawal from the Sinai Penin
sula, land richly endowed with oil and other natural re
sources. The simple fact of the matter is that Israel can't
afford to give up any more of her territory. After all, the
West Bank is only eight short miles from the Mediter
ranean Sea in the most extreme case. If Israel were to give
up the West Bank, she would risk the threat of literally
being split in two. Israel, and the Unites States for that
matter, cannot risk such a possibility. Israel is the United
State's only loyal ally in the entire region, and her location
has vital strategic importance.
In short, any solution to the Palestinian problem which
potentially threatens the existence of Israel is an ex
tremely sensitive matter that requires a fair and complete
analysis of all the facts. Latham fails to address these facts
in her column. Any legitimate attempts to understand or
solve the Palestinian problem require a responsible and
fair assessment of all facts and of all concerned view
points. Until this happens and until the Palestinian people
have leaders who represent their case in a peaceful, ra
tional fashion, there will unfortunately be no progress in
solving the Palestinian problem.

peace and in order to make progress with the Palestinian
problem — including withdrawal from the Sinai Penin
sula, land richly endowed with oil and other natural re
sources. The simple fact of the matter is that Israel can't
afford to give up any more of her territory. After all, the
West Bank is only eight short miles from the Mediter
ranean Sea in the most extreme case. If Israel were to give
up the West Bank, she would risk the threat of literally
being split in two. Israel, and the Unites States for that
matter, cannot risk such a possibility. Israel is the United
State's only loyal ally in the entire region, and her location
has vital strategic importance.
In short, any solution to the Palestinian problem which
potentially threatens the existence of Israel is an ex
tremely sensitive matter that requires a fair and complete
analysis of all the facts. Latham fails to address these facts
in her column. Any legitimate attempts to understand or
solve the Palestinian problem require a responsible and
fair assessment of all facts and of all concerned view
points. Until this happens and until the Palestinian people
have leaders who represent their case in a peaceful, ra
tional fashion, there will unfortunately be no progress in
solving the Palestinian problem.

In the Feb. 28 issue of The Daily, Nancy Latham argues
in her column that the Palestinian people need a nation.
In constructing her argument, Latham makes numerous
false assertions and cites no facts to support her state
ments. This warrants a response.
Latham claims that she is not pro-terrorist, but in sup
porting the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and
its cause, she must be. One cannot support the purported
"benign" objectives of such a group without endorsing the
malevolent means by which it goes about achieving its ob
jectives. The PLO continues to support and participate in
vicious terrorism in Israel and throughout the world.

Just recently, several members of the PLO, disguised in
Israeli military uniforms, penetrated the Lebanese-Israeli
border, carrying arms, munitions and maps of a nearby
Israeli settlement. Had they not been intercepted by Is
raeli patrols, these terrorists would have proceeded to
their target to slaughter innocent civilians, and such an ac
tion would have been praised by the Arab world. Latham
fails to see the difference between Palestinian terrorism
and Israeli defensive or retaliatory response.
She claims that Israel participates in terrorist activities,
but where is her proof of this? Latham fails to cite one ex
ample of so-called Israeli ''terrorism." There is a distinct
difference between terrorism and legitimate -military
response. Terrorists seldom target Israeli military installa
tions, but instead attack only innocent civilians who
not necessarily even Israeli. One need only reflect on the
recent European airport atrocities by radical Palestinians
to understand that Palestinian terrorism is not only a
threat to Israel but to the entire free world.
Israeli military action seeks out only those guilty of ter
rorism and does not intentionally punish civilians. It is not
Israel's fault if Palestinian terrorists insist on positioning
their bases in the midst of densely populated civilian
centers. When a criminal being chased by policemen hides
behind a woman holding a baby, who is the guilty party,
the policemen or the criminal? If the Palestinian people
wish the world to help them with their problem, their rep
resentatives must approach the matter in a more civilized,
rational and acceptable way.
It is quite true that the sticking point in the Middle East
peace process is the failure of the PLO to accept U.N.
Resolutions 242 and 338, which recognize Israel's
legitimate right to exist as a free nation. It seems ludicrous
for the PLO not to endorse these resolutions when the
Palestinian people stand to gain so much if the PLO does
accept them. If the PLO really is serious about peace, why
doesn't it just accept the resolutions and put the ball in the
court of the U.S. and Israeli governments? One thing is
certain — no progress will be made until such resolutions
are accepted.
How can the Israeli government negotiate with an or
ganization whose charter calls for the annihilation of Is

rael? Recently, King Hussein of Jordan, in a very sincere
attempt, tried to convince Yasser Arafat of this, but
failed. If the PLO is the chosen representative of the Pal
estinian people, the burden of progress rests on its
shoulder. Personally, I wonder if the PLO really is the
chosen representative of the Palestinian people.
Whenever new Palestinian leaders express a more liberal
opinion, they are eliminated. Just recently, a Palestinian
mayor of a city in the occupied West Bank territory was
assassinated by right-wing Palestinians for allegedly
"collaborating" with the Israeli government. How can
progress be made when optimistic, productive Palestinian
opinions are silenced as soon as they are voiced?
It might also be argued that the Palestinians already
have a nation of their own. Seventy percent of the popula
tion of Jordan consists of Palestinians. Why aren't Pales
tinians of the West Bank accepted by their Jordanian kin
into Jordan-proper? Let us also not forget that 18 of the
19 countries in the immediate Middle East are Arab. Why
should Israel, which takes up less than 1 percent of the
total land in the Middle East, take territorial responsibil
ity of a people when so many large Arab countries take up
the other 99 percent of the land?
It seems that support by Arab countries for their Pales
tinian kin is hypocritical. Why can't these wealthy Arab
countries offer just a small portion of their vast real estate
to their Palestinian brothers instead of money and weap
ons, which only increase conflict and tension? The sad an
swer is that nobody wants the Palestinians, and most
Arabs would rather fund or participate in a bloody war to
destroy Israel than offer rational, realistic, or helpful al
ternatives.
