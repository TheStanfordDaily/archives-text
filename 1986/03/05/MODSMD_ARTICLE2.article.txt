# State Dept. officer talks on terrorism

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Calling terrorism an interna
tional problem, the U.S. State De
partment's director of diplomatic
security service said here last night
that the United States "has a lim
ited ability to influence the
(terrorism) situation abroad."
David Fields told approximately
25 people in Branner Hall that
despite increased intelligence ef
forts and beefed-up security at
U.S. embassies, the United States
is limited in the action it can take
against terrorist organizations.
"We cannot arbitrarily land as
sault troops at the airport of a
friendly country," Fields said,
adding that the United States can
not control the policies and actions
of other countries.
International cooperation is re
quired to curtail and prevent the
increasing number of terrorist
strikes in Europe and the Middle
East, Fields said. He noted that
there were "about 900" terrorism
incidents in 1985, almost a 60 per
cent increase since 1983.
While only seven of the 900 ter
rorist acts occurred in the United
States, Fields said Americans

are particularly susceptible targets
of international terrorism.
"We're so present abroad," he
said, citing the large number of
U.S. tourists and business opera
tions in Europe and the Middle
East. In addition, Fields said
terrorist organizations see U.S.
policies as controlling the situa
tions in their countries.
Fields also noted an increase in
what he called "state-sponsored
terrorism," naming Iran, Libya,
Syria and Cuba as the leading
countries involved in such opera
tions. Such countries provide
arms, training and communication
technologies to terrorist organiza
tions, making state-sponsored
groups "more deadly than the run
of-the-mill terrorists," he said.
Abu Nidal, a group claiming re
sponsibility for the December
bombing of airports in Vienna and
Rome, is allegedly supported by
the Libyan government, Fields
said. Five Americans were killed
in those attacks.
Economic sanctions imposed by
the United States on Libya after
the incidents, while sometimes
"easy to overcome," are an impor-
tant part of U.S. efforts to combat state-sponsored ter
rorism.
"At a point you have to do something. Sometimes it's
morally right to take an action that at least expresses your
dissatisfaction," he said.
Actions to protect U.S. diplomats and citizens at em
bassies abroad are being increased, Fields said, noting that
the number of personnel protecting such sites has doubled
in the last year.
Other efforts to fortify embassies include the construc
tion of walls in front of buildings and the installation of
bullet-proof windows, he said.
Fields praised the recent efforts of some European and
Mediterranean countries, including Italy and West Ger
many, to improve security at airports and take tougher
policies in dealing with terrorists.
A decrease in tourist-generated revenue to such
countries is a principle cause of such efforts, Fields said.
He cited the Novemeber hijacking of the cruise ship
Achille Lauro by Abu Nidal as a particular blow to
Mediterranean tourism.
European nations have also discovered that they cannot
rely on unwritten agreements with terrorists and countries
sponsoring terrorist groups, Fields said.
"Sometimes they think they can have a gentleman's
agreement with terrorists I think recently that
European governments found out that most terrorists are
not gentlemen," he said, adding that terrorists "are not
the kind of romantic freedom fighters that some people
claim."
"We really didn't get anyone's attention until after the
TWA hijacking," he said, referring to the June 1984
hijacking of TWA flight 847 in Lebanon that received
heavy media coverage.
