## Poetry at its very Berry best 
### STEVE STREED Staff writer 
Poet and novelist Wendell Berry, who
read from his works Monday night to a
packed Annenberg Auditorium, spoke at a
colloquium yesterday morning in the En
glish Department lounge about literature
and agriculture.
Berry, who came to Stanford this week as
part of the Jean and Bill Lane lecture series,
has written over a dozen collections of
poetry and essays, three books on
agriculture and several novels about Ken
tucky, including "Nathan Coulter."
He was a Stegner Fellow of creative
writing at Stanford in 1965 and spent a year
in Italy writing as a Guggenheim Fellow.
Wallace Stegner, the founder of Stan
ford's creative writing program, introduced
Berry at the Annenberg reading as a writer
who, "like a dog lying down, circled around
a little" before he began farming his family's
75-acre farm in Kentucky and writing about
the area.
During the hour-and-15-minute collo
quium, Berry credited American-place writ
ers Henry David Thoreau and William
Carlos Williams as inspirations for his work.
He also called the controversial poet Ezra
Pound "a constant help" to his thinking and
writing, and he cited works by Shakespeare,
Emily Dickenson and Norman Maclean as
examples for his work.
Berry compared writing to farming,
saying the artist is always trying to im
prove his work but also has "a helpless
dependence on what he doesn't provide,"
namely, inspiration. The farmer, too, is con
tinually striving to improve his farming tech
niques, but must count on the weather as a
force beyond his control.
Berry repeatedly emphasized the value of

sticking with a situation and not fleeing from
it.
"As Americans we think we can pull out
and start something new. That's what we
learned from the frontier experience.
Americans have got to get over the juvenile
feeling they have that you can solve your
problems by changing places. One thing we
can realize is that when you change places
you change the place of your problems," he
said.

'As Americans we
think we can pull out
and start something
new. That's what we
learned from the
frontier experience.'

Berry illustrated his "if you don't stay
you don't remember your mistakes" dicturi
with examples from his own life. He said hi
moves to New York, California and Ital;
contributed to his spending "a lot of tim
grieving over the failure of life to live up t<
my expectations."
This series of moves helped him obtain
certain amount of disillusionment," whicl
then helped him value both "staying with it'
and having a locale with a living culture.
Later on, he discussed the art of writini
about places so as to make them "true-to
life."
"Staying with" a situation can prove "ricl

in revelation," he said, adding that if an art
ist writes from this revelation "it is possible
to describe an exemplary person or place."
An artist has to "assemble a number of
memories" about his subject, whether it be a
place, a person or a mode of living. He must
then work with these memories in his mind
as he attempts to realize them in his art and
learn from them.
Berry said he thought there are "great ar
tists who pass through this world and no one
ever knows about it" He cited an example
from Norman Maclean's book about Mon
tana life, "A River Run's Through It," in
which Maclean described his brother as a
"major artist" at fly fishing.
Berry quoted from author Erik Gill,
saying, "We're all called to give love to the
work of our hands, from the symphony to
the sewer pipe." Berry said he felt a
successful culture would have people who
were artists no matter what their profession.
An artist could be a shoemaker or a person
who lay down sewer pipes in such a fashion
that the pipes themselves were works of art.
Berry also discussed Amish culture.
"The Amish produce as many geniuses as
any people," he said. Sometimes in the grain
belt of the Northern New England states,
"you will see a genius farming an 80-acre
farm . . . and that makes a pretty good
farm," he said.
Berry described himself as a place-writer
who is concerned about the demise of small
farming and the misuse of English that con
tributes to that demise. For example, when
agriculturists call a small farm an "asset,"
then selling a small farm has the same
redeeming value to them as farming a small
farm, he said.
However, Berry identifies farming as a
way of life and not merely a source of
income.
