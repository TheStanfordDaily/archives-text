### DINESH VAZIRANI Staff writer photos by SARAH ROSENBAUM 
Some are hard-working, studious
and intense. Others are laid-back and
suntanned. Some study out on Wilbur
Field, lounging on their beach chairs
and wearing their Vuarnets, while
others hole up in the depths of Green
to do their studying.
One thing's for sure — the typical
student on the Farm is not easy to

describe. Indeed, what exactly are the
prominent characteristics of the typi
cal Stanford student?
"They are slightly neurotic, pam
pered but generally friendly."
— Mike Marmor, graduate student
"Stanford students are highly
motivated, very independent and also
have this strong desire to party."
— Peter Siphron, senior
"They've got plenty of stamina.

1 hey stay up all the time and get no
sleep. Most of them seem rather un
dernourished. I wonder if it's got
anything to do with the food service
on campus."
— Lynelle Bautista, junior
'Conservative, studious beach
bums, many of whom like to party
hard."
— Mark Foxton, freshman
"They are laid-back, carefree and
mellow."
— Andrew Hartell, graduate student

"Most Stanford students are lost in
their own world. Generally, they are
very intelligent, but many of them are
closed to the outside world."
— Lisa Rau, law student
"A smart, laid-back, relaxed bunch
of people."
— Gina Paige, sophomore
"I guess they excell in some partic
ular area, and are very involved."
— Ray Buchmann, sophomore
