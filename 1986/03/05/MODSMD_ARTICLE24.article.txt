## Improve your memory with associations 
### VLADINA HESS 
While Stanford students are busy
learning their studies, Gordon
Bower, professor of psychology,
studies how we learn. "I am an ex
perimental psychologist interested in
human learning and memory,"
Bower said.
Bower works with six to seven
graduate and post-doctoral students,
conducting specific experiments on
memory and learning. This in-depth
research is based on the results of
earlier, more general work which ex
plored practical approaches to im
proving memory.
In the field of study called
mnemonics, Bower looked at how
one could greatly improve memory of
names, faces, lists, pictures, errands,
topics in a speech, points in a book,
etc.
The trick is to use what is known as
the "retrieval scheme," according to
Bower. "The techniques rely on
visualization and association," he
said, adding that the retrieval scheme
is a way to systematically store and
cue oneself to retrieve items from
memory.
To remember ideas, Bower said
that one should first convert the ideas
into symbols which suggest these
ideas. For example, if one wanted to
remember a grocery list, one would
try to visualize the various items
which needed to be bought.
If the list were a set of ideas in a
speech, one would want to think of a

symbol which represented the idea. If
the speech talked about the nature of
democracy, someone might choose
the image of a voting ballot as a sym
bol for democracy. Another person

might visualize the Statue of Liberty.
Bower said the point is to pick a
symbol which best represents the idea
in one's own mind.
The next step, according to Bower,

is to remember the ideas or symbols
in a certain order. To do this, one
chooses a certain geographic route,
for example, a bike ride to school, a
walk to the post office or the trip back

home, and associates each symbol
with a certain location along the geo
graphic route.
So, if one were trying to remember
a shopping list, choosing as the geo

graphic route the bike ride to school,
one would visualize the first item,
perhaps sandwich bread, and the first
point on his geographic route, the
front door. The key is to make a vis
ual association in one's mind between
sandwich bread and door.
Maybe one imagines a door plas
tered with slices of sandwich bread,
or one's door as a slice of bread. One
should now stop for five seconds to
mentally hold that image, according
to Bower.
The next item on the list is soda
pop. One visualizes his bicycle as a
two-wheeled Pepsi can. The list can
go on and on.
People can remember hundreds of
things this way, according to Bower.
This method, known as the "method
of loci," or routes and locations, relies
on the use of known retrieval pegs
onto which one can hook ideas. The
system works, Bower said, because
"our memory is associative."
Another method which aids
memory is the "pegword method,"
Bower said. This is similar to the
method of loci. But instead of choos
ing a route and associating symbols
with points on the route, one has an
ordered list of images or "pegwords"
upon which one can "hook on" the
appropriate symbol through associa
tion.
A list of pegwords could include
words like cat, tree, phone, etc.
