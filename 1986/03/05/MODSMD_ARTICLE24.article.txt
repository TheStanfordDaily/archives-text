## Improve your memory with associations 
### VLADINA HESS 
While Stanford students are busy
learning their studies, Gordon
Bower, professor of psychology,
studies how we learn. "I am an ex
perimental psychologist interested in
human learning and memory,"
Bower said.
Bower works with six to seven
graduate and post-doctoral students,
conducting specific experiments on
memory and learning. This in-depth
research is based on the results of
earlier, more general work which ex
plored practical approaches to im
proving memory.
In the field of study called
mnemonics, Bower looked at how
one could greatly improve memory of
names, faces, lists, pictures, errands,
topics in a speech, points in a book,
etc.
The trick is to use what is known as
the "retrieval scheme," according to
Bower. "The techniques rely on
visualization and association," he
said, adding that the retrieval scheme
is a way to systematically store and
cue oneself to retrieve items from
memory.
To remember ideas, Bower said
that one should first convert the ideas
into symbols which suggest these
ideas. For example, if one wanted to
remember a grocery list, one would
try to visualize the various items
which needed to be bought.
If the list were a set of ideas in a
speech, one would want to think of a

symbol which represented the idea. If
the speech talked about the nature of
democracy, someone might choose
the image of a voting ballot as a sym
bol for democracy. Another person

might visualize the Statue of Liberty.
Bower said the point is to pick a
symbol which best represents the idea
in one's own mind.
The next step, according to Bower,

is to remember the ideas or symbols
in a certain order. To do this, one
chooses a certain geographic route,
for example, a bike ride to school, a
walk to the post office or the trip back

home, and associates each symbol
with a certain location along the geo
graphic route.
So, if one were trying to remember
a shopping list, choosing as the geo

graphic route the bike ride to school,
one would visualize the first item,
perhaps sandwich bread, and the first
point on his geographic route, the
front door. The key is to make a vis
ual association in one's mind between
sandwich bread and door.
Maybe one imagines a door plas
tered with slices of sandwich bread,
or one's door as a slice of bread. One
should now stop for five seconds to
mentally hold that image, according
to Bower.
The next item on the list is soda
pop. One visualizes his bicycle as a
two-wheeled Pepsi can. The list can
go on and on.
People can remember hundreds of
things this way, according to Bower.
This method, known as the "method
of loci," or routes and locations, relies
on the use of known retrieval pegs
onto which one can hook ideas. The
system works, Bower said, because
"our memory is associative."
Another method which aids
memory is the "pegword method,"
Bower said. This is similar to the
method of loci. But instead of choos
ing a route and associating symbols
with points on the route, one has an
ordered list of images or "pegwords"
upon which one can "hook on" the
appropriate symbol through associa
tion.
A list of pegwords could include
words like cat, tree, phone, etc.

Again, if memorizing a grocery list,
one would "associate" or visualize
sandwich bread with one of the peg
words. People can make different sets
of pegwords or loci for each class of
things which need to be memorized.
Bower said.
Bower has also studied why people
remember certain things better than
others. He found that memory is con
nected to emotions. On the whole,
people remember pleasant things bet
ter than unpleasant things, he ex
plained.
Recall depends on how much emo
tional arousal occurred at the time of
the event, and how much a person
replayed the event in his mind. If an
event aroused much emotion in the
form of happiness, sadness or anger,
the chances are that the person will
replay the event over in his mind
several times. This will reinforce it in
his memory. If the same emotion is
rekindled at a later time, an as
sociative connection will be made, and
one will remember the previous
similar events associated with that
emotion.
Bower has also studied factors
which influence memory, specifically
the effects of mood. The experiments
were done with Stanford students
who were paid volunteers. The main
experiments asked students to re
member two separate lists of words
while in two different moods, not
using mnemonics. One list was
learned while in a "happy" mood and
the other while in a "sad" mood.
Moods were created by playing
either happy or sad music and asking
students to think of things which cor

responded with the mood of the
music and would make them happy or
sad.
After both lists under the different
moods were learned, the students
were divided into two groups. Half
were placed back in the "happy"
state and were asked to recall both
lists of words, and half were placed
back in the "sad" state and were also
asked to recall both lists.
Students in the "happy" recall
mood could remember more from the
list of words they learned while happy
than the list of words they learned
while sad, and vice versa for the stu
dents in the sad recall mood. This is
known, according to Bower, as
"mood-dependent retrieval."
Bower discovered a bigger gap
when mood was created during the
experiment. Instead of a list of words
to learn, students were given a set of
situations and asked to imagine such
things as getting an 'A' on a test, re
ceiving a Stanford acceptance letter
or getting a new car. The emotional
reaction caused by this kind of learn
ing created a very strong association
once in the recall mood, Bower said.
Bower followed these results into
other areas, looking at how mood af
fects judgements, estimations and
predictions. The results, according to
Bower, were that all of these were as
sociated with emotion. If one was
happy, then judgements, estimations
or predictions tended to be more pos
itive than if one was sad.
Bower gave one example of asking
students to make up a story about a
photograph with a man and a woman
in it."The stories you get vary with
mood," Bower said. If angry, a per
son might say that the couple is ar
guing, whereas a sad person might say
that the couple is distressed.
