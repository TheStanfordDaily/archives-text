# Science takes on alcoholism
## 
### 
The treatment of alcoholism must
be more flexible than in the past and
must be measured carefully for effec
tiveness, according to the co-directors
of Stanford's new alcohol and drug
treatment center.

Family status, work settings, life
stresses, socio-demographic factors
and personality all affect treatment
outcome and must be taken into ac
count.

Dr. Robert A. Matano and Dr.
William Hazle, who structured Stan
ford's recent second annual confer
ence on alcoholism around that
theme, have built Stanford's new unit
on those principles as well.
Already accepting outpatients, the
Stanford unit features short-term
detoxification and long-term, well
organized outpatient counseling and
medical care. The official opening of
the unit, a joint arrangement between
the hospital and the department of
psychiatry, is expected in about a
month.
"We're seeing that the cookie
cutter approach of the past may not
have been as effective," said Matano,
a psychologist and program director
of the Stanford center.
Alcohol treatment programs previ
ously have been shaped more by

reimbursement policies than by
medicine, Matanosaid.
"The treatment of alcoholism cur
rently lacks the core scientific base
common to other areas of medicine,"
agreed Hazle, the psychiatrist who is

medical director of Stanford's alcohol
clinic.
As a social disgrace, alcoholism
was shunned by mainline society —
including medicine. Treatment of the
disease was left to organizations such
as Alcoholics Anonymous and the
Salvation Army, Hazel explained,
"and only now is the science begin
ning to catch up."
Statistics presented during the day
long conference "Evaluating the Ef
fectiveness of Alcohol and Drug
Treatment" on Feb. 14 supported the
Stanford researchers' views.
"We need to realize that [patients']
life context affects everything," Dr.
John Finney told the 140 physicians,
therapists and employee assistance
personnel attending the Stanford
conference.
Family status, work settings, life

stresses, socio-demographic factors
and personality all affect treatment
outcome and must be taken into ac
count, said Finney, a research associ
ate in the department of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences at the Veter
ans' Administration Medical Center
in Palo Alto.
"We need a more differentiated
view of treatment," he said, stressing
that many factors must be monitored
and recorded in order to evaluate
programs seeking to rehabilitate al
coholics.
Dr. Joseph Frawley, medical direc
tor of the Schick Shadel Hospital in
Southern California, agreed.
"Before we can establish treat
ment," he said, "we have to come to a
prognostic idea of how well the indi
vidual will do.
"Knowing the reasonable outcome

'The treatment of alcoholism currently
lacks the core scientific base common
to other areas of medicine.'
— Dr. William Hazle, co-director of
the new Stanford treatment center

is a part of the standard treatment of
any disease," including alcoholism,
he continued.
Drawing parallels between treating
an alcoholic and rehabilitating a pa-

tient who has had a stroke, Frawley
called for greater precision in record
ing alcohol-related complications as
an aid to patients' recovery.
Gauging a patient's alcohol con
sumption is tricky, but necessary, said
Dr. Lorraine Midanik, assistant pro
fessor at the UC-Berkeley's School of
Social Welfare.
Midanik urged those who treat al
coholics to try to determine the indi
vidual's drinking pattern.
"Don't ask only what quantity they
drink," she said,"but how it affects
the person's life." More accurate
questions, such as asking about the
most alcohol consumed in a single in
cident and the frequency of drinking,
will help establish a pattern, Midanik
said.
But predicting the damage alcohol
will do is difficult, observed Dr.
Kevin Olden, medical director of the

Pacific Recovery Center, as he
detailed the impact of medical prob
lems on the recovery process.
Amounts that cripple some people
may leave others virtually unscathed.
