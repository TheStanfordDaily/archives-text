## It's 11 and counting for Card vs. Spartans Kunkel seven-hitter leads Stanford to a 7-2 road triumph 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE — And the beat goes on . . . and on. Yester
day at San Jose's Municipal Stadium, Stanford whipped
San Jose State for the fifth consecutive time this year, 7-2.
Sure, the loss was the Spartans' 1 Ith straight against the
Cardinal — but the Spartans' losing skein against
Stanford shouldn't be measured in mere games. Hey,
we're talking years here.
SJSU hasn't managed a win against Stanford since Feb.
10, 1984. That's two years . . . and counting. The Spartans
won 6-3 at Sunken Diamond on a ninth-inning home run
way back when.
Stanford, ranked seventh in the country by a Baseball
America poll released Monday, improved to IS-6, while
SJSU fell to 5-13.
Yesterday it was Kevin Kunkel's turn to shackle the
hapless Spartans. The senior right-hander from Leonardo,
N.J., went all the way for Stanford to notch his first win of
the year. He came into the game carrying a 7.71 earned
run average to go with two losses.
Kunkel scattered seven hits along the way and gave up
two runs, one earned. He struck out three and walked one
while establishing himself as the only Stanford starting
pitcher besides Jack Mc Dowell to record a complete game
this year.
"I had plenty of confidence out there today," Kunkel
said. "The first couple of innings 1 was a little shaky, but I
settled down after that."
Kunkel surrendered a pair of singles in the bottom of
the first but escaped when he popped third baseman Gary
Dorsey up to shallow right.
After retiring the first two batters in the SJSU third,
Kunkel ran into trouble. Left fielder Steve Ochoa fol
lowed a base hit by Dorsey with a line single to center.
Dorsey scored and Ochoa moved to second when the ball
went under center fielder Mark Davis' glove.
Earl Boles followed with an RBI single to make the
score 2-0.
"1 was getting some of my pitches up in those first in
nings," Kunkel said. "As with any pitcher, it's important
that 1 keep the ball down."
After his rocky third inning, Kunkel settled down and
blanked the Spartans the rest of the way. He retired 19 of
the last 22 batters he faced and didn't allow more than
one base runner in an inning thereafter.

"I started throwing the changeup out there today and
got four, maybe five, outs with that pitch," Kunkel said.
"I've got to change speeds because all my other pitches
are about the same speed. My changeup sort of augments
everything else." 1
Stanford, shutout through the first four innings by SJSU
starter Dan Graham, erupted with four runs in the fifth.

Graham hit Ed Sprague with a pitch to lead off the in
ning. Ron Witmeyer, a freshman who entered the game
with a .444 batting average in 18 at-bats, singled to right,
moving Sprague to second. Shortstop Frank Carey, an
other freshman, laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance the
runners.
Walt Harris, whose batting average has dipped under

.300 for the first time in more than a month, sliced a single
to right field, scoring Sprague. Witmeyer, unsure whether
the ball would drop, held at second.
Ruben Amaro then grounded a single between first and
second to score Witmeyer with the tying run. Amaro's
roller slipped past the charging right fielder, allowing Har
ris to come across with the go-ahead run.
Mark Davis' single to left plated Amaro and drove
Graham, 1-3, to the showers. Anthony Telford came to
get the last two outs, but by that time it was 4-2 Stanford.
The Cardinal scored single runs in the sixth, seventh
and eighth innings to pad its lead. In the sixth, Witmeyer,
who had doubled, scored on Carey's single.
Amaro tripled to lead off the the seventh and scored an
out later on John Ramos' sacrifice fly to center. Harris
drove in Witmeyer, who reached on an error by Dorsey,
with Stanford's last run in the eighth.
After playing nine games the past 11 days, the Cardinal
will take the next two days off before hosting UCLA in a
three-game Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division se
ries beginning Friday at 2 p.m.
The Cardinal opened Six-Pac play last weekend by
taking two of three games from Arizona at the Wildcats'
Sancet Park. Meanwhile, the Bruins dropped two of three
to Arizona State in Tempe.
In the other Six-Pac series played last weekend, Cali
fornia swept the first two games from USC and lead 9-0
early in the series finale. But then the Trojans finally came
to life, storming back to win 12-10. The loss kept the
Bears from taking sole possession of the conference lead.
Card notes
Right fielder Toi Cook, although he didn't start yester
day, has raised his season batting average to .293 — after
starting in a 1-for-13 slump. . . . Jugs guns in Tucson,
Ariz., last Friday once clocked McDowell's fastball at 89
mph. He consistently registered readings in the 86-88
mph range. Jim Price, a freshman right-hander, threw in
the 90s in high school.
The Cardinal is two games behind its early-season pace
of a year ago. After 21 games last year, Stanford stood at
17-4.
Davis, Ramos and Doug Rohbins share the team lead in
RBIs with 17 apiece. After a 2-for-4 outing yesterday,
Witmeyer leads the team in hitting with a .455 average.
Among players with more than 25 at-bats. Lance Shebelut
is on top with a .333 mark, followed by Ramos at .329 and
Robbins at .327.
In addition to Stanford's No. 7 ranking, three other Six-
Pac teams are among the nation's top 25, according to
Baseball America. Cal is ranked fourth, while Arizona is
15th and Arizona State 20th.

won 6-3 at Sunken Diamond on a ninth-inning home run
way back when.
Stanford, ranked seventh in the country by a Baseball
America poll released Monday, improved to IS-6, while
SJSU fell to 5-13.
Yesterday it was Kevin Kunkel's turn to shackle the
hapless Spartans. The senior right-hander from Leonardo,
N.J., went all the way for Stanford to notch his first win of
the year. He came into the game carrying a 7.71 earned
run average to go with two losses.
Kunkel scattered seven hits along the way and gave up
two runs, one earned. He struck out three and walked one
while establishing himself as the only Stanford starting
pitcher besides Jack Mc Dowell to record a complete game
this year.
"I had plenty of confidence out there today," Kunkel
said. "The first couple of innings 1 was a little shaky, but I
settled down after that."
Kunkel surrendered a pair of singles in the bottom of
the first but escaped when he popped third baseman Gary
Dorsey up to shallow right.
After retiring the first two batters in the SJSU third,
Kunkel ran into trouble. Left fielder Steve Ochoa fol
lowed a base hit by Dorsey with a line single to center.
Dorsey scored and Ochoa moved to second when the ball
went under center fielder Mark Davis' glove.
Earl Boles followed with an RBI single to make the
score 2-0.
"1 was getting some of my pitches up in those first in
nings," Kunkel said. "As with any pitcher, it's important
that 1 keep the ball down."
After his rocky third inning, Kunkel settled down and
blanked the Spartans the rest of the way. He retired 19 of
the last 22 batters he faced and didn't allow more than
one base runner in an inning thereafter.

"I started throwing the changeup out there today and
got four, maybe five, outs with that pitch," Kunkel said.
"I've got to change speeds because all my other pitches
are about the same speed. My changeup sort of augments
everything else." 1
Stanford, shutout through the first four innings by SJSU
starter Dan Graham, erupted with four runs in the fifth.

Graham hit Ed Sprague with a pitch to lead off the in
ning. Ron Witmeyer, a freshman who entered the game
with a .444 batting average in 18 at-bats, singled to right,
moving Sprague to second. Shortstop Frank Carey, an
other freshman, laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance the
runners.
Walt Harris, whose batting average has dipped under

.300 for the first time in more than a month, sliced a single
to right field, scoring Sprague. Witmeyer, unsure whether
the ball would drop, held at second.
Ruben Amaro then grounded a single between first and
second to score Witmeyer with the tying run. Amaro's
roller slipped past the charging right fielder, allowing Har
ris to come across with the go-ahead run.
Mark Davis' single to left plated Amaro and drove
Graham, 1-3, to the showers. Anthony Telford came to
get the last two outs, but by that time it was 4-2 Stanford.
The Cardinal scored single runs in the sixth, seventh
and eighth innings to pad its lead. In the sixth, Witmeyer,
who had doubled, scored on Carey's single.
Amaro tripled to lead off the the seventh and scored an
out later on John Ramos' sacrifice fly to center. Harris
drove in Witmeyer, who reached on an error by Dorsey,
with Stanford's last run in the eighth.
After playing nine games the past 11 days, the Cardinal
will take the next two days off before hosting UCLA in a
three-game Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division se
ries beginning Friday at 2 p.m.
The Cardinal opened Six-Pac play last weekend by
taking two of three games from Arizona at the Wildcats'
Sancet Park. Meanwhile, the Bruins dropped two of three
to Arizona State in Tempe.
In the other Six-Pac series played last weekend, Cali
fornia swept the first two games from USC and lead 9-0
early in the series finale. But then the Trojans finally came
to life, storming back to win 12-10. The loss kept the
Bears from taking sole possession of the conference lead.
Card notes
Right fielder Toi Cook, although he didn't start yester
day, has raised his season batting average to .293 — after
starting in a 1-for-13 slump. . . . Jugs guns in Tucson,
Ariz., last Friday once clocked McDowell's fastball at 89
mph. He consistently registered readings in the 86-88
mph range. Jim Price, a freshman right-hander, threw in
the 90s in high school.
The Cardinal is two games behind its early-season pace
of a year ago. After 21 games last year, Stanford stood at
17-4.
Davis, Ramos and Doug Rohbins share the team lead in
RBIs with 17 apiece. After a 2-for-4 outing yesterday,
Witmeyer leads the team in hitting with a .455 average.
Among players with more than 25 at-bats. Lance Shebelut
is on top with a .333 mark, followed by Ramos at .329 and
Robbins at .327.
In addition to Stanford's No. 7 ranking, three other Six-
Pac teams are among the nation's top 25, according to
Baseball America. Cal is ranked fourth, while Arizona is
15th and Arizona State 20th.

The time between appearances can be frustrating for a pitcher, but it should not be too much of a problem for
Stanford's Kevin Kunkel based on his performance yesterday against San Jose State. The senior right-hander
held the Spartans to seven hits and one earned run in the Cardinal's 7-2 victory.
SAN JOSE — And the beat goes on . . . and on. Yester
day at San Jose's Municipal Stadium, Stanford whipped
San Jose State for the fifth consecutive time this year, 7-2.
Sure, the loss was the Spartans' 1 Ith straight against the
Cardinal — but the Spartans' losing skein against
Stanford shouldn't be measured in mere games. Hey,
we're talking years here.
