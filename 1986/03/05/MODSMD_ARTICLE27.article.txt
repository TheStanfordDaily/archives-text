# Grabb comes back as Cardinal rolls

Jim Grabb's performance yester
day could be a harbinger of the rest of
the season for the Stanford Cardinal.
Stanford fans should certainly hope
so.
The senior, who due to a nagging
injury had not played a singles match
until yesterday, overcame his rusti
ness with some sharp thinking to
defeat freshman Malcolm Allen in
Stanford's 8-1 victory over the San
Jose State Spartans.
The Cardinal swept the singles
matches while improving its record to
6-1. San Jose dropped to 2-4. I he
Stanford team now has a three-week
layoff before traveling to play
Arizona State and Arizona on March
28 and 29.
Grabb's return to the courts did not
look promising in the first set. He was
not moving as well as he has in the
past, and Allen was fast and on fire,
winning the first set 6-2.
"Jim was hitting some hard shots
down the sides and they were coming

down the middle of the court and
generally played softer.
"That's easy to say, but harder to
do." Gould said of the strategy shift.
"You've still got to remember to at
tack. and Jim was able to do that."
Grabb did it so well, in fact, that he
took the next two sets 6-2, 6-2 to
move his singles record to 1-0.
San Jose Coach John Hubbell had
nothing but good words for Grabb.
"It's good to see him back," he said.
"You could see the difference today
between a four-year veteran and my
19-year-old freshman."
That freshman had some final
praise for Grabb. "He played smart.
He found my weakness — my over
heads are still pretty shaky — so he

The return of Jim Grabb to the singles lineup yesterday was a welcome
sign for the Stanford men's tennis team. Grabb, playing his first singles
match of the season due to injury, overcame a fast start by San Jose
