# Grabb comes back as Cardinal rolls

Jim Grabb's performance yester
day could be a harbinger of the rest of
the season for the Stanford Cardinal.
Stanford fans should certainly hope
so.
The senior, who due to a nagging
injury had not played a singles match
until yesterday, overcame his rusti
ness with some sharp thinking to
defeat freshman Malcolm Allen in
Stanford's 8-1 victory over the San
Jose State Spartans.
The Cardinal swept the singles
matches while improving its record to
6-1. San Jose dropped to 2-4. I he
Stanford team now has a three-week
layoff before traveling to play
Arizona State and Arizona on March
28 and 29.
Grabb's return to the courts did not
look promising in the first set. He was
not moving as well as he has in the
past, and Allen was fast and on fire,
winning the first set 6-2.
"Jim was hitting some hard shots
down the sides and they were coming
back at him even harder and with
more angle on 'em. Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said.
So the two-year Ail-American

decided he had to change the situa
tion. After all, there's nothing in the
rules that says the winner is the one
who hits the hardest.
"I wasn't having much success. I
had to change my game," Grabb said
after the match. "He (Allen) was dic
tating the tempo of the match at that
point."
From that point on, however,
Grabb did the dictating. He changed
the pace of his shots, directed them
down the middle of the court and
generally played softer.
"That's easy to say, but harder to
do." Gould said of the strategy shift.
"You've still got to remember to at
tack. and Jim was able to do that."
Grabb did it so well, in fact, that he
took the next two sets 6-2, 6-2 to
move his singles record to 1-0.
San Jose Coach John Hubbell had
nothing but good words for Grabb.
"It's good to see him back," he said.
"You could see the difference today
between a four-year veteran and my
19-year-old freshman."
That freshman had some final
praise for Grabb. "He played smart.
He found my weakness — my over
heads are still pretty shaky — so he

The return of Jim Grabb to the singles lineup yesterday was a welcome
sign for the Stanford men's tennis team. Grabb, playing his first singles
match of the season due to injury, overcame a fast start by San Jose
State's Malcolm Allen to win 2-6, 6-2, 6-2.
launched up quite a few moonballs,"
Allen said. "I don't have all that
much experience yet, but I'm pretty
damn happy about the way I played.''
The rest of the Stanford squad
turned in good performances as well.
With Cardinal Dan Goldie taking the
day off, Patrick McEnroe played No.
2 singles and breezed past Spartan
Mark Murphy 6-3, 6-1. McEnroe ran
Murphy all over the court while run
ning his undefeated singles record
this year to 7-0.
In No. 3 singles, Stanford senior
Eric Rosenfeld quickly tossed Mar
cello Telia 6-0, 6-3. The fourth
singles match was an even speedier
affair, with Cardinal John Letts
routing Bob Hepner 6-1, 6-1.
Stanford juniors Scott Moody and
Mark Jacobson finished the Cardinal
sweep of the singles by taking the
fifth and sixth matches. Moody
rebounded from a first-set loss to
defeat Tom Sheehan 6-7, 6-4, 6-4.
Jacobson won his second straight
singles match by blanking Paul
Carbone 6-0, 6-0.
Before the match, Gould was con
cerned with the consistency of his
doubles teams' play, and yesterday's
results didn't do much to allay his
fears.

The Stanford coach juggled his
doubles lineup at the last minute.
Grabb and Goldie were scheduled to
play the No. I match, but Gould
scratched them in order to give
Jacobson and junior Geordie McKee
some play.
The Cardinal team of McEnroe
and Letts thus moved up to No. 1 and
fought through bad streaks to edge
Murphy and Carbone 7-5, 6-4.
In the No. 2 doubles, Card
inal players Rosenfeld and Moody
were also up and down throughout
the match. The pair finally got it to
gether in the final set to beat Allen
and Hepner 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.
'That's what I was talking about,"
Gould said. "One set we're in, the
next we're out. We've got to improve
our consistency."
Stanford's only loss of the day
came in the No. 3 doubles. Spartans
Telia and Layne Lyssy came back to
defeat Jacobson and McKee 1-6, 6-0,
6-4.
Card notes
Stanford is currently ranked No. 1
in the nation, but should fall when the
new rankings come out this week.
According to Gould, the Cardinal will
be ranked about fifth or sixth, based
on Stanford's performance in the Na
tional Intercollegiate Indoor Cham
pionships two weeks ago.
Gould believes that Pepperdine
will be ranked first,
