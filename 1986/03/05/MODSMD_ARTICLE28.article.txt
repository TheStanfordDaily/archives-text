# Lichti named to All Pac-10 team
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Stanford freshman Todd Lichti
was one of 10 players named to the
All-Pacific 10 Conference Team for
the 1985-86 season, the conference
office in Walnut Creek announced
yesterday.
Lichti, a 6-foot-4 swingman from
Concord, is the first freshman to
make the all-conference team since
USC's Cliff Robinson did so in
1978. Voting was done by the 10
conference coaches.
"I'm happy to get the award, ob
viously," Lichti said. "I was a little
surprised, but I'm just going to tiy
to take it in stride and not let it af
fect me too much. I thought I had a
chance, but I wasn't sure about the
outcome."
Lichti's selection did come as a
surprise to some because he had
been overlooked for the Pac-10's
Freshman of the Year award, which
was announced last week. UCLA
guard Pooh Richardson and
Arizona forward Sean Elliott tied
for that honor, but neither was
named to the all-league team.
Lichti did join Richardson, Elliott
and USC's Tom Lewis and Bo
Kimble on the conference All-
Freshman Team.
"I was a little surprised, seeing
how the All-Freshman Team voting
went, but it's nice to receive some
thing," Lichti said.
"I was talking to Todd about it,"
coach Tom Davis said, "and what I
think it was is that when the coaches
are voting for the all-conference
team, they look up and down the
league — see who deserves to make
it from Oregon State, who deserves
to make it from UCLA. I think
when they got to Stanford, Todd
Lichti was the name that came up."
"It's great for Todd," senior for
ward Andy Fischer said. "It may be
more important than Freshman of
the Year. He's definitely our most
valuable player."
Nine of the conference's 10
schools were represented on the
team. Washington center Chris
Welp headed the list as the Pac-10
Player of the Year. He and UCLA
forward Reggie Miller were the only
unanimous selections.
Rounding out the squad are USC
forward Derrick Dowell. Washing
ton forward Paul Fortier. Oregon
State center Jose Ortiz, California
guard Kevin Johnson. Washington
State guard Keith Morrison.
Arizona guard Steve Kerr and
Oregon forward Jerry Adams. No
Arizona State player made the
team.
Lichti came in this year as the
most highly touted of five freshmen
that Davis signed last vear, but

opened the season on the heneh at
small forward behind Fischer. By
the Cardinal's sixth game at Har
vard in mid-December, he was in
the starting lineup for good.

who had replaced Steve Brown in
the lineup, missed four games with a
pulled back muscle. Lichti moved

over to the guard position. He has
split time between guard and for
ward since then.
He is leading the Cardinal in
scoring at an even 17 points a game.
On Feb. ft against Arizona State, he
broke John Revelli's record of 362
points to become Stanford's all-time
leading freshman scorer. He cur

rently has scored 475 points with
games remaining this weekend
against Washington and Washing
ton State.
Lichti has led Stanford in scoring
in 16 of the 2K games this season,
and he has scored in double figures

The relentlessly slashing offensive moves of swingman Todd Lichti earned the Stanford freshman a spot
on the All Pacific 10 Conference Team announced yesterday. Lichti currently leads the Cardinal in
scoring with 17 points per game. He is the first freshman to he selected to the All Pac-1() squad since
USC's Cliff Robinson in 1978.
in all but one game, including the last
24 straight. He leads Stanford in 12
statistical categories.
If Lichti reaches the 500-point
mark for the season, he will become
only the 10th player in Stanford his
tory to do so.
He has broken Stanford freshman
records for most field goals (174) and
highest scoring average (17.0 so far)
in addition to most points, and he
could break three more this weekend.
"1 knew 1 could make a contribu
tion right away," Lichti said, "but 1
wasn't sure how great of one, what
impact I'd have. 1 knew 1 could come
in and help the team in some way."'
"It's an real honor for a freshman,"
Davis said. "He's the first freshman
in eight years. There are guys who
were first-round picks in the NBA
who didn't make it."
Davis said he hadn't coached a bet
ter freshman in his time at Lafayette,
Boston College or Stanford. "John
Bagley (BC) had outstanding talent
his freshman year, but it took him a
year to put it together."
"It's going to be scary what he'll do
in the future," Fischer said. "He'll
have scored 1,000 points after next
year, and he'll be the all-time scoring
leader as a junior.
"It's amazing what he's able to do.
Today in practice, I threw him a rot
ten pass and said, 'Sorry, Todd.' He
went and caught it and made the
layup. I see it every day in practice."

scoring with 17 points per game. He is the first freshman to he selected to the All Pac-1() squad since
USC's Cliff Robinson in 1978.
in all but one game, including the last
24 straight. He leads Stanford in 12
statistical categories.
If Lichti reaches the 500-point
mark for the season, he will become
only the 10th player in Stanford his
tory to do so.
He has broken Stanford freshman
records for most field goals (174) and
highest scoring average (17.0 so far)
in addition to most points, and he
could break three more this weekend.
"1 knew 1 could make a contribu
tion right away," Lichti said, "but 1
wasn't sure how great of one, what
impact I'd have. 1 knew 1 could come
in and help the team in some way."'
"It's an real honor for a freshman,"
Davis said. "He's the first freshman
in eight years. There are guys who
were first-round picks in the NBA
who didn't make it."
Davis said he hadn't coached a bet
ter freshman in his time at Lafayette,
Boston College or Stanford. "John
Bagley (BC) had outstanding talent
his freshman year, but it took him a
year to put it together."
"It's going to be scary what he'll do
in the future," Fischer said. "He'll
have scored 1,000 points after next
year, and he'll be the all-time scoring
leader as a junior.
"It's amazing what he's able to do.
Today in practice, I threw him a rot
ten pass and said, 'Sorry, Todd.' He
went and caught it and made the
layup. I see it every day in practice."
Among the other awards the Pac
-10 announced this week, Arizona
Coach Lute Olson was named Coach
of the Year.
Stanford freshman Todd Lichti
was one of 10 players named to the
All-Pacific 10 Conference Team for
the 1985-86 season, the conference
office in Walnut Creek announced
yesterday.
Lichti, a 6-foot-4 swingman from
Concord, is the first freshman to
make the all-conference team since
USC's Cliff Robinson did so in
1978. Voting was done by the 10
conference coaches.
"I'm happy to get the award, ob
viously," Lichti said. "I was a little
surprised, but I'm just going to tiy
to take it in stride and not let it af
fect me too much. I thought I had a
chance, but I wasn't sure about the
outcome."
Lichti's selection did come as a
surprise to some because he had
been overlooked for the Pac-10's
Freshman of the Year award, which
was announced last week. UCLA
guard Pooh Richardson and
Arizona forward Sean Elliott tied
for that honor, but neither was
named to the all-league team.
Lichti did join Richardson, Elliott
and USC's Tom Lewis and Bo
Kimble on the conference All-
Freshman Team.
"I was a little surprised, seeing
how the All-Freshman Team voting
went, but it's nice to receive some
thing," Lichti said.
"I was talking to Todd about it,"
coach Tom Davis said, "and what I
think it was is that when the coaches
are voting for the all-conference
team, they look up and down the
league — see who deserves to make
it from Oregon State, who deserves
to make it from UCLA. I think
when they got to Stanford, Todd
Lichti was the name that came up."
"It's great for Todd," senior for
ward Andy Fischer said. "It may be
more important than Freshman of
the Year. He's definitely our most
valuable player."
Nine of the conference's 10
schools were represented on the
team. Washington center Chris
Welp headed the list as the Pac-10
Player of the Year. He and UCLA
forward Reggie Miller were the only
unanimous selections.
Rounding out the squad are USC
forward Derrick Dowell. Washing
ton forward Paul Fortier. Oregon
State center Jose Ortiz, California
guard Kevin Johnson. Washington
State guard Keith Morrison.
Arizona guard Steve Kerr and
Oregon forward Jerry Adams. No
Arizona State player made the
team.
Lichti came in this year as the
most highly touted of five freshmen
that Davis signed last vear, but

opened the season on the heneh at
small forward behind Fischer. By
the Cardinal's sixth game at Har
vard in mid-December, he was in
the starting lineup for good.
When guard Novian Whitsitt.
who had replaced Steve Brown in
the lineup, missed four games with a
pulled back muscle. Lichti moved

over to the guard position. He has
split time between guard and for
ward since then.
He is leading the Cardinal in
scoring at an even 17 points a game.
On Feb. ft against Arizona State, he
broke John Revelli's record of 362
points to become Stanford's all-time
leading freshman scorer. He cur

rently has scored 475 points with
games remaining this weekend
against Washington and Washing
ton State.
Lichti has led Stanford in scoring
in 16 of the 2K games this season,
and he has scored in double figures
