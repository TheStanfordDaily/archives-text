# Women netters meet No. 7 Cal
## Fendick getting revved-up after early-season misfiring 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
Like a finely-tuned sportscar, Patty Fendick
seems to be clicking on all cylinders after some
early sputtering and backfiring, and she will lead
the racing 6-0 Stanford tennis team into a 1:30
p.m. Varsity Courts matchup against seventh
ranked California today.
The junior entered the season ranked No. 4 in
the nation individually, but struggled on a trip to
Arizona where she lost her matches against both
Arizona and Arizona State. The team as a whole
also struggled, but managed to eke out a 6-3 vic
tory over the Sun Devils and then edge the
Wildcats 5-4.
"I think it was just high anxiety those first two
matches," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said of
his No. 1 singles player, who also teams with
Leigh Anne Eldredge in the first doubles slot.
Last week, though, Fendick gave evidence that
she was starting to find her groove as she
destroyed Monique Javer of San Diego State 6-
1, 6-2 and UCLA's Jane Thomas 6-3, 6-4. The
rest of the Cardinal seemed to take a cue from
Fendick as it dropped a highly regarded and 10th
ranked Aztec team 6-3 and No. 9 UCLA 8-1.
"She came back strong," Brennan said. "I still
think she's the best player in college tennis."
"It takes a while to get going," said Fendick,

whose season record recently edged over the
.500 mark at 3-2. "I'm just playing mediocre.
I've got a long way to go."
Golden Bear Karen Shin will get an opportu
nity to slow down the surging Fendick in No. 1
singles. Heather Ettus usually leads off the Cal
ladder, but is out of singles action and doubtful
for doubles due to tendonitis of the wrist. Fresh
man Shin has ably filled Ettus' shoes, though, and
is ranked eighth in the country individually.
Other top matchups find Stanford freshman
Eleni Rossides taking on 17th-ranked Jennifer
Prah at No. 2 and another Cardinal freshman,
Marianne Werdel, against Linda Oechsle in the
third spot.
Eldredge, who is undefeated in singles, will
face Cal's Alissa Feinerman at No. 4. Stephanie
Savides and Kay Tittle have a combined 10-2
record for the Cardinal and will take on Sharon
Fletcher and Collette Kavanaugh in fifth and
sixth singles, respectively.
After a recent shakeup, the Bears' doubles
pairings are still unknown.
"We'll get the first look at their new doubles
teams tomorrow," Brennan said.
Stanford's doubles teams have proved to be
unstoppable lately after sweeping all six matches
against UCLA and SDSU.
Leading off will be Eldredge and Fendick, who
have a 4-1 season record.

"They sort of work their way into a match,"
Brennan said of his top doubles team. "They
work well together. I think they can be NCAA
champs."
Savides and Cari Hagey comprise the No. 2
pair and Tittle and Werdel round out the doubles
lineup.
Despite the fact that Stanford has never lost to
Cal in Brennan's seven-year tenure, the Bears
still look to offer a good match. Last year the
Cardinal edged out a narrow 5-4 verdict in
Berkeley, and Cal finished fourth in the NCAAs
â€” ahead of Stanford.
"They're just a real good team," Brennan said.
"They've got very consistent players, players that
make you work all the time.''
"I think playing Cal is more of a pleasure than
playing any other team," Fendick said. "We all
have friends on the team. Against Cal the sports
manship is usually high and that's what makes it
more enjoyable."
For its part, Stanford seems to be coming into
its own as it faces a top 10 opponent for the third
meet in a row.
"1 think we're a lot more serious about things
this year," Fendick said. "I think we're confident.
We're not cocky. The confidence is coming from
the fact that everybody's been working very
hard."
