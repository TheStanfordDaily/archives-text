# Kennedy speaks to ASSU Senate

### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Saying the ASSU Senate "has no case for a
police review commission," University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy told senators last night
the proposed commission is unnecessary since
he is "fully committed to hearing complaints
about the police."
During an open forum at last night's meeting,
Kennedy discussed the commission as well as
the "general feelings" students have for the
ASSU Senate, the ASSU's efforts to reform the
constitution and Stanford's sanctuary move
ment.
Kennedy said the "incidents associated with
the arrest" of senior Robby Perkins at the Oct.
11 sit-in at Old Union involving Stanford police
and Santa Clara County Sheriff s officers "don't
provide a basis" for the formation of the com
mission.
As an alternative to the proposed ASSU
Police Review Commission, Kennedy said he
would seek "harmony between the police and
community segments" through an "advisory
committee under the direction of the dean of
Student Affairs."
Kennedy stated there is a need for a
"consulting process," rather than a "form for
trying officers."
Disputing Kennedy's comparison of the pro

posed commission with "acourt system," Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) member Tim Quirk said
the senate is "asking for a form where we can
hear facts about complaints" involving the
police.
"If students complain, we should take care of
it as it is happening," rather than wait for the
issue to go through the courts, he said.
Graduate Senator Jim DeLaHunt criticized
Kennedy's proposal that a police advisory com
mittee be placed under the jurisdiction of the
dean of Student Affairs. While any commission
under the dean of Student Affair's jurisdiction
would be "primarily for the students,"
DeLaHunt noted that "workers also have ques
tions about police actions."
Addressing the question of how he perceives
the student government to be working, Ken
nedy told the senate that students he has spoken
with have indicated a "lack of sense of partici
pation and representation" in student govern
ment. Emphasizing that "there is little basis for
voters to know the views of senate candidates,"
he said election procedures need to be im
proved to better students' knowledge of the
candidates' stances on issues.
Offering possible solutions to the rift he sees
between students and the ASSU, Kennedy
called efforts at constitutional reform "a very

healthy impulse."
"It's more like making love than brushing
your teeth," he said, encouraging senators to
continue the effort to "make it work."
When asked for his opinion concerning the
senate's endorsement of Stanford as a sanctuary
for Central American refugees, Kennedy said,
"If one is asked one's views concerning an il
legal activity one has to say it is more tactful not
to ask."
In other business, the senate passed a resolu

tion supporting the Innovative Academic
Courses (I AC) and SWOPSI, the current or
ganization which would be altered by Univer
sity efforts to reorganize the programs. The
resolution condemns the "precipitous action of
the University with respect to reorganizing the
I AC," which "represents an attack on the
already minimal student input into course de
velopment at Stanford."
Another resolution passed by the senate 15-3
endorses the National March for Women's
Lives, which is to take place in Washington,
D.C., March 9 and in Los Angeles March 16.
The march will seek "to keep abortion and birth
control safe and legal."
