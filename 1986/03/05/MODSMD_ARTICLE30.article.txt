# CIVA rivals clash
## Spikers travel to Hawaii for two crucial matches 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Six days in the Hawaiian sun
doesn't sound too rough, but the
Stanford men's volleyball team didn't
travel to Honolulu for a vacation. The
fourth-ranked Cardinal faces one of
its most difficult tests of the year
tonight and Friday night against the
University of Hawaii, eighth in the
country, and third in the California
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion (CIV A).
Stanford, coming off a heartbreak
ing five-game loss at home to UCLA
last Wednesday, is 7-4 overall and 5-
4 in CIV A play, good for fifth place
in the league. Hawaii is 5-2 in the
conference, losing only to UC-Santa
Barbara and USC. The Cardinal beat
Hawaii's Rainbows twice last year at
home.
Hawaii has a new look this year
with first-year Coach Alan Rosehill
and Asst. Coach Tony Crabb, who
worked with the 1984 U.S. Olympic
gold medal team. The squad is young,
with a number of redshirt and true
freshmen; however, the team's good
record and hitting percentage of .438
does not reflect any inexperience.
In fact, the top three hitters for
Hawaii are all seniors. Jeff Rodgers
and Bill Via are tied for the team lead

in hitting percentage at .401; Rodgers
has 103 kills while Via totals 80. The
team's leader in kills is Pono Maa,
with 112 to go along with a .375
average.
Freshman Allen "Repeat" Allen
has recorded 86 kills on the year and
led the team in that category for the
early part of the year until he suffered
a dislocated shoulder in Southern
California. He is reportedly close to
full recovery and will be in action
against Stanford.

"Hawaii is a real young team,"
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw
said," but from every report, they are
excellent. They're playing really
well."
Senior outside hitter Chris Braun
leads the Cardinal in kills by a wide
margin following his amazing 49-kill
performance last week against

UCLA. In that match, Braun made
only four hitting errors in 86 attacks
and had a .523 percentage. The All-
American candidate now has 187
kills this season, and his .345 average
is second only to junior Steve Blue's
.353. The team is hitting .296 as a
whole.
Second on the squad in kills is
sophomore Scott Fortune with 126.
Fortune was troubled with illness
during the UCLA match but is
healthy for Hawaii. Blue has a total of
77 kills, and senior Jon Root has 74
despite missing four matches with an
ankle injury. The AU-American
outside hitter returned to the lineup
against the Bruins and came up with
28 kills and a .371 average. Senior
Dan Parr made his 1986 debut in that
match and recorded 11 kills.
"Stanford is physically in pretty
good shape," Shaw said. "We're
hoping we can do well. It's not easy to
play in Hawaii and these are critical
games. Playing at Hawaii is always
tough; there are distractions and a
different climate. It will be a real
test."
Stanford returns to face No. 7 Long
Beach State a week from tomorrow.
The Cardinal is hoping to avenge a
five-game loss (in which Root was
injured) suffered earlier this season.
