Philippine appellate judges resign
MANILA, Philippines — The 38 judges of the Philippine Court of
Appeals, the nation's second-highest court, reportedly agreed yesterday
to resign in order to give President Corazon Aquino a free hand in
shaping the judiciary, which has played a pivotal role in political life
here.
Justice Minister Neptali Gonzales announced that the intermediate
court had indicated to Aquino its readiness for a mass resignation. Offi
cials at Aquino headquarters later said 30 of the judges had for
mally resigned and that the other eight had agreed to do so.
The Aquino forces hope that they will be given similar leeway to fill all
the seats on the 15-member Supreme Court.
Last week, Aquino called upon the entire Supreme Court to step
down, but so far, many of the 11 sitting justices (there have been four
vacancies) are holding on to their posts, pointing to guarantees of tenure
under the Philippine constitution.
All the members of both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals
were appointed by Aquino's predecessor, former President Ferdinand
Marcos, during his two decades of rule here. Five of the current Supreme
Court justices were classmates of Marcos at the University of the
Philippines School of Law in the 19305.
Reagan pushes for Saudi arms sale
WASHINGTON — President Reagan will ask Congress to approve a
highly controversial $300 million arms sale to Saudi Arabia, Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard Lugar, (R-Ind), dis
closed yesterday.
Lugar, who announced the president's plans at a meeting of Senate
Republicans, said it will be a scaled-down version of the $1.2 billion
package that the Administration abandoned earlier this year in the face
of strong opposition from supporters of Israel.
Sources said the package, scheduled to be submitted to Congress
next Tuesday, will include the sale of Sidewinder air-to-air and Stinger
surface-to-air missiles, two American-made weapons that the Saudis
have received previously.
Eliminated from the original package, according to sources, were re
quests for Black Hawk helicopters and advanced electronic equipment
that the Saudis have been seeking for their F-15 and F-5 aircraft.
In briefing Republicans on the proposal, Lugar asked them to with
hold judgment until it actually reaches the Congress. But he declined to
predict how the Congress will vote.
Assassination mars Israel's plans
JERUSALEM — An effort by Israel to enhance self-rule among
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank by appointing moderate Arab
mayors appeared near collapse yesterday as several nominees withdrew
their candidacies in the wake of the assassination Sunday of Nablus
Mayor Zafri Masri.
Jamil Tarifi, 38, a lawyer from Biera, notified the Israeli occupation
government that he was withdrawing his name as a candidate less than
24 hours after Masri, a symbol of Israeli attempts at "devolution" of Pal
estinian self-rule in the West Bank, was shot to death by an unidentified
gunman in front of his office.
Similarly, Nadim Zaro, a former minister in the Jordanian govern
ment, who had been expected to apply to the Israeli authorities for the
mayoral appointment in Ramallah, published an advertisement in an
East Jerusalem Arabic newspaper denying ever having sought public of
fice, and then went to Amman, the Jordanian capital.
Palestinian sources said other prospective political appointees were
expressing doubts about accepting public office in the aftermath of the
assassination by Masri.
U.S., Soviets conclude arms talks
BONN, West Germany — The United States and the Soviet Union
yesterday concluded a seven-week round of talks in Geneva on limiting
nuclear and space weapons that produced the first signs of tangible prog
ress toward an interim accord since the negotiations opened a year ago.
The two sides exchanged new proposals that showed some conver
gence toward reductions in medium-range missiles based in Europe. But
there was no substantive change in positions in the other two forums on
intercontinental nuclear missiles and space-based defensive systems, ac
cording to U.S. negotiators and allied officials informed about the talks.
"Our verdict is a mixed one," U.S. delegation head Max Kampelman
said in an assessment issued after the final session. He said that while
both sides moved closer toward such common aims as a separate accord
on intermediate-range missiles, adequate verification measures and the
ultimate goal of banishing all nuclear weapons, there was "less accom
plished than we had hoped."
Viktor Karpov, the chief Soviet negotiator, blamed the Americans for
the failure to achieve more headway. "We introduced a lot of proposals
here," he told reporters. "We hope maybe next time there will be more
progress than this time."
The Soviet and U.S. delegations are expected to return to their capi
tals for a two-month recess before resuming negotiations on May 8.
Senior American delegates perceived some cause for optimism in that
for the first time in the year-old talks, Soviet negotiators formally con
firmed a desire to reach a separate accord eliminating U.S. and Soviet
intermediate missiles from the European zone that would not be tied to
parallel agreement in the other two areas.
Gorbachev blocks irrigation project
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union, apparently reflecting the wishes of
its new leader Mikhail Gorbachev, has dropped a plan for diverting
water from rivers flowing north to aid the arid south, a senior official
said yesterday.
His statement pointed to victory for Soviet writers, concerned with the
environment, who have mounted an extraordinay campaign against the
rivers project in the state-run media.
On the other hand, political leaders in southern republics, such as Uz
bekistan and Kazakhstan, apparently lost a major political battle if the
northern rivers project is permanently shelved.
The monumental irrigation project, favored by the late Leonid
Brezhnev and endorsed by former Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko,
was included in proposed guidelines for adoption by the 27th Commu
nist Party congress.
Sponsors of the river-reversal scheme said it would provide enough
water to assure bountiful cotton and grain crops in the southern
republics, where the land is fertile but lacks water.
But critics argued that diversion of water from rivers flowing into the
Arctic Ocean might change weather patterns not only in the Soviet Un
ion but around the world as well.
Iranian plane bombs French tanker
TEHRAN, Iran — The French supertanker Chaumont was rocketed
by an Iranian helicopter northeast of Qatar yesterday as it was sailing to
the Saudi oil export terminal of Ras Tanura, shipping sources said.
The engine room of the 270,000-ton vessel was damaged but there
were no casualties. The tanker, on its way to pick up Saudi Arabian
crude oil, reversed course and headed to the southern gulf port of Dubai
for repairs.
The Chaumont was the third tanker to be hit by Iran on the Ras
Tanura route in less than 24 hours.
The successive raids on the Saudi tanker route came to the backdrop
of Iranian threats to the non-combatant gulf countries, who are accused
of aiding Iraq in the war against Iran and of colluding in a conspiracy to
lower oil prices on the international market.
