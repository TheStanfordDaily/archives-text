# Official says aid lacks control
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — State Depart
ment audit controls over millions of
dollars in U.S. humanitarian aid to
Nicaraguan rebels "cannot verify ac
tual delivery or receipt of items" in
the field, a General Accounting Of
fice official said in congressional tes
timony prepared for delivery today.
The statement by Frank Conahan,
director of GAO's national security
and international affairs division, said
the department "does not have pro
cedures and controls which would al
low it to provide these assurances"
that Congress asked for when it ap
proved the $27 million aid program
last fall.
The report for the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Western
Hemisphere affairs should provide
ammunition in the debate over Presi
dent Reagan's new request for $100
million in aid to the Contras, including
perhaps $70 million in covert military
aid.
White House communications
director Patrick Buchanan launched
the opening salvo by warning on
"CBS Morning News":
"If we don't get that assistance to
the Contras, they'll be defeated," he
said. "The communists . . . will roll up
Nicaragua and then we'll be left with
two options: basically the United
States can then step aside and watch

the Warsaw Pact roll up Central
America, or we send in the Marines."
Secretary of State George Shultz
expressed general agreement. "If it's
a question of avoiding the use of U.S.
military forces directly, then support
for the president's package is indi

cated," he told a House subcommit
tee.
On the other side of the issue, 167
religious leaders charged that
"exaggeration, misinformation and
outright falsehood form the heart of
the Reagan administration case

against Nicaragua." And the
Washington-based human rights
group Americas Watch, reporting
abuses by the Nicaraguan govern
ment as well as the Contra rebels,
urged that the aid package be
defeated.
Paradoxically, the critical GAO
report may provide ammunition for
the Administration, which has been
arguing that the overt program is
working so badly that only a new
covert plan can meet the Contras'
needs.
While the $5.2 million in aid funds
so far spent in the United States has
been under "considerable control,"
$7.1 million spent in the Central
American region is not, Conahan
said. "Payment is usually made to a
Miami bank acount of one of several
brokers . . . there is no audit trail
showing payments from the brokers'
accounts to suppliers, and only partial
documentation of shipments from the
suppliers to the resistance forces."
Congressional sources said the
GAO had told them about $4 million
worth of equipment purchased in the
United States remains in U.S.
warehouses because of refusal by the
Honduran government to allow its
delivery to Contra troops based in
that country.
