# Botha to lift emergency state
## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — In a
surprise double announcement yesterday, Presi
dent Pieter Botha said his government would lift
South Africa's 7-month-old state of emergency
soon, probably Friday, and is ready to start imple
menting a U.N.-endorsed formula for Namibian in
dependence on Aug. 1.
Botha indicated, however, that South Africa's
already comprehensive security laws would be
strengthened further to enable police to contain
continuing racial unrest and that the Namibian
commitment remains conditional on reaching
agreement on the withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola.
One immediate effect of the lifting of the emer
gency will be to end restrictions on media coverage
of unrest in the designated emergency areas.
The restrictions on media coverage, which came
into force Nov. 2, severely curtailed television
coverage of the unrest in particular. They banned
all camera and radio crews from the emergency
areas and required print reporters to get special
permission to enter such an area.
The permission was seldom granted and numbers

of reporters were arrested for trying to get within
sight of the unrest.
South Africa, which has controlled the former
German colony of Namibia since World War I,
agreed eight years ago to a procedure for granting
the territory its independence that was set out in
Security Council Resolution 435.
The issue became complicated when Angola,
which gives sanctuary to guerrillas of the South
West Africa People's Organization, the Namibian
liberation movement, sought Cuban troop protec
tion from South African incursions and the ravages
of Jonas Savimbi's pro-Western rebels. Pretoria,
with the backing of the Reagan administration,
began insisting that the Cubans would have to leave
before Namibia could become independent.
By 1983 South Africa was stating that this con
troversial "linkage" was all that stood in the way of
implementing Resolution 435.
U.S. officials have continued negotiating on the
issue, and at a meeting with South Africa on the
Cape Verde Islands in October 1984 Angola
agreed in principle to reduce the number of Cubans
— estimated to number 25,000 to 30,000 — over
three years.

South Africa is believed to have insisted on a
faster withdrawal, to ensure that there are no
Cubans left in Angola after its own troops have
been phased out of Namibia under terms of
Resolution 435.
"Despite progress which has been made in
bilateral discussions since October 1984 ... the
Angolan government has yet to agree to a satisfac
tory timetable for Cuban withdrawal," Botha said
in his statement yesterday.
Some observers see Botha's statement as part of
a carrot-and-stick operation by the United States
and South Africa, aimed at persuading Luanda to
accept a package that includes inviting Savimbi to
join a "government of national unity," getting rid
of the Cubans who are ostensibly there to protect it
from Savimbi, and allowing Namibia to become in
dependent.
According to this analysis, the stick comes in the
Reagan Administration's decision last month to
give military aid to Savimbi's National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, and the carrot
now in Botha's offer of a quick independence for
Namibia if Angola will come up with an acceptable
timetable for Cuban withdrawal.
