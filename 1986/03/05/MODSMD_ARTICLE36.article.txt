'Star Wars' is vulnerable
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union could
complicate a U.S. missile defense with so many
thousands of decoy warheads that Strategic
Defense Initiative officials are now seeking a new
type of exotic and expensive technology to distin
guish decoys from actual warheads, the chief of
the Pentagons "Star Wars" program said yester
day.
Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, the SDI chief,
told a congressional subcommittee yesterday that
"we have now come to the conclusion" that
traditional surveillance satellites will not be able
to detect the warheads as they travel through
space amid decoys, balloons, chaff and other
matter — "a threat cloud," Abrahamson said,
"of frightening proportions."
As a result, he said, the SDI may have to
deploy space-based neutral particle beams that
could "irradiate" the threat cloud and ground
based lasers that could nudge and jostle the
decoys, so other weapons could distinguish and
dest.oy the real warheads.
Abrahamson appeared before a House Armed
Services subcommittee to defend President
Reagan's $5.4 billion fiscal 1987 budget request
for SDI. Last year, Congress gave the Defense
and Energy departments $3 billion for the pro
gram.

Failure likelihood high
WASHINGTON — Weeks before the dis
astrous launch of the space shuttle Challenger, a
panel of federal safety experts had concluded
that the craft's solid rocket boosters were roughly
100 times as likely to fail as NASA engineers
claimed, two House subcommittees were told
yesterday.
The Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Panel,
a federal board that estimates the hazards of
space missions carrying radioactive payloads,
pegged the likelihood of a booster failure at 1 in
1,000, rather than the 1 in 100,000 figure used
by NASA officials as the minimum level for safe
space flight.
The panel's three co-chairmen testified that
they raised the differing estimates with the
NASA but were unable to "stretch" their analy
sis to match the space agency's lower risk levels.
Tax freeze proposed
WASHINGTON — House Republicans Bill
Frenzel (Minn.), John Porter (111.) and Hank
Brown (Colo.) introduced a budget plan that
would meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target
without a tax increase by freezing defense and
domestic outlays, including Social Security

benefits.
Budget Committee members expressed confi
dence that they would ultimately produce a
spending plan that would reduce the deficit
enough to avoid triggering the far-reaching and
painful automatic cuts required by the Gramm-
Rudman balanced-budget law.
The automatic reductions will occur unless
Congress can ultimately produce a budget that
reduces the deficit to within $10 billion of the
law's $144 billion target. "It's truth or conse
quences in budgeting," said Sen. Ernest Hollings,
(D-S.C.) a committee member.
However, despite the potential consequences,
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,
(R-N.M.) conceded that no strategy was emerg
ing for reaching that goal. "There has been no
consensus," he said. "It will be very difficult, in
my opinion."
Stocks close mixed
NEW Y ORK — A late wave of selling dragged
down the blue chips, leaving the stock market
with a mixed showing in heavy trading yesterday
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
nearly 14 points going into the final hour of
trading, closed at 1,686.42, down 10.25 from
Monday.
