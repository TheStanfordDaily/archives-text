Ramirez trial continues
LOS ANGELES — Defense attorneys for
Night Stalker suspect Richard Ramirez are
claiming that some evidence, including two pis
tols and an automobile, should be ruled inadmis
sible in court because they were seized by police
in violation of Ramirez's constitutional rights.
In defense motions made public yesterday, the
attorneys assert that on the day of their client's
arrest, police continued to question Ramirez
after he "said that he would like to talk to a
lawyer and that he did not have a lawyer and
could not afford one."
During the interview, the defense contended,
police told Ramirez that his statements could not
be used "against him," because he had asked for
a lawyer. Moreover, the defense charged, police

said "it would haunt' his mother 'to her grave' if
defendant didn't tell the police everything.''
Los Angeles Municipal Judge James Nelson
announced yesterday that he would not rule on
the defense motion until any evidence seized as a
result of Ramirez' statements is about to be in
troduced at the preliminary hearing.
Nelson had listened to a copy of the tape
recording of the police interview inclosed session
Monday.
The prosecutor. Deputy District Attorney P.
Philip Halpin, declined to comment on the
defense motion yesterday, saying, "I need not
react to any of that, nor would I be interested."
