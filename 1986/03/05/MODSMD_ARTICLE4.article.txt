Representatives of campus minority and progressive
groups last night united for the first time to ratify unani
mously a "People's Platform" for the upcoming Council
of Presidents (COP) elections.
Students voted on the platform during a-xonvention
held at El Centro Chicano by the Third World and Pro
gressive Student Alliance, an unofficial group that
emerged from two campus meetings last month.
"We, a coalition of Third World students and members
of the progressive community at Stanford, submit the fol
lowing document to the greater University community in
response to a general atmosphere of disrespect for our in
terests," the preamble to the platform states.
"We decided that we'd join forces," according to alli
ance member Felix Cuevas. "The students decided that
they needed a COP platform to cover the issues we want
covered â€” and they are everything you can imagine."
The platform outlines the alliance's interests, whether
or not a COP slate is formed from members of the alii

ance, Cuevas said.
No new COP slate was formed last night at the conven
tion. The alliance's guidelines for electing a slate include a
rule that there must be at least two women and two Third
World students among the four contenders.
"The platform is an extremely important document be
cause any senator can endorse or not support any part of
it," said ASSU Elections Commissioner Robin Miller.-
ASSU Senate Chair Carey White and Undergraduate
Senator Mary Thurber were also present at the meeting to
announce their COP slate with Kim Crawford and Rudy
Fuentes. Their platform is called "The Real Solution."
White said that in the spring he could state their posi
tion on "The People's Platform," and then the members
of the alliance could choose whether or not to endorse
them. Students campaigning for the COP or senate are
not allowed to express their political views until the week
preceding the April elections, according to Miller.
Eight undergraduates and one graduate student also
announced their candidacy for the senate at the meeting.
