### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
Representatives of campus minority and progressive
groups last night united for the first time to ratify unani
mously a "People's Platform" for the upcoming Council
of Presidents (COP) elections.
Students voted on the platform during a-xonvention
held at El Centro Chicano by the Third World and Pro
gressive Student Alliance, an unofficial group that
emerged from two campus meetings last month.
"We, a coalition of Third World students and members
of the progressive community at Stanford, submit the fol
lowing document to the greater University community in
response to a general atmosphere of disrespect for our in
terests," the preamble to the platform states.
"We decided that we'd join forces," according to alli
ance member Felix Cuevas. "The students decided that
they needed a COP platform to cover the issues we want
covered â€” and they are everything you can imagine."
The platform outlines the alliance's interests, whether
or not a COP slate is formed from members of the alii

ance, Cuevas said.
No new COP slate was formed last night at the conven
tion. The alliance's guidelines for electing a slate include a
rule that there must be at least two women and two Third
World students among the four contenders.
"The platform is an extremely important document be
cause any senator can endorse or not support any part of
it," said ASSU Elections Commissioner Robin Miller.-
ASSU Senate Chair Carey White and Undergraduate
Senator Mary Thurber were also present at the meeting to
announce their COP slate with Kim Crawford and Rudy
Fuentes. Their platform is called "The Real Solution."
White said that in the spring he could state their posi
tion on "The People's Platform," and then the members
of the alliance could choose whether or not to endorse
them. Students campaigning for the COP or senate are
not allowed to express their political views until the week
preceding the April elections, according to Miller.
Eight undergraduates and one graduate student also
announced their candidacy for the senate at the meeting.
During the convention, students evaluated edu
cation at Stanford. The Western Culture program
was among the issues discussed. The platform says
the program is "severely deficient and must be fun
damentally restructured to include the vital contri
butions of women, blacks, Latinos, Asians and
native Americans/American Indians."
I he platform also calls for changes in community
relations. In a section entitled "Police Harass
ment, it states that "Third World students are par
ticularly targeted by police aggression in various
forms" and calls for a smaller security force and
better public relations.
The platform also attacks ASSU funding proce

dures. "Because of the limited number of Third
World and progressive students on our campus,
their programs and organizations are subject to
harsh and unfair dealings with ASSU funding. . . .
The Program Board should not be the confronta
tional, hostile system that it is now. It should be
open to more students."
The University's attitude toward theme houses is
also criticized in the platform.
"Although Residential Education states that [it
is| committed to cross-cultural education, this de
partment is slow to come to the defense of Ujamaa,
Zapata and Okada. Res Ed must demonstrate its
commitment by recognizing and supporting the
role that theme house staff play in helping students
to deal more effectively with issues pertaining to
and affecting them."
Under the section entitled "Affirmative Action,"

the platform says, "Not only should the University
hire and tenure more Third World faculty mem
bers, it should also hire an ethnically diverse staff.
This staff . . . should be instated in policy-making
positions which will. . . affect all sectors of the Uni
versity."
At the first meeting that led to the creation of the
platform, "Minorities got together to unite for bet
ter representation in the ASSU," Cuevas said.
The groups represented at the convention last
night included Asian American Students Associa
tion, MEChA (the Chicano Student Movement),
Stanford American Indian Organization, Stanford
Out of South Africa, the Black Student Union, Hil
lel, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford,
Stanford Humanist Organization, Stanford Central
America Action Network, Students Against
Reaganism and the Third World Women's Caucus.
