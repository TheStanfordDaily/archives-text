# The 						blind date, the Stanford way

### SMITA SINGH 
Ringggg! Ringggg!
"Hello?"
"Hi, you don't know me, but
I'm in your econ class. Anyway,
I'm calling because our dorm is
having a screw-your-roommate
party and I'm supposed to find a

Feature

secret date for one of my
dormmates. I saw you in econ sec
tion, and I thought you'd be per
fect for this friend of mine. ..."
And they lived happily ever
after. Or so the story goes.
Is it a secret alumni plot to erad
icate celibacy on the Stanford
campus? No, just the usual

onslaught of "blind date" style
parties: screw-your-roommate
parties, crush parties, computer
match-up parties and date-for-a
dance parties. They come in all
shapes and sizes; the formats and
themes vary, but the gist remains
the same: meeting Mr. or Ms.
Right.
By far the most common type of
parties are the screw-your
roommate parties or variations
thereof. From getting a date for
one's roommate to dealing with
one's own date, almost eveiy Stan
ford student has memories of such
a party.
Generally, one's first experience
with a screw-your-roommate oc
curs during the freshman year. Most
freshman dorms have screw-your
roommate parties to provide the
freshmen with yet another opportu
nity to meet new people.
"Not my freshman dorm," com
plained junior Cyndy Yu, a resident
assistant (RA) in Alondra. "I've been
waiting for two years for a screw
your-roommate party and now I
don't even have a roommate."
Yu may have lucked out. Finding a
date for one's roommate or
dormmate can be quite an ordeal.
The day of my dorm's variation on
screw-your-roommate the following
note was scrawled on a piece of paper
taped to my door: "Smita, were you
able to get a hold of that chick? If not,
could you do me a huge favor? Just
ask anybody today at lunch — I'm not
gonna be around until dinner. Thanks
a ton. (I'll do you a favor sometime.)"
The desperation was apparent.
Often, a request for a specific date
will eliminate the problem of having
to set someone up. Sometimes it will
only exacerbate it. What do you tell
your roommate when the requested
party refuses the invitation? Be crea
tive — yes, it is theoretically possible
that every Dollie has to rearrange her
sock drawer on Saturday night.
Now, for the date itself.

"I had an outstanding time," said
freshman Ross Peabody about his
dorm's screw party.
Even potential disaster situations
have a way of working themselves
out. Freshman Melissa Pashigian
recounted the dinner she and a
couple of friends threw together for
their blind dates.
"It was 6:30 and our dates were ar
riving at 7:30, and we still didn't have
any dinner plans .... It was
impossible to find a car. Then some
one came up with the brilliant idea to
order take-out Chinese food. As it
started getting closer and closer to
delivery time, I knew they wouldn't
bring chopsticks — everyone else
thought they would — I was right.
"We also forgot about plates, so we
ended up having to scrounge around
the dorm for plates, bowls, anything.
We had to do the dishes before the
dinner. Anyway, we ended up eating
with plastic spoons on any sort of
plate. Our dates were really cool
about the whole affair, though," Pa
shigian said.
Unlike screw-your-roommate style
parties that pair each person with one
date, crush parties allow one to invite
a whole slew of likelies. Each resident
of the dorm throwing the crush party
invites a number of people on whom
he or she has a crush. Often invita
tions are given anonymously, thereby
enticing those invited to go and at
least find out who found them so ap
pealing.

However, freshman Chris Barlow,
who attended a crush party at
Ujaama, said, "A lot of people that
got invited didn't go."
Freshman Jason Greenman, an
other crush party attendee, seemed
dubious about the effectiveness of the
parties. "The problem with crush par
ties is that the people who are
crushed upon end up meeting each
other instead of those who invited
them," he said.
Perhaps Greenman would have
preferred the computer dating party

arranged by Cardenal for Alondra,
Faisan and Cardenal. The computer
match-up method is probably the
most effective and least time coasum
ing in terms of simply getting every
one a date. Anyone who fills out a
questionnaire receives a date —
maybe not one's dream date, but a
date nonetheless.
The computer matched people on
the basis of their compatability as de
termined by a questionnaire. Partici
pants answered questions ranging
from the mundane, " Do you prefer a

date who has: facial hair or no facial
hair?" to the racy, "How tar would
you go in public?"
The possible answers for the latter
question were: 1. A glance from
across the parking lot 2. A big grin
and a not-so-casual hello 3. Holding
hands in the dorm 4. A peck in the
doorway 5. Extensive groveling 6.
Disobeying hand-check call 7. Sex on
Flo Mo Field 8. Intense, overt, pas
sionate sex at house meeting.
The night of the party, each person
was handed a computer print-out
biography of their date and was intro
duced to them.
"It was like a slave auction," said
freshman Jennifer Boyd, recalling the
fact that the females had to stand in
dividually on a raised platform in
front of the group to allow their dates
to come up and "claim" them.
Commenting on her experience
with such parties, freshman Robin
Van Es said, "No matter how much
you have in common with somebody,
there's an inexplicable chemistry that
tells whether you'll hit it off or not.
Unfortunately. ..."
"Of course, they don't work out,"
Julie Berry said. "Since you know
from the beginning you're expected
to — you know. I guess it would be
hilarious if it really did work out, it'd
be something you tell your kids
about."
Perhaps the most unique blind date
party was that set up by the RAs of
Gavilan, Alondra and Larkin. The

theme of the party was date-for-a
dance (more if you like'em, ditch'em
if you don't)."
The questionnaire distributed to
participants reflected the relaxed ap
proach, asking questions such as
"What's your favorite cereal?" At the
party a list of pairings was posted up
for those interested in contacting
their "perfect match."
"Lots of people didn't even find
their dates. Some people looked half
heartedly. But the party was really
good," freshman Vivien Houng said.
Admittedly, these parties do not al
ways function as a way to meet new
people. What ever happened to Mr.
or Ms. Right in this mess? Wasn't
meeting them the whole point? Well,
meet freshman Gwen Loosmore and
sophomore Herb Chen. Loosmore
and Chen went on their first date
through the Car
denal/Faisan/Alondra Computer
Dating party — and they are still
dating.
A success story for blind date par
ties? Actually, Loosmore and Chen's
encounter was a little short of ran
dom. As one of the organizers of the
computer dating party, Chen did a bit
of maneuvering to get set up with
Loosmore.
"I'm glad I did it," Chen said. "I've
taken a lot of crap from the guys
about rigging the thing. But it was
worth it."
How sweet. Maybe, Prince Charm
ings do exist.

I'm in your econ class. Anyway,
I'm calling because our dorm is
having a screw-your-roommate
party and I'm supposed to find a

Feature

secret date for one of my
dormmates. I saw you in econ sec
tion, and I thought you'd be per
fect for this friend of mine. ..."
And they lived happily ever
after. Or so the story goes.
Is it a secret alumni plot to erad
icate celibacy on the Stanford
campus? No, just the usual

onslaught of "blind date" style
parties: screw-your-roommate
parties, crush parties, computer
match-up parties and date-for-a
dance parties. They come in all
shapes and sizes; the formats and
themes vary, but the gist remains
the same: meeting Mr. or Ms.
Right.
By far the most common type of
parties are the screw-your
roommate parties or variations
thereof. From getting a date for
one's roommate to dealing with
one's own date, almost eveiy Stan
ford student has memories of such
a party.
Generally, one's first experience
with a screw-your-roommate oc
curs during the freshman year. Most
freshman dorms have screw-your
roommate parties to provide the
freshmen with yet another opportu
nity to meet new people.
"Not my freshman dorm," com
plained junior Cyndy Yu, a resident
assistant (RA) in Alondra. "I've been
waiting for two years for a screw
your-roommate party and now I
don't even have a roommate."
Yu may have lucked out. Finding a
date for one's roommate or
dormmate can be quite an ordeal.
The day of my dorm's variation on
screw-your-roommate the following
note was scrawled on a piece of paper
taped to my door: "Smita, were you
able to get a hold of that chick? If not,
could you do me a huge favor? Just
ask anybody today at lunch — I'm not
gonna be around until dinner. Thanks
a ton. (I'll do you a favor sometime.)"
The desperation was apparent.
Often, a request for a specific date
will eliminate the problem of having
to set someone up. Sometimes it will
only exacerbate it. What do you tell
your roommate when the requested
party refuses the invitation? Be crea
tive — yes, it is theoretically possible
that every Dollie has to rearrange her
sock drawer on Saturday night.
Now, for the date itself.

"I had an outstanding time," said
freshman Ross Peabody about his
dorm's screw party.
Even potential disaster situations
have a way of working themselves
out. Freshman Melissa Pashigian
recounted the dinner she and a
couple of friends threw together for
their blind dates.
"It was 6:30 and our dates were ar
riving at 7:30, and we still didn't have
any dinner plans .... It was
impossible to find a car. Then some
one came up with the brilliant idea to
order take-out Chinese food. As it
started getting closer and closer to
delivery time, I knew they wouldn't
bring chopsticks — everyone else
thought they would — I was right.
"We also forgot about plates, so we
ended up having to scrounge around
the dorm for plates, bowls, anything.
We had to do the dishes before the
dinner. Anyway, we ended up eating
with plastic spoons on any sort of
plate. Our dates were really cool
about the whole affair, though," Pa
shigian said.
Unlike screw-your-roommate style
parties that pair each person with one
date, crush parties allow one to invite
a whole slew of likelies. Each resident
of the dorm throwing the crush party
invites a number of people on whom
he or she has a crush. Often invita
tions are given anonymously, thereby
enticing those invited to go and at
least find out who found them so ap
pealing.

However, freshman Chris Barlow,
who attended a crush party at
Ujaama, said, "A lot of people that
got invited didn't go."
Freshman Jason Greenman, an
other crush party attendee, seemed
dubious about the effectiveness of the
parties. "The problem with crush par
ties is that the people who are
crushed upon end up meeting each
other instead of those who invited
them," he said.
Perhaps Greenman would have
preferred the computer dating party

arranged by Cardenal for Alondra,
Faisan and Cardenal. The computer
match-up method is probably the
most effective and least time coasum
ing in terms of simply getting every
one a date. Anyone who fills out a
questionnaire receives a date —
maybe not one's dream date, but a
date nonetheless.
The computer matched people on
the basis of their compatability as de
termined by a questionnaire. Partici
pants answered questions ranging
from the mundane, " Do you prefer a

date who has: facial hair or no facial
hair?" to the racy, "How tar would
you go in public?"
The possible answers for the latter
question were: 1. A glance from
across the parking lot 2. A big grin
and a not-so-casual hello 3. Holding
hands in the dorm 4. A peck in the
doorway 5. Extensive groveling 6.
Disobeying hand-check call 7. Sex on
Flo Mo Field 8. Intense, overt, pas
sionate sex at house meeting.
The night of the party, each person
was handed a computer print-out
biography of their date and was intro
duced to them.
"It was like a slave auction," said
freshman Jennifer Boyd, recalling the
fact that the females had to stand in
dividually on a raised platform in
front of the group to allow their dates
to come up and "claim" them.
Commenting on her experience
with such parties, freshman Robin
Van Es said, "No matter how much
you have in common with somebody,
there's an inexplicable chemistry that
tells whether you'll hit it off or not.
Unfortunately. ..."
"Of course, they don't work out,"
Julie Berry said. "Since you know
from the beginning you're expected
to — you know. I guess it would be
hilarious if it really did work out, it'd
be something you tell your kids
about."
Perhaps the most unique blind date
party was that set up by the RAs of
Gavilan, Alondra and Larkin. The

theme of the party was date-for-a
dance (more if you like'em, ditch'em
if you don't)."
The questionnaire distributed to
participants reflected the relaxed ap
proach, asking questions such as
"What's your favorite cereal?" At the
party a list of pairings was posted up
for those interested in contacting
their "perfect match."
"Lots of people didn't even find
their dates. Some people looked half
heartedly. But the party was really
good," freshman Vivien Houng said.
Admittedly, these parties do not al
ways function as a way to meet new
people. What ever happened to Mr.
or Ms. Right in this mess? Wasn't
meeting them the whole point? Well,
meet freshman Gwen Loosmore and
sophomore Herb Chen. Loosmore
and Chen went on their first date
through the Car
denal/Faisan/Alondra Computer
Dating party — and they are still
dating.
A success story for blind date par
ties? Actually, Loosmore and Chen's
encounter was a little short of ran
dom. As one of the organizers of the
computer dating party, Chen did a bit
of maneuvering to get set up with
Loosmore.
"I'm glad I did it," Chen said. "I've
taken a lot of crap from the guys
about rigging the thing. But it was
worth it."
How sweet. Maybe, Prince Charm
ings do exist.
