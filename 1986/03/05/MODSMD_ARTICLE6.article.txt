# Committee opposes grade review group

### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
A Faculty Senate committee has decided to
oppose last year's proposal by the University's om
budsman to create a joint student-faculty commit
tee to research grading procedures at the Univer
sity, according to a report slated for discussion by
the full senate tomorrow.
The ombudsman, John Goheen, first proposed
formation of a student-faculty committee that
would "compare grading between comparable
classes" during a discussion with members of the
Faculty Senate Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA) last year.
"Sometimes the failure of the instructor to make
clear what the grading system is results in com
plaints," said Goheen, a professor emeritus in phil
osophy, and humanities and sciences who has

seived as assistant to the ombudsperson since his
retirement last year. "I think that the committee is
desirable to have, in view of the diversity of grading
procedures."
In its annual report for 1984-85, C-AAA notes
that it would be "useful" for instructors to reveal
their grading practices in course syllabi but advises
against forming a committee to deal exclusively
with student grade-related grievances.
The committee felt that "the problems were not
sufficiently severe to justify the formation of such a
committee," according to Nathaniel Gage, profes
sor of education and psychology and chairman of
C-AAA.
Specifically, Gage noted that the University gives
50,000 grades every academic quarter. Goheen has
said he receives about 200 complaints annually
about grading.
Summarizing other situations that could possibly

generate grading complaints from students,
Goheen said, "In multiple [teaching assistant]
courses, there is a problem of coordinating the
grading scale. Furthermore, some instructors grade
on a scale while others do not. This creates a source
of discrepancy in the way grading procedures are
conceived."
Referring to problems that may arise if grading
procedures are made more uniform, the report
said, "Questions of academic freedom may be in
volved in prohibiting instructors from using a priori
curves (for grading purposes) or in prohibiting in
structors from making judgement changes in end
of-the-quarter grades."
The report also noted that the percentage of in
structors giving final examinations in fall quarter
increased from 69 percent in 1982 to 81 percent in
1984.
