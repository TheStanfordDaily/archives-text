# Campus Shell signs new lease

### KEITH SEINFELD Staff writer 
The Campus Shell service station will change its
name — but not its mission — under a new lease
signed Friday, according to Gary Andrews, the sta
tion's operator since 1970.
The station, which now bears its owner s name —
Gary Andrews Campus Shell —will resume pump
ing gasoline next month. Andrews said. Gasoline
sales have been suspended while Andrews installs
new underground gasoline storage tanks to replace
those the Shell Oil Co. is currently removing.
Under the terms of the 10-year lease, which went

into effect on Saturday, Andrews leases the land
and the building from the University but owns the
business and pumping facilities.
Zera Murphy, University associate director for
Lands Management, said Shell, which leased the
station under an agreement that expired March 1,
withdrew from new lease negotiations last fall.
When other oil companies did not express an inter
est in leasing the site, Andrews began direct
negotiations with the University.
Andrews signed the new lease after securing the
funds and proper insurance to operate the station
as owner, Murphy said.
Murphy said Andrews must replace the gasoline

storage tanks to comply with a new state law re
quiring them to be double-contained and built of
fiberglass. The new tanks must also contain systems
to monitor for gas leaks.
"It will be a minimum of five weeks, possibly
eight weeks, before we're pumping gas again,"
Andrews said. "In the interim we will be negotiat
ing with several oil companies."
The station can either continue its affiliation with
Shell or contract through a different supplier, he
said.
Despite the halt in gasoline pumping, the sta
tion's service bays have continued to operate Mon
day through Friday, Andrews said.
