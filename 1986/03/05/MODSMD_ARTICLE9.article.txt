### KEVIN MONTAGUE 
Yesterday at approximately 6:30 p.m., a
basically harmless chemical spill at the Stauf
fer II Chemistry building was blown up into a
disproportionate mess.
M.G. Finn, a post-doctoral student in
porphryn chemistry, spilled approximately a
gallon of methylene chloride and acetone.
Although these are relatively harmless
chemicals, Finn followed correct procedure
and called the campus number for Health
and Safety.
Apparently, whoever took the call heard
"methyl chloride" rather than "methylene"
chloride — a big difference, for as Finn put

it, "Methylene chloride you can drink —
methyl chloride is slightly poisonous."
Because of this error, the fire department
was called, the building was closed, and no
one could resume work until a health inspec
tor came and deemed the premises safe, Finn
said.
Finn called the entire incident "horribly
embarrassing," adding, "It was all a misun
derstanding. The health inspector has to in
terrupt his dinner and spend an hour-and-a
half on the freeway .. . they might want to
trust us a little bit.
"It's not a story about a spill, it's a story
about the response to a spill," Finn said.
