In an area of Seattle, hardly larger than a city playground, a
group of teenagers survive as pimps, prostitutes, muggers,
panhandlers, petty thieves and small-time drug dealers.
Runaways and castaways, these kids survive with a sense of
style, humor and pride in their own knack for finding solutions to
the basic problems of bed and board. STREETWISE portrays
nine of these young peoples' lives between the ages of 13 and
19.
— A stunning documentary - Gene Siskel. Chicago Tribune
— Streetwise brings its subjects to life with an empathy and psychological depth
that few fiction films can manage anymore
- Molly Haskell. Vogue
— contains extraordinary everyday footage which the filmmakers obtained by
spending months hanging out with the kids, until they gamed their trust and
their cameras became accepted
- Roger Ebert. Chicago Sun-Times
Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary of 1984.
