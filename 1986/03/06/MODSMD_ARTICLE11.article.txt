### 
The recent controversy over proposed AIDS re
search by Hoover Institution fellows has rekindled the
issue of Hoover's relationship with the Univer
sity. A letter signed by 16 professors suggested that the
University end the "on-going embarrassment" and
divorce itself from Hoover. We believe the blatant and
persisting manifestation of Hoover's political partisan
ship requires immediate and fundamental changes at
Hoover.
Hoover is politically partisan a.v an institution, rather
than just as a collection of individuals. The institute
was founded in 1919 with a $50,000 donation from
Herbert Hoover and an explicit ideological mission: to
combat Marxism, atheism and obstacles to the free en
terprise system. The Dornbusch Report on the institu
tion correctly asserts that "misplaced partisanship does
harm." The lopsided and excessive number of Hoover
fellows appointed to the Reagan Administration
(approximately 40) is one clear illustration of this par
tisanship.
Does Stanford University want to continue its asso
ciation with Hoover as such? The University currently
provides 27 percent of Hoover's budget from its gen
eral fund; it owns the property and facilities that
Hoover fellows use; and it lends the Stanford
name to the Hoover Institution. In 1946, the
Board of Trustees adopted a plan to organize Hoover
as a separate division of the University. In 1986, the
board should again drastically restructure this relation
ship.
One concrete step to take is to exercise significantly
more control of the selection and appointment of
Hoover personnel. The Dornbusch Report proposes
that the University play an advisory role in the ap
pointment of senior fellows — but this is insufficient,
since according to the Ward Report on the institution:

"The powers of the director far exceed those of the
strongest departmental chairman or dean of a school.
Practically speaking, the director controls his own
budget and is the final authority on all matters of ap
pointments, finance, administration or policy." Thus it
is unlikely that a director like W. Glenn Campbell
would heed any advice of the University, as there are
no statutory requirements for him to do so.
The University should have greater representation
in the selection process of the director. Currently, the
search committee consists of three members who are
nominated by the University president and seven who
are from Hoover. This imbalanced ratio precludes the
necessary conditions for an objective selection; espe
cially when one considers the institutional bias of the
Hoover staff.
The University must take action now, rather than
push the issue aside into an entanglement of soon-to
be-forgotten committee investigations. The Hoover
Tower has come to symbolize institutionalized partisan
politics. It is the landmark of conservatism. The Uni
versity's present affiliation with Hoover is, effectively,
support for its premises, policies and practices. This
severely compromises Stanford's commitment to an
environment in which academic excellence is based on
a demonstrated diversity of opinion. The Hoover-
Stanford relationship does not befit a university which
claims to be dedicated to objective standards in the
promotion of higher learning and research.
With this in mind, it is time for Stanford to act
decisively in altering its present relationship with
Hoover. The University must either move to curb the
unabashedly partisan bent of the institition — thus as
suring a more balanced appointment of fellows — or it
must sever its ties with Hoover altogether.
