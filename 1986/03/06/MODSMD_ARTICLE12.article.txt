## Taking a stand isn't easy

"She looked up from her paper and said with exaspera

How ignorant is that? I can't even believe it.' "
This is a common scene for most of us: shock, surprise,
disgust and sometimes joy over what we read in the übiq
uitous Daily viewpoints, letters and columns. And that's
how it should be. The entire purpose of these opinions is
to get us to think about how we feel on an issue. Even bet
ter, we might discuss or argue the point being made.

How often, however, will we make the hardest move of
all — a motion that requires some real strength of charac
ter and self-confidence: taking a stand. Taking a stand in
volves deciding how we think about something and then
actively defending that belief.
The process gets harder the more people we address.
Around the dormitory dining table isn't too bad — some
casual acquaintances and friends going out on a limb. But
what about writing your ideas down, and offering them to
the world? Could you do that?
Last fall I wrote an innocuous little viewpoint on the
busy lifestyles of many resident assistants (RAs). It was
basically fluff. Not much was really said (certainly nothing
controversial). It was more of a "reminder" piece.
The impetus for it came from some fellow RAs who felt
the finals week/senior year/other commitments/RA re
sponsibilities crunch. I had been called by a few friends in
this situation for some advice. My response was simple:
Tell someone who you feel the "crunch" from (i.e. resi
dents, bosses, other residence staff).
They told me they couldn't do that. So I decided to
write a viewpoint to indirectly tell some pressure-placers

to ectoe on, and to tell others just to keep their eyes and
minds open.
And the viewpoint ran.
The headline was " Resident assistants are people too."
(Ahem. By the way, just for the record, the people who
write the stories or opinions don't write their own
headlines. As hard as it may be, try not to form an opinion
on the viewpoint from the headline.)
All my communication theory classes hadn't offered me
a clue as to the scope of The Daily's readership and their
attentiveness and their reactionary process. Response was
varied and numerous. Either you loved it or you hated it.
And most everyone felt this compelling need to tell me
how they felt.
After I recovered from the blow, I began to admire all
the "stand-takers" that I've supported or whined about
over the years. Everything from fraternity sexism a few
years ago to apartheid and on-campus racism has had an
opinion published about it. And I was stressing a bit over
the reaction to my "Busy RAs" piece.
The Daily's editorial board takes a stand every day.
This is done in a relatively anonymous manner as there is
no by-line (if you really want to know who they are call
The Daily). But everything else on the opinions page is di
rectly attributed to one person sticking his or her neck out
and taking a stand.
Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with
whatever opinion you're reading, stop and think "Could I
have expressed my feelings like that?" It takes a great
amount of strength of character to open oneself up for at
tack. And believe me, the best teacher (cliche coming...)
is experience.
But it feels great, even if you don't please everyone.
Strike that — especially because you don't please every
one; just as long as you've got them thinking.
