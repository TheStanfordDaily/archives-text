Resist Reagan's
unsound policies
Anger fills me when I look at the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Anger
and sadness for all the young men our
leaders put to death, all the families
they lied to and taxed and made suf
fer. Those young men were expen
dable pawns in the game of geo
strategy being played by the national
security elite.
The Senate abdicated responsibil
ity when it passed the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution; it believed too readily the
lies about "communist aggression,"
appropriated too easily the funds for
a war of repression, and resisted too
meekly the growing power of the ex
ecutive. The result was humiliation,
terror and grief for two peoples.
Today, too, the Congress is too
credulous and too ready to be cowed
by a strong-willed President and his
cadre of experts. The tenor of the
Reagan budget requests is that if
Congress doesn't give the president
exactly what he wants then the causes
of family, freedom and justice are
abandoned. Not accelerating the big
gest arms build-up in history is
"reckless, dangerous and wrong,"
and "may put peace itself at risk."
Not quintupling aid to the murderous
and repressive contras in Nicaragua
will hurt chances for "democracy"
there. Of course. Congress will
debate these things — but the debate
will be over whether to spend $311

billion or $305 billion on arms, $60
million or $50 million on aid. The
narrow range of choice and the
reasons members of Congress give for
their votes show they cannot stand up
to the president, no matter how out
rageous and dishonest his demands.
We can love and protect our
country, and at the same time actively
oppose the executive — that's what
America is about. How many more
dollars will be wasted, how many
more young men be killed, how many
more families aggrieved, before we
learn this?
Scott Bohning
Graduate, Civil Engineering
Leftist attacks on
Hoover are absurd
There seems to be a law of conser
vation of aggressiveness. In the
19505, the right was out to get various
leftists on charges of being allies of
Joseph Stalin. Today the left is out to
get whole institutions, e.g. Hoover,
on charges of being allies of President
Reagan.
Consider last Thursday's statement
by 16 Stanford professors. The idea
that the University can legitimately
disassociate itself from "on-going
embarrassment" by "divorcing itself'
from a part of itself is reminiscent of
my namesake Joe. The current casus
belli, two Hoover faculty members
taking part in a study that might reach
conclusions that offend the "gay com

munity," is absurd. Such fantasies can
only flourish in the intellectual equiv
alent of a backward village or party
cell, where any hint of deviation from
orthodox views is regarded as a sin.
I suppose the danger of their get
ting people fired is remote, but it's
worth remembering Voltaire's saying,
"Those who can make you believe
absurdities can make you commit
atrocities."
John McCarthy
Professor of Computer Science
People are part
of nature's plan
At the risk of starting a totally ir
relevant debate here on the Opinions
page, I would like to comment on S.J.
McCarthy's letter of Feb. 26, in which
he "explained" what the picture of
the cow at the Dish really was.
McCarthy complained that what was
shown in the picture was agriculture,
not nature as the caption read. I
would just like to say that agriculture
is part of nature. The human race
cannot remove itself from nature.
The fact that we humans have intelli
gence is not justification to exclude us
from nature. Human intelligence is a
totally natural fact.
It is also totally natural for humans
to develop our surroundings in a way
that we feel is more advantageous. I
don't think that McCarthy or any
other human would exclude a pond
created by beaver dam from nature.

even though the creation of a pond
might forever change the ecosystem
of the area it was in. Why then does
he exclude Stanford's grassy, cow
laden hills from the realm of nature?
It was totally natural for humans to
migrate into this area. It was also to
tally natural to change those hillsides
by placing cows up there. If it wasn't
natural, it would not have occurred.
I'm not saying that we shouldn't
consider all angles and exert utmost
care when we change the ecology of
an area, I'm merely saying that
humans should stop being so self
important that we remove ourselves
from nature. The presence of the cow
on the hill is natural. The dying off of
the oak trees (which the presence of
the cows causes) is natural. In fact,
the presence of the Dish on top of the
hill is also natural. A more correct
caption to the picture, although less
specific, would have been "Nature."

rageous and dishonest his demands.
We can love and protect our
country, and at the same time actively
oppose the executive — that's what
America is about. How many more
dollars will be wasted, how many
more young men be killed, how many
more families aggrieved, before we
learn this?

Leftist attacks on
Hoover are absurd
There seems to be a law of conser
vation of aggressiveness. In the
19505, the right was out to get various
leftists on charges of being allies of
Joseph Stalin. Today the left is out to
get whole institutions, e.g. Hoover,
on charges of being allies of President
Reagan.
Consider last Thursday's statement
by 16 Stanford professors. The idea
that the University can legitimately
disassociate itself from "on-going
embarrassment" by "divorcing itself'
from a part of itself is reminiscent of
my namesake Joe. The current casus
belli, two Hoover faculty members
taking part in a study that might reach
conclusions that offend the "gay com

munity," is absurd. Such fantasies can
only flourish in the intellectual equiv
alent of a backward village or party
cell, where any hint of deviation from
orthodox views is regarded as a sin.
I suppose the danger of their get
ting people fired is remote, but it's
worth remembering Voltaire's saying,
"Those who can make you believe
absurdities can make you commit
atrocities."
John McCarthy
Professor of Computer Science
People are part
of nature's plan
At the risk of starting a totally ir
relevant debate here on the Opinions
page, I would like to comment on S.J.
McCarthy's letter of Feb. 26, in which
he "explained" what the picture of
the cow at the Dish really was.
McCarthy complained that what was
shown in the picture was agriculture,
not nature as the caption read. I
would just like to say that agriculture
is part of nature. The human race
cannot remove itself from nature.
The fact that we humans have intelli
gence is not justification to exclude us
from nature. Human intelligence is a
totally natural fact.
It is also totally natural for humans
to develop our surroundings in a way
that we feel is more advantageous. I
don't think that McCarthy or any
other human would exclude a pond
created by beaver dam from nature.

even though the creation of a pond
might forever change the ecosystem
of the area it was in. Why then does
he exclude Stanford's grassy, cow
laden hills from the realm of nature?
It was totally natural for humans to
migrate into this area. It was also to
tally natural to change those hillsides
by placing cows up there. If it wasn't
natural, it would not have occurred.
I'm not saying that we shouldn't
consider all angles and exert utmost
care when we change the ecology of
an area, I'm merely saying that
humans should stop being so self
important that we remove ourselves
from nature. The presence of the cow
on the hill is natural. The dying off of
the oak trees (which the presence of
the cows causes) is natural. In fact,
the presence of the Dish on top of the
hill is also natural. A more correct
caption to the picture, although less
specific, would have been "Nature."

Resist Reagan's
unsound policies
Anger fills me when I look at the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Anger
and sadness for all the young men our
leaders put to death, all the families
they lied to and taxed and made suf
fer. Those young men were expen
dable pawns in the game of geo
strategy being played by the national
security elite.
The Senate abdicated responsibil
ity when it passed the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution; it believed too readily the
lies about "communist aggression,"
appropriated too easily the funds for
a war of repression, and resisted too
meekly the growing power of the ex
ecutive. The result was humiliation,
terror and grief for two peoples.
Today, too, the Congress is too
credulous and too ready to be cowed
by a strong-willed President and his
cadre of experts. The tenor of the
Reagan budget requests is that if
Congress doesn't give the president
exactly what he wants then the causes
of family, freedom and justice are
abandoned. Not accelerating the big
gest arms build-up in history is
"reckless, dangerous and wrong,"
and "may put peace itself at risk."
Not quintupling aid to the murderous
and repressive contras in Nicaragua
will hurt chances for "democracy"
there. Of course. Congress will
debate these things — but the debate
will be over whether to spend $311

billion or $305 billion on arms, $60
million or $50 million on aid. The
narrow range of choice and the
reasons members of Congress give for
their votes show they cannot stand up
to the president, no matter how out
rageous and dishonest his demands.
We can love and protect our
country, and at the same time actively
oppose the executive — that's what
America is about. How many more
dollars will be wasted, how many
more young men be killed, how many
more families aggrieved, before we
learn this?
