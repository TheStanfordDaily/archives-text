# Paralyzed by nightmares
## 
### 
Rip away from the moorings of reality for a moment,
and imagine the jolt of pure adrenalin that would hit
your stomach if the door to your room burst open and a
man ran in, fired a handgun into your roommate's head
and then turned the gun on you.
What are you going to do? You have about 1.3 seconds.
You will probably stare at him as he kills you. It is what
most people would do. It is what the young woman at
Cornell to whom this happened a few years ago did. The
man was the jilted boyfriend of one of the two students.
After killing both women, he got back in his car, was
quickly pursued by police, and, when he realized that he
would be captured, turned the gun on himself.
We hear stories like that now and again, but we don't
think about them for very long. They are bad dreams
come true; but they are someone else's dreams, and they
do not touch us. We transform the more grotesque and
enduring tales into ghost stories, modern folklore stem
ming from the transient media of newspapers and televi
sion, and give them permanency by our word-of-mouth.
But as a rule, we do not think about these incidents. We
cannot, for to do so would be crippling.

If these events fade, they do not disappear entirely.
They insinuate themselves into a remote space in our
minds, and prime us to give responses we are at a loss to
explain. They infect us, soak us like a rag in gasoline, until
we need only the briefest suggestion of danger to ignite a
rush of raw instinct we thought civilization and its routine
had long ago dulled.
I lived in Texas last summer with a friend I'll call John.
John is Taiwanese, and sometimes when we walked
around downtown Austin on Saturday night, a group of
guys would start shouting that John should go back to
China, or they'd call him names. Other times, they would
simply watch us walk by, and speak quiet obscenities as
we passed.
Coming from Georgia, I had a better than average
grasp of the danger inherent in racial tension. I knew, too,
the potential for sudden violence specific to hot regions of
the country possessing an ethic of machismo which
dictated that you don't take any shit from anybody, not
even a little bit. And although I didn't (and don't) believe
Texas to be so much more dangerous than any other state,
I had heard stories from people who lived there: gunfights
over who reached a parking place first, people killed in
fights over property markers â€” things of that nature. A
friend of mine had grown up next door to a man who, one
hot summer day, walked into a small church and opened
fire with a shotgun, killing seven people before he killed
himself. These and other stories lingered in the back of my
mind.
One night in June, John and I were at a Popeye's
chicken place when a bunch of guys walked in. Seeing

John they began to stare. A ripple passed through the
group, not quite intelligible, a low and dangerous noise.
Alarms went off in my head like clocks.
Nothing happened. They laughed at something, and
then ignored us. Even so, it had made us both nervous.
For about 20 minutes after something like that happens, I
am in a state of alert. I begin, without really thinking
about it, to note the location of exits, look for cover from
gunfire and size up passersby as possible opponents.
Eventually, this period of alarm passes, and I feel foolish
for having felt it.
John and I leave Popeye's, and the guys say something
as we walk past. We get into the car and swing out into
rush-hour traffic. It is getting dark, and most of the cars in
Lamar Boulevard's dense traffic have turned on their
headlights. Coming up behind us on the right is a car with
its lights off. John asks me to say something to them.
We pull up to a stoplight, and I roll down my window.
In the car opposite me are two young men. "Did you
know your lights are off?" I ask. The driver looks at me
without answering. Thinking maybe their headlights
simply don't work, I try to rephrase the question to give
them the benefit of the doubt: "Do you have lights?" is
what comes out of my mouth.
They are silent. We look at each other. I try to think of
another way to say it, and can't. Then, a subtle change of
expression comes into the driver's face, a look signifying
comprehension and something else, and he gives me a
smile that says, Just a minute, I have something for you.
He bends down and reaches under the driver's seat.
We are locked in bumper-to-bumper traffic, hemmed in
on all sides by other cars. The man continues to rummage
under his seat. There is no doubt in my mind what he is
looking for, and all I can do is sit there and wait for him to
find it. My mind screams at me to move, but there is
nowhere to go, and even if there were, I could not have
moved a muscle. I watch as the driver locates what he is
looking for, straightens up and, turning to me, thrusts his
arm through the window, and though I still can't see what
he has in his hand, I know he's pointing it at my chest. I
stare at his hand. In it is a Bic lighter. He had understood
" Do you have lights?" as " Do you have a light?" We clear
up the confusion, they turn on their lights, and everybody
goes home.
Back at the house, we joke about it over a few beers.
But sometime around 5 that morning I wake up for no ap
parent reason, and John is awake, sitting at the foot of his
bed. I ask why he isn't asleep. He is still shaken by what
happened this afternoon, he replies. I laugh, and say I
thought I was the only one who had let his imagination
run out of control. "Are you kidding?" he says."I thought
he was going to kill as."
I don't know whether my caution is irrational or not;
but since that time I am unable to watch a stranger reach
into his coat pocket in a public place without tensing up. It
is nothing terribly dramatic; I simply cannot look away
until I have seen what he has in his hand. Much of human
behavior is, after all, learned. To some extent, people are
like computers: you get out of them essentially what you
put in. Every now and then, something happens that lets
us know just exactly what is being put in us, even if we are
not aware of its presence, even if we do not know how it
got there, even if we want, more than anything else, for it
simply to go away and leave us alone.
