# Employee claims unfair treatment
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
An employee in the University's Procurement
Office has filed a complaint that she was unfairly
demoted by her supervisor.
The complainant, Betty Walker, claims that her
supervisor, Jim Gallaher, treated her unfairly
during the time she held the position of manager of
Special Contracts.
Walker said she was terminated as manager
without due process and in an unreasonable appli

employee who has been promoted is not required
to serve an additional trial period.

constituted a trial period with his Nov. 18, 1985,
letter to her, which stated: "It is normal procedure
in the Controller's Office for a person assuming a
new position to be closely observed and reviewed
during their first six months in the new role."
Though an official decision remains to be made
concerning the procedure through which Walker's
complaint will be processed, Walker is seeking
redress through the University's procedure for
Resolution Through an Outside Hearing Officer.
Officials from employee relations say the appropri

plaint is the grievance procedure.
Some University employees acquainted with the

case believe it could involve racial or sexual dis
crimination. However, Walker, a black female, is
not filing a racial or sexual discrimination com
plaint at this time.
Walker was promoted on Oct. 12, 1985, to the
manager of special contracts position. She claimed
that she was on the same day informed by Gallaher
that "she was not his first choice" and that he
would "call (her) on anything right on the spot."
Gallaher denied having made such statements.
