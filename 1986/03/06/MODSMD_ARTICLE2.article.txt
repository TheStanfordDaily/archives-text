# Employee claims unfair treatment
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
An employee in the University's Procurement
Office has filed a complaint that she was unfairly
demoted by her supervisor.
The complainant, Betty Walker, claims that her
supervisor, Jim Gallaher, treated her unfairly
during the time she held the position of manager of
Special Contracts.
Walker said she was terminated as manager
without due process and in an unreasonable appli
cation of University policy, which states that an
employee who has been promoted is not required
to serve an additional trial period.

Walker claims that Gallaher placed her in what
constituted a trial period with his Nov. 18, 1985,
letter to her, which stated: "It is normal procedure
in the Controller's Office for a person assuming a
new position to be closely observed and reviewed
during their first six months in the new role."
Though an official decision remains to be made
concerning the procedure through which Walker's
complaint will be processed, Walker is seeking
redress through the University's procedure for
Resolution Through an Outside Hearing Officer.
Officials from employee relations say the appropri
ate means through which to process Walker's com
plaint is the grievance procedure.
Some University employees acquainted with the

case believe it could involve racial or sexual dis
crimination. However, Walker, a black female, is
not filing a racial or sexual discrimination com
plaint at this time.
Walker was promoted on Oct. 12, 1985, to the
manager of special contracts position. She claimed
that she was on the same day informed by Gallaher
that "she was not his first choice" and that he
would "call (her) on anything right on the spot."
Gallaher denied having made such statements.
Walker clas3i£d she was thereafter hindered
from successfully fulfilling her duties in that Gal
laher denied her signature authority, restricted her
authority to delegate responsibilty and removed
the personal computer from her new office.
Gallaher claimed that the partial restriction of
Walker's signature authority was due to a legal
ambiguity and later cleared up. He denied having
restricted her authority to delegate responsibility
and asserts that he offered to move the personal
computer from Walker's prior office to her new of
fice.
These statements are not, like Walker's com
plaints, to be found in written form in the official
correspondence in Walker's file.
On Nov. 22, 1985, Gallaher informed Walker
that her former position, that of senior contract
specialist, had been put on "hold" until he and
Walker could "work through the issues of [her] ad
justment to the management role."
On Dec. 20, 1985, and Jan. 24, 1986, Walker
wrote letters to Gallaher regarding what she felt to
be his inequitable treatment of her as a manager.
Feb. 6. Walker filed a complaint with the Uni

versity after Gallaher verbally informed her that
she was terminated. Two days later, Gallaher told
Walker she had not been terminated but ter
minated as manager and demoted to her former
position.
Gallaher claimed that he was led to terminate and
then re-hire Walker because a personal conflict
developed between the two "over a period of three
or four weeks" until "she finally reftised to talk to
me. ... It came to the point where we could no
longer work together."
Walker claimed no real conflict developed be
tween herself and Gallaher until she sent Gallaher
her letter of Jan. 24 which she had insisted be
placed in her file. This letter outlined her concerns
and complaints about both her own situation as
manager and the handling of a specific procure
ment contract for shuttle buses.
Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the Row
Office, is acquainted with Walker's complaints and
claimed they "raise questions as to possible racism
or sexism, or, at the least, bad employment and
evaluation processes."
Archuleta pointed out that Walker's credentials
are superior to those of Larry Wolfson, who has

filled Walker's former position of manager. Walker
has received a bachelor's degree in management
and a master's of business administration in
procurement and is one of 1,900 certified profes
sional contract managers in the country. Walker
was* ranked second in procurement cost savings
after saving the University more than $500,000 last
quarter.
When the qualities of Walker's credentials were
pointed out to Manager of Employee Relations
Felix Barthelemy, he stated that "credentials don't
necessarily define a person's qualifications."
Archuleta, on the other hand, stated that it is in
teresting that "while the response to Affirmative
Action's requests for more black employees has
typically been that there is not a qualified pool of
black applicants, we have a case here where the
University is saying that official qualifications are
not enough. What does it take for a black woman to
be hired by the University?"
Barthelemy further pointed out that it would
have been illogical for Gallaher to hire Walker as
manager if he had had plans to fire her. Walker
claimed Gallaher hired her as manager only under
the "coercion" of an outside committee reviewing
the finalists for the position.

fice.
These statements are not, like Walker's com
plaints, to be found in written form in the official
correspondence in Walker's file.
On Nov. 22, 1985, Gallaher informed Walker
that her former position, that of senior contract
specialist, had been put on "hold" until he and
Walker could "work through the issues of [her] ad
justment to the management role."
On Dec. 20, 1985, and Jan. 24, 1986, Walker
wrote letters to Gallaher regarding what she felt to
be his inequitable treatment of her as a manager.
Feb. 6. Walker filed a complaint with the Uni

versity after Gallaher verbally informed her that
she was terminated. Two days later, Gallaher told
Walker she had not been terminated but ter
minated as manager and demoted to her former
position.
Gallaher claimed that he was led to terminate and
then re-hire Walker because a personal conflict
developed between the two "over a period of three
or four weeks" until "she finally reftised to talk to
me. ... It came to the point where we could no
longer work together."
Walker claimed no real conflict developed be
tween herself and Gallaher until she sent Gallaher
her letter of Jan. 24 which she had insisted be
placed in her file. This letter outlined her concerns
and complaints about both her own situation as
manager and the handling of a specific procure
ment contract for shuttle buses.
Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the Row
Office, is acquainted with Walker's complaints and
claimed they "raise questions as to possible racism
or sexism, or, at the least, bad employment and
evaluation processes."
Archuleta pointed out that Walker's credentials
are superior to those of Larry Wolfson, who has

filled Walker's former position of manager. Walker
has received a bachelor's degree in management
and a master's of business administration in
procurement and is one of 1,900 certified profes
sional contract managers in the country. Walker
was* ranked second in procurement cost savings
after saving the University more than $500,000 last
quarter.
When the qualities of Walker's credentials were
pointed out to Manager of Employee Relations
Felix Barthelemy, he stated that "credentials don't
necessarily define a person's qualifications."
Archuleta, on the other hand, stated that it is in
teresting that "while the response to Affirmative
Action's requests for more black employees has
typically been that there is not a qualified pool of
black applicants, we have a case here where the
University is saying that official qualifications are
not enough. What does it take for a black woman to
be hired by the University?"
Barthelemy further pointed out that it would
have been illogical for Gallaher to hire Walker as
manager if he had had plans to fire her. Walker
claimed Gallaher hired her as manager only under
the "coercion" of an outside committee reviewing
the finalists for the position.
An employee in the University's Procurement
Office has filed a complaint that she was unfairly
demoted by her supervisor.
The complainant, Betty Walker, claims that her
supervisor, Jim Gallaher, treated her unfairly
during the time she held the position of manager of
Special Contracts.
Walker said she was terminated as manager
without due process and in an unreasonable appli
cation of University policy, which states that an
employee who has been promoted is not required
to serve an additional trial period.

Walker claims that Gallaher placed her in what
constituted a trial period with his Nov. 18, 1985,
letter to her, which stated: "It is normal procedure
in the Controller's Office for a person assuming a
new position to be closely observed and reviewed
during their first six months in the new role."
Though an official decision remains to be made
concerning the procedure through which Walker's
complaint will be processed, Walker is seeking
redress through the University's procedure for
Resolution Through an Outside Hearing Officer.
Officials from employee relations say the appropri
ate means through which to process Walker's com
plaint is the grievance procedure.
Some University employees acquainted with the

case believe it could involve racial or sexual dis
crimination. However, Walker, a black female, is
not filing a racial or sexual discrimination com
plaint at this time.
Walker was promoted on Oct. 12, 1985, to the
manager of special contracts position. She claimed
that she was on the same day informed by Gallaher
that "she was not his first choice" and that he
would "call (her) on anything right on the spot."
Gallaher denied having made such statements.
Walker clas3i£d she was thereafter hindered
from successfully fulfilling her duties in that Gal
laher denied her signature authority, restricted her
authority to delegate responsibilty and removed
the personal computer from her new office.
Gallaher claimed that the partial restriction of
Walker's signature authority was due to a legal
ambiguity and later cleared up. He denied having
restricted her authority to delegate responsibility
and asserts that he offered to move the personal
computer from Walker's prior office to her new of
fice.

plaints, to be found in written form in the official
