## Search for 'the Cap'n' is over 
### BOB FRANKLIN 
After a mysterious six-month ab
sence, Cap'n Crunch will soon return
to his rightful place â€” on the front of
his cheery red cereal box. And kids
all over the world have Stanford's
own Eric Sorenson, a senior, to thank
for the Cap'n's return.
Sorenson admits that his grueling,
two-hour Cap'n-hunt was dangerous,
but he said that he thinks the search
was worth it.
"I've done the kids of the world a
great service by finding the Cap'n,"
Sorenson said.
For the past six months, the Cap'n
has been missing from the front of his
cereal boxes. The Quaker Oats com
pany decided to sponsor a
nation-wide sweepstakes for young
detectives like Sorenson to recover
the Cap'n and have a chance to win
part of the $1 million in reward
money.
His efforts were promptly
recognized by a reward of $ 100 and,
more importantly, a thank-you letter
from the Cap'n himself, who
recognized and applauded his
"excellent detective skills."
Junior Ashley Quinn, who had
been worried about the Cap'n's dis
appearance, was pleased to learn of
his rescue. "Thank God," she sighed.
What began innocently as a Friday
afternoon snack last quarter ended in
a dramatic chase which took Soren
son to a mummy's tomb, the Wild
West and a haunted house. Armed
only with his Detective Crunch ID,
his Ultra Red Spy lens, his pathfinder
and his official code breaker, Soren
son sought out the clues leading to
the Cap'n's whereabouts.
But it wasn't just all fun and games.
"I was scared," Sorenson admitted.
"The Haunted House really scared
me."
However, he plunged forward
anyway. "I knew I had an important
mission to complete, " he said.
Aware of this duty, he was taken

on a wild and often dangerous pursuit
to Atlantis, the Center of the Earth,
Crunch Island and the Milky Way,
where the Cap'n was ultimately
found.
The Cap'n said in his letter that he
was able to remain in the Milky Way
safely for so long because "I beat
Squish the Sogmaster, and because
my Cap'n Crunch cereal stays
crunchy in milk for a long, long
time."
Sorenson said that he remembers
vividly the day he was notified of his
success in solving the mystery. He
opened the letter and almost tossed it
away when he saw "Where's the
Cap'n? Sweepstakes" written at the
top of the page.
"I thought it was a piece of junk
mail, just another sweepstakes. But
then I read on, and the check said
'Pay to the order of Eric E. Sorenson
the amount $100 and zero cents.' I
still didn't believe it. I said, 'No way.
This is probably just a joke that the
Cap'n is playing on me.' "
But after reading the accompany

ing letter, he knew it was true and
"dashed away with excitement." He
went home and ate one of his four
daily bowls of Cap'n Crunch and
toasted the Cap'n.
Sorenson said that he plans to go to
Florida after finals. "This Spring
Break is on the Cap'n," he said.
He admitted that was hesitant
about declaring the reward money on
his income taxes, but finally declared
it when he reasoned that "the govern
ment knows who found the Cap'n and
would have audited me if I didn't
declare it."
Sorenson said that he feels his res
cue of the Cap'n will help him in the
job market, and he also noted that it
didn't take much to mail in his an
swer. "If 1 didn't send (my answer) in,
the stamp would have sat in my
drawer," he said. "Besides, finding
the Cap'n doesn't look too bad on my
resume.
"Everyone who knew me laughed
at me for mailing in the Where's the
Cap'n entry form," Sorenson said.
"And now I have the last laugh."
