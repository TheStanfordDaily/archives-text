Fun things to do in the snow in the Ivy League: Part I
Ah, fair Harvard. The centuries-old halls, the ivied
walls, the hallowed Yard, the Kool-Aid-flavored quad
rangle.
That's right — Kool-Aid-flavored quadrangle.
Seems as though a couple of Harvard sophomores, Mi
chael Chessler and Sergio Huidor, decided to spruce
up Radcliffe Quadrangle with $300 worth of the sweet
stuff a couple of weeks ago, and did.
The two sprinkled over 1,000 packets of grape,
tropical fruit and lemonade crystals on the virgin-white
snow. What's more, this was a project that was offi
cially sponsored by the university. Believe it or not.
The crystal-sprinkling was funded by a group called
the Harvard Council for the Arts, which awards money
to "innovative new arts projects," according to The
Harvard Crimson.
The two organizers billed the flavorful undertaking a
"Mass Aesthetic Event,"and about 50students helped
sprinkle the powder, according to The Crimson.
"It was a hell of an idea," said sophomore Richard
Borovoy, one of the sprinklers. "People say that we at
Harvard don't have enough fun here, but this is the
sort of wacky fun thing to do that still has that intellec
tual flair everyone always seems to worry about."
Borovoy was also impressed with the colored snow's
cosmic significance. "This is the kind of art that has
meaning over time," he claimed. Yeah, meaning over a
time of about five minutes, maybe.
Oh well. Harvard will be Harvard. At least the art
was tasteful.
Anyone for sprinkling Nestle's Quik over the Quad?
Fun things to do in the snow in the Ivy League: Part II
While students at Harvard were busy flavoring the
snow with Kool-Aid, students at another Ivy League
institution were busy sledding on it. A favorite Eli
pastime, according to The Yale Daily News, is sliding

down the campus hills on meal trays.
"I suppose it's dangerous, but it's nothing to worry
about," said sophomore Susan Kleckner. Although
there is a huge iron grate at the bottom.
Yale students were not in agreement as to the best
way to the bottom of the hill. "The best way is going
down in a train," said sophomore Lisa Friedman.
"Some people like to go down on their stomachs,"
claimed Kleckner. And there are other positions: the
"hostage hold," where two "trayers" go down the hill
back-to-back, and the "snow circle," in which more
than two lock arms and venture down the slope.
All the students, though, agreed that sliding down a
hill on a meal tray is an experience not to be missed.
"It's a matchless experience," Kleckner said. "Nothing
comes close, not even buying the first floor at Tif
fany's," she gushed.
Well. How about that. Buying the first floor at Tif
fany's is not the best possible experience anyone could
ever have.
Bill the Cat for President
Bill the Cat is one step closer to the presidency of the
United States this week. The "Bloom County" charac
ter, who has long had a hankering to meow in the Oval
Office, retained his seat last month in the UC-Berkeley
Student Senate, The Daily Californian reported.
"I value my senate seat," Bill — a.k.a. Berkeley stu
dent Timothy Feeley — told the senate. "And with
your permission, I'll be able to continue."
Indeed, the fiesty feline is having some trouble with
his colleagues in the senate. Some of them, like fellow
senator Russell DeLeon, think that Feeley should use
his real name.
"Do we want to treat the senate like a sandbox?"
DeLeon asked. "Do we want bills supported by Bill
the Cat sent to the state legislature?"
Bill, however, remained nonplussed by all the chaos.
