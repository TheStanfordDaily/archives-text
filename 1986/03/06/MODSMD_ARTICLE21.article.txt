Fun things to do in the snow in the Ivy League: Part I
Ah, fair Harvard. The centuries-old halls, the ivied
walls, the hallowed Yard, the Kool-Aid-flavored quad
rangle.
That's right — Kool-Aid-flavored quadrangle.
Seems as though a couple of Harvard sophomores, Mi
chael Chessler and Sergio Huidor, decided to spruce
up Radcliffe Quadrangle with $300 worth of the sweet
stuff a couple of weeks ago, and did.
The two sprinkled over 1,000 packets of grape,
tropical fruit and lemonade crystals on the virgin-white
snow. What's more, this was a project that was offi
cially sponsored by the university. Believe it or not.
The crystal-sprinkling was funded by a group called
the Harvard Council for the Arts, which awards money
to "innovative new arts projects," according to The
Harvard Crimson.
The two organizers billed the flavorful undertaking a
"Mass Aesthetic Event,"and about 50students helped
sprinkle the powder, according to The Crimson.
"It was a hell of an idea," said sophomore Richard
Borovoy, one of the sprinklers. "People say that we at
Harvard don't have enough fun here, but this is the
sort of wacky fun thing to do that still has that intellec
tual flair everyone always seems to worry about."
Borovoy was also impressed with the colored snow's
cosmic significance. "This is the kind of art that has
meaning over time," he claimed. Yeah, meaning over a
time of about five minutes, maybe.
Oh well. Harvard will be Harvard. At least the art
was tasteful.
Anyone for sprinkling Nestle's Quik over the Quad?
Fun things to do in the snow in the Ivy League: Part II
While students at Harvard were busy flavoring the
snow with Kool-Aid, students at another Ivy League
institution were busy sledding on it. A favorite Eli
pastime, according to The Yale Daily News, is sliding

down the campus hills on meal trays.
"I suppose it's dangerous, but it's nothing to worry
about," said sophomore Susan Kleckner. Although
there is a huge iron grate at the bottom.
Yale students were not in agreement as to the best
way to the bottom of the hill. "The best way is going
down in a train," said sophomore Lisa Friedman.
"Some people like to go down on their stomachs,"
claimed Kleckner. And there are other positions: the
"hostage hold," where two "trayers" go down the hill
back-to-back, and the "snow circle," in which more
than two lock arms and venture down the slope.
All the students, though, agreed that sliding down a
hill on a meal tray is an experience not to be missed.
"It's a matchless experience," Kleckner said. "Nothing
comes close, not even buying the first floor at Tif
fany's," she gushed.
Well. How about that. Buying the first floor at Tif
fany's is not the best possible experience anyone could
ever have.
Bill the Cat for President
Bill the Cat is one step closer to the presidency of the
United States this week. The "Bloom County" charac
ter, who has long had a hankering to meow in the Oval
Office, retained his seat last month in the UC-Berkeley
Student Senate, The Daily Californian reported.
"I value my senate seat," Bill — a.k.a. Berkeley stu
dent Timothy Feeley — told the senate. "And with
your permission, I'll be able to continue."
Indeed, the fiesty feline is having some trouble with
his colleagues in the senate. Some of them, like fellow
senator Russell DeLeon, think that Feeley should use
his real name.
"Do we want to treat the senate like a sandbox?"
DeLeon asked. "Do we want bills supported by Bill
the Cat sent to the state legislature?"
Bill, however, remained nonplussed by all the chaos.
In fact, Feeley claimed that he has
always been called Bill; students
on his dormitory floor gave him
the nickname last fall, he said.
Who knows? Maybe they've
started a trend in Berkeley.
Rumor has it that Opus declares
his candidacy for the ASSU senate
next week.
And the scary thing is that these
kids will be designing cars someday
Purdue student Robin Barrett
and his 13 teammates received
$ 150 two weeks ago for designing
what they called "the world's most
complicated toothpaste dis
penser," according to The Michi
gan Daily.
If you really want to know,
here's how the contraption works:
First, a spring releases the Ding
Dong, which flies through the air
and hits the picture of Khadafy.
Then two croquet balls cause a
water-loaded rocket to shoot out
and pull a string, which releases a
pin. The pin then activates the
Barbie doll and a King Kong doll
to climb up the side of a model of
the Empire State Building. The
climbing action pulls a string that
sets off a switch turning a water
wheel in an aquarium. The water
wheel then sets off another switch,
which starts a drill press that
squeezes the toothpaste tube. Fi
nally.

What can this terrible thing be?
Something is wrong at the Uni
versity of Michigan's Medical Sci
ence Building. Something terribly
wrong. And it can t be explained.
There used to be a lot of empty
pop cans in the building. The
people who worked there were
saving them so they could recycle
them. But all this was before the
thing came.
On Jan. 15, more than 30
empty pop cans were stolen from
the building's West Lecture Hall.
A week later, more cans were
stolen. And two days after that,
still more empty aluminum cans
were taken from the building.
So the people at the University
of Michigan's Medical Sciences
Building decided to lock up the
cans. Wouldn't you? But this
thing, this terrifying — what can
we call it? — this horrible Can
Monster broke the lock. And stole
the cans.
Then the people in the building
got scared. Real scared. This is a
job, they thought, for the police.
But the police could not help.
No; this thing seemed to thrive'
even more: it began stealing other
things. Things like teabags,
styrofoam cups and instant coffee
packets.
"Teabags just don't disappear,"
one concerned employee in the
building said. And he was right.
Teabags don't just disappear.
And the worst part, the most
terrible part, is that this thing is
still at large.
Hide your cans.
