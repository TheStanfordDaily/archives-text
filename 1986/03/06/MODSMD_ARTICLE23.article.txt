## Despite strong cast and rapid action, 'Power' fails Neither Gere nor Hackman can save this muckraking movie from shallowness 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Gene Hackman has had the dis
tinction of appearing in three of the
worst major American movies of the
last six months: "Target," "Twice in a
Lifetime" and now "Power," which
may be the most entertainingly bad
picture of the lot.
In "Power" Hackman plays
Wilfred Buckley, a media consultant
with a conscience (he only works for
candidates he can believe in) who's
on the slide. In one scene, Buckley
storms off a plane in Santa Fe falling
down drunk, hurling insults at a
former associate and raring to work
on the New Mexico governorship
race.
Later we see him wearing a seer
sucker suit and a stringy bow tie,
looking as if he had just arrived from
up north for the Scopes Monkey
Trial. Hackman brazens his way
through these scenes, but he seems
more lost than anyone else in this
movie, possibly because he's the most
conscientious of the performers gath
ered here. In "Power," director Sid
ney Lumet substitutes high energy for
narrative coherence, and he keeps the
movie jumping along. The actors
keep running (and tripping and fall
ing) to keep up the pace.
The ads for "Power" feature the
line "More seductive than sex . . .
more precious than gold." Not to
worry — there's plenty of money and
sex involved in this "behind the
scenes expose" of media manipula
tion in political campaigns.
The central character is Pete St.
John (Richard Gere), a political
kingmaker with no ethical or emo
tional stake in his clients. St. John
spends as much time in a plane as on
the ground, juggling four different
campaigns in South America, Seattle,
New Mexico and Ohio. In terms of
the plot, this is at least two campaigns
too many, and we spend a lot of time
in that plane with him, listening to the
drum solo in Benny Goodman's

"Sing, Sing, Sing" (St. John plays it
constantly over stereo headphones).
Without the rumba beat in these
transition scenes, the energy level
would drop and the movie would
grind to a halt.
Lumet is all fired up to make an in
dictment of campaign manipulation
with this movie, but nothing he and
screenwriter David Himmelstein
have to say is very fresh or exciting.
In interviews, the filmmakers decry
the buying, selling and packaging of
political candidates, and in "Power"
they unveil every instance of media

manipulation as if it were a sparkling,
newly revealed truth.
Lumet and Himmelstein may be
the only people left in the country
who are shocked by these revelations;
most Americans know our election
system is ridiculous, but no one seems
to care much. This is not the time for
a muckraking indictment of the poli
tical process — not when that process
has just wiped out the last vestiges of
the Nixon era, and put the most
popular president since FDR into of
fice. And this is clearly not the time
for muckraking political movies —

not after the commercial failure of
films like "Blow Out" and "Under
Fire."
None of this is to suggest that
"Power" is a successful indictment of
anything. Of all the entertainment
arts, movies are in the worst position
to be calling the game of packaging
and image-making foul, and "Power"
is so phony it makes the campaign ads
we see the characters cooking up look
naturalistic by comparison.
St. John rushes from one high-tech,
plushly padded office to the next,
looking awesomely neat and

glamorous and beautiful. He beds
gorgeous women and makes loads of
money; for two filmmakers interested
in exposing the corrupt shallowness
of politics, Lumet and Himmelstein
seem suspiciously taken by all the
surface glitz and glitter of St. John's
lifestyle.
They hold up a venerable senator
as their model of a "good"
politician; we can tell he has integrity
because he's the only one who
doesn't work in a high-rise, glass
enclosed office space. The movie's
symbol for honest, sincere govern
ment is an old, leather-bound,
mahagony high-backed chair. E. G.
Marshall (looking fraught with
worry) is cast as the old senator, with
Beatrice Straight as his wife.
J. T. Walsh is the ruthless young
Senate hopeful, and his headquarters
look like a James Bond villain's lair,
with banks of ominous computers.
For sheer shameless manipulation,
Lumet and Himmelstein top any
character in their movie.
The filmmakers draw their lines
very clearly: old-time, honest
politicians versus the new breed of
TV politician. They keep their
message pitched at this level, and
we're meant to be shocked when St.
John has his first big speech, telling a
potential candidate that "You've paid
me to make you a new life, a new
image. My job is to get you into of
fice; once there, you can vote your
conscience."
But "Power" is terribly simplistic
both in defining the problem and of
fering a solution. St. John has a:
change of heart near the end of the
movie, when he realizes that the can
didate he's working for is ruthless and
corrupt. St. John goes to an idealistic
young candidate opposing his man
and tells him to "speak your mind,
and maybe you can make a differ
ence."
Sure enough, the idealistic young
candidate goes out and gives a speech
which begins — just like one of Presi
dent Carter or President Reagan's old

speeches — by deriding politicians,
and the voters respond.
Lumet and Himmelstein continu
ally jump from cold cynicism to
breathtaking naivete and back again.
The movie ends with the camera pan
ning over rows of computers and TV
monitors, while "The Stars and
Stripes Forever" swells in the back
ground; Lumet really beats us with
his irony stick in these moments, but
it's a hollow conclusion.
"Power" plays like a compacted
television mini-series, and the
performers tend to keep it on that
level. Gere brings no depth to St.
John's shallowness; he looks great in
his designer suits, and maintains a
high energy level throughout, but nei
ther he nor the script begins to sug
gest why St. John is so driven. Gere is
all surfaces, and he doesn't convey
any kind of thirst for power, any kind
of overarching ambition. St. John is
just a man who does his job very well,
so the relevance of the movie's
ominous title to his character is lost.
Julie Christie, as a reporter and St.
John's ex-wife, is smugly awful, and
Straight gives the most embarrassing,
scenery-chomping performance of
the year (she must have callouses
from all her hand-wringing).
Hackman brings an uncanny
amount of conviction to his role, but
it's so shallowly conceived he's left
flailing for a character in most scenes.
In "Power" (as in his last film,
"The Verdict") Lumet is obsessed
with dimly lit interiors, and the ma
chinations of dark men in dark suits
(darkly lit by cinematographer
Andrzej Bartkowiak). And "Power"
has the same kind of empty-headed,
optimistic ending, which seems to
negate all that went before it.
"Power" is never boring, however,
and compared with "The Verdict,"
it's supercharged. Lumet seems all
fired up to direct something he really
believes in; that he apparently
believes in this script is a rather
distressing measure of his sensibility.
Himmelstein's material doesn't need
a director, it needs an alchemist.

kingmaker with no ethical or emo
tional stake in his clients. St. John
spends as much time in a plane as on
the ground, juggling four different
campaigns in South America, Seattle,
New Mexico and Ohio. In terms of
the plot, this is at least two campaigns
too many, and we spend a lot of time
in that plane with him, listening to the
drum solo in Benny Goodman's

"Sing, Sing, Sing" (St. John plays it
constantly over stereo headphones).
Without the rumba beat in these
transition scenes, the energy level
would drop and the movie would
grind to a halt.
Lumet is all fired up to make an in
dictment of campaign manipulation
with this movie, but nothing he and
screenwriter David Himmelstein
have to say is very fresh or exciting.
In interviews, the filmmakers decry
the buying, selling and packaging of
political candidates, and in "Power"
they unveil every instance of media

manipulation as if it were a sparkling,
newly revealed truth.
Lumet and Himmelstein may be
the only people left in the country
who are shocked by these revelations;
most Americans know our election
system is ridiculous, but no one seems
to care much. This is not the time for
a muckraking indictment of the poli
tical process — not when that process
has just wiped out the last vestiges of
the Nixon era, and put the most
popular president since FDR into of
fice. And this is clearly not the time
for muckraking political movies —

not after the commercial failure of
films like "Blow Out" and "Under
Fire."
None of this is to suggest that
"Power" is a successful indictment of
anything. Of all the entertainment
arts, movies are in the worst position
to be calling the game of packaging
and image-making foul, and "Power"
is so phony it makes the campaign ads
we see the characters cooking up look
naturalistic by comparison.
St. John rushes from one high-tech,
plushly padded office to the next,
looking awesomely neat and

glamorous and beautiful. He beds
gorgeous women and makes loads of
money; for two filmmakers interested
in exposing the corrupt shallowness
of politics, Lumet and Himmelstein
seem suspiciously taken by all the
surface glitz and glitter of St. John's
lifestyle.
They hold up a venerable senator
as their model of a "good"
politician; we can tell he has integrity
because he's the only one who
doesn't work in a high-rise, glass
enclosed office space. The movie's
symbol for honest, sincere govern
ment is an old, leather-bound,
mahagony high-backed chair. E. G.
Marshall (looking fraught with
worry) is cast as the old senator, with
Beatrice Straight as his wife.
J. T. Walsh is the ruthless young
Senate hopeful, and his headquarters
look like a James Bond villain's lair,
with banks of ominous computers.
For sheer shameless manipulation,
Lumet and Himmelstein top any
character in their movie.
The filmmakers draw their lines
very clearly: old-time, honest
politicians versus the new breed of
TV politician. They keep their
message pitched at this level, and
we're meant to be shocked when St.
John has his first big speech, telling a
potential candidate that "You've paid
me to make you a new life, a new
image. My job is to get you into of
fice; once there, you can vote your
conscience."
But "Power" is terribly simplistic
both in defining the problem and of
fering a solution. St. John has a:
change of heart near the end of the
movie, when he realizes that the can
didate he's working for is ruthless and
corrupt. St. John goes to an idealistic
young candidate opposing his man
and tells him to "speak your mind,
and maybe you can make a differ
ence."
Sure enough, the idealistic young
candidate goes out and gives a speech
which begins — just like one of Presi
dent Carter or President Reagan's old

speeches — by deriding politicians,
and the voters respond.
Lumet and Himmelstein continu
ally jump from cold cynicism to
breathtaking naivete and back again.
The movie ends with the camera pan
ning over rows of computers and TV
monitors, while "The Stars and
Stripes Forever" swells in the back
ground; Lumet really beats us with
his irony stick in these moments, but
it's a hollow conclusion.
"Power" plays like a compacted
television mini-series, and the
performers tend to keep it on that
level. Gere brings no depth to St.
John's shallowness; he looks great in
his designer suits, and maintains a
high energy level throughout, but nei
ther he nor the script begins to sug
gest why St. John is so driven. Gere is
all surfaces, and he doesn't convey
any kind of thirst for power, any kind
of overarching ambition. St. John is
just a man who does his job very well,
so the relevance of the movie's
ominous title to his character is lost.
Julie Christie, as a reporter and St.
John's ex-wife, is smugly awful, and
Straight gives the most embarrassing,
scenery-chomping performance of
the year (she must have callouses
from all her hand-wringing).
Hackman brings an uncanny
amount of conviction to his role, but
it's so shallowly conceived he's left
flailing for a character in most scenes.
In "Power" (as in his last film,
"The Verdict") Lumet is obsessed
with dimly lit interiors, and the ma
chinations of dark men in dark suits
(darkly lit by cinematographer
Andrzej Bartkowiak). And "Power"
has the same kind of empty-headed,
optimistic ending, which seems to
negate all that went before it.
"Power" is never boring, however,
and compared with "The Verdict,"
it's supercharged. Lumet seems all
fired up to direct something he really
believes in; that he apparently
believes in this script is a rather
distressing measure of his sensibility.
Himmelstein's material doesn't need
a director, it needs an alchemist.

Gene Hackman has had the dis
tinction of appearing in three of the
worst major American movies of the
last six months: "Target," "Twice in a
Lifetime" and now "Power," which
may be the most entertainingly bad
picture of the lot.
In "Power" Hackman plays
Wilfred Buckley, a media consultant
with a conscience (he only works for
candidates he can believe in) who's
on the slide. In one scene, Buckley
storms off a plane in Santa Fe falling
down drunk, hurling insults at a
former associate and raring to work
on the New Mexico governorship
race.
Later we see him wearing a seer
sucker suit and a stringy bow tie,
looking as if he had just arrived from
up north for the Scopes Monkey
Trial. Hackman brazens his way
through these scenes, but he seems
more lost than anyone else in this
movie, possibly because he's the most
conscientious of the performers gath
ered here. In "Power," director Sid
ney Lumet substitutes high energy for
narrative coherence, and he keeps the
movie jumping along. The actors
keep running (and tripping and fall
ing) to keep up the pace.
The ads for "Power" feature the
line "More seductive than sex . . .
more precious than gold." Not to
worry — there's plenty of money and
sex involved in this "behind the
scenes expose" of media manipula
tion in political campaigns.
