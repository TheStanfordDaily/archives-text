# A.C.T. overplays Coward's comedy
## 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer

Theater opened Noel Coward's
masterpiece of polished wit,
"Private Lives," last week as the
fourth show of its season. While
it avoids the depths of mediocrity
of the first show, "The Majestic
Kid," this production is average at
best. Adequate, lukewarm and
mildly amusing are the repeated
phrases in my program notes, and
this seems surprising for a script
famous for its scintillating
dialogue and sparkling characters.
A.C.T. has made the mistake it
made last month with George Ber
nard Shaw's"You Never Can
Tell," another mannered comedy
requiring elegant lightness of
touch. In both shows the company
has substituted American gags for
British polish.
I am not a snob, but it just
seems inappropriate. Many of the
bits and gags in "Private Lives"
are uproarious without a doubt.
Nevertheless one could find the
same bits and gags in any comedy
or farce.
A.C.T.'s production doesn't
seem to really exploit any of the
hallmarks of Coward's style, which
is a waste. While they have sub
stituted valid alternatives for
Coward's original style, they are
just that: alternatives. It is not
Coward, despite his name on the
program.
What the production is, exactly,
is an American comedy of won
derful comic mugging and posing.
The play revolves around a
divorced couple, Elyot and
Amanda, who have each recently
remarried only to find they are still
passionately in love with each
other.
They run off together, fight,
leave each other and then fall in
love all over again. It is the em
bodiment of silliness, and the cast
plays it as such. Rick Hamilton

and Fredi Olster are clearly veter
aas of comic acting, and milk each
gag, particularly during the second
act, for all its worth.
It is this milking, though, that
seems inappropriate to Coward.
His style works best if the witty
lines are quickly and effortlessly
delivered, for the audience to en
joy if they want (or can) for a mo
ment, and then quickly forget in
anticipation of the next joke.
Hamilton occasionally falls into
the most deadly of acting
mistakes: appearing a little too
smart, a little too self-assured.
Smug, arch people generate little
sympathy on stage, and Hamil
ton's constant grin and wry
shoulder hunching did nothing to
dispel this image.
The one exception to the
"heavy" American feel of the cast
was Nike Doukas in the role of
Elyot's youthful second bride,
Sybil. Doukas not only captures
the entertaining silliness the other
actors do, but she gives Sybil a
lightness and simplicity that
generates a true elegance. She is a
young innocent, and yet she does
not simply play a sympathetic
weakling. Although she is only in a
supporting role and serves mostly
as the functional butt for Elyot's
witty retorts, both the energy and
interest of the show are highest
when Doukas is on stage.
A.C.T.'s production is yet an
other case of the company's at
tempt to broaden audience appeal
by watering down idiosyncratic
style. I thought Coward and Shaw
had enough appeal on their own,
but the recent productions have
shown A.C.T. has little trust in the
entertainment value of wit and
polish on their own.
They have opted instead to
"help" the script with some broad
humor. You will most certainly
laugh during "Private Lives," and
may enjoy your evening at the
theater immensely, but do not
make the mistake of believing it is
the play Coward intended.
