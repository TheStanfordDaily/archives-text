# Exhibit explores architectural art

### LISA LYNCH Editorial staff 
Everything's gone "post" these
days. Post-industrial, post-modern,
Post Raisin Bran ... it seems that
"post" really means, "well now we
understand what just happened in the
art/scientific/political world but we
don't know what this new stuff is
yet." Luckily, an exhibit at the Uni
versity Art Museum in Berkeley does
a great job of grouping together the
"new stuff' in architecture and help
ing to explain it.
The exhibit "The Critical Edge"
was designed by Rutgers University
faculty and has been traveling
throughout the country. It seeks to
aaswer a well-posed question — is
the role of architecture to satisfy and
uplift the public? — through an analy
sis of five recently constructed build
ings.
All of the buildings except one are
given to us in model form. Plans, site
analyses and working drawings are
presented as well. In addition, critical
responses to the buildings are col
lected and displayed on posterboard
— both official responses from ar
chitects and comments from members
of the community the building was
designed for.
The first exhibited building, a
house designed by Frank Gehry in
1978, immediately makes one realize
that we're not dealing with the stan
dard San Francisco townhouse.
Gehry has taken an ordinary house
and, well, architectized it; strange
geometric projections and random in
dustrial materials have shattered the
building's old form and turned it into
a throbbing, amorphous/////!#.
Gehry's creation is exciting, but is
it architecture? And what do the
neighbors think? A group of what I
imagine were Berkeley architecture
instructors were considering Gehry's
sketches as I looked over the model;
one pointed to a sketch done hap
hazardly on a scrap of lined yellow
paper and said, "This is from the se
ries he did while sitting on the toilet."
In a collection of comments from
neighbors, posted below a photo of
the house, one man remarked that
the house was so ugly it was "anti
social."
The Gehry house could be called
expressionistic, I suppose, because of
its sense of spontaneity. By contrast,
Phillip Johnson's AT&T Building,
the most well-known structure in the

exhibit, was painstakingly planned
and executed. Johnson's building has
the trappings of an ordinary
skyscraper — that is, until one notices
the large and ornate cornice at the
top of the building, which makes it
resemble a Chippendale Highboy
that's snuck into a funhouse.
The building, thought by some to
be "grandiose and classic," has in
furiated others; the non-functional
cap is a clear departure from what

people expect from "modern"
skyscrapers.
An interesting part of this exhibit is
the shadow studies that were done of
the building site; one of the efforts to
block construction of Johnson's
design was a claim that its height
would cast unfavorable shadows on
surrounding buildings. I'd never
before seen a computer analyses of
the shadow effects of a building that
hadn't been built yet.
Another well-planned, even more

tongue-in-cheek structure is the Best
products building in Houston, which
was completed in 1975. According to
the exhibit's designers, the Best prod
ucts people have been great patrons
of post-modern architecture, and the
Houston building is an example of a
company that's not afraid to make a
bold statement.
Like the Johnson Building and
unlike the Gehry house, it's largely a
c* rr> r tiro

except that the top of the front facade
is permanently falling down. The ef
fect is so realistic that when the build
ing was unveiled, two policemen
responded to a motorist who called in
to say a building was collapsing.
When the hullabaloo was over, the
policemen bought a couple of
watches at the Best Store. So who
says post-modern design is non
functional?
On a more serious note — sort of
— is Michael Graves' municipal

building for Portland, Ore. The
design is fairly deco, executed in pink,
green and gray — and it's been
variously interpeted as a grand public
monument and a public joke at the
expense of the Portlandians.
It's unquestionably a building with
character, however, and an alterna
tive to the featurelessness charac
terizing so many municipal buildings.
The public response to this building
has been increasingly favorable; it is,
after all, not as "far out" as some of
the other buildings here, but rather
like someone's eccentric old aunt who
suddenly finds her angora sweaters
are in fashion again.
Another offspring of the eccentric
family of architecture is the Plaza
D'ltalia, a plaza area in New Orleans
which combines a mishmash of classi
cal architectural details in a slightly
perverse tangle of archways. The ef
fect is humorous, airy and Italian in
the manner of a tacky Italian restau
rant. The architectural firm of Perez
and Moore was hired to create an
appropriate park for an "ethnic" Ital
ian community, as part of a down
town renovation.
The project was generally well
received — unfortunately the rest of
the area was never really fixed up,
and the plaza was not well cared for.
Its condition deteriorated rapidly,
and its designers were accused of de
signing a facility more for initial ef
fect than for durability.
The last exhibit, "House 2," de
signed by Eisenman, again brings up
the issue of effect versus function.
The house is structurally sound, but
unfortunately not a very comfortable
place to live. "Aesthetic" considera
tions have led to the placing of sup
port columns through the center of
the dining room table, too-low
doorframes, a combination stair
case/upside-down staircase that the
house's owner is continually bumping
his head against. "House" is a pretty
place to visit, but not worth living in.
If a building is uninhabitable, how
can it possibly be well-designed?
Alter considering the six buildings
in "The Critical Edge," I didn't have
any great revelations as to where ar
chitecture is going, but I had a lot to
think about. Besides, if anyone could
draw any conclusions about what's
going on, they'd have to drop the
"post" from post-modern architec
ture and give it a real name. And
that's not an easy thing to do.

going on, they'd have to drop the
"post" from post-modern architec
ture and give it a real name. And
that's not an easy thing to do.

Everything's gone "post" these
days. Post-industrial, post-modern,
Post Raisin Bran ... it seems that
"post" really means, "well now we
understand what just happened in the
art/scientific/political world but we
don't know what this new stuff is
yet." Luckily, an exhibit at the Uni
versity Art Museum in Berkeley does
a great job of grouping together the
"new stuff' in architecture and help
ing to explain it.
The exhibit "The Critical Edge"
was designed by Rutgers University
faculty and has been traveling
throughout the country. It seeks to
aaswer a well-posed question — is
the role of architecture to satisfy and
uplift the public? — through an analy
sis of five recently constructed build
ings.
All of the buildings except one are
given to us in model form. Plans, site
analyses and working drawings are
presented as well. In addition, critical
responses to the buildings are col
lected and displayed on posterboard
— both official responses from ar
chitects and comments from members
of the community the building was
designed for.
The first exhibited building, a
house designed by Frank Gehry in
1978, immediately makes one realize
that we're not dealing with the stan
dard San Francisco townhouse.
Gehry has taken an ordinary house
and, well, architectized it; strange
geometric projections and random in
dustrial materials have shattered the
building's old form and turned it into
a throbbing, amorphous/////!#.
Gehry's creation is exciting, but is
it architecture? And what do the
neighbors think? A group of what I
imagine were Berkeley architecture
instructors were considering Gehry's
sketches as I looked over the model;
one pointed to a sketch done hap
hazardly on a scrap of lined yellow
paper and said, "This is from the se
ries he did while sitting on the toilet."
In a collection of comments from
neighbors, posted below a photo of
the house, one man remarked that
the house was so ugly it was "anti
social."
The Gehry house could be called
expressionistic, I suppose, because of
its sense of spontaneity. By contrast,
Phillip Johnson's AT&T Building,
the most well-known structure in the

exhibit, was painstakingly planned
and executed. Johnson's building has
the trappings of an ordinary
skyscraper — that is, until one notices
the large and ornate cornice at the
top of the building, which makes it
resemble a Chippendale Highboy
that's snuck into a funhouse.
The building, thought by some to
be "grandiose and classic," has in
furiated others; the non-functional
cap is a clear departure from what

people expect from "modern"
skyscrapers.
An interesting part of this exhibit is
the shadow studies that were done of
the building site; one of the efforts to
block construction of Johnson's
design was a claim that its height
would cast unfavorable shadows on
surrounding buildings. I'd never
before seen a computer analyses of
the shadow effects of a building that
hadn't been built yet.
Another well-planned, even more

tongue-in-cheek structure is the Best
products building in Houston, which
was completed in 1975. According to
the exhibit's designers, the Best prod
ucts people have been great patrons
of post-modern architecture, and the
Houston building is an example of a
company that's not afraid to make a
bold statement.
Like the Johnson Building and
unlike the Gehry house, it's largely a
c* rr> r tiro

except that the top of the front facade
is permanently falling down. The ef
fect is so realistic that when the build
ing was unveiled, two policemen
responded to a motorist who called in
to say a building was collapsing.
When the hullabaloo was over, the
policemen bought a couple of
watches at the Best Store. So who
says post-modern design is non
functional?
On a more serious note — sort of
— is Michael Graves' municipal

building for Portland, Ore. The
design is fairly deco, executed in pink,
green and gray — and it's been
variously interpeted as a grand public
monument and a public joke at the
expense of the Portlandians.
It's unquestionably a building with
character, however, and an alterna
tive to the featurelessness charac
terizing so many municipal buildings.
The public response to this building
has been increasingly favorable; it is,
after all, not as "far out" as some of
the other buildings here, but rather
like someone's eccentric old aunt who
suddenly finds her angora sweaters
are in fashion again.
Another offspring of the eccentric
family of architecture is the Plaza
D'ltalia, a plaza area in New Orleans
which combines a mishmash of classi
cal architectural details in a slightly
perverse tangle of archways. The ef
fect is humorous, airy and Italian in
the manner of a tacky Italian restau
rant. The architectural firm of Perez
and Moore was hired to create an
appropriate park for an "ethnic" Ital
ian community, as part of a down
town renovation.
The project was generally well
received — unfortunately the rest of
the area was never really fixed up,
and the plaza was not well cared for.
Its condition deteriorated rapidly,
and its designers were accused of de
signing a facility more for initial ef
fect than for durability.
The last exhibit, "House 2," de
signed by Eisenman, again brings up
the issue of effect versus function.
The house is structurally sound, but
unfortunately not a very comfortable
place to live. "Aesthetic" considera
tions have led to the placing of sup
port columns through the center of
the dining room table, too-low
doorframes, a combination stair
case/upside-down staircase that the
house's owner is continually bumping
his head against. "House" is a pretty
place to visit, but not worth living in.
If a building is uninhabitable, how
can it possibly be well-designed?
Alter considering the six buildings
in "The Critical Edge," I didn't have
any great revelations as to where ar
chitecture is going, but I had a lot to
think about. Besides, if anyone could
draw any conclusions about what's
going on, they'd have to drop the
"post" from post-modern architec
