The Costello Show (Elvis Costello) —
"King of America"
ConradConradConrad
Sooner or later we knew he would
do it, and here it is: a hillbilly album.
Like everyone else, Elvis has turned
to American roots and apparently
found country music appealing. The
music is distinctly country — the At
tractions, Elvis' regular band, are
replaced on all but one track by
country and rock musicians, including

guru guitarist James Burton, who
slithers through some rather subdued
contributions.
At times Burton also tries rock
abilly. But through it all you've got
Elvis' voice. It's his typical crooning,
gruff, Brit-pop vocal style that refuses
to sound right with anything else but
his own Costello-stylized pop. This
tells you several things:
A)That Elvis can't write great
country music, only pretty good
country music.
B)That Elvis can still be pretty bit
ter about everything.

C)That his real name is Matthew
Declan Patrick Aloysius "Grinnin"'
Macmanus, a.k.a. Little Hands of
Concrete.
D)That Elvis is capable of doing an
album without at least one great song.
E)That everyone in the record in
dustry thinks all they've got to do is
put "America" in the title of an al
bum and it will sell.
F)That Elvis is the only songwriter
capable of putting 15 country (with
two rockabilly) songs on one LP, and
stupid enough to do it.
Mannheim Steamroller — "Saving the
Wildlife"
MichaelMichaelMichaelWilding
The first gentle rains tantalize the
parched, cracked surface of
America's music palate; and
thousands of teenage earthworms
poke their cute little noses out of the
earth, only to drown three days later
and decompose softly throughout
campus, getting run over by college
students on bikes.
And where are all those college
students going? To their local record
meccas, of course, because they're
proto-yuppies and they're all itchin'
for that crazy New Age Beat.
The people in Mannheim Steam
roller are the Prime Ministers of
Pretentious Music. Repeated
Windham Hill attacks on American
Gramophone (the Steamroller's
label) have proved unsuccessful in re
ducing the group's predominance in
the genre. There's just no stoppin'
lead-songwriter-player Chip Davis
and the gang.

Actually, there is one thing stop
ping them: "Saving the Wildlife" is
the soundtrack to a PBS special on
endangered species, and therefore
the music, as required by Interna
tional Record Company Civil Code
43(b), Sec. 8A ("Soundtracks"),
must be boring and go nowhere.
Melodies are few and far between
compared to Mannheim's mondo-rad
"Fresh Aire" series.
Nevertheless, the Steamers manage
to control their soundtrack much bet
ter than most groups could, and
there's enough neat rhythms, cool
sound effects and ahhhhh production
to keep fans satisfied until the release
of Fresh Aire VI, which looms im
minently in the near future, promis
ing more of the top-quality neoclassi
cal jazz-o-rock instrumentals that
have earned Mannheim such critical
acclaim and big bucks so far.
Jackson Browne — "Lives in the Bal
ance"
Richardßichardkichard
Since "pop" quizzes are prohibited
during Dead Week, we thought we'd
slip this in beforehand to help shar
pen your skulls and warm you up for
finals.
T/F Jackson Browne has brown
eyes.
T/F Browne should have looked for
the piano he used to compose the
songs on "The Pretender" and
" Running on Empty."
T/F Dance clubs worldwide will
soon be playing the extended dance
remix of "For America" to throngs of
boppin' teenagers.
T/F The way the album cover

opens on the left, rather than on the
right, is infuriating.
T/F Some songs here are fine, but
none compare to vintage JB.
T/F Jackson Browne's real name is
Dee Snider, but he changed it in the
early '70s to avoid future legal
hassles.
T/F Browne's vocal style and har
monies are still superb.
T/F Browne's mother, a well
known Studio City psychic, recently
predicted that her son would lead a
coup d'etat of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission in 1989.

T/F Browne currently spends more
time rehearsing with wife Daryl Han
nah than rehearsing with his band.
T/F "Lives in the Balance" is better
than The Beatles' " Abbey Road."
T/F "Lives in the Balance" is better
than Animotion's "Strange Behav
ior."
T/F Browne's style and execution
are basically unchanged since his
peak in the late '70s; but by failing to
keep "up" with today's style his ap
proach's effectiveness has dwindled.
T/F At least it's better than
"Lawyers in Love."

Macmanus, a.k.a. Little Hands of
Concrete.
D)That Elvis is capable of doing an
album without at least one great song.
E)That everyone in the record in
dustry thinks all they've got to do is
put "America" in the title of an al
bum and it will sell.
F)That Elvis is the only songwriter
capable of putting 15 country (with
two rockabilly) songs on one LP, and

Mannheim Steamroller — "Saving the
Wildlife"
MichaelMichaelMichaelWilding
The first gentle rains tantalize the
parched, cracked surface of
America's music palate; and
thousands of teenage earthworms
poke their cute little noses out of the
earth, only to drown three days later
and decompose softly throughout
campus, getting run over by college
students on bikes.
And where are all those college
students going? To their local record
meccas, of course, because they're
proto-yuppies and they're all itchin'
for that crazy New Age Beat.
The people in Mannheim Steam
roller are the Prime Ministers of
Pretentious Music. Repeated
Windham Hill attacks on American
Gramophone (the Steamroller's
label) have proved unsuccessful in re
ducing the group's predominance in
the genre. There's just no stoppin'
lead-songwriter-player Chip Davis
and the gang.

Actually, there is one thing stop
ping them: "Saving the Wildlife" is
the soundtrack to a PBS special on
endangered species, and therefore
the music, as required by Interna
tional Record Company Civil Code
43(b), Sec. 8A ("Soundtracks"),
must be boring and go nowhere.
Melodies are few and far between
compared to Mannheim's mondo-rad
"Fresh Aire" series.
Nevertheless, the Steamers manage
to control their soundtrack much bet
ter than most groups could, and
there's enough neat rhythms, cool
sound effects and ahhhhh production
to keep fans satisfied until the release
of Fresh Aire VI, which looms im
minently in the near future, promis
ing more of the top-quality neoclassi
cal jazz-o-rock instrumentals that
have earned Mannheim such critical
acclaim and big bucks so far.
Jackson Browne — "Lives in the Bal
ance"
Richardßichardkichard
Since "pop" quizzes are prohibited
during Dead Week, we thought we'd
slip this in beforehand to help shar
pen your skulls and warm you up for
finals.
T/F Jackson Browne has brown
eyes.
T/F Browne should have looked for
the piano he used to compose the
songs on "The Pretender" and
" Running on Empty."
T/F Dance clubs worldwide will
soon be playing the extended dance
remix of "For America" to throngs of
boppin' teenagers.
T/F The way the album cover

opens on the left, rather than on the
right, is infuriating.
T/F Some songs here are fine, but
none compare to vintage JB.
T/F Jackson Browne's real name is
Dee Snider, but he changed it in the
early '70s to avoid future legal
hassles.
T/F Browne's vocal style and har
monies are still superb.
T/F Browne's mother, a well
known Studio City psychic, recently
predicted that her son would lead a
coup d'etat of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission in 1989.

T/F Browne currently spends more
time rehearsing with wife Daryl Han
nah than rehearsing with his band.
T/F "Lives in the Balance" is better
than The Beatles' " Abbey Road."
T/F "Lives in the Balance" is better
than Animotion's "Strange Behav
ior."
T/F Browne's style and execution
are basically unchanged since his
peak in the late '70s; but by failing to
keep "up" with today's style his ap
proach's effectiveness has dwindled.
T/F At least it's better than
"Lawyers in Love."


Ratings this week are in Elizabeth
Taylor's husbands.
The Costello Show (Elvis Costello) —
"King of America"
ConradConradConrad
Sooner or later we knew he would
do it, and here it is: a hillbilly album.
Like everyone else, Elvis has turned
to American roots and apparently
found country music appealing. The
music is distinctly country — the At
tractions, Elvis' regular band, are
replaced on all but one track by
country and rock musicians, including

guru guitarist James Burton, who
slithers through some rather subdued
contributions.
At times Burton also tries rock
abilly. But through it all you've got
Elvis' voice. It's his typical crooning,
gruff, Brit-pop vocal style that refuses
to sound right with anything else but
his own Costello-stylized pop. This
tells you several things:
A)That Elvis can't write great
country music, only pretty good
country music.
B)That Elvis can still be pretty bit
ter about everything.

C)That his real name is Matthew
Declan Patrick Aloysius "Grinnin"'
Macmanus, a.k.a. Little Hands of
Concrete.
D)That Elvis is capable of doing an
album without at least one great song.
E)That everyone in the record in
dustry thinks all they've got to do is
put "America" in the title of an al
bum and it will sell.
F)That Elvis is the only songwriter
