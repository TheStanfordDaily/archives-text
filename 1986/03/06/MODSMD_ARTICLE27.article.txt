# Jazz great Blakey keeps youthful beat
## 
### CHRIS HAQQ 
If you have ever felt the urge to see
piano strings oscillate like a centipede
with epilepsy, hear a trumpeter play
chords while speaking through his
horn, or feel the beat of a drummer
who plays the sides, supports and car
rying cases of his drums as well as
standard top surface, Art Blakey and
the Jazz Messengers are the band to
see.
Saturday night at San Francisco's
Great American Music Hall, the Jazz
Messengers delighted a sellout crowd
with dazzling instrumental technique,
and an energetic collection of charts.
Blakey has been responsible for
bringing together many of the finest
young jazz artists into a band that en
courages innovation and enthusiasm
in music. Alumni of Blakey's band in

clude saxophonists Wayne Shorter,
Branford Marsalis, and trumpeters
Wynton Marsalis and Clifford Brown.
When the Marsalis brothers
decided to move onto their own
recording projects, two even younger
musical talents from the New Orleans
jazz scene joined the group. The new
trumpeter, Terence Blanchard, is
already giving Wynton Marsalis hot
competition in critic and reader polls
aimed at selecting the top trumpet
player in the jazz world.
Like all of the musicians in
Blakey's group, Blanchard really
takes his horn to the outer limits. He
can play delicately orchestrated
phrases at speeds approaching 10
notes-per-second, that is, according to
the stopwatch on my digital
wristwatch.

High speed control was not the
only delight Blanchard offered. In ad
dition to exploring traditional
melodic jazz themes, jazz fans in at
tendance Saturday heard a thorough
exploration of the types of sound that
can be produced by the trumpet. I
heard many sounds come out of the
trumpet that I would have been
tempted to believe were electroni
cally synthesized, had I not seen the
musician create his magic in person.
Both Harrison and Miller show
promise as composers. Harrison
wrote a vibrant and strident chart
called "Controversy," which gave the
rhythm section a chance to juggle the
beat and show their stuff. The chart
ends appropriately in a three-way
tenor sax, alto sax and trumpet battle
and individual phrases coalesce into
cacaphony.

The old man himself, Blakey, is of
course one of the all-time jazz treats.
Blakey's ecstatic grin and excited
eyes turn sequentially to everyone in
his field of vision.
He is a drummer who loves to see
people respond to the groovy
rhythms he pounds out by bopping
their heads back and forth, or just
shuffling their feet. Everyone in the
Music Hall was getting into his beat
— even a three-year old who
managed to escape from his mother
long enough to start a dance in front
of the stage. If you enjoy jazz, by all
means see Blakey and the Jazz Mes
sengers the next time they play in the
Bay Area. If you can't wait, the group
that played Saturday has a Grammy
Award-winning album out called
"New York Scene."
