If Aristotle played point guard (such Western
Culture blasphemy), he would have been called
something like the sharpshooting savant" or
simply the the Big A. Such is the nature of sports
Real names never stand pat.
Aristotle would have been joined by other West
ern Culture notables such as "Pee-Wee Werther"
(baseball shortstop), Don "Take Charge" Quixote
(basketball power forward), Cardinal "Running
Rebel" Richelieu (football fullback) and "Ain't
that a shame" Abelard (checkers and advanced sit
ting).
Indeed, ever since the first "melodious" sounds
of Gregorian chants, sports has played havoc with
names.

Individual nicknames for players oftentimes
characterize, or at very least, portray a certain style
or pattern in the sport itself.
Take professional golf, for instance. The connec
tion between the wild kingdom of animals and gol
fers seems tenuous at best. Yet, a certain fetish
exists for nicknaming them after nature's critters.
Jack Nicklaus goes by the grand title of "The
Golden Bear" while Greg Norman and Craig Stad
ler assume the names "The Shark" and"The
Walrus," respectively.
Even "Fuzzy" Zoeller has been seemingly named
after rabbit fur. Why this trend? I simply do not
know. Perhaps Marlon Perkins is a scratch golfer.
Professional basketball nicknames make more
sense, for they elegantly and descriptively depict the
game.
For starters, you have the old favorites — Dr. J
(Julius Erving), the Iceman (George Gervin) and
Magic (Earvin Johnson). Less familiar, but equally
provoking names remain as well. How about Utah's
Karl "The Mailman" Malone, aptly named because
"he always delivers."
Then there's former New York Knickerbocker
Marvin "The Human Eraser" Webster and
Chicago's Artis "The A-Train" Gilmore. My all
time favorite, though, is former Houston Rocket
Billy "The Whopper" Paultz, who arguably could
have been the worst NBA player in history.
Some NBA players have been a little too swept
up in the nickname craze, namely New Jersey's
Darryl Dawkins. A self-proclaimed resident of
"Lovetron," this economy-sized E.T. of the NBA
has dubbed himself "Chocolate Thunder."
One NBA player, formerly named Lloyd Free,
enjoyed his nickname of "World" so much that he
made it official. His real name is now World B.
Free. Teammates and friends have since nicknamed
him "Lloyd."

Other creative aliases are
Portland's Jerome "Mercy, Mercy"
Kersey and Clyde "The Glide" Drex
ler, Atlanta's Dominique "the
Human Highlight Film" Wilkins,
Houston's Akeem "The Dream"
Olajuwon and Lewis "Black Magic"
Lloyd, accompanied finally by
Philadephia's Charles "Round
Mound of Rebound" Barkley.
Pro football has had its fair share of
fun with nomenclature. Witness
Chicago's Walter "Sweetness"
Payton and the increasingly worn
William "The Refrigerator" Perry.
Other individual beauties answer
to the tune of Kenny "The Snake"
Stabler of Oakland fame, Randy
"Manster" White from Dallas and
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson from
New Orleans.
In general though, football's best
nicknames are derived from units, es
pecially defensive ones.
The proud Minnesota Vikings, per
haps the finest football organization
in pro-football history, called their
dominating defense of the '70s "The
Purple People Eaters."

"Doomsday Defense," "Fearsome
Foursome," "The Steel Curtain,"
"The Orange Crush," "The No-
Name Defense" and"The New York
Sack Exchange" have been other de
fensive callings in the past and pres
ent.
These aside, the greatest nickname
was provided by New Orleans Saints
fans, who referred to their inept team
as "the Ain'ts"
If it weren't for bowling, baseball
would rent the nickname cellar. Sure,
and "Jolting" Joe DiMaggio, but
who's to say that these are any better
than bowling's Earl "The Pearl" An
thony or Dick "Three-Fingered"
Weber?
I think I'd call it a draw.
Finally, we come to the two sports
— boxing and wrestling — that
glorify and revolutionize nicknames. I
give you boxing's Marvelous Marvin
Hagler, Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini,
Thomas "Hit-Man" Hearns, James
"Quick" Tillis, John "The Beast"
Mugabi and Bonecrusher Smith, who
apparently goes by no other name.
Mom, Dad, I want you to meet my
date Bonecrusher. . .. Thanks, but no
thanks.
Wrestling follows a similar, but
more outrageous theme. Announcers

will bellow out names like King Kong
Bundy, Rowdy Roddy Piper, The
Shiek, Playboy Buddy Rose, Hulk
Hogan, Sergeant Slaughter and
Andre the Giant.
The wrestling nickname hoopla has
hit the collegiate level, most notably
illustrated by former Cardinal
wrestler Michael "Longinus" Perez.
It's difficult to say which sport can
claim the best of nicknames, though
strong cases can be made for basket
ball, wrestling and boxing. As strange
as it may sound, I would like to honor
bobsledding and luge.
There are no true nicknames that
I'm aware of. However, there is an in
teresting phenomenon that occurs at
the beginning of every race that
merits special recognition and hope
fully someday a collective nickname.
That is, as the luge runners and
bobsledders shove off, the bystanders
let out this strange, neonatal wail that
sounds like a newborn attempting to
vocalize.
Truly, it's the most distinctive
cheer I've heard in sports, and for
that reason, I like to pay homage to
these two unheralded sports, who
judging by their sideline sounds, most
likely have the most creative
nicknames in sports.
