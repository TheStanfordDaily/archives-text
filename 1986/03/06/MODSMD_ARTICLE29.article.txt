If Aristotle played point guard (such Western
Culture blasphemy), he would have been called
something like the sharpshooting savant" or
simply the the Big A. Such is the nature of sports
Real names never stand pat.
Aristotle would have been joined by other West
ern Culture notables such as "Pee-Wee Werther"
(baseball shortstop), Don "Take Charge" Quixote
(basketball power forward), Cardinal "Running
Rebel" Richelieu (football fullback) and "Ain't
that a shame" Abelard (checkers and advanced sit
ting).
Indeed, ever since the first "melodious" sounds
of Gregorian chants, sports has played havoc with
names.

Individual nicknames for players oftentimes
characterize, or at very least, portray a certain style
or pattern in the sport itself.
Take professional golf, for instance. The connec
tion between the wild kingdom of animals and gol
fers seems tenuous at best. Yet, a certain fetish
exists for nicknaming them after nature's critters.
Jack Nicklaus goes by the grand title of "The
Golden Bear" while Greg Norman and Craig Stad
ler assume the names "The Shark" and"The
Walrus," respectively.
Even "Fuzzy" Zoeller has been seemingly named
after rabbit fur. Why this trend? I simply do not
know. Perhaps Marlon Perkins is a scratch golfer.
Professional basketball nicknames make more
sense, for they elegantly and descriptively depict the
game.
For starters, you have the old favorites â€” Dr. J
(Julius Erving), the Iceman (George Gervin) and
Magic (Earvin Johnson). Less familiar, but equally
provoking names remain as well. How about Utah's
Karl "The Mailman" Malone, aptly named because
"he always delivers."
Then there's former New York Knickerbocker
Marvin "The Human Eraser" Webster and
Chicago's Artis "The A-Train" Gilmore. My all
time favorite, though, is former Houston Rocket
Billy "The Whopper" Paultz, who arguably could
have been the worst NBA player in history.
Some NBA players have been a little too swept
up in the nickname craze, namely New Jersey's
Darryl Dawkins. A self-proclaimed resident of
"Lovetron," this economy-sized E.T. of the NBA
has dubbed himself "Chocolate Thunder."
One NBA player, formerly named Lloyd Free,
enjoyed his nickname of "World" so much that he
made it official. His real name is now World B.
Free. Teammates and friends have since nicknamed
him "Lloyd."
