# Computer's MacSick? Visit the Mac Doctors

### VLADINA HESS Staff writer 
When Stanford students Dave Zampino,
Ted Shen and Alan Liu advertise brain sur
gery for $173, they don't mean they're going
to fiddle with your gray matter. They want to
tinker with your Macintosh.

Feature

The three student entrepreneurs — Zam
pino and Shen are juniors, and Liu is a senior
— started their own company, Mac Doctor
Electronics, last fall. The firm's main busi
ness is upgrading and expanding the Mac's

memory from 128K to 512 K.
The company started last spring when
Zampino began performing upgrades out of
his room on campus. Later on, Zampino said
that he thought he could create a part-time
summer job for himself by upgrading Macs.
The company's start-up capital was not
much: $400 and Zampino's old broken
down car. He began by distributing a few
fliers to Mac user groups in the area, and he
received an overwhelming response. He
soon realized that his part-time job would
have to become a full-time commitment.
"There was a lot of money to be made,"
Zampino said, and by the end of the
summer he had enough money to buy
an office in Palo Alto and pay for na
tional advertising.
Last fall Zampino took on partner
Liu; Shen joined this quarter. Zam
pino said his goal is for Mac Doctor to
become a national business. Conse
quently, the firm has placed ad
vertisements in national magazines
such as Mac World.
Mac Doctor's philosophy is differ
ent from other companies', according
to Zampino. He claims that his com
pany offers what customers want: a
reasonable price, top-quality service
and information explaining the
"brain surgery" upgrades.
Their service, according to Liu, dif
fers from Apple's in that Apple
replaces a major part of the com
puter's memory system to increase
the computer's memory capability,
while Mac Doctor mainly works with
existing materials already in the com
puter. "This makes Apple's prices
considerably higher than ours," Liu
said.
According to Liu, what Mac Doctor
does is make the computer's logic
board — the "brain" of the computer
— expandable. The upgrade has been
organized into an assembly line for
mat so that they can upgrade approxi
mately four boards in eight hours,
Shen explained.
Mac Doctor has been successful be
cause its prices are much cheaper
than those quoted by other compan
ies, Liu said. "We offer the fairest
prices for the work we do."
Mac Doctor also keeps its costs
down by keeping things simple and
basic.

"We do everything ourselves — the
l,n<Tr «dino the advertising and the art
work,'' Shen explained. The three
entrepreneurs also find other ways to
keep costs down. For example, there
is no fancy furniture in their office —
it's all second-hand.
Mac Doctor has also cut costs on
advertising. Their advertisements are
not big, glossy, full-page color
pictures with catchy phrases and
logos, but small black and white ad
boxes which explain to the customer
exactly what kind of service they pro
vide, Zampino said.
According to Zampino, the firm's
competitors do not like such honesty
in advertising. "[Our advertisements]
lay out the facts," he said, adding that
their ads have been so successful that
competitors have been snatching
phrases from them.
Most of their customers are from
outside of the area, Shen said. Cus
tomers mail their logic boards to
Mac Doctor's office from places as far
away as Alaska, Canada, France and
Germany. Only 10 to 15 percent of
the customers are local, and very few
have been Stanford students.
Running such a business while
being full-time students isn't easy,
Shen commented. "We've found we
must discipline ourselves and make
sacrifices," he said.
Liu noted that "running a business
teaches you things you'd never learn
in a classroom."
Zampino added that they are
learning engineering from a different
perspective.
And while all three student
entrepreneurs emphasized that the
business has taught them a lot, it has
also brought them something besides
knowledge: more than enough pocket
money.

have to become a full-time commitment.
"There was a lot of money to be made,"
Zampino said, and by the end of the
summer he had enough money to buy
an office in Palo Alto and pay for na
tional advertising.
Last fall Zampino took on partner
Liu; Shen joined this quarter. Zam
pino said his goal is for Mac Doctor to
become a national business. Conse
quently, the firm has placed ad
vertisements in national magazines
such as Mac World.
Mac Doctor's philosophy is differ
ent from other companies', according
to Zampino. He claims that his com
pany offers what customers want: a
reasonable price, top-quality service
and information explaining the
"brain surgery" upgrades.
Their service, according to Liu, dif
fers from Apple's in that Apple
replaces a major part of the com
puter's memory system to increase
the computer's memory capability,
while Mac Doctor mainly works with
existing materials already in the com
puter. "This makes Apple's prices
considerably higher than ours," Liu
said.
According to Liu, what Mac Doctor
does is make the computer's logic
board — the "brain" of the computer
— expandable. The upgrade has been
organized into an assembly line for
mat so that they can upgrade approxi
mately four boards in eight hours,
Shen explained.
Mac Doctor has been successful be
cause its prices are much cheaper
than those quoted by other compan
ies, Liu said. "We offer the fairest
prices for the work we do."
Mac Doctor also keeps its costs
down by keeping things simple and
basic.

"We do everything ourselves — the
l,n<Tr «dino the advertising and the art
work,'' Shen explained. The three
entrepreneurs also find other ways to
keep costs down. For example, there
is no fancy furniture in their office —
it's all second-hand.
Mac Doctor has also cut costs on
advertising. Their advertisements are
not big, glossy, full-page color
pictures with catchy phrases and
logos, but small black and white ad
boxes which explain to the customer
exactly what kind of service they pro
vide, Zampino said.
According to Zampino, the firm's
competitors do not like such honesty
in advertising. "[Our advertisements]
lay out the facts," he said, adding that
their ads have been so successful that
competitors have been snatching
phrases from them.
Most of their customers are from
outside of the area, Shen said. Cus
tomers mail their logic boards to
Mac Doctor's office from places as far
away as Alaska, Canada, France and
Germany. Only 10 to 15 percent of
the customers are local, and very few
have been Stanford students.
Running such a business while
being full-time students isn't easy,
Shen commented. "We've found we
must discipline ourselves and make
sacrifices," he said.
Liu noted that "running a business
teaches you things you'd never learn
in a classroom."
Zampino added that they are
learning engineering from a different
perspective.
And while all three student
entrepreneurs emphasized that the
business has taught them a lot, it has
also brought them something besides
knowledge: more than enough pocket
money.
