# Stanford beats Cal in twilight
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
The match was called because of darkness with two
doubles matches still to be completed. But by that time,
the sun had already set on California's upset hopes, as the
No. 2-ranked Stanford women's tennis team held on for a
5-2 victory over the pesky No. 7 Bears yesterday at the
Varsity Courts.
The Cardinal remained unbeaten, moving its season
record to seven wins and no losses and its Pac-West con
ference mark to 4-0. The Bears, playing without their
tendinitis-hobbled No. 1 singles player, Heather Ettus,
dropped to 7-3 on the season.
As yesterday's match began, the afternoon sun was
beating down on the courts, and the Cardinal was beating
up on Cal. In No. 1 singles, Stanford junior Patty Fendick,
ranked fourth in the collegiate ranks, dismantled fresh
man Karen Shin 6-0, 6-3, making the nation's No. 8
player look as if she had got lost on her way to a juniors
tournament.
Cardinal freshman Eleni Rossides had a similarly easy
time at No. 2 singles, whipping the Bears' Linda Oechsle
6-2, 6-4, while at No. 6 singles, sophomore Kay Tittle
continued her impressive play with a 6-1, 7-5 defeat of
Cal's Mary Margaret Torres.
The remaining three singles matches, however, were
considerably rougher. In No. 3 singles, the Bears' Jennifer
Prah patiently hit lob after lob against Cardinal freshman
Marianne Werdel s ground-stroke rockets. Werdel, slightly
hampered by tendinitis in her left ankle, dropped the first
set 4-6, dominated the second set 6-2 and finally suc
cumbed to the tenacious Prah, 4-6, in a hard-fought third
set.
Nothing could be finer than the play of Cal freshman
Alissa Finerman, who came out strong in No. 4 singles
and handed junior Leigh Anne Eldredge her first singles
defeat of the collegiate season, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
It looked as if the two teams would begin doubles play
knotted at three matches each. In the No. 5 singles match,
another Cal freshman, Sharon Fletcher, had Stanford
junior Stephanie Savides on the ropes. Savides won the
first set 7-5, but Fletcher took the second 6-3 and led 6-5
in the third. Savides battled back gamely, though, grab
bing the next game and the tiebreaker to capture the
match.
Doubles play opened with the Cardinal holding a 4-2
lead in the match. That lead must have been a little too
comfortable, because the Stanford doubles teams came
out playing like zombies. In No. 1 doubles Cal freshmen
Shin and Finerman thumped the sleepwalking team of
Fendick and Eldredge 6-3 in the opening set. Meanwhile,
in the No. 2 match, Savides and sophomore Cari Hagey
could do no right in a 1-6 first set fiasco against Prah and
Fletcher.
Tittle and Werdel, however, provided some hope,
clawing for a 6-4 first set victory over the Bears' Oechsle
and Caroline Yao in No. 3 doubles. The Cardinal duo
went on to nab the tense second set 7-6 and ice the match
victory for Stanford.
At about the same time, the other two Cardinal doubles
teams awoke from their slumbers. Fendick and Eldredge
romped to a 6-1 win in the second set, and Hagey and
Savides evened the No. 2 match with a 6-3 second set win.
Both matches progressed into exciting third sets, with
Fendick and Eldredge forging a 5-4 lead over Shin and
Finerman, and Hagey and Savides hanging in at 4-5
against Fletcher and Prah.
