# Card may help Cal tourney hopes
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
Tonight in Seattle's Hec Ed
mundson Pavilion, the Stanford
men's basketball team will set out to
do something seemingly antithetical
to any group of men wearing the
Cardinal and White — it will attempt
to help the fortunes of the California
basketball team.
Not that the Cardinal's main
motive isn't selfish — the team is
definitely in Washington to try to
finish with its first winning record in
the conference since 1966.
But the irony comes in that a Stan
ford victory over Washington
combined with a Cal win at Washing
ton State would give the Bears a
chance to face the Huskies on Satur
day for second place in the Pac-10
and in all likelihood a berth in the
NCAA tournament.
Washington is currently in second
place in the conference at 12-4, 18-
10 overall, \ x /i games behind first
place Arizona. The Huskies' hopes for
a share of the title rest on sweeping
Stanford and Cal this weekend, while
Arizona, which has clinched at least a
tie, loses to Arizona State. Arizona
already owns the Pac-10's automatic
berth in the NCAA by virtue of
having beaten Washington twice this
season.
Cal is in third place at 10-6, 18-8
overall, two games behind Washing
ton. A Cal sweep up north combined
with a Stanford victory tonight would
tie the Bears with the Huskies for
second, but Cal will have beaten
Washington twice this season. Then
again, the NCAA may take three
Pac-10 teams instead of two.
Stanford, however, will most likely
not have to worry about postseason
tournaments for the 44th straight
year. Stanford went to the NCAA
and won it in 1942, but since then has
either been listening on the radio or
watching on television.
At 8-8 in the conference and 14-14
overall, Stanford is tied for fourth
place in the Pac-10 with Oregon State
and UCLA. But as Coach Tom Davis
noted, the Cardinal could be doing
the climbing this weekend.
"We've got a chance," Davis said,
"to finish high in this league with a
couple of wins. We could finish as
high as third. If Cal loses two, and
UCLA and Oregon State lose at least

one, who finishes tied with Cal for
third? We do. No one's written that."
As for helping the Bears, Davis
said it wasn't even a thought. "We're
trying to do it for ourselves. If it helps
Cal, terrific. I think our kids want it
for other reasons," he said. "We've
got to win for ourselves."
The Huskies seemingly have the
motivation to do well tonight with an
NCAA spot on the line, and the
Cardinal won't be holding its breath
when the pairings are announced.
"You always worry," Davis said,
"about that (exclusion from the
tournament) happening. That's the
way coaches think — look for the
worst possible scenario."
Washington also has something a
little more tangible going its way — a
front line featuring the Pac-10 Player
of the Year, an all-conference pick,
and 45 points and 23 rebounds a
game among the three of them.
"I'm worried about their over
whelming size," Davis said. "That's
what really worries me. I think we've
got to hang in there on the boards and
get something out of our pressure
defense."
Chris Welp, a 7-foot center who
this week was named the conference
Player of the Year, leads the Huskies.
Welp is averaging just under 20
points and 8.4 rebounds per game.
Paul Fortier, the other all-league
selection, is a 6-9 forward averaging
15 points and 7.4 rebounds per game.
Forward Shag Williams (9.3 points,
7.6 rebounds) rounds out the front
line.
Juniors Greg Hill and Clay Damon
start in the backcourt, where they are
backed up by A 1 Moscatel, who was
voted the Best Sixth Man in the Pac
-10. Moscatel's shot with seven
seconds remaining gave Washington
a 70-69 victory over Stanford in
Maples Pavilion two months ago on
the first weekend of league play.
Stanford could clinch its first .500
season in the conference with a vic
tory tonight. Stanford has had 12
straight losing conference seasons
dating back to 1973.
The Cardinal is also going after its
ninth league victory for the first time
since 1965.
Tonight's game begins at 7:30 p.m.
It will be broadcast on KCBS (740
AM). KZSU will not carry the con
test.
