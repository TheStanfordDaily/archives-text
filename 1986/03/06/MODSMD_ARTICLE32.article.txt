# Ivan thriving on pro circuit
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Who has been wondering what has happened to
Anna Ivan?
Entering Stanford last year, the freshman
phenom was the top-ranked junior in Northern Cal
ifornia and the No. 7 junior in the nation.
She burst onto the Stanford women's tennis
scene, winning 18 of 19 singles matches and 17 of
19 doubles matches. On a talent-laden team that
had won the NCAA Championships in 1984, Ivan
was able to move right in and play anywhere be
tween No. 1 and No. 3 in singles and No. 2 in
doubles. She was regarded as a sure thing.
"She is one of the most natural players I have
ever seen on a tennis court," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said.
In the first tournament of the 1985
season, the Marriot Collegiate Tennis
Classic in Rancho Mirage, Ivan
played No. 1 for the Cardinal and
won the No. 1 singles division and
combined with Patty Fendick to win
the No. 2 doubles division. This early
success catapulted Ivan to a No. 6
NCAA singles ranking, the highest
ranking on the team.
Then, on April 22, citing difficul
ties with Brennan, Ivan quit the team.
Since then, Ivan has achieved
remarkable success. For those of you
who may have lost track of her
recently, you are going to be
pleasantly surprised.
After that day in April, Ivan
finished out the school year and
played on the women's professional
circuit during the summer. The
results have been exceptional. At the
beginning of the summer, her UST A
ranking was 190. By September, her
ranking had risen to 59th in the
world.
In June, Ivan was chosen for the
Federation Cup. This is a team of the
top eight amateurs representing U.S.
colleges and playing professional
tournaments under amateur status.
This selection enabled Ivan to play in
some overseas events.
Ivan began the summer by failing
to qualify for Wimbledon. Her next
tournament had quite different
results, however.
In the UST A Women's Satellite
Circuit of South Carolina on clay,
Ivan reached the semifinals, losing to
eventual champion Caroline
Kuhlman of USC. This was her first
taste of success in 1985.
She then traveled to France with
the Federation Cup squad to compete
in the Soisbouet Cup. It was an inter
national event with three players cho
sen by each team. Ivan, representing
the United States, was selected and
helped to place the U.S. team third
oufof 12 teams.
In her finest tournament of the
summer, Ivan went to the quarter
finals of the U.S. Clay Court Cham
pionships in Indianapolis, losing to
top 10 player, Zina Garrison 6-7, 6-
2, 6-3. "I was pleased to get a set off
her," Ivan said. She won five matches
between the qualifying and main
draw, defeating Kathy Horvath along
the way.
Ivan then played in the Virginia
Slims of Los Angeles, reaching the
second round and recording her most
impressive win. In the first round, she
beat the world's No. 9 player, Wendy

Turnbull, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. "It was a
thrill," Ivan said. "That was one of
the highlights of my summer."
In one of her final summer tourna
ments, Ivan qualified for the main
draw of the U.S. Open. She lost in the
first round to Lisa Bonder.
After her immensely successful
summer, Ivan returned to Stanford in
the fall for classes. She did not play in
any tournaments during this time. "I
couldn't get away," she said. "There
were papers to write and tests to
take."
Ivan decided to stop out winter
quarter and play on the tour full time.
"I figured since I wasn't getting a
chance to take off school and play, I
would give the circuit a try on a trial
basis," she said.
She gradually got her game intact
and put it all together in the Lipton
International Players Tennis Chal
lenge. Ivan reached the round of 16,
beating three players ranked above
her. She defeated Joanne Russell,
Eva Budarova and fifth-seed Bonnie
Gadusek en route to a loss to Kathy
Rinaldi.
Ivan is currently enrolled at Stan
ford and is considering returning in

the spring. But whether she will
return to Stanford is still in question.
"I'm thinking of transferring," Ivan
said. "That is why I'm still an
amateur, to keep my options open."
Where she might go if she decides
to transfer is still up in the air. Ivan is
considering Florida, Kentucky, USC,
UCLA, California and Trinity. "I
haven't narrowed it down yet," she
said. "I don't know if I want to go
back to school and play."
Currently, Ivan is thinking about
the next move in her tennis career.
Since she has spent a good deal of her
life playing tennis, turning pro is a
viable option in the future. "I think it
was inevitable that I play the tour,"
she said.
"I think she is a very talented
player," Brennan said. "I think she
has potential to be a good pro
player."
"I would predict she would
sporadically do well (on the tour),"
ex-teammate Stephanie Savides said.
Although Ivan is somewhat unsure
of her future, of one thing she is cer
tain. "I have no regrets to stopping
out or not playing collegiate tennis,"
she said.

Slims of Los Angeles, reaching the
second round and recording her most
impressive win. In the first round, she
beat the world's No. 9 player, Wendy

Turnbull, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. "It was a
thrill," Ivan said. "That was one of
the highlights of my summer."
In one of her final summer tourna
ments, Ivan qualified for the main
draw of the U.S. Open. She lost in the
first round to Lisa Bonder.
After her immensely successful
summer, Ivan returned to Stanford in
the fall for classes. She did not play in
any tournaments during this time. "I
couldn't get away," she said. "There
were papers to write and tests to
take."
Ivan decided to stop out winter
quarter and play on the tour full time.
"I figured since I wasn't getting a
chance to take off school and play, I
would give the circuit a try on a trial
basis," she said.
She gradually got her game intact
and put it all together in the Lipton
International Players Tennis Chal
lenge. Ivan reached the round of 16,
beating three players ranked above
her. She defeated Joanne Russell,
Eva Budarova and fifth-seed Bonnie
Gadusek en route to a loss to Kathy
Rinaldi.
Ivan is currently enrolled at Stan
ford and is considering returning in

the spring. But whether she will
return to Stanford is still in question.
"I'm thinking of transferring," Ivan
said. "That is why I'm still an
amateur, to keep my options open."
Where she might go if she decides
to transfer is still up in the air. Ivan is
considering Florida, Kentucky, USC,
UCLA, California and Trinity. "I
haven't narrowed it down yet," she
said. "I don't know if I want to go
back to school and play."
Currently, Ivan is thinking about
the next move in her tennis career.
Since she has spent a good deal of her
life playing tennis, turning pro is a
viable option in the future. "I think it
was inevitable that I play the tour,"
she said.
"I think she is a very talented
player," Brennan said. "I think she
has potential to be a good pro
player."
"I would predict she would
sporadically do well (on the tour),"
ex-teammate Stephanie Savides said.
Although Ivan is somewhat unsure
of her future, of one thing she is cer
tain. "I have no regrets to stopping
out or not playing collegiate tennis,"
she said.

Anna Ivan came to Stanford as a highly touted freshman last year but
quit the team late in the season. The Palo Alto native is now playing the
pro tennis circuit after stopping out winter quarter.
Who has been wondering what has happened to
Anna Ivan?
Entering Stanford last year, the freshman
phenom was the top-ranked junior in Northern Cal
ifornia and the No. 7 junior in the nation.
She burst onto the Stanford women's tennis
scene, winning 18 of 19 singles matches and 17 of
19 doubles matches. On a talent-laden team that
had won the NCAA Championships in 1984, Ivan
was able to move right in and play anywhere be
tween No. 1 and No. 3 in singles and No. 2 in
doubles. She was regarded as a sure thing.
"She is one of the most natural players I have
ever seen on a tennis court," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said.
In the first tournament of the 1985
season, the Marriot Collegiate Tennis
Classic in Rancho Mirage, Ivan
played No. 1 for the Cardinal and
won the No. 1 singles division and
combined with Patty Fendick to win
the No. 2 doubles division. This early
success catapulted Ivan to a No. 6
NCAA singles ranking, the highest
ranking on the team.
Then, on April 22, citing difficul
ties with Brennan, Ivan quit the team.
Since then, Ivan has achieved
remarkable success. For those of you
who may have lost track of her
recently, you are going to be
pleasantly surprised.
After that day in April, Ivan
finished out the school year and
played on the women's professional
circuit during the summer. The
results have been exceptional. At the
beginning of the summer, her UST A
ranking was 190. By September, her
ranking had risen to 59th in the
world.
In June, Ivan was chosen for the
Federation Cup. This is a team of the
top eight amateurs representing U.S.
colleges and playing professional
tournaments under amateur status.
This selection enabled Ivan to play in
some overseas events.
Ivan began the summer by failing
to qualify for Wimbledon. Her next
tournament had quite different
results, however.
In the UST A Women's Satellite
Circuit of South Carolina on clay,
Ivan reached the semifinals, losing to
eventual champion Caroline
Kuhlman of USC. This was her first
taste of success in 1985.
She then traveled to France with
the Federation Cup squad to compete
in the Soisbouet Cup. It was an inter
national event with three players cho
sen by each team. Ivan, representing
the United States, was selected and
helped to place the U.S. team third
oufof 12 teams.
In her finest tournament of the
summer, Ivan went to the quarter
finals of the U.S. Clay Court Cham
pionships in Indianapolis, losing to
top 10 player, Zina Garrison 6-7, 6-
2, 6-3. "I was pleased to get a set off
her," Ivan said. She won five matches
between the qualifying and main
draw, defeating Kathy Horvath along
the way.
Ivan then played in the Virginia
Slims of Los Angeles, reaching the
second round and recording her most
impressive win. In the first round, she
beat the world's No. 9 player, Wendy

Turnbull, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. "It was a
