Who has been wondering what has happened to
Anna Ivan?
Entering Stanford last year, the freshman
phenom was the top-ranked junior in Northern Cal
ifornia and the No. 7 junior in the nation.
She burst onto the Stanford women's tennis
scene, winning 18 of 19 singles matches and 17 of
19 doubles matches. On a talent-laden team that
had won the NCAA Championships in 1984, Ivan
was able to move right in and play anywhere be
tween No. 1 and No. 3 in singles and No. 2 in
doubles. She was regarded as a sure thing.
"She is one of the most natural players I have
ever seen on a tennis court," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said.
