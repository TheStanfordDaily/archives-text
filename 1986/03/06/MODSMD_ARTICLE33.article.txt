It took two-and-a-half hours, but the Stanford men's
volleyball team defeated No. 8 Hawaii at Honolulu last
night in five games, 15-11, 10-15, 3-15, 15-9, 15-13.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal is now 8-4 overall and 6-4
in the California Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
(CIVA). Hawaii dropped to 8-5 overall and 5-3 in the
league with the loss.
In the decisive fifth game, Stanford jumped out to a 12-4
lead, but the Rainbows scored nine straight points to go
up 13-12. Then something very unusual — and unfortun
ate for Hawaii — occurred, as server Don Ribrich foot
faulted. Stanford got the serve and closed out the match.
Senior Chris Braun again led the Cardinal in kills, with
31 this match. He also had a .273 hitting percentage. Jon
Root recorded 20 kills and a .412 average, and Scott
Fortune finished with 18 kills. Steve Blue had 14 kills and
a .375 percentage in what Stanford Co-coach Fred Sturm
called "the best match of his career."
For the Rainbows, Jeff Rodgers totaled 28 kills. Pono
Maa followed with 22 and Allen "Repeat" Allen had 17.
Hawaii hit only .198 as a team, while the Cardinal had
a .301 team percentage.
"John McDermott had some key digs for us," Sturm
said. "Our blocking was the best I've seen in a while, and
we served well. This was a significant match because both
teams are fighting for a regional spot."
Hawaii will have a chance to avenge the loss tomorrow
night, when the two squads face off again.
