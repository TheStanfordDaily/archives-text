Soviet adviser for private enterprise
MOSCOW — Abel Aganbegyan, a leading Soviet economist and key
adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, endorsed the idea of allow
ing private companies to provide a wide variety of consumer services.
Aganbegyan, who appeared yesterday at an officially sponsored
meeting with reporters to discuss his economic thinking, was once con
sidered unorthodox, but Gorbachev's plan for radical reform of the lag
ging Soviet economy has brought Aganbegyan and his associates into the
mainstream.
In addition to advocating a role for private enterprise to compete with
notoriously inefficient state-run services, Aganbegyan said he was
opposed to multibillion-dollar government subsidies that keep down the
price of meat, milk and bread.
As chairman of a state committee for studying productive forces, his
views are expected to carry weight. Soviet sources said that as a personal
adviser to Gorbachev, he has written some of the leader's speeches on
economic subjects.
Aganbegyan said he favored development of the private sector to pro
vide a wide variety of services that are now offered legally only in state
stores, where customer satisfaction is reported to be minimal.
Private companies are permitted to provide such services in East Ger
many and Bulgaria, he said.
"In a socialist country, it (private enterprise) can't be a main form of
economic activity but it can supplement the main work," he said. "My
personal belief is that it would be highly useful and has to be
developed."
Blacks call for continued protests
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Black political leaders called
yesterday for continued anti-apartheid protests despite the minority
white government's statement that it will lift the six-month-old state of
emergency, probably tomorrow.
Speaking at a mass funeral for 17 victims of recent civil strife, the
leaders warned that the government must do much more to meet black
demands if the unrest is to end and a dialogue is to begin on resolving the
country's problems.
"We are going to pin this government against the wall more and
more," Albertina Sisulu, co-president of the United Democratic Front
and wife of one of the imprisoned leaders of the African National
Congress, Walter Sisulu, told more than 20,000 mourners in Alexandra,
one of Johannesburg's black ghettos. "Lifting the state of emergency —
that doesn't mean anything, man. We want freedom, that's what we
want."
President Pieter Botha told the parliament Tuesday that he intended
to lift the state of emergency, which gives the police virtually martial-law
powers, in an effort to bring moderate black leaders into open discus
sions on the future of the country.
The 17 buried yesterday, in one of the largest mass funerals in South
Africa over the last year and a half of unrest, were among those killed in
four days of fierce clashes with police in Alexandra last month.
Arab force nears Kuwaiti border
TEHRAN, Iran — An Arab rapid deployment force was reported
yesterday to be moving toward the Kuwaiti border after Iran said that its
gunboats had entered Khor Abdullah, a 3-mile-wide waterway mostly
under Kuwaiti jurisdiction.
An Iranian military communique said that the boats had engaged the
Iraqi navy in a battle which ended in the sinking of one Iraqi vessel and
extensive damage to another.
Yesterday's reported naval action near Kuwait fueled fears that the
battlefield deadlock may precipitate a widening of hostilities in the Gulf.
Kuwaiti's Defense Minister Sheikh Salem A 1 Sabah warned that
Kuwaiti forces had strict orders to shoot "if there is any trespassing of
the declared lines."
Police get sketch of Palme's killer
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — A portrait artist who said she saw the
shooting of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme has provided a sketch of
the suspected killer, police said yesterday.
The 22-year-old woman will now work with West German experts
from the Federal Criminal Police office at Wiesbaden in drawing up a
more detailed portrait of the suspect, a spokesman said.
Swedish police would not comment when asked whether there was a
connection between West German police involvement and claims by
West German terrorist groups that they killed Palme.
The woman contacted police on Sunday to say that she witnessed the
killing late Friday and that she believed that she clearly saw the face of
Palme's killer under a street lamp before he fled.
Stockholm Police Chief Hans Wanghult said that several details of the
sketch matched descriptions given by other witnesses.
Police said that they also were searching for a car which sped from the
scene of the assassination after a man answering the killer's description
jumped in. The car was seen by a Stockholm taxi driver and also by a
policeman who did not immediately connect it with the shooting.
Several heads of government have announced that theywill attend the
March 15 funeral for Palme, including Rajiv Gandi of India, Bettino
Craxi of Italy, Felipe Gonzales of Spain, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, a close friend of
Palme, is due to make one of the major eulogies at the service.
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzkhov and U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar are also due to attend. It is still unclear whether
Vice President George Bush or Secretary of State George Shultz will
represent the United States.
Canada plans major social changes
TORONTO — The Canadian government, in a sweeping set of social
changes to comply with a new constitutional Charter of Rights, has said
that it intends to remove barriers preventing homosexuals from serving
in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other services, plans to
abolish mandatory retirement for federal! civil servants and will seek to
broaden the role of women in the military.
Given the large parliamentary majority held by the Conservative gov
ernment of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the longstanding tradi
tion of party discipline, approval of the series of changes that Attorney
General John Crosbie detailed before Parliament yesterday normally
would be a routine matter.
However, several members of Mulroney's party indicated that they
were strongly opposed to some of the proposed changes, particularly the
one prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in all
areas of federal jurisdiction. They indicated they would press to be
released from their commitment to support government legislation.
Car bomb kills three in Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A car-bomb exploded yesterday in the south
ern port of Sidon, killing three people and touching off a street battle be
tween Shia and Sunni Moslem militiamen, police reported.
The driver and a woman passenger died in the explosion and several
passers-by were injured, radio reports said.
The Sunni Voice of the Homeland Radio in West Beirut said that the
fighting broke out when Shia Amal militiamen in an ambulance
transporting injured victims of the blast got into an argument with Sunni
militiament. One militiaman was killed and four other people wounded.
The incident reflected the increasing tension between Sunnis and
Shias in Sidon. The Sunnis Tuesday ignored a strike called by Amal in
South Lebanon in memory of two Shias killed last year by Israeli troops.

ern port of Sidon, killing three people and touching off a street battle be
tween Shia and Sunni Moslem militiamen, police reported.
The driver and a woman passenger died in the explosion and several
passers-by were injured, radio reports said.
The Sunni Voice of the Homeland Radio in West Beirut said that the
fighting broke out when Shia Amal militiamen in an ambulance
transporting injured victims of the blast got into an argument with Sunni
militiament. One militiaman was killed and four other people wounded.
The incident reflected the increasing tension between Sunnis and
Shias in Sidon. The Sunnis Tuesday ignored a strike called by Amal in
South Lebanon in memory of two Shias killed last year by Israeli troops.
Soviet adviser for private enterprise
MOSCOW — Abel Aganbegyan, a leading Soviet economist and key
adviser to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, endorsed the idea of allow
ing private companies to provide a wide variety of consumer services.
Aganbegyan, who appeared yesterday at an officially sponsored
meeting with reporters to discuss his economic thinking, was once con
sidered unorthodox, but Gorbachev's plan for radical reform of the lag
ging Soviet economy has brought Aganbegyan and his associates into the
mainstream.
In addition to advocating a role for private enterprise to compete with
notoriously inefficient state-run services, Aganbegyan said he was
opposed to multibillion-dollar government subsidies that keep down the
price of meat, milk and bread.
As chairman of a state committee for studying productive forces, his
views are expected to carry weight. Soviet sources said that as a personal
adviser to Gorbachev, he has written some of the leader's speeches on
economic subjects.
Aganbegyan said he favored development of the private sector to pro
vide a wide variety of services that are now offered legally only in state
stores, where customer satisfaction is reported to be minimal.
Private companies are permitted to provide such services in East Ger
many and Bulgaria, he said.
"In a socialist country, it (private enterprise) can't be a main form of
economic activity but it can supplement the main work," he said. "My
personal belief is that it would be highly useful and has to be
developed."
Blacks call for continued protests
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Black political leaders called
yesterday for continued anti-apartheid protests despite the minority
white government's statement that it will lift the six-month-old state of
emergency, probably tomorrow.
Speaking at a mass funeral for 17 victims of recent civil strife, the
leaders warned that the government must do much more to meet black
demands if the unrest is to end and a dialogue is to begin on resolving the
country's problems.
"We are going to pin this government against the wall more and
more," Albertina Sisulu, co-president of the United Democratic Front
and wife of one of the imprisoned leaders of the African National
Congress, Walter Sisulu, told more than 20,000 mourners in Alexandra,
one of Johannesburg's black ghettos. "Lifting the state of emergency —
that doesn't mean anything, man. We want freedom, that's what we
want."
President Pieter Botha told the parliament Tuesday that he intended
to lift the state of emergency, which gives the police virtually martial-law
powers, in an effort to bring moderate black leaders into open discus
sions on the future of the country.
The 17 buried yesterday, in one of the largest mass funerals in South
Africa over the last year and a half of unrest, were among those killed in
four days of fierce clashes with police in Alexandra last month.
Arab force nears Kuwaiti border
TEHRAN, Iran — An Arab rapid deployment force was reported
yesterday to be moving toward the Kuwaiti border after Iran said that its
gunboats had entered Khor Abdullah, a 3-mile-wide waterway mostly
under Kuwaiti jurisdiction.
An Iranian military communique said that the boats had engaged the
Iraqi navy in a battle which ended in the sinking of one Iraqi vessel and
extensive damage to another.
Yesterday's reported naval action near Kuwait fueled fears that the
battlefield deadlock may precipitate a widening of hostilities in the Gulf.
Kuwaiti's Defense Minister Sheikh Salem A 1 Sabah warned that
Kuwaiti forces had strict orders to shoot "if there is any trespassing of
the declared lines."
Police get sketch of Palme's killer
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — A portrait artist who said she saw the
shooting of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme has provided a sketch of
the suspected killer, police said yesterday.
The 22-year-old woman will now work with West German experts
from the Federal Criminal Police office at Wiesbaden in drawing up a
more detailed portrait of the suspect, a spokesman said.
Swedish police would not comment when asked whether there was a
connection between West German police involvement and claims by
West German terrorist groups that they killed Palme.
The woman contacted police on Sunday to say that she witnessed the
killing late Friday and that she believed that she clearly saw the face of
Palme's killer under a street lamp before he fled.
Stockholm Police Chief Hans Wanghult said that several details of the
sketch matched descriptions given by other witnesses.
Police said that they also were searching for a car which sped from the
scene of the assassination after a man answering the killer's description
jumped in. The car was seen by a Stockholm taxi driver and also by a
policeman who did not immediately connect it with the shooting.
Several heads of government have announced that theywill attend the
March 15 funeral for Palme, including Rajiv Gandi of India, Bettino
Craxi of Italy, Felipe Gonzales of Spain, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, a close friend of
Palme, is due to make one of the major eulogies at the service.
Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzkhov and U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar are also due to attend. It is still unclear whether
Vice President George Bush or Secretary of State George Shultz will
represent the United States.
Canada plans major social changes
TORONTO — The Canadian government, in a sweeping set of social
changes to comply with a new constitutional Charter of Rights, has said
that it intends to remove barriers preventing homosexuals from serving
in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other services, plans to
abolish mandatory retirement for federal! civil servants and will seek to
broaden the role of women in the military.
Given the large parliamentary majority held by the Conservative gov
ernment of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the longstanding tradi
tion of party discipline, approval of the series of changes that Attorney
General John Crosbie detailed before Parliament yesterday normally
would be a routine matter.
However, several members of Mulroney's party indicated that they
were strongly opposed to some of the proposed changes, particularly the
one prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in all
areas of federal jurisdiction. They indicated they would press to be
released from their commitment to support government legislation.
