MANILA, Philippines â€” The gov
ernment of Philippine President
Corazon Aquino overrode objections
from its military leaders yesterday
and released four imprisoned mem
bers of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, including two of its top
leaders.
The releases, which include that of
Jose Maria Sison, a founder and first
chairman of the party, are part of
Aquino's policy of reconciliation with
the country's Communist rebels.
They appear to signal a consolidation
of her authority over the military
leaders who led last month's rebellion
against former President Ferdinand
Marcos and boosted her into power.
In another development, a lawyer
in last year's trial of the assassination

of Corazon Aquino's husband,
Benigno Aquino Jr., said two of the
military men charged and later ac
quitted in the 1983 slaying had
confessed their guilt. Attorney
Lupino Lazaro also said new wit
nesses, who had been afraid to testify
under the Marcos regime, had come
forward since Marcos' departure last
week, offering new evidence that jus
tified reopening the trial.
In remarks reported by the official
Philippine News Agency, Lazaro said
a team of lawyers was tracking down
the military officers accused in the
killing, most of whom are still in the
country. The most prominent defen
dant, Marcos' armed forces chief of
staff, Gen. Fabian Ver, fled with
Marcos to Hawaii last week. Ver, 24

other military men, and one civilian
were acquitted of all charges in con
nection with the killing.
Prospects for a cease-fire with the
insurgents of the New People s Army,
the Communist Party's armed wing,
remained uncertain, as Defense Mini
ster Juan Ponce Enrile and Sison
spoke cautiously about the chances
for reconciliation between the gov
ernment and the insurgents.
Although Sison did not specifically
renounce violence under questioning
at several press conferences through
out the day, he said he signed a docu
ment promising he will "not seek to
overthrow the government by violent
means or force." He said he would be
spending his time lecturing and
writing a book about Marcos.
