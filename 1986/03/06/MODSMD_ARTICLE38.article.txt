WASHINGTON â€” President
Reagan, frustrated by Soviet foot
dragging, declared yesterday that he
will not go to Moscow in 1987 to
meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev if the Kremlin leader reneges on
his commitment to visit Washington
this year.
When asked at a breakfast session
with reporters whether the coming
summit could "slip through our fin
gers" because of apparent Soviet re
luctance to set a firm date, Reagan
said: "If it does slip through our fin
gers, I've got news for them. There
won't be an '87 summit in Moscow."
The president also assailed the
Soviets for not formally replying to
either his November proposal on
strategic weapons or a February ini
tiative on the elimination of U.S. and
Soviet missiles in Europe. "We were
the only ones playing," he said of the
latest round of arms talks in Geneva,
which ended Tuesday.

The Administration would like the
second summit meeting to be held
before August to avoid bumping into
the November elections. The Soviets
have indicated that they prefer Sep
tember, but Reagan, his irritation
showing, said that they have not
tabled any date as a formal proposal.
"We're still sticking to the early
summer because of our own elec
tion," Reagan said. "We've explained
this to them, that this would be kind
of complicated and heavy-duty for us
to try and combine the two things.
We have not had a formal answer one
way or the other."
As each side raised the stakes in
the date debate, White House
spokesman Larry Speakes stressed
the here-or-never condition that the
next superpower summit would take
place in Washington. "If it's not held
in '86, it will be held in '87, perhaps,"
he said.
