## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Two House
panels yesterday rejected Presi
dent Reagan's request for $100
million in aid to the Nicaraguan
contras, even as the president
warned that final rejection could
mean "a sea of red, eventually lap
ping at our own borders."
The House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence voted 9
to 7 against the aid package, which
would include $30 million in non
military aid and $70 million in
covert military aid to be handled
through the Central Intelligence
Agency and the Defense Depart
ment. About one hour later, the
House Foreign Affairs subcom
mittee on Western Hemisphere af
fairs rejected the measure 8 to 5
along party lines.
The votes were the first test of
House sentiment on the contra aid
proposal, which is moving quickly

through four committees toward a
final vote in the Democratic
controlled House. Speaker
Thomas (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-
Mass.) yesterday scheduled that
for March 19, and a Senate vote is
also expected that week.
White House deputy press sec
retary Edward Djerejian, asked
his response to the vote, said,
"The opera isn't over until the fat
lady sings."
Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Calif.)
chairman of the Democratic Con
gressional Campaign Committee,
denounced the Administration's
remarks as "red-baiting" and said
they would have no effect on
public sentiment.
Earlier in the day, House Dem
ocrats signaled their negative
mood on the issue in a report that
criticized Reagan's overall Central
America policy as a failure.
