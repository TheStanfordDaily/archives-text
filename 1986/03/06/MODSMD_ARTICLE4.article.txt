# Officials plan meeting about party disruptions
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Responding to disruptions involving non-
Stanford students at recent campus parties,
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons has rec
ommended several steps to prevent future inci
dents and has called a meeting for residence of
ficials and police to discuss the growing prob
lem.
In a letter sent yesterday inviting residents
fellows, resident assistants, house presidents
and house social chairmen to the meeting,
Lyons said, "All of [those responsible for the
disruptions] have in common the fact that, be
cause they're not members of this community,
they have little to lose and much to gain by
choosing Stanford as their party place. They do

not share our assumptions about how people
behave and are accountable to each other here.
"Many of them are minors; some are in their
early teens. Others, on the other hand, are
much older," Lyons said.
Recent incidents include party disruptions at
the Theta Xi and Sigma Chi fraternities.
Police closed a party Friday night at Theta Xi
when followers of two punk bands playing there
entered the building through windows and a fire
escape and disrupted the gathering.
Norm Robinson, associate dean for residen
tial education, said that students there "did
everything right but still couldn't control the
number of non-Stanford people," and that, at
another party, those who were denied
entrance "came back and trashed the
kitchen. There's a sense of being in
undated."
Individual incidents have included
assaults on policemen, fights between
Stanford students and non-University
people, drunkenness and rough activ
ity that caused at least one person to
be rushed to the hospital, according
to Lyons.

"Risks to individuals, student
groups and the University have risen
to the point that something has to be
done, and fast," Lyons said in the let
ter. "Risks include physical harm
(from fights), financial (from thefts
and damage to personal and house
property) and legal (from the very
high probability of civil and criminal
suits arising because someone has
gotten drunk, been injured or even
has died after attending a party).
"These are not chances any of us
can afford to take," Lyons said, add
ing that he hopes residence officials

will attend the meeting tomorrow to
discuss ways to reduce the risks.
The meeting will be primarily a
chance for students and police to
share their experiences in dealing
with non-Stanford disruption in order
to find solutions, he said.
Among the suggestions he made to
future party hosts were:
• to appoint one person to act as a
liaison with University officials and
the police in case they are called and
to notify police and the residence
dean ahead of time of the person's
name;

• to appoint house members to act as
monitors for doors, halls, windows
and refreshment areas and to require
Stanford I.D.s for admission;
• to keep all doors locked except the
one used to admit guests;
• to follow the University's alcohol
policy;
• to control the noise of the party in
order to avoid attracting people
searching for a party and receiving
complaints from the community; and
• to exercise care in hiring the band
in order to avoid attracting a non-
Stanford following.
