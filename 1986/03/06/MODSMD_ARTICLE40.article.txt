Reagan rejects oil tax
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yester
day withdrew his tentative support of an oil
import fee which is part of the pending tax
revision bill, and also turned aside pleas from
Senate Republicans that he negotiate a compro
mise on the budget before asking them to vote on
the tax bill.
In a group interview with reporters, Reagan
said some of the "compromises" suggested in a
letter Tuesday from 50 senators involved a "total
repudiation" of his position, and reiterated that
there was "just no way" he would approve a tax
increase as part of any budget deal.
A few hours later, the Republican-controlled
Senate Budget Committee scheduled a vote for
today on Reagan's budget, which is almost cer
tain to go down to defeat. Asked later why he
acceded so readily to Sen. Howard Metzen
baum's (D-Ohio) demand foi an early vote,
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) said, "We
want to get it out (of the way). Why keep fussing
around?"
The committee's first session on the budget
was marked by bipartisan warnings that a tax in
crease and what Domenici called "some damn
tough choices" on spending cuts will be necessary
to meet this year's deficit target.
The twin developments underlined the dis
tance between the president and legislators of
both parties as the budget battle begins. The
same message was conveyed in Tuesday's letter
from half the Senate.
The 50 senators, including two-thirds of the
chamber's Republicans, had written Reagan that
"until a firm, definite budget agreement has been
reached between the Congress and the White
House, we do not believe tax reform should be
considered or debated by the United States Sen
ate.

Arms expert rips House
W ASHINGTON — The Pentagon's arms con
trol expert charged yesterday that just as the
United States was receiving indications of Soviet
movement toward progress on a nuclear test
treaty, the House of Representatives undercut
U.S. negotiators by urging President Reagan to
seek Senate approval of two unratified agree
ments.
The official, Richard Perle, assistant secretary
of defense for international security policy, did
little to disguise his annoyance, saying that "there
is no limit to the irresponsibility to which some
House Democrats can sink."
While Perle was said at the Pentagon to be
speaking for himself and not Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger, the views he ex
pressed echoed those of other senior officials,
one of whom said: "He's not alone in feeling that
way in the department."
In a party-line vote, the Democratic majority
in the House last Wednesday succeeded in
adopted a resolution urging Reagan to submit to
the Senate treaties reached with the Soviet Union
in 1974 and 1976, which would ban underground
testing of large nuclear bombs. The Reagan Ad
ministration has been skeptical about the ac
curacy of procedures for verifying Soviet compli
ance with such test bans.
Perle, in remarks at a breakfast with a small
group of reporters, said that "in all likelihood,
the House resolution will have killed" the Soviet
incentive to relax its opposition to compliance
verification standards sought by the United
States. He made similar comments later in the
day at a National Press Club luncheon.
The resolution "is unprecedented and unhelp
ful and irresponsible," he said.

President trusts panel
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in his
first public comments on NASA's allegedly
"flawed" decision-making, said yesterday that he
expected the presidential commission investigat
ing the Challenger space shuttle explosion to de
termine "whether anyone knowingly just
gambled and took a chance or whether it was just
error in judgment" that led to the doomed
launch.
"Whether it was intentional or not, there were
ways in which counsel and advice in regard to the
safety factor could be ignored and the launch
took place with the tragic follow-up," Reagan
told reporters at a breakfast session in the White
House.
But the president maintained that the unset
tling testimony heard by the commission did not
alter his commitment to manned space flights.
Reagan, saying that the cause of the crash was
becoming "more evident every day," added that
the commission's task was to ensure that "this
sort of thing can never happen again." Testimony
has indicated so far that the Jan. 28 explosion of
the Challenger was caused by a combination of
unusually cold weather and faulty seals on the
booster rockets.

NEW YORK — Stock prices finished mixed

becoming "more evident every day," added that
the commission's task was to ensure that "this
sort of thing can never happen again." Testimony
has indicated so far that the Jan. 28 explosion of
the Challenger was caused by a combination of
unusually cold weather and faulty seals on the
booster rockets.
Prices finish mixed

despite a sharp rebound in interest rates.

down about 12 points at midday, finished with a
.24 gain at 1,686.66.
Reagan rejects oil tax
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yester
day withdrew his tentative support of an oil
import fee which is part of the pending tax
revision bill, and also turned aside pleas from
Senate Republicans that he negotiate a compro
mise on the budget before asking them to vote on
the tax bill.
In a group interview with reporters, Reagan
said some of the "compromises" suggested in a
letter Tuesday from 50 senators involved a "total
repudiation" of his position, and reiterated that
there was "just no way" he would approve a tax
increase as part of any budget deal.
A few hours later, the Republican-controlled
Senate Budget Committee scheduled a vote for
today on Reagan's budget, which is almost cer
tain to go down to defeat. Asked later why he
acceded so readily to Sen. Howard Metzen
baum's (D-Ohio) demand foi an early vote,
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) said, "We
want to get it out (of the way). Why keep fussing
around?"
The committee's first session on the budget
was marked by bipartisan warnings that a tax in
crease and what Domenici called "some damn
tough choices" on spending cuts will be necessary
to meet this year's deficit target.
The twin developments underlined the dis
tance between the president and legislators of
both parties as the budget battle begins. The
same message was conveyed in Tuesday's letter
from half the Senate.
The 50 senators, including two-thirds of the
chamber's Republicans, had written Reagan that
"until a firm, definite budget agreement has been
reached between the Congress and the White
House, we do not believe tax reform should be
considered or debated by the United States Sen
ate.

Arms expert rips House
W ASHINGTON — The Pentagon's arms con
trol expert charged yesterday that just as the
United States was receiving indications of Soviet
movement toward progress on a nuclear test
treaty, the House of Representatives undercut
U.S. negotiators by urging President Reagan to
seek Senate approval of two unratified agree
ments.
The official, Richard Perle, assistant secretary
of defense for international security policy, did
little to disguise his annoyance, saying that "there
is no limit to the irresponsibility to which some
House Democrats can sink."
While Perle was said at the Pentagon to be
speaking for himself and not Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger, the views he ex
pressed echoed those of other senior officials,
one of whom said: "He's not alone in feeling that
way in the department."
In a party-line vote, the Democratic majority
in the House last Wednesday succeeded in
adopted a resolution urging Reagan to submit to
the Senate treaties reached with the Soviet Union
in 1974 and 1976, which would ban underground
testing of large nuclear bombs. The Reagan Ad
ministration has been skeptical about the ac
curacy of procedures for verifying Soviet compli
ance with such test bans.
Perle, in remarks at a breakfast with a small
group of reporters, said that "in all likelihood,
the House resolution will have killed" the Soviet
incentive to relax its opposition to compliance
verification standards sought by the United
States. He made similar comments later in the
day at a National Press Club luncheon.
The resolution "is unprecedented and unhelp
ful and irresponsible," he said.

President trusts panel
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in his
first public comments on NASA's allegedly
"flawed" decision-making, said yesterday that he
expected the presidential commission investigat
ing the Challenger space shuttle explosion to de
termine "whether anyone knowingly just
gambled and took a chance or whether it was just
error in judgment" that led to the doomed
launch.
"Whether it was intentional or not, there were
ways in which counsel and advice in regard to the
safety factor could be ignored and the launch
took place with the tragic follow-up," Reagan
told reporters at a breakfast session in the White
House.
But the president maintained that the unset
tling testimony heard by the commission did not
alter his commitment to manned space flights.
Reagan, saying that the cause of the crash was
becoming "more evident every day," added that
the commission's task was to ensure that "this
sort of thing can never happen again." Testimony
has indicated so far that the Jan. 28 explosion of
the Challenger was caused by a combination of
unusually cold weather and faulty seals on the
booster rockets.
