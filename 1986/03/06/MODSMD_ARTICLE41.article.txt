Texaco closes 1,500 wells
Texaco closed down about 1,500 oil wells in
California's huge Kern River field near
Bakersfield last weekend because the collapse of
oil prices has made them unprofitable, the com
pany said yesterday.
It was the first such action by a major oil com
pany in California, but probably not the last.
Even before the Texaco action, as many as 3,000
small, independently owned wells in the state
have been closed since Jan. 1 because of falling
oil prices, industry officials estimated.
Similar industry cutbacks have begun in other
parts of the United States, especially oil-rich
Texas, as the price of crude oil falls below the
cost of production at many individual wells, par
ticularly those that are older and less productive.
But the action by Texaco in the Kern River area
is one of the largest such steps so far by a major
producer in U.S. fields.
The number of jobs to be lost as a result of the
well closings to date could not be determined.
Texaco said that none of its own employees
would be affected, but other companies that

maintain the wells and perform other services for
Texaco presumably would have to cut back.
Economists at Bank of America have esti
mated that 7,000 oil-field jobs in California
could be lost due to the sharp falloff in the price
of oil.
BankAmerica goes solo
LOS ANGELES — Financially troubled
BankAmerica Corp., which reportedly received a
takeover proposal from First Interstate Bancorp,
the nation's eighth largest bank holding concern,
said yesterday it isn't negotiating a merger.
However, San Francisco-based BankAmerica,
the nation's No. 2 banking company after
Citicorp of New York, declined to confirm
whether it had received an offer from Los
Angeles-based First Interstate.
In a brief statement, Bank America's president
and chief executive, Samuel Armacost, said: "We
have a carefully thought-out strategy in place,
which we believe will restore BankAmerica to its
historic levels of profitability (and) enhance
shareholder values."

Lt. Gov. launches bid
SAN FRANCISCO — Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy
launched a re-election bid yesterday, emphasiz
ing achievements as a Democrat and his current
fight for toxic cleanups rather than attacking Re
publican contenders for the post.
"I've proved that someone who really wants
to, can make the lieutenant governor's office an
important office to work to solve problems in this
state," the 55-year-old San Francisco Democrat
said.
Meanwhile in Los Angeles State Sen. H.L.
Richardson also filed his papers for the Republi
can nomination for lieutenant governor yester
day, saying he is "convinced I'm the only person
who has a real chance of beating (Democratic in
cumbent) Leo McCarthy."
Today's weather
Dense morning fog Thursday, becoming
mostly sunny by midday. Highs in the 60s and
70s.
