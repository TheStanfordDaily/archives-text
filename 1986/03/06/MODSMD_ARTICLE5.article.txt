# $297 million budget asked
## But federal reform may cause cutbacks 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Stanford will require a 1986 oper
ating budget of $297 million, accord
ing to proposed guidelines that will be
circulated today to the Faculty Sen
ate.
The proposed budget, to be sub
mitted Tuesday to the Board of Trus
tees, provides for salary increases
above the current rate of inflation
and nearly $30 million in financial aid
but makes no provision for possible
federal cutbacks, according to Assoc.
Provost Timothy Warner.
"(Federal restrictions) haven't
been factored in because we don't
know what they are yet," Warner said
yesterday.
"Given the uncertainty of the cur
rent situation, it does not seem pro
ductive to engage in an extensive con
tingency planning exercise at this
time, one which could only alter nor
mal processes," Provost James Rosse
notes in the proposed guidelines.
Warner acknowledged, however,
that certain provisions have been
considered to compensate for possi
ble "storm clouds" from Washington,
which include a threatened limit to
indirect cost recovery by universities.
While tuition and fees will provide
about $134 million in revenue, about
45 percent of the operating budget,
the amount allotted for financial aid
will ensure the continuation of Stan
ford's "need-blind" policy of admis
sion, Warner said.
However, students receiving finan
cial aid will be expected to provide
about a quarter of the individual stu
dent budget, which is estimated at
$17,458, with tuition amounting to
$11,208.
The proposed budget guidelines
also include 6.3 percent salary in
creases in the schools of Humanities
and Sciences, Earth Sciences, Educa

tion, Engineering and Law.
The Graduate School of Business
and the School of Medicine are re
sponsible for funding salary incre
ments through their own tuition and
restricted income.
Discrepencies between salary hikes
in the humanities and the technical
sciences are regulated by a salary
control figure affecting all faculty
across the University, Warner said.
About 75 percent of total expendi
tures stem from salaries, benefits and
related costs.
Teaching assistant stipends are ex
pected to be increased from $6,918 to
$7,485, while teaching fellows would
enjoy an increase from $7,329 to
$8,001.
An expenditure of $547,000 has
also been proposed to strengthen the
fund-raising activities of the Devel
opment Office in preparation for the
University's centennial.
The consolidated budget, a more
inclusive measure of University ex
penditures, is expected to total $787
million. Besides the operating
budget, this includes sponsored re
search, auxiliary enterprises, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator and
other costs.
During 1984-85, Stanford realized
a 12 percent rate in research volume.
It expects to achieve a 10 percent in
crease this year and projects 7.5 per
cent further growth in 1986-87.
The proposed guidelines also in
clude:
• faculty and staff salary increases at
rate higher than that of inflation,
which is currently projected at 4.5
percent;
• the first in a series of three
$160,500 annual allocations for 10
new graduate fellowships in the
humanities;
• a $ 1.4 million increase for academic
computing.
