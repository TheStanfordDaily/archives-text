# Haley emphasizes family ties
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
Students have a responsibility to work for
the benefit of their families — to represent
the "better day" — author Alex Haley told
an audience of 150 last night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
"The most important thing you can do is
to try to see yourself in perspective," Haley
said at a reception in Soto house following
his speech.
"Your responsibility is to make things
better for you and the family you are a part
of."
The 65-year-old Haley, whose speech was
sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
became an international celebrity after the
1976 publication of his Pulitzer Prize
winning epic " Roots: The Saga of an Ameri
can Family." The book, which Haley said
took him nine years to write, delineates his
descent from African slaves.
Haley expressed concern that "fewer and
fewer little children are being directed
towards their grandparents."
"Nobody can do, particularly for little
children, what grandparents do
grandparents sprinkle stardust over the lives
of little children," Haley said.
"If one, whomever it is, is so blessed as to
have living grandparents, then you really
don't have anything much more important
to do than to walk up to them, wherever
they may be, and simply open your arms and
hug them," Haley urged.
Students should thank their grandparents
for making them and their families possible,
he said.
Haley recalled how his grandmother and
her sisters sat rocking on the front porch of
his Henning, Tenn. home telling the family
history. "That was the summer when I was
six, and it was the summer that really
'Roots' was born," Haley said.
Haley insisted that he had no idea how
great an impact 'Roots' would have. "The
main thing that I had in my mind was: Let

me finish this forever-long book," Haley
said. "I had vastly, sadly, over-researched
' Roots' because I didn't know what n.y story
was."
"I was staggered at the popularity of
'Roots' — there had been no modern pre
cedent for' Roots'," he said.
" 'Roots' is not just the story of my fam
ily. .. . 'Roots' is the story of U.S. black
people in symbol," said Haley, adding
"Almost all U.S. black people share the
same broad generic story."
" ' Roots' gave people a lot of insight into

the 'black experience,' " Haley said. "It is a
general, generic, insightful look into the
black experience."
Haley said that he believes 'Roots' pro
vides an accurate portrayal of black slavery.
"Prior to 'Roots', the biggest image maker
of the history of Africa was Tarzan. I'll tell
you, 'Roots' is a lot closer to the truth than
Tarzan."
Haley also touched on his association with
Malcolm X. Haley spent two years with the

late militant black leader authoring
the 1965 book "The Autobiography
of Makolm X."
Makolm X never saw the finished
book, according to Haley. Haley
turned the manuscript in on a
Thursday and that Sunday Makolm
X was shot and killed in New York
City.
"1 felt the great loss of a very
strong, strong person," Haley said of
Malcolm X*s assassination. "1 guess
the biggest thing 1 learned from Mal
colm was his sense of self discipline,
his dedication and his thoughts."
Haley said his next book, about his
hometown Henning, Tenn., will be
published in September. He said suc
cess has given him less time to write.
"My worry at one time was funds,
now it is time."
But Haley insisted he will continue
to write, despite the difficulties of
free time. He said he would like to be
remembered for the books that he
wrote, "Not necessarily 'Roots', but
books across the board — that's more
than any writer could ask for."
