Four Stanford faculty members
have been named to the National
Academy of Engineering, consid
ered the highest professional dis
tinction for engineers.
Edward Feigenbaum, a profes
sor of computer science, was
awarded "for pioneering contribu
tion to knowledge engineering and
expert systems technology, and for
leadership in education and tech
nology of applied artificial intelli
gence."
Feigenbaum has been the direc
tor of the Heuristic Programming
Project since the early 19705. The
main focus of this project is the re
search of the role of knowledge in
problem-solving and learning sys
tems.
Kaye Lathrop, associate direc
tor of the technical division at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, was recognized "for seminal
work in developing neutron
transport methods worldwide."
John Shaw, a professor of ap
plied physics, has been cited "for
his leadership in developing the
ory and design procedures for

acoustic-surface-wave devices and
applications of optical fibers.
"Acoustic-surface-wave devices
are devices that use pulses
(vibrational waves in solids) to
convey information. The develop
ment of these devices are applied
to signal and data processing.
Optical fibers are used for high
speed signal processing and other
complex forms of communica
tion," Shaw said.
Arthur Veinott Jr., a professor
of operations research, was
awarded for "his fundamental
contributions to operations rearch
and engineering theory and
practice, especially inventory the
ory and Markovian decision
processes."
The four were among 73 scien
tists whose selection was an
nounced by Academy President
Robert White. Academy member
ship is granted to those who have
made "important contributions to
engineering theory and practice,
including significant contributions
to the literature of engineering" or
to those who have achieved
"unusual accomplishments in new
and developing fields of technol
ogy."
