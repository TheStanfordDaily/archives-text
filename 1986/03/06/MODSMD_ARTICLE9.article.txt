# Dozen divvy up Dean's award
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
Many of them said they were
shocked when Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons called them into his
Old Union office. But to those who
know them, it was no surprise that
they had been selected winners of this
quarter s Dean s Awards for Service.
The 12 award recipients, honored
for their volunteer work here, were
served by Lyons and his wife at a din
ner and awards ceremony in the
Lyons' home last night.
To an old friend of award-winner
Kristin Kirchner, a senior industrial
engineering major, the selection only
made sense. "1 wasn't surprised at
all," Jenny Williams said. "Kristin
really earned it."
Kirchner, known affectionately as
"Mom" by the freshmen at Donner,
where she is an RA this year, was
cited for her volunteer service as
statistician for the men's basketball
team and her "willingness to tackle
the big and thankless jobs" such as
finding and transporting hundreds of
new freshmen to the Farm.
Kirchner, who said she hopes to
engage in church or community

service following graduation, prefers
to think of herself as "just a part of
the family," she said.
Junior psychology major Michael
Tuchin was also hesitant to single
himself out from other students.
Honored with his roommate Scott
Martin, a history major, for bringing
the Big Game bonfire back home to
the Lagunita lakebed and for "going
beyond nostalgia to rekindle the
pyromania in us all," Tuchin praised
the entire Axe Committee for its
dedication to re-igniting Stanford
spirit.
"Our basic goal was to increase
(student) spirit," said Tuchin, who
worked nearly 100 hours and slept
out at the Boathouse three nights to
keep watch on the project.
"We go to Stanford and after we
graduate we appreciate what Stan
ford has," he said last night. But,
"people don't realize it enough when
they're here. They get wrapped up in
their school work and forget what
Stanford has."
Steve Phillips, an English and
African and Afro-American studies
major and president of the Black Stu
dent Union, is not one to take the
Farm for granted. Phillips was cited

for "a collegiate career of service
unique in its depth and breadth, span
ning residences, varsity athletics, stu
dent government, politics and jour
nalism" and for working "to improve
his world and his university."
This year's Stanford pow-wow or
ganizer, Debbie Marie Phillips,
earned the dean's praise for "three
years of selfless devotion and . . .

dynamic leadership ... to Stanford's
American Indian Community." A
member of the Pembina Chippewa
Tribe and a junior studying psychol
ogy, she was also cited for being an
"empathetic counselor to her peers as
well as a sincere friend."
Six student advisers to the Program
in Human Biology together garnered
awards "for leading us with compas

sion and intelligence into the personal
and social issues raised by AIDS."
Jack Alden, Phyllis Hayes, Beth
Kneeland, David Matthes, Nate Sel
den, Meg Richman and Marivern
Slaveck helped bring the AIDS Chal
lenge Symposium to Stanford.
The 12 recipients were nominated
for the awards by professors, admi
nistrators and students in January.
