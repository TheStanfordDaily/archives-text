# Prof, says nuclear weapons pose greatest health threat
## 
### DANA HAIGHT 
The "major life and health problem of the 20th cen
tury" is the threat posed by nuclear weapons and the
possibility of nuclear war, Herbert Abrams told a
Bechtel International Center audience yesterday.
Abrams, a professor of radiology and member-in
residence of the Stanford Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control, said nothing "could be more
true to the spirit of the Hippocratic oath" than for
physicians to take an active interest in nuclear
proliferation as it relates to world health.
Abrams said his concern about nuclear war led him
to join with colleagues to found the International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War
(IPPNW) in 1980 — an organization that was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize in December. With members
from over 41 nations, IPPNW focuses "on nuclear
weapons and nuclear war to be divorced from all
other political issues," he said.
According to Abrams, the Nobel prize "allows our
voice to be heard better, more clearly, around the
world."
IPPNW attempts to "influence public opinion
by word and deed" and to "emphasize the struggle for
peace as a concern of all people in all countries," he
said.
According to Abrams, the goals of the IPPNW are to
achieve a comprehensive test ban and to affect a freeze

on nuclear development and production of destabiliz
ing weapons.
Changing policy is a difficult task, he said, adding
that it is "only when the American public makes it a
condition for election that individuals come out for the
freeze."
The "pressure must be kept on" administrators and
legislators to work toward international cooperation
and peace, he said.
-Part of this cooperation consists of including devel
oping nations in international dialogue, Abrams said.
"Decisions are being made without true informed con
sent of innocent bystander nations," he said.
Abrams said that in recent years, physicians in de
veloping countries have begun to look beyond immedi
ate, daily needs to long-term threats such as nuclear
holocaust, adding that they "can have a role in deci
sions that affect four billion people."
Present administrators focus on the Soviet Union as
the enemy, but the "weapons themselves are our ad
versary," according to Abrams.
He said some current government officials are "not
interested in parity; they want superiority." Real supe
riority is questionable given the fact that "present sys
tems are not necessarily fully governable," he added.
According to Abrams, the IPPNW looks to educa
tion as a more feasible approach to dealing with the
nuclear dilemma because it "heightens knowleee and
consciousness" regarding nuclear war.
