## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Senate TV is good idea 
### 
The U.S. Senate — several years after the House of
Representatives and several decades after the people
of the United States — has finally entered the
electronic age. Last week, by a vote of 67-21, the Sen
ate agreed to televise its proceedings beginning June 1,
but only on a trial basis.
In commenting on this action, Sen. Lawton Chiles
(D-Fla.) said, "The Senate doesn't work very well. My
gosh if we let people see what's going on here, we've
got to make it work better." This is precisely the point.
Television coverage is a long overdue move which will
have several positive effects. It will help to unveil what
has been called "the cocoon of ancient rules" that of
ten confuses and hinders the Senate from taking ac
tion. Television can also push the Senate to change
several of its procedures which now paralyze the cham
ber. This ability was already revealed this week. The
resolution allowing television in the Senate also in
cluded a change in the Senate rules that would make it
more difficult for members to prolong filibusters which
now can continue almost indefinitely.

The decision to bring television into the Senate
could also have a significant effect on the electoral
process in the United States. It will enable voters to see
how decisions are made in Congress and help to
demystify the legislative process. Television can be
used to provide a greater understanding of national
and international problems and increase voter aware
ness. Ultimately, the televising of Senate proceedings
has the potential of increasing the accountability of the
senators to their constituents as well as voter interest
and participation in electoral politics.
Despite these advantages, however, we must also be
aware of the potential abuses of television by the Sen
ate. On numerous occasions we have seen the power of
the media, and there is the possibility that the senators
will use television for their own advantages and for
purposes of re-election. We hope, however, that this
will not be the outcome of this experiment. Rather
than abusing the televising of Senate proceedings, we
would like the senators to use this opportunity to im
prove the electoral process and the represenative form
of government in the United States.
