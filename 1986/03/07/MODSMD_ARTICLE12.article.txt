## Refugees deserve asylum 
### 
Earlier this quarter the Tuesday Films series showed
the movie, "El Norte," which depicts the plight of a
Guatemalan brother and sister whose parents were mur
dered by a death squad, and who emigrated, surrep
titiously and with great difficulty, to the United States.
The film was meant to portray, through the ordeal of two
young people, the tragedy of an entire region. Thousands
of Salvadorans and Guatemalans have fled and are con
tinuing to flee to this country to escape, not poverty, but
the recurrent political violence which has beset their
homelands. Altogether, more than 80,000 people have
been killed in El Salvador and Guatemala since 1979.

The Reagan Administration does not regard the vast
majority of emigrees from El Salvador and Guatemala as
political refugees. Consequently, aliens from these
countries within the United States live in constant fear of
deportation back to their native countries, with the subse
quent likelihood of torture and death. Amnesty Interna
tional reports that at least one-third of deported Central
American refugees are kidnapped, tortured or murdered
upon their return.
The Reagan Administration has politicized the issue of
asylum. While it deports Salvadoran and Guatemalan
refugees, it liberally allows political asylum to refugees
from Poland, the Soviet Union, Iran, Afghanistan and
Vietnam. The Administration distinguished these
countries, claiming that their citizens are politically perse
cuted while Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees are not.
Apparently President Reagan does not regard mass
murder as political persecution. It is well documented that
Salvadoran and Guatemalan people have been, seemingly
indiscriminately, murdered in large numbers by military
death squads. The distinction which Reagan and the Im
migration and Naturalization Service (INS) have chosen
to draw is morally suspect, to say the least. The Reagan
policy may be interpreted to propound the following
message: If your government deprives you of the right to
vote, or to practice your religion, or to speak freely, or to
own property, then the United States opens its arms to
you as a political asylee, especially if the government
which has persecuted you thus purports to be socialist or
otherwise inimical to the United States. On the other
hand, if your government dispatches helicopters and an
nihilates everyone in your village, you have no justifica
tion in seeking asylum, especially if the government which

has thus acted is on friendly terms with the Reagan Ad
ministration and is a recipient of U.S. military assistance
to support its escapades.
The national Sanctuary movement consists of a largely
disunified coalition of churches, university campuses, in
dividuals and cities which have resolved to oppose the
president's immigration policy. Sanctuary at Stanford
(SAS) is a Stanford student movement dedicated to this
end. Nationally, assistance has ranged from mere sym
bolic support of the refugee's cause, through the declara
tion of a campus or community as a sanctuary from
deportation, to active assistance, such as helping refugees
over the border into the United States and hiding them in
church basements and private homes. SAS is seeking to
have Stanford declared a sanctuary through a student bal
lot during this spring's ASSU election; the ASSU has
unanimously passed a resolution giving its full support to
the initiative of SAS. Currently, SAS is planning other in
termediate modes of assistance such as food drives, oc
cupational training, language and cultural training arid
raising bail money to free incarcerated illegal aliens Miife
they await deportation hearings.
Partisan political concerns are superseded by the simple
fact that large numbers of people are being murdered in
El Salvador and Guatemala. This is the foundation of the
Sanctuary movement's critique of Reagan's asylum policy
and of the willingness of sanctuary workers to flirt with le
gal sanctions to undermine that policy. The Reagan Ad
ministration is not permitting official sanctuary, that is im
munity, from the killing; consequently, private initiative
has become necessary to undertake an urgent task which
the U.S. government refuses to perform.
Underlying the sanctuary issue is the question whether
the American people are going to do everything possible
to save as many of these people as they can. It is irrelevant
whether a refugee fears murder by death squad or by the
cross fire of a civil war, whether a refugee is politically
outspoken or an unsophisticated peasant, or whether the
refugee's government is or is not "pro-American." Con
sideration of such peripheral issues in the granting of safe
haven, which is what the Reagan Administration engages
in, obscures the moral impera.'ve — which is, very suc
cinctly, to save lives.
It is important that Stanford students become aware of
the sanctuary issue and also that they express themselves
on it through the ASSU election this spring. Public outcry
is necessary if we are to effect a change in the current
policy.

Earlier this quarter the Tuesday Films series showed
the movie, "El Norte," which depicts the plight of a
Guatemalan brother and sister whose parents were mur
dered by a death squad, and who emigrated, surrep
titiously and with great difficulty, to the United States.
The film was meant to portray, through the ordeal of two
young people, the tragedy of an entire region. Thousands
of Salvadorans and Guatemalans have fled and are con
tinuing to flee to this country to escape, not poverty, but
the recurrent political violence which has beset their
homelands. Altogether, more than 80,000 people have
been killed in El Salvador and Guatemala since 1979.

The Reagan Administration does not regard the vast
majority of emigrees from El Salvador and Guatemala as
political refugees. Consequently, aliens from these
countries within the United States live in constant fear of
deportation back to their native countries, with the subse
quent likelihood of torture and death. Amnesty Interna
tional reports that at least one-third of deported Central
American refugees are kidnapped, tortured or murdered
upon their return.
The Reagan Administration has politicized the issue of
asylum. While it deports Salvadoran and Guatemalan
refugees, it liberally allows political asylum to refugees
from Poland, the Soviet Union, Iran, Afghanistan and
Vietnam. The Administration distinguished these
countries, claiming that their citizens are politically perse
cuted while Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees are not.
Apparently President Reagan does not regard mass
murder as political persecution. It is well documented that
Salvadoran and Guatemalan people have been, seemingly
indiscriminately, murdered in large numbers by military
death squads. The distinction which Reagan and the Im
migration and Naturalization Service (INS) have chosen
to draw is morally suspect, to say the least. The Reagan
policy may be interpreted to propound the following
message: If your government deprives you of the right to
vote, or to practice your religion, or to speak freely, or to
own property, then the United States opens its arms to
you as a political asylee, especially if the government
which has persecuted you thus purports to be socialist or
otherwise inimical to the United States. On the other
hand, if your government dispatches helicopters and an
nihilates everyone in your village, you have no justifica
tion in seeking asylum, especially if the government which

has thus acted is on friendly terms with the Reagan Ad
ministration and is a recipient of U.S. military assistance
to support its escapades.
The national Sanctuary movement consists of a largely
disunified coalition of churches, university campuses, in
dividuals and cities which have resolved to oppose the
president's immigration policy. Sanctuary at Stanford
(SAS) is a Stanford student movement dedicated to this
end. Nationally, assistance has ranged from mere sym
bolic support of the refugee's cause, through the declara
tion of a campus or community as a sanctuary from
deportation, to active assistance, such as helping refugees
over the border into the United States and hiding them in
church basements and private homes. SAS is seeking to
have Stanford declared a sanctuary through a student bal
lot during this spring's ASSU election; the ASSU has
unanimously passed a resolution giving its full support to
the initiative of SAS. Currently, SAS is planning other in
termediate modes of assistance such as food drives, oc
cupational training, language and cultural training arid
raising bail money to free incarcerated illegal aliens Miife
they await deportation hearings.
Partisan political concerns are superseded by the simple
fact that large numbers of people are being murdered in
El Salvador and Guatemala. This is the foundation of the
Sanctuary movement's critique of Reagan's asylum policy
and of the willingness of sanctuary workers to flirt with le
gal sanctions to undermine that policy. The Reagan Ad
ministration is not permitting official sanctuary, that is im
munity, from the killing; consequently, private initiative
has become necessary to undertake an urgent task which
the U.S. government refuses to perform.
Underlying the sanctuary issue is the question whether
the American people are going to do everything possible
to save as many of these people as they can. It is irrelevant
whether a refugee fears murder by death squad or by the
cross fire of a civil war, whether a refugee is politically
outspoken or an unsophisticated peasant, or whether the
refugee's government is or is not "pro-American." Con
sideration of such peripheral issues in the granting of safe
haven, which is what the Reagan Administration engages
in, obscures the moral impera.'ve — which is, very suc
cinctly, to save lives.
It is important that Stanford students become aware of
the sanctuary issue and also that they express themselves
on it through the ASSU election this spring. Public outcry
is necessary if we are to effect a change in the current
policy.
