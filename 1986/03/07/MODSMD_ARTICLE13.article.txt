# Arrogance common flaw

### 
It's the characteristic I despise most in myself, and in
others as well. And it's one of the few things in life that
genuinely terrifies me. It pervades human interaction; it
subtly entraps people; and, worst of all, it destroys some
of the most cherished aspects of human interaction and
relationships.
"It" is arrogance, the kind of arrogance that leads one
to believe that he is the sole possessor of truth, that his
view is the only "conscious," the only "correct" one, and
that to disagree means not only that the other person is
wrong, but is also profoundly ignorant or ill-intentioned
or both.
This arrogance exists in us all and takes many forms:
narrow-mindedness, self-righteousness, inflated sense of
self-importance, intolerance.

This arrogance tfe exemplified by people's tendency, in a
conversation, to cut the other person' off in mid-sentence,
as if one knows and understands what the other person is
going to say before they say it.
More generally, the tendency to speak rather than listen
reveals the high value we place on our own views and
opinions relative to others', and thereby subtly reflects the
inclination toward arrogance. We value our views more
than others' views; therefore we speak a lot and listen a
little. But only through listening to others can we learn.
This arrogance is what I sense from political activists
who think that if you don't embrace their ideology, it's be
cause you're not conscious or enlightened. Of course, they
do not recognize the possibility that you simply have an
other, equally intelligent, point of view.
This arrogance is what I hear in the voice of some
Christian evangelists who self-righteously demand, "I'm
saved. Are you? Have you accepted Christ as your savior?
Or are you going to Hell with all the rest of these sin
ners?"
This individual arrogance is mirrored in our national ar
rogance, an arrogance according to which the Soviet Un
ion is an "evil empire" (while we, of course, are always on
the side of freedom and .democracy). Far from being
unique to the United States, most nations probably suffer
from this collective arrogance.
This arrogance entraps people; it can take hold of us
without us ever noticing. It's not necessarily the sign of an
evil or bad or even an especially selfish person — but
simply a person who puts too much stock in his own views

and discounts others' opinions.
Ironically, it's when an issue becomes deeply important
to us that our arrogance is most likely to show. With issues
that we think about often and care about deeply — civil
rights, South Africa, the Middle East — we easily lose
sight of the fact that sincerity gives one no privileged
access to truth and understanding.
Arrogance also subtly ensares people in that the more
open-minded of us see this arrogance in others and
foolishly believe ourselves to be above it, thus, making
ourselves vulnerable prey. For example, in castigating a
fellow student for his racist attitudes, one may easily begin
to think of himself as the "authority" on what's racist and
what's not.
Being at Stanford makes us especially likely prey for ar
rogance. Receiving the best education money can buy
promotes in each of us the elitist attitude that our ideas
and opinions are more discerning and of greater value
than those of less educated souls.
Most of all, this arrogance destroys what is best in
human interaction. Ideas, the best of which usually gain
their strength and vitality from the interplay and exchange
of differing opinions and perspectives, die at the alter of
arrogance. In destroying ideas, this arrogance impedes
our growth. It dampens the effect and expression of one of
our marvelously unique human qualities: adaptation and
change through reason..This arrogance signals the infla
tion of one's sense of self-importance as well as a corres
ponding devaluation of others' ideas and opinions. It
creates an insular individual where one's thinking only
feeds upon itself, with no nourishment from the world of
opposing views and ideas. It precludes constructive disa
greement or debate, because the"truth" has already been
grasped and articulated.
This arrogance polarizes us, both as individuals and as
nations. Groups with similar views unite, yet little or no
true communication occurs between groups with differing
views. And the lack of discourse usually exacerbates the
polarization.
It takes restraint and self-awareness to diminish our ar
rogance. Restraint to resist the urge to speak with the au
thority of one speaking the"truth." Self-awareness to rec
ognize the limitations of one's own understanding and
judgment. Even when concerted thought, sincerity and
abundant information go into formulating one's opinion,
that opinion remains just that, one person's opinion, not
the"truth."
We should strive to always allow to linger within us the
humbling thought that "my opinion is only my opinion;
it's not the 'truth' or the only intelligent way to visw or in
terpret a situation."
Most importantly, we must remember that we can be
wrong. As a very open- minded guy I know sa/s, "My
greatest personal growth came when I realize! that I
could be wrong."
