Justice still denied
Let us not forget Victor Hill. Hill, a
United Stanford Workers (USW)
member and University worker for
10 years was unjustly fired for al
legedly slashing Stores Manager Hec
tor Allen s tires. While this may seem
like an isolated incident, it is really
the culmination of several disagree
ments Allen has had with Hill and his
co-workers over the last few years,
concerning Allen's mismanagement
of the Stores operation. It was also
Employee Relations Manager Felix
Barthelemy's attempt to try to
subdue the Stores workers during the
contract negotiations.
In its Oct. 24 editorial. The Daily
asks the Stanford administration to
explain the Hill and Marlena Brous
sard firings (Broussard, who is the
only eyewitness to the incident, was
fired for testifying that Hill is inno
cent). The Daily stated: "Without
this, the University's actions can be
viewed as part of a campaign to
provoke the union and to intimidate
union supporters." To this date no
explanation has been offered by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
We are still waiting! Yes, Don, you
can make a difference.
Under Allen's management, the
Stores operation has steadily
deteriorated over the past two years.
Many customers have complained
about the poor service they receive
from Stores. Our work crew tried
many times to get Allen to correct the

situation but our pleas were ignored.
The result of Allen's mismanagement
has been the loss to Stores of a multi
million dollar account — delivery to
the Stanford Medical Center.
Where is justice? Allen mis
manages Stores and Stanford rewards
him by keeping him employed. Hill, a
long-term employee with a clean
work record, is fired — this despite
the fact that the police refused to ar
rest him for lack of evidence. And, to
compound the mistreatment of Hill,
we have learned from several sources,
that management has been slandering
Hill. They have tried to prevent him
from finding work outside of Stanford
by telling prospective employers that
he was also suspected of theft — a
charge which is untrue and has never
been raised. There will be no justice
until Hill is reinstated.
Remember Victor Hill!

'Noise' needed to
implement change
I thought I'd take a few minutes to
respond to Allen Estes' column
"Make difference, not just noise"
(Daily, March 5). I suggest that Estes,
and everyone at Stanford, read the
article "Dissenting With Dissent," by
Amherst student Ethan Nasreddin in

the winter '86 issue of "In Writing".
He might learn something about the
meaning of what he calls "making
noise."
Estes' criticism of Stanford activists
is, in essence, that he disapproves of
their methods for implementing so
cial or political change. What he fails
to understand is that true change of
the social structures surrounding us
requires some noise and ugliness
(American critics of apartheid hope
for non-violent change in South
Africa, but given the intransigence of
the regime and its history of violence
against blacks, it seems naive to ex
pect no blood to be spilled.) The
methods of volunteerism proposed by
"You Can Make A Difference" —
"student planning, dedication, inno
vation and cooperation help[ing] to
improve the lives of others" — while
friendly, do not and cannot lead to a
better society. They are band-aids for
society's self-inflicted wounds. They
treat symptoms, rather than causes.
Remaining within the bounds of
politeness and aesthetics, as Estes
suggests, means remaining within the
already existing social structures
which are not themselves particularly
beautiful. In fact, those social
structures are much uglier, if really
looked at, than shantytowns on White
Plaza, broken windows in Old Union,
barbed wire, etc. If he looked really
closely at the society around him,
he'd see that it's not about politeness
and high culture alone, but oppres
sion — that, in fact, our high culture

is founded on oppression. If he really
cares about "making a difference," I
suggest Estes take a few minutes to
read and consider Nasreddin's article,
a few of whose points I have touched
on here. Maybe then he'll understand
the value of "noise." And write an
other column about it.

Freshman have
access to singles
Contrary to your feature on single
rooms in Stanford dorms (Daily,
March 3), some freshmen here do live
in singles. Both Branner and Rin
conada have singles reserved for in
coming freshmen.
Students may wonder how the
Stanford Housing Center decides
which freshmen should get their own
rooms. Generally, we try to assign ac
tive and self-reliant freshmen to
singles that have not been reserved
for freshmen with special needs.
Though the propsect of living alone
can be disconcerting to a freshman
looking forward to life with a
roommate, the advantages of a single
room — described well in your article
— should eventually make up for any
disappointment.

Where is justice? Allen mis
manages Stores and Stanford rewards
him by keeping him employed. Hill, a
long-term employee with a clean
work record, is fired — this despite
the fact that the police refused to ar
rest him for lack of evidence. And, to
compound the mistreatment of Hill,
we have learned from several sources,
that management has been slandering
Hill. They have tried to prevent him
from finding work outside of Stanford
by telling prospective employers that
he was also suspected of theft — a
charge which is untrue and has never
been raised. There will be no justice
until Hill is reinstated.
Remember Victor Hill!

'Noise' needed to
implement change
I thought I'd take a few minutes to
respond to Allen Estes' column
"Make difference, not just noise"
(Daily, March 5). I suggest that Estes,
and everyone at Stanford, read the
article "Dissenting With Dissent," by
Amherst student Ethan Nasreddin in

the winter '86 issue of "In Writing".
He might learn something about the
meaning of what he calls "making
noise."
Estes' criticism of Stanford activists
is, in essence, that he disapproves of
their methods for implementing so
cial or political change. What he fails
to understand is that true change of
the social structures surrounding us
requires some noise and ugliness
(American critics of apartheid hope
for non-violent change in South
Africa, but given the intransigence of
the regime and its history of violence
against blacks, it seems naive to ex
pect no blood to be spilled.) The
methods of volunteerism proposed by
"You Can Make A Difference" —
"student planning, dedication, inno
vation and cooperation help[ing] to
improve the lives of others" — while
friendly, do not and cannot lead to a
better society. They are band-aids for
society's self-inflicted wounds. They
treat symptoms, rather than causes.
Remaining within the bounds of
politeness and aesthetics, as Estes
suggests, means remaining within the
already existing social structures
which are not themselves particularly
beautiful. In fact, those social
structures are much uglier, if really
looked at, than shantytowns on White
Plaza, broken windows in Old Union,
barbed wire, etc. If he looked really
closely at the society around him,
he'd see that it's not about politeness
and high culture alone, but oppres
sion — that, in fact, our high culture

is founded on oppression. If he really
cares about "making a difference," I
suggest Estes take a few minutes to
read and consider Nasreddin's article,
a few of whose points I have touched
on here. Maybe then he'll understand
the value of "noise." And write an
other column about it.

Freshman have
access to singles
Contrary to your feature on single
rooms in Stanford dorms (Daily,
March 3), some freshmen here do live
in singles. Both Branner and Rin
conada have singles reserved for in
coming freshmen.
Students may wonder how the
Stanford Housing Center decides
which freshmen should get their own
rooms. Generally, we try to assign ac
tive and self-reliant freshmen to
singles that have not been reserved
for freshmen with special needs.
Though the propsect of living alone
can be disconcerting to a freshman
looking forward to life with a
roommate, the advantages of a single
room — described well in your article
— should eventually make up for any
disappointment.

Justice still denied
Let us not forget Victor Hill. Hill, a
United Stanford Workers (USW)
member and University worker for
10 years was unjustly fired for al
legedly slashing Stores Manager Hec
tor Allen s tires. While this may seem
like an isolated incident, it is really
the culmination of several disagree
ments Allen has had with Hill and his
co-workers over the last few years,
concerning Allen's mismanagement
of the Stores operation. It was also
Employee Relations Manager Felix
Barthelemy's attempt to try to
subdue the Stores workers during the
contract negotiations.
In its Oct. 24 editorial. The Daily
asks the Stanford administration to
explain the Hill and Marlena Brous
sard firings (Broussard, who is the
only eyewitness to the incident, was
fired for testifying that Hill is inno
cent). The Daily stated: "Without
this, the University's actions can be
viewed as part of a campaign to
provoke the union and to intimidate
union supporters." To this date no
explanation has been offered by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
We are still waiting! Yes, Don, you
can make a difference.
Under Allen's management, the
Stores operation has steadily
deteriorated over the past two years.
Many customers have complained
about the poor service they receive
from Stores. Our work crew tried
many times to get Allen to correct the

situation but our pleas were ignored.
The result of Allen's mismanagement
has been the loss to Stores of a multi
million dollar account — delivery to
the Stanford Medical Center.
Where is justice? Allen mis
manages Stores and Stanford rewards
him by keeping him employed. Hill, a
long-term employee with a clean
work record, is fired — this despite
the fact that the police refused to ar
rest him for lack of evidence. And, to
compound the mistreatment of Hill,

from finding work outside of Stanford
