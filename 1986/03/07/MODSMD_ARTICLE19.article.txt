# A 						cursory bite of a Big Mac

### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
This column will be on the Macintosh.
Actually, it already is.
I may be in class right now, or better
yet, in a tacky blue and yellow raft ed
dying across the surface of Lake Lag, but
my words can still have an impact, at least
on the memory of my Sony diskette, if not
on you.
Like many fuzzy freshmen last year, 1
was lured in by the cheap side of The Con
sortium. Before I became mouse-eye
coordinated, 1 thought computer literacy
meant being able to read those awful party
fliers printed in 24-point London.
(There were about 40 Macs in my dorm
of 60 frosh; our house T-shirt was, need
less to say, a Mac Paint masterpiece.)
Now, my Mac 512 and I can crank out a
Mac term paper in one Mac all-nighter, a
feat that would have taken my old Olivetti
portable a wastebasket full of rough drafts
and a weekend's worth of procrastination.
1 think Stanford is particularly suscepti
ble to computerism, a dreaded depen
dency that spreads in academic settings,
concentrating mainly in the technically
oriented populations.
The victim's first symptoms of addiction
are an inseparability from Texas Instru
ments products. Next, the carrier will
become proficient at Lode Runner or
Frogger or more sophisticated games
software for the Mac. In the final,
prolonged phase, the patient is wracked
by intense distain for anything Macintosh;
in fact, anything less than a DEC
mainframe is relegated to the level of the
abacus and the adding machine.
I don't think it's possible to fulfill the
first five distribution requirements in less
than four years any more without access to
a Macintosh. You don't have to believe
me, just go check Meyer. It's harder to
type your paper into a computer there

than to get your laundry into a dryer on a
Saturday morning at Stern.
The off-beige wonder is invading terri
tory that the FTD florist doesn't even
know about.
Macintoshes don't even need the Amer
ican Express Card. You can't help but ac
knowledge something that's more
epidemic than Karl Maiden.
Pretty soon, kids will burn their Crayola
64-packs, protesting for the revised ver
sion of Mac Draw. Moms will love the

toddler version, Mac Scribble On The
Walls.
And they'll play 20 Questions by ask
ing, "Is it bigger than a Fat Mac?" But
then, who ever knew the dimensions of a
bread box, anyway?
1 can just see these kids when they get
into high school. "Um, I'm sorry my
paper's late, Ms. Sludgebottom, but my
printer ate it."
I tried that with my Western Culture
profs; it worked until about halfway

through spring quarter. Someone leaked
the news that once a paper is stored on a
disk, it can be printed out on any friendly
printer in the neighborhood.
That ended a creative period for me.
One week I would create sprocket
psoriasis. The next week my Mac would
fall prey to disk drive depression or
keyboard cramps. We were just hitting the
runny file and stuffy icon season when the
truth blasted on the scene like a fresh
squirt of Dristan.
No, I like my Mac, even though the
name does have greasy-french-fry-stupid
red-haired-clown-suit connotations. I
spend so much time with it, I ought to. I'm
not going to listen to Bio majors com
plaining about their lab fallout when my
face feels like it has Mac Screen Burn, sort
of like Richard Dreyfuss in Close
Encounters.
It has the most polite cursor on the mar
ket, though. That's what 1 look for in a
computer. Although I prefer to think of
the gadgets as glorified typewriters with
all the extras â€” ventilated roof, tinted
CRT, automatic ROM overdrive.
Even the Mac still taps its little cursor
foot while I'm staring off into the im
aginative haze that hangs in front of my
desk, ostensibly renewing my creative
license. There should be a writer's block
override for that little line with the big
voice shouting, "Well? How about it?
Huh? Nothing to say? I've got 36K free,
what are you going to do about it?!"
I don't ask for over-friendly software
packages. I don't ask that it do my taxes
for me or teach me Sanskrit or draw nag
ging pie charts of the time I allot to sleep
ing in class, eating Tresidder pizza and
blowdrying my hair.
All I ask is an extra key wedged some
where between the semi-colon and the
apostrophe, marked by an eye-catching
red K, for KILL CURSOR.
