### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
University administrators yester
day defended the proposed restruc
turing of the Innovative Academic
Courses office (I AC) at a meeting of
the Faculty Senate.
ASSU Senate Chair Carey White
questioned the viability of the
restructuring proposal, citing student
fears of less diversity in academic of
ferings as well as a lack of community
involvement in the reorganization
process.
The lAC currently sponsors
student-organized courses,
such as the Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI).
The proposed restructuring is
credited to Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
Lougee and lAC Faculty Director
Jack Winkler.
Lougee reportedly based the need
for restructuring lAC on a 1984
report by a commission led by Eco
nomics Prof. Kenneth Arrow. The
Arrow Report questioned whether
SWOPSI courses were as "rigorous
and demanding academically" as
other Stanford courses.
Lougee assured White, who is en
titled to attend Faculty Senate
meetings as an ASSU representative,
that student involvement in lAC is
"by no means being eliminated or
reduced" and that the lAC is
"critical" to Stanford undergraduate
education.
According to Lougee, the restruc-

Turing would not alter lACs current
status. "It's not a reorganization of
the program, but a reorganization of
the staff," Lougee said.
All reorganization of the program
itself was completed last year as the
result of a long evaluation process in
conjunction with the Arrow Report,
Lougee said.
According to White, many students
also believe that the new lAC
structure could leave the organiza
tion's student co-director less in
volved in the academic planning
process.
On Monday, lAC Student Coordi
nator Betsy lelliffe cited professional
conflicts between Winkler and the
other non-faculty administrators as
the principal reason behind the
changes. Jellife said Winkler had de
termined the relevance and
legitimacy of proposed SWOPSI
courses without consulting other ad
ministrators.
"It is not the intention (of the
changes) to eliminate the student
staffers' role in course development,"
Lougee said.
University Provost James Rosse
also defended the process used to
consider any program changes. "I do
know that a great deal of thought and
care went into thinking how this
(should) be done," Rosse said.
In other business, the senate ap
proved a new doctoral program in
Italian Literature and a new under
graduate interdisciplinary major in
symbolic systems.
The Ph.D. program in Italian
Literature would take advantage of
recent faculty appointments which
have particularly strengthened Stan
ford's offerings, said Prof. Alphonse
Juilland, chairman of the French and
Italian Department.

According to a report submitted by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, the symbolic systems pro
gram is designed for students inter
ested in"the nature of information
. . . and the ways in which it is pro
cessed by minds and machines."
