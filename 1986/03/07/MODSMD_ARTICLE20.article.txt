## Fugard's 'Master Harold' traces one man's racism 
### PETER MORGAN 
Athol Fugard is a contemporary
playwright in the right place at the
right time. He is a South African
writing dramas about racism, which
means he has become even more
popular in the last two years than
ever before. He is presently acting on
Broadway in a hit production of one
of his own plays, and has recently
been interviewed side-by-side with
Arthur Miller and David Mamet.
Presently, three of his plays are run
ning at various locales in the Bay
Area.
Fugard has said his plays are un
derstandably associated with the
present political turmoil in his
homeland, but that to call him a poli
tical playwright is only limiting the
scope of his work. After seeing
Theatre Works' production of
Fugard's "Master Harold .. . and the
boys," I would agree wholeheartedly
with Fugard. It was a moving perfor
mance, just as much about emotional
maturity as racism.
The play is set in Port Elizabeth,

South Africa in 1950. The scene is a
local tea room and the action focuses
on a rainy afternoon in which the
owner's son, Hally, unveils his previ
ously hidden racism towards the two
shop workers, Sam and Willie.
Hally's racism is not revealed so
much in his interaction with the black
servants, who are, in fact, his closest
friends, but by his anger towards his
father.
The roots of Hally's racism, in fact,
go all the way down to his family's
disintegration, and thus the play is
more than a simple indictment of
apartheid society. It is a play about
intellect vs. emotion. Nothing terribly
new about that, but the particular
image of a clever, pseudo-intellectual
schoolboy "educating" others struck
very close to home in this Stanford
student.
Hally's intellectual maturity is
completely discredited by his childish
emotions. Like most of the white
adults in his society, Hally's intelli
gence has grown much faster than his
emotions. The result is a society run
by children who pout and sulk at the

first sign of unpleasantness, and who
deny the terrible thought that maybe
the people we don't admire are still
the ones we love.
It is also a play about imagination
vs. reality, and here Fugard's skill as a
writer shows strongest. Describing
the many metaphors Fugard uses so
elegantly in the play would ruin their
power, but suffice to say they have
something to do with hope and
cynicism. Again, nothing new here
except Fugard's particular images
that make the dialogue not just a
Shavian banter of ideas, but the state
ments of live human beings as well.
The Theatre Works production
benefits from a solid acting trio
backed up by an absolutely entranc
ing set by John G. Rathman. Rob
Robinson delivers an exceedingly
strong performance as a very wise but
humble black waiter in apartheid so
ciety.
I recommend a short trip to the
Burgess Theater in Menlo Park (15
minutes by bike, students only $6) for
a very stimulating evening.
