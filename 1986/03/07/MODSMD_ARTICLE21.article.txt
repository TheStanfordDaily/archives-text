# Tulsa Ballet dances mix traditional and cute choreography
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
A ballet company from Tulsa? I
was laughed at for buying tickets to
see lulsa Ballet, but my friend who
"knew" ballet swore that the Tulsa
company was one of the best in the
country, following in the footsteps of
the great grandaddy Ballet Russe. I
listened to her, ignoring the posters
that showed two ballet dancers
embracing in a cornfield, and made a
vague allusion to Rogers and Ham
mer stein.
I should have paid attention to
them. Tulsa Ballet is a weird blend of
classicism and cornfield, and the four
dances in Sunday's performance were
an even split. Two of them, "Swan
Lake' and "Gaite Parisienne," were
like everyone's childhood ballet
memory; the other two, unfortun
ately, are barely memorable.
I he company played it safe by
starting with a true classic — "Swan
Lake"— that showed off the techni
cal skill of the dancers. Their inter
pretation was nothing out of the ordi
nary, except that in the beginning and
end of the piece they used strung
together swans moving across the
stage to represent the swan-states of
the dancers; this made the point- of
the ballet perfectly clear for those too
young or too weak-sighted to read
the program, but reminded me, un
fortunately, of a shooting gallery line
of ducks. I couldn't suppress a giggle.
Still, it was a beautiful piece, and
while I was watching it, I was con
vinced that my ballet-aficionado
friend (who had decided to come
along) had been right after all. The

second piece was a recently
choreographed tribute to the native
American called "Rhythmetron,"
and 1 was excited to see what these
expert classical dancers could do with
modern choreograpy.
1 never really found out. The dan
cers kept on dancing, but a thorough
study of "Rythmetron" and the piece
that followed, "The Greatest: The
Kiss," produced no sign of choreog

raphy whatsoever. "Rythmetron"
was really a series of still poses; the
dancers twisted into an admittedely
interesting group of shapes in a list
less and artifical way, pumped along
by a whiny soundtrack that the pro
gram described as "galvinizing."
One or two of the poses produced
gales of applause; good enough, but
in a ballet one expects to hear ap
plause for dancing, not shaped im

mobility. Cliched Indian costumes
and orange lighting didn't help mat
ters; it seemed as if this dance, meant
to be a tribute, was more of an insult
to Indians, or at least a superficial
perception of what it is to be Indian.
My ballet-loving friend was frown
ing by this time. She'd said the Swan
Lake was okay, nothing special, and
now we waited for the Tulsans to
redeem themselves. The lights

dimmed, then brightened, and two
dancers began doing a slow courtship
ritual to a pre-recorded guitar song.
The lyrics, which totally drowned
out the dancers, insisted that
"learning to love yourself was the
greatest love of all." I was
transported instantly back to child
hood, to winters in Madison Square
Garden. "It's Ice Capades," I
whispered to my ballet friend. The

dancers leaned over and gave each
other a shy kiss, then darted light
footed to far corners of the stage — a
few whirls later and they were hack in
each others arms, on bended knees.
The music swelled, and the curtain
dropped.
Over a peanut butter cookie during
intermission, I read that the next
dance, the "Gaite Parisienne," was
"the most popular ballet of our
time." The story of a "typical even
ing" at the Paris cafe, the dance had
all the trappings of a Ballet Russe
performance — lavish costumes, flir
tatious whirling dancers and fast
music.
It was the most spirited of the four
dances, and the one that allowed the
dancers to go through their paces.
The Tulsa company seemed most at
home in silks and velvets, doing high
stepping production numbers that
blurred the line between ballet and
popular dance.
Though the Parisienne was the
longest of all the pieces, it kept my at
tention. The performance was ener
getic enough to alleviate some of the
mushiness I'd felt after the soggy
Benson piece.
1 felt a little guilty for turning up
my nose; if the Oklahomans like a
little cuteness in their ballet, who am
1 to complain? After the perfor
mance, the fountain area in front of
Mem Aud was littered with kids
dancing, doing swirls and pirouettes
and high kicks. They might be better
judges of Tulsa Ballet than I am —
but if you don't like cute, be warned.
Rogers and Hammerstein are a hard
act to follow.
