Brazil (1985)
Stanford Theatre, Palo Alto
Terry Gilliam's almost unreleased
comedy is a visually astounding,
slapstick monstrousity. Set in an un
specified totalitarian future, the
movie follows Ministry of Informa
tion toady Sam Lowry (Jonathon
Pryce) in his quasi-revolt against the
behemouth bureacracy he works for.
The movie is constructed around
over-blown sight gags and concep
tual jokes in the spirit and style of
Gilliam's Monty Python animation,
but what makes it all special is Gil
liam's prodigious visual imagination.
His future world is Art Deco Ocay
on a grand scale, inspired by heavy
metal sci-fi, 1940s cartoon sur
realism, "Metropolis," "Blade Run
ner" and other influences. The
comedy is large-scale and
dehumanized, much like Speilberg's
1 "1941," but a few performers —
notably Robert DeNiro, Ian Holm
and Katherine Helmond — make an
impression. Gilliam co-authored the
screenplay, with Harold Pinter and
Charles McKeown.
Plays this week.
Down and Out in Beverly Hills
(1986)
Century 10, Mountain View
i This charming class comedy takes
off from Jean Renoir's "Boudo
Saved From Drowning," and
transplants the action into swank
Beverly Hills. Mangy bum Jerry
Baskin (Nick Nolte) attempts
suicide in the swimming pool of the
Whitemans — a staid, dissatisfied,
nouveau riche California family; he
is rescued, taken in by the family,
and begins acting as a primal force in
their white-washed environment.
The movie treads an uneasy line be
tween all-out satire and humanistic
comedy, and the dog jokes and
comic running around wear a little
thin, but director Paul Mazursky and
screenwriter Leon Capetanos do a
great job of capturing the
precarious, profoundly superficial
mental state of the Whitemans. The
situations are so comically ripe in the
first half of the movie that the occa
sionally weak pay-offs are a definite
letdown in the last half. Overall,
though, it's a lot of fun, and
Mazursky has assembled a great
cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Bette Midler
and Nolte in the major roles, and
Donald Munich, Tracy Nelson, Evan
Richards and Little Richard.

The General (1926)
Cubberly Auditorium
James Agee wrote of Buster
keaton, "He used this great, sad,
motionless face to suggest various
related things: a one track mind near
the track's end of pure insanity;
mulish imperturbability under the
wildest of circumstances; how dead a
human being can get and still be
alive; an awe-inspiring sort of pa
tience and power to endure, proper
to granite but uncanny in flesh and
blood." "The General" is possibly
the greatest of all silent comedies.
Keaton plays a trainman during the
Civil War, and Marion Mack, whose
marionette-like solemnity is an ideal
match for his poker face, stars oppo
site him. The gags are masterfully
calculated; they operate like
amazing, intricate clockwork. And
the look of the film is, along with
"The Birth of a Nation," the closest
movies have ever gotten to
Remington's paintings.
Plays tonight with "The Gold
Rush." ]

The Seven Samurai (1954)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spectacu
lar adventure, set amiu the civil wars
in 16th century Japan. A community
of farmers, slowly starving under the
double burden of land taxes and the
raids of brigands, hires a samurai to
protect them, and swords really start
to fly. The characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the actors
(Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura,
\oshio Inaba, etc.) give stylized per
formances reminiscent of the silent
comedies (though they have their
origin in Kabuki theatre). The real
star, of course, is Kurosawa, who
displays the kind of witty mastery of
film technique that makes audiences
grin.
Plays Thursday.

Beauty and the Beast (1946)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Jean Cocteau directs what is per
haps the greatest of all fairy tale
films. Josette Day, appropriately, is
Beauty, and Jean Marais is her su
perb Beast. His castle, with live
heads in has-relief on the walls and
hands that grow out of tables to pour
wine for his guests, is a cross be
tween Gustave Dore and Salvador
Dali.
Plays Thursday with "Orpheus."

The Gold Rush (1925)
Cubberly Auditorium
Charlie Chaplin's justly famous
comedy, in which he plays a
prospector who seeks his fortune in
Alaska, with Mack Swain as the vil
lian and Georgia Hale as the dance
hall girl, as well as Tom Murray,
Henry Bergman, Malcolm Waite
and Betty Morrissey. The scene in
which Chaplin boils and eats his
shoe is one of the most remarkable
(and delicate) examples of physical
comedy ever photographed.
Plays tonight with "The General."

Utu(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An exhilarating movie about the
Maori uprisings in the 1870s by the
New Zealand director Geoff
Murphy, filmed with as much gran
deur as wit. Murphy, who co
authored the script with Keith
Aberdein, has a bristling intelli
gence; as he introduces more and
more characters, intriguing parallels
appear and new layers of meaning
gather. Anzac Wallace plays Te
Wheke, a Maori who, returning
from a stint with the British Army,
finds his village razed to the ground
and his family slaughtered by British
officers. He declares a private war
on the "pakeha" (the Maori term for
the English ruling class) and, an im
mensely charismatic figure, he or
chestrates it into a political
movement. Murphy can be lyrical
and humorous at the same time; his
gifts for imagery and irony comple
ment each other. He and his photog
rapher, Graeme Cowley, film scenes
of riding and shooting that are the
best of their kind since "The Long
Riders," but Murphy doesn't think
in epic terms. He centers the picture
on his actors, employing them as
dramatic (and visual) anchors. And
he has a terrific cast, all of them rich
camera subjects: Wallace, Bruno
Lawrence, Tania Bristowe, Wi Kuki
Kaa.
Plays tonight through Tuesday.

Yojimbo (1961)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
The opening scene of Akira
Kurosawa's 21st movie is a tribute to
American Westerns ("High Noon"
in particular): Sanjuro (Toshiru
Mifune) stalks bravely up and down
the street of a small town while
everyone else hides. But Kurosawa
charges this scene, and indeed the
whole movie, with his own auda
cious blend of comedy and horror —
a dog trots indifferently through the
street carrying a human hand in its
mouth. This hilarious mock-Western
about a mercenary in mid- 19th cen
tury Japan who hires himself out to
the terrified men on both sides of a
civil war ("Yojimbo" means "the
bodyguard") influenced Sergio
Leone's spaghetti Westerns and pos
sibly Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" as well (both Kurosawa and
Penn mix comedy and violence, and
arrive at surprising results). And in
turn it was influenced by Ford and
Hawks — though what is most en
tertaining about "Yojimbo" are the
ways in which Kurosawa reverses
our Western-fed expectations. San
juro is the only man of courage on
the screen; the others are frightened,
ineffectual insects. Appropriately,
Toshiro Mifune underplays skillfully
while all the other actors (Eijiro
Tono, Kamatari Fujiwata, Takashi
Shimura, Seizaburo Kawazu, Isuzu
Yamada) do wildly funny bur
lesques, their faces frozen in pain
and anger like gargoyles.
Photographed by Kazuo Miyagawa;
music by Masaru Sato.
Plays Sunday with "Rashomon."

The Stunt Man (1980)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
The theme is the old favorite
about reality and fantasy, but the
movie is brand new; a great Ameri
can adventure-comedy that is
layered in a strikingly unusual way.
The plot concerns a mysterious out
law (Steve Railsback, a talented
young actor) who becomes a stunt
man under extraordinary circum
stances. The movie, written by
Lawrence B. Marcus and Richard
Rush and directed by Rush, is a se
ries of reversals of the audience's ex
pectations and the expectations of
the outlaw. Peter O'Toole is won
derful as the director, Eli Cross: out
rageously theatrical, audaciously
self-mocking, thoroughly self
delighted. With Barbra Hershey,
Chuck Bail, Allen Garfield and Alex
Rocco.
Plays Tuesday with "Creator."

The Gold Rush (1925)
Cubberly Auditorium
Charlie Chaplin's justly famous
comedy, in which he plays a
prospector who seeks his fortune in
Alaska, with Mack Swain as the vil
lian and Georgia Hale as the dance
hall girl, as well as Tom Murray,
Henry Bergman, Malcolm Waite
and Betty Morrissey. The scene in
which Chaplin boils and eats his
shoe is one of the most remarkable
(and delicate) examples of physical
comedy ever photographed.
Plays tonight with "The General."

Utu(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An exhilarating movie about the
Maori uprisings in the 1870s by the
New Zealand director Geoff
Murphy, filmed with as much gran
deur as wit. Murphy, who co
authored the script with Keith
Aberdein, has a bristling intelli
gence; as he introduces more and
more characters, intriguing parallels
appear and new layers of meaning
gather. Anzac Wallace plays Te
Wheke, a Maori who, returning
from a stint with the British Army,
finds his village razed to the ground
and his family slaughtered by British
officers. He declares a private war
on the "pakeha" (the Maori term for
the English ruling class) and, an im
mensely charismatic figure, he or
chestrates it into a political
movement. Murphy can be lyrical
and humorous at the same time; his
gifts for imagery and irony comple
ment each other. He and his photog
rapher, Graeme Cowley, film scenes
of riding and shooting that are the
best of their kind since "The Long
Riders," but Murphy doesn't think
in epic terms. He centers the picture
on his actors, employing them as
dramatic (and visual) anchors. And
he has a terrific cast, all of them rich
camera subjects: Wallace, Bruno
Lawrence, Tania Bristowe, Wi Kuki
Kaa.
Plays tonight through Tuesday.

Yojimbo (1961)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
The opening scene of Akira
Kurosawa's 21st movie is a tribute to
American Westerns ("High Noon"
in particular): Sanjuro (Toshiru
Mifune) stalks bravely up and down
the street of a small town while
everyone else hides. But Kurosawa
charges this scene, and indeed the
whole movie, with his own auda
cious blend of comedy and horror —
a dog trots indifferently through the
street carrying a human hand in its
mouth. This hilarious mock-Western
about a mercenary in mid- 19th cen
tury Japan who hires himself out to
the terrified men on both sides of a
civil war ("Yojimbo" means "the
bodyguard") influenced Sergio
Leone's spaghetti Westerns and pos
sibly Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" as well (both Kurosawa and
Penn mix comedy and violence, and
arrive at surprising results). And in
turn it was influenced by Ford and
Hawks — though what is most en
tertaining about "Yojimbo" are the
ways in which Kurosawa reverses
our Western-fed expectations. San
juro is the only man of courage on
the screen; the others are frightened,
ineffectual insects. Appropriately,
Toshiro Mifune underplays skillfully
while all the other actors (Eijiro
Tono, Kamatari Fujiwata, Takashi
Shimura, Seizaburo Kawazu, Isuzu
Yamada) do wildly funny bur
lesques, their faces frozen in pain
and anger like gargoyles.
Photographed by Kazuo Miyagawa;
music by Masaru Sato.
Plays Sunday with "Rashomon."

The Stunt Man (1980)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
The theme is the old favorite
about reality and fantasy, but the
movie is brand new; a great Ameri
can adventure-comedy that is
layered in a strikingly unusual way.
The plot concerns a mysterious out
law (Steve Railsback, a talented
young actor) who becomes a stunt
man under extraordinary circum
stances. The movie, written by
Lawrence B. Marcus and Richard
Rush and directed by Rush, is a se
ries of reversals of the audience's ex
pectations and the expectations of
the outlaw. Peter O'Toole is won
derful as the director, Eli Cross: out
rageously theatrical, audaciously
self-mocking, thoroughly self
delighted. With Barbra Hershey,
Chuck Bail, Allen Garfield and Alex
Rocco.
Plays Tuesday with "Creator."

Brazil (1985)
Stanford Theatre, Palo Alto
Terry Gilliam's almost unreleased
comedy is a visually astounding,
slapstick monstrousity. Set in an un
specified totalitarian future, the
movie follows Ministry of Informa
tion toady Sam Lowry (Jonathon
Pryce) in his quasi-revolt against the
behemouth bureacracy he works for.
The movie is constructed around
over-blown sight gags and concep
tual jokes in the spirit and style of
Gilliam's Monty Python animation,
but what makes it all special is Gil
liam's prodigious visual imagination.
His future world is Art Deco Ocay
on a grand scale, inspired by heavy
metal sci-fi, 1940s cartoon sur
realism, "Metropolis," "Blade Run
ner" and other influences. The
comedy is large-scale and
dehumanized, much like Speilberg's
1 "1941," but a few performers —
notably Robert DeNiro, Ian Holm
and Katherine Helmond — make an
impression. Gilliam co-authored the
screenplay, with Harold Pinter and
Charles McKeown.
Plays this week.
Down and Out in Beverly Hills
(1986)
Century 10, Mountain View
i This charming class comedy takes
off from Jean Renoir's "Boudo
Saved From Drowning," and
transplants the action into swank
Beverly Hills. Mangy bum Jerry
Baskin (Nick Nolte) attempts
suicide in the swimming pool of the
Whitemans — a staid, dissatisfied,
nouveau riche California family; he
is rescued, taken in by the family,
and begins acting as a primal force in
their white-washed environment.
The movie treads an uneasy line be
tween all-out satire and humanistic
comedy, and the dog jokes and
comic running around wear a little
thin, but director Paul Mazursky and
screenwriter Leon Capetanos do a
great job of capturing the
precarious, profoundly superficial
mental state of the Whitemans. The
situations are so comically ripe in the
first half of the movie that the occa
sionally weak pay-offs are a definite
letdown in the last half. Overall,
though, it's a lot of fun, and
Mazursky has assembled a great
cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Bette Midler
and Nolte in the major roles, and
Donald Munich, Tracy Nelson, Evan
Richards and Little Richard.
Plays this week.

The General (1926)
Cubberly Auditorium
James Agee wrote of Buster
keaton, "He used this great, sad,
motionless face to suggest various
related things: a one track mind near
the track's end of pure insanity;
mulish imperturbability under the
wildest of circumstances; how dead a
human being can get and still be
alive; an awe-inspiring sort of pa
tience and power to endure, proper
to granite but uncanny in flesh and
blood." "The General" is possibly
the greatest of all silent comedies.
Keaton plays a trainman during the
Civil War, and Marion Mack, whose
marionette-like solemnity is an ideal
match for his poker face, stars oppo
site him. The gags are masterfully
calculated; they operate like
amazing, intricate clockwork. And
the look of the film is, along with
"The Birth of a Nation," the closest
movies have ever gotten to
Remington's paintings.

The Seven Samurai (1954)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spectacu

in 16th century Japan. A community
of farmers, slowly starving under the
double burden of land taxes and the
raids of brigands, hires a samurai to
protect them, and swords really start
to fly. The characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the actors
(Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura,
\oshio Inaba, etc.) give stylized per
formances reminiscent of the silent
comedies (though they have their
origin in Kabuki theatre). The real
star, of course, is Kurosawa, who

comedy is a visually astounding,
slapstick monstrousity. Set in an un
specified totalitarian future, the
movie follows Ministry of Informa
tion toady Sam Lowry (Jonathon
Pryce) in his quasi-revolt against the
behemouth bureacracy he works for.
The movie is constructed around
over-blown sight gags and concep
tual jokes in the spirit and style of
Gilliam's Monty Python animation,
but what makes it all special is Gil
liam's prodigious visual imagination.
His future world is Art Deco Ocay
on a grand scale, inspired by heavy
metal sci-fi, 1940s cartoon sur
realism, "Metropolis," "Blade Run
ner" and other influences. The
comedy is large-scale and
dehumanized, much like Speilberg's
1 "1941," but a few performers —
notably Robert DeNiro, Ian Holm
and Katherine Helmond — make an
impression. Gilliam co-authored the
screenplay, with Harold Pinter and
Charles McKeown.

Down and Out in Beverly Hills
(1986)
Century 10, Mountain View
i This charming class comedy takes
off from Jean Renoir's "Boudo
Saved From Drowning," and
transplants the action into swank
Beverly Hills. Mangy bum Jerry
Baskin (Nick Nolte) attempts
suicide in the swimming pool of the
Whitemans — a staid, dissatisfied,
nouveau riche California family; he
is rescued, taken in by the family,
and begins acting as a primal force in
their white-washed environment.
The movie treads an uneasy line be
tween all-out satire and humanistic
comedy, and the dog jokes and
comic running around wear a little
thin, but director Paul Mazursky and
screenwriter Leon Capetanos do a
great job of capturing the
precarious, profoundly superficial
mental state of the Whitemans. The
situations are so comically ripe in the
first half of the movie that the occa
sionally weak pay-offs are a definite
letdown in the last half. Overall,
though, it's a lot of fun, and
Mazursky has assembled a great
cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Bette Midler
and Nolte in the major roles, and
Donald Munich, Tracy Nelson, Evan
Richards and Little Richard.

The General (1926)
Cubberly Auditorium
James Agee wrote of Buster
keaton, "He used this great, sad,
motionless face to suggest various
related things: a one track mind near
the track's end of pure insanity;
mulish imperturbability under the
wildest of circumstances; how dead a
human being can get and still be
alive; an awe-inspiring sort of pa
tience and power to endure, proper
to granite but uncanny in flesh and
blood." "The General" is possibly
the greatest of all silent comedies.
Keaton plays a trainman during the
Civil War, and Marion Mack, whose
marionette-like solemnity is an ideal
match for his poker face, stars oppo
site him. The gags are masterfully
calculated; they operate like
amazing, intricate clockwork. And
the look of the film is, along with
"The Birth of a Nation," the closest
movies have ever gotten to
Remington's paintings.
Plays tonight with "The Gold
Rush." ]

The Seven Samurai (1954)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Akira Kurosawa's lusty, spectacu
lar adventure, set amiu the civil wars
in 16th century Japan. A community
of farmers, slowly starving under the
double burden of land taxes and the
raids of brigands, hires a samurai to
protect them, and swords really start
to fly. The characters have a funny,
foolish braggadocio, and the actors
(Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura,
\oshio Inaba, etc.) give stylized per
formances reminiscent of the silent
comedies (though they have their
origin in Kabuki theatre). The real
star, of course, is Kurosawa, who
displays the kind of witty mastery of
film technique that makes audiences
grin.
Plays Thursday.

Beauty and the Beast (1946)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Jean Cocteau directs what is per
haps the greatest of all fairy tale
films. Josette Day, appropriately, is
Beauty, and Jean Marais is her su
perb Beast. His castle, with live
heads in has-relief on the walls and
hands that grow out of tables to pour
wine for his guests, is a cross be
tween Gustave Dore and Salvador
Dali.
Plays Thursday with "Orpheus."

The Gold Rush (1925)
Cubberly Auditorium
Charlie Chaplin's justly famous
comedy, in which he plays a
prospector who seeks his fortune in
Alaska, with Mack Swain as the vil
lian and Georgia Hale as the dance
hall girl, as well as Tom Murray,
Henry Bergman, Malcolm Waite
and Betty Morrissey. The scene in
which Chaplin boils and eats his
shoe is one of the most remarkable
(and delicate) examples of physical
comedy ever photographed.
Plays tonight with "The General."

Utu(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An exhilarating movie about the
Maori uprisings in the 1870s by the
New Zealand director Geoff
Murphy, filmed with as much gran
deur as wit. Murphy, who co
authored the script with Keith
Aberdein, has a bristling intelli
gence; as he introduces more and
more characters, intriguing parallels
appear and new layers of meaning
gather. Anzac Wallace plays Te
Wheke, a Maori who, returning
from a stint with the British Army,
finds his village razed to the ground
and his family slaughtered by British
officers. He declares a private war
on the "pakeha" (the Maori term for
the English ruling class) and, an im
mensely charismatic figure, he or
chestrates it into a political
movement. Murphy can be lyrical
and humorous at the same time; his
gifts for imagery and irony comple
ment each other. He and his photog
rapher, Graeme Cowley, film scenes
of riding and shooting that are the
best of their kind since "The Long
Riders," but Murphy doesn't think
in epic terms. He centers the picture
on his actors, employing them as
dramatic (and visual) anchors. And
he has a terrific cast, all of them rich
camera subjects: Wallace, Bruno
Lawrence, Tania Bristowe, Wi Kuki
Kaa.
Plays tonight through Tuesday.

Yojimbo (1961)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
The opening scene of Akira
Kurosawa's 21st movie is a tribute to
American Westerns ("High Noon"
in particular): Sanjuro (Toshiru
Mifune) stalks bravely up and down
the street of a small town while
everyone else hides. But Kurosawa
charges this scene, and indeed the
whole movie, with his own auda
cious blend of comedy and horror —
a dog trots indifferently through the
street carrying a human hand in its
mouth. This hilarious mock-Western
about a mercenary in mid- 19th cen
tury Japan who hires himself out to
the terrified men on both sides of a
civil war ("Yojimbo" means "the
bodyguard") influenced Sergio
Leone's spaghetti Westerns and pos
sibly Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" as well (both Kurosawa and
Penn mix comedy and violence, and
arrive at surprising results). And in
turn it was influenced by Ford and
Hawks — though what is most en
tertaining about "Yojimbo" are the
ways in which Kurosawa reverses
our Western-fed expectations. San
juro is the only man of courage on
the screen; the others are frightened,
ineffectual insects. Appropriately,
Toshiro Mifune underplays skillfully
while all the other actors (Eijiro
Tono, Kamatari Fujiwata, Takashi
Shimura, Seizaburo Kawazu, Isuzu
Yamada) do wildly funny bur
lesques, their faces frozen in pain
and anger like gargoyles.
Photographed by Kazuo Miyagawa;
music by Masaru Sato.
Plays Sunday with "Rashomon."

The Stunt Man (1980)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
The theme is the old favorite
about reality and fantasy, but the
movie is brand new; a great Ameri
can adventure-comedy that is
layered in a strikingly unusual way.
The plot concerns a mysterious out
law (Steve Railsback, a talented
young actor) who becomes a stunt
man under extraordinary circum
stances. The movie, written by
Lawrence B. Marcus and Richard
Rush and directed by Rush, is a se
ries of reversals of the audience's ex
pectations and the expectations of
the outlaw. Peter O'Toole is won
derful as the director, Eli Cross: out
rageously theatrical, audaciously
self-mocking, thoroughly self
delighted. With Barbra Hershey,
Chuck Bail, Allen Garfield and Alex
Rocco.
Plays Tuesday with "Creator."
