## Cosmos sandwiches anything but spacey

Captain Cosmo's

(415) 322-8222
It could be the name of a trendy
new spot to satiate one's social as well
as dietary needs, or it could be pizza
delivery by parachute, but it is nei
ther.
Instead a flashy name like Captain
Cosmo's identifies a very down-home
submarine sandwich shop. Neither
the food nor the atmosphere is "out
of this world," but then they were not
intended to be. Simple, but good, is
the general theme here.
The menu at Captain Cosmos, lo
cated in downtown Palo Alto, sports
solely sandwiches. Furthermore, the
cuisine speaks primarily to the car
nivore. There is no salad nicoise or
pasta primavera to be found here, but
how about a meatball sandwich with
tomato sauce? Or, what about a hot
Italian sausage sandwich to satisfy
your desire? The food here is
guaranteed to please any "meat and
potatoes man" craving for a good
lunch.
The main attraction is The New
Captain Cosmo. It is composed of
thinly sliced sirloin steak, grilled
onions, bell peppers and mushrooms
— all decadently covered with melted
mozzarella and provolone.
The (old?) Captain Cosmo, a
simpler edition, has only the sirloin
steak, onions and provolone. Evident
by the satisfied munching of those
around me as well as my companion,
these sandwiches left little to be
desired. Even if one doesn't order the
sandwich, the aroma of the steak and
onions being grilled carries far.
The submarine and steak sand
wiches, hearty in content, also come
in hearty sizes of seven and nine
inches, more than enough for even
the heartiest of eaters. The nine
inchers are named, appropriately,
Super Subs and come with the added

bonus of membership in Captain
Cosmo's Super Sub Club.
This membership provides the
proud owner with a special card, kept
on file by the cash register. Each time
a member purchases a Super Sub, the
cashier punches a hole in the card.
After only 11 Super Subs, the mem
ber receives one similar sandwich free
of charge. After three of cards have
been punched to the maximum, it's
probably safe to assume that you've
consumed an entire side of beef!
One thing Captain Cosmos' menu
is not, however, is diverse. Beyond
the realm of sandwiches — and there
are many from which to choose — the
restaurant's offerings are woefully
bare.
What it does offer is a green salad,
potato salad, soup and homemade
desserts. Unfortunately, these things
don't live up to the same reputation
as the Cosmo sub. Any sort of contact
with the potato salad is bound to be
scary. It reminds one of the reason
that normal humans do not enjoy
saltless and cold mashed potatoes.
Beware!
On the other hand, soup and green
salad are generally hard to destroy —
so go ahead and try it if you really
want to.
There is a limited selection of
desserts; you will find as much as they
can get under one plastic cake cover.
Although the treats looked good, it
would be quite a lunchtime ac
complishment to finish an entire Cap
tain Cosmo sub and then eat dessert.
Like the food, the atmosphere is
homey. It is perhaps one of the few
places brave enough to use multi
colored plastic burger baskets in Palo
Alto. In addition, it is fairly small.
Now if you go and you're excited to
tell all your friends about it, Captain
Cosmo's is very willing to, literally,
cater to you. They make two- to six
foot submarine sandwiches, ranging
in price from $13.50 to $42.50.
The service is friendly, the food is
good and the people who eat here
don't eat sushi.
