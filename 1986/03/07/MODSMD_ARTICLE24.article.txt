Stanford Eating Club

Palo Alto

Atmosphere. You can't buy it. Downtown
Palo Alto certainly doesn't have it. Dim light
ing, stale air, crude graffiti scrawled on the
tables — now that's a college pub, the one we
see in the movies and read about in college
books. Granted, we've got the Goose, and the
Oasis, but they don't really fit the bill. Besides,
if you follow the law (and who doesn't?) you
can't even set foot in the door until you're about
to graduate anyway.
So what we need is a place that serves food,
that all students can go to, that's darker than the
Creamery and safer than Antonio's Nut House
and serves real food, not gourmet food, but real
food, the heartburn kind. Right? Enter the
Stanford Eating Club.
The Club, which opened last week, is situated
right across from the Good Earth, on Emerson,
in what used to be one of Palo Alto's bizarre le
gal gambling halls. Peter Gerra, who also owned
the Cool Licks yogurt parlor next door, bought
it with the intention of creating a Stanford icon.
The place looks like it just opened — not that
it's sunny and shiny, like most Palo Alto restau
rants that keep their just-opened look until they
go bankrupt. Actually, it's still largely un
derrated. Gerra has to become a bit more liq
uid before he can finish things up; as a result,
some tables don't have chairs, a mirrored wall
has no mirror on it, and the other walls have
nothing on them but dark Cardinal paint. Gerra
says that what he eventually wants to do is cover
"every inch of the place" with Stanford
memorabilia, and he's soliciting donations, but
hell, atmosphere takes time.
The menu is pretty basic: hamburgers, salads,
pizza and a Philly steak sandwich. The prices
are far lower than the Creamery, though not the
lowest in the area.
Service was great: our house salad ($2.25),
came almost as soon as we It was huge
— not Good Earth pretty, but it had the essen

tial lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, mushrooms
and even hard-boiled eggs. The two of us could
barely finish one salad.
The garlic bread ($1.50), which followed
soon after, was also a generous portion — about
half of a baguette split, covered with garlic and
slices of cheese and butter. It wasn't crisp, but it
was the best garlic bread I've had recently.
The Philly sandwich ($4.25) was oddly served
— there was a heap of meat next to the sand
wich, as well as between the slices of bread. This
* *11 KraoH tr\ Ko«ip hppn
a bit crisper, because steak and onions are a
greasy thing to eat and the whole sandwich was
a bit soft.
If you like thick, soft crust and lots of cheese,
you'll like this pizza. There could have been a
little more sauce on the stromboli piece, but
there was more than enough meat on top. The
Eating Club sells individual slices as well as pies
— the "combination" slices ($2.25) are made
by taking cooked cheese pizza slices ($1.30),
adding topping to the cooked pizza and reheat
ing; entire pizzas have a little more homogeneity.
There are 13 different toppings — a good mix
— and thankfully they don't have pineapple.
The spaghetti ($3.75 a la carte, $5.25 with
garlic bread and salad) was just like Momma
makes it, with plenty of meat in the sauce. Un
fortunately, Momma let the noodles get a little
cold before scooping on the sauce, and the
result was lukewarm. The salad that comes with
the pasta dinners isn't as big as the house salad,
but it's respectable.
There's nothing strictly Veggie (except the
Veggie pizza), but if you want something a little
less greasy, there are four variations on the huge
house salad: seafood, spinach, Cobb (chef) and
Chinese chicken. And if you don't get enough
food (unlikely) there are side orders of french
fries and fried zucchini.
The only Stanford aspect of the menu is that
two things — your basic hamburger ($3.20) and a
combination pizza are named the Cardinal. But
what's in a name? Actually, perhaps much of
the anticipated success of the Stanford Eating
Club. Maybe it doesn't have atmosphere just
yet, but give it time. The Good Earth certainly
won't season as well with age.

Palo Alto
321-2224
Atmosphere. You can't buy it. Downtown
Palo Alto certainly doesn't have it. Dim light
ing, stale air, crude graffiti scrawled on the
tables — now that's a college pub, the one we
see in the movies and read about in college
books. Granted, we've got the Goose, and the
Oasis, but they don't really fit the bill. Besides,
if you follow the law (and who doesn't?) you
can't even set foot in the door until you're about
to graduate anyway.
So what we need is a place that serves food,
that all students can go to, that's darker than the
Creamery and safer than Antonio's Nut House
and serves real food, not gourmet food, but real
food, the heartburn kind. Right? Enter the
Stanford Eating Club.
The Club, which opened last week, is situated
right across from the Good Earth, on Emerson,
in what used to be one of Palo Alto's bizarre le
gal gambling halls. Peter Gerra, who also owned
the Cool Licks yogurt parlor next door, bought
it with the intention of creating a Stanford icon.
The place looks like it just opened — not that
it's sunny and shiny, like most Palo Alto restau
rants that keep their just-opened look until they
go bankrupt. Actually, it's still largely un
derrated. Gerra has to become a bit more liq
uid before he can finish things up; as a result,
some tables don't have chairs, a mirrored wall
has no mirror on it, and the other walls have
nothing on them but dark Cardinal paint. Gerra
says that what he eventually wants to do is cover
"every inch of the place" with Stanford
memorabilia, and he's soliciting donations, but
hell, atmosphere takes time.
The menu is pretty basic: hamburgers, salads,
pizza and a Philly steak sandwich. The prices
are far lower than the Creamery, though not the
lowest in the area.
Service was great: our house salad ($2.25),
came almost as soon as we It was huge
— not Good Earth pretty, but it had the essen

tial lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, mushrooms
and even hard-boiled eggs. The two of us could
barely finish one salad.
The garlic bread ($1.50), which followed
soon after, was also a generous portion — about
half of a baguette split, covered with garlic and
slices of cheese and butter. It wasn't crisp, but it
was the best garlic bread I've had recently.
The Philly sandwich ($4.25) was oddly served
— there was a heap of meat next to the sand
wich, as well as between the slices of bread. This

a bit crisper, because steak and onions are a
greasy thing to eat and the whole sandwich was
a bit soft.
If you like thick, soft crust and lots of cheese,
you'll like this pizza. There could have been a
little more sauce on the stromboli piece, but
there was more than enough meat on top. The
Eating Club sells individual slices as well as pies
— the "combination" slices ($2.25) are made
by taking cooked cheese pizza slices ($1.30),
adding topping to the cooked pizza and reheat
ing; entire pizzas have a little more homogeneity.
There are 13 different toppings — a good mix
— and thankfully they don't have pineapple.
The spaghetti ($3.75 a la carte, $5.25 with
garlic bread and salad) was just like Momma
makes it, with plenty of meat in the sauce. Un
fortunately, Momma let the noodles get a little
cold before scooping on the sauce, and the
result was lukewarm. The salad that comes with
the pasta dinners isn't as big as the house salad,
but it's respectable.
There's nothing strictly Veggie (except the
Veggie pizza), but if you want something a little
less greasy, there are four variations on the huge
house salad: seafood, spinach, Cobb (chef) and
Chinese chicken. And if you don't get enough
food (unlikely) there are side orders of french
fries and fried zucchini.
The only Stanford aspect of the menu is that
two things — your basic hamburger ($3.20) and a
combination pizza are named the Cardinal. But
what's in a name? Actually, perhaps much of
the anticipated success of the Stanford Eating
Club. Maybe it doesn't have atmosphere just
yet, but give it time. The Good Earth certainly
won't season as well with age.
