# Mendocino offers cozy places to spend a relaxing weekend

### JEFFREY MALTZMAN MacCallum House JOHN SAGE Joshua Grindle House 
While scouring the state for great vacation spots, we
stumbled upon two smalt bed and breakfast inns which
deserved an article all to themselves. As veterans of many
large, impersonal hotels, we have always had a soft spot for
small, family owned, bed and breakfast inns.

MacCallum House is a sparkling Victorian mansion lo
cated in the heart of historic downtown Mendocino. The
house offers eight rooms in the main house, along with
several cottages, and a selection of accommodations in a
nearby barn and water tower.
All the rooms have authentic antique fixtures and fur
nishings. Seven of the rooms have private baths, while the
rest share community baths.
Rvery morning, guests of MacCallum House gather in
the parlor for a delicious breakfast of fresh rolls, cereal
fruit and juices in front of a warm fireplace. Daily
newspapers are supplied and guests take their time
pouring over the news that seems a world away as they sip
on fresh brewed coffee.
Shelves in the parlor and in most of the inn's rooms are
filled with Daisy MacCallum's old books, many dating
back to the beginning of the century. The library is filled
with real classics and the innkeepers encourage guests to
feel free to pick up and read the books.
During the evenings the parlor is transformed into a
gourmet dining room with some of the best food and ser
vice on the coast. Even if you're not staying at the inn, be
sure not to miss their restaurant. Dinner reservations are
essential on weekends.
Describing the rooms at MacCallum is a tough task, for
every room is individual and special. In the main house
the rooms look much like how the house's founder, Daisy
MacCallum, must have kept them in the late 1800s. These
are quaint bedrooms with overstuffed quilt comforters
and antique wood furniture. Above the main floor are
three wonderful attic rooms which go for $48.60 per night
(all room rates include tax and breakfast). The attic rooms
also share a common sitting area overlooking the sea.
We stayed in the barn, just a short stroll across the
beautiful garden. There are five rooms in the barn, rang
ing from simple small bedrooms to large suites complete
with kitchen, fireplace and sunken bathtub. The largest
suite is called the "barn apartment" and runs $124 per
night. If you travel with a few friends, the barn rooms
have the option of connecting.
Perhaps the most unique room is located on the second
floor of the old water tower. The room has private bath
and a view of the sea for $91. My favorite room was the
Gazebo Playhouse, a small cottage outside the main
house. It has a great view and private porch for sitting in
the Pacific sun enjoying the view. The Gazebo shares a
bath with its nearby neighbor the Redwood Cottage. Both
rooms run $56 per night. If you've always dreamed of
sleeping in a canopied bed, try the Carriage House Room
with private bath for $91.

Despite the fanciful rooms and unbeatable restaurant,
MacCallum's real charm is in its people. Somehow the at
mosphere is simply conducive to friendship. At the end of
a weekend most guests in the house are on a first name
basis.
MacCallum's manager, Patti Rainer, is an expert at
matching individuals to rooms. When guests call for
reservations, she patiently queries them about their tastes
and then suggests several available rooms. For reserva
tions or information call the house at 707-937-0289. The
inn offers substantial discounts from Sunday through
Thursday.

Located on two magnificent acres in the outskirts of
Mendocino, Joshua Grindle House is the oldest of Men
docino's many bed and breakfasts. Owners Bill and
Gwenn Jacobson invite all guests to "park and forget the
car" while relaxing and enjoying views of the village, bay
and ocean.
The inn has a colorful and rich history. Joshua Grindle
left his home in Maine in the 1860s to make his fortune in
California. Unlike many others working the mines or pan
ning for gold, Grindle devoted his energy to lumberjack
ing and timber production. He capitalized on Men
docino's central location in making the town a major cen
ter of the early California timber industry. His success in
business, combined with real estate interests in San Fran
cisco, made Grindle one of the wealthiest men in Men
docino.
Beyond his fondness for money and material, Grindle
reportedly had a healthy appetite for members of the op
posite sex. Although married most of his adult life,
Grindle kept busy chasing many of the town's young
lovelies. The present Joshua Grindle House Inn was built
for his second wife, Alice Hills Grindle. Some of the
town's older residents still recall Grindle with fondness as
an "impeccably dressed, dignified, lecherous old man."
The current inn reflects a combination of Grindle's per
sonality as well as the tastes of the current owners. The
nine guest rooms and two common areas are decorated
with early American antiques as well as a number of beau
tiful artworks from local craftspeople. The overall effect is
one of total relaxation and down-home hospitality.
Breakfast is a family affair. Guests sit across from one
another down a long table while Gwenn prepares a deli
cious breakfast.
The early American and New England country theme
and decor are carried throughout the inn. The five rooms
in the main house are replete with wooden poster beds,
duck decoys, antique farm tools, political memorabilia
and an assortment of interesting icons. Fresh flowers in
each of the rooms add a bit of color and fragrance to the
setting.
The library, an especially appealing room, features an
old fireplace bordered by antique ceramic tiles depicting
Aesop fables. Above the hearth is a painting of a fox from

one of the fables, created by a talented artist from the vil
lage. A wonderful assortment of classic books featuring
the best of Jack London, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan
Doyle, line the shelves.
For those wishing more privacy, look into the four
rooms outside the main house. These rooms are newer
and feature wood-burning stoves.
If you manage to drag yourself away from the charm of
the inn, Bill and Gwenn are able and willing to provide in
formation on a number of nearby activities. The pace up
here is slow; the most popular pastime is simply strolling
along the main street or out onto the headlands. Two
magnificent state parks, Russian Gulch (less than a mile

north of town) and Van Damme (4 miles south) offer iso
lated trails and beautiful scenery for walks and picnics.
For a fun evening out, try the Wellspring Restaurant at
905 Ukiah .Street. They have live classical music during
dinner hours and jazz in the late evenings. Reservations
may be made by calling 707-937-4567. The Wellspring is
attached to Casper Tubs, a hot tub and sauna rental spot
popular with locals and tourists alike.
1 he Joshua Grindle Inn will welcome you, pamper you,
feed you and generally make you forget about your
worries and concerns. After all, that's why the inn exists.
Room rates range from $62-$76 per night. For reserva
tions call the Jacobsons at 707-937-4143.
