### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE â€” Nine weeks ago, the
Washington State men's basketball
team traveled to Stanford to help the
Cardinal open the 1986 Pacific 10
Conference basketball season. To
morrow, the Cardinal will visit Pull
man to close the campaign against
that same Washington State team in a
5 p.m. contest.
Stanford has had its ups and downs
in the season in between, .going into
the finale with a record of 8-9 and 14-
15 overall.
Stanford will be looking to finish
with a .500 record in the conference
for the first time since 1973, when it
was 7-7.
Stanford Coach Tom Davis said he
didn't have a goal set for the Cardinal
at the beginning of the season. "I
don't like to do that. This year, if we
set a number, then lose Steve Brown
and Earl Koberlein, it could get
pretty discouraging. 1 feel good about
the progress of this team. I'd like to
see them finish with another fine
game."
The Cougars have had more downs
than ups this year. After last night's
81-78 overtime victory at home over
California, they are 7-10 in the con
ference, 14-16 overall and in eighth
place in the Pac 10.
The one bright spot for WSU
Coach Len Stevens' has been the play
of senior guard Keith Morrison. An
all-conference selection, Morrison
leads the Cougars with 14.3 points
and 4.3 assists per game. Center Otis
Jennings follows at 10.7 points per
game with forward Joe Wallace at
10.3.
The Cardinal won't look to do
much different tomorrow to stop the
Cougars. "I think it's more trying to
do our own thing," Davis said.
"The key is to run some offense. If
we come down and shoot in the open
court, we can't get the rebound. Our
guys are too slow, to be honest. If we
run our offense, we know when the
shot's going up, and we can get the

spring football workouts.
rebound and get some points."
Stanford won the initial meeting
84-67 to kick off the conference
season. Todd Lichti scored 17 points
to lead the Cardinal, while Novian
Whitsitt had 16 and Koberlein
had 15. Keith Ramee had his best
scoring night of the season with 14
points.
Stanford has had its problems at
Friel Court; the Cardinal hasn't won
in Pullman since 1975. Washington
State has won 18 of the last 21
meetings, and leads the series 42-31.
Tomorrow's game will be broad
cast on KCBS (740 AM). KZSU will
not carry the game.
