# Wright and Lichti not enough in loss
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE — It was a classic case
of adding injury to insult.
The Washington men's basketball
team got a career high 23 points from
guard Greg Hill to defeat Stanford
last night 96-87 in front of 6,725 at
Edmundson Pavilion.
But what really hurt the Cardinal
was the loss of junior guard John
Paye with a severely broken nose
midway through the second half. He
was defending Washington guard A 1
Moscatel, who caught him squarely
with an elbow.
On the previous Husky possession,
Stanford center Howard Wright had
grabbed the rebound. After he came
down with it, Moscatel tried to slap
the ball away, and Wright caught
Moscatel with an elbow as he
maneuvered to try and keep posses
sion.
The next time downcourt, Moscatel
turned straight into Paye, leading
with the elbow. No foul was called.
"1 was a little upset with that,"
Stanford Coach Tom Davis said,
"and so were the players. There's no
place in this game for that.
"It was one of those things where
he was trying to clear him out of the
way with an elbow. That's a technical
foul anyway, whether he gets him or
not. Three refs and no one saw it —
or at least no one called the foul."
Moscatel said, "In our offense, I
get the ball and swing around right
away. I just caught him hard. It was
toally unintentional. I felt pretty bad
about it."
Paye was taken to University
Hospital on the campus here, where
he was examined for about 90
minutes before being released. X
rays confirmed the fracture, but his
nose had swollen too much to allow
for surgery, according to Stanford
trainer Dake Walden.
"There's really no urgency," Wal
den said. "They probably won't be
able to operate until Sunday or Mon
day at the earliest, if he needs it."
Paye's parents were at the game
last night, and he spent the night at
the Westin Hotel here with them and
the team. He will miss tomorrow's

game at Washington State.
Asked about Paye's outlook for
spring football workouts which begin
April 6, Walden said, "I would say he
would probably be ready. The way
it's structured, he probably wouldn't
see any contact, so I don't see a prob
lem."
Paye's injury came at the 11:30
mark in the second half, just as the
Cardinal seemed about to overcome a
48-37 halftime deficit. Stanford had
just closed to 61-56 when it occurred.
Keith Ramee replaced Paye, and
he and Todd Lichti engaged in a jos
tling match with Moscatel until Davis
called a timeout.
The timeout didn't settle the Card
inal, which had already endured a fan
shoving center Eric Reveno after
Reveno dove out of bounds for a
loose ball. Stanford came apart faster
than a cheap paperback novel.
Washington outscored Stanford
17-6 over the next three-and-a-half
minutes — the frustration illustrated
best by a technical foul called on
Wright for hanging on the rim after a
missed slam dunk.
"We lost our composure on that
stretch," Davis said. "They played
well, but we stopped running our of
fense and didn't shut them down on
the other end. It (Paye's injury) was
pretty disruptive to us."
The Cardinal didn't die, though.
After the Huskies opened an 85-64
lead with 5:40 to go, Stanford ran off
a 16-4 spurt of its own to pull to 89-
80 with 1:20 left, but the Cardinal
could get no closer.
"We kept battling back," Davis
said. "They were still sweating with
two minutes to go. We didn't let them
run us out of here. At the beginning
of the year, we couldn't do that."
"I thought," Washington Coach
Andy Russo said, "we did a great job
in the second half turning the tempo
our way. The tempo was definitely in
their favor. They ran that thing up
and down the floor, moved the ball
around, and a lot of fouls resulted.
We played a zone to rest people in
the second half, which allowed them
to get closer. We moved to a man-to
man and did a great job getting back
under control."
The Cardinal — especially Wright
— held its own against the Husky
front line of Pacific 10 Conference
Player of the Year Chris Welp, All
Pac-10 forward Paul Fortier and for
ward Shag Williams. Stanford out
rebounded Washington 41-39.
Welp, a 7-foot senior, had 19
points and 14 rebounds, while
Wright, a 6-8 freshman, had 18
points and 10 rebounds.
Lichti led all scorers with 24 points,
including the usual several spectacu
lar moves over and around the Husky
defense. Lichti has now scored 499
points this year. Only nine Stanford
players have scored 500 points in a
season — none of them freshmen.
With the loss, Stanford falls to 8-9
in the Pac-10, 14-15 overall. Wash
ington clinched second place in the
Pac-10 and probably an NCAA
tournament bid while improving to
13-4 in the conference and 19-10
overall.
