# Critical Six-Pac weekend on tap for No. 7 batsmen
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Parity could very well get its play this weekend at
Sunken Diamond, where Stanford hosts UCLA in a
three-game weekend series that starts today at 2 p.m.
You see, the Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Divi
sions or more commonly the Six-Pac, is not what it used to
be. Gone are the days of runaway pennant races, of
dynasties forged in iron. At least so says Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess.
"There are four or five teams that have a legitimate
shot at winning it (the conference title)," Marquess said.
Even the Bruins, who last year finished way down there in
fifth in the Six-Pac with a league mark of 13-17? "There's

just no telling," Marquess said.
"I don't think we can win consistently if we continue
playing like we have been,"the Cardinal coach, now in his
1 Oth year, said.
"We've gotten good pitching, and we're playing better
defense, but we're not doing that well offensively,"
Marquess said.
All this means that Stanford, a team that has reigned
atop the Six-Pac for three years, isn't quite what it used to
be, right?
Well, it isn't that simple. The Cardinal, 2-1 in the Six-
Pac after taking two of three games from Arizona in Tuc-
son last weekend, is back where it's
most familiar, in first place. So what
are we to believe?
"We've played 21 games,"
Marquess said, "and there are two
ways to look at it: Either 'What you
see is what you get,' in which case it'll
be a real dogfight, or the offense will
come around and we'll be a much
better ballclub."
Presently, Stanford is 15-6 overall
and only two games back of the pace
set by last Cardinal squad, a team that
went to the College World Series.
The country's baseball coaches, in a
Baseball America poll released Mon
day, chose Stanford as the nation's
seventh best team — they've got to
know something. In any case, this
weekend should be telling.
Stanford will play host to a UCLA
team that Marquess calls "a lot like
us, with pretty good pitching and a
mixture of some young players with
some old." The Bruins, 1-2 in the

Six-Pac and losers of four straight,
start freshmen at shortstop and third
base.
"But they're different from us in an
important way," Marquess contin
ued. "They don't have a tremendous
amount of team speed, but they do hit
a lot of home runs." Going into the
weekend series, Stanford has hit only
12 longballs this year, while UCLA,
12-7 overall, has amassed 27.
"If we can keep them in the yard,
we'll be fine," Marquess said. His
pitching staff has surrendered 14
home runs.
All Six-Pac catcher Todd Zeile,
who is hitting .338, leads the Bruins
with five home runs. The designated
hitter, Steve Hisey, has driven in a
team-high 15 runs to go with his .346
batting average.
Today's pitching matchup features
Stanford's Jack McDowell, 5-1 with a
2.06 ERA, against Randy Hennis, 2-
2 with a 5.02 ERA. McDowell, a
right-hander picked as a preseason
All-America, won last Friday's game
in Tucson 6-4.
Steve Chitren, 2-1, will go for the

Cardinal tomorrow at 1 p.m. against
UCLA. The Bruins' starter for to
morrow's middle game has not been
announced.
On Sunday, Rob Wassenaar, 2-1,
will start for Stanford while Alex
Sanchez, who plays center field when
not on the mound, will go for UCLA.
Card notes
Last year, Stanford swept the
Bruins in Los Angeles and won two
of three here. Walt Harris hit one of
his two home runs on the year in the
bottom of the ninth with two outs in
Sunday's rubber game to lead the
Cardinal to a 9-8 victory.
Southpaw A 1 Osuna, solidly estab
lished in Stanford's starting rotation
until last weekend in Tucson, has lost
his spot, at least temporarily.
"Osuna's curveball has deserted
him," Marquess said, "and his slider
has flattened out. But we're sure he'll
be fine."
If any of this weekend's games are
rained out, the teams will make them
up when Stanford journeys to Los
Angeles in early April.

of three here. Walt Harris hit one of
his two home runs on the year in the
bottom of the ninth with two outs in
Sunday's rubber game to lead the
Cardinal to a 9-8 victory.
Southpaw A 1 Osuna, solidly estab
lished in Stanford's starting rotation
until last weekend in Tucson, has lost
his spot, at least temporarily.
"Osuna's curveball has deserted
him," Marquess said, "and his slider
has flattened out. But we're sure he'll
be fine."
If any of this weekend's games are
rained out, the teams will make them
up when Stanford journeys to Los
Angeles in early April.
Parity could very well get its play this weekend at
Sunken Diamond, where Stanford hosts UCLA in a
three-game weekend series that starts today at 2 p.m.
You see, the Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Divi
sions or more commonly the Six-Pac, is not what it used to
be. Gone are the days of runaway pennant races, of
dynasties forged in iron. At least so says Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess.
"There are four or five teams that have a legitimate
shot at winning it (the conference title)," Marquess said.
Even the Bruins, who last year finished way down there in
fifth in the Six-Pac with a league mark of 13-17? "There's

just no telling," Marquess said.
"I don't think we can win consistently if we continue
playing like we have been,"the Cardinal coach, now in his
1 Oth year, said.
"We've gotten good pitching, and we're playing better
defense, but we're not doing that well offensively,"
Marquess said.
All this means that Stanford, a team that has reigned
atop the Six-Pac for three years, isn't quite what it used to
be, right?
Well, it isn't that simple. The Cardinal, 2-1 in the Six-
Pac after taking two of three games from Arizona in Tuc-
son last weekend, is back where it's
most familiar, in first place. So what
are we to believe?
"We've played 21 games,"
Marquess said, "and there are two
ways to look at it: Either 'What you
see is what you get,' in which case it'll
be a real dogfight, or the offense will
come around and we'll be a much
better ballclub."
Presently, Stanford is 15-6 overall
and only two games back of the pace
set by last Cardinal squad, a team that
went to the College World Series.
The country's baseball coaches, in a
Baseball America poll released Mon
day, chose Stanford as the nation's
seventh best team — they've got to
know something. In any case, this
weekend should be telling.
Stanford will play host to a UCLA
team that Marquess calls "a lot like
us, with pretty good pitching and a
mixture of some young players with
some old." The Bruins, 1-2 in the

Six-Pac and losers of four straight,
start freshmen at shortstop and third
base.
"But they're different from us in an
important way," Marquess contin
ued. "They don't have a tremendous
amount of team speed, but they do hit
a lot of home runs." Going into the
weekend series, Stanford has hit only
12 longballs this year, while UCLA,
12-7 overall, has amassed 27.
"If we can keep them in the yard,
we'll be fine," Marquess said. His
pitching staff has surrendered 14
home runs.
All Six-Pac catcher Todd Zeile,
who is hitting .338, leads the Bruins
with five home runs. The designated
hitter, Steve Hisey, has driven in a
team-high 15 runs to go with his .346
batting average.
Today's pitching matchup features
Stanford's Jack McDowell, 5-1 with a
2.06 ERA, against Randy Hennis, 2-
2 with a 5.02 ERA. McDowell, a
right-hander picked as a preseason
All-America, won last Friday's game
in Tucson 6-4.
Steve Chitren, 2-1, will go for the

Cardinal tomorrow at 1 p.m. against
UCLA. The Bruins' starter for to
morrow's middle game has not been
announced.
On Sunday, Rob Wassenaar, 2-1,
will start for Stanford while Alex
Sanchez, who plays center field when
not on the mound, will go for UCLA.
Card notes
Last year, Stanford swept the
Bruins in Los Angeles and won two
of three here. Walt Harris hit one of
his two home runs on the year in the
bottom of the ninth with two outs in
Sunday's rubber game to lead the
Cardinal to a 9-8 victory.
Southpaw A 1 Osuna, solidly estab
lished in Stanford's starting rotation
until last weekend in Tucson, has lost
his spot, at least temporarily.
"Osuna's curveball has deserted
him," Marquess said, "and his slider
has flattened out. But we're sure he'll
