# HCC cannot interpret PCD, Kennedy says
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
has rejected a proposal to grant the Honor
Code Commission (J ICC) interpretaUonal
powers concerning the Policy on Campus
Disruption (PCD).
In a letter to ASSIJ Council of Presi
dents (COP) member Mike Collins dated
Wednesday, Kennedy said the PCD has
a history laden with "constitutional
legitimacy," adding that the policy was
"ratified and adopted by the student body,
the Faculty Senate and the administration
in 1968-69."

The letter was a response to a Feb. 4 let
ter from Collins urging Kennedy to charge
the HCC with "considering problems and
raising awareness about student gover
nance policy through a joint student
faculty-administrative effort."
The COP letter said, "Serious questions
were raised . . . both on the merits of the
policy itself and on the procedures and
conditions governing its application," and
assessed the relationship of the PCD to the
Honor Code and the Fundamental Stan
dard by saying, "The PCD is a separate,
distinct policy which explicitly outlaws cer
tain behavior."
In his letter, Kennedy -agreed that

"students should inform themselves about
all three rules affecting their on-campus
behavior." He said this goal is encouraged
by the Office of the President, which dis
tributes the booklet" Regulations.Â£k>vern
ing Student Conduct and the Procedures
for Their Enforcement" and encourages
residence-based discussions concerning
student behavior. He also noted that the
Judicial Affairs Office regularly publishes
summaries of disciplinary cases.
Saying the HCC was chartered "to edu
cate this community about the Honor
Code," Kennedy said he is "not inclined to
expand its mission to take on tasks not di
rectly related to its charge," especially that

of interpreting any of the rules governing
student conduct.
"The SCLC (Student Conduct
Legislative Council) is the only body em
powered to change or issue interpretations
of Stanford's disciplinary rules," Kennedy
said
In an interview last night, Collins said,
"The idea that the HCC is only responsible
for a small slice of responsibility ... is cer
tainly his (Kennedy's) prerogative, but it's
certainly not written in clay tablets. If he
was in a mind to expand the HCC, it could
be done.
