# Gymnasts battle Arizona for nation's top ranking
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Last time the top two teams in col
legiate men's gymnastics clashed in
Maples Pavilion, Stanford was No. 1
and UCLA was No. 2. UCLA won
the meet and took over the top spot
in the nation.
Since that meet, three weeks ago,
the Bruins have dropped down in the
rankings and Arizona State has
stepped onto the throne. Tonight, the
Wildcats come into Maples at 7:30 to
face the No. 2 Cardinal, which hopes
that history will repeat itself and that
it will return to the top spot.
Stanford boasts the best score in
the nation thus far this season with
the 281.5 it hit two weeks ago.
Arizona State, however, has the high
est five-meet average in the country,
and, therefore, is ranked first.
Besides boasting the top score, the
Cardinal also boasts the top single
gymnast in the country, Randy Be
sosa. According to Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada, the average of Be
sosa's single event personal bests is
the highest in college gymnastics at
this moment.

The Sun Devils, meanwhile, can
brag about their duo of Haydens,
twins Dan and Dennis. Dan
finished second in the all-around
competition at last year's NCAA
Championships. He won the high bar,
tied for first on the parallel bars, and
earned second place on the floor.
That's not all. Dan was last winter's
Pacific 10 Gymnast of the Year and
was the only collegian to compete in
the 1985 World Championships for
the United States.
The Haydens, though, have a
weakness. "The thing about them is
that they are often injured," Cardinal
sophomore Chuck Gerardo said.
According to Hamada. Dennis will
be going in the all-around tonight,
but his twin is a question mark, not
having competed in all six events yet
this season.
The Haydens are two of the many
returning Sun Devils on a squad that
finished fourth in the 1985 NCAAs.
However, despite their obviously
tough competition, the Cardinal is
not looking to give its best possible
performance at this evening's contest.
"I just want to make sure that we
take the right track to the NCAAs. In
the process, I hope we can beat

ASU," Hamada said. "If we beat
them, that's great, hut it is only one
dual meet. I'm totally foeusing on the
NCAAs."
Gerardo does not really consider
this meet as big as a couple earlier in
the season. "I'd say it's not quite as
important as when we went down to
UCLA or even as when UCLA was
here," he said.
Still, though, the meet should be an
incredible showcase of the best gym
nastics outside of Olympic competi
tion, and, most importantly for the
Cardinal, it is the curtain call for
Stanford seniors Jon Louis and Gary
Smith. An added attraction is the fact
that this meet will actually be a
double dual meet, with the women's
gymnastics team competing simulta
neously against New Mexico.
"It's our first dual meet with the
girls, and it's our last home meet of
the season, and it's the last home
meet for our two seniors . . . that's
enough drive to go out big," Besosa
said.
"1 hope that it will be a good com
petition so that they (Louis and
Smith) can remember this meet for a
long time." Hamada said.
