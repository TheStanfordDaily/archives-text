# Netters risk perfect record
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Nineteen eighty-two and 1984
will be remembered as two of the
greatest seasons in Stanford
women's tennis history. On both
occasions, undefeated seasons were
followed up by NCAA champion
ships.
After losing early in the nationals
last year, the Cardinal figures to
romp in 1986. That's the logical
line of thinking that seems, at least,
to follow the historical pattern of
the past few seasons, in which even
numbered years have treated the
Cardinal rather kindly.

As Stanford hosts weekend
matches today at 1:30 p.m. with
UC-Santa Barbara and tomorrow
at noon against Arizona State,
hopes of a perfect season are still
alive. One month into the season,
the Cardinal is 7-0 and ranked No.
2 in the nation.
Some people close to the team
prefer to downplay the significance
of going undefeated, however.
"Frank (Brennan, Stanford's
coach) always tells us that with our
schedule we could lose," junior
Stephanie Savides said.
But Savides and others maintain
hopes of compiling an unblemished
record. "Definitely we could lose,"

she said. "But I don't know. We
have enough fighters. We seem to
pull out matches."
If nothing else, a victory over
visiting UCSB today is very
probable. In fact, Brennan will rest
half of his singles players, though
he will use each of his top three
doubles teams.
Junior Patty Fendick, 4-2 in
singles play following an 0-2 start in
Arizona, will play at her usual No.
1 position. Junior Leigh Anne
Eldredge and freshman Marianne
Werdel will be the only other regu
lar singles players taking to the
court.
Eldredge had her winning streak
snapped at four matches Wednesday
by California's freshman Alissa
Finerman. Werdel, on the other
hand, probably wishes that she had a
winning streak to be broken. The
highly-touted Bakersfield native fell
to 1-4, following a frustrating three
set loss to Cal's Jennifer Prah.
Brennan will be using the full
lineup tomorrow as the Cardinal at
tempts to extend its Pac-West record
to 4-0 against ASU. On Feb. 21, the
Cardinal knocked off the Sun Devils

6-3 in Tempe. The match was closer
than the score indicated, however.
After the singles action, the teams
were tied at 3-3. The Cardinal
doubles teams then proceeded to
sweep the Sun Devils to clinch the
match.
Savides indicated that the Cardinal
will be aided by the same home-court
advantage that helped the Sun Devils
keep the last match close. "They're
tough, but we shouldn't lose too
many matches," she said.
The Cardinal doubles teams have
been near-perfect this season, provid
ing the difference in the few close
matches that the team has been in
volved in.
