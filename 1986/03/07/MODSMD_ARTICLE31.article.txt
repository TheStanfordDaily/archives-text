Nineteen eighty-two and 1984
will be remembered as two of the
greatest seasons in Stanford
women's tennis history. On both
occasions, undefeated seasons were
followed up by NCAA champion

the past few seasons, in which even
numbered years have treated the
Cardinal rather kindly.

As Stanford hosts weekend
matches today at 1:30 p.m. with
UC-Santa Barbara and tomorrow
at noon against Arizona State,
hopes of a perfect season are still
alive. One month into the season,
the Cardinal is 7-0 and ranked No.

Stephanie Savides said.
But Savides and others maintain
hopes of compiling an unblemished

visiting UCSB today is very

doubles teams.
Junior Patty Fendick, 4-2 in
singles play following an 0-2 start in
Arizona, will play at her usual No.
1 position. Junior Leigh Anne
Eldredge and freshman Marianne
Werdel will be the only other regu
