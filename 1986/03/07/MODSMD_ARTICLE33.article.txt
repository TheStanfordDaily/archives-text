# Spikers aiming for sweep
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
They've reached the beach in
Hawaii, and now the Stanford volley
ball players will attempt to put the fix
on the Rainbows tonight by polishing
off a two-game sweep.
Stanford knocked off eighth
ranked Hawaii Wednesday night in
five games, 15-11, 10-15, 3-15, 15-9,
15-13. The Rainbows, however, were
fighting a case of the flu that the
entire team apparently contracted
while on a recent roadtrip to Califor
nia.
"Most of my team has the flu right
now," Hawaii Coach Alan Rosehill
said. "We couldn't practice Monday.
We tried to go (work out) Tuesday,
and it wasn't a very effective one.
We're just not 100 percent. We don't
hive the stamina right now. It just

means I've got to play everybody."
A bigger problem for Rosehill's
team may be the play of Stanford All-
American outside hitter Jon Root,
who is starting to bounce back into
form after missing time due to a mid
season ankle injury.
"We were aware of Chris Braun
and Scott Fortune, but they didn't
hurt us as much as Root," Rosehill
said. "Having him in the lineup is a
bonus for them. He had 20 kills and
hit a team high of .412. In the clutch,
he pulled through with some real key
swings in the fifth game."
"He's our man that we go to in the
clutch," Root's teammate and outside
hitter John McDermott said.
Despite the fact that the No. 4
Cardinal was able to pull out a close
win in front of a large pro-Rainbow
crowd of nearly 1,000 fans, the
players are looking for a better per

formance tonight. Â»
"It will probably be close again,
McDermott, a native of Hawaii, said.
"Both the teams will probably piay a
lot better."
"Hopefully we can go out and play
a lot better," sophomore middle
blocker Fortune said. "We're the bet
ter team."
Tonight's matchup carries particu
lar importance for Hawaii.
"Stanford and us are battling for a
spot in the (NCAA) regionals,"
Rosehill said. "You've got to win at
home in this league."
In addition to their fan support, the
Rainbows have another unique ad
vantage while playing at home.
"It's kind of hard," McDermott
said of the Hawaiian roadtrip,
"because everyone lays out in the
sun, and it drains you."

Doug "Hoss" Robbins leads the Cardinal in RBIs and will be counted on to provide some offensive punch
against a potent UCLA team in a three-game weekend set at Sunken Diamond.
