# Women look to rebound

Hoping to improve on their disappointing score from
last weekend's H'obee's Invitational, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team enters tonight's competition
against New Mexico with a sense of optimism and enthusi
asm.
The meet, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavillion,
will also feature the Cardinal men challenging top ranked
Arizona State.
"It should be a good meet," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina said. "Competing with the guys should add an
other level of intensity and energy.
"Both visiting teams are exciting." he added. "It will be
No. 1 versus No. 2 for the men, and two evenly matched
teams that are potentially national qualifiers for the
women."
New Mexico beat the Cardinal two weeks ago in Albu
querque, but only by one point. "These are two very close
teams, and were very close last year," Sardina said. "They
were ranked with us in the top 15 in pre-season, and both
teams have been struggling.
"This weekend, we would like to get back on a winning
way, on a roll again," Sardina said. "I once again think we
can go 183. but with the officials, I don't know. If we go

183, that will put our average in the 180 range and move
us from 19 to 14 in the rankings.
"They beat us at New Mexico," he added, "but if the
judging is like last week, they will be shell-shocked."
At last Friday's Hobee's Invitational, each team scored
about four points below its average score. In fact, Stan
ford's high score at home, 178.70, is far below its onfthe
road average of 181.
Despite the concern over low scores, the Cardinal gym
nasts are making exciting and bold changes in some of
their routines. "Sherri Evenson may do a double back on
the floor," Sardina said, "and Pam Blom might use a new
vault and a new dismount on uneven bars."
Sardina again anticipates a great performance from
freshman Jinny Rhee. "If she's feeling no ill effects from
Friday's meet, she might yet break the school all-around
record." The current high score, garnered by Merilyn
Chapman in 1982, is 37.55.
"Look for Jinny, Laurence George again on beam,
Sherri on floor exercise, and Cheryl Doo in all-around,"
Sardina commented.
Evenson shared Sardina's confidence in the team.
"Hopefully, we will do pretty well," she said. "We have
the ability; we just need to hit our routines. We're
psyched to have a good meet."
