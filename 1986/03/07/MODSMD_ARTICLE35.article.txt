# Swimmers attempt to meet standards

### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
For most Stanford women's
swimmers, only the NCAAs from
March 20-22 remain.
However, for those who have
not yet qualified in their specific
events, today's Golden Bear Invi
tational at Berkeley and tomor
row's Cardinal Invitational at
DeGuerre Pool represent one last
hope of making the NCAA
cutoffs.
Stanford swimmers Aimee Ber
zins (50-yard freestyle), Monica
Nielebeck (200 individual med
ley), Michelle Chapman (200
freestyle) and Stephanie Norton
(200 butterfly) will join California
swimmers today at 2 p.m. in an at
tempt to qualify in their individual
events.
"We have a chance," Stanford
Coach George Haines said. "They
have all done the times before, it is
just a matter of getting it done."
Tomorrow at 10:30 a.m., Card
inal swimmers Susan Lenth (200

breaststroke) and senior co
captain Diana Zock (50 and 100
freestyle) will compete with those
Stanford and California swimmers
who did not qualify at Berkeley
with a swimmer from San Jose
State in the Cardinal Invite.
"Susan Lenth should do it
(qualify)," Haines said. "Monica
Nielebeck should do it easily, and
Michelle Chapman has a real good
chance."
Diana Zock, after qualifying in
the 50 and 100 freestyle for the
past three years, is still trying to
make the cutoff this year. She is
two-hundredths of a second off in
the 50 and six-hundredths of a
second off the cutoff in the 100
free.
"I can't get any closer without
qualifying," Zock said. "I am
pretty confident that I am going to
qualify."
Saturday's meet is the last
chance to see the Cardinal swim
mers in action. They enter the
NCAA Championships as the No.
3-ranked team in the nation.
