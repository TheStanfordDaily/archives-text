# Both men and women have high hopes for upcoming regattas
## Crew looks strong for 1986 season 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
It is time to see if the many months
of rigorous training are finally going
to pay off, and according to all con
cerned, it's about time.
The Stanford men's and women's
crew teams will open their long
awaited seasons this weekend, com
peting in separate regattas. The men
host San Diego State at home on Sun
day while the women travel to
Sacramento to compete in the River
City Regatta.
Both teams are untested but have
high hopes for the season. "We're
really excited about the opportunity
to test ourselves," Stanford men's
Coach Ken Dreyfuss said. "I want to
find out how we react under pres
sured and uncertain conditions.
We're anxious to be in a racing situa
tion."
The many hours of training
through the fall and winter have
weeded out the uncommitted rowers
and left the rest a well-seasoned
group ready to compete.
"There is lots of long hard work

behind us, a lot of miles under the
boat and on the water. We've
developed a strong work ethic." Stan
ford women's Coach John Davis
said. "This is a good chance to shar
pen our skills before the season. We
may have to sharpen real hard, with a
file, not a whetstone. We're not quite
ready, but I think we'll be ready."
Regulation 2,000-meter regattas,
the major part of the crew season, are
set to begin March 29, but this
weekend will provide a beneficial
tune-up. "We want to go through all
of the details and preparation that
would go into a normal race, but well
enough in advance that we have time
to experiment and learn," Dreyfuss
said.
Though it is important for experi
ence's sake, this weekend isn't being
taken too seriously. "Both schools
realize the importance of early season
tune-ups," Dreyfuss said. "But
practice will be the same Monday
whether we win or lose."
"It is an opportunity to get feed
back from the rowers," men's varsity
coxswain Jerry Montgomery said.
Both teams feel they are in a better

position than last year going into this
weekend and anticipate competitive
seasons in the future. "This is the
toughest season we've ever planned
for," Davis said. "The selection
process for boats was much tougher
than I anticipated. This team pro
vided some real nice surprises. It is
going to be a good crew; how good is
up to the rowers."
"We feel that we are mentally and
physically significantly ahead of last
year at this time," Dreyfuss said.
The rowers too are optimistic
about the season and this weekend.
"We are a lot stronger than last
year," men's varsity rower R.J.
Schembs said. "I personally feel
much more confident about racing.
This weekend we have a lot of things
in our favor. We know the course and
we're used to rowing in less than ideal
conditions. It's not really important,
but it would be nice to win."
Both the men's and women's teams
finished third overall on the West
Coast last year, but this year they're
shooting for the top. "Our team, es
pecially the older ones, have a set to
their teeth, a chip on their shoulder,"

Davis said. "This is the year to push
ourselves back on top."
The women's team will race two
frosh eights and three open eights in a
field which includes Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo, UC-Davis, Sacramento
State, Humboldt State and St.
Mary's. In the varsity boat will be
Emily Ellison, Mary Lynn Wrye,
Kerri Clark, Felicia Keesing, Hilde
Emslander, Kristin Dahl, Anne
Farnham, stroke Lynn Gothrop and
coxswain Mary Courtney.
The men will race a varsity, junior
varsity and freshmen boat against San
Diego State. The varsity boat will,
most likely, be manned by Karl Ol
son, Duncan Ross, Ed Roeder, R.J.
Schembs, Andy Hargadon, John Lat
ting, Jay Finney, stroke Craig Bouck
and coxswain Jerry Montgomery.
Crew only recently became a var
sity sport on the Farm after years as a
club sport, and is now able to com
pete with traditional West Coast
powers Washington and California on
a more equal footing.
