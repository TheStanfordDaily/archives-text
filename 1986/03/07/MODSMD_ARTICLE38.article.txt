# Cardinal favorite for regional title
## 
### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
Southern California is definitely the place to be
this weekend. Why? Fun, sun and the Stanford
women's fencing teams â€” of course!
Today and tomorrow in Fullerton, the Cardinal
women will shoot for No. 1 as they face Air Force,
the University of San Diego, Texas/San Antonio,
Long Beach State, UC-Santa Cruz and Fullerton
State in the Women's Western Regional Cham
pionships.
The Stanford women, ranked No. 7 in the nation,
head into this tournament with a 14-0 season
record. "We're the two-time defending regional
champions," Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst said.

"We're going into these regionals with a decidedly
stronger team than the one that won it last year."
Hurst has no doubts about his team's chances for
success: "I just can't see who can give us trouble
given the strength of our team this year," he said.
According to Hurst, "Fullerton should be our
strongest competition. They won their Southern
California Conference this year and their only
defeat this season was to us.
"I would expect Stanford and Fullerton to be the
two teams representing the West Coast in the
NCAA Nationals this year," he added.
Ail-American Jennifer Yu leads the women into
the tournament as the two-time defending individ
ual champion. With a season record of 49-0,
"Jennifer is head and shoulders above any other

woman in the region," Hurst said.
"Holly Taylor and Alison Reid come in right be
hind Jennifer as the second and third strongest in
the region while Alyson Yarus is definitely in the
top 10 or better," Hurst said of his other fencers.
Should the Cardinal women qualify for the
NCAA Nationals at Princeton University later this
month, they will join Stanford's top five men, El
liott Cheu, Andy Goorno, Steve Levitan, Larry
Murk and Dave Finkelstein in head-to-head battles
against some formidable East Coast competition.
The Stanford men are also ranked among the na
tion's top 10 and turned in a strong performance at
their regionals last weekend in San Francisco.
