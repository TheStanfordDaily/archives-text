# Women shoot for .500 in season finale
## Sourlis satisfied with Farm years 
### DONNA CLARKE 
As the women's basketball season ends with tomorrow
night's game against Arizona, so ends also the prodigious
basketball career of Stanford guard Virginia Sourlis.
Sourlis, one of the two graduating seniors on the team,
has scored 327 points this season and moved up to second
on the list of career-leading scorers in Stanford women's
basketball history. She is also the leader in career assists
with 481, surpassing Debbi Gore's record of 395.
"This year has been the best year," Sourlis said com
menting on the change of coaching personnel, "She (new
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerVeer) doesn't have reins on
me."
VanDerveer joined the Stanford coaching staff this
year, taking over from Dottie McCrea, who guided the
team for nine seasons.
"It is a tough adjustment for a senior to make, having a
new coach and a new system," VanDerveer said.
Sourlis has been able provide stability at point guard by
avoiding the injury jinx that has struck the Cardinal. "The
position of point guard is critical to our success," VanDer
veer said. "When she has had outstanding games our team
does well."
VanDerveer added that Sourlis shoulders a lot of re
sponsibility between being the captain and leading the
team on the floor and that it is frustrating to be sur
rounded by injuries and inexperience.
Nevertheless, VanDerveer said Sourlis' major contribu
tions to the team are her enthusiasm for playing and her
thinking on the court. As she has been for the last three
years, even at 5-foot-3, Sourlis is a focal point for the
team.

Virginia Sourlis will wrap up her Stanford career tomorrow night against Arizona. The diminutive 5-foot-3
guard is averaging 12.1 points per game with a high of 25 versus Arizona State. She has started all 27 Stan
ford games this year and 113 out of 116 in her career. She will also retire as the Cardinal's all-time assist
leader.
"I had to work that much harder
because I am short," Sourlis said.
"Quickness was key and I had to be a
smarter player. I had to shoot
quicker, have a quicker release and
handle the ball better than other
guards."
Having one game left in her playing
career is a little disturbing for Sourlis,
a senior majoring in communications.
"It's going to be hard," she said. "I
know I will always be playing, but
now more just to have fun."
VanDerveer predicted that Sourlis
will eventually become a coach. "She
works real well and understands real
well, esperiallv vnnno kids." Van-

Derveer said.
Reflecting upon her four years on
the Farm, Sourlis said the best thing
about her experiences here was
choosing to attend Stanford in the
first place.
"You can't beat getting a free edu
cation and playing in one of the best
collegiate leagues," she said. "The
worst thing is having to leave, to go
back home after having only played
one year under Tara. She turned my
attitude around toward playing. Once
again I've played with aggression and
with the attitude of having fun."
"We're sorry she's a senior," Van-
Derveer said. "She really cares about
the University and what happens to
us. She even helps write recruiting
letters. She has given a lot to the team
that can't be measured in stats."
