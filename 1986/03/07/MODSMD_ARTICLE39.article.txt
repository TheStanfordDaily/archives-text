# Women shoot for .500 in season finale
## Sourlis satisfied with Farm years 
### DONNA CLARKE 
As the women's basketball season ends with tomorrow
night's game against Arizona, so ends also the prodigious
basketball career of Stanford guard Virginia Sourlis.
Sourlis, one of the two graduating seniors on the team,
has scored 327 points this season and moved up to second
on the list of career-leading scorers in Stanford women's
basketball history. She is also the leader in career assists
with 481, surpassing Debbi Gore's record of 395.
"This year has been the best year," Sourlis said com
menting on the change of coaching personnel, "She (new
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerVeer) doesn't have reins on
me."
VanDerveer joined the Stanford coaching staff this
year, taking over from Dottie McCrea, who guided the
team for nine seasons.
"It is a tough adjustment for a senior to make, having a
new coach and a new system," VanDerveer said.
Sourlis has been able provide stability at point guard by
avoiding the injury jinx that has struck the Cardinal. "The
position of point guard is critical to our success," VanDer
veer said. "When she has had outstanding games our team
does well."
VanDerveer added that Sourlis shoulders a lot of re
sponsibility between being the captain and leading the
team on the floor and that it is frustrating to be sur
rounded by injuries and inexperience.
Nevertheless, VanDerveer said Sourlis' major contribu
tions to the team are her enthusiasm for playing and her
thinking on the court. As she has been for the last three
years, even at 5-foot-3, Sourlis is a focal point for the
team.
