# GSB names new dean of Admissions
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Stanford's Graduate School of Business
has chosen a new director of admissions
for its MB.A. program, GSB News Direc
tor Rich Kurovsky announced yesterday.
R. Bruce Paton, the new director, will
take the position this summer after he
completes his second year as a student at
the business school. He will succeed
Wayne Forester, one-year acting director
of admissions.
Paton, 32, a self-proclaimed feminist,
said yesterday that he plans to emphasize

recruitment of women and minorities.
"More energy, imagination and commit
ment is needed to build the applicant
pool," he said.
"For some reason, talented women and
minority students choose not to apply in
large enough numbers. ... I think of me as
a talent scout, very strongly committed to
finding that talent out there. It's a difficult
job."
Paton said he hopes business school ap
plicants will espouse public service, "along
(University President) Don Kennedy's
lines." He noted that his own definition of
public service includes work in both the

public and private sectors, profit and non
profit, but always aimed at "improving the
world."
"It's not enough to want to make
money," he said.
Paton cited leadership potential, intel
lectual curiosity, creativity and people
skills as qualities he hopes applicants will
possess. He also emphasized the advan
tages of admitting a diverse class of stu
dents.
"People who have been out of school for
a few years may be good to get," he said,
adding that business school students com
ing right out of college might not get as

much out of the classes.
"Some faculty members want a more
academically oriented group," he said. "I
think that's better served by students with
work experience."
Paton entered Stanford's business
school with eight years of work experience.
After graduating from Wesleyan Univer
sity in 1976 with a bachelor's degree in en
vironmental science, he conducted
oceanography research for a year, did a
three-year stint in Washington, D.C.,
working in a local government water
quality program, and then spent four
years working for a small environ
mental engineering firm in Minne
sota.
At Stanford, Paton has focused his
graduate studies on organizational
behavior and management, and has
been active in the Public Manage
ment Program, the Manufacturing
Club, the Center for Entrepreneur
ship and the Women-in-Management
Steering Committee.
The admissions position — a four
year appointment — will offer good
general management experience,
Paton said, noting also that he hopes
to learn valuable skills in recognizing
and evaluating talent. Paton said he is
not sure of his long-term career goals.
