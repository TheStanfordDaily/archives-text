# Key for Cardinal stopping Acosta
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff writer 
When Tara VanDerveer reflects upon her first season
as coach of the Stanford women s basketball team, she
doesn't exactly know what to think.
"I look back and 1 sometimes wonder how we could
have lost so many games in a row," she said. 1 hen again,
sometimes I wonder how we won all those other games.
It's been that kind of season.
Should the Cardinal defeat the Arizona Wildcats in to
morrow night's season finale, it would finish with a 14-14
record, an appropriate mark for a team that has experi
enced its share of both high and low streaks this year.
A blend of fine talent and inexperienced players pro
vided an unstable mixture that accounted for Stanford s
roller-coaster performance this season. Most of the inex
perience, as well as a good deal of talent, stems from a
starting lineup that features two freshmen, Jill Yanke and
Evon Asforis.
"In my entire coaching career, I've never had to count
on freshmen as much as I had to this year," VanDerveer
said after Stanford's last game against Arizona. "But Jill
and Evon are ahead of any freshmen that I have ever
coached."
Unfortunately, Asforis' season ended prematurely
when she sprained a knee two weeks ago, and Yanke may
have to miss tomorrow night's game due to a bruised back
that has kept her out of action for two games.
However, the two injuries haven't prevented the Card
inal from winning lately. Stanford beat Arizona State last
Saturday and upset the U.S. International University
Gulls two days later with Yanke and Asforis, the Card-
inal's leading scorer and rebounder,
respectively, on the bench.
Stanford has fallen twice to the
Wildcats this year, mostly due to the
performances of 5-foot-7 junior Lava
Acosta, who has scored 46 points
against the Cardinal this year.

"Stopping Arizona means stopping
Acosta," Stanford Asst. Coach Julie
Plank said. "She drives and shoots
very well. In each of the two games,
she hurt us badly."
VanDerveer believes the Cardinal
will have some extra incentive to beat
Arizona.
"I think our players are mad that
that they have lost two games to these
guys. I think they'll be ready to play."
