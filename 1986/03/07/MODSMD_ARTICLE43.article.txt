Aquino case inquiry desired
MANILA — Pressure is building to reopen the investigation into the
1983 death of Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino as a senior
prosecutor in the case charged yesterday that deposed president Fer
dinand Marcos rigged the acquittal of 25 military men and one civilian
charged in the murder. -
Aquino was the husband of the country's new president, Corazon
Aquino, who came to power last week with the help of a military revolt
that forced Marcos to flee to the United States.
Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, co-leader of the military revolt,
called yesterday for a reopening of the case, saying it had "greatly
defamed the Philippines military."
Aquino's murder in August 1983 was the starting point of the wave of
organizing and protests that eventually put his wife in the president's of
fice. The new president has said she will seek the full truth about the
murder, but since assuming office has not treated it as a pressing issue.
No decision on a retrial has been announced.
Manuel Herrera, head of a panel of prosecutors in last year's trial, said
in a statement yesterday that it was a "failure of justice" and suggested
that a retrial would not constitute double jeopardy because the first one
was not valid.
He said prosecutors and one of the three justices who tried the case at
a special anticorruption court had attended a two-hour meeting at
Marcos' Malacanang presidential palace, where "the outlining of the
hows and whens of the trial" took place. Herrera compared the trial
proceedings to a movie where he "already knew the ending."
Craft visits Halley's Comet
MOSCOW — Halley's Comet, the legendary celestial object circling
past the Earth since the origin of the solar system, flashed into close-up
view yesterday for the first time.
Photographs from the Soviet Vega 1 spacecraft, orbiting within 5,400
miles of the comet's head, appeared on television screens at a Soviet
space center yesterday morning before a cheering crowd of scientists
from numerous nations. Photometric patterns shifted on the screen as a
bright yellow core came into focus, the first close look at the great
glowing ice ball that scientists had deduced was there.
"The size looks about three to four kilometers," about two miles,
droned the commentator. "Evidently, it is the nucleus."
For the scientists here, that initial confirmation was one of the morn
ing's most important events, to be followed by more tantalizing clues
about the size and density of dust particles being blown off from the icy
nucleus and frequency of waves of highly charged atomic particles.
Although the dust particles closer to the comet were finer and less
dense than expected, the spacecraft ran into a heavy jet of dust gushing
from the comet 25 minutes after it swung in for its closeup.
Brazil, Saudis agree to deal
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — In an arms-for-oil deal, Brazil and
Saudi Arabia have agreed to a $3 billion arms package that includes a
technological cooperation agreement, Brazilian sources said yesterday.
The agreement provides for the purchase by Saudi Arabia of 1,000
Osorio medium tanks, multiple rocket launchers and the Tucano T-27
airforce trainer, which Brazil already sold to Egypt and the British air
force, the sources said.
In addition to the sales, which are covered by a contract signed in
December, a Saudi military mission that visited Brazil's arms industries
this week laid the basis for a technology cooperation agreement.
The sources said this would include financial support for development
of advanced weapons, such as solid-fuel rockets and maintainance in
Saudi Arabia for the Brazilian weapons systems, including a tank spare
part plant to be built in Saudi Arabia.
Brazil's arms industries, based on the development of modern steel,
automotive, electronic and aeronautical industries, are the largest in the
developing countries. Teams from the Pentagon have been visiting the
factories for possible procurement of tanks and aircraft, which are low in
cost by U.S. defense industry standards.
ANC seeks S. African alliance
LUSAKA, Zambia — Exiled leaders of the main underground move
ment fighting white-minority rule in South Africa have indicated that
while the group is maintaining its hard-line public stance against
negotiating with the government, behind the scenes it is trying to form a
broad-based alliance that can pressure Pretoria into negotiating with
blacks about a new constitutional future. ,
Thabo Mbeki, publicity director of the African National Congress
(ANC), disclosed in an interview here that the organization was making
contact inside South Africa with a wide range of groups, ranging from
worried businessmen and white Afrikaner intellectuals to disillusioned
blacks holding office in the tribal "homelands" under the apartheid sys
tem of segregation.
"We are reaching out, exploring all these forces, trying to mobilize the
political weight of all of them to the point where Botha finds that he
can't go on confronting them in their totality and he says, okay, let's
talk," Mkeki said, referring to South African President Pieter Botha.
"At that point the ANC would be prepared to negotiate," added
Mbeki, one of the rising younger generation within the congress who is
widely regarded as a candidate for top leadership ranks.
Chad's insurgents repelled
N'DJAMENA, Chad — Hundreds of Libyan-backed rebels were
killed in a government counter-offensive in northeastern Chad, Western ,
diplomats said yesterday.
Officials of the Western-backed government of President Hissene
Habre said the region around the settlements of Oum-Chalouba and
Kalait, 450 miles northeast of N'Djamena, was calm after Wednesday's
heavy fighting.
The government Wednesday announced its forces had repelled the in
surgents after launching a two-pronged offensive against rebel stron
gholds at Fada to the northeast and Faya-Largeau to the northwest.
Officials gave only sketchy accounts of casualties, saying they inflicted
"heavy human and material losses" on the rebels of the Transitional
Government of National Union (GUNT).
Western diplomats here, however, said several hundred rebels were
killed or wounded in the clashes, which broke a lull of nearly three
weeks since the last outbreak of hositilites around at least four settle
ments in the area.
Iraq slowly losing in Gulf war
BAGHDAD, Iraq — After five and one-half brutal years of war with
Iran, the Iraqi army is faltering because of the lackluster performance of
its troops and political constraints placed on commanders by the govern
ment of President Saddam Hussein, according to Western military
analysts and diplomats here.
Despite overwhelming superiority in sophisticated armaments and
firepower and near total command of the skies over the battlefields, the
assessment of military experts here is that Iraq is slowly but inexorably
losing the war. Iraq's nearly 1 million men under arms, the military
analysts say. are simply not up to the task of resisting a fanatical Iranian
army that keeps coming at them, no matter how badly it is punished.
"It is all very sad. but Iraq proclaims victory after victory but is still
losing territory," said one Western military expert here. "They have air
superiority; they have the best and the most weapons; they talk a good
game of defending their homeland and issue a stream of optimistic state
ments. Yet, the fact is that since 1982, they have been steadily losing
ground, meter by meter maybe, but still losing."

talk," Mkeki said, referring to South African President Pieter Botha.
"At that point the ANC would be prepared to negotiate," added
Mbeki, one of the rising younger generation within the congress who is
widely regarded as a candidate for top leadership ranks.
Chad's insurgents repelled
N'DJAMENA, Chad — Hundreds of Libyan-backed rebels were
killed in a government counter-offensive in northeastern Chad, Western ,
diplomats said yesterday.
Officials of the Western-backed government of President Hissene
Habre said the region around the settlements of Oum-Chalouba and
Kalait, 450 miles northeast of N'Djamena, was calm after Wednesday's
heavy fighting.
The government Wednesday announced its forces had repelled the in
surgents after launching a two-pronged offensive against rebel stron
gholds at Fada to the northeast and Faya-Largeau to the northwest.
Officials gave only sketchy accounts of casualties, saying they inflicted
"heavy human and material losses" on the rebels of the Transitional
Government of National Union (GUNT).
Western diplomats here, however, said several hundred rebels were
killed or wounded in the clashes, which broke a lull of nearly three
weeks since the last outbreak of hositilites around at least four settle
ments in the area.
Iraq slowly losing in Gulf war
BAGHDAD, Iraq — After five and one-half brutal years of war with
Iran, the Iraqi army is faltering because of the lackluster performance of
its troops and political constraints placed on commanders by the govern
ment of President Saddam Hussein, according to Western military
analysts and diplomats here.
Despite overwhelming superiority in sophisticated armaments and
firepower and near total command of the skies over the battlefields, the
assessment of military experts here is that Iraq is slowly but inexorably
losing the war. Iraq's nearly 1 million men under arms, the military
analysts say. are simply not up to the task of resisting a fanatical Iranian
army that keeps coming at them, no matter how badly it is punished.
"It is all very sad. but Iraq proclaims victory after victory but is still
losing territory," said one Western military expert here. "They have air
superiority; they have the best and the most weapons; they talk a good
game of defending their homeland and issue a stream of optimistic state
ments. Yet, the fact is that since 1982, they have been steadily losing
ground, meter by meter maybe, but still losing."
Aquino case inquiry desired
MANILA — Pressure is building to reopen the investigation into the
1983 death of Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino as a senior
prosecutor in the case charged yesterday that deposed president Fer
dinand Marcos rigged the acquittal of 25 military men and one civilian
charged in the murder. -
Aquino was the husband of the country's new president, Corazon
Aquino, who came to power last week with the help of a military revolt
that forced Marcos to flee to the United States.
Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, co-leader of the military revolt,
called yesterday for a reopening of the case, saying it had "greatly
defamed the Philippines military."
Aquino's murder in August 1983 was the starting point of the wave of
organizing and protests that eventually put his wife in the president's of
fice. The new president has said she will seek the full truth about the
murder, but since assuming office has not treated it as a pressing issue.
No decision on a retrial has been announced.
Manuel Herrera, head of a panel of prosecutors in last year's trial, said
in a statement yesterday that it was a "failure of justice" and suggested
that a retrial would not constitute double jeopardy because the first one
was not valid.
He said prosecutors and one of the three justices who tried the case at
a special anticorruption court had attended a two-hour meeting at
Marcos' Malacanang presidential palace, where "the outlining of the
hows and whens of the trial" took place. Herrera compared the trial
proceedings to a movie where he "already knew the ending."
Craft visits Halley's Comet
MOSCOW — Halley's Comet, the legendary celestial object circling
past the Earth since the origin of the solar system, flashed into close-up
view yesterday for the first time.
Photographs from the Soviet Vega 1 spacecraft, orbiting within 5,400
miles of the comet's head, appeared on television screens at a Soviet
space center yesterday morning before a cheering crowd of scientists
from numerous nations. Photometric patterns shifted on the screen as a
bright yellow core came into focus, the first close look at the great
glowing ice ball that scientists had deduced was there.
"The size looks about three to four kilometers," about two miles,
droned the commentator. "Evidently, it is the nucleus."
For the scientists here, that initial confirmation was one of the morn
ing's most important events, to be followed by more tantalizing clues
about the size and density of dust particles being blown off from the icy
nucleus and frequency of waves of highly charged atomic particles.
Although the dust particles closer to the comet were finer and less
dense than expected, the spacecraft ran into a heavy jet of dust gushing
from the comet 25 minutes after it swung in for its closeup.
Brazil, Saudis agree to deal
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — In an arms-for-oil deal, Brazil and
Saudi Arabia have agreed to a $3 billion arms package that includes a
technological cooperation agreement, Brazilian sources said yesterday.
The agreement provides for the purchase by Saudi Arabia of 1,000
Osorio medium tanks, multiple rocket launchers and the Tucano T-27
airforce trainer, which Brazil already sold to Egypt and the British air
force, the sources said.
In addition to the sales, which are covered by a contract signed in
December, a Saudi military mission that visited Brazil's arms industries
this week laid the basis for a technology cooperation agreement.
The sources said this would include financial support for development
of advanced weapons, such as solid-fuel rockets and maintainance in
Saudi Arabia for the Brazilian weapons systems, including a tank spare
part plant to be built in Saudi Arabia.
Brazil's arms industries, based on the development of modern steel,
automotive, electronic and aeronautical industries, are the largest in the
developing countries. Teams from the Pentagon have been visiting the
factories for possible procurement of tanks and aircraft, which are low in
cost by U.S. defense industry standards.
ANC seeks S. African alliance
LUSAKA, Zambia — Exiled leaders of the main underground move
ment fighting white-minority rule in South Africa have indicated that
while the group is maintaining its hard-line public stance against
negotiating with the government, behind the scenes it is trying to form a
broad-based alliance that can pressure Pretoria into negotiating with
blacks about a new constitutional future. ,
Thabo Mbeki, publicity director of the African National Congress
(ANC), disclosed in an interview here that the organization was making
contact inside South Africa with a wide range of groups, ranging from
worried businessmen and white Afrikaner intellectuals to disillusioned
blacks holding office in the tribal "homelands" under the apartheid sys
tem of segregation.
"We are reaching out, exploring all these forces, trying to mobilize the
political weight of all of them to the point where Botha finds that he
can't go on confronting them in their totality and he says, okay, let's
talk," Mkeki said, referring to South African President Pieter Botha.
"At that point the ANC would be prepared to negotiate," added
