# Gorbachev shuffles Politburo
## 
### 
MOSCOW â€” Anatoly Dobrynin,
the Soviet ambassador to Washington
for the last 24 years, was transferred
yesterday to a top-level post in the
Communist Party's governing
Secretariat as Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev moved to consolidate his
control at the close of the 27th party
Congress.
In a departure from tradition, a
woman was one of five new members
appointed to the Secretariat as Gor
bachev put his stamp on the body that
has day-to-day responsibility for
governing.
Although Gorbachev's previous
reshuffling of the Politburo left little
to be done at the Congress, where
major changes usually take place
since it is held only once every five
years, he emerged from the nine-day
meeting with greatly enlarged sup
port in the party's Central Committee
and new allies on the dominant Polit
buro.
But one new member was added to
the Politburo, two octogenerians
were removed as non-voting mem

bers and newcomers were selected in
their place.
The largest reshuffle occurred in
the Central Committee, where only
171 of the 319 former members were
re-elected this year. A Central Com
mittee spokesman said about 40 per
cent of its members were newcomers,
apparently chosen by Gorbachev and
his advisers.
The 66-year-old Dobrynin's new
duties remained unclear, but it
seemed likely that he would take
charge of the Kremlin's relations with
foreign communist parties and advise
Gorbachev on issues involving the
United States. He has played a key
role in East-West diplomacy because
of his long experience with U.S. poli
tical leaders.
In addition to Dobrynin, other new
party secretaries chosen were Georgi
Razumovsky, 50, head of administra
tion; Alexander Yakovlev, 61, a
propagandist and Vadim Medvedev,
56, chief of the scientific and educa
tional institutions department for the
committee since 1983.
