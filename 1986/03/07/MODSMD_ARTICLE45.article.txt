# Panel rejects Reagan budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Republican-controlled
Senate Budget Committee, settling in for what
promises to be a long and painful debate over na
tional spending priorities, overwhelmingly rejected
President Reagan's proposed fiscal 1987 budget
yesterday.
Taking what was seen as a symbolic vote to
launch the committee's effort to draft its own
budget, half the panel's dozen Republicans joined
all of its Democrats in a 16-6 vote to reject the
budget.
"This is an exercise in president-bashing," Sen.
William Armstrong (R-Colo.) complained. The
Reagan budget, "though not perfect, is a
reasonable proposal," he added.
However, Sen. John Danforth (R-Mo.) insisted
the vote was not "in any sense a repudiation" and
called the White House spending blueprint "the
starting point."
The vote came as no surprise. Afterward, White
House Budget Director James Miller 111 said in a
statement: "I'm grateful that some senators voted
for the president's budget and that others ex
pressed support for many of its features."
As the Senate committee took its first series of
votes on the 1987 budget, the House was still
working to complete last year's deficit-reduction
effort. It approved a package of spending cuts and
revenue raisers that would cut the deficit by $6.8
billion for the remainder of this fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30.
More than two-thirds of the revenue would come

from settling a longstanding disagreement over
how much of the federal government's revenue
from offshore oil leasing should be shared with
states.
However, this provision, along with many others
in the deficit-reduction package, faces strong oppo
sition in the Senate and the threat of a veto by Pres
ident Reagan.
Congress failed last year to approve a beefier
version of the same bill, with savings estimates
reaching all the way up to $80 billion. As Congress
and the White House have bickered over the bill,
its three-year savings have dwindled to about $18
billion thanks in part to the deletion of a value
added tax on manufacturers to pay for the Super
fund program of cleaning toxic waste dumps.
Remaining in the bill, in addition to the offshore
oil revenue, is an extension of the 16-cent-a-pack
cigarette tax and the abolition of the Synthetic
Fuels Corp.
The bill would also expand a variety of federal
programs, however. As of 1988, for example, two
parent families with unemployed principal wage
earners could collect Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children in all states.
Separately, the Senate began debate Thursday
on a compromise version of a proposed constitu
tional amendment requiring a balanced budget. A
similar Senate-passed amendment died in the
House three years ago, but Senate sponsors ex
pressed confidence that the amendment would fare
better this time around.

The latest version includes several new features,
including language that would loosen restraints on
Congress' ability to raise taxes to maintain a
balanced budget.
This will be the amendment's first test since
enactment of the Gramm-Rudman law, which re
quires a balanced budget by fiscal 1991. If
Congress does not enact budgets that meet a
declining set of deficit targets, the law would force
automatic spending cuts in a wide range of federal
programs.
The presidential budget rejected by the Budget
Committee claims to meet the fiscal 1987 target of
$144 billion, but the Congressional Budget Office
estimates that it would exceed the target by almost
$16 billion. "They're playing games," Sen. Ernest
Hollings (D-S.C.) said of the administration
budget. "This is monkeyshines."
Senators also criticized the budget for relying too
heavily on domestic spending cuts rather than new
taxes or defense spending restraint. Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston (D-La.) described it as "unworkable,
mean-spirited and wrong-headed."
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici
(R-N.M.) voted for the President's budget, al
though he has said repeatedly that it stands little
chance of congressional approval. Domenici, who
has not yet offered his own plan, told reporters that
he intended to meet with the committee's top
ranking Democrat, Lawton Chiles of Florida, to
work out a bipartisan proposal.
"I'm hopeful," Domenici said.
