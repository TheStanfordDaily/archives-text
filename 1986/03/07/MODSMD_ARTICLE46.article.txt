Marcos seeks protection
HONOLULU — Exiled Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos, seeking protection against
political enemies controlling the government in
Manila, has begun investigating ways to quickly
become an American citizcn, a Filipino-
American community leader said yesterday.
Francisco Ugale, one of Marcos' leading sup
porters here, said Marcos has asked Honolulu at
torney James Stanton to research his eligibility
for U.S. citizenship under a 40-year-old law
giving preference without the usual long waiting
period to Filipinos who fought with U.S. forces
against the Japanese.
"The idea is, if the government of President
(Corazon) Aquino wants to give him some prob
lems, he would be better able to protect himself
as a U.S. citizen," said Ugale.
Meanwhile, the Aquino government yesterday
revoked the passports of Marcos and his en
tourange here. Notice was served in a letter to
U.S. immigration officials from Philippine consul
general Raul Rabe in Honolulu.

Reagan's stance blasted
WASHINGTON — Key Republicans as well
as many Democrats yesterday condemned the
hard-line, highly partisan approach that Presi
dent Reagan has taken toward Democratic oppo
sition to his request for $100 million in economic
and military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
Their complaints were raised as three more
committees of the Democratic-controlled House
voted on Reagan's proposal, two against it and
one in favor of it. Two House panels had voted
against it Wednesday.
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.), a member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a
frequent Reagan ally, said the president is hur
ting his cause by portraying the issue as "a disa
greement between the Republicans in white hats
and Democrats wrapped in red banners."
Democrats, meanwhile, were outraged at
being portrayed by the White House as commu
nist sympathizers for their opposition to military
aid, a tactic that Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.)
described as ' the moral equivalent of McCar
thyism."
