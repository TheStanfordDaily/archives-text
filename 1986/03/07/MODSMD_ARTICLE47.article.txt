Land linked to Marcos
LOS ANGELES — At least $10 million worth
of Southern California real estate, and probably
much more, was linked yesterday to associates or
relatives of ousted Philippine president Fer
dinand Marcos.
State Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Cypress) and
Los Angeles County Assessor Alexander Pope
said $8 million to $9.3 million worth of Los An
geles County property belongs to Marcos'
youngest sister, Fortuna Marcos Barba. and to a
former Marcos girlfriend, Dovie Beams Vil
lagran.
Carpenter assigned members of his Senate
Select Committee on the Pacific Rim to investi
gate parcels of land "which have apparently been
hidden behind all sorts of front names to conceal
the true nature of the ousted dictator's holdings."
Nixon speaks on policy
LOS ANGELES— Former President Richard
Nixon, saying his own policy of detente no longer
can be resurrected, called yesterday for a new era
of cooperation and competition between the

United States and the Soviet Union.
"We are adversaries, but we have one common
enemy — war," Nixon told a gathering of the Los
Angeles World Affairs Council in a rare public
speaking engagement.
The two powers "can never be friends; but we
cannot afford to be enemies . . . the Soviet Union
is a military superpower and deserves our
respect," he said.
Diplomacy between the United States and the
Soviet Union should focus on resolving differ
ences where possible and on developing "rules of
engagemer' Tor living with our differences rather
than dying over them," Nixon said.
Ad causes controversy
CUPERTINO — An advertising executive
says "people are reading their own sicknesses"
into an ad that critics say promotes bondage by
showing a pouting handcuffed model standing
beside the county sheriff.
"It was never considered in bad taste," said
Ross Carron, referring to the "Crimes of Fash
ion" ad his agency designed." I'd hate to think, in
our creative process, that we have to worry about
these peoples' neuroses."

The handcuffed model is shown in a
provocative position with her eyes closed,
wearing a slinky black evening gown. The hand
cuffs belong to Santa Clara County Sheriff
Robert Winter, who is shown lurking in the
shadows wearing dark glasses. A sheriffs patrol
car is in the background.
The ad, aimed to promote Vallco Fashion Park
in Cupertino, carried the headline "Crimes of
Fashion" and read, in part, "Her only crime was
looking good." It was yanked from the media
after complaints from women.
Patricia Townsend, Vallco's marketing direc
tor, said the ad was intended to spoof the idea of
police officers preoccupied with fashion, a notion
made popular by the hit television show, "Miami
Vice."
"Unfortunately, it was not taken that way by
some of our customers," said Townsend, who
conceived the idea for the ad.
It just might rain today
Prognosticators are predicting a chance of rairi
today. How much? We're not sure, but there will
be highs in the upper 50s through the 60s.
