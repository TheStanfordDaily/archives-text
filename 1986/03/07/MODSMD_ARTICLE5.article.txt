# VCRs invade Stanford life
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI 
Despite an ever-deepening public feeling of help
lessness in the face of new technology, one product
has made quiet inroads into Stanford, invading by
entertaining as it were. This product is the video
cassette recorder.
According to Robin Hensley, program coordina
tor for Residential Education, some of the most
popular items in the office are the VCRs. Res Ed

Feature

owns about 20 of the machines, all of which are
available to student living groups. Hensley said that
reservations for the machines are sometimes made
three weeks ahead of time.
Of 19 on-campus houses surveyed, all of them
either own a VCR or borrow one from Res Ed on a
regular basis.
The most popular overall use of the recorders is
educational, especially in dorms that borrow from
Res Ed. Many houses hire speakers whose talks are
augmented by a prepared video cassette. In addi
tion, Res Ed itself owns many educational video
cassettes, with topics ranging from rape education
to eating disorders to current events.
Recreation runs a close second to education.
Most of the houses surveyed have had a "Video
Night/Slumber Party," in which the RA or a group
of interested students from a house borrow the local Res
Ed machine, rent from two to five casettes and sit around
in front of the tube all night with consumables.
Because of its educational and recreational uses, the
VCR is considered to be benevolent technology. All the
house RAs agreed that the machine has provided students
with two things: entertainment and a sense of community.
"The whole dorm is very much involved with it," said
Trancos RA Mary Obana, a junior. "Ninety percent of
the time, it's a positive influence. It really does generate
conversation in the house."
"It's had a positive effect on (speakers') talks," agreed
senior Will Sutton, an RAin Schiff. "It serves to bring the
house together."
Schiff House typically shows a couple movies after
Wednesday night house meetings "to loosen up, kick
back," Sutton said. Members of the house considered
buying a recorder of their own, but the plan was rejected.
"It was a close vote, but people said if we could get one
free from Res Ed, why bother buying one?" he explained.
Do houses that own their own machine go overboard?
The experience of Adams House in Sterling Quad seems
to be typical. "It's used profusely," says RA Kathleen
Stewart, a senior. Two or three casettes are rented Friday
night and are left around for use during the weekend.
About six cassettes are shown during the week.
However, according to Stewart, there is a core of about
30 people who don't use it. Still, Stewart gives the effect

of the machine on the house an overall positive rating.
But even video gets fuzzy reception periodically. "We
encourage people to get out of the dorm," said Branner
RA Clay Calvert, a junior. "We use it sparingly." That
translates to once a week for primarily educational
purposes.
Calvert said he worries about "couch potatoes around
the TV and the whole bit. There's always something bet
ter to do on campus."
Indeed, the question of whether a dorm should buy a
VCR is often a controversial one. The experience of the
residents of Terra, a co-op in the Cowell cluster, and
senior Mike Hahn, its social director, serves as an example
of the pitfalls involved in obtaining such a device.
Terra, 50 to 60 live-in members and about a dozen
eating associates strong, is a working model of the effect
of new video technology on a group of people. Terra had a
color TV for a while, but all that anyone ever watched
were occasional "Hill Street Blues" episodes or "Star
Trek" reruns, according to house members.
Last quarter, Terra borrowed a VCR from the Row of
fice every Wednesday evening for its "Video Night" social
function. Hahn, however, was not particularly happy with
the arrangement: "It was just another planned event . . .
there was no spontaneity involved."
He hit upon the idea of the house owning its own ma
chine. Consequently, he spent much of winter break in the
video appliance sections of finer department and stereo
stores.

He discovered that a reasonable machine
could he bought for about $300, which meant
that if everyone in Terra chipped in $5 — the
price of admission to one movie — they would
be able to watch all the movies they wanted for
pennies a person. Ihe first week back from
vacation, he told his plan to the house.
Hahn began circulating a petition around the
house that asked lerrans to indicate whether
they wanted the house to buy a VCR. "About
80 percent ot the people (who voted) voted
yes," he said.
However, securing funds for the machine was
not so simple. Some house members expressed
reservations about having a VCR in the dorm.

A group of students
was clustered around
the TV. When asked
what they were watch
ing, a voice hissed,
' 'Blues Brothers.' Shut
up.'

Junior Tim Self, a former house manager,
pointed out that "The Row had three VCRs, so
we didn't need one . . . we could get one (from
the Row Office) anytime."
But Jeff Filiber, a former manager of the co
op, disagreed. "We can't get [a VCRJ in the
evening," he said. A vote was finally taken after
a few hours of banter.
The results of the voting surprised both Hahn
and Filiber. While a majority of the people
present voted for the purchase, the requisite
two-thirds majority needed for disbursement of

house funds was not achieved.
Self was concerned that, far from enhancing
the social life of the house, the machine
"wouldn't increase spontaneous interaction in
the house" and would ultimately lead to less at
tention being focused on planned social and
educational events.
So Filiber and a friend went around the house
gathering signatures to get the proposed pur
chase on the ballot a second time. As before,
not all Terrans were enthusiastic about the pro
posal.
For example, Terra resident Rebecca Mis
chel, a senior, was against the purchase at the
original meeting. "I literally never watch TV
during the term," she said.
However, after some politicking and discus
sion, the residents of Terra House finally OK'd
a plan to buy a house VCR. On Valentine's
Day, Hahn went to the Mountain View Gemco
department store and bought an RCA VLT3BS
with remote unit, 4-program/2-week program
ming capability and a beautiful metallic finish
for $339.
The result? Between 15 and 20 movies were
shown on the machine,during the first week, ac
cording to Hahn. "It's had a positive effect on
the house," added Filiber.
Indeed, last Sunday evening, a knot of about
a dozen Terrans clustered around the tube.
When asked what they were watching, a voice
hissed, " 'Blues Brothers.' Shut up."
For people out of the fray of the actual pur
chase, the mood seems to be a lackadaisical
thumbs-up. Sophomore Bob Spurlock, a Terran
eating associate, noted that "[Watching the
VCRj gives people stuff to do."
Self said he hopes the machine will be used
for educational as well as recreational purposes.
"Frankly, the movies shown on it so far haven't
been great," he said, and added that he would
like to see the VCR used to show more
documentaries and related programs.
Video has entered the global community, and
not without controversy. So it has entered Stan
ford student living groups — and Terra. Will the
co-op become more closely-knit? Come Dead
Week, with a quarter of neglected schoolwork
on their backs, will the students who live in
Terra go into a state of videomentia? Or will
repeated viewings of "Barry Lyndon" raise
them to a new cultural high?
Spring quarter, tune in and find out.

Because of its educational and recreational uses, the
VCR is considered to be benevolent technology. All the
house RAs agreed that the machine has provided students
with two things: entertainment and a sense of community.
"The whole dorm is very much involved with it," said
Trancos RA Mary Obana, a junior. "Ninety percent of
the time, it's a positive influence. It really does generate
conversation in the house."
"It's had a positive effect on (speakers') talks," agreed
senior Will Sutton, an RAin Schiff. "It serves to bring the
house together."
Schiff House typically shows a couple movies after
Wednesday night house meetings "to loosen up, kick
back," Sutton said. Members of the house considered
buying a recorder of their own, but the plan was rejected.
"It was a close vote, but people said if we could get one
free from Res Ed, why bother buying one?" he explained.
Do houses that own their own machine go overboard?
The experience of Adams House in Sterling Quad seems
to be typical. "It's used profusely," says RA Kathleen
Stewart, a senior. Two or three casettes are rented Friday
night and are left around for use during the weekend.
About six cassettes are shown during the week.
However, according to Stewart, there is a core of about
30 people who don't use it. Still, Stewart gives the effect

of the machine on the house an overall positive rating.
But even video gets fuzzy reception periodically. "We
encourage people to get out of the dorm," said Branner
RA Clay Calvert, a junior. "We use it sparingly." That
translates to once a week for primarily educational
purposes.
Calvert said he worries about "couch potatoes around
the TV and the whole bit. There's always something bet
ter to do on campus."
Indeed, the question of whether a dorm should buy a
VCR is often a controversial one. The experience of the
residents of Terra, a co-op in the Cowell cluster, and
senior Mike Hahn, its social director, serves as an example
of the pitfalls involved in obtaining such a device.
Terra, 50 to 60 live-in members and about a dozen
eating associates strong, is a working model of the effect
of new video technology on a group of people. Terra had a
color TV for a while, but all that anyone ever watched
were occasional "Hill Street Blues" episodes or "Star
Trek" reruns, according to house members.
Last quarter, Terra borrowed a VCR from the Row of
fice every Wednesday evening for its "Video Night" social
function. Hahn, however, was not particularly happy with
the arrangement: "It was just another planned event . . .
there was no spontaneity involved."
He hit upon the idea of the house owning its own ma
chine. Consequently, he spent much of winter break in the
video appliance sections of finer department and stereo
stores.

He discovered that a reasonable machine
could he bought for about $300, which meant
that if everyone in Terra chipped in $5 — the
price of admission to one movie — they would
be able to watch all the movies they wanted for
pennies a person. Ihe first week back from
vacation, he told his plan to the house.
Hahn began circulating a petition around the
house that asked lerrans to indicate whether
they wanted the house to buy a VCR. "About
80 percent ot the people (who voted) voted
yes," he said.
However, securing funds for the machine was
not so simple. Some house members expressed
reservations about having a VCR in the dorm.

A group of students
was clustered around
the TV. When asked
what they were watch
ing, a voice hissed,
' 'Blues Brothers.' Shut
up.'

Junior Tim Self, a former house manager,
pointed out that "The Row had three VCRs, so
we didn't need one . . . we could get one (from
the Row Office) anytime."
But Jeff Filiber, a former manager of the co
op, disagreed. "We can't get [a VCRJ in the
evening," he said. A vote was finally taken after
a few hours of banter.
The results of the voting surprised both Hahn
and Filiber. While a majority of the people
present voted for the purchase, the requisite
two-thirds majority needed for disbursement of

house funds was not achieved.
Self was concerned that, far from enhancing
the social life of the house, the machine
"wouldn't increase spontaneous interaction in
the house" and would ultimately lead to less at
tention being focused on planned social and
educational events.
So Filiber and a friend went around the house
gathering signatures to get the proposed pur
chase on the ballot a second time. As before,
not all Terrans were enthusiastic about the pro
posal.
For example, Terra resident Rebecca Mis
chel, a senior, was against the purchase at the
original meeting. "I literally never watch TV
during the term," she said.
However, after some politicking and discus
sion, the residents of Terra House finally OK'd
a plan to buy a house VCR. On Valentine's
Day, Hahn went to the Mountain View Gemco
department store and bought an RCA VLT3BS
with remote unit, 4-program/2-week program
ming capability and a beautiful metallic finish
for $339.
The result? Between 15 and 20 movies were
shown on the machine,during the first week, ac
cording to Hahn. "It's had a positive effect on
the house," added Filiber.
Indeed, last Sunday evening, a knot of about
a dozen Terrans clustered around the tube.
When asked what they were watching, a voice
hissed, " 'Blues Brothers.' Shut up."
For people out of the fray of the actual pur
chase, the mood seems to be a lackadaisical
thumbs-up. Sophomore Bob Spurlock, a Terran
eating associate, noted that "[Watching the
VCRj gives people stuff to do."
Self said he hopes the machine will be used
for educational as well as recreational purposes.
"Frankly, the movies shown on it so far haven't
been great," he said, and added that he would
like to see the VCR used to show more
documentaries and related programs.
Video has entered the global community, and
not without controversy. So it has entered Stan
ford student living groups — and Terra. Will the
co-op become more closely-knit? Come Dead
Week, with a quarter of neglected schoolwork
on their backs, will the students who live in
Terra go into a state of videomentia? Or will
repeated viewings of "Barry Lyndon" raise
them to a new cultural high?
Spring quarter, tune in and find out.
Despite an ever-deepening public feeling of help
lessness in the face of new technology, one product
has made quiet inroads into Stanford, invading by
entertaining as it were. This product is the video
cassette recorder.
According to Robin Hensley, program coordina
tor for Residential Education, some of the most
popular items in the office are the VCRs. Res Ed

owns about 20 of the machines, all of which are
available to student living groups. Hensley said that
reservations for the machines are sometimes made
three weeks ahead of time.
Of 19 on-campus houses surveyed, all of them
either own a VCR or borrow one from Res Ed on a
regular basis.
The most popular overall use of the recorders is
educational, especially in dorms that borrow from
Res Ed. Many houses hire speakers whose talks are
augmented by a prepared video cassette. In addi
tion, Res Ed itself owns many educational video
cassettes, with topics ranging from rape education
to eating disorders to current events.
Recreation runs a close second to education.
Most of the houses surveyed have had a "Video
Night/Slumber Party," in which the RA or a group
