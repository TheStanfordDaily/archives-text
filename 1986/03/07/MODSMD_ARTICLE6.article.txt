# Exercisers have longer lives
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
In what is believed to be one of the first scientific
reports linking increased longevity to an active life
style. a joint Stanford/Harvard study has revealed that
physically active men live an average of one to two
> ars longer than their sedentary counterparts.
Though the study does not fully explain why active
men live longer, Dr. Ralph Paffenbarger. the Stanford
epidemiologist who led the research team, said the in
creased longevity of alumni who exercise is probably
due to a reduced incidence of cardiovascular and res
piratory disease.
Paffenbarger stiessed that the public health implica
tions of the study's findings are significant. "If we com
pletely eliminated cancer as a cause of death, years of
life gained would be about the same — Americans
would live on the average onlv two years longer," he

said in an interview .
Nevertheless, Paffenbarger said that at first he was
slightly disappointed to learn that a physically active
lifestyle is associated with only about two additional
years of life. "I would have guessed that it would have
been longer," he said.
But Paffenbarger hopes the results will not provide
an excuse to stop exercising to those who enjoy it.
"Two years is a long time," he said. "Our computa
tions suggest that for every hour the active graduates
spent exercising, they lived that hour over, plus an ex
tra one or two hours."
In addition, the researchers pointed out that being
physically active often improves the quality of life, no
matter what the overall length of life may be.
The researchers stressed that the study does not
prove that exercise prolongs life, nor did it answer the
question of whether a change in life
style, from sedentary to active, can
prolong life. What it did show is that
the Harvard men who habitually
spent three or more hours per week
exercising lived longer, on the
average, than those who rarely exer
cised.
The increased length of life associ
ated with regular exercise was found
to be independent of factors associ
ated with shortened length of life,
such as cigarette smoking, high blood
pressure, extremes of body weight
and family history of early death, the
researchers reported.

The results also showed that the
alumni who lived longer were those
who remained physically active after
graduation. Men who had been very
active in sports during college but
later became less active or sedentary
did not live as long as those who exer
cised moderately throughout life.
Other results from the study sug
gest that smokers and those with high
blood pressure are at greatest risk of
death, but that being physically active
can lower this risk.
The study also revealed that
graduates who had a net weight gain
of more than 15 pounds after college
lived longer than those who gained
less than 15 pounds. This was a
surprise to the researchers, since the
men who gained more weight were at

greater risk for cardiovascular
diseases, which can lead to death
from heart attack and stroke.
However, they believe that the
low-weight-gain group didn't live as
long because "this represents a group*
of people who eventually die from
wasting conditions such as cancer,
neurological diseases and perhaps
diabetes," Paffenbarger said.
The study followed 16,936 Har
vard alumni, age 35 to 74, for a per
iod of 16 years. In addition to college
and medical records made available
to the researchers, participants an
swered questionnaires about their
personal health habits, including how
many hours per week they spent in
various types of sports and other
physical activities.

Since the study was restricted to
Harvard men, the results should be
extended to the population at large
only with caution, the researchers
said. "The Harvard alumni may not
be typical of the general population,"
they noted. "The bulk of these men
are cut from the same cloth — intelli
gent, educated and affluent," Paf
fenbarger said, "and in general they
live longer than the average
Caucasian-American of comparable
age."
The results are also inconclusive
for women, although Paffenbarger
noted that epidemiological studies
identifying characteristics predictive
of heart disease have revealed the
same ones for men and women. "So,
if you had to guess, you'd probably

suggest that these results hold for
women as well as men," he said.

epidemiology in the Department of
Family, Community and Preventative
Medicine at the medical school. His
colleagues on the study are Robert
Hyde, a Stanford epidemiologist; Al
vin Wing, a statistician-programmer
in the department of epidemiology at

of people who eventually die from
wasting conditions such as cancer,
neurological diseases and perhaps
diabetes," Paffenbarger said.
The study followed 16,936 Har
vard alumni, age 35 to 74, for a per
iod of 16 years. In addition to college
and medical records made available
to the researchers, participants an
swered questionnaires about their
personal health habits, including how
many hours per week they spent in
various types of sports and other
physical activities.

Since the study was restricted to
Harvard men, the results should be
extended to the population at large
only with caution, the researchers
said. "The Harvard alumni may not
be typical of the general population,"
they noted. "The bulk of these men
are cut from the same cloth — intelli
gent, educated and affluent," Paf
fenbarger said, "and in general they
live longer than the average
Caucasian-American of comparable
age."
The results are also inconclusive
for women, although Paffenbarger
noted that epidemiological studies
identifying characteristics predictive
of heart disease have revealed the
same ones for men and women. "So,
if you had to guess, you'd probably

suggest that these results hold for
women as well as men," he said.

In what is believed to be one of the first scientific
reports linking increased longevity to an active life
style. a joint Stanford/Harvard study has revealed that
physically active men live an average of one to two
> ars longer than their sedentary counterparts.
Though the study does not fully explain why active
men live longer, Dr. Ralph Paffenbarger. the Stanford
epidemiologist who led the research team, said the in
creased longevity of alumni who exercise is probably
due to a reduced incidence of cardiovascular and res
piratory disease.
Paffenbarger stiessed that the public health implica
tions of the study's findings are significant. "If we com
pletely eliminated cancer as a cause of death, years of
life gained would be about the same — Americans
would live on the average onlv two years longer," he

said in an interview .
Nevertheless, Paffenbarger said that at first he was
slightly disappointed to learn that a physically active
lifestyle is associated with only about two additional
years of life. "I would have guessed that it would have
been longer," he said.
But Paffenbarger hopes the results will not provide
an excuse to stop exercising to those who enjoy it.
"Two years is a long time," he said. "Our computa
tions suggest that for every hour the active graduates
spent exercising, they lived that hour over, plus an ex
tra one or two hours."
In addition, the researchers pointed out that being
physically active often improves the quality of life, no
matter what the overall length of life may be.
The researchers stressed that the study does not
prove that exercise prolongs life, nor did it answer the
question of whether a change in life
style, from sedentary to active, can
prolong life. What it did show is that
the Harvard men who habitually
spent three or more hours per week
exercising lived longer, on the
average, than those who rarely exer
cised.
The increased length of life associ
ated with regular exercise was found
to be independent of factors associ
ated with shortened length of life,
such as cigarette smoking, high blood
pressure, extremes of body weight
and family history of early death, the
researchers reported.

The results also showed that the
alumni who lived longer were those
who remained physically active after
graduation. Men who had been very
active in sports during college but
later became less active or sedentary
did not live as long as those who exer
cised moderately throughout life.
Other results from the study sug
gest that smokers and those with high
blood pressure are at greatest risk of
death, but that being physically active
can lower this risk.
The study also revealed that
graduates who had a net weight gain
of more than 15 pounds after college
lived longer than those who gained
less than 15 pounds. This was a
surprise to the researchers, since the
men who gained more weight were at

greater risk for cardiovascular
diseases, which can lead to death
from heart attack and stroke.
However, they believe that the
low-weight-gain group didn't live as
long because "this represents a group*
of people who eventually die from
wasting conditions such as cancer,
neurological diseases and perhaps
diabetes," Paffenbarger said.
