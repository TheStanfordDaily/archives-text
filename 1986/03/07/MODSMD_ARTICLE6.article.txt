In what is believed to be one of the first scientific
reports linking increased longevity to an active life
style. a joint Stanford/Harvard study has revealed that
physically active men live an average of one to two
> ars longer than their sedentary counterparts.
Though the study does not fully explain why active
men live longer, Dr. Ralph Paffenbarger. the Stanford
epidemiologist who led the research team, said the in
creased longevity of alumni who exercise is probably
due to a reduced incidence of cardiovascular and res
piratory disease.
Paffenbarger stiessed that the public health implica
tions of the study's findings are significant. "If we com
pletely eliminated cancer as a cause of death, years of
life gained would be about the same â€” Americans
would live on the average onlv two years longer," he

said in an interview .
Nevertheless, Paffenbarger said that at first he was
slightly disappointed to learn that a physically active
lifestyle is associated with only about two additional
years of life. "I would have guessed that it would have
been longer," he said.
But Paffenbarger hopes the results will not provide
an excuse to stop exercising to those who enjoy it.
"Two years is a long time," he said. "Our computa
tions suggest that for every hour the active graduates
spent exercising, they lived that hour over, plus an ex
tra one or two hours."
In addition, the researchers pointed out that being
physically active often improves the quality of life, no
matter what the overall length of life may be.
The researchers stressed that the study does not
prove that exercise prolongs life, nor did it answer the
