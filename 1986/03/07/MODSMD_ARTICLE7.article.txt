# Trustees to consider budget
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Campus construction projects and the University oper
ating budget — expcctcd to balance at $297 million for
1986-87 — dominate the agenda for Tuesday's meeting of
the Board of Trustees.
Submitted to the trustees for approval, the proposed
budget allows for faculty and staff salary increases above
the rate of inflation and an increase of $1.4 million
for academic computing, of which the largest portion will
go toward expansion of the Low Overhead Timesharing
System (LOTS) for students.
The University will consider measures such as further
internal budget cuts, reduced salary increases and higher
tuition increases if pending federal reforms require signifi
cant revision in the budget.
The largest of the four construction projects up for trus
tee approval is a plan to build apartment-style housing
that would accommodate 600 to 650 single graduate stu
dents and cost $22.5 million to $24.4 million.

An L-shaped site bordered by Bowdoin Street. Campus
Drive and Escondido Road and located behind Mirrielees
is recommended for the proposed housing by the board's
Committee on Finance and Administration and the Com
mittee on Academic Affairs and Development.
The proposed low-rise apartment units, to be shared by
two or four students, would have computer facilities and
feature individual bedrooms.
If the trustees approve the concept for the housing,
plans will be developed over the next several months and
submitted to the board for design and project approval in
autumn and winter. Construction would begin next spring
and finish in September 1988.
The project would be partially financed by increases in
student room rates of 0.8 percent above the rates needed
to maintain a constant level of servicc between 1986-87
and 1992-93 without building a new facility.
In addition, the University in December earmarked $20
million of a record $100 million tax-exempt bond issue to
help finance the project.
