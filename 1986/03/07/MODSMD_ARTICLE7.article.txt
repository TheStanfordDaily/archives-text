# Trustees to consider budget
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Campus construction projects and the University oper
ating budget — expcctcd to balance at $297 million for
1986-87 — dominate the agenda for Tuesday's meeting of
the Board of Trustees.
Submitted to the trustees for approval, the proposed
budget allows for faculty and staff salary increases above
the rate of inflation and an increase of $1.4 million
for academic computing, of which the largest portion will
go toward expansion of the Low Overhead Timesharing
System (LOTS) for students.
The University will consider measures such as further
internal budget cuts, reduced salary increases and higher
tuition increases if pending federal reforms require signifi
cant revision in the budget.
The largest of the four construction projects up for trus
tee approval is a plan to build apartment-style housing
that would accommodate 600 to 650 single graduate stu
dents and cost $22.5 million to $24.4 million.

An L-shaped site bordered by Bowdoin Street. Campus
Drive and Escondido Road and located behind Mirrielees
is recommended for the proposed housing by the board's
Committee on Finance and Administration and the Com
mittee on Academic Affairs and Development.
The proposed low-rise apartment units, to be shared by
two or four students, would have computer facilities and
feature individual bedrooms.
If the trustees approve the concept for the housing,
plans will be developed over the next several months and
submitted to the board for design and project approval in
autumn and winter. Construction would begin next spring
and finish in September 1988.
The project would be partially financed by increases in
student room rates of 0.8 percent above the rates needed
to maintain a constant level of servicc between 1986-87
and 1992-93 without building a new facility.
In addition, the University in December earmarked $20
million of a record $100 million tax-exempt bond issue to
help finance the project.
* Other construction projects up for
• trustee approval include:
'•A $1 million student center for the
♦ law school, financed by a donation
I from S. Mark Taper, would be lo
* cated between the south wings of
* Crothers and Crothers Memorial
t Halls.
• Construction of the proposed
♦ building is anticipated to begin soon
1 after the June 15 Commencement
• and will require about eight months
»for completion.
'•A $1.2 million PEP Beamline
♦ Facility for the Stanford Synchrotron
I Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) would
* be funded completely by the Depart
♦ ment of Energy.
* Part of the SSRL Enhancement
* Project, the beamline facility will
• consist of a concrete tunnel running
! to a 120-square-foot pit housing the
I experimental assembly. A 3,264-
«square-foot facility will cover the pit
*and accommodate an office, a
* restroom, a locker room, electronic
* control equipment and the beamline
; component assembly.
If the project is approved, con
struction would begin in late summer
'and take about six to nine months.
Expansion of the first floor of the
.Ruth Wattis Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building would allow for a 109-

person capacity conference center
with a large kitchen area.
The $1.15 million project would
also provide classrooms, seminar
rooms and administrative offices.
Construction would begin in May
and finish in September.
In other matters, the board will
consider approval of a lease
renegotiation policy for the Stanford
Research Park.
The policy sets criteria by which
the University can find lease
renegotiation acceptable with the
firms that lease parcels of land in the
research park.
Adopted in December 1981, the
Land Lease Guidelines under which
Stanford currently operates do not set
forth such criteria.

vance exactly what conditions would
bring about its enforcement. Deci
sions to charge someone with a viola
tion of any conduct rule always
depends on context — the specific
facts and circumstances of the situa
tion.
"Codification of (the guidelines for
enacting the PCD) would be undesir
able as well as impossible," he said.
Kennedy concluded the letter by
saying there is "wide-spread misap
prehension" that the PCD "exists by
administrative fiat."
