# Experts clash over Star Wars
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Two experts last night agreed that
technology required for the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) is uncertain
but offered differing views of the
feasibility and political desirability of
the controversial project.
In a debate with the acting deputy
director of the SDI, Sidney Drell, the
deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
told a Kresge Auditorium audience of
about 120, "The challenge of [SDI] is
primarily a political challenge. ... I
endorse a high-quality research pro
gram that's realistic and rigorously
consistent with the ABM (Anti-
Ballistic Missile) Treaty . . . but I
strongly oppose proposed major ex
pansion of this research and develop
ment leading up to large budget in
creases (for SDI)."
Proposed by President Reagan in
March 1983, SDI seeks to provide a
defensive shield against incoming So
viet missiles through a variety of
ground- and space-based weapons. It
is currently unclear whether SDI re
search violates the ABM Treaty, an
agreement reached in 1972 prohibi
ting the development and deployment
of defensive systems but allowing cer
tain research.
Jerold Yonas, chief scientist and
acting deputy director of SDI, de
scribed several of the technologies
being researched and said the Soviet
Union has achieved technological su
periority in some areas. "The Soviet
Union has done more than pursue re
search. They have the only strategic

missile defense," said Yonas, refer
ring to an ABM defensive system
around Moscow permitted by the
ABM Treaty.
The United States decided against
building a similar system and has his
torically relied on its nuclear forces to
deter an attack by the Soviet Union,
"but the Soviet Union apparently
does not have the same approach,"
Yonas said. The Soviets pursue a
policy of damage limitation through
maintaining the ability to disarm the
United States by a pre-emptive strike
and taking steps to construct a civil
defense, he said.
Yonas said maintaining the status
quo is in the Soviets' interests since
they are developing highly accurate,
powerful weapons capable of
destroying U.S. missiles in ground
based silos.
To overcome the Soviet threat,
Yonas said, the United States must
develop a strategic defense that is
cost-effective, able to survive Soviet
attack and able to overcome Soviet
countermeasures.
He noted several potential prob
lems with the technology but stressed
that the purpose of the SDI at this
point is to "pursue technology to pro
vide the basis for an informed deci
sion" whether to proceed with devel
opment and deployment.
Drell questioned the technological
feasibility of the system, asking, "Is it
realistic to develop a system that you
can't test under battle conditions, and
will the effort to develop that help us
in our effort to reduce the threat of
nuclear conflict?
"I'm deputy director of a very

simple device (SLAC) ... and I can
tell you, you don't turn on that ma
chine and have it operate. You have
to baby it for weeks to get it up to
snuff.
"When you're dealing with the
defense of the nation, you can't call
up the Soviets and say, 'Hey, wait a
minute. Don't shoot. I'm tuning up
my system.' "
Drell, also co-director of the Cen
ter for International Security and
Arms Control here, countered
Yonas' assertion that Soviet defen
sive research programs threaten the
United States. "I don't believe that
the Soviet programs in defense com
promise the U.S.'s deterrent capabil
ity," he said.
Among the steps Drell advised the
United States to take in order to im
prove its national security and
promote arms control were:
• to reaffirm its commitment to exist
ing arms control treaties including the
ABM Treaty;
• to carry out defense research
allowed within the limits of the ABM
Treaty in order to avoid being over
taken in the research by the Soviet
Union;
• to avoid technological demonstra
tions and tests that may give the
Soviets the impression that the
United States is violating the ABM
Treaty; and
• to pursue development of such pro
grams as the "midgetman" missile, a
small, single warhead, ground-based
missile that would offer the Soviets an
unattractive target and enhance the
United States' deterrent.

In a debate with the acting deputy
director of the SDI, Sidney Drell, the
deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
told a Kresge Auditorium audience of
about 120, "The challenge of [SDI] is
primarily a political challenge. ... I
endorse a high-quality research pro
gram that's realistic and rigorously
consistent with the ABM (Anti-
Ballistic Missile) Treaty . . . but I
strongly oppose proposed major ex
pansion of this research and develop
ment leading up to large budget in
creases (for SDI)."
Proposed by President Reagan in
March 1983, SDI seeks to provide a
defensive shield against incoming So
viet missiles through a variety of
ground- and space-based weapons. It
is currently unclear whether SDI re
search violates the ABM Treaty, an
agreement reached in 1972 prohibi
ting the development and deployment
of defensive systems but allowing cer
tain research.
Jerold Yonas, chief scientist and
acting deputy director of SDI, de
scribed several of the technologies
being researched and said the Soviet
Union has achieved technological su
periority in some areas. "The Soviet
Union has done more than pursue re
search. They have the only strategic

missile defense," said Yonas, refer
ring to an ABM defensive system
around Moscow permitted by the
ABM Treaty.
The United States decided against
building a similar system and has his
torically relied on its nuclear forces to
deter an attack by the Soviet Union,
"but the Soviet Union apparently
does not have the same approach,"
Yonas said. The Soviets pursue a
policy of damage limitation through
maintaining the ability to disarm the
United States by a pre-emptive strike
and taking steps to construct a civil
defense, he said.
Yonas said maintaining the status
quo is in the Soviets' interests since
they are developing highly accurate,
powerful weapons capable of
destroying U.S. missiles in ground
based silos.
To overcome the Soviet threat,
Yonas said, the United States must
develop a strategic defense that is
cost-effective, able to survive Soviet
attack and able to overcome Soviet
countermeasures.
He noted several potential prob
lems with the technology but stressed
that the purpose of the SDI at this
point is to "pursue technology to pro
vide the basis for an informed deci
sion" whether to proceed with devel
opment and deployment.
Drell questioned the technological
feasibility of the system, asking, "Is it
realistic to develop a system that you
can't test under battle conditions, and
will the effort to develop that help us
in our effort to reduce the threat of
nuclear conflict?
"I'm deputy director of a very

simple device (SLAC) ... and I can
tell you, you don't turn on that ma
chine and have it operate. You have
to baby it for weeks to get it up to
snuff.
"When you're dealing with the
defense of the nation, you can't call
up the Soviets and say, 'Hey, wait a
minute. Don't shoot. I'm tuning up
my system.' "
Drell, also co-director of the Cen
ter for International Security and
Arms Control here, countered
Yonas' assertion that Soviet defen
sive research programs threaten the
United States. "I don't believe that
the Soviet programs in defense com
promise the U.S.'s deterrent capabil
ity," he said.
Among the steps Drell advised the
United States to take in order to im
prove its national security and
promote arms control were:
• to reaffirm its commitment to exist
ing arms control treaties including the
ABM Treaty;
• to carry out defense research
allowed within the limits of the ABM
Treaty in order to avoid being over
taken in the research by the Soviet
Union;
• to avoid technological demonstra
tions and tests that may give the
Soviets the impression that the
United States is violating the ABM
Treaty; and
• to pursue development of such pro
grams as the "midgetman" missile, a
small, single warhead, ground-based
missile that would offer the Soviets an
unattractive target and enhance the
United States' deterrent.
