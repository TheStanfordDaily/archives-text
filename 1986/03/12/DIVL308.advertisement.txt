If you hear bullets ricocheting across
your living room, turbulent water falls
crashing down the stairs when you watch /
V, you possibly already have a Teledap- v
ter. However, if you don't, read on. j
If you have aTV and a stereo system 4
you can enjoy the excitement you've
been missing...now! The Teledapter's
unique electronics will combine your TV
and stereo into a powerful entertainment
center that would easily cost thousands
of dollars. Imagine having the best front
row seats in town for your ball games,
musicals, and movies.
Teledapter works with any TV, VCR,
or satellite receiver, regardless of age or
model, and conveniently plugs into the
auxiliary, tape, or tuner input on any
stereo amplifier or receiver system. All
TV, satellite, cable, and VCR programs
will have the same powerful sound as
your stereo system and speakers.
HOW
All Teledapters contain Stereo-Plex™ syn
thesizer circuitry for all mono TV's and
VCR's. It transforms their sound into
sparkling two-channel stereo effects. Got
a stereo TV or VCR? No problem. Just
plug them in (TE-250). Since most TV
and cable programming is mono, the
Stereo-Plex circuitry will pick up where
your stereo TV or VCR stops short.
Mono sounds, even when played
hrough two speakers, appear to come
:om one direction—the center.
Stereo sounds come from two
•irections.
