GOOD
! f JHL W/f The TE-100 Tele
® dapter has our Type
wMV 1 Stereo-Plex. syn-
U \ W thesizer circuit. Its
V / one isolated low
TE-100 impedance input
allows it to be connected directly to the
speaker terminals or earphone jack of the
TV, and then its left and right outputs
are plugged into the left and right inputs
on the stereo. The isolated input provides
total chassis isolation between the TV
and stereo for complete protection of
both components. The TV and stereo
may be located any distance apart.
BETTER
The TE-200 has all of the same qualities
of the TE-100, plus a Type 2 Stereo-Plex
synthesizer that gives more defined stereo
separation; plus a high impedance input
that allows the TE-200 to be connected
direcdy off your VCR audio output,
which is convenient if your TV doesn't
have any outputs; plus an output level
control for optimum level adjustment of
the audio signal.
BEST
The TE-250 has all of the qualities of
both the TE-100 and TE-200, plus a Type
3 Stereo-Plex™ synthesizer for even
greater defined separation; plus the latest
integrated circuit design; plus stereo inputs
that allow this unit to be used with a
stereo, VCR, or TV; plus a bypass fea
ture allowing the synthesizer to be cut off,
allowing a stereo source to pass through;
plus multiple inputs that expand the input
capabilities of your stereo; plus a tape
monitor loop that allows the TE-250 to
