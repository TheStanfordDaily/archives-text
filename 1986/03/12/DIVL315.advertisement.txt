MUSICAL NOTES
(Continued from page is) H t the ripe old age of 17, Charlie
% ■■ Sexton has already become a
Aft formidable presence on the
t* * '» Texas music scene, the hottest
young American in Europe and well on
this way to national stardom. He had his
first professional gig at age 11, toured
at age 13 as lead guitarist for Joe Ely.
He's recorded with Bob Dylan, Don
Henley, the Rolling Stones' Ron Wood
and Keith Richards and toured with
The Clash.
Despite the dangerous Matt Dillon
image that he projects in the video for
his first single, "Beat's So Lonely," in
person Sexton comes off as a likable,
slightly vulnerable teenage boy. His
Texas drawl is the only characteristic
that belies his foppish, Chelsea Street
clothes and teased hair. Charlie is like
most 17-year-olds; still experimenting
* with appearances and attitudes, ex
cept he's got a worldwide audience
watching his every move.
He's still experimenting with his mu
sic, too. His self-titled debut album is
competent pop, but not special. Under
the hands of producer Keith Forsey
(Simple Minds, Billy Idol, Psychedelic
Furs), there's too much Rick Spring
field and not enough Stevie Ray
Vaughn. Strange, too, this first album
of a guitar wunderkind doesn't include
a guitar solo. But there's enough of
Sexton that pushes through the over
production to alert the listener to stay
tuned for wonderful things yet to come. +
