# BRAZIL
## 
### 
Terry Gilliam doesn't play by Hol
lywood's rules. Brazil goes
against the American movie in
dustry grain, from its odd title to
its uncompromised ending. It's in keep
ing with Brazil's weird character that the
Los Angeles Film Critics named it Best
Film of 1985 before it had even been re
leased in this country!

Brazil, a curious talc of a dream struck
individual (Jonathan Pryce) swallowed
by .1 pett\ bureaucracy, almost never got
to American movie screens. Gilliam, a
dream struck individual it ever there was
one, stubbornly refused to go along with
Universal Studios' desire to recut Brazil
into something more upbeat. The studio,
in turn, held up the film's release in the
United States.
Petulant, headstrong and completely
original, Gilliam got his way in the end.
From his base in Fngland, the veteran of
"Monty Python's Flying Circus" waged,
and eventually won, a bitter public battle
for control of his film. Brazil was finally

released in mid February.
To Universal, Gilliam must
have seemed like an unruly
child and there's some truth in
that view. Gilliam on a film set is
like a 10-year old with a lifetime
supply of Lego bricks. During

filming in London, Gilliam, 44, bounced
around the playground—er, sound
stage with a fifth grader's unquench
able energy and transient enthusiasms.
To survey the set of his bizarre political
fantasy "Part George Orwell, part Wal
ter Mitty, and at the moment Orwell is in
the lead'' Gilliam leaped onto a camera
platform and climbed 10 feet up, hand
over hand. He gleefully peered from un
der his boyish bangs at the world of Bra
zil below.
The set was the marbled, high ceil
inged lobby of the Ministry of Informa
tion Retrieval, the ferocious bureaucracy
that rules the world. Below, a gang of ter

rorists, led hv Robert De Niro, were re
hearsing an assault on the Ministry.
"F generally describe Brazil in a pre
tentious way as a post Orwell ian view of a
pre Orwellian world," said Gilliam.
"That description bores everyone stiff, so
they leave me alone."
"So, what's it about?" he continued.
"It's about a dreamer (played by Pryce),
who tries to escape from reality. Ill leave
it to others to decipher the film."
Pryce, acclaimed for his portrayal of
Hamlet on the London stage six years ago
and for his role as the villain in Something
Wicked This Way Comes, says of Brazil,
"It will be like Gilliam's Monty Python
cartoons, which, in turn, are exactly like
him the tangible shape of his dreams."
Gilliam, who hardly ever sheds his sun
ny disposition, nevertheless has some
strange dreams. His last film, the interna
tional hit Time Bandits, though ostensi
bly a children's fantasy, ends with the he
ro's parents being burned to a cinder.
As for the title, Brazil, it seems there
was a popular song called "Bra/il" in the
'30s, with lyrics of the type that rhyme
moon and June. For Gilliam, the song
suggests t he romance craved by dreamers
in the cold, cruel world of Brazil.
Like other former Pythons, Gilliam has
worked hard to develop his prankish
mentality. "I like things to be a bit crude.
I revel in the way things are, not the way

they ought to be. My mind works like a
kid's mind, and that's not a pretty sight.
Everything I do is done to please myself.
That may sound egocentric, but it's all 1
know how to do."
Brazil is "more dangerous than Time
Bandits, more like rollicking bad
times,' " Gilliam warns. "Pryce's charac
ter finds that he can't escape reality. He
becomes a hero, but there's a price."
Gilliam was not delighted with the
need to fight for his film, once he'd fin
ished it and everyone agreed it worked

very well. "I'll go down in flames," he
vowed, as he orchestrated his campaign
"But I'm not interested in my career in
Hollywood. I'm interested in this film."
His relentless zeal and final victory
proved that in Hollywood if not in Bra
zil—once in a while the little guy can
win. 4



Lowry feels trapped in "Brazil's" world, a sort of
"1984" as performed by Monty Python.

Jonathan Pryce plays Sam Lowry,
a humble clerk in the vast Ministry
of Information Retrieval, where a
clerical error can shatter a life. He
escapes his bleak existence by
taking flight in his dreams.



Katherine Helmond plays Lowry's dominating
mother, Ida, a woman who owes her amazing looks
to plastic surgery.

Kim Greist plays Jill Layton, a cigar-smoking truck
driver who is Pryce's fantasy love interest.
