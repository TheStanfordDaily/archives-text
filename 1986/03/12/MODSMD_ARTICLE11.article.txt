Bits and Pieces ...
Band Aid will switch its emphasis
from music to sports in '86, ac
cording to Midge Ure, lead singer
of Ultravox and co-organizer of
the famine relief project. Ure and fellow
Band Aid organizer Bob Geldof are envi
sioning an international sporting compe
tition, not unlike the Olympics but with
out the nationalistic bent. Ure says the
event will focus on sports' inherent "ele
ment of entertainment rather than one
country battling against another ". . . If
you owned a new record company and
could sign any acts to seven year record
ing contracts, who would you choose
(the ultimate goal being, not your favor
ites, hut those that make the most mon
ey)? This is not a new board game but the
question posed in a recent survey of 20
top recording industry leaders. The sur
vey results included both expected and

surprising choices. Bruce Springsteen
was by far the favorite, followed by
Prince, Michael Jackson, Lionel Rich
ie and U2 in the top 5. Bryan Adams, Talk
ing Heads, Sting, Eury.thmics, Stevie
Wonder and newcomers Lone Justice, Ju
lian Lennon and Whitney Houston were
all included in the top 20. However, es
tablished artists such as Diana Ross, Neil
Diamond, Paul McCartney, Kenny Rog
ers, Elton John, The Cars, Hall and Oates,
John Cougar Mellencamp, Cyndi Lauper,
Van Halen and Tina TUrner didn't even
make the list.... A half dozen movie
soundtracks went gold or platinum in '85,
more evidence to convince Hollywood
producers that records sell films. The
soundtrack mania that began last year will
reach near hysterical heights this year
with nearly two dozen already an
nounced for '86. Among them are Quick
silver ( with songs by John Parr and Marily
Martin, Ray Parker, Jr., Roger Daltrey,
Thomas Dolby, Peter Frampton, et al),
Prince's Under The Cherry Moon, Talk
ing Heads' True Stories, Laurie Ander
son's State of the Union, and David Bow
ie and Sade's music for the British film
Absolute Beginners . . . Ch-ch changes.
Boz Scaggs is coming out of retirement
(he's now a San Francisco restauranteur)
and will release a new LP soon. Steely
Dan co-founders Walter Becker and Don
ald Fagen are re forming the band, cut
tinga newalbum and eventually going on
the road The Tubes, minus lead singer
Fee Waybill, have re-formed under the
moniker Inner Ttibes Singer Colin Hay,
minus his former band, Men at Work, is
at work with a new Aussie band.

recent survey of acts the
record execs would most like
to sign. However, idealistic
Irish rockers U-2 (above)
scored high with the decision
makers.
