# TEN BEST UNSIGNED BANDS
## 
### CHRIS MORRIS 
Where the hell are the Reducers?
Not around for deadline time,
explains their manager Ken
Evans—they're off beating the
bushes in their native Connecticut, play
ing a benefit not far from their home base
of New London,
And who are the Reducers, you may
ask? Though not exactly a household
name yet, the four members of the
band —guitarists Hugh Birdsall and Peter
Detmold, bassist Steve Kaika, and drum
mer Tom Trombley—have been together
for seven years.
The quartet has even issued a single
and cut three albums ( The Reducers, Let's
Go!and Cruise to Nowhere) for the small
independent label, Rave On Records.
I lowever, to date the group remains little
known outside of the East Coast colle
giate bar circuit.
All of this might change for the Reduc
ers. Last summer, College Medici Journal's
(CMJ) New Music Report (a "tip sheet"
that compiles the playlists of 400 college
and alternative radio stations, retail stores
and clubs) put out a call for tapes of un
signed American bands. WCNI-FM, the
radio station serving New London's Con
necticut College, sent in the title cut from
the Reducers' Let's Go/album.
Thanks to WCNI-FM's help, Let's Go
has netted a spot on a new album, Epic
I'reseuts the Unsigned, a unique project
which showcases, according to the liner
notes, "the ten best unsigned American
bands most likely to . .

You won't hear them on Top 40 radio, yet, but
local college radio programmers think these are
the brightest of today's new bands.

Even listeners get into the Unsigned
act, voting for their favorites via a postcard
enclosed in the I.l'. If the Reducer's barn
storming, guitar driven sound gets a
"thumbs up," the band could be handed
an Epic contract. That's a sure-fire ticket
to major label megabucks and that elu
sive prize, national recognition.
Nine other uncompromising and ob
scure American groups stand to become
the beneficiaries of the CMJ/Epic grass
roots scouting program. Epic Presents the
Unsigned uncovers a diversity of styles
and sounds, forged by previously unher
alded musicians who have paid heavy
dues in their local scenes.
Some of the bands on Unsigned art
well known outside their locales, but
haven't made the breakthrough to the Big
Time yet. Minneapolis' Sussman Law
rence Band issued a two-record indepen
dent LP, an Elvis Costello-influenced
work that spawned so much record indus
try interest that their presence on Un
signed was in doubt for a while.
The New Orleans-based Radiators,
composed of seasoned Crescent City
vets, have played with such giants as Dr.
John and Allen Toussaint. The group has
opened for top national acts, toured ex
tensively, and established itself as the
town's preeminent bluesy bar band.
The lesser known acts on Unsigtied
prove to be as original as their better rec
ognized fellows. The top entertainment
value on the record is supplied by Blue
Sparks from Hell, a six man outfit from
Scranton, Pennsylvania. Their "American
jive" a fusion of r&b, swing, Motown, and
jazz that the band calls "a cross between
the Marx Brothers and Mick Jagger," is

heard to hilarious effect on the Coasters
like comedy number "Real Man's Car.''
Hardly less impressive are the St. Paul
bar band, The Criminals; Alabama's new
wave/pop/rockabilly quartet, The Crime;
and Chapel Hill, North Carolina's quirk
pop quintet, the Pressure Boys. The
rhythm and-blues end of the spectrum is
covered by Cleveland's super-smooth Vi
sions, while The Rothchilds — actually
Toledo, Ohio's Tom Toth —and Connect
icut's Free World represent electronics.
The Unsigned compilation is more
than just a major-league exposition of the
American underground's do-it-yourself
record making principle; it's also a
unique example of a major label taking a
risk on college radio's ability to pick the
hitmakers of the future.
The entire project is the brainchild of
one of college media's biggest boosters:
Bobby Haber, publisher and editor-in
chief of CMJ's New Music Report. Haber's
seven year-old publication is a widely
read compendium of ultra-hip record in
dustry feedback, culling the hottest spins
from 250 taste-making college program
mers from across the country.

radio

stations," Haber says. " We tried to take
and collate their interest and informa
tion."
Haber took his idea of an album of un
signed bands to Epic Records in New
York, where he found an interested lis
tener in Frank Rand, Vice President of Na
tional A&R—the executive charged with
overseeing signings.
"There are kids making tapes who are
unaware of how to get them to A&R peo
ple," Rand says."And college program
mers are around music all the time —they
know what kids want to hear."
Given the go-ahead by Epic, CMJ solic
ited college programmers in July, ulti
mately receiving 275 tapes (during sum
mer break!) .The final cut to ten tracks was
made by CMJ and Epic staff members in
one marathon, all night listening session.
Epic Presents the Unsigned, has been
received so favorably by Epic, that anoth
er compilation is being discussed for later
in 1986. A postcard mail-in will again de
termine the public's choice for best un
signed band, and the results would be an
nounced at CMJ's annual awards
ceremony in New York.
"CMJ is really achieving its goal," says
Evans. "The alternative network is a fo

rum for new music—a way for some fresh
air to slip in."
With albums like Unsigned available in
record bins everywhere, a mere tapping
at the gate may now be enough to make
today's Podunk pub-rocker, tomorrow's
All American guitar hero. ♦
