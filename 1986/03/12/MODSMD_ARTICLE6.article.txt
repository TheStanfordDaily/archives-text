# CROSSROADS
## 
### 
In Walter Hill's Crossroads, two musicians
take to the road in the deep South on a quest:
Eugene (Ralph Macchio), a young man hop-
Uig to gain fame by rediscovering a fabled,
but long-lost, Robert Johnson blues song and Willie
(Joe Seneca), an old man willing to surrender his
soul to the devil in order to become a legendary
blues figure.

Fogether they flee the old man's dingy
I larlem rest home, crisscrossing the heart
of the Mississippi delta. Their destination
is ,i crossing, where two dusty, sunbaked
rc>ads meet, for a strange encounter under
■in old gnarled tree.
Along the road, they are joined by a
teenage runaway (Jami Gertz) on a quest
of her own.
Filmed mostly in the cradle of the
blues Greenville, Mississippi and the
surrounding Delta towns just of! U.S.
Highway 6 I Crossroads is about there
lationship between Eugene and Willie,
who share .1 love of blues music, and the

meanings of their evocative tunes.
Directed by Walter Mill, famous for
such bullet-paced movies as 4H Urs. and
Streets of Fire, Crossroads explores a fa
miliar theme, that of dream seekers who
end up finding themselves.
"It's really a sweet story about three
people, two of whom are learning from
each other on their journey through the
Mississippi delta and its music," says
Macchio, the Karate Kid turned young
guitar prodigy.
In this movie, he plays Eugene Mar
tone, one of Juilliard's most gifted stu
dents, who hopes to launch his own blues

career by springing upon the world a
missing Johnson tune.
He searches out Willie Brown (Joe
Seneca), the only living link to that blues
giant, and together they head down
South. Willie shows the ambitious white
boy that the only way to master the feel of
blues is to live like a bluesman.
"This is what it was like," the 24-year
old teen idol says, "Waking up in the
morning and not knowing where your
meals are coming from and where your
family's going and what's happening with
your life and then drinking Jack Daniels
for lunch."
Even though Seneca has never re
ceived any formal training in blues, he

contends that there is a blues world in
him, because of his experiences.
"I've observed and lived with blues
people. I think there are people who arc
aware of their roots and pay attention to
them. They will know that (inherently)
they belong to the blues group," Seneca
says with conviction.
Without such intimate contact, a musi
cian can never become a true-to-his heart
bluesman. "He's got to have more feeling
for the music," says Seneca, who played
an honest doctor in The Verdict and has
gained critical acclaim from a host of
stage roles on Broadway.
A catalyst of the* movie is Francis, a 17-
year old gutsy and vibrant runaway,
played by Jamie Gertz who recently
starred in Quicksilver. She sparks Eu
gene's drive to succeed and brings out his
vulnerability as well.
The heavily roots-influenced music of
Crossroads' soundtrack was produced by
celebrated slide guitarist Ry Cooder.
Cooder stresses that blues music has a
sound to which almost everyone can re
late. The fundamental qualities of the
music, he said, are its simplicity and abili
ty to make people feel good.
Although Director Hill and his stars are
coy on the subject of how the film's jour
ney concludes, it is evident that Eugene,
the white guitarist with a fervent desire to
play the greatest blues ever, adds much
more to his life than a mere song.
Crossroads will be released nationwide
by Columbia Pictures on March 21. ♦

Crossroads' soundtrack was produced by
celebrated slide guitarist Ry Cooder.
Cooder stresses that blues music has a
sound to which almost everyone can re
late. The fundamental qualities of the
music, he said, are its simplicity and abili
ty to make people feel good.
Although Director Hill and his stars are
coy on the subject of how the film's jour
ney concludes, it is evident that Eugene,
the white guitarist with a fervent desire to
play the greatest blues ever, adds much
more to his life than a mere song.
Crossroads will be released nationwide
by Columbia Pictures on March 21. ♦


Joe Seneca (background) and
Ralph Macchio (foreground)
play two musicians in search
of a legendary old blues song,
with Jami Gertz (center) as a
teenage runaway who joins
them. Macchio (below) looks
like a real professional on gui
tar, but in reality he took three
months of intensive lessons
to prepare for his role as a
Julliard classical guitar
student.
