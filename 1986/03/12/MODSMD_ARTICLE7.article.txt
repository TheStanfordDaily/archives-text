# NCAA Tournament: Hoops and Hoopla

College basketball's
spriag ritual Is bigger
and better than ever.

What do Bill Cosby, Pat Ewing,
Joan Collins, Larry Hagman,
Akeem Olajuwon, James Wor
thy, Shelley Long, Johnny Car
son, Cheryl Miller, Michael Jordan, and
Michael J. Fox have in common?
They're all television stars. And in
1986, someone like Walter Berry, Pearl
Washington, Brad Daugherty, Kenny
Smith, Roy Tarpleyor Mark Price will join
them after starring in one of the most ex
citing television events this year.
If you know even a little about basket
ball, you know we're talking about the
National Collegiate Athletic Association's
(NCAA) annual college basketball na
tional championship tournament. This
yearly celebration has grown from an ob
scure, regional .'vent into a gala tourney

rivaling the Rose Bowl in impact.
The NCAA, the governing body for or
ganized college athletics, began its na
tional championship tournament in 1939
with eight teams. When television joined
the celebration in 1963, with limited syn
dicated coverage of the tournament,
UCLA and its magnificent coach, John
Wooden, were creating history with an in
credible run of 10 titles in 12 years.
However, the tourney kept its insular
atmosphere, until NBC began telecasting
regular season games in 1975.
"Back when I played in the tourna
ment, it was a personal, localized event,"
said Billy Packer, CBS' respected college
basketball analyst, who played in the
tournament in 1962 and 1963 while a
guard at Wake Forest. "There was no co
hesiveness in the game because you rare
ly saw any of the teams from other parts of
the country. And the games didn't have
the impact they do today."
Most experts feel the tournament came
of age in 1979, the year two of the greatest
collegians in history met in the NCAA fin
als—F.arvin "Magic" Johnson of Michi
gan State and Larry Bird of Indiana State.
Magic was a personable, multi-talented
young man with an engaging smile and
presence who represented a big city at
mosphere. Bird, called "The hick from
French Lick" (his hometown in Indiana),
was a tireless performer, a magnificent

shooter and a hero in mid America.
If Magic and Bird gave the event star
appeal, a change in the number of teams
has given the tourney scope. It has grown
from 32 teams in 1975, to 64 this year.
Television's role in the 1986 tourna
ment will be expansive. CBS will be tele
vising the tournament for the fifth time,
and 19 games are scheduled to be tele
vised across the country on the three con
secutive post-season weekends. ESPN,
the around-the-clock sports cable chan
nel, will televise 20 through the regional
semifinals.
First- and second-round games will be
played at eight different sites March 13 to
16: Greensboro, North Carolina and Syra
cuse University in the East; Louisiana
State and the Charlotte Coliseum in North
Carolina in the Southeast; the University
of Dayton and the Indianapolis Metro
dome in the Midwest; and Weber State in
Ogden, Utah, and the Long Beach Arena
in the West.
The sixteen surviving teams will meet
in the regional semifinals and finals
March 20-23 at four new sites —the East at
the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey;
the Southeast at The Omni in Atlanta; the
Midwest at Kemper Arena in Kansas City;
and the West at The Summitt in Houston.
The four regional winners meet in the Fi
nal Four at Reunion Arena in Dallas
March 29 and 31.

Unlike last year, there is no dominant
player like Ewing, and no 1986 team can
feel assured of a berth in the Final Four.
There are at least a dozen that could walk
out of Reunion Arena with the NCAA title
on the last day of March.
The Big East Conference sent three
teams to the Final Four a year ago and the
Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) could
match that figure this season. The ACC at
one time boasted the top three teams in
the nation in the weekly wire service
polls—North Carolina, led by guard Ken
ny Smith and center Brad Daugherty;
Georgia Tech, paced by guard Mark Price;
and Duke, bolstered by the exciting Da
vid Henderson.
The Big East boasts the most competi
tive conference in the nation and could
send as many as five teams to the playoffs.
Syracuse is led by playmaking guard Pearl
Washington, St. John's has dominant in
side star Walter Berry, and Georgetown
has balanced shooters, David Wingate
and Reggie Williams, and coach John
Thompson, one of the nation's best.
Other teams with reasonable hopes for
an NCAA title include independents
Memphis State and Louisville, Oklahoma
and Kansas of the Big Eight, Michigan and
its star, Roy Tarpley, of the Big Ten, and
perennial Southeast Conference power,
The University of Kentucky.
The women's tournament will be held
at the University of Kentucky in Lexing
ton. Semifinals are on Friday, March 28,
and the final game, on Sunday March 30,
will be televised by CBS.
In women's basketball, look for num
ber one-ranked University of Texas' Lady
Longhorns, driven by point guard Kamie
Ethridge, and number two Georgia, with
1984 Olympian Teresa Edwards, in the
final four. Other teams with a good
chance to make it to Lexington are 1983
and 198-4 NCAA champion USC, with the
incredible Cheryl Miller, Louisiana Tech,
Virginia and California State University ;ii
Long Beach. USC is a sentimental choice
because this is the final year for Miller,
who almost singlehandedly has put worn
en's bastketball in the spotlight. ♦

1986, someone like Walter Berry, Pearl
Washington, Brad Daugherty, Kenny
Smith, Roy Tarpleyor Mark Price will join
them after starring in one of the most ex
citing television events this year.
If you know even a little about basket
ball, you know we're talking about the
National Collegiate Athletic Association's
(NCAA) annual college basketball na
tional championship tournament. This
yearly celebration has grown from an ob
scure, regional .'vent into a gala tourney

rivaling the Rose Bowl in impact.
The NCAA, the governing body for or
ganized college athletics, began its na
tional championship tournament in 1939
with eight teams. When television joined
the celebration in 1963, with limited syn
dicated coverage of the tournament,
UCLA and its magnificent coach, John
Wooden, were creating history with an in
credible run of 10 titles in 12 years.
However, the tourney kept its insular
atmosphere, until NBC began telecasting
regular season games in 1975.
"Back when I played in the tourna
ment, it was a personal, localized event,"
said Billy Packer, CBS' respected college
basketball analyst, who played in the
tournament in 1962 and 1963 while a
guard at Wake Forest. "There was no co
hesiveness in the game because you rare
ly saw any of the teams from other parts of
the country. And the games didn't have
the impact they do today."
Most experts feel the tournament came
of age in 1979, the year two of the greatest
collegians in history met in the NCAA fin
als—F.arvin "Magic" Johnson of Michi
gan State and Larry Bird of Indiana State.
Magic was a personable, multi-talented
young man with an engaging smile and
presence who represented a big city at
mosphere. Bird, called "The hick from
French Lick" (his hometown in Indiana),
was a tireless performer, a magnificent

shooter and a hero in mid America.
If Magic and Bird gave the event star
appeal, a change in the number of teams
has given the tourney scope. It has grown
from 32 teams in 1975, to 64 this year.
Television's role in the 1986 tourna
ment will be expansive. CBS will be tele
vising the tournament for the fifth time,
and 19 games are scheduled to be tele
vised across the country on the three con
secutive post-season weekends. ESPN,
the around-the-clock sports cable chan
nel, will televise 20 through the regional
semifinals.
First- and second-round games will be
played at eight different sites March 13 to
16: Greensboro, North Carolina and Syra
cuse University in the East; Louisiana
State and the Charlotte Coliseum in North
Carolina in the Southeast; the University
of Dayton and the Indianapolis Metro
dome in the Midwest; and Weber State in
Ogden, Utah, and the Long Beach Arena
in the West.
The sixteen surviving teams will meet
in the regional semifinals and finals
March 20-23 at four new sites —the East at
the Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey;
the Southeast at The Omni in Atlanta; the
Midwest at Kemper Arena in Kansas City;
and the West at The Summitt in Houston.
The four regional winners meet in the Fi
nal Four at Reunion Arena in Dallas
March 29 and 31.

Unlike last year, there is no dominant
player like Ewing, and no 1986 team can
feel assured of a berth in the Final Four.
There are at least a dozen that could walk
out of Reunion Arena with the NCAA title
on the last day of March.
The Big East Conference sent three
teams to the Final Four a year ago and the
Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) could
match that figure this season. The ACC at
one time boasted the top three teams in
the nation in the weekly wire service
polls—North Carolina, led by guard Ken
ny Smith and center Brad Daugherty;
Georgia Tech, paced by guard Mark Price;
and Duke, bolstered by the exciting Da
vid Henderson.
The Big East boasts the most competi
tive conference in the nation and could
send as many as five teams to the playoffs.
Syracuse is led by playmaking guard Pearl
Washington, St. John's has dominant in
side star Walter Berry, and Georgetown
has balanced shooters, David Wingate
and Reggie Williams, and coach John
Thompson, one of the nation's best.
Other teams with reasonable hopes for
an NCAA title include independents
Memphis State and Louisville, Oklahoma
and Kansas of the Big Eight, Michigan and
its star, Roy Tarpley, of the Big Ten, and
perennial Southeast Conference power,
The University of Kentucky.
The women's tournament will be held
at the University of Kentucky in Lexing
ton. Semifinals are on Friday, March 28,
and the final game, on Sunday March 30,
will be televised by CBS.
In women's basketball, look for num
ber one-ranked University of Texas' Lady
Longhorns, driven by point guard Kamie
Ethridge, and number two Georgia, with
1984 Olympian Teresa Edwards, in the
final four. Other teams with a good
chance to make it to Lexington are 1983
and 198-4 NCAA champion USC, with the
incredible Cheryl Miller, Louisiana Tech,
Virginia and California State University ;ii
Long Beach. USC is a sentimental choice
because this is the final year for Miller,
who almost singlehandedly has put worn
en's bastketball in the spotlight. ♦
