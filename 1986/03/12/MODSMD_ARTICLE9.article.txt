# PREVIEW
## OF SPRING MOVIES 
### 
ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS
The film set is magic. London,
Soho, the 19505, the winking
lights of the Club Panama, the
fake facade of the Last Days of
Pompeii, the Patisserie Valerie —the ren
dezvous of the nightswingers, the cool
cats and the disinherited.
Music pulsates through the sound stage
and a vintage Vespa disgorges Big Jill, the
Wizard and Dean Swift. Bebopping along
the- narrow streets are Mr. Cool, the Mis
ery Kid and the Fabulous Hoplite, while
Colin and Suzette, the leading characters
of Absolute Beginners, begin their sweet,
uncertain romance. It's Guys and Dolls
with a British beat.
The novel Absolute Beginners by Colin
Machines was a cult bible of the '50s. It is
set in the long, hot summer of the Notting
Hill race riots which eventually gave way
to the rule busting Swinging Sixties.
The film, according to director Julian
Temple, will cover this territory with an
unblinkered look. "It was a wonderful
time in English history. It was a peculiar
flowering, an escape route from the so
cial constraints."
Cast largely with unknowns, Absolute
Beginners is counting heavily on its I
"dream" soundtrack to attract an audi
ence David Bowie wrote and performed
the theme song, and Mick Jagger, Keith
Richards, Elvis Costello, Sade and Paul
Weller of The Jam are all featured.

HIGHLANDER
Inside an immense, cavern like garage
beneath Madison Square Garden, two
immortal warriors are engaged in a fi
nal battle. To end their 400 year old
struggle for a Prize which conveys ulti
mate knowledge and power—one must
behead his enemy.

Christopher Lambert, who played Tar
zan in Greystoke, is Connor MacLeod, a
16th century Scottish clansman. 1 lis story
begins when he survives what should
have been a mortal wound in battle with
an evil warrior, Kurgan (Clancy Brown,
the monster in The Bride).
He is visited by a flamboyant adventur
er, Ramirez (Sean Connery), who teaches
him that he is one of a special race of men
destined to battle evil—personified in
Kurgan—through the ages, to a final con
flict at a time called "The Gathering.''
That time is 19H6 Manhattan, where
Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne 1 lart), a weapons
expert, is busy combing the streets of
Manhattan for the cause of numerous bi
zarre headless corpses. She will be drawn
into the conflict between MacLeod and
Kurgan which will climax in the dark ga
rage beneath New York City.
Visually, Highlander promises to be a
feast for the eye, sweeping from historic
Scottish castles and villages to ultra-mod
ern Manhattan. Director Russell Mul
cahy's dynamic style also insures that it
will be a feast for action lovers as well.

AT CLOSE RANGE
At Close Range, starring Sean Penn
and Christopher Walken, is loose
ly based on events surrounding a
family gang, whose spree of mur
der, robbery and other crimes terrorized
the beautiful rolling countryside of Ches
ter County, Pennsylvania in 197 H.
Producer Elliott Lewitt brought the
idea to writer Nicholas Kazan, who—
making no pretense at docudrama —fash-
ioned a compelling script about a crimi
nal father and son.
Sean Penn, on seeing Nicholas Kazan's
script, immediately signed on. Director
James Foley, was equally enthusiastic.
"The story is incredibly rich," says Foley,
"the tapestry of emotion is so layered, so
complex and it's set against hard action."
Brad Whitewood, Jr. (Sean Penn) and
his brother Tommy (Christopher Penn)
live in debilitating poverty with their
mother and grandmother having long ago
been deserted by their father, Brad Sr.
(Walken). Brad Sr. is involved in crimes
ranging from murder to smuggling.
In an effort to impress his father, and
escape his poverty, young Brad organizes
his own gang. He finds it is a passage to
nowhere, and the film follows Brad Jr. as
he teeters between crime and the law.
At Close Range features powerful per
formances by Penn, Walken and Mary Stu
art Masterson as Bradjr.'s innocent young
girlfriend.

GUNG HO
Problem: The shutdown of a local
auto factory throws Hadleyville,
Pennsylvania, a small tight knit
community, into financial chaos.
Every business in town is either dead or
dying, while residents flock away like mi
grating birds.
Conflict: Hunt Stevenson, an ex fore
man at the defunct auto plant, engineers a
last-ditch plan to save the city. He flies to
Tokyo and lures powerful Assan Motors
into reopening the U.S. factory.
Hunt, played by Michael Keaton (who
has worked with Howard in Night Shift)
becomes an instant folk hero, "The Man
Who Saved Hadleyville." His counter
part, Japanese auto executive Takahara
Oishi (Gedde Watanabe, the wacky for
eign exchange student, Long Duck Dong,
in Sixteen Candles), suddenly finds him
self one of the most powerful men in a
small American town.
However, all is not well in Hadleyville:
cultural antagonisms simmer, egos clash
and different philosophies of auto manu
facturing collide.
Solution: Ron Howard, director of such
box office hits as Splash and Cocoon,
barges into this troubled Midwest town
and turns the impasse into a funny and
touching movie called Citing Ho.
Filmed in Pittsburg, parts of Ohio, To
kyo and Bueno Aires, Gung Ho is light
hearted comedy with a social message.

script, immediately signed on. Director
James Foley, was equally enthusiastic.
"The story is incredibly rich," says Foley,
"the tapestry of emotion is so layered, so
complex and it's set against hard action."
Brad Whitewood, Jr. (Sean Penn) and
his brother Tommy (Christopher Penn)
live in debilitating poverty with their
mother and grandmother having long ago
been deserted by their father, Brad Sr.
(Walken). Brad Sr. is involved in crimes
ranging from murder to smuggling.
In an effort to impress his father, and
escape his poverty, young Brad organizes
his own gang. He finds it is a passage to
nowhere, and the film follows Brad Jr. as
he teeters between crime and the law.
At Close Range features powerful per
formances by Penn, Walken and Mary Stu
art Masterson as Bradjr.'s innocent young
girlfriend.

GUNG HO
Problem: The shutdown of a local
auto factory throws Hadleyville,
Pennsylvania, a small tight knit
community, into financial chaos.
Every business in town is either dead or
dying, while residents flock away like mi
grating birds.
Conflict: Hunt Stevenson, an ex fore
man at the defunct auto plant, engineers a
last-ditch plan to save the city. He flies to
Tokyo and lures powerful Assan Motors
into reopening the U.S. factory.
Hunt, played by Michael Keaton (who
has worked with Howard in Night Shift)
becomes an instant folk hero, "The Man
Who Saved Hadleyville." His counter
part, Japanese auto executive Takahara
Oishi (Gedde Watanabe, the wacky for
eign exchange student, Long Duck Dong,
in Sixteen Candles), suddenly finds him
self one of the most powerful men in a
small American town.
However, all is not well in Hadleyville:
cultural antagonisms simmer, egos clash
and different philosophies of auto manu
facturing collide.
Solution: Ron Howard, director of such
box office hits as Splash and Cocoon,
barges into this troubled Midwest town
and turns the impasse into a funny and
touching movie called Citing Ho.
Filmed in Pittsburg, parts of Ohio, To
kyo and Bueno Aires, Gung Ho is light
hearted comedy with a social message.

Christopher Lambert readies for "The Gathering"
and his final conflict in Highlander.


Colin and Suzette are
Absolute Beginners in
an uncertain romance
set in the 50s.
ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS
The film set is magic. London,
Soho, the 19505, the winking
lights of the Club Panama, the
fake facade of the Last Days of
Pompeii, the Patisserie Valerie —the ren
dezvous of the nightswingers, the cool
cats and the disinherited.
Music pulsates through the sound stage
and a vintage Vespa disgorges Big Jill, the
Wizard and Dean Swift. Bebopping along
the- narrow streets are Mr. Cool, the Mis
ery Kid and the Fabulous Hoplite, while
Colin and Suzette, the leading characters
of Absolute Beginners, begin their sweet,
uncertain romance. It's Guys and Dolls
with a British beat.
The novel Absolute Beginners by Colin
Machines was a cult bible of the '50s. It is
set in the long, hot summer of the Notting
Hill race riots which eventually gave way
to the rule busting Swinging Sixties.
The film, according to director Julian
Temple, will cover this territory with an
unblinkered look. "It was a wonderful
time in English history. It was a peculiar
flowering, an escape route from the so
cial constraints."
Cast largely with unknowns, Absolute
Beginners is counting heavily on its I
"dream" soundtrack to attract an audi
ence David Bowie wrote and performed
the theme song, and Mick Jagger, Keith
Richards, Elvis Costello, Sade and Paul
Weller of The Jam are all featured.

HIGHLANDER
Inside an immense, cavern like garage
beneath Madison Square Garden, two
immortal warriors are engaged in a fi
nal battle. To end their 400 year old
struggle for a Prize which conveys ulti
mate knowledge and power—one must
behead his enemy.

Christopher Lambert, who played Tar
zan in Greystoke, is Connor MacLeod, a
16th century Scottish clansman. 1 lis story
begins when he survives what should
have been a mortal wound in battle with
an evil warrior, Kurgan (Clancy Brown,
the monster in The Bride).
He is visited by a flamboyant adventur
er, Ramirez (Sean Connery), who teaches
him that he is one of a special race of men
destined to battle evil—personified in
Kurgan—through the ages, to a final con
flict at a time called "The Gathering.''
That time is 19H6 Manhattan, where
Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne 1 lart), a weapons
expert, is busy combing the streets of
Manhattan for the cause of numerous bi
zarre headless corpses. She will be drawn
into the conflict between MacLeod and
Kurgan which will climax in the dark ga
rage beneath New York City.
Visually, Highlander promises to be a
feast for the eye, sweeping from historic
Scottish castles and villages to ultra-mod
ern Manhattan. Director Russell Mul
cahy's dynamic style also insures that it
will be a feast for action lovers as well.
