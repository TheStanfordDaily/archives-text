Here's how to make
sure you receive parts
that are made to work
best in your GM car. Your
most reliable source is your
GM dealer. He can supply
any part for your GM car or
truck. Buying popular brand
parts from reputable stores
or garages is another way
to improve your chances of
getting the right part. But
wherever you buy, be sus
picious of discounts that
seem too good to be true.
Some tip-offs that a
part might be counterfeit:
Flimsy packaging.
Lack of name-brand
identification such as
AC-Delco.
"L(X)k-alike" graphics or
a change in the spelling of a
recognized trade name. In
this way counterfeiters can
avoid prosecution under the
1984 Trademark Counter
feiting Law. So examine the
package carefully.
If a replacement part
doesn't fit easily, you should
probably return it. A repu
table distributor will almost
certainly give you a refund
or credit.
General Motors is tak
ing strong measures in the
U.S. and overseas to put a
stop to parts counter
feiting. GM is trying to stop
the problem at its source.
