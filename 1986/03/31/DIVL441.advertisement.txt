So far we've helped U.S.
marshals confiscate parts in
raids on 29 counterfeiting
operations. Another eight
operations have been un
covered and prosecuted in
foreign countries.
GM is also developing
a hologram identification
device, much like those be
coming popular on credit
cards, to improve security
in our parts distribution.
After all, General
Motors has a tremendous
investment in GM parts that
work together to give our
customers safe, reliable cars
and trucks. We want our cus
tomers to be confident they
can maintain their GM vehi
cles at the same level of
high quality we build them.
This advertisement is part of
our continuing effort to give
customers useful information
about their cars and trucks
and the company that builds
them.
