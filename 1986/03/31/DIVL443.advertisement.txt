"Skipped"
I W Heartbeat
A "skipped" heartbeat is
sometimes used to describe
an irregularity, or arrythmia,
in the heartbeat rhythm.
Heartbeats or contractions
normally start from spon
taneous excitation of a
special group of cells known
as the pacemaker node. The
heart beats only as much as
it needs to in order to pump
the proper amount of blood. If
it beats twice in too rapid
succession (an arrythmia) it
may then pause briefly to
pick up the normal rate of
beating. These arrythmias
are generally not harmful,
and do not require treatment
unless they occur frequently
and cause alarm or
discomfort.
