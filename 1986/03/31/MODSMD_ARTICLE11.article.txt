Spring Break activities:
Fighting fierce, ornery mountain
lions in the harsh Utah desert, while
Rod Stewart blared on my portable
tape player.
Staying in Death Valley and sleep
ing in a huge barbecue pit, waking up
only when the natives began to cook
their breakfast.
Getting knifed by an American
midget CIA agent.
Rooming with Grace Jones in a
seedy Mexican hotel.
Believe it or not.
