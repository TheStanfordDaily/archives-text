# IAC changes placed on hold

### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
In response to a torum criticizing proposed changes in
the Innovative Academic Courses office, lAC administra
tors have decided to postpone staff layoffs in the SWOPSI
program until June, according to SWOPSI faculty co
director Jack Winkler.
The administrators have also requested that the
SWOPSI Policy Board prepare recommendations for
changing the program, Winkler said.
"(The SWOPSI Policy Board) is going to function as a
sort of safety valve and a governance check" for decisions
affecting the program, said Winkler, a professor of clas
sics.
Winkler and Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergraduate
Studies and associate professor of history, spoke at the
March 13 torum sponsored by the Ad Hoc Task Force in
Support of lAC, a group of students, faculty and staff that
have voiced concern over the program changes. About 40
people attended.
SWOPSI, or Stanford Workshops on Political and So
cial Issues, is under the jurisdiction of I AC along with Un
dergraduate Special Programs and Freshman-Sophomore
Seminars. The SWOPSI Policy Board is a group of 13 fac
ulty, students and community members that "determines
the direction" of the program, Lougee said.
Winkler and Lougee announced earlier this month that
SWOPSI professional co-director Andre Burnett and pro
gram coordinator Barbara Jurin-Reid would be laid off
ellective April 15. A full-time "scholar-activist" would be
hired in the place of the two staff members.
Lougee said she called a meeting of the SWOPSI board
the day following the forum and later agreed to the
board's two requests — that the layoffs be postponed to

the end of the year and that the search process for a re
placement be put on hold until the board could make its
recommendation. She stressed that the board did not ask
her to reinstate the two staff members who were laid off.
"The decision (to lay off Burnett and Jurin-Reid) is not
going to be reversed," she added.
Jurin-Reid and Burnett could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
Lougee said she has requested the board to make
recommendations that would strengthen the program
"rather than a simple perpetuation of the current situa
tion."
According to Winkler, "If (Policy Board members) rec
ommend something different than I have, (Lougee) will
listen to them."
Lougee concurred, saying that the board's recommen
dations will be "advisory" and adding that she will have
the final decision.
Winkler said he "didn't succeed in persuading stu
dents" of his proposal at the forum and that prompted
him to "ask the board to take charge."
"It's out of my hands," he said. "Thirteen interested
persons who are the board will tell me where I'm right and
where I'm wrong."
Lougee said that "one of the criticisms that was brought
up (at the forum) was that whereas generally staffing deci
sions were administrative matters, SWOPSI was different
.. . because it is a collaborative effort."
The "point was well taken," she said, adding that it led
to the decision to turn to the board for a recommendation.
When asked for the reason for the staff layoffs, Lougee
said the decision was made in line with "our sense that the
academic strength of the program required someone with
a proto-faculty expertise" in political and social issues.
