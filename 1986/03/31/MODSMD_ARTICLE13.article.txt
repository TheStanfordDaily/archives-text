# Student plans to sue bar
## 
### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
Stanford student Atticus Tysen
has announced plans to sue a
nearby bar for being stopped from
dancing with another male.
Tysen, a junior English major
and gay activist, and 1983 Stanford
graduate Rhio Hiersch will file suit
against Boomer's in Redwood City
for the confrontation with bar
employees. The two men said their
civil rights were violated and called
the incident a case of discrimination
against homosexuals.
"I was astonished. 1 have the
same right as anyone else to dance
with a friend," Tysen said.
On Friday, March 7, Tysen and
Hiersch joined a number of hetero
sexual couples on the dance floor at
Boomer's. After dancing for about
three minutes, the two gay men
were interrupted by a bar em
ployee.
Hiersch quoted the employee as
saying, "We don't do that shit
around here anymore." Another
employee approached and the two
physically removed Hiersch and
Tysen from the floor.

The bar then called the police to
have the two men removed. One
San Mateo County Sheriffs deputy
and six Redwood City police offi
cers responded to the disturbance
complaint, but no arrests were
made.
Tysen and Hiersch spoke with
the officers outside the bar and
then were allowed to reenter the
establishment to finish their drinks.
Boomer's had been a gay bar for
over 15 years under various names,
including The Bayou Lounge, The
Answer, and most recently,
Revenge. After a two-week
closure, the establishment
reopened March 6, with advertising
featuring graphics of heterosexual
couples.
Calls placed to Boomer's yester
day by The Daily were not
returned.
Both Hiersch and Tysen have
hired Bruce Nickerson, a well
known gay rights attorney in San
Jose, to represent them in their ac
tions against Boomer's.
They plan to send a letter to the
bar asking for damages for the inci
dent as well as a published apology
and a promise that the incident

would never happen again.
Hiersch could not elaborate on
the exact details of the damage re
quest, but said it would be
"something that would remind
them that [their actions] were un
called for and totally disrespectful."
Leonard Graff, legal director of
National Gay Rights Advocates in
San Francisco, supports Hiersch
and Tysen in their suit. In an inter
view with the Bay Area Reporter, a
weekly gay newspaper, Graff said,
"No doubt about it, people should
go to court to enforce their rights.
"When owners of establishments
are sued, they will learn first-hand
that they can't discriminate. And it
will send a message to other busi
ness owners, too," he said.
According to Graff, the Unruh
Civil Rights Act makes discrimina
tion by tavern owners against gay
people and same-sex couples a
violation of California law.
Tysen is a member of the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
and the board of directors for
Western States Lesbian and Gay
Students United. Hiersch is the
founder of the Peninsula Gay and
Lesbian Youth Group in Palo Alto.
