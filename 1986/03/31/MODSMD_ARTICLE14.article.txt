## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Springtime on the Farm 
### 
You have good intentions.
You grab your beach towel, sunglasses and your
backpack full of books. You go out to your favorite
spot — be it Wilbur Beach, the roof of Toyon, Lake
Lag or the Oval. You settle in, pull out your books and
attempt to get some work done.
And then you start to doze off while soaking in the
sun.
Welcome to spring quarter at Stanford.
Spring on the Farm is unique. It is the most eagerly
anticipated and talked about quarter of the school
year. It is the glimmer of hope, the impetus to push one
through a bleak winter quarter. This is the quarter you
daydreamed about while you were studying for winter
quarter finals. Just when you were feeling over-worked
and soggy from too much winter rain, you pondered
the coming spring and it helped get you through.
You aren't the only one to be inspired by this season
ot flowers and sunshine. Shakespeare wrote a complete
sonnet called "To Spring," and other writers ranging
from Charles Dickens to William Carlos Williams have
expressed the joy of spring in their works.
Although spring at Stanford, like spring in general, is
often glorified, it does have its share of pitfalls. It's the
time for windsurfing and sailing on Lake Lag. But it's
also the time for getting thrown in with your clothes
on. It's the time for big all-campus, all-day parties —
the Beta Nooner, Splendor on the Grass, Aqua Follies.

It's also a time for more hangovers than you may have
aspirin for. It's a time to enjoy the fruits of the winter
rains — to smell the sweet aroma of springtime blos
soms. It's also the time for your allergies to act up.
Stanford spring means IM softball, and TAs holding
sections outside on the Quad. It means walking into
the caterpillar-like bugs hanging from the trees. It
means an en masse trip to the Bay to Breakers 10K
Run in the city, or a Grateful Dead concert in Frost
Amphitheatre. It means finding inventive places to
study while simultaneously bagging rays. Spring quar
ter means a tan.
Spring is a time of renewal, of optimism brought on
by warmer temperatures and sunshine. People warm
up, too. Expect more waves and smiles as people pass
you on their bikes. The spring attitude is contagious.
Other things may heat up in springtime; romance or
political activism.
Take advantage of this change of season to make
some changes in yourself. Take stock of yourself —
make it a sort of personal spring cleaning. Try some
thing new, take a class you never would have taken
before, take a walk to the Dish at sunset, be more or
ganized, inquisitive, positive. Open your eyes and look
around a little more.
Spring fever is going around. Catch it and be zealous
about it. Enjoy this unique quarter in your own way.
Because everything has its season.
