## 'Noise' needed for change 
### 
In his argument that those interested in change should
"make a difference, not just noise," Allen C. Estes (The
Daily, Mar. 3) mistakenly draws a dichotomy between
these notions, failing to recognize that making noise is a
key part of making a difference.
Yes, we need policy planners, committee-joiners,
people who will diplomatically go-through-the-channels
to institute change, make rules, amend laws. But we
likewise need those among us who will march in the
streets, who will scream and make ugly displays about in
justice, who will raise hell about what they find wrong.
While program planning and law-making can be quan
tified, easily argued as "productive," the more amorphous
consciousness-raising that stems from "making noise" is
equally important, perhaps even more so, in laying the
groundwork for change.

In an insightful essay entitled "The Rhetoric of Histori
cal Movements," Leland Griffin argues that movements
need to make noise: in the identification of an enemy, in
the rejection of old idols, in the creation of symbols of a
new order, in the use of often violent language, in the use
of any available means of persuasion to achieve their
goals.
The Civil Rights Act made the law books, but who can
deny the essential consciousness-raising of Americans
that resulted from the symbolic acts, the noise-making, of
Rosa Parks taking her seat in the front of the bus, of Mar
tin Luther King, Jr., writing from jail and speaking from
Washington, of countless Civil Rights marchers taking to
the streets?
Who can deny the emotional impact on the American
masses who watched and heard through the media as
Vietnam veterans in wheelchairs ripped medals from their
chests and heaved them on to the White House lawn? As
students staged sit-ins and takeovers? As a group of nuns
prostrated themselves on the altar of a New York City ca
thedral because the Catholic Church would not come out
against the Vietnam War? (So much noise.)
High school girls today compete in sports that never

existed for girls even a decade ago; they hold leadership
positions in clubs and councils; they set goals their mot
hers never dreamed of. And yes, it took some
"productive" acts: law suits and legislation. But to make
administrators and lawmakers aware of the problems and
inequities, it also took bra-burnings, angry rhetoric, years
of making noise.
And what of the noise-making recently in the streets of
the Philippines? The impact of citizens shouting their
rage, yet embracing Ferdinand Marcos' soldiers with
flowers, symbols of peace and unity?
One night a few weeks ago, I stared at the mass of
names on the half-size model of the Vietnam Memorial
and wept when I read the journals filled with the inspired
words of countless visitors to the memorial. Fathers who
can t spend a day without missing their lost sons. Ex
girlfriends, now mothers, praying their sons never pay
such a price. Veterans plagued still by memories of broth
ers blown apart.
When President Ray-Guns (note: identification of
enemy, angry rhetoric) decides how many drafted 18-year
olds to send into combat in Central America or in the
Middle East, he and other powers-that-be will call the
shots. But this memorial and these journals filled with
poems and dedications and rhetoric, so much noise, will
serve to remind many of us of the price, of the aftermath.
Before that day comes, I hope some of us will hold posi
tions of power and will steer this country toward peace.
But if the warmongers push us toward battle, I hope many
of us will make noise. Lots of it. Even on our lovely
campus. Interrupting lectures. Shouting and making ugly
displays in White Plaza. Rudely performing anti-war
guerrilla theater in the fountains.
Saying, as are some of our protesters today, that all of
us, all of us must take these issues to heart, must demon
strate to those in power our disapproval.
Till even those like Estes, content to criticize protest as
no more than campus chic, will understand that through
rhetoric, through symbolic acts, through our noise, we
make a difference.
