Hoover not logical
1 have noted that the defenders of
the Hoover Institution regularly
make use of specious logic as a means
of discrediting and silencing their crit
ics while perversely accusing them of
the self-same behavior. A previous
example was from a Mr. Gann who
asserted that experiencing oppression
gave one no special knowledge of
oppression (he should read "Invisible
Man" and "Black Like Me") and that
such outlooks should not be part of a
"reasoned" debate. Mr. Gann also
sought to bar considerations of
sexism, racism and facism as
meaninglessly pejorative when, in
fact, the terms all refer to those who
would engage in prejudicial exclu
sion.
The most recent example from
John McCarthy (The Daily. Mar. 4
and 6) is particularly abhorrent. He
suggests that the study objected to by
the 16 Stanford professors was a
piece of objective research offensive
only to homosexuals with no taste for
the truth. In fact it was a proposal to
"prove" that AIDS is transmitted by
casual contact, presumably whether it
is true or not and in the face of
available evidence that it is not. The
proposal went on to outline how such
a finding could be used to justify ex
ercises in power that might exceed
even limits imposed by the Constitu
tion. (All yours for only 512.5 million
of the taxpayers' money.) The specter

of Sen. Joe McCarthy, who sought to
enhance his personal power with lies
exacerbating fear, would seem to
more clearly apply to this proposal
than to its detractors.
History has well confirmed that:
"Those who can make you believe
absurdities can make you commit
atrocities." It is important to objec
tively determine who is dishing out
the absurdities.

Coffee House regular
Victor Hill case is
going to arbitrator
In Dwight Ost's letter of Mar. 7, he
contends that Victor Hill, as a United
Stanford Worker member, was fired
unjustly last October for allegedly
slashing Stores Manager Hector Al
len's tires. Ost contends that justice
has been denied for Hill.
The University believes that Hill
was discharged for just cause:
however, the issue of whether or not
it was just is being heard in accor
dance with the grievance and arbitra
tion procedure provided by the USW
contract. Hill's case is currently pend
ing arbitration. The arbitrator, selec
ted jointly by the University and
USW, will make the final decision.
The University will be bound by that
decision.
Ost concludes that there will be no

justice until Hill is reinstated. We
believe that justice is best served
when the agreed upon mechanism for
resolving such disputes through due
process is allowed to operate.

Philippines article
needs clarification
In the March 12 issue of The Daily,
an article appeared which generally
accurately portrayed a forum spon
sored by the Unity Network on the
crisis in the the Philippines. I would
like to make some corrections,
however.
In my speech, I noted that while
the United States has been pressuring
Ferdinand Marcos for change for the
last year, the "reforms" were aimed
mainly at stabilizing the dictatorship
and stepping up the counter
insurgency war against the New
Peoples Army, not bringing
democracy for the Filipino people.
I was also quoted as saying that the
U.S. government is holding up the
Philippines as a democratic model,
"but the reality is quite different." 1
noted that the new Aquino govern
ment has made some important dem
ocratic reforms, but the Reagan Ad
ministration's version of its promo
tion of democracy is in reality, quite
different.

Finally, in my comments about the
National Democratic Front, I said
that they favored a series of funda
mental changes including land
reform, nationalization of key in
dustries and elimination of the two
U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
In their view, this would necessitate
ending U.S. domination of their
country.
Again, let me say that the reporter
did a generally good job of covering
the forum, especially given the range
and depth of the topics discussed.

Thanks goes to
student volunteers
I want to compliment the student
volunteers who guarded the replica of
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and
helped people find the names of the
dead.
People like you in the 1960s
opposed the war and helped stop the
list of American dead and missing at
58,022. Today, as we again hear the
demands for U.S. military aid in the
name of anti-communism, we would
do well to remember the words of
Clarence Darrow: "History repeats
itself. That's one of the things wrong
with history."

however.
In my speech, I noted that while
the United States has been pressuring
Ferdinand Marcos for change for the
last year, the "reforms" were aimed
mainly at stabilizing the dictatorship
and stepping up the counter
insurgency war against the New
Peoples Army, not bringing
democracy for the Filipino people.
I was also quoted as saying that the
U.S. government is holding up the
Philippines as a democratic model,
"but the reality is quite different." 1
noted that the new Aquino govern
ment has made some important dem
ocratic reforms, but the Reagan Ad
ministration's version of its promo
tion of democracy is in reality, quite
different.

Finally, in my comments about the
National Democratic Front, I said
that they favored a series of funda
mental changes including land
reform, nationalization of key in
dustries and elimination of the two
U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
In their view, this would necessitate
ending U.S. domination of their
country.
Again, let me say that the reporter
did a generally good job of covering
the forum, especially given the range
and depth of the topics discussed.

Thanks goes to
student volunteers
I want to compliment the student
volunteers who guarded the replica of
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and
helped people find the names of the
dead.
People like you in the 1960s
opposed the war and helped stop the
list of American dead and missing at
58,022. Today, as we again hear the
demands for U.S. military aid in the
name of anti-communism, we would
do well to remember the words of
Clarence Darrow: "History repeats
itself. That's one of the things wrong
with history."

Hoover not logical
1 have noted that the defenders of
the Hoover Institution regularly
make use of specious logic as a means
of discrediting and silencing their crit
ics while perversely accusing them of
the self-same behavior. A previous
example was from a Mr. Gann who
asserted that experiencing oppression
gave one no special knowledge of
oppression (he should read "Invisible
Man" and "Black Like Me") and that
such outlooks should not be part of a
"reasoned" debate. Mr. Gann also
sought to bar considerations of
sexism, racism and facism as
meaninglessly pejorative when, in
fact, the terms all refer to those who
would engage in prejudicial exclu
sion.
The most recent example from
John McCarthy (The Daily. Mar. 4
and 6) is particularly abhorrent. He
suggests that the study objected to by
the 16 Stanford professors was a
piece of objective research offensive
only to homosexuals with no taste for
the truth. In fact it was a proposal to
"prove" that AIDS is transmitted by
casual contact, presumably whether it
is true or not and in the face of
available evidence that it is not. The
proposal went on to outline how such
a finding could be used to justify ex
ercises in power that might exceed
even limits imposed by the Constitu
tion. (All yours for only 512.5 million
of the taxpayers' money.) The specter

of Sen. Joe McCarthy, who sought to
enhance his personal power with lies
exacerbating fear, would seem to
more clearly apply to this proposal
than to its detractors.
History has well confirmed that:
"Those who can make you believe
absurdities can make you commit
atrocities." It is important to objec
tively determine who is dishing out
the absurdities.

Coffee House regular
Victor Hill case is
going to arbitrator
In Dwight Ost's letter of Mar. 7, he
contends that Victor Hill, as a United
Stanford Worker member, was fired
unjustly last October for allegedly
slashing Stores Manager Hector Al
len's tires. Ost contends that justice
has been denied for Hill.
The University believes that Hill
was discharged for just cause:
however, the issue of whether or not
it was just is being heard in accor
dance with the grievance and arbitra
tion procedure provided by the USW
contract. Hill's case is currently pend
ing arbitration. The arbitrator, selec
ted jointly by the University and
USW, will make the final decision.
The University will be bound by that
decision.
Ost concludes that there will be no

justice until Hill is reinstated. We
believe that justice is best served
when the agreed upon mechanism for
resolving such disputes through due
process is allowed to operate.

Philippines article
needs clarification
In the March 12 issue of The Daily,
an article appeared which generally
accurately portrayed a forum spon
sored by the Unity Network on the
crisis in the the Philippines. I would
like to make some corrections,
however.
In my speech, I noted that while
the United States has been pressuring
Ferdinand Marcos for change for the
