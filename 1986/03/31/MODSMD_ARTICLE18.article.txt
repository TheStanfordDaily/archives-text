# S. Korea should be next

If you go out today and sit in White Plaza with a peti
tion to modify the electoral college (the odd 18th century
vestige which officially selects our president), you might
get some funny looks, but you won't stir much excitement.
Try the exact same thing at Seoul National University in
South Korea, and you are liable to get arrested, as more
than 250 students discovered last month. The right to
peacefully advocate political change is so basic to us that
we rarely even reflect on it. Why then, one might ask, are
thousands of American troops in South Korea supporting
a regime which flouts our basic political values?
The debate over the lessons America should learn from

the fall of the Ferdinand Marcos regime in the Philippines
has already begun. One of the first places we will have to
apply these lessons is South Korea. Like the Philippines,
South Korea is a capitalist, anti-communist long-time ally
of the United States. Like Marcos, Korean President
Chun Doo Hwan (who took power in a 1980 miltary
coup) has vaguely promised elections at the end of this de
cade. Also like Marcos, however, Chun has set up an elec
toral system that virtually guarantees the victory of him or
his hand-picked successor. Like the Philippines, South
Korea has an active and popular opposition pushing for
democracy, but the Reagan Adminstration has been sup
porting the incumbent regime so as to protect U.S. mili
tary bases there.
The differences between South Korea and the
Philippines, however, may be more instructive than the
similarities. Unlike the Philippines, South Korea has a
boomingly successful economy which has brought
prosperity to most all of the country. South Korea has a
very large, well-educated and influential middle class, in
contrast to the extremes of wealth and poverty which
characterize the Philippines. South Korea has far more

geographic, cultural and religious uniformity than does
the Philippines. For all these reasons, democracy should
be even more successful in South Korea than in the
Philippines. South Korea has, if anything, less excuse than
the Philippines for not instituting democratic reforms. i
Moreover, the nature of the communist threat to South
Korea is very different than was that in the Philippines.
Marcos faced a large indigenous guerrilla movement.
Chun faces no domestic communist threat; rather, he bor
ders aggressively irredentionist North Korea. The North
proved itself a threat in the late 19405, but today its
Stalinist economy could not support a serious attack on
the South. Neither China nor the Soviet Union appear
especially interested in bankrolling North Korean dictator
Kim II Sung's peculiarly repressive experiment in dynastic
communism.
While the communist threat to South Korea is less than
menacing, the American presence is very important to the
government there. The U.S. bases in the Philippines were
strategically vital to the United States, but they were not
an aid in combating the Philippine insurgents. As a result,
Marcos could realistically threaten to close the bases if we
pushed him too hard for reform. In South Korea, by con
trast, the American troops are deployed on the border
with North Korea â€” to serve as a trip wire in the event of
an invasion. The troops do not advance larger U.S. strate
gic goals; they are there only as a favor to South Korea.
Therefore, South Korea (which also runs a huge trade
surplus with the United States) is even more sensitive than
was the Philippines to American pressure for democratic
reform.
South Korea is hosting the 1988 Summer Olympics,
and wants to put on a good show for the world. Its recent
mass arrests of dissidents have started it off on a distinctly
bad foot. Student demonstrators in South Korea have
sought refuge from the police in American installations,
because they believe we represent the values of
democracy. We shouldn't continue to let those students
down. With American pressure on the Chun regime, the
South Korean people can realize their goal of becoming a
truly democratic country. If it worked in the Philippines
and in Haiti, it can surely work in South Korea.
