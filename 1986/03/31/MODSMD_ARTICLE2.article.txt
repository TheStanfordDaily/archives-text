# Former hospital pharmacist contracts cancer, files lawsuit
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
A former Stanford Hospital pharmacist has filed a $20
million lawsuit against 14 pharmaceutical companies
charging that the anti-cancer drugs he handled gave him
leukemia.
Robert Solomon was exposed to several anti-cancer
drugs while employed at the hospital from 1979 to 1983,
according to the lawsuit filed March 11 in Santa Clara
County Superior Court. He later developed non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, a cancer that attacks the lymph system, the
suit said.
Solomon and his wife, Marianne, charged that the anti
cancer drugs were "inherently dangerous, unsafe, defec
tive and hazardous."
The couple claimed that the pharmaceutical companies
were aware of the dangers but gave the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration misleading information about their
products' safety.
Although the companies received warnings about the
potential hazards, they "failed to pass along these warn

ings to the physicians, hospitals, pharmacists or users and
handlers," the suit said.
Solomon and his wife are asking for $20 million to pay
for his treatment and for the income he lost because he
had to resign from work, as well as make amends for his
mental and physical suffering.
Solomon could not be reached for comment yesterday.
His attorney, Mary Alexander, told the San Jose Mercury
News that the drugs entered Solomon's system through
contact with his skin, by inhalation and orally.
The seven drugs named in the lawsuit are included in a
list of potentially hazardous anti-neoplastic agents
released in January by the federal Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.
The companies listed in the suit are: Eli Lilly & Co.,
Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merck & Co. Inc., Roche Labo
ratories, Lederle Laboratories, Hoffman-La Roche Inc.,
the Upjohn Co., American Cyanamid Co., Bristol Labo
ratories, Bristol-Meyers Co., Adria Laboratories Inc.,
Bergen-Brunswick Corp., Drug Services Inc. and Amfac
Supply Co.
