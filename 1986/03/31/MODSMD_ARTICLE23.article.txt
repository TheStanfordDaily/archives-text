## Resident fellows at Stanford: the joys, noise of campus living 
### LISA HERSCHBACH 
Why do they do it? Why do busy, ma
ture Stanford faculty and administrators
abandon their private lives to become res
ident fellows (RFs), living and working 24
hours a day in a "fishbowl" community
whose members are sometimes less than
half their age?
"It is a giving job, not a taking job,"
says Cecilia Burciaga, an associate dean of
Graduate Studies and an RF at # Casa
Zapata. But what is the motivation behind
so much giving ?
Charles Junkerman, an instructor in
humanities and an RF in Madera with his
wife Christy, cites "social, intellectual and
financial compensation."
Socially, resident fellows enjoy the op
portunity to interact with students, outside
the classroom or office. For Christy
Junkerman, the experience "has gotten
rid of the mystery between generations."
Burciaga agrees. "I no longer have so
many preconceived notions about what
18- to 20-year-old students are like," she
says."I used to think they were the 'me'
generation. Now 1 see an enormous
amount of care and compassion, and quiet
action to help others. 1 look to the future
with a great sense of optimism."
Rob Robinson, chairman of the Ger
man Department and an RF in Lagunita
West for ten years, is very enthusiastic
about the job as a social experience.
"I like to talk to students, to go on
beach trips, and to be in dorm plays, for
goodness sake! The job gives me an op
portunity to do things that most faculty

members haven't done since they were
undergraduates," he says.
For Stephen Ferruolo, an RF in Potter
House and assistant professor of history,
the job is "a chance to get out from behind
the podium and show students that their
professors are not unidimensional."
The social benefits of being an RF are
accompanied by intellectual benefits.
According to the job description.
"Resident Fellows are expected to in
itiate. sponsor and support a wide range of
educational activities in the residence."

'It's a giving job.'

Burciaga

By being involved in these activities,
RFs say they learn along with the stu
dents. Ferruolo describes the job as "all
about educating and being educated."
Burciaga says that "I've been stretched in
tellectually as an RF."
Activities range from music series to
programs on AIDS, South Africa or
human sexuality. Says Christy Junkerman,
"It's definitely a job that you can do in
your own style."
In addition, RFs who are faculty mem
bers say they value the opportunity to in
fluence such a broad group of students.
"It's a chance to be involved in the educa
tion of students outside the Medieval His-

Tory Department," Ferruoio says.
Robinson says,"I feel I've had a sub
stantial impact on a huge number of
people, a thing I don't necessarily get from
teaching."
Furthermore, many RFs who are faculty
members feel the experiece has made
them more effective teachers.
"I now have a better sense of the
schedule of students and what are realistic
expectations for them in terms of work,"
says Ferruoio. "1 also have learned more
effective methods of explanation."
The job's rewards are not only social
and intellectual — there are financial
rewards as well.
RFs receive free food and housing from
the University — no small benefits in view
of the astronomical cost of living in the
Bay Area. In addition, the room and
board amounts are not subject to income
or social security tax. According to Res
Ed, the compensation may be worth as
much as $ 10,000 a year.
Although being a resident fellow can be
very rewarding, it is not a job for every
one. "For a non-tenured, young person
coming in, it is not something I would rec
ommend," Burciaga says.
Living in campus housing means that
RFs don't have to spend time commuting,
or even cooking meals. However, the job
itself has added time commitments such as
RA selection, weekly staff and house
meetings, and program planning.
Says Robinson, "You shouldn't do it if
you are committed to many other things."
And he adds, "If you can't deal with
loud noise, forget it."

The social benefits of being an RF are
accompanied by intellectual benefits.
According to the job description.
"Resident Fellows are expected to in
itiate. sponsor and support a wide range of
educational activities in the residence."

'It's a giving job.'
— Cecilia
Burciaga

By being involved in these activities,
RFs say they learn along with the stu
dents. Ferruolo describes the job as "all
about educating and being educated."
Burciaga says that "I've been stretched in
tellectually as an RF."
Activities range from music series to
programs on AIDS, South Africa or
human sexuality. Says Christy Junkerman,
"It's definitely a job that you can do in
your own style."
In addition, RFs who are faculty mem
bers say they value the opportunity to in
fluence such a broad group of students.
"It's a chance to be involved in the educa
tion of students outside the Medieval His-

Tory Department," Ferruoio says.
Robinson says,"I feel I've had a sub
stantial impact on a huge number of
people, a thing I don't necessarily get from
teaching."
Furthermore, many RFs who are faculty
members feel the experiece has made
them more effective teachers.
"I now have a better sense of the
schedule of students and what are realistic
expectations for them in terms of work,"
says Ferruoio. "1 also have learned more
effective methods of explanation."
The job's rewards are not only social
and intellectual — there are financial
rewards as well.
RFs receive free food and housing from
the University — no small benefits in view
of the astronomical cost of living in the
Bay Area. In addition, the room and
board amounts are not subject to income
or social security tax. According to Res
Ed, the compensation may be worth as
much as $ 10,000 a year.
Although being a resident fellow can be
very rewarding, it is not a job for every
one. "For a non-tenured, young person
coming in, it is not something I would rec
ommend," Burciaga says.
Living in campus housing means that
RFs don't have to spend time commuting,
or even cooking meals. However, the job
itself has added time commitments such as
RA selection, weekly staff and house
meetings, and program planning.
Says Robinson, "You shouldn't do it if
you are committed to many other things."
And he adds, "If you can't deal with
loud noise, forget it."
