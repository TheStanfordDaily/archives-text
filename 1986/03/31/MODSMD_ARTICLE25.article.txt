## 'Horns, Gators top Cardinal at NCAA swim 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Despite the efforts of Stanford's Jenna
Johnson, the meet's outstanding swimmer,
the depth of Texas proved to be the telling
factor as it won its third straight NCAA
Women's Swimming and Diving Champion
ship, March 20-22 at the University of
Arkansas.
The Cardinal finished third with 538 points,
matching its third-place finish of a year ago.
The Longhorns had 633 points to edge
second-place Florida, which came in at 586.
This year, however, was a different third
place finish. Last season Stanford was over
300 points away from Texas. This year, the
difference was smaller.

"This year was a more prestigious third
place," senior Diana Zock said. "Everyone
swam really well."
"We swam as good as we could possibly
swim," Stanford Coach George Haines said.
Alter the first day, Stanford's champion
ship hopes looked promising as Cardinal
swimmers set two U.S. and NCAA records en
route to a 27-point first-day lead.
Johnson was the first-day star.
She set a U.S. and NCAA record in the
100-yard butterfly (52.69), defeating Olym
pic gold medalist Mary T. Meagher. Meagher
was the only swimmer to beat Johnson during
the season. She also teamed with Jennifer
Pokluda, Kathy Smith and Diana Zock in the
U.S. and NCAA record-setting 200 medley

relay team (1:40.22). In addition, Johnson
won the 50 freestyle.
"She did her job," Haines quipped.
Also swimming well on the first day was
junior Susan Rapp, who won the 200 individ
ual medley (2:01.80). Stanford swimmers
Smith and Monica Nielebeck finished third
and sixth respectively in the race.
The second day began the Cardinal's
demise.
From four victories on day one, Stanford
could manage only two wins in the next two
days. Despite some fast Stanford times, the
depth of Texas began to take its toll.
"When we got behind on the second day it
kind of dashed our hopes," senior Lisa Hazen
said.

The lone Cardinal victory on day two was in
the 200 freestyle relay. Comprised of
Johnson, Zock, freshman Aimee Ber/ins and
Smith, the team swam the second fastest time
in NCAA history, 1:31.27.
There were several near misses for the
Cardinal on the second day.
Johnson finished second in the 200
freestyle to California's Conny Van Bentum.
In the 100 breaststroke, after setting a school
record in the preliminaries, Smith slowed
down in the finals and had to settle for third
place. Rapp came in fourth in the 400 individ
ual medley. In addition, the 400 medley relay
team finished second in a school-record
3:42.61.
After day two, Stanford (416 points) had

slipped to second place behind Texas with
462.
On the final day of competition, Texas
widened its lead and Florida, aided by its
divers, overtook the Cardinal for second
place.
Two Cardinal swimmers culminated an ex
cellent NCAA meet on Saturday.
Johnson capped a stellar performance by
winning the 100 freestyle in 49.03. She ac
counted for 77 points during the meet and
was voted the meet's outstanding swimmer.
Rapp. in only her third race in the 200
breaststroke since her knee operation in
1985, came back strong to finish second in a
season-best 2:14.1 1.
"She is one unbelievable lady,"
Haines said of Rapp.
In addition, Stanford came in
second in the 400 medley relay with
sophomore Stacy Shupe finishing
fourth in the 1,650 freestyle.
In the end, the depth of Texas
proved to be too much for the rest of
the field.
"Texas had incredible depth,"
Hazen said. "Whereas we put in two
or three swimmers, they could put in
five or six swimmers in each event."
