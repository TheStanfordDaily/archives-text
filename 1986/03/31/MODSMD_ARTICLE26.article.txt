GENEVA, Switz. (AP) — Stanford freshman Debi
rhomas had been waiting a long time for her champion
ship night to end.
loday (March 21) has lasted for four weeks." an ex
hausted hut elated I homas said after dethroning East
German Katarina Witt as the women's world figure
skating champion. "I'm so happy it's over."
Witt won the long program, the finale of the women's
competition at the World Figure Skating Championships.
But U.S. Champion Thomas, who hails from San Jose,
was tar enough ahead after last Wednesday's short pro
gram that her second-place showing in the long program
clinched the title.
She became the first black skater ever to win a world
championship.
I homas, who was pacing back and forth down the cor
ridor before her performance, conceded that Witt's super
ior skating to the score from "West Side Story" had made
her nervous.
"It was kind of hard to skate after Katarina, and when 1
heard her marks, I thought, 'Well, you're going to go out
and have fun now," " Thomas said. "Hut I learned tough

ness from it."
"She's very tough when she's under pressure," agreed
Alex McGowan. Thomas' coach.
Thomas skated an elegant, athletic program to Duke
Ellington and ballet music. It wasn't as glittery as Witt's,
which earned a pair of perfect scores, but it was good
enough.
After her performance was finished, Thomas was
beaming on the ice, and McGowan on the sidelines was
punching his fists in the air in victory.
"1 don't believe it," Thomas said as she left the ice. "I
even landed the double axel."
Witt finished second overall, while American Tiffany
Chin wound up third.
Thomas finished with an overall factored placement
total of 3.6. followed by Witt at 4.4 and Chin at 7.2.
Before Thomas and Brian Boitano of Sunnyvale, who
won the men's title the previous night, the last American
skaters to win at the world championships were four-time
champion Scott Hamilton in 1984 and Rosalyn Sumners
in 1983. The U.S. won both singles titles in '83, with Sum
ners and Hamilton.
