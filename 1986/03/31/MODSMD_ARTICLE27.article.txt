# Netters beat No. 1 Trinity
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
A frenzied crowd of 2.000 showed
up at the Trinity tennis courts last
Thursday to watch the No. 1 Tigers'
women's team battle No. 2 Stanford,
fully expecting a victory for the home
team.
What the partisan crowd saw,
however, was a rare Trinity loss —
only its second defeat at home in
seven years.
Trailing 2-0 after the first two
matches, the Cardinal swept the four
remaining singles matches and
captured two of the three doubles
matches to upset the Tigers 6-3.
The following evening in Austin,
Stanford beat up an already battered
Texas team by an 8-1 score.
The two wins in Texas, combined
with a 9-0 shutout of Harvard March
24 on the Stanford courts, raised the
Cardinal's season record to 10-0 and
put the team in position to be ranked
No. 1. "At this point in time, we
definitely have to be No. 1," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
The Trinity crowd was. as Brennan
noted, "hooting and hollering" early
in Thursday's match as the Tigers
broke on top in the first four singles
matches.
Cardinal junior Patty Fendick
dropped the first set of the No. I
singles match 6-3 to Trinity All -
American Gretchen Rush. At the
same time, juniors Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Stephanie Savides had
dropped their first sets and freshman

Stephanie Savides' 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win over Jane Holdren tied
Stanford's match with Trinity and propelled the Cardinal to a 6-3 win.
"That perked everybody up," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said.
Marianne Werdel was involved in a
first-set tiebreaker in the No. 2
singles.
"We looked pretty bad there for a
while," Brennan said.
The situation became even more
bleak for the Cardinal as Rush took
the second set to sweep Fendick 6-3,
6-1. Trinity's Elvyn Varrable held off
Eldredge 6-2, 6-4 to give the Tigere a
2-0 lead.
As the home crowd celebrated,
though, Werdel and Savides pulled
Stanford even in the match. Werdel
won the tiebreaker and an equally
tough second set to edge the Tigers'
Ann Holbert 7-6, 7-5.
"She's really showing her stuff
now," Brennan said of the highly
touted freshman who struggled ear
lier in the season. "She's a completely
different player. She's really moving
well."
Savides rebounded from her first
set loss to knock off Trinity's Jane
Holdren 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. Her comeback
gave the Cardinal a motivational lift,

according to Brennan. "That perked
everybody up," he said.
Sophomores Kay Tittle and Cari
Hagey breezed in the final two singles
matches to put Stanford ahead to
stay. Tittle beat Jana Kletac 6-1, 6-4
while Hagey, playing in place of
injured freshman Eleni Rossides,
captured the No. 6 singles against
Kilmeny Waterman 6-2, 6-1.
Even though his team was up 4-2
going into the doubles action, Bren
nan was holding his breath. "We
weren't really the favorites in any of
the doubles," he said.
The Cardinal looked to be on the
ropes once again as Trinity played
strongly early in the doubles matches.
Fendick and Eldredge split the first
two sets with Holbert and Rush, but
the teams of Hagey-Savides and
Tittle-Werdel each trailed after one
set.
Fendick and Eldredge quieted the
boisterous crowd for good, putting an
end to the Trinity comeback by win
ning the third set and the match 6-3,
3-6, 6-4. "Rush and Holbert are a
real top team," Brennan said. "As it
turned out, we just played too good
for them."
In the No. 2 doubles, Hagey and

Savides survived two match points in
the second set to defeat Varrable and
Kletac 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
Tittle and Werdel were defeated
for the first time this season in the
No. 3 doubles match, losing to
Trinity's team of Holdren and Mary
Graber 7-5, 6-4.
Brennan was obviously delighted
to beat the nation's No. 1 team — the
same team that knocked off the top
seeded Cardinal last season at the
NCAA tournament.
"Now we've played them in the
lion's den and we've survived," Bren
nan said. "We're pretty tough, not
easily intimidated."
The following evening, the sky
high Cardinal demolished injury
plagued Texas 8-1 in the Longhorns'
new tennis stadium.
Even had Texas been at full
strength, though, the result of the
match would not have been different,
Brennan said. "We would have
beaten them even if they would have
had their players."
Stanford swept the singles matches
and might well have swept the
doubles except that Brennan decided
to play reserves Alyce Werdel and

Sonia Kazazian after the match had
been clinched. Werdel and Kazazian
lost the No. 2 doubles to Texas'
Robin Field and Eileen Tell 7-5, 6-0.
Stanford's 10-0 record brings back
memories of 1984, when the Cardinal
went undefeated and captured the
national championship. Brennan in
dicated that this year's players are
very confident.
"The girls are starting to realize
that we don't lose very often," he
said, noting that the Cardinal is 62-2
over the past three seasons. "They're
feeling pretty invincible."
