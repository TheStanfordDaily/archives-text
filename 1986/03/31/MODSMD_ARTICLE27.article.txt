### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
A frenzied crowd of 2.000 showed
up at the Trinity tennis courts last
Thursday to watch the No. 1 Tigers'
women's team battle No. 2 Stanford,
fully expecting a victory for the home
team.
What the partisan crowd saw,
however, was a rare Trinity loss â€”
only its second defeat at home in
seven years.
Trailing 2-0 after the first two
matches, the Cardinal swept the four
remaining singles matches and
captured two of the three doubles
matches to upset the Tigers 6-3.
The following evening in Austin,
Stanford beat up an already battered
Texas team by an 8-1 score.
The two wins in Texas, combined
with a 9-0 shutout of Harvard March
24 on the Stanford courts, raised the
Cardinal's season record to 10-0 and
put the team in position to be ranked
No. 1. "At this point in time, we
definitely have to be No. 1," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
The Trinity crowd was. as Brennan
noted, "hooting and hollering" early
in Thursday's match as the Tigers
broke on top in the first four singles
matches.
Cardinal junior Patty Fendick
dropped the first set of the No. I
singles match 6-3 to Trinity All -
American Gretchen Rush. At the
same time, juniors Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Stephanie Savides had
dropped their first sets and freshman

Stephanie Savides' 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 comeback win over Jane Holdren tied
Stanford's match with Trinity and propelled the Cardinal to a 6-3 win.
"That perked everybody up," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said.
