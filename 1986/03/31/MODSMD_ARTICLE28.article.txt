## Stanford's Davis may be Houston-bound 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
The future of the Cardinal basketball program was
in doubt last night as Stanford Coach Tom Davis was
still deciding whether to accept the head coaching posi
tion at the University of Houston.
Both Davis and Athletic Director Andy Geiger are
in Dallas for tonight's championship game between
Duke and Louisville. Neither could be reached for
comment. Davis' decision is expected early this week,
perhaps as early as today.
Davis is the fourth man to be offered the Houston
job after Guy Lewis, the only coach the Cougars have
had, retired at the end of this season. The previ
ous three were Paul Evans, who left Navy last Wednes
day to sign on at Pittsburgh; Pat Foster of Lamar; and
ex-lowa coach George Raveling, who eventually took
the job vacated by Stan Morrison at USC.
By the middle of last week, Davis' departure seemed
imminent. After Raveling reportedly turned down the
job on Tuesday, the only remaining candidates were
Davis and former Cougar star Elvin Hayes, who has no
head coaching experience.
Davis said Tuesday that he planned to fly to Dallas
to attend a coaches meeting before Saturday's Final
Four games. He went instead to Houston on Wednes
day to meet with Houston officials. Later that day,
Houston athletic director Tom Ford said he expected a
new coach to be named "in the next couple days."

According to Don Sanders, a member of Houston's
four-man selection committee and of the Houston
Board of Regents, Davis is the man Houston wants.
'"He represents every thing we're looking for as a
coach." Sanders told the San Francisco Chronicle.
" Tom is an awfully classy, visible type of person who
can get the job done."
The only question remaining is whether Davis wants
Houston. He first interviewed with Ford three weeks
ago and has expressed interest in the Cougars' pro
gram. He has. however, hesitated since being offered
the position.
One possible concern is Houston's problems with
the NCAA. The football program is currently being in
vestigated, and there are fears that basketball may be
scrutinized as well.
It has also been rumored that Sports Illustrated mag
azine is preparing an investigative piece listing viola
tions that could put the program on probation for as
long as two years.
Another rumor making the rounds in Dallas is that
Davis may be interested in the now-vacant lowa job.
Davis is from Big 10 Conference country (Wisconsin),
and the Hawkeyes have a solid nucleus of young
players. lowa also lacks Houston's problems with the
NCAA.
Geiger insisted last week that Davis was still Stan
ford's coach and that no new contract offer would be
made to entice him to stay. "That's not the way things
are done here," he said.
