# Rejection of Munk could be a key factor

### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
If Tom Davis eventually leaves
Stanford and accepts the head
coaching job he has been offered at
the University of Houston, rest
assured that one of his major
reasons for doing so will be the
March 21 decision of the Admis
sions Office to deny Chris Munk
admission into the freshmen class
of 1990.
Although last year's recruiting
class, including Howard Wright and
All-Pacific 10 Conference selection
Todd Lichti, was by any measure an
outstanding one, Munk was the
player expected to complete the
turnaround of the Stanford basket
ball program begun when Davis
was hired four years ago.
Munk, a 6-foot-9 power forward
from Riordan High School in San
Francisco, was the only player from
Northern California on the four

All-America teams selected by
Parade Magazine. He was consid
ered by some the eighth leading
high school prospect this year, even
though he missed most of his senior
season with a knee injury.
The Stanford coaching staff
began working with Munk in his
sophomore year. He toughened his
curriculum and raised his grade
point average to its current 2.8. He
also took the Scholastic Aptitude
Test four times.
"Somewhere along the line
someone led Chris to believe that if
he got his test scores and his grades
up, which he did, that he would
have a pretty good chance of being
accepted," Riordan Coach Ron
Isola said. "It's unfortunate they
built his hopes up. (But) I don't
think anyone tried to be devious."
Munk was approached by some
of the nation's 11 nest coaches, such
as Georgetown's John Thompson
and Dean Smith of North Carolina,

hut he chose to wait for Stanford's
decision.
"It wasn't any fun waiting, but
I'm glad I didn't back out early.
Stanford was my first choice, and I
thought I could get in," Munk told
the Peninsula Times-Tribune. "I
think I was a good role model, be
cause I took it as a personal chal
lenge to get my grades up."
A press release from Davis read:
"1 am very disappointed. I feel the
decision is Stanford's loss. Chris
Munk is a terrific young man whose
desire — both academic and ath
letic — is outstanding. I'm sure he
will be a resounding success at
whatever school he decides to at
tend. "
Munk has not decided yet. but
because he has expressed a prefer
ence to stay in California, USC is
the.frontrunner. Other possibilities
are Georgetown and Villanova,
with California and USf-' as
loncshots.
