# Candidates prepare for ASSU elections
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Candidates for next year's Council of Presidents
(COP), senior class presidents, Student Conduct
Legislative Council and ASSU Senate will be
gearing up their campaigns in preparation for the
annual ASSU elections, to be held April 15 and 16.
The elections will determine next year's student
government, special fees and other issues.
Two slates have declared their candidacy for the
COP, which works as a creative force in the senate
with veto but no voting power. The "Josh"' slate,
which is this year's Chaparral entry, is comprised of
Chris Adamson, Josh Weinstein. Jim Suhre and
Alex Danel. Running against "Josh" is the 'Real
Solution," which features Kim Crawford, Rudy
Fuentes, Mary Thurber and Carey White.
Three slates will compete for the senior class

presidents, who assist with Commencement plan
ning and senior class activities. The "Slate of
Shock" includes Monica Lytle, Mary Obana, B.G.
Porter and Novian Whitsitt. The second slate,
"Slate Out of Nowhere," is composed of Valerie
Crites, Mike Lin, Tom Wheeler and Lily Chang.
"Slaterhouse Four" includes Ricardo Gressel, Hil
lary Kircher, Scott Schaeffer and Birch Thomas.
According to Elections Commissioner Robin
Miller, the Student Conduct Legislative Council
serves as a judicial council that keeps students in
formed as to the ramifications of the new Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard rulings. Running
for the Legislative Council are juniors Larry Bloch,
Sharon Merrow and Vein Shure, sophomore Ken
neth Fenyo and freshman Erik Lillquist.
Among the issues students will vote on is the new
constitution, which is a revised version of the con
stitution defeated in last quarter's special elections.

The new constitution provides for 30 voting
senators, 15 graduates and 15 undergraduates,
which is 10 less than the 40 senators in the present
constitution. While the current constitution pro
vides that graduate studenlvvote only for candi
dates running in their individual schools, the pro
posed constitution will have graduate students vote
at-large for any graduate student running for sen
ate.
Senate Chair Carey White, who co-authored the
new constitution with COP member Michael Col
lins, said the revised constitution "does answer the
criticisms levelled against the last one," which was
defeated after minority interest groups cited
measures they said were detrimental to minorities.
White said the revised constitution will "make it
easier for student groups to get on the ballot" for
special fee requests, and will "make the legislative branch
more effective."
The other major changes in the new constitution in
clude the creation of an administrative manager, replace
ment of provisions for "Rights of the Accused" in the
judicial branch by the Legislative and Judicial Charter,
lowering the petition requirements for special fee requests
and changing amendment procedures.
Three constitutional amendments also on the elections
ballot will be incorporated into the new constitution if it is
passed. Amendments four and five will modify the process
for amending the constitution and change the process of
initiative, referendum and recall. Amendment six will give

the student body the power to set the amount of each as
sociation fee for the next year. In the present constitution,
the senate sets the association fee, according to the
amount of special fees approved during the spring elec
tions.
While amendment six will actively give to students the
power to set the association fee, an advisory referendum
concerning the same issue will also be voted on in the up
coming elections. In this referendum voters will indicate
their opinions concerning the amount of next year's asso
ciation fee and whether student fees should be given to re
ligious organizations.
Another referendum, sponsored by senior Robby
Perkins, will allow students to indicate whether they
believe the University should "make an immediate com
mitment to totally divest within a specified time frame
from all companies doing business in South Africa under
apartheid laws."
