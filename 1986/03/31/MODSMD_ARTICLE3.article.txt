### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Candidates for next year's Council of Presidents
(COP), senior class presidents, Student Conduct
Legislative Council and ASSU Senate will be
gearing up their campaigns in preparation for the
annual ASSU elections, to be held April 15 and 16.
The elections will determine next year's student
government, special fees and other issues.
Two slates have declared their candidacy for the
COP, which works as a creative force in the senate
with veto but no voting power. The "Josh"' slate,
which is this year's Chaparral entry, is comprised of
Chris Adamson, Josh Weinstein. Jim Suhre and
Alex Danel. Running against "Josh" is the 'Real
Solution," which features Kim Crawford, Rudy
Fuentes, Mary Thurber and Carey White.
Three slates will compete for the senior class

presidents, who assist with Commencement plan

Shock" includes Monica Lytle, Mary Obana, B.G.

The new constitution provides for 30 voting
senators, 15 graduates and 15 undergraduates,
which is 10 less than the 40 senators in the present
constitution. While the current constitution pro
vides that graduate studenlvvote only for candi
dates running in their individual schools, the pro

at-large for any graduate student running for sen
ate.
Senate Chair Carey White, who co-authored the
new constitution with COP member Michael Col
lins, said the revised constitution "does answer the
criticisms levelled against the last one," which was
defeated after minority interest groups cited
measures they said were detrimental to minorities.
White said the revised constitution will "make it
easier for student groups to get on the ballot" for
