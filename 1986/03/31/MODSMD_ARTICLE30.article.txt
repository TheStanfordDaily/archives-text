# Stanford routs ASU 12-0 to take series, 1st place
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
TEMPE. Ariz. — Somebody's got to tell the
Stanford baseball team that fireworks shows are
only spectacular under the stars. You know,"The
rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air." That
kind of stuff.
Hey. fireworks just aren't the same in the light of
day. Or are they?
Stanford had its chances to put on a night-time
extravaganza. But in night games here with
Arizona State Thursday and Eriday, the fizzling
Cardinal didn't explode much of anything. The
teams split the two games.
It wasn't until Saturday afternoon, under a
bright, blue Arizona sky, that Stanford set off its
show of shows. And it was clear that the time of day
didn't matter much. A blowout is a blowout.
The Cardinal erupted for 18 hits — including
three doubles and a grand — to rout ASU 12-
0 in the rubber game of the three-game weekend
set.
Coupled with Thursday s 7-1 opening-game win
and Friday's 8-2 loss, the Cardinal's overall record
moved to 21-9. The Sun Devils fell to 25-15. Stan
ford. which left for Tempe atop the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division, remains in first place in
the Six-Pac with a mark of 7-3. one game ahead of
UCLA. 6-4. ASU is three games back at 5-7.
On Saturday. Stanford's outfield of Walt Harris.
Mark Davis and Toi Cook supplied most of the
punch. The trio accounted for 10 hits, seven runs
and eight RBI.
"They are our experienced guys, Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said of his prized outtield.
comprised of a junior and two seniors. "Those guys
are the keys for us; they make things happen.'

All iiucc contributed base hits in Stanford's
three-run first inning. Harris opened the game with
a ground single to center off starter and loser David
Cassidy, 3-4. One out later John Ramos, who was
6-for-14 during the series, singled to center. Harris
raced to third, and Ramos moved to second when
center fielder Rick Morris' throw missed the cutoff
man.
Davis singled home both Harris and Ramos with
a bouncer up the middle. Davis, after advancing to
second on a groundout, scored on first bast man
Doug Robbins' single.
"I think that how the outfield goes is how we go
(as a team). - ' Cook, the junior right fielder, said.
"We did our job today. ... It's just up to us to
produce."
The right-handed hitting Cook, who entered Sat
urday's game with a .267 hatting average and no
home runs, delivered the big blow in the top of the
fifth. With two Stanford runs already in and the
bases loaded. Cook slashed a fastball from Tony
Harris, Cassidy's reliever, to the opposite field.
"When 1 hit it." Cook said, "I thought it wits
going to be a sacrifice fly. Then, when I saw him
(light fielder Steve Mariucci) go back, I thought it
would drop in for maybe a triple."
As it turned out. Cook's blast hit the railing on
the top of the fence and bounced over for a bases
clearing home run. It was his third in three years on
the Farm.
Cook's grand slam made the score 9-0 Stanford,
a more than ample cushion for the Cardinal's start
ing pitcher, Lee Plemel. The sophomore righty
pitched all nine innings to record his second win in
three decisions, striking out six. walking two and
scattering only three hits along the way.
"Every thing was working today." Plemel said. "I
was trying to stay with the curveball. If I'm throu -
ing the curveball forstikes. then I'll be successful."

Plemel. in only his second start for Stanford this
year, joined Jack McDowell and Kevin Kunkel as
the only Cardinal pitchers to hurl complete games.
"I was going to go as long as I could." Plemel said.
"I felt strong at the end. ... I think the heat
helped, it kept me loose."
Plemel allowed back-to-back singles with one
out in the third inning, but escaped by getting Brian
Beals to ground out to second and erasing Tim Es
may on a comebacker.
A pair of walks in th« ASU third put runners on
first and second with two outs, but Plemel retired
Mariucci on a weak popup to the mound to end the
threat.
"This wasn't an ASU hitting team of the past,"
Plemel said. "They're just not as solid up and down
the lineup like they have been."
McDowell made ASU hitters look silly in
Thursday's 7-1 Stanford win and afterward echoed
Plemel's sentiments: "They're (ASU) definitely
not the hitting team they were last year."
In going the distance for the sixth time this year,
the sophomore right-hander (8-1) struck out 12.
equalling his career best, walked four and limited
the Sun Devils to only five hits. It was his fourth
consecutive complete-game win.
But what did McDowell, who is quickly estab
lishing himself as the Six-Pac's premier pitcher,
think of his performance? "I was sort of out of it
tonight." he said. "I was more wild than I was in my
last couple of outings.'
But Jim Brock. ASU's 13-year coach, was im
pressed: "He (McDowell) had sort of a mismatch
last night. . . the intimidation factor with a guy like
that is just overwhelming."

With his dazzling three-hit shutout of Arizona State on Sunday, Lee

Thorpe (3-3) and Jeff Sutter, aggres
sive Cardinal baserunning and an
abundance of Sun Devil miscues
added up to seven runs.
Stanford scored in the top of the
first — without the help of a base hit.
Two walks, a double steal and two
ASU errors produced two runs. Two
more tallies in the second padded
McDowell's advantage.
On the evening, Stanford swiped
six bases in eight attempts and
benefited from three wild pitches,
two passed balls and two ASU errors.
Friday night's middle game, won by
ASU 8-2, demonstrated why Stan
ford is a team that has to jump out to
an early lead in order to be successful.
Five runs in the first inning off
Stanford starter and loser Steve
Chitren, 2-3, put the Cardinal in a
hole it couldn't escape from.
"1 don't think they're (Stanford)
going to make their living catching up
seven or eight runs. . . . They just
don't have the pop in their bats for

that," Brock said. "When they're be
hind like that they have to come out
of their game.''
Marquess agreed: "When we get
behind, we can't be as daring as we'd
like to be; we can't do things we nor
mally do, put pressure on the other
team."
Stanford, trailing throughout, did
not even attempt to steal a base. And
with ASU starter Kurt Dempster, a
sophomore righty, baffling Stanford's
hitters, this one was decided early.

The right-handed hitting Cook, who entered Sat
urday's game with a .267 hatting average and no
home runs, delivered the big blow in the top of the
fifth. With two Stanford runs already in and the
bases loaded. Cook slashed a fastball from Tony
Harris, Cassidy's reliever, to the opposite field.
"When 1 hit it." Cook said, "I thought it wits
going to be a sacrifice fly. Then, when I saw him
(light fielder Steve Mariucci) go back, I thought it
would drop in for maybe a triple."
As it turned out. Cook's blast hit the railing on
the top of the fence and bounced over for a bases
clearing home run. It was his third in three years on
the Farm.
Cook's grand slam made the score 9-0 Stanford,

scattering only three hits along the way.
"Every thing was working today." Plemel said. "I
was trying to stay with the curveball. If I'm throu -

Plemel. in only his second start for Stanford this
year, joined Jack McDowell and Kevin Kunkel as
the only Cardinal pitchers to hurl complete games.
"I was going to go as long as I could." Plemel said.
"I felt strong at the end. ... I think the heat
helped, it kept me loose."
Plemel allowed back-to-back singles with one
out in the third inning, but escaped by getting Brian
Beals to ground out to second and erasing Tim Es
may on a comebacker.
A pair of walks in th« ASU third put runners on
first and second with two outs, but Plemel retired
Mariucci on a weak popup to the mound to end the
threat.
"This wasn't an ASU hitting team of the past,"
Plemel said. "They're just not as solid up and down
the lineup like they have been."
McDowell made ASU hitters look silly in
Thursday's 7-1 Stanford win and afterward echoed
Plemel's sentiments: "They're (ASU) definitely
not the hitting team they were last year."

TEMPE. Ariz. — Somebody's got to tell the
Stanford baseball team that fireworks shows are
only spectacular under the stars. You know,"The
rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air." That
kind of stuff.
Hey. fireworks just aren't the same in the light of
day. Or are they?
Stanford had its chances to put on a night-time
extravaganza. But in night games here with
Arizona State Thursday and Eriday, the fizzling
Cardinal didn't explode much of anything. The
teams split the two games.
It wasn't until Saturday afternoon, under a
bright, blue Arizona sky, that Stanford set off its
show of shows. And it was clear that the time of day
didn't matter much. A blowout is a blowout.
The Cardinal erupted for 18 hits — including
three doubles and a grand — to rout ASU 12-
0 in the rubber game of the three-game weekend
set.
Coupled with Thursday s 7-1 opening-game win
and Friday's 8-2 loss, the Cardinal's overall record
moved to 21-9. The Sun Devils fell to 25-15. Stan
ford. which left for Tempe atop the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division, remains in first place in
the Six-Pac with a mark of 7-3. one game ahead of
UCLA. 6-4. ASU is three games back at 5-7.
On Saturday. Stanford's outfield of Walt Harris.

are the keys for us; they make things happen.'

All iiucc contributed base hits in Stanford's
three-run first inning. Harris opened the game with
a ground single to center off starter and loser David
Cassidy, 3-4. One out later John Ramos, who was
6-for-14 during the series, singled to center. Harris
raced to third, and Ramos moved to second when
center fielder Rick Morris' throw missed the cutoff
man.
Davis singled home both Harris and Ramos with
a bouncer up the middle. Davis, after advancing to
second on a groundout, scored on first bast man
