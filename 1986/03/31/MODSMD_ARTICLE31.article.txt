## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Two weekends ago, just before last quarter's
final exams, the Stanford men's swim team
finalized its fifth straight Pacific 10 Conference title
by swimming some outstanding races in East Los
Angeles to qualify a total of 14 swimmers and two
divers for the NCAA Championships.
"I was really pleased," Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney said. "We're swimming right on schedule."
T he Cardinal finished with 598 points, more than
50 points ahead of its closest competitor, UCLA.
Ihe star of the meet was senior John Moffet,
who won the 200-yard breastroke for the fourth
year in a row. With a time of 1:59.92, Moffet
became only the second swimmer in Pac-10 history
to win four straight titles. He also posted his best
time of the year in the 100 breast-stroke, 54.67,
\«'hirh 112 arned him a second-place ranking.

"He (Moffet) has really made this program what
it is today," Kenney said.
Sophomore Sean Murphy also raced well, win
ning both the 100 and 200 backstrokes. He re
corded his fastest times of the season in both events
— 49.82 and 1:46.41, respectively — and he set a
new conference record in the 200 backstroke.
Teammate Pablo Morales placed first in the 100
butterfly and posted a season's best time of 47.48.
Anthony Mosse also left the meet pleased. The
sophomore from New Zealand placed second in the
200 butterfly and swam his quickest race of the
season in 1:45.49. But, unshaven and not rested,
Mosse was beaten by USC's Dave Cadematori.
The Cardinal relays performed well,
"considering that some swimmers were un
shavened," Asst. Coach Ted Knapp said. The 400
medley relay won in 3:14.41.
With this meet representing the final chance to

qualify swimmers for the NCAAs April 3-5, Ken
ney hoped to qualify a few additional men. But he
said, 'We've got everyone we need."
Sophomore Matt Nance's disqualification in the
200 individual medley was "unfortunate," Knapp
said, hut Nance will still swim the 400 IM at the
NCAAs this year. Senior Sam McAdam, however,
just missed qualifying times in his events.
Weighing the Pac-10 meet against the NCAAs,
"It's like the Olympic trials compared to the Olym
pics," Knapp said.
Of last year's nine NCAA participants from the
Stanford team, all nine will return this year. The
live new swimmers who qualified for the national
championships are all freshmen. The Cardinal
picked up some depth in the distance races. Fresh
men Bob Gavin and Robert Gene both qualified
for the 1,650 freestyle at the Pac-10 meet.
"We should have the most quality-oriented team
at the NCAAs this year," Knapp said.
