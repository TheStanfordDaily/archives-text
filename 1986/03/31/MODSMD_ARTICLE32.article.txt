### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis team
went up into the heights of Arizona
this past weekend and came back
down with two Pacific 10 Conference
wins in its pocket.
The Cardinal players adjusted well
to the high altitude conditions to
defeat the Arizona State Sun Devils
6-3 on Friday and the Arizona
Wildcats 6-2 on Saturday.
The two victories for the sixth
ranked Cardinal moved the team's
record to 8-1 overall and 2-0 in Pac
-10 play. For a while on Friday,

however, the Stanford squad was
holding its breath.
With Stanford ahead by a 3-2
score, the course of the entire match
was hinging on the outcome of Card
inal senior Jim Grabb's match against
ASU's Mike Holten.
Holten won the first set 7-5, but
Grabb, who was playing only his
second singles match of the season,
rebounded to take the next two sets
6-3, 6-1 and Stanford cruised on to
victory.
The Stanford quartet of Dan
Goldie, Grabb, Patrick McEnroe and
Eric Rosenfeld propelled the team to
victory all weekend by winning all

their respective singles matches in
both Tempe and Tuscon.
Goldie, who is the No. 2 player in
the nation according to the latest
rankings, slid through both of his
matches in straight sets, defeating
ASU's Andy Roediger 6-1, 6-1 and
Arizona's lan Aler 6-2, 6-1.
Undefeated is still the word to
describe McEnroe, as the sophomore
raised his singles record to a perfect
9-0 on the season by beating Grant
Adams of ASU 6-2, 6-3 on Friday
and John Schmitt of Arizona 6-4. 6-4
on Saturday.
Rosenfeld finished the sweep of the
top four singles spots by defeating

ASU's Ken Kuperstein 6-3, 7-6 and
squeezing past Arizona's Benji Pap
pell 6-7, 6-4, 7-6.
In Friday's action against Arizona
State, a couple of Sun Devil Jeffs
took the fifth and sixth singles
matches. Jeff Wood defeated Stan
ford's John Letts 7-5, 6-2, and Jeff
Karp defeated Cardinal junior Scott
Moody 6-3, 6-1.
Stanford clinched the match in
doubles play, as the teams of Goldie-
Grabb and McEnroe-Letts both won.
The Cardinal had an easier time at
Arizona, as the team swept all six
