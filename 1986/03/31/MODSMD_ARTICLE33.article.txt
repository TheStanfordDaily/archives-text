# Stanford goes 3 of 5 during break

In addition to last weekend's
three-game set in Tempe, Ariz.,
the Stanford baseball team saw
plenty of action during the spring
recess.
Fresno State hosted the Card
inal March 12 in the first of what
schedule makers envisioned as a
two-game series. The Bulldogs
took the first game 5-3, handing
Lee Plemel his first loss of the
year. Mike Goff, 1-1, was the win
ner. Rain cancelled the second
game.
In Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division play, USC and Stan
ford tangled in a weekend series at
Sunken Diamond March 22-24.
Hits and runs were hard to come
by throughout the series â€” the
teams combined to score only 15
runs in the three games.
In Saturday's opener, won by
Stanford 4-0, Jack McDowell
hurled a complete-game shutout
to post his seventh victory of the
year. The sophomore surrendered
six hits, did not walk a batter and
struck out 12. At one point in the
middle innings, McDowell struck
out six of seven batters.
Right-fielder Toi Cook lined a
two-run single to center in the first
to give McDowell all the support
he needed.

On Sunday, it was Brad Brink's
turn to shine as USC evened the
series with a 6-0 win. The sopho
more left-hander hurled a four-hit
shutout, walking three and striking
out eight along the way.
Cook's aggressive baserunning
in Stanford's eighth inning lifted
the Cardinal to a 3-2 win in the se
ries' finale. Cook, on second with
two out and the score knotted at
two, decided on his own to run
with the pitch to Walt Harris.
With Cook running from second
on the play, Harris hit a slow roller
to the shortstop hole. After back
handing the ball, the shortstop
elected to throw to first, hoping to
heat the speedy Harris.
Meanwhile, Cook did not hes
titate; he rounded third and
headed for home. Harris beat the
shortstop's throw to first, and
Cook scored the go-ahead run
before USC realized what had
happened.
Al Osuna, who had come on in
the sixth to replace starter Lee
Plemel, closed the door on the
Trojans in the ninth to notch his
fifth win against one loss.
A day later, in a game with
Hayward State at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford rallied for three
late runs to pull out a 10-9 win.
Rob Wassenaar, who pitched four
shoutout innings in relief, earned
the win, his third in four decisions.
