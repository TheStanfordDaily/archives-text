# Crew hopeful after Redwood Shores
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Although they were by no means in
mid-season form, the Stanford men's
and women's crew teams showed at
Redwood Shores last weekend that
there may be more positive things
going on in the water than just swim
ming for the Cardinal.
Facing teams from Long Beach
State and Oregon State that had more
competition under their belts, Stan
ford was able to squeeze out its share
of victories in both the men's and
women's races.
The wins for the Cardinal men
came in the first and second novice-8
races and in the frosh-4. The varsity
-8 fell to the 49ers by 3.9 seconds,
while the varsity-8 lost a 2.8-second
decision to Long Beach as well. The
frosh-8 was nipped by a mere 1.5
seconds by OSU. Stanford's only
third-place finish came in the junior
varsity-8.
"In the heat of competition, we
didn't row the kind of race we had
practiced to row, had planned to row

and must row," Stanford Coach Ken
Dreyfuss said.
Still, Dreyfuss is upbeat about the
team's future. "We are very excited
about all of our boats this year, but on
this day we didn't perform up to our
ability in any race except novice-8,"
he said. "But this kind of tough racing
has left us even more eager for next
week's (San Diego) Crew Classic."
Like the men, the women will be
racing in San Diego this weekend,
and also like the men, they have a
coach optimistic about his team's
prospects. "Our varsity has a lot of
potential; so does JV," Coach John
Davis said. "We expect a lot from
them."
The highlight of the Redwood
Shores races for the women was a 12-
second win by the varsity-8. Another
encouraging sign was that the JV
finished only seven seconds behind
the Long Beach varsity. "We were
pretty pleased they were able to hang
in there against varsity crews."
OSU won two of the three frosh-8
races, with Stanford taking the other.
The Cardinal beat the Beavers in the
frosh-4 as well.
