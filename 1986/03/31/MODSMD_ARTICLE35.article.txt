## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
When spring football opens on
April 8, there will be two new
coaches roaming the Stanford
practice field, Steve Axman and
Jack Gilmete.
Of the assistants added to
Coach Jack Elway's staff on
March 21, one will be a stranger to
Stanford but not to coaching,
while the other will be new to
coaching but familiar on the Farm.
The stranger to Stanford is Ax
man, who joins the Cardinal with
extensive coaching experience.
Axman's most recent job was as
offensive line coach with the Den
ver Gold of the United States
Football League. He will have the
same position under Elway.
From 1980 through 1984, Ax
man was offensive coordinator

ana quarterback coach at Arizona.
He has also coached at Illinois and
at Army under offensive wizard
Homer Smith, now the offensive
coordinator at UCLA.
"I'm very excited about coming
to Stanford," Axman said. "I've
always held Stanford football in
high regard, and it will be an
honor to be part of such a great
program."
The other new coach, Gilmete,
has no coaching experience, basi
cally because his playing career
ended only last fall. A starting
inside linebacker for the Cardinal
last season, Gilmete was second
on the team in total tackles with
135 and led the team in unassisted
tackles with 40.
"I'm very pleased because I
didn't think I'd ever be given an
opportunity like this so quickly,"
Gilmete said.
