# Trouble for Card fencers at NCAAs
## 
### LISA MARTINEZ Staff writer 
During spring break, the NCAA
qualifiers from the Stanford men's
and women's fencing teams headed to
Princeton to participate in what
looked like their NCAA National
Championships.
It was in the bag. The teams, each
ranked seventh nationally, were com
ing off fantastic seasons. The men had
come on strong with a record of 15-1,
while the women had posted a 14-0
mark for the season.
On March 18-19, the men — El
liott Cheu, Andy Goorno, Dave
Finklestein, Steve Levitan and Larry
Murk — came up against strong fen
cers from Wayne State, Columbia,
Pennsylvania and Jllnois. "They
choked," Stanford Coach Buzz Hurst
said. "All of the men were eliminated
in the early rounds except Andy
Goorno. He fenced well enough to
get past them, but he had bad pick
when the double-eliminations came
around."
The women's team walked into its
NCAAs on March 20, facing Notre
Dame, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Penn

sylvania, Temple University, Fair
leigh Dickenson and Pennsylvania
State. With All-American Jennifer
Yu leading the pack, the team
seemed to be assured of a win.
Suiprisingly, the women ended up
sixth. "It wasn't a bad finish, but 1
was a little more surprised at individ
uals," Hurst said.
At the Western Regionals, Jennifer
Yu, Holly Taylor and Alison Reid
claimed the top three women's spots
on the roster. At Nationals, Yu came
in 10th, Taylor was 21st and Reid
took the 23rd spot. "They just
seemed to short circuit," Hurst said.
"1 suspect that there are a number
of reasons," he said. "But, I think
that both the men's and women's
teams went in trying too hard. They
were bearing quite a psychological
burden."
During finals week, Stanford Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger an
nounced that funding for five campus
teams — men's and women's fencing,
softball, field hockey and wrestling,
would be completely cut. To survive,
these teams will have to produce all
of their own funds, including coaches'
salaries and travel.
