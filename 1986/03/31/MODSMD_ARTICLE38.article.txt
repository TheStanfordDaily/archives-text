# Purpur, Dukes impress at Stanford Invitational
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
As any gambler will tell you,
there's no such thing as a sure bet.
But as any Stanford track fan will also
tell you, Patty Purpur and Pam Dukes
are as close to a sure bet as you ll
find.
At Saturday's Stanford Invita
tional, the freshman-senior duo of
Purpur and Dukes rose to the occa
sion, placing fifth and third in what
was probably the strongest women's
shot put field ever assembled in Stan
ford Stadium.
Dukes earned herself a place in the
record books with a throw of 55-1 Vz,
the ninth best collegiate throw ever,
and Purpur took another big step
toward the record books with a throw
of 50-9 1/4, a personal best by over a
foot.

Competing unattached, Peggy Pol
lock, a former De Anza College ath
lete, won the event with a throw of
57-3'/2. Her toss erased a stadium
record which had stood for 24 years.
Second place went to a Carol Cady,
who also won the discus with a 1986
U.S. best of 201-6.
Cady is a former Stanford All -
American, and in a way her presence
was quite fitting, because Purpur had
just recently become the Cardinal's
latest as well as it's only Ail-
American at the National Indoor
Championships on March 15. Being
only a freshman, she went to the meet
"not knowing what to expect," and
came back with seventh place and
All-American honors.
In the men's meet, Jeff Atkinson,
Christian Skoog, Brian Connoly and
Steve Schadler set a new stadium
record in the 880-yard relay with an

impressive time of 7:25.2. The race
was, as Atkinson said, "'not real
close," but that only made the time
look even tougher, for it's hard to run
fast when there's no competition.
After setting the record on Friday,
the four distance aces came back to
win the distance medley on Saturday,
but with the fatigue of the previous
day's effort weighing on their legs, it
was nothing more than a "survival
race,"' Atkinson said.
Brian Marshall tied for second
place in the men's high jump with a
leap of 6-10, ahd Lisa Bernhagen did
the same in the women's, reaching a
height of 6-0. Ceci Hopp placed
fourth in the women's 1,500-meter
run with a time of 4:31.8, Karen
Nickerson placed fourth in the discus
with a toss of 177-3, and John Gash
won the pole vault by clearing a
height of 16-*
