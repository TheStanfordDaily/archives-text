### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
While everyone else was studying hard Thursday
and Friday evenings of Dead Week, the Stanford
men s volleyball team was winning two straight home
matches against the ninth and lOth-ranked teams in
the country.
After defeating Long Beach State in three games
and San Diego State in five, Stanford has a 10-5 over
all record and an 8-5 mark in the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association, good for fifth spot in
the league.
Stanford had little difficulty downing Long Beach
State 15-1, 15-5, 15-2 in a match that lasted barely an
hour. The 49ers had defeated the Cardinal in five
games earlier in the season at Long Beach, but the
team that came into Maples Pavilion Thursday night
looked like an entirely different squad, hitting only
. 132 as a team.
The Cardinal also made a turn-around from the ear
lier Long Beach match. In that contest, Stanford made
a number of hitting errors and offensive and defensive
mistakes cost the team a win. At home, however, only
two Cardinal players had hitting errors — and a total of
just three altogether. The squad had a hitting

percentage of .350.
All-American Jon Root lead the team with 13 kills
against the 49ers. The senior outside hitter also
compiled a .524 average. Stephen Blue and Chris
Braun both picked up 10 kills tor Stanford and weie
first and second in hitting percentage, as Blue hit .625
and Braun .588.
"Long Beach is a much better team. Root
said."That was not the Long Beach we know. That's
the worst I've ever seen them play in my tour year
career."
Stanford had a much tougher time the following
night against San Diego State. The first time the two
teams met, the Cardinal came away with a quick thiee
game victory. On Friday however, the Aztecs took the
squad to five before Stanford scraped out a 12-15, 15-
6, 8-15, 15-12, 15-7 win.
Neither team played particularly well. Stanford hit
.208 as a team and San Diego State hit. 184. The Card
inal made 36 hitting errors, the Aztecs had 33.
Root again led Stanford in kills with 23. Sophmore
Scott Fortune followed with 15. Seniors Brett Monello
and Dan Parr both came in and performed well, as Parr
totalled eight kills and a .263 average while team cap
tain Monello topped the Cardinal with a .316 average
to go along with seven kills.
