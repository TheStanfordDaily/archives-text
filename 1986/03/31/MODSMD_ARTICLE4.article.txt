# Recent chemical spills prompt county probe
## 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A recent increase in the number of chemical-related
emergencies in Stanford laboratories has prompted the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office to investi
gate possible violations of health and safety laws by the
University.
At a meeting with officials from Stanford and the Dis
trict Attorney's Office here Tuesday, Palo Alto Fire Chief
Robert Wall said a minor explosion in the Stauffer II
Physical Chemistry Building March 20 resulted from a
violation of laws regulating the storage of hazardous
chemicals in refrigerators.
Stanford officials indicated at the meeting that there are
similar refrigerators containing hazardous materials in
other campus laboratories, and Deputy District Attorney
Jerry Nadler said his office would continue to investigate
possible violations, according to the Times Tribune.
Alain Decleve, University director of Health and
Safety, said Stanford is taking steps to facilitate the
process of reporting and cleaning up laboratory chemical
spills.
Wall and Decleve agreed that the main interest of the
District Attorney's Office is to see that all proper steps are
taken to comply with county ordinances.
The Palo Alto Fire Department periodically inspects
Stanford laboratories to monitor compliance with safety
regulations, but only county and state agencies have au
thority to enforce them. Wall said.
Wall said after the rrleeting that he was "very encour
aged" by the University's invention of the "life safety
box," a metal container that indicates on the outside what
hazards are present in a laboratory — fire, biological,
radiological or other. The boxes contain lists of specific
hazardous materials and names of people familiar with the
laboratory to contact in an emergency.
The University has about 1,500 laboratories, and life
safety boxes have already been installed at many medical
center and chemical laboratories, according to Decleve.
He and Wall agreed that boxes should be placed in other
potentially hazardous areas on a priority basis.
Decleve said he has also assigned University Health and
Safety Office staff members to work with the Palo Alto
Fire Department to take an inventory of above-ground
storage facilities and to help tire inspectors monitor com
pliance.

The University "is moving toward full compliance"
with safety laws in its underground facilities hut there is
still a great deal of work to he done in the above-ground
areas. Wall said.
Under Decleve, the Health and Safety Office has or
ganized its own emergency response team.
"There are good plans. It's a matter of time to get them
completed," Wall said. "The University faces the same
difficulties as everybody else. . . . The University prepara
tion and resources for emergency response are really
good. While there are some questions of detail, the basic
framework is there."
The Deputy District Attorney's Office could not be
reached yesterday for comment.
Despite these measures, Wall said he expects the num
ber of reports of chemical-related emergencies to remain
high because of increasing public awareness. "The num
ber of reportable incidents has risen not because of poor
management, but because of greater participation" by
concerned citizens, he said.
Calls reporting chemical emergencies have risen 200
percent in the past year, according to Wall.
Decleve added that the number of reports may continue
to increase in the near future after implementation of new
federal and state hazard communication laws designed to
increase the awareness of laboratory workers of the pres
ence of hazardous materials. Under existing laws,
employees have the right to know only about potential ex
posure.
The number of chemical-related calls may increase
"until the culture changes through better education and
training" so that individuals can make informed decisions
whether a spill is serious enough to call emergency
specialists, Decleve said.
Tuesday's meeting was called in response to a series of
recent incidents in which firefighters and hazardous ma
terials response teams were called to campus. None of the
emergencies resulted in major damage or personal injury.
The March 20 incident occurred when a chemical ex
ploded in a chemistry refrigerator and blew the door
open. Wall said the refrigerator was not designed to hold
flammable liquids and had failed to continue cooling for
24 hours prior to the explosion.
One person who was aware that the refrigerator was not
functioning failed to report the fact to those responsible
for the laboratory, Wall said.
The chemical involved in the ex
plosion could not be identified be
cause the label on the jar was
destroyed, but all unknown chemicals
were treated as though they were
highly hazardous, acccording to stan
dard procedure, Wall said. The
chemical was bagged with absorbents
.and taken to a burial site in Southern
California.
Wall called the meeting "very use
ful" and said "there was a positive ex
change of information. Both the
University and the fire department
are working well together."

Wall and Decleve agreed that the main interest of the
District Attorney's Office is to see that all proper steps are
taken to comply with county ordinances.
The Palo Alto Fire Department periodically inspects
Stanford laboratories to monitor compliance with safety
regulations, but only county and state agencies have au
thority to enforce them. Wall said.
Wall said after the rrleeting that he was "very encour
aged" by the University's invention of the "life safety
box," a metal container that indicates on the outside what
hazards are present in a laboratory — fire, biological,
radiological or other. The boxes contain lists of specific
hazardous materials and names of people familiar with the
laboratory to contact in an emergency.
The University has about 1,500 laboratories, and life
safety boxes have already been installed at many medical
center and chemical laboratories, according to Decleve.
He and Wall agreed that boxes should be placed in other
potentially hazardous areas on a priority basis.
Decleve said he has also assigned University Health and
Safety Office staff members to work with the Palo Alto
Fire Department to take an inventory of above-ground
storage facilities and to help tire inspectors monitor com
pliance.

The University "is moving toward full compliance"
with safety laws in its underground facilities hut there is
still a great deal of work to he done in the above-ground
areas. Wall said.
Under Decleve, the Health and Safety Office has or
ganized its own emergency response team.
"There are good plans. It's a matter of time to get them
completed," Wall said. "The University faces the same
difficulties as everybody else. . . . The University prepara
tion and resources for emergency response are really
good. While there are some questions of detail, the basic
framework is there."
The Deputy District Attorney's Office could not be
reached yesterday for comment.
Despite these measures, Wall said he expects the num
ber of reports of chemical-related emergencies to remain
high because of increasing public awareness. "The num
ber of reportable incidents has risen not because of poor
management, but because of greater participation" by
concerned citizens, he said.
Calls reporting chemical emergencies have risen 200
percent in the past year, according to Wall.
Decleve added that the number of reports may continue
to increase in the near future after implementation of new
federal and state hazard communication laws designed to
increase the awareness of laboratory workers of the pres
ence of hazardous materials. Under existing laws,
employees have the right to know only about potential ex
posure.
The number of chemical-related calls may increase
"until the culture changes through better education and
training" so that individuals can make informed decisions
whether a spill is serious enough to call emergency
specialists, Decleve said.
Tuesday's meeting was called in response to a series of
recent incidents in which firefighters and hazardous ma
terials response teams were called to campus. None of the
emergencies resulted in major damage or personal injury.
The March 20 incident occurred when a chemical ex
ploded in a chemistry refrigerator and blew the door
open. Wall said the refrigerator was not designed to hold
flammable liquids and had failed to continue cooling for
24 hours prior to the explosion.
One person who was aware that the refrigerator was not
functioning failed to report the fact to those responsible
for the laboratory, Wall said.
The chemical involved in the ex
plosion could not be identified be
cause the label on the jar was
destroyed, but all unknown chemicals
were treated as though they were
highly hazardous, acccording to stan
dard procedure, Wall said. The
chemical was bagged with absorbents
.and taken to a burial site in Southern
California.
Wall called the meeting "very use
ful" and said "there was a positive ex
change of information. Both the
University and the fire department
are working well together."
