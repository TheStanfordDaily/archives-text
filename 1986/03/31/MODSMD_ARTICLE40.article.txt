Soviet military spending assessed
WASHINGTON — The government's two chief intelligence agencies
have told Congress that Soviet defense spending between 1974 and
1985 grew only half as fast — 2 percent a year instead of 4 percent — as
in the preceding decade.
And weapons procurement, they said in a report released yesterday,
rose only 1 percent annually — roughly the Soviet inflation rate —
during most or all of the same period.
But the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence
Agency, in their annual report to the Joint Economic Committee, in
sisted that the Soviet Union made significant gains during the decade
both in its strategic forces, such as nuclear missiles, and in its conven
tional capabilities, including tanks and guns.
"If true, it was a neat trick," Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) said in a
statement accompanying release of the CIA-DIA report. "The Soviets'
most closely guarded secret may now be how to strengthen defense in
the midst of a virtual procurement freeze."
Proxmire's barb was aimed at the Pentagon, which has requested huge
budget increases to increase U.S. military capability. In contrast to the 1
percent annual growth rate of Soviet defense procurement, U.S. military
procurement has risen by 13 percent a year from 1981 to 1985, accord
ing to a stafT member of the subcommittee on security economics, which
Proxmire chairs.
A CI A spokesman had no comment on Proxmire's skepticism. A DIA
spokesman suggested that the small annual rise was sufficient to explain
the growth in Soviet military capabilities.
Nonetheless, the Soviet defense figures should provide new ammuni
tion for congressional critics of the Pentagon's request that its 1987
budget grow by 8 percent on top of expected inflation. The budget re
quest has come under fierce attack by members of Congress who want to
cut the huge federal deficit and who are dismayed at waste and fraud by
defense contractors.
11 die as factions clash in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A new outbreak of heavy fighting boosted the
death toll to 11 here yesterday as Palestinians clashed with Shia Moslem
militiamen around the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila in
West Beirut, security sources reported.
The renewed fighting came after the collapse of a tentative cease-fire
arranged for yesterday morning by a coordination committee that
brought together the warring Shia Amal movement and the Palestinian
National Salvation Front, which opposed Yasser Arafat's leadership of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The number of wounded during the weekend fighting reached 33 as
the rival factions continued to clash using machine guns, rockets and
mortars.
The battle erupted Friday night and continued all day Saturday. An
Amal statement said, "The clashes started when a group of Palestinians
attacked an Amal post on the outskirts of the camp, killing one of the
guards." However, the Palestinians said Amal started the fighting.
Meanwhile, Beirut radio said an Amal military leader, Ali Shaito, died
when a shell fired from the camps landed on an Amal position near the
Sabra camp. It added that the two other casualties yesterday were
civilians.
Radio reports added that unidentified gunmen killed a Palestinian of
ficial in the Ain el Hilwecamp northeast of Sidon yesterday morning.
They added that all roads to the camp were then blocked off by bur
ning that had been set afire by Palestinians in the camp. Security sources
said the situation in the area was very tense.
Iran rockets tankers in Gulf
MANAMA, Bahrain — Two tankers, one Norwegian and one
Panamanian, were rocketed by Iranian helicopters in the central Gulf
but neither was believed to have sustained casualties or serious damage,
shipping sources said yesterday.
The attacks, northeast of Qatar, were bplieved in retaliation for an
Iraqi missile attack that set the 372,201-ton Liberian-registered tanker
Hawaii ablaze early Saturday south of Kharg Island, Iran's main oil ex
port terminal.
The 284,919-ton Norwegian vessel Berge King was attacked by
IraAian helicopters Saturday night. One rocket fell in the water while the
other lodged in the air-conditioning compartment without exploding.
The ship, on its way to the Saudi Port of Ras Tanura to pick up a ship
ment of oil, radioed for assistance to defuse the projectile.
About midday yesterday rocket-firing Iranian helicopters raided the
96,747-ton Stalios, a Panamanian-registered vessel that also was on its
way to Ras Tanura to pick up oil. No serious damage was reported.
The huge Hawaii was described as the mother ship of Iran's tanker
shuttle service in the Persian Gulf. Previously held at Sirri Island as a
floating reservoir, it was pressed into service after the Iraqis damaged six
shuttle tankers during the past few weeks.
Shultz opposes public arms talks
SHANNON, Ireland — Arms-control talks with the Soviet Union
"are never going to get anywhere" until they return to the private
diplomacy that led up to the Geneva summit last November, Secretary
of State George Shultz said yesterday.
Heading for home after a 10-day swing through Western Europe,
Shultz told reporters traveling with him en route to a refueling stop here
that the Soviets were to blame for the current trend of arms-control in
itiatives through press releases.
Shultz made the point one day after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
called publicly for President Reagan to meet him in Europe to negotiate
a nuclear-test ban.
"If we're going to see a return to the kind of progress we were making
in the period before the Geneva meeting" last November. Shultz said,
"we're going to have to be settling into some conversations that are
direct between the Soviets and ourselves."
"There's a pattern now that they started" by announcing recent test
ban proposals publicly before making them privately, Shultz said. "We
are never going to get anywhere doing things that way."
As for the U.§. side's public diplomacy. Shultz recalled that when he
gave Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov a letter from Reagan two weeks
ago at the funeral of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, "the content
of the letter nad already been briefed (to the press) and responded to in
Tass," the Soviet news service.
The letter, responding to the Soviet proposal to join a unilateral
nuclear-testing moratorium, invited Gorbachev to send witnesses to an
underground nuclear test in the United States. The State Department
briefed reporters on it the day before Shultz. met Ryzhkov.
Reagan rejected Gorbachev's renewed call for a halt in testing Satur
day and repeated an invitation for Gorbachev to set a date to visit the
United States.
Pope asks mankind to end violence
V ATIC AN CITY — Pope John Paul II made an impassioned plea for
mankind to renounce violence in an Easter message to a crowd of some
250,000 at St. Peter's Square here yesterday.
The pope called on the human race to oppose the many violent forms
of death in the modern world. During his speech he made particular ref
erence to those regions "plagued by guerrilla wars and conflicts" where
the rights and freedoms of the individual were "trampled upon."
The pontiff said the greatest challenge of the age was the challenge of
peace, and added, "to choose peace means to choose life."
Afterwards he greeted the world in 49 languages, two more than last
year, including Hebrew. Albanian and Russian. Among those listening
was Secretary of State George Shultz, whose visit to Rome ended yester
day.
