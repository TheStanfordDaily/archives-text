DURBAN, South Africa â€” Black
community leaders from across South
Africa decided yesterday to drop
school boycotts as a tactic in their
campaign against apartheid and to
adopt a broader strategy of mass ac
tion, using black consumer boycotts,
rent strikes and possibly a general
strike.
Although the decision appeared to
be a step back from confrontation
with South Africa's white govern
ment, spokesmen for the National
Education Crisis Committee des
cribed it as "an important escalation
of the struggle against apartheid" by
involving the whole black commu
nity, not just young people.
Nevertheless, the decision, reached
in an all-night conference here by
1,500 parent, teacher and student
delegates, should mean less violence.
Many of the clashes over the past 18
months have occurred between secur
ity forces and students who were out

of school, boycotting classes.
Several members of President
Pieter Botha's government had
worked with leaders of the National
Education Crisis Committee over the
past three months to meet as many
blacks demands as possible, and
Botha's lifting of a state of emergency
three weeks ago was due in part to
the committee's pressure.
But conference leaders denied that
they had relented in their demands
for sweeping political, economic and
social changes extending far beyond
the government's proposed reforms.
As an initial sty)w of black political
strength, the conference called for a
three-day general strike starting June
16. That date is the 10th anniversary
of student protests in Soweto, Johan
nesburg's black satellite city, that led
to nationwide anti-government riots
in which 575 people died.
The conference also urged
community-wide support for the

protests planned by black labor un
ions on May I and for increased use
of rent strikes and consumer boycotts
to bring action on local and regional
issues.
The conference repeated oppostion
demands for the release of jailed
black nationalist leader Nelson Man
dela and other political prisoners, for
the return of exiles and for legaliza
tion of the African National
Congress, the principal black
nationalist organization.
In other resolutions, the confer
ence called for further international
isolation of South Africa, including
withdrawal of foreign investment
from the country and the cancellation
of South African Airways' landing
rights around the world.
The conference attacked the
Reagan Administration "as an ac
complice" of apartheid and called on
Americans "not to support the mur
derous policies of the Reagan Admin

istration, particularly their attempts
to destabilize the legitimate and
popular government in Angola."
Conference speakers rejected the
government's arugment that blacks
would suffer most from foreign
divestiture of South African assets.
The prolonged education crisis, a
unifying issue in the often divided
black community, was the focus of
the closed conference, which was also
attended by representatives of na
tional black organizations and labor
unions. But its real significance lay in
the adoption, by what amounted to a
national congress of the elected rep
resentatives of most of South Africa's
25 million blacks, of an overall strat
egy and program to confront apart
heid.
Committee officials expressed con
fidence that black youths would heed
the conference's call to return to
classes when the new school term
begins Wednesday.
