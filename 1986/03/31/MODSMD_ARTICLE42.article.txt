# Demonstration in S. Korea

### 
KW ANGJ U, South Korea — The movement for
democratic elections in South Korea gathered
steam yesterday as thousands of people demanding
an end to U.S. support for President Chun Doo
Hwan staged the first anti-government demonstra
tion here since troops crushed a 10-day rebellion in
this city six years ago.
The demonstrators, shouting "Down with Dic
tatorship! Down with Chun Doo Hwan! Down with
America!" blocked traffic along Kwangju's main
street for several hours, until they were dispersed
by shield-toting riot police with tear-gas launchers
at the ready.
The three-hour demonstration followed an
open-air rally at which about 60,000 people lis
tened to speeches by opposition politicians, calling
for an immediate revision of the South Korean con
stitution to allow for direct presidential elections.
The rally, part of a campaign to gather 10 million
signatures in support of demands for constitutional
change, was the largest anti-government demon
stration since Chun, a former general, seized power
in a 1980 coup.
Rally participants were seen affixing their
thumbprints in red ink to rectangular pieces of

paper on which they had written their names and
addresses.
Chun's government, which originally declared
the drive to collect signatures illegal and threatened
to jail all who signed, changed its policy last month
and asked instead that discussion of constitutional
revision be put off until after 1988 to ensure the
success of the summer Olympic Games, which
Seoul will host that year.
Opposition leaders, however, have accused Chun
of using the Olympics and the Asian games, to be
held in South Korea later this year, for political
purposes.
"Are the Olympics more important than
democracy? Is there any event that can be more
important than democracy?" opposition leader
Kim Dae Jung said in a tape-recorded message
broadcast at the rally.
Kim, who received 46 percent of the popular
vote in the last direct presidential elections in
Korea 15 years ago and who hails from the
Kwangju area, was prevented by police from ad
dressing the crowd in person.
Police stopped Kim's car in Seoul as it headed

yesterday morning for the airport and forced him to
return to his home. Kim had also been prevented
from going to a similar rally that attracted 20,000
people last Sunday in Pusan.
Kim accused Chun of being insincere in a prom
ise to consider constitutional revision after 1988
because Chun, who has said he will step down after
a single term in office that same year, "will no
longer be in a position to change the constitution."
Chun has promised to give Koreans the first
peaceful transfer of power in their modern history
by resigning in 1988 and not running for re
election that year.
Chun's opponents, however, argue that without a
constitutional change that permits direct elections,
the 1988 vote will not be democratic.
Opposition leaders complain that the present
system, under which presidential candidates do not
campaign but wait for the verdict of an electoral
college of more than 5,000 members, does not give
opposition candidates a fair chance.
For their part, government spokesmen argue that
the U.S. president is also chosen by an electoral
college.
