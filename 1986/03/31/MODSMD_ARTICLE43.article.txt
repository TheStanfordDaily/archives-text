Ortega rips U.S. claims
WASHINGTON — The president of
Nicaragua said yesterday that the Reagan Ad
ministration blew last week's fighting on the
Honduran-Nicaraguan border "out of propor
tion," and that Washington's complaints were
timed to the Senate vote on $100 million in aid
for the anti-Sandinista rebels.
Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista leader, held out
no hope in a televised interview that an element
in the Senate-passed measure intended to en
courage the rebels and the Nicaraguan govern
ment to negotiate would be fruitful.
The Reagan Administration has asserted that
as many as 1,500 Sandinista troops, making up
two battalions, crossed the Nicaraguan border
into Honduras, clashing with the rebel forces,
known as contras, whose camps are tucked away
in relatively inaccessible areas along the border.
Others have estimated that 800 Nicaraguan
troops took part in the fighting, and that such in
cursions have been made repeatedly in recent
years.
U.S. forces based in Honduras were called
upon last week to use Huey and Chinook
helicopters to fly Honduran troops, weapons and
supplies into the region after the confrontations
began and President Reagan provided $20 mil

lion in weapons, ammunition, and other military
aid for Honduras.
Appearing on the CBS News program "Face
the Nation," Oretega said in Managua, the
Nicaraguan capital, that such clashes have taken
place "for years now all along the frontier area
.. . .They are totally defensive operations."
James Cagney dies
James Cagney, whose feisty, finger-jabbing
portrayals of the big city tough guy helped create
a new breed of Hollywood superstar and made
him one of the most imitated actors in film his
tory, died Easter Sunday at his farm in Stan
fordville, N.Y. He was 86.
The actor, who had been ailing for year's with
diabetes and heart trouble, had gone to his
secluded farm in upstate New York to rest fol
lowing his release earlier this month from Lenox
Hill Hospital in New York City.
Cagney's electrifying screen personality,
coupled with a Depression-riddled America
ready to cheer the kind of anti-heroes he played
— men rebelling against a world they did not
create — catapulted the pugnacious, fast-talking
Irishman into a legendary stature that far
surpassed his 30 years of movie-making.

Shuttle plan considered
WASHINGTON — The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration is considering a plan to
replace the Challenger shuttle with a new orbiter
that would be financed and owned by private in
dustry and leased to NASA, according to agency
officials.
The idea was advanced recently by General
Space Corp., a Pittsburgh-based firm whose vice
chairman is James Fletcher. President Reagan's
choice to be the new NASA administrator.
The firm, a subsidiary of Astrotech Interna
tional Corp., has offered to raise the $1.5 billion
to $2 billion needed for a Challenger replace
ment privately.
Despite skepticism on Capitol Hill, the Gen
eral Space proposal is being taken seriously by
some NASA officials, agency sources said.
After meeting with General Space Chairman
Willard Rockwell Jr., former chairman of shuttle
manufacturer Rockwell International Corp., act
ing NASA administrator William Graham di
rected an agency task force to draft a request for
a proposal that could be presented next month to
General Space and other companies interested in
financing an orbiter.
