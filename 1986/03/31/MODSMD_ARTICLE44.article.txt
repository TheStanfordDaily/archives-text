The spring party's over
PALM SPRINGS — Restless students contin
ued to mill around parks and streets yesterday as
many prepared to return to school after a week of
sometimes debauched and violent spring reveliy.
Traffic moved slowly through the city, and
police reported crowds of students still active
yesterday but subdued compared to Friday's
rampage by beer-guzzling youths who threw
rocks and bottles and tore the clothes off women.
"It appears today that everyone is recuperat
ing, laying around the parks and hotel pools,"
police Sgt. David Goodwin said.
He predicted most of the estimated 10,000
high school and college students will leave town
as their hotel check-out times expire.
The town was quiet last night, although some
students "were still trying their best to be jerks,"'
said a police spokeswoman who declined to be
identified.
"The big problem now is getting out of town."
she said. Calls were coming in from youths
worried about encountering massive traffic jams
as the Easter break crowd hit the road.
Pledges jam HBO line
LOS ANGELES — Some of the world s fun
niest people got serious with a weekend appeal
for the homeless, and Americans responded by
jamming a 500-line telephone bank with pledges.

a "Comic Relief' spokesman said yesterday.
But sponsors of Saturday night's benefit
telecast will not announce how much money was
raised until today, said Brian Lindquist. a spokes
man for the Home Box Office cable television
network in Los Angeles.

The show, hosted by comedians Billy Crystal,
Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams, starred
about 40comics and was broadcast by HBO.
Although Crystal announced at one point
during the show that donations were pouring in
at the rate of $ 10,000 a minute, Lindquist said it
would be misleading to conclude that $2.4 mil
lion was raised during the four-hour telecast.
"HBO is being very careful," Lindquist said.
"This is the first time we've done anything like
this and we want to make sure that all our figures
are audited before we make any announce
ments."
HBO agreed to allow local cable companies to
carry HBO's signal on a free channel, increasing
the show's potential audience from 14.5 million
homes to 39 million.
The show offered humor for a broad spectrum
of tastes, ranging from the down-home style of
Minnie Pearl, with a pricetag in her hat, to Pee
Wee Herman's bizarre gags. Among the other
comic luminaries were Steve Allen, Jerry Lewis,
Madeline Kahn, John Candy, David Steinberg,
Buddy Hackett. Joe Piscopo, Gilda Radner, Carl
Reiner, Sid Caesar and Henny Youngman.
Today's weather
Morning low clouds and fog along the coast
and locally inland. Mostly sunny in the afternoon.
Highs in the 60s to mid-70s.
