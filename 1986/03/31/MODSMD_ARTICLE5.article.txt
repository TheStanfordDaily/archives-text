# 150 laid off from hospital
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
The 150 layoffs announced at the
Stanford Hospital before spring
break are not expected to have any
impact on the institution's ability to
provide health care, according to
hospital spokespersons.
"Patient care areas have been least
affected" by the layoffs, according to
Spyros Andreopoulos, vice president
for Medical Affairs at the Stanford
Medical Center. He added that
managers who decided what positions
to eliminate planned it that way.
According to Shirley Kraus, vice
president for Medical Affairs, the
layoffs were not made across-the
board but through an examination of
the staffing needs of each hospital
service. Cuts were also made by attri
tion — leaving vacant positions un
filled. Kraus did not name the job
categories the layoffs will affect.
The total of layoffs announced by
the hospital is significantly less than
the 200 to 400 workers rumored to
be part of layoff plans when officials

announced plans to make staff cuts in
January.
Hospital officials said at the time
that declining revenue required a re
duction in expenses, according to an
article in the San Jose Mercury News.
Not enough patients are staying in the
hospital for long'periods of time, and
federal reimbursements are shrink
ing, Sheldon King, president and
chief executive officer of the hospital,
told the Mercury News.
In the past four years, the average
patient stay at Stanford Hospital fell
from 6.8 to 6.3 days. Patient days
dropped from 156,654. excluding
newborns, to 140,552, well in
keeping with national trends.
The layoffs are the first major re
duction in personnel at the hospital
since before the creation of Medicare
and Medicaid 20 years ago.
The hospital has set up a job search
center for the employees who will
lose their jobs. The center has been
giving resume-writing assistance to
the employees, as well as offering job
listings and skills analysis. Andre
opoulos said the job search center ap

pears to be working well so far. He
said employees have been "filling out
forms" and "looking out" for
available Bay Area openings since
the center was set up.
"Even though one regrets that the
layoffs had to happen, we anticipate
that the former employees will be
able to find other jobs in the Penin
sula," Andreopoulos said.
In a letter to all employees dated
March 14, King and William Arnold,
vice president and chief operating of
ficer, said, "Some 400 full-time
equivalents (FTEs) have been
eliminated from the 1986-87 budget.
That does not mean that we will lay
off 400 people. For several months,
we have been reducing the number of
FTEs by attrition — by not filling
vacant positions. We have also placed
careful controls on the creation of
new positions."
The letter went on to say, "Our
managers have come up with a vari
ety of creative ways to manage costs
and eliminate expenses. As a result,
the effect on our staff has been less
than we had originally anticipated."
