# Fellowships cure summertime blues

Are you sick and tired of
looking for a summer job? Have
you even thought about a summer

Feature

job? Are you fed up with thinking
about the fact that you haven't
even thought about a summer job?
If your answer is yes to one or
more of the above questions, the

Public Service Center just might
be the answer to your prayers.
Through the Public Service Sum
mer Fellowship Program, students
can now create their own job for
the summer rather than depend on
unreliable employers.
Entering its third year, the pro
gram encourages Stanford stu
dents to identify a community
need at a local, national or inter-
national level and develop an innovative, practi
cal project to address that problem. Students
are asked to design a project (with the assis
tance of a community contact person) that
would not otherwise take place.
Two years ago, Stanford student Liz Butler,
now a senior, created her own job with the help
of the program. A native of Orange County,
Butler worked closely with a Santa Ana com
munity organization called STOP-GAP, which
develops therapy programs for hospitals, com
munity centers and retirement homes.
Butler's project included not only participa
tion in the development and execution of these
therapy sessions, but also the development of a
community outreach program that was designed
to raise money and increase publicity for STOP
GAP.
Butler said she considers fundraising her most
important contribution to the organization.
She recalled that the group was suffering
from grave financial hardship before she joined
the team. By developing an effective program,
she was able to obtain continued funding from
local community organizations such as the
Kiwanis and Lions Clubs.
"It helped me get a much better understand
ing of what it means to be in a non-profit or
ganization," Butler said. "And I did a great deal
of things that I would not have otherwise been
able to do."
Senior Stacey Marina was also a fellowship
recipient in 1985. Marina served as a counselor
and patient advocate at a women's health center
in Cleveland, Ohio.
"Most of my work centered around three
basic areas: pregnancy tests, contraceptive
counseling and sexually transmitted diseases. I
would talk to incoming patients about whatever
problem they were having. I tried to give them
an overview of their options, let them choose
and then give them more specific information,"
Marina said.

Marina called her experience "the best thing
that ever happened to me. 1 helped others and
they helped me decide my future."
Students with unique project plans are en
couraged to apply for sponsorship at the Public
Service Center by April 7. Applications will be
judged on creativity, innovation, practicality
and degree of service to the community.
The selection committee, which consists of
students, faculty, staff and community leaders,
awards grants of up to $1,200 to students on the
basis of the application and an interview.
The committee's main purpose is to award
money to students, who then can design and
implement important community programs that
otherwise would have never existed.
In addition, members of the committee said
that they hope by making interestirg public ser
vice opportunities available, â€¢ u.dents will be
more apt to consider the ad' mtages of public
service work in the future.
Like Butler and Marina, senior Deep Singh
said he benefitted considerably from his sum
mer fellowship. Singh worked for the Ecumeni
cal Hunger Program in East Palo Alto, helping
to keep things organized and running smoothly.
Singh spent a lot of time visiting individual
families, and he noted that the Ecumenical
Hunger Program made a difference in many
people's lives.
One dramatic example occurred in the family
of a mother with two retarded children and a
third who had problems in school.
"The house was filthy, and the mother was
very depressed," Singh recalled. After volun
teers arranged to have the carpets cleaned and
the house painted, the mother became much
more talkative and more responsible for her
own finances, he said.
"It's the little changes that mean a lot," he
said.
After their summer fellowship service, all
three recipients have returned to Stanford and
been able to share their stories with other stu
dents in formal presentations and informal con
versations in dorms.
Applications for the program may be ob
tained at Owen House, which is open on week
days from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.
