# Soviet offers Lenin
## 
### TROY EID Senior staff writer 
In his first official response to an
invitation from the senior class presi
dents to speak at Commencement,
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has
declined an offer to visit the Univer
sity this year but pledged to dispatch
famed predecessor Vladimir Lenin to
Stanford "as his plans permit."
In a March 13 letter to University
President Donald Kennedy, Gorba
chev called Lenin a "proven attrac
tion" whose presence at Commence
ment would be "very much in step
with the solemn qature of the occa
sion."
"Lenin always had a keen ap
preciation of ceremony, and I am
prdud and delighted that he will be
exposed to a class that will be influen
tial in the world of tomorrow," Gor
bachev said in the letter. "In my
country, Vladya continues to draw
huge lines of onlookers, and I am
confident his arrival on the Stanford
campus will recall the days of
registration in Maples Pavilion."
Aides to Kennedy, who have
repeatedly sought to distance the
president from the Gorbachev invita
tion, reacted angrily to the Soviet
leader's suggestion that Commence
ment exercises be moved from Stan
ford Stadium to the Quad to accom
modate a full-scale military parade
featuring Soviet tanks and heavy in
fantry.
"It's not fair," said one Kennedy
associate. "We finally get all the tiles
to stick and finish the rosette, and
then Gorby sends in the SS-195."
At a hastily arranged press confer
ence outside his office, a visibly
shaken Kennedy IoW ref»orters that
Lenin would be temporarily stored in
the tamper-proof glass display case at
Tresidder Union that is currently
home to the Big Game Axe.
"I know you don't get people like
Mr. Lenin dropping in every day, but
at least he's not asking for an
honorary degree," Kennedy said,
managing a faint smile.
In response to questions from
reporters, Kennedy added, "I have
no plans — none whatsoever! — to
run for the Supreme Soviet."
Western analysts agreed that the
Gorbachev letter has placed Ken
nedy, who had already invited ABC
news anchor Ted Koppel to speak at
the June 15 ceremony, in an espe
cially awkward position. Top advisers
to Kennedy have hinted at a compro
mise in which Lenin, mounted in a
special acrylic display stand, could be
stood upright and used as a podium
during Koppel's address.
"Nobody's sure it will work," said
one Kennedy confidant. "It's been 60
some years and Lenin's still taller
than Koppel. That translates into all
sorts of problems."
Campus reaction to the Gorbachev
letter was generally enthusiastic. Fol
lowing an extraordinary closed inter
departmental meeting, officials from
the Human Biology Program vowed
to divert enough formaldehyde from
Stanford laboratories "to keep our
Catatonic Comrade comfortable."
KZSU announced a special Com
mencement broadcast "highlighting
his career, from 'Imperialism: The
Highest Stage of Capitalism' to' Let It
Be,' " and freshmen from Branner
Hall said they would post a 24-hour
guard around Lenin during his
campus stay.
Senior Mark Fleischauer, the
Roble resident assistant who spear
headed the drive to bring Gorbachev
to Stanford, disputed reports that by
welcoming Lenin to the Farm, the
University would have to settle for
"second best."
"I think everybody who wasn't ab
solutely naive understood it was a
very, very long shot to get Gorba
chev," Fleischauer said.
Lenin, who has spent much of the
last 60 years in a small brick building
on Moscow's Red Square, could not
be reached for comment yesterday.
