# Quakes shake, wake the state

"It was the mdst action my dorm room has seen.
The rumbling was so great I thought I was dread
ing," said Richard Dantas of Roble Hall, referring
to the earthquake that sent shudders through the
Stanford campus shortly before 4 a.m. yester
day. *
The quake measured 5.3 on the Richter scale
and was centered 15 miles southeast of Fremont.
At least eight aftershocks ranging from 3.6 to 3.8
had already been recorded late last night, according
to the state Office of Emergency Services.
In addition to a few minor injuries that have
been reported, the quake created power outages in
San Jose and Fremont.
The quake was third in the past three days. Ac-

cording to Bill Ellsworth, geophysicist for the U.S.
Geological Survey, the preponderance of seismic
activity serves as an indication that "the strains that
were relaxed in 1906 (wffjch measured 8.3 on the
Richter scale) are accumulating again. We had
about 50 years of relative quiet, but now the faults
are definitely more active," he said in an Associ
ated Press interview.
Prof. James Gere, co-director of Stanford's
Blume Earthquake Engineering Center, said there
have been "at least 20 small aftershocks since 4
yesterday morning." The seismograph in front of
Terman Engineering Library did not record the ac
tual temblor because "the shaking exceeded the
recording limit. The settings are sensitized for small
local quakes, and yesterday's was off the scale," ac
cording to Gere.
Earthquakes with the intensity of yesterday's

"will do a little damage but not anything major. It
is when you have quakes measuring 6.5 to 7.0 on
the Richter scale that you're going to have serious
damage to older weaker buildings," Gere said.
The Richter scale is logarithmic in that "as you
go up by a factor of one on the magnitude scale,
you go up by a factor of 10 in the intensity of
ground shake and by a factor of 30 in terms of the
energy released by the quake," Gere said.
Therefore, an earthquake measuring 7.3 would
have 100 times more groundshake and release 900
times more energy than did yesterday's quake mea
suring 5.3.
Many people find it disturbing that no reliable
method for predicting earthquakes exists. Res
ponding to these concerns, Gere said,
