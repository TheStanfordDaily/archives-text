# Study: profits from divesting
## Prof. says divestment, earnings mix 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
It is possible to design a stock
portfolio that is both devoid of invest
ments in companies involved with
apartheid-ruled South Africa and
financially superior to portfolios that
include investments in those compan
ies, according to a Graduate School
of Business study.
Even with the cost of divestment, a
South Africa-free portfolio can be
more profitable than one with ties to
the racially segregated nation, Busi
ness School Professor William Sharpe
said in a press release. Sharpe and
Wells Fargo portfolio manager Blake
Grossman conducted the study.
But the profitability of divestment
is not the only issue facing the Uni
versity as it determines its invest
ments, according to Trustee James
Ware.
The University currently examines
the conduct of a company and makes
a decision — independent of profit —
on whether or not to hold stock in
that company, Ware said.
This policy of selective divestment,
adopted by the Board of Trustees in
favor of blanket divestment, gives the
University the option of working with
companies to improve the situation in
South Africa, according to Ware.
The issue concerning South Africa
is a moral issue, not one of
profitability, he said.
The study, however, does not ad
dress the political and moral issues in
volved in divestment. It focuses in
stead on the financial aspects of such
amove. • •• . K.
"We have no expectations con
cerning the political implications and
thus must leave that side of the issue
to others," Sharpe said.
Looking only at the financial impli
cations of divestment, Sharpe cites
the facts that South Africa-free
portfolios include stocks from com
panies slightly smaller than those
listed on the New York Stock Ex
change and that investments in
smaller companies are historically
more profitable.
This phenomenon of small com

panies yielding greater profits, known
as the small stock effect, is not fully
understood, but "there is little reason
to assume that future behavior will
differ significantly from that of the
past," Sharpe said in the release.
One drawback of investing in
smaller companies is a loss of li
quidity. Liquidity refers to the ease
with which one can purchase or sell
stock in a company. Bigger compan
ies, like IBM, issue more stock, are
more in demand and therefore are
easier to trade.
"Whether the resulting portfolio is
better or worse depends a lot on how
important liquidity is," Sharpe said.
If the University invested in
smaller companies not affiliated with
South Africa, it could not acquire sig
nificant amounts of stock in any one
company while maintaining the li
quidity of the portfolio, according to
Treasurer Rodney Adams.
An investor faced with a non-liquid
portfolio would need to invest in
other securities to mitigate the prob
lem and attain more liquidity, Adams
said.
Balancing the liquidity and profits
associated with smaller companies is
"easier done in a study than by indi
viduals," he added.
The Business School study also
calls for investors to manage their
portfolio passively — buying and sel
ling to try to mimic an index. In
passive management, investors trade
not because of some inside knowl
edge about the stocks' future but be
cause they want to achieve a balance
of stocks.
offers the opportunity
to negotiate with brokers at a reduced
transaction rate because the goal in
selling is not to unload a stock that
the investor believes is slipping in
value, but to achieve balance in his
portfolio.
Passive management is a very un
usual change in approach and raises
questions about its prudence, Adams
said.
The study suggests that a change to
passive management would offer
