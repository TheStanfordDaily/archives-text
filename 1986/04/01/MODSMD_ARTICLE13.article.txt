# Experts split on impact of Libyan hostilities
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Analysts are divided over the long-term im
pact of last week's confrontation between the
United States and Libya in the Gulf of Sidra,
but they agree that the incident had an impor
tant short-term effect on American morale.
David Gress, a senior research fellow in in
ternational relations at the Hoover Institu
tion, said the confrontation was not as much a
concerted effort by the Reagan Administra
tion to teach Libyan leader Col. Moammar
t Khadafi a lesson as it was something that

"just happened."
He noted the Administration's concern
over reported Libyan involvement in terrorist
attacks at airports in Vienna and Rome last
December, but added that the decisive issue
precipitating the crisis was the so-called "Line
of Death" Khadafi drew across the Gulf of
Sidra as far as 160 miles from the Libyan
coastline.
"It wasn't the conflict the United States
would have chosen if it had wanted to teach
Khadafi a lesson," Gress said.
But there are questions about whether the
incident was accidental. In public statements

throughout the crisis, White House spokes
man Larry Speakes insisted the only reason
the Navy entered the gulf was to assert the
United States' right — and by extension, the
right of every nation — to travel outside the
generally accepted 12-mile international
navigation limit extending from coastlines.
Privately, however, anonymous officials ac
knowledged that the Navy's presence had the
added purpose of emphasizing the Adminis
tration's stand on international terrorism, ac
cording to an article in the San Jose Mercury
News.
Officials said that when the most recent

round of Mediterranean naval exercises were
discussed March 14, the president specifically
authorized commanders on the scene to
destroy the missile base at Sirte, Libya if ne
cessary. Officials said they also discussed the
potential for attacks by Libyan patrol boats,
according to the Mercury News.
Once the Administration decided there was
enough evidence to conclude Khadafi was be
hind the terrorist attacks in Vienna and
Rome, it tried to convince America's allies in
Europe to apply sanctions against Libya.
Those efforts fell through.
One State Department official summed up

the Administration's decision to go ahead
with naval maneuvers this way: "When
Khadafi tossed out a challenge like that (the
"Line of Death"), we had no choice but to
respond."
Whatever the Administration's intent in or
dering vessels to cross the Line of Death,
Gress said the short-term effect was clear.
"The incident tells Khadafi that the United
States has the right to navigate in interna
tional waters," he said.
As for the message the Administration may
have intended to send Khadafi about
terrorism, Gress said, "I don't think
this (incident) will necessarily have
any particular effect at all (on
Khadafi's alleged backing of terror
ists)."
The confrontation did have an im
portant short-term impact, both in
Libya and at home, according to
analysts. A poll conducted by USA
Today showed that 83 percent of
those surveyed said they are "glad
that the United States is standing up
for rights around the world even if it
means taking some military risks."
Peter Duignan, curator of the
African and Middle East collection at
Hoover Institution, told the Mercury
News the incident demonstrated "our
anger and impatience with a petty
tyrant who has disturbed not only
Africa and the Middle East but the
rest of the world with his arming and
training of terrorists."
Some analysts emphasized that the
short-term support of the American
people for the "sanitary" action in
Libya would not translate into sup
port of a longer conflict, either in the
Middle East or in Central America,
for which the Sidra incident was
rumored by some observers to be a
smokescreen.
Gress dismissed speculation that
the incident was an attempt to divert
the attention of the American public

away from the House's rejection of
President Reagan's contra aid pack
age, calling them "conspiracy
theories."
"They (conspiracy theories) are
easy to do," Gress said, "but they
don't explain [the incident]."
Gress added that public opinion
would not be an important considera
tion in Administration policy were a
war to become imminent.
"I can't say there would be public
support beforehand for an extended
military action," Gress said. "But
public opinion can be often as wrong
as it is right, and the question would
be one of the Administration wanting
to do it (become involved in a
protracted conflict) regardless of
public opinion."
One possible long-term effect of
the hostilities about which observers
are worried is the straining of the re
lationship between Washington and
moderate Arab nations. Laurence
Michalak, coordinator of the Center
for Middle East Studies at the UC-
Berkeley, told the Mercury News that
the Sidra incident will be
"counterproductive in the Arab
world."
Additionally, in an article to be
published in this spring's Stanford
Magazine, Asst. Prof. Joel Beinin, a
specialist in Middle Eastern history,
notes that Arab countries tend to
unite against common enemies no
matter how deep internal divisions
run.
Beinin writes that political borders
between Arab countries are seen by
Arabs as "false divisions whose
origins are due to the political mach
inations of European colonialism."
Despite these viewpoints, Gress
sees no reason for undue alarm over
the possibility of Arab nations be
coming angry about the hostilities in
the Gulf of Sidra. "What can you do
(to please them)?" he asked. "Not a
hell of a lot, besides ditching Israel."
"What are you going to do? Allow
khadafi to push you around because
you don't want to appear anti-
Arab?" Gress said. "I don't think
there was much choice."
As for the incident's effect on
Khadafi himself, Gress said the con
frontation had the Libyan strongman
genuinely "scared" even though his
news agency proclaimed a "glittering
victory" when the Sixth Fleet left the
Gulf of Sidra toward the end of last
week. Khadafi was "very much at
risk," Gress said, and he "did what
any smart person would do" under
the circumstances: after the first two
days of fighting, Khadafi ordered
gunfire to be withheld.
Otherwise, Gress said, the United
States would have had reason to go in
and widen the conflict by attacking
Libyan airfields.

Otherwise, Gress said, the United
States would have had reason to go in
and widen the conflict by attacking
Libyan airfields.
Analysts are divided over the long-term im
pact of last week's confrontation between the
United States and Libya in the Gulf of Sidra,
but they agree that the incident had an impor
tant short-term effect on American morale.
David Gress, a senior research fellow in in
ternational relations at the Hoover Institu
tion, said the confrontation was not as much a
concerted effort by the Reagan Administra
tion to teach Libyan leader Col. Moammar
t Khadafi a lesson as it was something that

"just happened."
He noted the Administration's concern
over reported Libyan involvement in terrorist
attacks at airports in Vienna and Rome last
December, but added that the decisive issue
precipitating the crisis was the so-called "Line
of Death" Khadafi drew across the Gulf of
Sidra as far as 160 miles from the Libyan
coastline.
"It wasn't the conflict the United States
would have chosen if it had wanted to teach
Khadafi a lesson," Gress said.
But there are questions about whether the
incident was accidental. In public statements

throughout the crisis, White House spokes
man Larry Speakes insisted the only reason
the Navy entered the gulf was to assert the
United States' right — and by extension, the
right of every nation — to travel outside the
generally accepted 12-mile international
navigation limit extending from coastlines.
Privately, however, anonymous officials ac
knowledged that the Navy's presence had the
added purpose of emphasizing the Adminis
tration's stand on international terrorism, ac
cording to an article in the San Jose Mercury
News.
Officials said that when the most recent

round of Mediterranean naval exercises were
discussed March 14, the president specifically
authorized commanders on the scene to
destroy the missile base at Sirte, Libya if ne
cessary. Officials said they also discussed the
potential for attacks by Libyan patrol boats,
according to the Mercury News.
Once the Administration decided there was
enough evidence to conclude Khadafi was be
hind the terrorist attacks in Vienna and
Rome, it tried to convince America's allies in
Europe to apply sanctions against Libya.
Those efforts fell through.
One State Department official summed up

the Administration's decision to go ahead
with naval maneuvers this way: "When
Khadafi tossed out a challenge like that (the
"Line of Death"), we had no choice but to
respond."
Whatever the Administration's intent in or
dering vessels to cross the Line of Death,
Gress said the short-term effect was clear.
"The incident tells Khadafi that the United
States has the right to navigate in interna
tional waters," he said.
As for the message the Administration may
have intended to send Khadafi about
terrorism, Gress said, "I don't think
this (incident) will necessarily have
any particular effect at all (on
Khadafi's alleged backing of terror
ists)."
The confrontation did have an im
portant short-term impact, both in
Libya and at home, according to
analysts. A poll conducted by USA
Today showed that 83 percent of
those surveyed said they are "glad
that the United States is standing up
for rights around the world even if it
means taking some military risks."
Peter Duignan, curator of the
African and Middle East collection at
Hoover Institution, told the Mercury
News the incident demonstrated "our
anger and impatience with a petty
tyrant who has disturbed not only
Africa and the Middle East but the
rest of the world with his arming and
training of terrorists."
Some analysts emphasized that the
short-term support of the American
people for the "sanitary" action in
Libya would not translate into sup
port of a longer conflict, either in the
Middle East or in Central America,
for which the Sidra incident was
rumored by some observers to be a
smokescreen.
Gress dismissed speculation that
the incident was an attempt to divert
the attention of the American public

away from the House's rejection of
President Reagan's contra aid pack
age, calling them "conspiracy
theories."
"They (conspiracy theories) are
easy to do," Gress said, "but they
don't explain [the incident]."
Gress added that public opinion
would not be an important considera
tion in Administration policy were a
war to become imminent.
"I can't say there would be public
support beforehand for an extended
military action," Gress said. "But
public opinion can be often as wrong
as it is right, and the question would
be one of the Administration wanting
to do it (become involved in a
protracted conflict) regardless of
public opinion."
One possible long-term effect of
the hostilities about which observers
are worried is the straining of the re
lationship between Washington and
moderate Arab nations. Laurence
Michalak, coordinator of the Center
for Middle East Studies at the UC-
Berkeley, told the Mercury News that
the Sidra incident will be
"counterproductive in the Arab
world."
Additionally, in an article to be
published in this spring's Stanford
Magazine, Asst. Prof. Joel Beinin, a
specialist in Middle Eastern history,
notes that Arab countries tend to
unite against common enemies no
matter how deep internal divisions
run.
Beinin writes that political borders
between Arab countries are seen by
Arabs as "false divisions whose
origins are due to the political mach
inations of European colonialism."
Despite these viewpoints, Gress
sees no reason for undue alarm over
the possibility of Arab nations be
coming angry about the hostilities in
the Gulf of Sidra. "What can you do
(to please them)?" he asked. "Not a
hell of a lot, besides ditching Israel."
"What are you going to do? Allow
khadafi to push you around because
you don't want to appear anti-
Arab?" Gress said. "I don't think
there was much choice."
As for the incident's effect on
Khadafi himself, Gress said the con
frontation had the Libyan strongman
genuinely "scared" even though his
news agency proclaimed a "glittering
victory" when the Sixth Fleet left the
Gulf of Sidra toward the end of last
week. Khadafi was "very much at
risk," Gress said, and he "did what
any smart person would do" under
the circumstances: after the first two
days of fighting, Khadafi ordered
gunfire to be withheld.
Otherwise, Gress said, the United
States would have had reason to go in
and widen the conflict by attacking
Libyan airfields.
