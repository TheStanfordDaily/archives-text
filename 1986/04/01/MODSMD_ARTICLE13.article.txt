# Experts split on impact of Libyan hostilities

Analysts are divided over the long-term im
pact of last week's confrontation between the
United States and Libya in the Gulf of Sidra,
but they agree that the incident had an impor
tant short-term effect on American morale.
David Gress, a senior research fellow in in
ternational relations at the Hoover Institu
tion, said the confrontation was not as much a
concerted effort by the Reagan Administra
tion to teach Libyan leader Col. Moammar
t Khadafi a lesson as it was something that

"just happened."
He noted the Administration's concern
over reported Libyan involvement in terrorist
attacks at airports in Vienna and Rome last
December, but added that the decisive issue
precipitating the crisis was the so-called "Line
of Death" Khadafi drew across the Gulf of
Sidra as far as 160 miles from the Libyan
coastline.
"It wasn't the conflict the United States
would have chosen if it had wanted to teach
Khadafi a lesson," Gress said.
But there are questions about whether the
incident was accidental. In public statements

throughout the crisis, White House spokes
man Larry Speakes insisted the only reason
the Navy entered the gulf was to assert the
United States' right — and by extension, the
right of every nation — to travel outside the
generally accepted 12-mile international
navigation limit extending from coastlines.
Privately, however, anonymous officials ac
knowledged that the Navy's presence had the
added purpose of emphasizing the Adminis
tration's stand on international terrorism, ac
cording to an article in the San Jose Mercury
News.
Officials said that when the most recent

round of Mediterranean naval exercises were
discussed March 14, the president specifically
authorized commanders on the scene to
destroy the missile base at Sirte, Libya if ne
cessary. Officials said they also discussed the
potential for attacks by Libyan patrol boats,
according to the Mercury News.
Once the Administration decided there was
enough evidence to conclude Khadafi was be
hind the terrorist attacks in Vienna and
Rome, it tried to convince America's allies in
Europe to apply sanctions against Libya.
Those efforts fell through.
One State Department official summed up

the Administration's decision to go ahead
with naval maneuvers this way: "When
Khadafi tossed out a challenge like that (the
"Line of Death"), we had no choice but to
respond."
Whatever the Administration's intent in or
dering vessels to cross the Line of Death,
Gress said the short-term effect was clear.
"The incident tells Khadafi that the United
States has the right to navigate in interna
tional waters," he said.
As for the message the Administration may
