Roger was a walking case history
of how to have a heart attack.
A 48-year-old father, Roger was
overweight, lived on a diet of meat
and potatoes and rich desserts, and

Feature

from the age of 23 smoked a pack
of cigarettes a day. He never exer
cised and pushed himself to the
limit at his high-pressure job.
Roger felt perfectly healthy —
until he had his first heart attack.
Five months later he was dead.
This case is one of many that left

a deep impression on Dr. John Far
quhar, Stanford's dean of disease
prevention. After all, Roger wasn't
that old. He just happened to be
unfortunate enough to be among
the 425,000 Americans under the
age of 75 who die prematurely each
year as a result of diseases of the
heart and blood vessels.
Roger is described in Farquhar's
book, "The American Way of Life
Need Not Be Hazardous to Your
Health."
Farquhar, who heads one of
three large experimental disease
prevention programs in this
country, believes that at least 90
percent of fatal and near-fatal
premature strokes and heart at

tacks can be prevented by develop
ing better living habits.
"By the way you live, you greatly
determine not only the length of
your life, but also the quality of
your life," he says in his book.
Prompted by deaths such as
Roger's, Farquhar began taking a
serious look at the factors of heart
disease. In the process, the pres
tigious Stanford Center for Re
search in Disease Prevention was
born.
Started in 1984, the center incor
porates the activities of the 15-
year-old Stanford Heart Disease
Prevention Program and expands
the research into areas beyond car
diovascular diseases.
Engaged in health education re
search, the center seeks methods to
improve the overall level of commu
nity health by modifying factors such
as blood pressure, blood cholesterol,
cigarette use, obesity, physical inac
tivity and stress.
Farquhar is certainly not alone in
his work of prevention. He is comple
mented by physician-researchers
common to most experimental pro
grams, but to that core he has added
epidemiologists, behavioral scientists,
communications researchers, statis
ticians, exercise specialists,
nutritionists, psychiatrists, educators
and other health professionals.
Stanford Five City Project
At the core of the research pro
gram is a $24 million long-term ex
perimental field study focused on
entire communities. It's called the
Stanford Five City Project (FCP) and
is testing the hypothesis that commu
nity health education programs can
produce valuable decreases in heart
disease rates.
Researchers set out in 1978 with
the aim of achieving a 10 to 20 per
cent reduction in stroke and coronary
heart disease.
Three "control" communities and
the two "education" communities of
Monterey and Salinas in northern and
central California were chosen for
study.
"We needed a community that was
not unrepresentational of the na
tion," Farquhar said.

The Five City Project includes
courses for health professionals, use
of television and radio public service
announcements, countless brochures,
stop-smoking contests and even
printed messages stuffed into grocery
bags.

"There's no right program for
everyone," said Dr. June Flora,
director of education for the Stanford
program. "We try to match the pro
gram with the person."
Although the study will not be
completed for a number of years
—"never," according to Farquhar,
who hopes the communities will con
tinue educating their residents about
disease prevention even after Stan
ford finishes — recent short-term
results show "satisfactory and pro
gressive changes" in areas such as

smoking and blood pressure, accord
ing to the interim report.
The hope is that the lessons learned
in these field studies will be applica
ble in communities across the nation.
Stanford Health Improvement Pro
gram
Another major service area of the
center hits closer to home. It's called
the Stanford Health Improvement
Program (HIP).
Sponsored by the University and
hospital personnel departments, HIP
offers classes for all faculty and staff
members and their families.
"We are telling other people how
to do these things, but we weren't
taking care of our own community,"
Farquhar said.
Classes cover most of the principal
forms of exercise, as well as other
areas beneficial to health. There are
classes in aerobics, swimming, weight
control, stress management, nutrition
and smoking cessation.
Farquhar said many of the offer
ings are collaborative with Cowcll
Student Health Center to "benefit
the health of the entire Stanford com
munity, including students."
But there is a lot more to adminis
tering an exercise program than
hiring an instructor and signing up
participants. A special program for
the Operations and Mainte
nance/Utilities workers shows how
HIP helps to keep employees par
ticipating in exercise.
"We used the method of a contest
between the various shops," said HIP
program manager Fran Carl. "We
had a public display of large charts in

each shop where the men would
record the number of exercise ses
sions they had per week . . . and then
we offered group prizes to the win
ning shops and individual prizes such
as T-shirts and free tickets as incen
tives."
The program helped a lot of men in
the department, but nobody more
than Steve Papier.
Before the special exercise pro
gram, he weighed 224 pounds, his

blood pressure was a threatening
1 50/94 and his heart pounded away
at 131 beats a minute after he
finished a three-minute exercise test.
Ihree months later, he weighed
194. his blood pressure was 120/80
and his post-exercise heart rate was
94.

Besides the exercise classes, HIP
offers programs like "Drop it Off:
Weight Loss by Mail" and "QUIT
Smoking."
The QUIT classes had their highest
enrollment ever when the no
smoking policy went into effect at
Stanford on Jan. 1, 1985.
Burton Richter, winner of the
Nobel Prize and director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, was
one person who opposed the no
smoking policy. He labeled the
framers "self-righteous" and
"fanatical non-smokers."
When he was forced to tell his
SLAC employees that they couldn't
smoke anymore, Richter decided to
be the first to take the plunge and en
rolled in the QUIT class. Now consid
ered one of the big successes of the
University's policy, he considers him
self "99 and 44/100 percent pure."
Surveys conducted by HIP and pre
sented at the no-smoking task force
meeting last week show 92 percent of
the Stanford community favoring the
present policy or more restrictive
guidelines.
As it stands now, the policy
prohibits smoking in indoor locations
where smokers and non-smokers oc
cupy the same area.
About 10 percent of Stanford's
employees participate in at least one
HIP program. Carl said that the pro
grams are regarded as good for em
ployee morale and probably reduce
absenteeism, but that no studies have
been conducted yet to prove those
points.
The disease center has become a
model for scientists all over the
world. The community studies have

been successfully copied both in thjs
nation as well as in Australia and
Switzerland. ''
The center's work has been sup
ported almost exclusively by the Na
tional Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute of the National Institutes of
Health. • •
Future projects for the center in
clude plans to investigate different
levels of physical activity in middle
aged individuals, to study the associa
tion of coffee drinking with high
cholesterol levels, and to study the
prevention of cigarette smoking
among adolescent women.

Overall, Farquhar stressed the cen-.
ter's endeavor to "activate the public J
to get more aggressive, more as-»
sertive" about their personal health. )

Roger was a walking case history
of how to have a heart attack.
A 48-year-old father, Roger was
overweight, lived on a diet of meat
and potatoes and rich desserts, and

Feature

from the age of 23 smoked a pack
of cigarettes a day. He never exer
cised and pushed himself to the
limit at his high-pressure job.
Roger felt perfectly healthy —
until he had his first heart attack.
Five months later he was dead.
This case is one of many that left

a deep impression on Dr. John Far
quhar, Stanford's dean of disease
prevention. After all, Roger wasn't
that old. He just happened to be
unfortunate enough to be among
the 425,000 Americans under the
age of 75 who die prematurely each
year as a result of diseases of the
heart and blood vessels.
Roger is described in Farquhar's
book, "The American Way of Life
Need Not Be Hazardous to Your
Health."
Farquhar, who heads one of
three large experimental disease
prevention programs in this
country, believes that at least 90
percent of fatal and near-fatal
premature strokes and heart at

tacks can be prevented by develop
ing better living habits.
"By the way you live, you greatly
determine not only the length of
your life, but also the quality of
your life," he says in his book.
Prompted by deaths such as
Roger's, Farquhar began taking a
serious look at the factors of heart
disease. In the process, the pres
tigious Stanford Center for Re
search in Disease Prevention was
born.
Started in 1984, the center incor
porates the activities of the 15-
year-old Stanford Heart Disease
Prevention Program and expands
the research into areas beyond car
diovascular diseases.
Engaged in health education re
search, the center seeks methods to
improve the overall level of commu
nity health by modifying factors such
as blood pressure, blood cholesterol,
cigarette use, obesity, physical inac
tivity and stress.
Farquhar is certainly not alone in
his work of prevention. He is comple
mented by physician-researchers
common to most experimental pro
grams, but to that core he has added
epidemiologists, behavioral scientists,
communications researchers, statis
ticians, exercise specialists,
nutritionists, psychiatrists, educators
and other health professionals.
Stanford Five City Project
At the core of the research pro
gram is a $24 million long-term ex
perimental field study focused on
entire communities. It's called the
Stanford Five City Project (FCP) and
is testing the hypothesis that commu
nity health education programs can
produce valuable decreases in heart
disease rates.
Researchers set out in 1978 with
the aim of achieving a 10 to 20 per
cent reduction in stroke and coronary
heart disease.
Three "control" communities and
the two "education" communities of
Monterey and Salinas in northern and
central California were chosen for
study.
"We needed a community that was
not unrepresentational of the na
tion," Farquhar said.

The Five City Project includes
courses for health professionals, use
of television and radio public service
announcements, countless brochures,
stop-smoking contests and even
printed messages stuffed into grocery
bags.

"There's no right program for
everyone," said Dr. June Flora,
director of education for the Stanford
program. "We try to match the pro
gram with the person."
Although the study will not be
completed for a number of years
—"never," according to Farquhar,
who hopes the communities will con
tinue educating their residents about
disease prevention even after Stan
ford finishes — recent short-term
results show "satisfactory and pro
gressive changes" in areas such as

smoking and blood pressure, accord
ing to the interim report.
The hope is that the lessons learned
in these field studies will be applica
ble in communities across the nation.
Stanford Health Improvement Pro
gram
Another major service area of the
center hits closer to home. It's called
the Stanford Health Improvement
Program (HIP).
Sponsored by the University and
hospital personnel departments, HIP
offers classes for all faculty and staff
members and their families.
"We are telling other people how
to do these things, but we weren't
taking care of our own community,"
Farquhar said.
Classes cover most of the principal
forms of exercise, as well as other
areas beneficial to health. There are
classes in aerobics, swimming, weight
control, stress management, nutrition
and smoking cessation.
Farquhar said many of the offer
ings are collaborative with Cowcll
Student Health Center to "benefit
the health of the entire Stanford com
munity, including students."
But there is a lot more to adminis
tering an exercise program than
hiring an instructor and signing up
participants. A special program for
the Operations and Mainte
nance/Utilities workers shows how
HIP helps to keep employees par
ticipating in exercise.
"We used the method of a contest
between the various shops," said HIP
program manager Fran Carl. "We
had a public display of large charts in

each shop where the men would
record the number of exercise ses
sions they had per week . . . and then
we offered group prizes to the win
ning shops and individual prizes such
as T-shirts and free tickets as incen
tives."
The program helped a lot of men in
the department, but nobody more
than Steve Papier.
Before the special exercise pro
gram, he weighed 224 pounds, his

blood pressure was a threatening
1 50/94 and his heart pounded away
at 131 beats a minute after he
finished a three-minute exercise test.
Ihree months later, he weighed
194. his blood pressure was 120/80
and his post-exercise heart rate was
94.

Besides the exercise classes, HIP
offers programs like "Drop it Off:
Weight Loss by Mail" and "QUIT
Smoking."
The QUIT classes had their highest
enrollment ever when the no
smoking policy went into effect at
Stanford on Jan. 1, 1985.
Burton Richter, winner of the
Nobel Prize and director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, was
one person who opposed the no
smoking policy. He labeled the
framers "self-righteous" and
"fanatical non-smokers."
When he was forced to tell his
SLAC employees that they couldn't
smoke anymore, Richter decided to
be the first to take the plunge and en
rolled in the QUIT class. Now consid
ered one of the big successes of the
University's policy, he considers him
self "99 and 44/100 percent pure."
Surveys conducted by HIP and pre
sented at the no-smoking task force
meeting last week show 92 percent of
the Stanford community favoring the
present policy or more restrictive
guidelines.
As it stands now, the policy
prohibits smoking in indoor locations
where smokers and non-smokers oc
cupy the same area.
About 10 percent of Stanford's
employees participate in at least one
HIP program. Carl said that the pro
grams are regarded as good for em
ployee morale and probably reduce
absenteeism, but that no studies have
been conducted yet to prove those
points.
The disease center has become a
model for scientists all over the
world. The community studies have

been successfully copied both in thjs
nation as well as in Australia and
