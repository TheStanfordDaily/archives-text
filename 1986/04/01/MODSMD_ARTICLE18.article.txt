# Five varsity sports lose funding
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger announced last month that
funding for five varsity sports will be
eliminated from the Athletic Depart
ment budget at the beginning of their
1986-87 seasons.
In a cost-cutting move aimed at re
ducing a projected 2.3 million deficit
in the Athletic Department over the
next four years, Geiger slashed
Softball, wrestling, field hockey, and
men's and women's fencing.
"It is with deep regret and sadness
that we are forced to come to the con
clusion that we must cut back parts of
our program," Geiger said. "We still
have financial problems."
The elimination of the five sports
will save an estimated $200,000 to
$250,000 a year in operating ex
penses and another $200,000 in
scholarship aid. Full savings on schol
arship expenses will not be realized
until the 1989-90 academic year,
however, as the University will honor
all scholarships currently granted to
athletes.
The budget move will not nec
cesarily sound the death knell for the
sports, though, as the teams will in all
likelihood be able to retain varsity
status despite their lack of University
funding.

"We would like to make it clear
that while we are eliminating funds
for those five sports, it does not mean
that those five sports will disappear,"
Geiger said. "In fact each sport will
probably continue, but only on a to
tally self-supporting basis."

'It is with deep
regret and sadness
that we are forced
to come to the
conclusion that we
must cut back
parts of our pro
gram.'

"I'm hoping that there will be very
little change," Stanford Wrestling
Coach Chris Horpel said. "All the
sports are still able to compete in con
ference and NCAA championships,

which is the difference between club
sports and varsity sports."
Horpel said he is hoping for in
creased support from the Friends of
Stanford Wrestling, an alumni sup
port group for the wrestling team,
and other sports will be forced to turn

to other avenues of support as well.
Currently, the fencing teams are the
only other squads to have similar
alumni groups.
A total of 78 students are members

of the teams that will be affected by
the budget cuts, and Geiger did not
eliminate the possibility of further
cuts in the financially strapped de
partment.
"We've been operating on a zero
growth basis for the past three years,"
he said. "The elimination of funding
for certain sports was the last resort.
Either our base of support grows or
we must cut back further, and at this
time I see no indication that our base
of support is growing."
Geiger noted that although his de
partment will only support 23 varsity
sports, "We still have one of the
more, if not the most, broadly based
programs on the West Coast."
Horpel, however, said he does not
agree with the cuts.
"It (wrestling) is just more expen
dable than others," he said. "[The
cut] doesn't make much sense to me
because [wrestling is] relatively inex
pensive
Four of the five sports being cut
finished among the top 30 in the
country this season. Wrestling
recently copped a 29th-place finish in
the NCAAs, while field hockey was
one of the 12 teams to qualify for the
NCAA tourney last fall. The men's
and women's fencing teams finished
14th and sixth respectively in the
country.
