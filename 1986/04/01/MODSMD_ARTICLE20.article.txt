## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Respect Fetter's choice 
### 
Up until abftut two weeks ago, the Stanford basket
ball program looked to be solidly on its way to respec
tability. Coach Tom Davis' young, exciting team chal
lenged for a berth in a postseason tournament right up
to the end of February, and with another crop of blue
chippers expected to enter the Farm in the fall, Stan
ford's hoop future looked rosier than it had in decades.
And then, on March 21, Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter stuffed Davis' best shot. Chris Munk, the 6-
foot-9 power forward from San Francisco whom Dr.
Tom was hoping would join sophomores Todd Lichti
and Howard Wright to push the Cardinal over the top,
was denied admission to the class of 1990.
Shortly thereafter, a disillusioned Davis flew to
Houston to discuss accepting the head coaching job
there. "I am very disappointed," he said in a prepared
press statement. "I feel the decision (to turn down
Munk) is Stanford's loss."
It may be. Admittedly Munk's academic record is
not outstanding; not too long ago, his high school GPA
stood at 2.2. But with some encouragement from the
Stanford coaching staff, Munk took the SATs four
times, strengthened his high school curriculum and
raised his GPA to its current level of 2.8.

That is why Davis is disappointed, and that is why it
might seem unreasonable that Fetter has rejected a
young man with a special athletic talent and an appar
ent desire to succeed academically. Munk would have
contributed to the school in a very visible way, and he
might have ended up handling his academic duties as
well as any other scholar/athlete here.
But we feel it is not our place to pass judgement on
decisions made by the Department of Admissions. The
Stanford admissions process is a careful and compre
hensive procedure, one that considers many things
besides grade points, SAT scores and athletic talent.
There are many things that we do not know about
Munk's candidacy for admission, and because of this
ignorance, we have no real choice but to accept Fet
ter's decision that there was another applicant out
there with better qualifications than Munk.
Fetter's decision was a brave one. No one would
have thrown a fit if she had let Munk in, and Stanford's
basketball team would probably have benefitted
tremendously. Instead, she did the unpopular thing:
she applied Stanford's rigorous academic standards to
athletics. We have faith that her decision was made
carefully and for a good reason.
