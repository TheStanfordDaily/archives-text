SW OPSI program
earmarked for axe
The Stanford Workshops on Politi
cal and Social Issues (SWOPSI) has
been one of the few innovative edu
cational pursuits available on the Stan
ford campus. Of those, it represented
still fewer attempts to allow under
graduates the dignity and respect of
having access to experiential learning
as well as the opportunity to teach in
areas not generally covered by
departmental programs.
Freedoms through these avenues
have been a source of great relief
from the authoritarian professorial
pulpits in which simple recall has
been the only requirement. SWOPSI
has allowed us the opportunity to ex
ercise our critical and creative skills in
ways that develop competence and
independence rather than the mere
ability to become good carbon copies
of authority figures. This refreshing
freedom has not been utilized by all
students, but it has represented a
veritable oasis for many of us who
sought to develop facets of our minds
beyond our memory banks and who
needed and craved the challenge.
Now we are told that all of the per
sonal development and intellectual
growth, as well as the self-confidence
and esteem that we obtained through
such a system, was not legitimate be
cause it was not supervised and moni
tored by Ph.D.s. The only obvious
way to correct such a situation, of
course, is to make extradepartmental
SWOPSI in the image of all
departmental programs at Stanford
i.e. fill all the positions with Ph.D.s,
make all the offerings as sterile as
departmental offerings, take away all
the opportunities for personal in
volvement and growth and make the
program as devoid of meaning as pos

sible. And to insure that there will be
no memory of the past achievement,
purpose and structure of SWOPSI,
fire all four members of the SWOPSI
staff.
Last year the Arrow report was
issued on the status and future of ex
tradepartmental programs. Many
people were stunned and angered
when SCIRE and ARLO were dis
mantled and some of their functions
allegedly maintained under the
centralized authority of the Public
Services Center. At the time,
however, we were assured that both
the spirit and structure of the
SWOPSI program was safe. After all,
every extradepartmental program
cannot be destroyed in the same year.
Yet SWOPSI was earmarked, as a
reading between the lines of the Ar
row report would indicate, to be
about as safe as France prjpr to
World War 11. The so-called restruc
turing of the Innovative Academic
Courses (lAC), which includes
SWOPSI, is in actuality a destruction
of the essence of the former program,
and further demonstrates administra
tive disdain for students and a total
lack of respect for opportunity and
diversity in their development.

Keep courts seedy
The Wilbur basketball courts are a
special place. Set amidst the rapid de
velopment and modernization of the
Stanford campus, these anachronisms
are a haven of memories of yes
teryear. Colorful tufts of grass dot the
cracked asphalt surface. Faded
boundary lines have long ago given in
to the harsh Stanford climate. And
shredded strands of net dangle
decoratively from the twisted rims.

Greats, like Fred Lopez, have
played these basketball courts.
Camaraderie and competition have
basked together in the open air. Un
fortunately, however, there is a
lurking demon trying to wreck this
historical landmark. Word has it that
there has been talk of resurfacing the
courts for the ludicrous reason of pre
venting injuries.
The veterans of Wilbur hope that
Stanford restrains itself from showing
such keen reason.

The veterans of Wilbur hope that
Stanford restrains itself from showing
such keen reason.

Spilled chemical
not safe to drink
I'm writing to correct a minor error
(oiumy part), that.,appear^ <
report «about a chemicaj
fer II (Daily, Mar. 5). In the article, I
was quoted (accurately) as saying
"Methylene chloride you can drink —
methyl chloride is slightly
poisonous." The reporter had no way
of knowing that I was exaggerating to
make a point. Methylene chloride is
not safe to drink, though it is non
poisonous in small doses. It had been
used as a major ingredient in the in
dustrial process for decaffeination of
coffee until its recent identification
as a possible carcinogen by the Food
and Drug Administration, a conclu
sion that has generated some contro
versy. In any case, the amount spilled
represented no health hazard of any
kind, which was the point I was trymg
to make, however clumsily.
But remember, boys and girls, this
sort of thing should not be tried at

SW OPSI program
earmarked for axe
The Stanford Workshops on Politi
cal and Social Issues (SWOPSI) has
been one of the few innovative edu
cational pursuits available on the Stan
ford campus. Of those, it represented
still fewer attempts to allow under
graduates the dignity and respect of
having access to experiential learning
as well as the opportunity to teach in
areas not generally covered by
departmental programs.
Freedoms through these avenues
have been a source of great relief
from the authoritarian professorial
pulpits in which simple recall has
been the only requirement. SWOPSI
has allowed us the opportunity to ex
ercise our critical and creative skills in
ways that develop competence and
independence rather than the mere
ability to become good carbon copies
of authority figures. This refreshing
freedom has not been utilized by all
students, but it has represented a
veritable oasis for many of us who
sought to develop facets of our minds
beyond our memory banks and who
needed and craved the challenge.
Now we are told that all of the per
sonal development and intellectual
growth, as well as the self-confidence
and esteem that we obtained through
such a system, was not legitimate be
cause it was not supervised and moni
tored by Ph.D.s. The only obvious
way to correct such a situation, of
course, is to make extradepartmental
SWOPSI in the image of all
departmental programs at Stanford
i.e. fill all the positions with Ph.D.s,
make all the offerings as sterile as
departmental offerings, take away all
the opportunities for personal in
volvement and growth and make the
program as devoid of meaning as pos

sible. And to insure that there will be
no memory of the past achievement,
purpose and structure of SWOPSI,
fire all four members of the SWOPSI
staff.
Last year the Arrow report was
issued on the status and future of ex
tradepartmental programs. Many
people were stunned and angered
when SCIRE and ARLO were dis
mantled and some of their functions
allegedly maintained under the
centralized authority of the Public
Services Center. At the time,
however, we were assured that both
the spirit and structure of the
SWOPSI program was safe. After all,
every extradepartmental program
cannot be destroyed in the same year.
Yet SWOPSI was earmarked, as a
reading between the lines of the Ar
row report would indicate, to be
about as safe as France prjpr to
World War 11. The so-called restruc
turing of the Innovative Academic
Courses (lAC), which includes
SWOPSI, is in actuality a destruction
of the essence of the former program,
and further demonstrates administra
tive disdain for students and a total
lack of respect for opportunity and
diversity in their development.

Keep courts seedy
The Wilbur basketball courts are a
special place. Set amidst the rapid de
velopment and modernization of the
Stanford campus, these anachronisms
are a haven of memories of yes
teryear. Colorful tufts of grass dot the
cracked asphalt surface. Faded
boundary lines have long ago given in
to the harsh Stanford climate. And
shredded strands of net dangle
decoratively from the twisted rims.

Greats, like Fred Lopez, have
played these basketball courts.
Camaraderie and competition have
basked together in the open air. Un
fortunately, however, there is a
lurking demon trying to wreck this
historical landmark. Word has it that
there has been talk of resurfacing the
courts for the ludicrous reason of pre
venting injuries.
The veterans of Wilbur hope that
Stanford restrains itself from showing
such keen reason.
