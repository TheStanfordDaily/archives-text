## El Salvador abuses continue unabated 
### 
Contrary to frequent official claims,
the war in El Salvador is definitely not wind
ing down. Nor are the numerous human rights vio
lations and injustices in that country diminishing.
In fact, the situation in El Salvador has actually
worsened as the United States continues to expand
the repressive capacity of the Salvadoran military
and enlarge its own role in the six-year-old war.

Let us do away with the myth that there is no
more death squad activity in El Salvador. Figures
compiled by the Roman Catholic Church show a
more than two-fold increase in death squad activity
from the second half of 1984 to the first six months
of 1985.
Far more alarming than the increase in death
squad activity, however, is the Salvadoran govern
ment's new U.S.-devised strategy for combating
the leftist opposition. The Salvadoran air force,
consisting of U.S. helicopters and gunships, osten
sibly employs aerial bombing and strafing to erad
icate insurgents in the countryside. However,
bombed-out villages and thousands of non
combatant deaths testify to the fact that the mili
tary deliberately targets civilians in order to
remove them, either through death or flight to
refugee camps, as support for the guerrillas.
The effects of the air war on the civilian popula
tion, have been devastating. Tutela Legal, the
human rights office of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of El Salvador, attributed 2.600

deaths to indiscriminate violence by the army in
1984.
Yet the important point here is that the United
States has played an integral role in these war ef
forts. The United States provides assistance to the
Salvadoran military most obviously throught finan
cial support, which during the years from 1980-
1984 totaled more than $ 1.3 billion, making El Sal
vador the largest Central American recipient of
U.S. aid. A second type of U.S. assistance is the
training it administers to Salvadoran troops in El
Salvador, Honduras and the United States.
The third and perhaps most shocking component
of U.S. assistance is its direct involvement in gath
ering surveillance information for the Salvadoran
military. From Palmerola Air Base in Honduras, a
dozen OV-1 planes are flown daily over El Sal
vador by U.S. pilots. Using infrared detectors, these
planes locate groups of people and report the infor
mation to Salvadoran forces.
Many have charged that there is a fourth compo
nent of U.S. involvement: direct combat involve
ment on the part of U.S. servicemen. U.S. person
nel have been accused of both directing air strikes
and flying missions in El Salvador.
Even in face of seemingly insuperable U.S. di
rected and supported air war tactics, the guerrillas
continue to maintain stiff resistance by virtue of a
simple change of strategy. Whereas the guerrillas
previously operated in battalions often numbering
in the hundreds and fought major army deploy
ments head-on, the rebels are now breaking up into
units of 10 to 15 which are more difficult to detect,
more easily supported in the field and less costly if
actuallv detected and attacked.

The new strategy of the rebel FMLN will most
probably prevent a quick military conclusion to the
war by either side, with the guerrillas being too dis
persed to mount a wholesale insurrection against
the government, and with the Salvadoran military,
on the other hand, finding it very difficult to elimi
nate a widespread and elusive guerrilla movement
numbering between 9,000 and 10,000 persons.
Thus, the civil war in El Salvador remains locked
in an excruciating stalemate. The United States,
which is constantly heightening its role in the war,
intensifies the suffering of the Salvadoran people
by participating in a continual barrage of human
rights violations.
Yet what is more ridiculous, or infuriating, is the
fact that U.S. involvement has apparently not
helped to bring the civil war any closer to a conclu
sion. The guerrillas' determination and their ability
to adapt to new combat strategies seem to render a
triumph by the government unlikely. Despite all
this, the Reagan Administration continues to
singlemindedly pursue a military victory.
The U.S. public, which finances Administration
policies, should seek a solution to this war which
clearly will not end on its own. Perhaps the best
course is one that has already been suggested:
negotiations, an option that has been repeatedly of
fered by the FMLN. Only negotiations, including
an adequate treatment of the social roots of the
revolution — poverty, malnutrition, unemploy
ment, poor health conditions, tremendous in
equities in the distribution of land and wealth —
will permit a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
