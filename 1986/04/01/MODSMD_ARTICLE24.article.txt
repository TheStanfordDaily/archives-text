# Enforce teacher competence
## 
### 
More than 200,000 teachers in Texas were recently
given a competency exam in basic language skills as part
of a broad program to improve public education through
out the state. Failure could result in forfeiture of their
teaching positions. The only other states which mandate
competency exams are Arkansas, which requires a math,
reading and writing exam, and Georgia, which tests for
knowledge in specific subjects being taught. It is refresh
ing that all three states are in the South, which has tradi
tionally ranked public education on a level with Republi
can candidates, civil rights and snowmobiling as major
priorities.

The competency exams have not gone unchallenged.
Many claim that written tests do not adequately measure a
teacher's performance in the classroom. Some have
declared the tests are discriminatory to minorities — a
familiar, übiquitous cry that today accompanies any at
tempt at societal change.
Competency exams are not by themselves a useful
method for improving our educational system, nor are
I: they an effective tool for measuring the quality of an indi
vidual teacher. As; hq^e gratifying
See them get a taste of ulelr own medicine. The one neces
sary and useful purpose of these exams is to weed out the
small percentage of teachers who lack the basic reading,
writing or math skills required to teach their respective
subjects.
These competency exams should not be difficult, cer
tainly not as demanding as the Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT) that students must take to enter college. The SAT
is designed to rank the nation's students by per
centile. Teacher competency exams should be designed to
determine whether a teacher does or does not meet the
absolute minimum standards to be in a classroom.
Teaching is a multi-faceted skill that cannot be quan
tified by a written examination. Teaching involves inspir
ing, motivating and challenging a student. A teacher is a
communicator who must make dull subjects appear inter
esting and must reduce complex concepts to their simplest
palatable form. Teachers must be sensitive to student dif
ficulties, they must be aware of relative abilities and able
to probe for understanding. Teaching includes establish
ing rapport, answering questions in a manner that neither
demeans nor humiliates, testing the most important con
cepts and evaluating student performance in a fair and un
biased manner. A teacher should be evaluated on class
preparation, course administration, quality of presenta
tion and professional development in his area of expertise.
Since a competency exam could never measure these fac
tors, it must be restricted to the minimum basic skills re
quired of all teachers. Peer ratings, supervisor observa

tion, student evaluations, professional credentials, sup
port of student activities or parent critiques should be
employed for a complete evaluation.
What should happen to teachers who fail the basic skill
competency exam? Upon initial failure, they should be
given the option of resigning or enrolling in a remedial 1
program on their own time at their own expense and •
retaking the test the following year. A second failure
should result in dismissal.
Since any such program is considered punitive, it '
should be accompanied by an incentive provision that .
recognizes and rewards outstanding teachers. Since there
are many aspects to superior teaching and various meth- •
ods of evaluating them, each county school budget should
have funds set aside to honor outstanding teachers. The
funds should be allocated by the type and size of school -
with each school district locally determining the criteria to
be evaluated. Teacher bonuses should be accompanied by
plaques at an awards banquet and local media coverage. -
What makes all of this necessary? Is it really important '
to have good teachers? Isn't it actually a character build
ing experience for children to suffer through a really rot- .
ten teacher and have to learn a subject on their own?
Quality teachers are very necessary when you consider •
that in a given year, a teacher may spend more time with I
and provide more influence to a given child than a parent. •
Multiply that by 30 students in a class and witness an ♦
awesome responsibility. Conduct in a classroom is usually J
observed only by the teacher and the students. Rarely in ♦
any profession does one individual have so much power !
over such a vulnerable and impressionable group. Teach- *
ers control where a child will sit, when he may speak and «
whether he will be allowed to go to the bathroom. Since J
for/ cot- l
porate executives, scientists and humanitarians of the next .
generation, it is essential to eliminate those who do not '
belong and reward those who contribute the most.
One perplexing question remains. Why aren't state
legislatures mandating competency exams for lawyers, 1
doctors and engineers? All are professions whose respon- !
sibilities and duties are comparable to those of school teach- J'
ers. The answer lies in pay scale. The engineering, law »,
and medical professions offer lucrative salaries which at- I
tract the most qualified people. These professions can af- *
ford to set stringent certification requirements and be •
assured that a sufficient number will qualify. With strict *
entrance requirements such as passing the bar or obtain- •
ing professional registration, there is much less need to »
check up later on.
Teacher salaries are a pittance in comparison. If we pay *,
teachers the same as we do garbagemen, how do we ex- I
pect to attract people who will seek advanced education,
inspire others and challenge the leadership of the next
generation? While competency exams are necessary at the
present time, they are addressing a symptom rather than *
the cause. Any state that is seriously intent upon improv- \
ing its educational system will upgrade the pay scale for t;
teachers, which will allow more stringent entrance criteria '■
and provide more qualified teachers. The basic tenet
remains — you get what you pay for.
