## Batsmen face Gators 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Spring break is over, but today the Stanford
baseball team will take a vacation from its de
manding Pac-10 schedule, traveling to San
Francisco State to face the Gators in a 2:30 p.m.
non-league game.
The Cardinal deserves a break. Shaking an
early-season trend of inconsistency, Stanford
has played splendidly in league action, surpris
ing many observers by vaulting to first place in
the Pacific-10 Southern Division with a 7-3
record.
Leading the way is sophomore pitcher Jack
McDowell, who has recorded four complete
game wins and a 1.25 ERA against Pac-10 op
ponents. McDowell's season record stands at
eight wins and one loss. The lanky righthander
has recorded 41 strikeouts in Pac-10 games and
77 on the season.
The Cardinal pitching staff as a whole has ex
celled against Pac-10 hitters. The staff has a
combined ERA of 2.43.
Stanford's hitting has also picked up during
league play. Although power is still lacking (the
team went through 10 games without a single
home run before Toi Cook ripped a grand slam

on Saturday), the Cardinal has compiled a team
batting average of .287 in Pac-10 play
(compared to .227 for their league opponents).
Several Cardinal batsmen stand out. Catcher
John Ramos leads the pack with a .410 average,
seven runs batted in and four stolen bases.
Close behind are first baseman Doug Robbins
at .393, rightfielder Cook (.326 with nine RBI),
and leftfielder Walt Harris (.316).
Both Robbins and Harris curently hold five
game hitting streaks, and Harris is especially
hot, collecting eight hits, three doubles and five
runs in last weekend's three-game series at
Arizona State.
Not to be outdone, Ramos has a 10-game hit
ting streak going and has hit safely in 15 of the
last 16 games, with two hits in each of the last
four games.
The Cardinal is 14-6 against non-league op
ponents this year. Stanford last faced San Fran
cico State in May 1985, with the Cardinal
drowning the Gators 15-0.
This afternoon's game will be a tune-up for
the Cardinal's upcoming three-game series at
UCLA. The Bruins are currently lurking in
second place in the Pac-10 Southern Division,
only a game behind Stanford. That series opens
this Friday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson
Stadium.
