# Marcos named Hoover fellow
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Ousted Philippines President Fer
dinand Marcos, responding to an in
vitation yesterday from the Hoover
Institution, has accepted an honorary
residing post at the conservative think
tank.
He will also have the title of Stan
ford acting associate professor and
will teach a graduate political science
colloquium on "Myths of Popular
Government."
Marcos, whose efforts to find sanc
tuary outside the Philippines had un
til yesterday been troublesome, ex
pressed great relief last night,
remarking, "The Hoover fellows
have made me feel welcome. Finally,
I'm among friends in the United
States."
The Daily reached Marcos by
phone at the home of University
President Donald Kennedy, where
the deposed leader and his wife, Im
melda, will be staying until they com
plete negotiations on their purchase
of a $2.7 million home in Atherton.
Meanwhile, Stanford and Santa Clara
police are maintaining a 24-hour vigil
at Kennedy's home and have blocked
many Old Campus roads to all but
faculty residents and personal atten
dants of Mrs. Marcos.

Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell yesterday expressed en
thusiasm at the prospect of Marcos
"having a chance finally to speak his
mind" as a Hoover fellow. Campbell
noted that the ex-president's political
slant had nothing to do with the invi
tation from Hoover. "We're not a po
litical entity," he said.
The Hoover director added that
out of deference to the former presi
dent he was considering giving
Marcos his prized parking spot by
Hoover Tower and parking his own
vehicle in a more distant "C" lot
along with other Stanford faculty.
Some faculty members have
denounced Hoover's invitation to
Marcos.
"Campbell must be joking," Politi
cal Science Prof. John Manley told
The Daily last night. "This is ab
solutely beyond belief."
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, who
has circulated a petition opposing the
Marcos invitation, said he is
"outraged and sickened."
"This really is the last straw," he
said yesterday. "Ferdinand Marcos
has no place at Stanford University,
no place at Hoover."
Marcos, responding to the strong
denunciation, said last night, "I have
been invited and I have accepted.
Rebholz is being unfair. The quality
of mercy is not strained."
