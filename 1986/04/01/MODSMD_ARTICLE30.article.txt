# 49ers next for Card
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Ever hurry through your dinner so you
could get to the dessert? And Mom told you
to slow down — or else she wouldn't give
you any double chocolate chip mint cake and
ice cream?
Well, the Stanford men's tennis team has a
chance to pick up a couple of sweet victories
this weekend when the netters from UCLA
and USC visit the Cardinal stomping
grounds. But hold on just a minute.
Busting the Bruins and Trojans just won't
be as tasty unless Stanford first cleans its
plate of the Long Beach State 49ers at 1:30
this afternoon at the Varsity Courts.
That task may not be too easy.
"We are not so good that we can be
looking past Long Beach at USC and
UCLA," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said
yesterday at practice. "They're (Long
Beach) a notch above the Arizona teams, but
other than that I don't know that much about
them."
Long Beach State has hovered around the
second 10 all season and is currently ranked
16th. Freshman European import Richard
Bergh is the No. 1 player for the 49ers, and is

currently ranked 10th in the nation.
Bergh, who is from Karlskoga, Sweden
and has been ranked as high as seventh this
year, will probably meet Stanford's Dan
Goldie, who is ranked second in the latest
computer rankings.
Goldie is coming off two brisk victories at
Arizona State and Arizona this past
weekend. The senior gave up a total of only
five game in the two matches in the Grand
Canyon State.
The No. 2 singles match will most likely pit
two players who are nowhere to be found in
the top 100 rankings, but probably should be
somewhere in the upper echelon. Both Jim
Grabb of Stanford and Peter Smith of Long
Beach haven't played that many matches so
far this year. Since the rankings are compiled
by a computer and are based on match
results, neither man is rejpognized in the
standings. *
Long Beach Coach Larry Easley will also
bring No. 69 Craig Miller No. 98 Greg
Failla to join Bergh and Smith in the heart of
the lineup.
These 49ers could be strong enough to
give Stanford some indigestion.
"I'm expecting a good tough match,"
Gould said.
