# Kiwi Mosse flies to fame
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Easily distinguished by his poise, ed
ucated self-confidence and smooth accent,
sophomore swimmer Anthony Mosse denies
any connection with Australia and koala
bears. But ask him about Kiwis and he has
much to tell about his homeland New
Zealand.
Foreign Stanford student and Cardinal
swimmer Mosse has climbed from local hero
status in that narrow island "down under" to
capture world interest and establish global
ranking as one of top butterfliers in the
water today. And at 21 years old, he shows
no signs of migrating from the pool. He's in
the midst of a promising metamorphosis.
Born in Hong Kong, Mosse was moved by
his New Zealand-native parents, Peter and
Joy, along with his brother Adrien back to
Auckland, New Zealand at the age of 12.
He attended boarding school at King's
College, where he put his natural athletic
ability to use in tennis, cricket and rugby. He

didn't start swimming until he was 15, but
his coaches immediately recognized butter
fly agility and talent.
Mosse swam with the New Zealand
Amateur Swim Association, which took him
all over the world from Europe and
Australia to the Philippines. The teenager
caught the eye of swimming fans
everywhere.
He continued to excel under the coaching
of Hisashi Inomata up through the 1984
Summer Olympics. In his first visit to the
United States, Mosse placed fifth in the 200
butterfly and sixth in the 100 fly at the Los
Angeles Games to break New Zealand
records in both events.
"That was a very exciting experience,"
Mosse said. "I learned a lot. I learned that
I'm swimming for myself now, not for
coaches or parents or the press. The bottom
line of all my training is that I'm doing it for
me."
And with that revelation, he confirmed
his interest in the 1988 Olympics. He said,
"That's one of the main reasons why I

decided to come to school from 1984-
1988."
In choosing a college education, Mosse
decided to return to the States because New
Zealand university sports are virtually non
existent. He chose to attend Stanford and
swim under Coach Skip Kenney for several
reasons.
"I wanted to swim and study. I didn't
want to become a swimming vegetable," he
explained. "The people and academics at
Stanford really impressed me."
On his recruiting trip here, Mosse fell in
love with the location of Stanford and the
beauty of the campus. "The foothills in back
reminded me of home," he said.
Kenney was pleased with Mosse's interest
in Stanford because, "He was one of the top
recruits in the world. He had low mileage
and did high quality yardage work in his pre
vious training," Kenney said. He also ac
knowledged that Stanford offered what
Mosse desired, "a challenge in the class-
