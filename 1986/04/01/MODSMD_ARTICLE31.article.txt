# Kiwi Mosse flies to fame
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
Easily distinguished by his poise, ed
ucated self-confidence and smooth accent,
sophomore swimmer Anthony Mosse denies
any connection with Australia and koala
bears. But ask him about Kiwis and he has
much to tell about his homeland New
Zealand.
Foreign Stanford student and Cardinal
swimmer Mosse has climbed from local hero
status in that narrow island "down under" to
capture world interest and establish global
ranking as one of top butterfliers in the
water today. And at 21 years old, he shows
no signs of migrating from the pool. He's in
the midst of a promising metamorphosis.
Born in Hong Kong, Mosse was moved by
his New Zealand-native parents, Peter and
Joy, along with his brother Adrien back to
Auckland, New Zealand at the age of 12.
He attended boarding school at King's
College, where he put his natural athletic
ability to use in tennis, cricket and rugby. He

didn't start swimming until he was 15, but
his coaches immediately recognized butter
fly agility and talent.
Mosse swam with the New Zealand
Amateur Swim Association, which took him
all over the world from Europe and
Australia to the Philippines. The teenager
caught the eye of swimming fans
everywhere.
He continued to excel under the coaching
of Hisashi Inomata up through the 1984
Summer Olympics. In his first visit to the
United States, Mosse placed fifth in the 200
butterfly and sixth in the 100 fly at the Los
Angeles Games to break New Zealand
records in both events.
"That was a very exciting experience,"
Mosse said. "I learned a lot. I learned that
I'm swimming for myself now, not for
coaches or parents or the press. The bottom
line of all my training is that I'm doing it for
me."
And with that revelation, he confirmed
his interest in the 1988 Olympics. He said,
"That's one of the main reasons why I

decided to come to school from 1984-
1988."
In choosing a college education, Mosse
decided to return to the States because New
Zealand university sports are virtually non
existent. He chose to attend Stanford and
swim under Coach Skip Kenney for several
reasons.
"I wanted to swim and study. I didn't
want to become a swimming vegetable," he
explained. "The people and academics at
Stanford really impressed me."
On his recruiting trip here, Mosse fell in
love with the location of Stanford and the
beauty of the campus. "The foothills in back
reminded me of home," he said.
Kenney was pleased with Mosse's interest
in Stanford because, "He was one of the top
recruits in the world. He had low mileage
and did high quality yardage work in his pre
vious training," Kenney said. He also ac
knowledged that Stanford offered what
Mosse desired, "a challenge in the class-

top swimmers in only his second season on the Farm and

room as well as in the pool."
In the classroom, Mosse is chal
lenged by Stanford's prestigious
academics.
In the pool, Mosse's main conten
tion is teammate Pablo Morales.
Mosse first met Morales at the
1984 Olympics where Morales inched
by him in each of their races. Morales
holds the best Stanford time in both
of Mosse's events, the 100 butterfly
(47.02) and the 200 butterfly
(1:42.85). Morales set both records
at the 1985 NCAA Championships.
But instead of being intimidated by
Morales' accomplishments, Mosse
welcomes the competition. "I knew
what I was getting into," Mosse said.
"He's an incentive to do better and
perform well."
When asked about a rivalry be
tween the two butterfliers, Kenney
denied any tension. "Pablo and An
thony have no problems working to
gether. Their closeness, caring and
respect for each other has added a lot
to the team and has shown the other
swimmers how to get along with and

benefit from competition."
Respect is key in their relationship
which culminates in scoring points for
the Stanford squad. "We have a lot of
mutual respect for each other which
helps us push each other in races to
do the best for ourselves and the
team," Morales said.
With the approach of the 1986
NCAAs, which take place this week
in Indianapolis, Mosse reflected on
last year's championships. "1 gained
so much experience," he said. "I've
changed a lot since then. I've im
proved." In 1985 he placed third in
the 200 butterfly and seventh in the
100 butterfly.
He began the 1985-86 swim season
just short of healthy. He was bur
dened by a case of chicken pox which
kept him from the pool for quite a
while. But the pace picked up in Jan
uary when Mosse traveled to
Australia and swam in the
Queensland State Championships.
The trip turned out to be more than
worthwhile. He won the 200 butterfly,
beating John Sieben, the top ranked
butterflier in the world, and stealing
Sieben's spot at the top. Mosse also
took second in the 100 butterfly.
Mosse has three big meets on his

mind for 1986. They are the NCAAs,
the Commonwealth Games in Scot
land and the World Championships in
Spain. But most pressing are
Thursday's NCAAs which he is pre
paring for now.
After competing in last year's
NCAAs, Mosse said he feels that this
weekend "won't be as much of a
surprise as last year. I hope to control
myself more. I'm ready."
Mosse is also confident of the
team's chances after its 1985 victory.
"We have the swimmers and the
coaches, and our chemistry is most
important. We have outstanding indi
viduals who can work well as a team,"
he said.
Kenney characteristically expects
good things from Mosse in In
dianapolis. He predicted that, "The
No. 1 and No. 2 positions will be a
toss up between Anthony and Pablo
in the butterfly."
As Mosse steadily improves his
times, he has perfected his turns, but
he admits that the area most in need
of improvement is his speed. And the
weight room is the best place to build
up his slender physique to cultivate
more explosive speed.
Kenney agrees, "He can be a better

swimmer with more power work. His
times continue to get lower and
lower."
With Mosse being an irreplaceable
cog in the Stanford swimming ma
chine, Kenney most values the Kiwi's
leadership skills and coachability.
"He's so coachable and so hungry,
and he really communicates well.
He's very self-motivated and his atti
tude is his greatest potential," Ken
ney said.
Teammate Jeff Kostoff elaborated
on Mosse's attitude: "You know you
can depend on Anthony.
Out of the pool and dried off,
Mosse studies political science, eco
nomics and industrial engineering.
He is in the midst of designing his
own major in a related combination
of the three fields. But when the
books are closed, Mosse heads right
back to the water to enjoy windsurf
ing and beach bumming. Plus, he's
currently working to obtain a private
pilot's license. "I only have ten more
hours in the air until I get it,"he said.
Upon graduation, Mosse would
like to stay in the United States and
work in a field pertaining to his
major, or perhaps return to the
Orient.

water today. And at 21 years old, he shows
no signs of migrating from the pool. He's in
the midst of a promising metamorphosis.
Born in Hong Kong, Mosse was moved by
his New Zealand-native parents, Peter and
Joy, along with his brother Adrien back to
Auckland, New Zealand at the age of 12.
He attended boarding school at King's
College, where he put his natural athletic
ability to use in tennis, cricket and rugby. He

didn't start swimming until he was 15, but
his coaches immediately recognized butter
fly agility and talent.
Mosse swam with the New Zealand
Amateur Swim Association, which took him
all over the world from Europe and
Australia to the Philippines. The teenager
caught the eye of swimming fans
everywhere.
He continued to excel under the coaching
of Hisashi Inomata up through the 1984
Summer Olympics. In his first visit to the
United States, Mosse placed fifth in the 200
butterfly and sixth in the 100 fly at the Los
Angeles Games to break New Zealand
records in both events.
"That was a very exciting experience,"
Mosse said. "I learned a lot. I learned that
I'm swimming for myself now, not for
coaches or parents or the press. The bottom
line of all my training is that I'm doing it for
me."
And with that revelation, he confirmed
his interest in the 1988 Olympics. He said,
"That's one of the main reasons why I

decided to come to school from 1984-
1988."
In choosing a college education, Mosse
decided to return to the States because New
Zealand university sports are virtually non
existent. He chose to attend Stanford and
swim under Coach Skip Kenney for several
reasons.
"I wanted to swim and study. I didn't
want to become a swimming vegetable," he
explained. "The people and academics at
Stanford really impressed me."
On his recruiting trip here, Mosse fell in
love with the location of Stanford and the
beauty of the campus. "The foothills in back
reminded me of home," he said.
Kenney was pleased with Mosse's interest
in Stanford because, "He was one of the top
recruits in the world. He had low mileage
and did high quality yardage work in his pre
vious training," Kenney said. He also ac
knowledged that Stanford offered what
Mosse desired, "a challenge in the class-

room as well as in the pool."
In the classroom, Mosse is chal
lenged by Stanford's prestigious
academics.
In the pool, Mosse's main conten
tion is teammate Pablo Morales.
Mosse first met Morales at the
1984 Olympics where Morales inched
by him in each of their races. Morales
holds the best Stanford time in both
of Mosse's events, the 100 butterfly
(47.02) and the 200 butterfly
(1:42.85). Morales set both records
at the 1985 NCAA Championships.
But instead of being intimidated by
Morales' accomplishments, Mosse
welcomes the competition. "I knew
what I was getting into," Mosse said.
"He's an incentive to do better and
perform well."
When asked about a rivalry be
tween the two butterfliers, Kenney
denied any tension. "Pablo and An
thony have no problems working to
gether. Their closeness, caring and
respect for each other has added a lot
to the team and has shown the other
swimmers how to get along with and

benefit from competition."
Respect is key in their relationship
which culminates in scoring points for
the Stanford squad. "We have a lot of
mutual respect for each other which
helps us push each other in races to
do the best for ourselves and the
team," Morales said.
With the approach of the 1986
NCAAs, which take place this week
in Indianapolis, Mosse reflected on
last year's championships. "1 gained
so much experience," he said. "I've
changed a lot since then. I've im
proved." In 1985 he placed third in
the 200 butterfly and seventh in the
100 butterfly.
He began the 1985-86 swim season
just short of healthy. He was bur
dened by a case of chicken pox which
kept him from the pool for quite a
while. But the pace picked up in Jan
uary when Mosse traveled to
Australia and swam in the
Queensland State Championships.
The trip turned out to be more than
worthwhile. He won the 200 butterfly,
beating John Sieben, the top ranked
butterflier in the world, and stealing
Sieben's spot at the top. Mosse also
took second in the 100 butterfly.
Mosse has three big meets on his

mind for 1986. They are the NCAAs,
the Commonwealth Games in Scot
land and the World Championships in
Spain. But most pressing are
Thursday's NCAAs which he is pre
paring for now.
After competing in last year's
NCAAs, Mosse said he feels that this
weekend "won't be as much of a
surprise as last year. I hope to control
myself more. I'm ready."
Mosse is also confident of the
team's chances after its 1985 victory.
"We have the swimmers and the
coaches, and our chemistry is most
important. We have outstanding indi
viduals who can work well as a team,"
he said.
Kenney characteristically expects
good things from Mosse in In
dianapolis. He predicted that, "The
No. 1 and No. 2 positions will be a
toss up between Anthony and Pablo
in the butterfly."
As Mosse steadily improves his
times, he has perfected his turns, but
he admits that the area most in need
of improvement is his speed. And the
weight room is the best place to build
up his slender physique to cultivate
more explosive speed.
Kenney agrees, "He can be a better

swimmer with more power work. His
times continue to get lower and
lower."
With Mosse being an irreplaceable
cog in the Stanford swimming ma
chine, Kenney most values the Kiwi's
leadership skills and coachability.
"He's so coachable and so hungry,
and he really communicates well.
He's very self-motivated and his atti
tude is his greatest potential," Ken
ney said.
Teammate Jeff Kostoff elaborated
on Mosse's attitude: "You know you
can depend on Anthony.
Out of the pool and dried off,
Mosse studies political science, eco
nomics and industrial engineering.
He is in the midst of designing his
own major in a related combination
of the three fields. But when the
books are closed, Mosse heads right
back to the water to enjoy windsurf
ing and beach bumming. Plus, he's
currently working to obtain a private
pilot's license. "I only have ten more
hours in the air until I get it,"he said.
Upon graduation, Mosse would
like to stay in the United States and
work in a field pertaining to his
major, or perhaps return to the
Orient.

ucated self-confidence and smooth accent,
sophomore swimmer Anthony Mosse denies
any connection with Australia and koala
bears. But ask him about Kiwis and he has
much to tell about his homeland New
Zealand.
Foreign Stanford student and Cardinal
swimmer Mosse has climbed from local hero
status in that narrow island "down under" to
capture world interest and establish global
ranking as one of top butterfliers in the

no signs of migrating from the pool. He's in
