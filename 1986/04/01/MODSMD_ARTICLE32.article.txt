DALLAS (AP) â€” Freshman
Pervis Ellison lived up lo his
nickname of "Never Nervous," and it
paid off in Louisville's second NCAA
basketball championship in six years
last night.
Ellison, a ft-foot-9 center, took
over inside, scoring 25 points and
pulling in 1 I rebounds as he led No. 7
Louisville to a 72-69 victory over
top-ranked Duke. He was named the
Most Outstanding Player in the Final
Four, the first freshman so honored
since Utah's Amie Ferrin in IIM4.l l M4.
"That's why we call him 'Never
Nervous Pervis," " sophomore
teammate Herbert Crook said.
"Down at the end, when we need
rebounds, he gets them."
He did, scoring eight of the Car
dinals' last 15 points and gathering
two key rebounds that spoiled Duke's
hopes of capping a record season with
its first national crown.
The victory was the 1 7th straight
for Louisville, which finished at 32-7.
And it broke the 21-game winning
streak of the Blue Devils, who
finished 37-3, the most victories in a
season in NCAA history.
Louisville needed everything El
lison could give to overcome a stellar
performance by Duke's Ail-
American guard Johnny Dawkins,
who finished with 24 points. But
strangely, Dawkins could not seem to

get the ball in the final minutes.
Louisville was leading 66-65 with
4N seconds to play and the clock run
ning down when guard Jeff Hall
missed a short jumper. Ellison
grabbed the rebound and put it back
in and the C ardinals had a three
point lead with only 41 seconds left.
"I saw the shot was falling short,"
Ellison said. "1 got past everybody
and laid it in."
Ellison assured the victory with 27
seconds left when he rebounded a
missed shot by Duke's David Hen
derson, was fouled by Mark Alarie
and sank two free throws to make it
70-65.
After Duke scored on rebounds by
Jay Bilas and Danny Ferry. Louisville
guard Milt Wagner sealed it with two
free throws with two seconds remain
ing.
"I thought he made some great
athletic moves around the basket and
that did surprise me. He is a great of
fensive player," Alarie said.
Duke's guards outscored Louis
ville's 35-13, Wagner not getting his
first field goal until there was 5:33
left in the game. That came on a
fastbreak set up by an Ellison blocked
shot.
Louisville's front line outscored
Duke's 48-30, but more importantly,
Louisville outrebounded Duke 39-
27, with Crook getting 12.
