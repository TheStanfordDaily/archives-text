## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Playing against what Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf called the toughest
field thus far this season, the Stafford
men's golf team finished tied for 14th
in the Henry Homburg Invitational,
which ended Sunday in Beaumont,
Texas.
Oklahoma State, with a three-day
total of 849, topped the competition,
which included seven of the nation's
top 10 teams.
Houston and Florida finished tied
for second, three strokes behind the
Cowboys, while Texas Christian and
Louisiana State were deadlocked in
tourth place at 857.
The one thing one might say about
the Cardinal is that it was consistent.
Stanford shot 295 on Friday, and 296
on both Saturday and Sunday, to
leave it tied with Oral Roberts Uni
versity at 887, 38 strokes off the pace.
But according to Schaaf, it was the
squad's lack of consistency among the
individual golfers that led to the
team's demise.

"We're missing consistency among
our lower golfers," Schaaf said yes
terday.
Rich Marik, Brad Geer and Phil
Rowley each had rounds they would
like to have over again to back up
that that point. Marik's two rounds of
74 were divided by an SO on Saturday
to raise his score to 228. Geer and
Rowley each finished at 231.
Don Walsworth, who has had an
up-and-down winter, fired a 215, one
under par on the par-72 Pinewood
Golf Course, to lead Stanford's indi
viduals. Carl Wagner was right be
hind him at 218 for the weekend.
"It is necessary to have both Don
and Carl playing well," Schaaf said.
Houston Baptist's Colin
Montgomerie led the individuals with
a 12-under-par 204. Florida's Jim
Schuman and Arizona State's Bill
Mayfiar tied for second at 207.
The Cardinal's next tournament is
the U.S. Intercollegiate, April 12-13
at Stanford.
"We're not really tournament
tough," Schaaf said. "We have to
have everybody playing well."
