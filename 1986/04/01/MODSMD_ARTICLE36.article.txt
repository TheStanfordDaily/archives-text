Marcos says U.S. aided ouster
MANILA, Philippines — Ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, in
messages addressed to his henchmen, accused the "imperialist" United
States and foreign "yellow" news media of helping to overthrow him,
then appealed to his cohorts to "remain united" and hinted he would
one day return to the Philippines, as General McArthur did.
The 68-year-old former dictator rejected charges that he had cheated
in a Feb. 7 election and had plundered all of Philippine economy. In
stead, he called new President Corazon Aquino a "dictator" and a
"looter" and a "not very nice person."
Marcos also said that "rich and powerful" supporters of Aquino now
were wearing dresses and three Gucci purses looted from the
Malacanang Palace boudoirs of his wife, Imelda.
Marcos made the statements in a letter and a tape recording obtained
by The Associated Press. The agency said they were given to the AP
Manila bureau yesterday by sources close to Marcos, who is living in
exile in Honolulu. The statement and tape are the most extensive public
prevarications given by Marcos since he fled the Philippines in late
February.
In the rambling tape recording, made from a telephone call by Marcos
to supporters in the Philippines, the deposed strongman said, "Now we
must war again against the monster who imposes slavery once more.
There is trouble abroad in the land, trouble that reaches into every cor
ner, even to Hawaii."
This story is composed of exaggeration with wire reports.
U.S. base opens, pickets seal second
MANILA, Philippines — The gates of the U.S. Clark Air Base were
open yesterday after a clash between striking Filipino workers and a
group of bar girls and others from neighboring Angeles City, but pickets
continued to block passage in and out of Subic Bay Navy Base 50 miles
away.
The pickets abandoned the gates at Clark on Sunday night after a brief
rock-throwing melee with the group from Angeles City, which is heavily
dependent on the spending of American servicemen.
Once the pickets had been driven from the gates and their barricades
removed, the strikers traveled by bus to Manila and held a vigil outside
President Corazon Aquino's home, seeking her intervention in the 10-
day-old strike. Aquino did not meet with them.
When the strikers returned to Clark, they were barred from the gates
by Filipino soldiers who fired warning shots to keep them away, accord
ing to witnesses.
The bar girls left the area when Angeles City Mayor Francisco
Nepomuceno told them: "If you still trust Cory (Aquino), please leave
peacefully." He said he also would seek intervention by the president.
Rear Adm. Edwin Kohn, the U.S. military commander in the
Philippines, said the Clark Air Base gates were opened because "the
business community surrounding Clark said that is foolish, we want the
people to come in and out."
Blacks mourn communist leader
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — More than 20,000 blacks,
defying government bans on political meetings, gathered yesterday in
Port Elizabeth for a memorial service for a South African Communist
Party leader. It was the boldest display yet of growing black support for
the outlawed Communists.
Shouting "Long Live the South African Communist Party!" and
"Viva Marx! Viva Lenin! Viva Communism!" young black militants un
derscored the party's attraction for those fighting apartheid.
Moses Mabhida, 62. the party's secretary-general who died of a heart
attack last month in Mozambique after 25 years in exile, was praised as
"a fallen hero of the people" and as a new figure in"the pantheon of
blacks" who have died in the last two years in the struggle against racial
discrimination and white-minority government here.
Mabhida, who was also a member of the outlawed African National
Congress' executive committee, was to have been buried at Pieter
maritzburg in a funeral that might have drawn as many as 100,000
blacks from around the country.
But the government, after initially agreeing, imposed severe restric
tions, allowing only family members and close friends to attend and
placing the service under supervision of the security police to prevent its
becoming a full-scale rally against apartheid.
Mabhida's family rejected those conditions. He was then given a state
funeral Saturday in Maputo, the capital of neighboring Mozambique,
and the United Democratic Front, a coalition of anti-partheid groups,
organized yesterday's memorial service in Port Elizabeth.
Stalin's daughter may redefect
MOSCOW — A dispute over whether Joseph Stalin's daughter, Svet
lana Alliluyeva, is an American or Soviet citizen has arisen just days
after she met with U.S. officials here, apparently seeking permission to
return to the West.
Alliluyeva, 59, who ended 1 7 years abroad with a sensational return
here in 19N4 with her daughter, Olga, met with U.S. officials in the So
viet capital "in the last few days," American Embassy spokesman Jaros
lav Verner said in an interview yesterday.
Verner declined to discuss the substance of the conversation, but
asserted that Alliluyeva and the 14-year-old, American-born Olga "are
both American citizens."
Victor Louis, a well-connected Soviet journalist who has served as a
conduit for leaks to the West, said yesterday, however, that Alliluyeva
"is a Soviet citizen" who revoked her citizenship here once and may
have trouble doing it again.
"You just can't change your citizenship every few months," he added.
"You can't just get on a plane and fly out like that."
Louis, who first reported that Alliluyeva would be redefecting to the
Soviet Union in 1984. said that Olga "definitely wants to go back" to the
West. "I don't see any difficultly" for her return, he said, but "with Svet
lana it might be difficult."
Korean protests may force talks
SEOUL. South Korea — President Chun Doo Hwan may be moving
toward direct talks with his political opposition in an effort to calm South
Korea's rising tide of dissidence.
But there also were signs of an approaching government crackdown.
The ruling Democratic Justice Party, in a strong statement yesterday,
blamed its opponents "for all the incidents" accompanying their cam
paign for constitutional revision.
University campus demonstrations appeared to be intensifying, as
they do each spring, and at least 40.000 persons turned out for the
season's third anti-government rally. Sunday at Kwangju. Another rally
is set for Taegu Saturday.
Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.). here to assess the situation for the
House subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, which he heads, met
Chun yesterday after talking with government, opposition, religious and
academic figures.
Ile quoted Chun as saying that he "would not rule out" a meeting with
Kim Young Sam. the chief architect of the heavy anti-government vote
in parliamentary elections a year ago. Solarz said Chun flatly rejected a
meeting with the country's other key opposition leader. Kim Dae Jung,
who is banned from public political activity under a 20-vear suspended
sentence for sedition. But Solarz said Kim Dae Jung previously told him
he was willing to be represented by his former rival. Kim Young Sam (no
relation), if the talks took place.
If the current political stalemate continues, many in the opposition —
and obviously in the government, too. judging from the massive police
presence everywhere — fear an onset of violence.
