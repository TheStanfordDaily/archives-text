# 166 die in Mexican airline crash
## 
### 
A Mexicana Airlines Boeing 727, en route to
Los Angeles from Mexico City with Easter holiday
travelers, crashed and burned yesterday in the
mountains west of the Mexican capital after the
craft apparently lost cabin pressure and the pilot
made an emergency descent. All 166 people
aboard were reported dead.
Mexicana's flight 940, scheduled to stop at the
coastal resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan
before continuing to Los Angeles, struck a moun
tainside in the rugged Sierra Madre of central
Mexico following takeoff from Mexico City's
Benito Juarez International Airport 15 minutes
earlier.
Hours after the crash, a Mexican government
spokesman said that the wreckage of the plane was
still in flames and all aboard had died in what avia
tion officials called the worst air disaster in their
nation's history.
Local officials of the airline said that none of the
passengers on the Mexico City-Puerto Vallarta leg
of the flight were bound for Los Angeles, but
added that three Mexicana crew members based
here were aboard.
There were 158 passengers and eight crew mem
bers on the jet, airline officials in Mexico City re
ported.
Farmers in the area said that they saw the plane
explode in a ball of fire in the air before it crashed
into a mountain named El Carbon, 7,792 feet
above sea level. There was no immediate confirma

tion of those sightings by Mexican investigators.
The plane reportedly split into two sections and
debris was scattered over an area of more than half
a mile.
Mexico City air traffic controllers lost contact
with the plane about 7:15 a.m. PST, and police
helicopters soon after spotted its burning wreckage
about 80 miles northwest of Mexico City in the
state of Michoacan.
Mexicana officials reported that Capt. Carlos
Guadarrama Sistos, a veteran airlines pilot with
15,000 hours of flight time, radioed the Mexico
City air traffic control center about 10 minutes
after take off and said the plane was losing altitude.
" The captain asked for permission to descend
because they had problems about the pressuriza
tion of the plane," said airline spokesman Jose
Henonin in Mexico City. "That was the last time
they heard from the captain — when he asked for
permission to descend to 6,000 feet. He was flying
at 26,000 feet (before the apparent pressurization
problem)." Officials could offer no immediate ex
planation for the loss of cabin pressure, but
Mexican aviation experts were studying two tapes
of radio communications between the flight and
ground controllers in a search for clues to the crash.
In the ravine where the main part of the fuselage
lay, Red Cross, police and local volunteer rescue
workers continued to look for survivors but with
little hope.
Fire-blackened bodies and disembodied limbs

were scattered outside the wreckage, and the res
cuers said that more were inside.
Mexicana representatives in the Mexican capital
said that most of the passengers were Mexican
citizens, but a spokesman for the French Embassy
reported that the dead included a family of eight
French citizens — one of whom was Mexico City
businessman Javier Larpilleux, regional director
for Mexico and the United States of the interna
tional travel agency, Wagon-Lits.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Mexico
City said officials did not know if any of the victims
were U.S. citizens, but they were reviewing the
plane's passenger list with Mexican authorities.
Another U.S. Embassy official reported later that
25 "non-Spanish-sounding names" were on the
passengei manifesto.
Officials from both the embassy and the U.S.
consulate in Guadalajara were on their way to the
site late yesterday.
Easter week vacationers scheduled to return
here on the flight from Puerto Vallarta and Mazat
lan were shifted to a substitute Mexicana plane,
which arrived at Los Angeles in mid-afternoon.
The 727s have the second best safety record in
commercial airline historv (after Boeine 7375).
Wheeler said.
Cole said that Boeing officials and U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board investigators were
preparing to fly to Mexico City to assist Mexican
authorities in their investigation.
