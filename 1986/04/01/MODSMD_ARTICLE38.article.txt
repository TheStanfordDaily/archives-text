SAN FRANCISCO — A strong,
rolling earthquake and several small
aftershocks shook Northern Califor
nians awake early yesterday morning.
Injuries and damage were generally
minor, although the quake did put
out of operation a telescope at an ob
servatory 50 miles southeast of here.
Although it peaked at 5.3 on the
Richter scale and was felt as far north
as Santa Rosa, about 45 miles north
east of San Francisco, and as far south
as San Luis Obispo, 270 miles away,
the 3:55 a.m. PST temblor caused no
serious personal injury. Hospitals re
ported only a few people seeking care
for scrapes and bruises, including
some who cut their feet walking on
broken glassware.

The quake, which hit less than a
month before the 80th anniversary of
the devastating San Francisco
earthquake and fire of 1906, struck
hardest at the James Lick Obser
vatory on Mount Hamilton, about 50
miles southeast of here and just south
of the earthquake epicenter.
Ron Laub, superintendent of the
UC-Santa Cruz facility, said the
earthquake widened several existing
cracks in one building that houses the
observatory's original 36-inch refrac
tor telescope, and the building was
closed.
At the same time, he added, the
shaking cracked a number of fittings
in the hydraulic system that positions
the newer, 120-inrh That

piece of equipment was left in
operable, he said, and engineers were
called in for repairs.
Elsewhere the damage was less se
vere. Wineries near the observatory
said they suffered no damage at all. A
liquor store in Fremont, the city
nearest the epicenter, reported many
broken bottles, but other stores and
supermarkets said their wares stayed
put.
The earthquake was a puzzle to sci
entists at UC-Berkeley. Berkeley.
Prof. Bruce Bolt, director of the seis
mographic station there, said the
temblor occurred somewhere in the
San Andreas system, though not on
that well-known fault and not in the
fashion common to earthquakes in

the region.
"One of the interesting things
about it is that it doesn't seem to be
located on any known fault in the
Mount Hamilton area," he said.
"When I rushed in here this morning,
I would have sworn it was on the
Calaveras fault, but it wasn't. In fact,
it wasn't anything at all like we would
have expected from that fault."
Particularly odd, he said, was that
the earth apparently slipped vertically
during the quake, not horizontally, as
is normal in the San Andreas system.
Bolt added that yesterday's
earthquake apparently was unrelated
to another one, registering 4.0, that
shook approximately the same area
Saturday.
