Stable oil prices sought
WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary John
Herrington said yesterday that Saudi Arabia is
approaching "a point of diminishing return" in its
effort to force lower oil prices through over
production, and suggested that there will be
"political implications" if the price war contin
ues.
Department of Energy officials said the
remarks were intended as a signal to the Saudis
that the time has come to stabilize oil prices,
which have dropped more than 60 percent since
December. The precipitous plunge has played
havoc with the U.S. oil industry which must
match the world oil price, largely set by decisions
made by members of the Organization of Petro
leum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
"It's got to be apparent to the Saudis and the
rest of the Arabs that their production is causing
some problems in our producer industries," Her
rington told reporters in an informal briefing.
"There is a point where forcing prices or in
creasing production has political implications.
The Saudis have a lot of friends in the world, and
forcing prices down by excess production has
ramifications among their allies."
DOE officials said Herrington was speaking as
energy secretary, and that his remarks were not
coordinated with the White House. The Admin
istration has held steadfastly to a hands-off policy

on energy markets, a philosophy that Herrington
repeated to a Senate hearing as recently as last
week.
Court questions gay law
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, in a
new and far-ranging test of the right to privacy,
was urged yesterday to extend constitutional
protection for the first time to private
homosexual acts between consenting adults.
In oral argument, a Harvard law professor
representing a Georgia man charged with
sodomy told the justices that the Constitution
should be invoked to prevent the state from
"dictating in embarrassing detail" how adults be
have in their bedrooms.
"When government tells people how to con
duct the most intimate affairs of their lives . . .
there must be a better reason than simply the
morality of the majority," Professor Laurence
Tribe said.
But a state's attorney defended the validity of
sodomy laws and warned that extending constitu
tional protection to such conduct would invite
similar demands to protect polygamy, adultery,
consensual incest and possession of illegal drugs.
"The state of Georgia is not acting as Big
Brother," Assistant Attorney General Michael
Hobbs said. "It is adhering to centuries-old tradi
tion and the conventional morality of its people."

Aide's ethics in question
SANTA BARBARA — Former White House
deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver, now a lob
byist and consultant, recently met with James
Miller 111, director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, on behalf of a client,
Rockwell International Corp., which is trying to
convince the Administration and Congress to
build more B1 bombers.
The meeting unsettled some White House offi
cials, Administration sources said, because of
federal rules that prohibit a senior official who
leaves the government from lobbying his former
department or agency for a year. The rules also
prohibit top officials from lobbying on issues in
which they were personally and substantially in
volved while in government.
A senior White House official said that
"technically" Deaver did not violate the rule be
cause Miller, at the Office of Management and
Budget, is not part of the White House Office,
which is made up of top presidential aides such as
chief of staff Donald Regan.
