# Rosse seeks to inhabit Kennedy's mansion
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Provost James Rosse has asked the Board of
Trustees for permission to live in the Lou Henry
Hoover House during his tenure as acting presi
dent next vear.
University President Donald Kennedy, who
will hand over day-to-day control of the Uni
versity to Rosse during a winter-quarter sab
batical, has responded angrily to Rosse's pro
posal, calling it an "ad hominem attack" and an
"undue hardship" for "my wife and me."
The sprawling Hoover House is the tradi
tional home of University presidents and their
families. Rosse would be the first acting presi
dent to live in the huge white stuefco home.

Rosse will serve in Kennedy's absence from
December 1986 until March 1987. Kennedy
plans to work on long-term development issues
during his one-quarter break.
"I had hoped to live on campus during my
leave," Kennedy said in a letter to Board Presi
dent Warren Christopher, ' nut should the
board approve this request, Jeanne and I will be
forced to seek residence elsewhere."
Kennedy told The Daily yesterday that he
will soon begin looking for rental housing in
Barron Park, a small Palo Alto neighborhood
south of Stanford, so that he can be prepared to
move if the Board approves Rosse's request at
its next meeting.
"Moving would be an unnecessary distraction

in a year not entirely devoid of unnecessary dis
tractions," Kennedy said.
Rosse said he sympathizes with Kennedy's
plight, but said he has two reasons for seeking
residence in the presidential home. First, he
feels the home lends a certain prestige to the
presidency that he will need to carry out his ad
ministrative plans for the months that he will
lead Stanford. Second, he said Kennedy needs
to "get back in touch with the surrounding com
munities."
"If we force him out of his campus home, out
of the comfortable life of a university president
and into the dog-eat-dog world of life in Palo
Alto, we can bring him a better understanding
of the concerns of the greater Stanford commu

nity," Rosse said.
Rosse has asked the Board to evict Kennedy
no later than the end of summer quarter in or
der to allow the provost to redecorate the house
in time for his assumption of presidential
powers.
"Obviously, we'll have to fix the place up a
bit," Rosse said, adding that the Kennedys have
done little maintenance on the home since
Queen Elizabeth II visited the Hoover House
several years ago.
Rosse said a major redecoration effort would
have to be completed before he could move in.
"The Harvard Yard look will have to go," he
said. "I just can't take that sort of stuff
seriously."
