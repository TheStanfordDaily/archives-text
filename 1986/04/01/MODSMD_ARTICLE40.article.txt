Night stalker named
LOS ANGELES — A woman identified
"Night Stalker" defendant Richard Ramirez in
court yesterday as the man who held a gun to her
12-year-old son's head, ransacked her house,
then raped and sodomized her.
The Burbank woman, whose name was with
held, said she talked with Ramirez for about 20
minutes after the assault and recalled telling him:
"You must have had an unhappy life to do this to
me."
She testified that Ramirez asked her age, then
told her: "You look pretty good."
A 26-year-old drifter from El Paso, Texas,
Ramirez is charged in Los Angeles County with
14 murders, five attempted murders, seven rapes,
five acts of oral copulation, seven of sodomy,
three lewd acts on children, two kidnappings, 19
burglaries and six robberies.
The preliminary hearing, in its fifth week, is
being held to determine if there is sufficient
evidence to try Ramirez.
In Orange County, he is charged with eight
felony counts in the attempted murder of a Mis
sion Viejo man and the rape of his fiancee. Those
charges include one count of attempted murder,
two counts of rape, two counts of forcible oral
copulation, two counts of robbery and one count
of burglary.
Police have said satanic svmbols were scrawled

at some of the murder scenes, and some victims
bodies were mutilated. The series of attacks ter
rorized the state last summer after authorities
said they were the work of one man, dubbed the
Night Stalker.
The Burbank victim, whom Ramirez is accused
of assaulting last May 30, pointed to him as her
attacker.
Whitworth identified
SAN FRANCISCO — A former girlfriend of
confessed spy John Walker testified yesterday
that Jerry Whitworth, on trial for espionage, told
her that Walker was financing his high-flying life
style by selling classified information "to an
ally," possibly Israel.
Whitworth, a retired Navy radioman, is
accused of selling secrets to the Soviet Union
through Walker for $332,000.
Myra Jean Barnes of Fresno, a former U. S.
Navy dental technician, told Whitworth's lawyer
her only reaction to Whitworth's comment about
the link to Israel was that it was "a novel idea."
"I take it you didn't think much of this?" asked
attorney James Larson.
"It sounded like a rather novel idea," said
Barnes. "I'd never heard of selling secrets to an
ally before."
"It sounded novel?" asked Larson.

"Well, HKe sometning new," said the witness.
Barnes was the first witness in Whitworth's
trial to quote the defendant as discussing the sale
of Navy secrets.
Later in the day, Navy Lt. Terry Pierce, who
served with Whitworth aboard the USS Niagra
Falls, indicated that the radioman longed for the
good life enjoyed by his friend Walker.
"He had a friend who was taking a sailing trip
to the western Pacific," said Pierce. "He consid
ered this to be the ultimate in life, I believe."
Pierce also said he once walked in on Whit
worth while he was poring over top secret
blueprints of a complicated communications sys
tem.
"I thought that was a little odd," Pierce said.
"But he said he just wanted to make sure it was
working properly."
Ms. Barnes said she met Walker through Whit
worth in late 1971 or early 1972 when she was
rooming with Whitworth's then-girlfriend, and
they went sailing on Walker's boat, "The Dirty
Old Man."
