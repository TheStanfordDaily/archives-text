### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
Now that one of the nation's 32
Rhodes scholars selected last Decem
ber has turned down the prestigious
award, senior Michael Collins,
ranking member of Stanford's Coun
cil of Presidents, has been named a
1986 Rhodes scholar.

"Man certainly is the übiquitous
animal," Collins said as he received
the award at an informal ceremony in
Baltimore. "Yeah, that's it. übiqui
tous."
Collins said he applied for the fel
lowship because he wants to study at
Oxford and hopes someday to
become an educated person. "I must
say that those medieval spires and
academic traditions have enthralled
scholars, writers and poets for cen
turies," he said. "Hoover Tower, in

spite of its fascinating reservoir tip,
just doesn't do it for me."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, asked how he felt about Col
lins receiving the Rhodes scholarship,
said he had no comment at the pres
ent time.
The Rhodes scholarships were es
tablished in 1902 by Cecil John
Rhodes, a British politician who
made a fortune from diamond mines
in what is now Zimbabwe. Seventy
two students are chosen each year
from around the world to spend two
years studying at Oxford.
With the admission of the 1986
group, the total number of Rhodes
scholars is 2,436
Fellow COP member Andrew
Frisch said he was "ecstatic" over
Collins' monumental achievement.
"It was obviously given to Mike for
his finely integrated combination of
libertarian and Marxist beliefs,"
Frisch said.
"Certainly nobody ever said Mike
was a radical," he added.
"Certainly nobody ever thought
Mike had an ounce of intelligence,"
said a senior official in the Kennedy
administration. "It's quite a shock for
all of us."
Collins said in an interview last
night that he wasn't shocked, noting
only. "Nothing can soften the ham
micr and coffin," and repeatedly ask
ing that the student body vote for the
Chappie COP slate this spring even
though they are not only unqualified
but also not in any way funnv.
