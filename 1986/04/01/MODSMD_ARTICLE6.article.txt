"The heck with careerism," savs
Provost James Rosse. "Nuts to
anti-intellectualism. Knowledge for

Feature

the sake of knowledge — that's my
credo. You just can't overestimate
the value of a liberal education."
Rosse, the University's No. 2 ad
ministrator, sings a familiar tune as
he prepares to take over the Stan
ford presidency during Donald
Kennedy's sabbatical next winter.
Rosse discusses the circuitous
route that brought him to his cur

rent position.
Beginning as a biology major at
the University of Minnesota, Rosse
shifted his tack more than once as
an undergraduate.
"I'm living proof that the best
education is a broad-based one,"
he says. "One day, late in my fresh
man year, I was struggling in an in
troductory bio lab. We were dis
secting frogs. There were an odd
number of students in the class, and
I was the one who worked without
a partner.
"The point of the lab — I re
member it clearly — was to remove
the gall bladder from a frog. Three
times I tried, with three frogs, hold
ing the little thing between my

thumb and finger just like so, and
three times I squashed it.
"Well, I wanted to be a biologist,
a professor, eventually head of the
FDA or something of that nature,
but I learned not to plan too far in
the future.
"My biology professor, who was
also my adviser, approached me
that day after the lab. He invited
me into his office and sat me down,
then gave me a stern look, pulled in
a deep breath, exhaled slowly, and
said to me, 'Jim, what else are you
thinking of majoring in?' and 1 said,
'Maybe economics,' and he said,
'Jim, be an economics major.' "
