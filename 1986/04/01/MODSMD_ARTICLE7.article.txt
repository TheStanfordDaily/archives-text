Officials at Marriott's Great America in San Jose, much
impressed by the mirth displayed hy college students in
Paini Springs last week, have announced plans for an in
teractive environment to be called "Spring Break."
"It won't be like our other, conventional rides," the
park's development guru. Vice President Whoop T. Doo
said at a press conference yesterday. "We envision a street
scenario modeled after the Universal Studios approach."
Spring Break will duplicate a sunny, upper-middle
class, downtown thoroughfare. Concealed air condition
ing will fill the space with the smell of coconut tanning oil
and stale beer. The whole room will be converted into a
huge tanning booth with ultraviolet lights so that visitors
can tan while they play.

"We'll have life-like mannequins of blushing, giggling
coeds with removable bikini tops and cops that throw fake
tear gas when they hear bad language. Each visitor will be
given a water pistol to shoot through the open sun roofs of
our specially designed, bounceable Nerf cars.
"Our target market is the physically mature but other
wise infantile young males who are so prevalent in this
area, with all the college campuses around," Doo said.
"We'd just like to get our fair share of profits out of the
'testosterone market,' as we like to call it."
Reactions from officials at most of the major theme
parks in the state were guarded, but executives from
Magic Mountain and Knott's Berry Farm said they would
consider their own "environments" if Great America's
experiment works out.
Great America officials expect Spring Break to be open
to the public by June.
