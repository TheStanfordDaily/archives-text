# Stanford pushes for land-use bill
## Kennedy responds to local critics 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
The University has struck back at
criticism of an Assembly bill that
would prevent nearby cities from ex
ercising greater control over Stanford
lands.
In a March 20 letter to the Assem
bly Local Government Committee,
University President Donald Ken
nedy repeated Stanford's argument
that the University's 8,200 acres of
academic lands should remain in un
incorporated San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, where it would not be
subject to the control of adjacent
cities.
Kennedy said that integrated plan
ning of projects like the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
would be "all but impossible" should
communities in San Mateo County
annex portions of Stanford land, as
current law permits them to do.
"SLACs particle beam would start
in Woodside, collide in Menlo Park,
and then some of the particles would
travel through an underground ring in
Portola Valley," he wrote.
AB 3075, sponsored by As
semblyman Dominic Cortese (D-San
Jose), would prevent neighboring
cities from annexing without permis

sion college lands that have been set
aside for future academic use.
Stanford officials say the bill would
stop the potential for chaotic plan
ning that would require the approval
of several cities for any one project.
But local community leaders say the
bill is Stanford's attempt to slip
around tough local zoning scrutiny by
answering only to county planners.
Menlo Park City Councilman Jack
Morris has called AB 3075 a "land
grab" bill, telling The Daily last
month that Stanford "does not feel
that it ought to play under the same
rules as everyone else."
In his letter, Kennedy wrote that
Stanford and Santa Clara County
have cooperated in planning develop
ment on the part of the campus which
sits in Santa Clara County. He said
that AB 3075 would ensure a
similarly cooperative relationship in
San Mateo County, where SLAC,
Jasper Ridge and 700 agricultural
acres planned for future academic de
velopment sit.
"Our view is that competing land
considerations are better weighed by
the county than by an adjacent
municipality which has a strong
vested interest in precluding con
struction of facilities needed for the
academic enterprise," he wrote.
