■ Opportunities for
FIELDWORK ON THE
EFFECTS OF HIGH
TECHNOLOGY
The Stanford Fieldwork Project on the Human Impacts '
and Sociocultural Implications of High Technology, now
getting started, is a multi-year undertaking that will provide
limited funding for selected doctoral and masters candi
dates, and undergraduates doing Honors theses, to con
duct and write up field research relevant to selected prob
lems in the general area of the observed or projected ef
fects on people of high technology — especially mic
roelectronic, biotechnical, or materials-science technol
ogy.
Field reserach will include interviewing, and observa
tion where possible, and might deal with problems (in
cluding public policy issues) in areas such as: microelec
tronics and lateral thinking; expert systems and cultural fit;
robotics and body image; gene therapy and medical
ethics; networking and the expansion of political initiative;
engineered species and the enrichment of Third World
food supplies; inequitable, disemploying or alienating as
pects of high technology; etc.
Students majoring in scientific or technical disciplines
are most welcome to apply to participate, as are those from
the social sciences and humanities. In some cases
fieldwork will be carried out by teams of two or three stu
dents, constituted so as to take advantage of both
technical-scientific and social science or humanistic
background.
The basic mode of fieldwork will be an adapted form of
ethnography, and all students who participate will be ex
pected to possess or develop certain fieldwork skills.
These can be developed by enrolling in various university
courses.
