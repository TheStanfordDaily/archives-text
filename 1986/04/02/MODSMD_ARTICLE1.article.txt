# Packard criticizes research cutbacks

Recent proposals to reduce federal
support for research conducted at
colleges and universities are a
"serious mistake," said David Pack
ard, chairman of the White House
Science Council's panel on "The
Health of U.S. Universities and Col
leges."
In an interview with the University
News Service, Packard, a former dep
uty secretary of defense who is cur
rently chairman of the board of
Hewlett-Packard, said the proposals
advocated by the Office of Manage
ment and Budget (OMB) and de
signed to limit reimbursement of
administrative overhead costs ac
crued by universities are "out of tune
with what was needed."
The OMB proposals, which were
announced Feb. 12, would limit the
amount of administrative overhead
costs that universities could charge
the federal government. The
proposals would cap reimbursement
of University administrative costs to
26 percent of the direct costs of
federally sponsored research. The
University currently recovers the
equivalent of about 29 percent of
these costs. A further reduction of the
recovery rate to 20 percent was also
proposed to take effect April 1, 1987.
OMB estimated that its proposal
would save the U.S. government
$100 million in fiscal year 1987 and
more than $200 million in 1988,
making it "consistent with the presi
dent's fiscal year 1987 budget and the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings 'Balanced
Budget and Emergency Deficit Con
trol Act of 1985.' "
Although the controversial
proposals were scheduled to take ef
fect yesterday, OMB has announced
that it will delay implementation of
the policy after receiving a barrage of
protests from research-oriented uni
versities around the country. Univer
sities were particularly concerned
with the brevity of the consultation
period and a lack of involvement of
research institutions in the policy de
velopment process.
According to University Provost
James Rosse, both proposed recovery
rates are significantly lower than the
actual administrative costs that Stan
ford currently incurs while supporting
federal research. If implemented, the
proposals would necessitate addi
tional operating budget cuts or fur
ther increases from other University
income sources.
At a Feb. 20 meeting of the Faculty
Senate, University President Donald
Kennedy warned that the proposals
would cost Stanford $1.5 million in
the first year, rising to $10 million an
nually after the full implementation
of the 20 percent cap.
The ability to recoup costs associ
ated with sponsored research is con
sidered vital to Stanford's financial
well-being. Last year, Stanford
received about $60 million from the
federal government to offset indirect
costs associated with federal research
projects.
Indirect cost recovery from federal
and non-federal sources totaled
$82.8 million in the University's
1985-86 operating budget, a source
of operating budget income surpassed
only by the $124.7 million provided
by tuition and fees.
According to Packard, the OMB
"lacks any understanding of what the
problem is all about." The OMB
proposals affected only one of the is
sues addressed by the White House
council's recommendations on
federal support for university re
search.
Although the panel warned of
"calamitous" effects if the recom
mendations were not considered as
an "integrated package," the OMB
focused on the administrative over
head issue while ignoring other coun
cil recommendations designed to sub
stantially increase the indirect frac
tion of those total research costs,
Packard said.
The panel agreed that the federal

government should pay the full costs
of university research, Packard said.
The panel report suggests methods to
improve cooperation between the
federal government and universities
in addition to calling for significant
increases in federal research support.
Among the recommendations are
changes in the methods of determin
ing research costs, including a new
formula for more rapid depreciation
of university buildings and scientific
equipment, elimination of faculty ef
fort reporting, and a reorganization
of the federal tax code to foster better
industry-university relations.
Because the panel found consider
able disagreement regarding the indi
rect costs of research, its report called
for a fixed ceiling on the
administration-related portion of
those costs to be phased in over a
two-year period. These reductions
would be offset by changes in other
indirect cost rates that would "allow
the universities to recover their full
costs," Packard said.
Asked if the panel's call for in
creased federal support for research
was realistic in light of existing
federal budget deficits, Packard said
the recommendations "can be imple
mented without any increase in the
overall (budget) allocated for re
search and development."
