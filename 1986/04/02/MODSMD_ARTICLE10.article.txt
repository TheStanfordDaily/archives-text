### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
With summer fast approaching,
the University's housing director
says many students have already
begun to investigate on-campus
residence opportunities for the
months ahead.
"We generally have about 1,200
single students plus the family stu
dents who stay all year round who
require University housing," said
Roger Whitney, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and director of the
Stanford Housing Center.
"Basically, we meet the demand.
We have enough housing for the
people who want it."
Whitney said housing will be
available from June 22 to Sept. 13
to registered students, non
registered matriculated students
and some high school and foreign
students taking courses at Stan
ford, as well as to the participants

in many other programs and semi
nars.
The areas set aside to house stu
dents are Wilbur, Crothers
Memorial, Manzanita Park, Mir
rielees and one summer co-op
house. In addition, Roble, Stern,
Governor s Corner and part of
Mirrielees will be used largely to
house the participants in conven
tions and conferences scheduled
for the summer.
Rates for non-student housing
vary with each complex, with
Governor's Corner topping the list
at $27.50 per day for a stay of less
than four weeks to $19.75 daily
for a period of eight weeks or
more.
Other offerings include Roble
and Stern Halls, with rates ranging
from $22.75 per day for a single
room for less than a four-week
stay to $12.25 per day for people
sharing a double room and staying
for more than eight weeks.
