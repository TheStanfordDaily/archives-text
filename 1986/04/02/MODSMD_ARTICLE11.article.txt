## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Libyan action was right 
### 
When U.S. forces began naval maneuvers off the
Libyan coast last month, the Reagan Administration
and U.S. military leaders were faced with a difficult
decision: whether or not to send ships across Libyan
leader Moammar Khadafi's "line of death" across the
Gulf of Sidra and risk a military confrontation. None of
the options were pleasant, and all could have backfired
on the United States. But by opting to challenge
Khadafi, the United States correctly chose the lesser of
two evils.
If the United States chose not to enter the forbidden
waters, considered international territory by the
United States, the Libyan leader would have boasted
victory over a mighty supeipower and perhaps been
emboldened to oppose international use of its coastal
waters. Refusing to retaliate once U.S. planes were
fired upon by Libyan missiles would have sent Khadafi
a similar message.
One State Department official observed, "When
Khadafi tossed out a challenge like [the 'line of death'],
we had no choice but to respond." Crossing into the
Gulf of Sidra and retaliating against the Mar. 24
Libyan attack was the only way the United States could
assert its right to navigate in international waters and
show Khadafi that the United States cannot be manip
ulated by the threats of a ruthless leader.

Furthermore, the confrontation, in which a Navy
task force destroyed at least two Libyan ships and an
anti-aircraft radar site, showed Khadafi that any
Libyan use of force will draw U.S. retaliation. Such ac
tion is perhaps the only way to communicate with a
leader who praised terrorist attacks in Rome and
Vienna last year.
When the United State made its choice, it had to
consider the possibility that its action would provoke a
new wave of anti-American terrorism around the
world. Since individual incidents of terrorism must be
dealt with on a case-by-case basis, the Administration
made the only move it could by increasing security at
U.S. embassies and military bases. If the United States
had backed down to Khadafi's threats, the risk of ter
rorism would now be much higher since terrorists
around the world would have received the message
that the United States is reluctant to retaliate.
The confrontation was an unfortunate symptom of
the unrest that plagues a very troubled region, a situa
tion that flawed U.S. policy in the region has certainly
helped to create. Regardless of policy shortcomings,
however, the situation demanded decisive U.S. action,
and in this case, as President Reagan said, the con
frontation was a demonstration of the U.S. "ability to
defend the Free World's interests."
