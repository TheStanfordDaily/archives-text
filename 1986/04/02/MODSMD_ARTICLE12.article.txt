## Remember other Aquino 
### 
It is a tragedy that Corazon Aquino is president of the
Philippines today. A tragedy and a shame. The tragedy is
the world's. The shame belongs to us. Washington's sup
port of the revolution in the Philippines cannot erase the
fact that the U.S. government may have years ago
sabotaged the chances for such a successful revolution.
Aquino is no doubt a noble and courageous woman, an in
spiration to her people. But she is living off her political
inheritance, and no one knows how long that will last. She
would probably be the first to say that she should not be
president — because she should not be a widow.
That the world should come to know Benigno Aquino
only as he bled to death on the tarmac at the Manila air
port, only as he was carried aloft in his Plexiglas-topped
coffin — only as a memory — is a cruel loss. But not so
much for Aquino as for the world. For his own part,
Aquino was a man who had already accepted death, and.
in a way, had realized that he, like Ferdinand Marcos, was
already cheating the clock. But he also had a sense that a
far larger clock was running out for democracy in the
Philippines, and so he clung to life.

I met Aquino at Dartmouth — culturally and
geographically a long way from home for him, and yet he
seemed comfortable there. He could have stayed in the
United States, slipped permanently into the life of a uni
versity somewhere. He would have been one of those in
tense, popular professors, the kind who always has a
crowd around him at lunchtime and whose desk hasn't
seen the light of day for years. I think that if he had been
given nine lives — or not even nine — he would have cho
sen to live one of them in a place like Hanover, N.H. or
Palo Alto. He loved history, and loved talking about it.
And yet he so clearly had his calling. The world was his
neighborhood. One felt him to be a kind of Filipino
Thomas Jefferson. But of course he wasn't given nine
lives. Some would say he was given less than one. Aquino
himself would probably have said that he had lived one
life and was embarking on the second.
"I didn't see the moon or the stars for seven years," he
said. The Aquino I knew was the former prisoner of con
science. He was one of the beneficiaries of Jimmy Carter's
human rights policies, one of the last before the hush of
President Reagan's silent diplomacy and before Vice
President George Bush loved the way Marcos practiced
democracy. The way Marcos practiced it in Aquino's case
was to keep him imprisoned for seven years, much of it in
solitary confinement. When Aquino was not allowed to
read, he made a study of the behavior of the ants on the
wall of his cell that was later published in an entomology
journal. When he was allowed to read, he read Filipino
history, a chronicle that would supply him with the pseu
donym under which he traveled to his death: Bonifacio,
the name of a Filipino who was killed by his political op
ponents during the fight for independence from Spain.
He was never overtly tortured; he was visited from time
to time by Imelda Marcos. At one point a telephone was
installed in his cell. It was, he was told, connected to the
Malacanang Palace. He could pick it up and talk to

Marcos himself. And he had but to stop opposing Marcos
and he was free.
Aquino was tried by an extrajudicial court under mar
tial law and sentenced to death. He was made to think he
would be executed, but remained in prison for three years
after that, there being limits even to what Marcos could do
without making too much trouble. Aquino went on a
hunger strike in prison. He went so far — nearly six weeks
— that even when he was persuaded to end it, it was
feared that he would die anyway. Since he was not
treated, it is not known for sure, but he may have had the
first of several heart attacks at that time.
He was not afraid of dying after that, he said. He said
that he almost felt that he had died and come back to life.
He expressed a private kind of religious joy — his attitude
was that everything that came after that was a kind of
bonus, a gift.
And though he was still recovering from coronary
bypass surgery — and though he could have had perma
nent asylum in the United States — he was planning, even
in 1980, to return: "He can have me shot, he can jail me
or he can set me free." And though Marcos was known to
have agents in the United States, Aquino traveled without
aides or bodyguards and seemed to be unafraid. Where he
lived was no secret. In Hanover he made a speech about
what he thought would happen if the opposition to
Marcos finally took to the streets: "When those young
boys and those young girls die in the confrontation, the
mothers will ask: 'And where did the bullets come from?'
And at that point you might find a qualitative change in
the reservoir of good will toward the United States."
Luckily for us, the confrontation was short.
So why did Aquino return? It was not surprising to dis
cover that Aquino invoked Gandhi in the homecoming
speech he prepared but never got to deliver: "According
to Gandhi, the willing sacrifice of the innocent is the most
powerful answer to insolent tyranny that has yet been
conceived by God and man." And so Aquino was
prepared to die — prepared but not eager. He did not
throw his life away, he offered it up.
Aquino's attitude about his life allowed him to risk it in
a way few men have had the courage to do. Knowing the
origins of some of that courage, we can hardly wonder
that he felt compelled to return to its source. And if it
took his death to return the Philippines to democracy, I
have no doubt that he would have offered it.
But did it? What we must ask ourselves (what Reagan
and Shultz must ask themselves, if they dare) is "was it ne
cessary?" Does anyone doubt the we let it happen, that
our intelligence services knew when and where just as well
as Marcos' did? Perhaps Washington was afraid that it
couldn't control Aquino the way it controlled Marcos. It
knew that Marcos had to go, but it was betting on a clone
to take his place. It was as though Abraham took Isaac up
the mountain and God said nothing.
And so today the Filipinos have the wife of Aquino, and
they (in Manila if not in Mindanao) and we love her for
good reason. But will they love her tomorrow? Benigno
Aquino was more than just the spark to Cory's revolution.
He was the whole box of matches.
