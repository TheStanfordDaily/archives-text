Varsity cuts wrong
It was recently announced that five
varsity sports will be removed from
the Athletic Department budget as of
next year. Maybe you care about
wrestling, softball, field hockey or
men's and women's fencing. Maybe
you don't. In either case, you have no
choice but to care that the adminis
tration of your university is making
stupid and tragic mistakes. A couple
hundred of your current classmates
will be caused a great deal of pain,
and the quality of life at your univer
sity will be permanently com
promised.
The purpose of a university athletic
department is not to make a profit. It
is to provide the opportunity for stu
dents to participate in competitive
sports. Stanford prides itself on its
ability to attract the nation's finest
students to the freshman class everv

year: bright, involved, active young
people. I have seen a pamphlet Stan
ford published, designed to attract
these well-rounded youth; it boasts
about the number of varsity sports
available here. It should be proud.
That is a valid measure of a school's
commitment to the health and happi
ness of the students once they are ad
mitted. I suppose the pamphlet will
have to be revised if that proud num
ber is reduced by five â€” or perhaps
eliminated, since a school whose ath
letic department is interested solely in
money has no right to attract bright,
athletic students.
Cutting the small sports is never
the right answer. Even on a simply fi
nancial level, it is not much help for
an ailing Athletic Department.
Removing a fencing coach's salary
does nothing to balance the basket
ball team's unlimited budget. Erasing
field hockey's small draw is nothing
against the entire football team

staying in a hotel in Palo Alto the
night before every home game. Since
the problem will remain, more cuts
will have to be made next year. Prob
ably more walk-on sports will fall
prey to this administration's short
sighted "solution." When nothing is
left but a couple of sports one must be
biologically unusual to play, and
when the applications from those
bright, well-rounded students fall off
because they are bright enough to
know that they would be happier
elsewhere, it will be too late.
Think now of those of us who are
here right now. attending this school
because of the life it offered us.
Counting the people who are on
those five teams now. the people who
want to be on those teams next year
and the people who watch us com
pete. I estimate I can speak for two
hundred students who will be directly
affected by these cuts, and we are
shocked and in pain.

We chose this school partly be
cause it had these teams. To remove
them now is an incredible breach of
faith. Must a talented athlete now
choose between transferring to an
other school or giving up his or her
sport? Must we forever feel bitterness
and pain when we think of the four
years we entrusted to this school?
I don't know if University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and Athletic
Director Andy Geiger care that I will
hate them (and I mean that; I don't
use such words lightly) if they do this.
I don't know if Dean of Admissions
Jean Fetter cares that 1 will never
again feel able to recommend Stan
ford to the high school students who
value my opinion. But they should,
because I am not alone, and I am not
unreasonable. I am one student of
many, who feels that my university
has betrayed me.
