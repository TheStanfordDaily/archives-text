## Consider all alternatives 
### 
The other day I saw some interesting graffiti in a stall of
a ladies' room in Meyer Library. True to Meyer restroom
style, one woman had written a question and various
others had responded. The conversation shows a variety
of opinions on a weighty subject.
"Abortion: Is it wrong to destroy one life as opposed to
two? Being a Stanford woman, is abortion the best possi
ble solution? In dropping out of school to support a child,
is either benefitting? What to do?"
"Don't have an abortion! , . . Nine months is not that
long and you don't have to drop out of school! ... Mil
lions of people would love to bring up your son or
daughter in a happy, healthy home. Don't act too fast.
Don't get desperate."
"I disagree. Don't selfishly add to the population prob
lem on this planet."
"You don't think killing is selfish?"

NELLIE HAUKE

"Let them adopt a child who isn't white. There are
plenty of kids who need parents."
"Get in touch with the Crisis Pregnancy Center.. ..
Hang in there and make use of the resources available to
you." 112 r
"Don't leave school and try to provide a life to a chifti
who is not completely wanted! Both you'and the child will
be sorry."
"There are more women here at Stanford who have
gone through the same thing."
"Cowell refers 200 women a year to doctors who per
form abortions."
The writers had very different points of view, but
seemed to agree in some ways: 1) They all backed up their
point of view with ethical arguments — such as the danger
of overpopulation or the need to fulfill oneself. 2) They all
see abortion as a bad thing, even if a necessary evil. This
characterizes the very complex debate about abortion in
general. We all agree that at some point in the life of a
fetus, abortion becomes killing, but we disagree on when
and on the relative value between the fetus' life and other
values such as one's own material well-being, fulfillment
and the earth's population problem.
For my part. I am both pro-life and pro-choice: I think
that legislation to ban abortion, to cut Medicare for it.
etc., will only mean that people will get it done illegally
and harmfully; but I also think that abortion is killing
from the beginning. In a general way, I compare abortion
to killing someone in self-defense — a person perceives
that if she does not kill the attacker, she will be greatly
harmed. Unlike in an attack, however, a woman in a crisis
pregnancy usually has a week or more to consider how to
respond to the perceived threat. But in the anxiety of the
moment, she may act hastily; she may feel more threat
ened than the pregnancy warrants, and resort to abortion
perhaps too quickly.

We should re-examine what pro-choice means. Often
women "choose" to have an abortion because they think
they really have no choice, no alternative. I think women
should be provided with more alternatives, and consider
the realistic possibility that they can choose not to abort
their baby, and find support in this decision. I think that
churches and other well-meaning groups should do more
of this — providing alternatives to abortion — rather than
simply campaigning to makeit illegal. That is why groups
such as the Stanford Crisis Pregnancy Network are such a
good idea.
But all of us should think about the problem not only
for public policy but also in our own ethical and sexual
lives. If we decide to enter a sexual relationship, many of
us take some precautions against getting pregnant. But
since few methods of birth control are foolproof,
shouldn't a woman ask herself and her partner what they
would do if she became pregnant? Is the partner aware of
the possibility of pregnancy and sensitive to her feelings
about the subject? Would he be willing to support her in
whatever decision she made and the emotional and ma
terial consequences? If she has an abortion, she may ex
perience powerful feelings of loss. If she decides to carry
the pregnancy to term, she must decide whether to be a
single parent or whether the father will be involved in
raising it. Considering that sex is capable of creating life,
does it with this person? (I am speaki»g
from the women's angle here mainly because I ama
woman myself, and because the woman is the one most af
fected by a crisis pregnancy. But men, being crucial to the
process, might consider these questions also.)
I think that the bitter debate about legislation, which is
so much in the media, helps distort the question for us as
individuals. So much around us combines to confuse the
issue. First, there is language. The fetus itself is called by
various names: to the "pro-lifers," it is a "baby," with all
the emotional connotations that brings; to doctors who do
abortions, it is the "product of conception" — and thus
easier to sweep out of the way. We should be aware of the
connotations presented by what we hear, and of what we
ourselves think and feel about what the fetus is. Second,
as one of the writers on the wall showed, people may think
too narrowly of the possibilities: "Is it better to destroy
one life or two? Should I drop out of school?" Especially
at Stanford, where we feel we must develop our minds, we
may think that to have a baby would indeed destroy our
lives. But we should be flexible and imaginative; after all,
we can t plan out our lives totally in any case. We might
consider that taking on the huge challenge of bearing a
child might be a viable alternative and even a fulfilling ex
perience.
And there are people who can help in this undertaking
there are many material and emotional resources
available. Nobody should feel that her only alternative is
abortion. She has to make her own decisions and be able
to live with them. But she should be aware that she is not
trapped: abortion is not the only way out.

such as the Stanford Crisis Pregnancy Network are such a
good idea.
But all of us should think about the problem not only
for public policy but also in our own ethical and sexual
lives. If we decide to enter a sexual relationship, many of
us take some precautions against getting pregnant. But
since few methods of birth control are foolproof,
shouldn't a woman ask herself and her partner what they
would do if she became pregnant? Is the partner aware of
the possibility of pregnancy and sensitive to her feelings
about the subject? Would he be willing to support her in
whatever decision she made and the emotional and ma
terial consequences? If she has an abortion, she may ex
perience powerful feelings of loss. If she decides to carry
the pregnancy to term, she must decide whether to be a
single parent or whether the father will be involved in
raising it. Considering that sex is capable of creating life,
does it with this person? (I am speaki»g
from the women's angle here mainly because I ama
woman myself, and because the woman is the one most af
fected by a crisis pregnancy. But men, being crucial to the
process, might consider these questions also.)
I think that the bitter debate about legislation, which is
so much in the media, helps distort the question for us as
individuals. So much around us combines to confuse the
issue. First, there is language. The fetus itself is called by
various names: to the "pro-lifers," it is a "baby," with all
the emotional connotations that brings; to doctors who do
abortions, it is the "product of conception" — and thus
easier to sweep out of the way. We should be aware of the
connotations presented by what we hear, and of what we
ourselves think and feel about what the fetus is. Second,
as one of the writers on the wall showed, people may think
too narrowly of the possibilities: "Is it better to destroy
one life or two? Should I drop out of school?" Especially
at Stanford, where we feel we must develop our minds, we
may think that to have a baby would indeed destroy our
lives. But we should be flexible and imaginative; after all,
we can t plan out our lives totally in any case. We might
consider that taking on the huge challenge of bearing a
child might be a viable alternative and even a fulfilling ex
perience.
And there are people who can help in this undertaking
there are many material and emotional resources
available. Nobody should feel that her only alternative is
abortion. She has to make her own decisions and be able
to live with them. But she should be aware that she is not
trapped: abortion is not the only way out.

The other day I saw some interesting graffiti in a stall of
a ladies' room in Meyer Library. True to Meyer restroom
style, one woman had written a question and various
others had responded. The conversation shows a variety
of opinions on a weighty subject.
"Abortion: Is it wrong to destroy one life as opposed to
two? Being a Stanford woman, is abortion the best possi
ble solution? In dropping out of school to support a child,
is either benefitting? What to do?"
"Don't have an abortion! , . . Nine months is not that
long and you don't have to drop out of school! ... Mil
lions of people would love to bring up your son or
daughter in a happy, healthy home. Don't act too fast.
Don't get desperate."
"I disagree. Don't selfishly add to the population prob
lem on this planet."
"You don't think killing is selfish?"

NELLIE HAUKE

"Let them adopt a child who isn't white. There are
plenty of kids who need parents."
"Get in touch with the Crisis Pregnancy Center.. ..
Hang in there and make use of the resources available to
you." 112 r
"Don't leave school and try to provide a life to a chifti
who is not completely wanted! Both you'and the child will
be sorry."
"There are more women here at Stanford who have
gone through the same thing."
"Cowell refers 200 women a year to doctors who per
form abortions."
The writers had very different points of view, but
seemed to agree in some ways: 1) They all backed up their
point of view with ethical arguments — such as the danger
of overpopulation or the need to fulfill oneself. 2) They all
see abortion as a bad thing, even if a necessary evil. This
characterizes the very complex debate about abortion in
general. We all agree that at some point in the life of a
fetus, abortion becomes killing, but we disagree on when
and on the relative value between the fetus' life and other
values such as one's own material well-being, fulfillment
and the earth's population problem.
For my part. I am both pro-life and pro-choice: I think
that legislation to ban abortion, to cut Medicare for it.
etc., will only mean that people will get it done illegally
and harmfully; but I also think that abortion is killing
from the beginning. In a general way, I compare abortion
to killing someone in self-defense — a person perceives
that if she does not kill the attacker, she will be greatly
harmed. Unlike in an attack, however, a woman in a crisis
pregnancy usually has a week or more to consider how to
respond to the perceived threat. But in the anxiety of the
moment, she may act hastily; she may feel more threat
ened than the pregnancy warrants, and resort to abortion
perhaps too quickly.

We should re-examine what pro-choice means. Often
women "choose" to have an abortion because they think
they really have no choice, no alternative. I think women
should be provided with more alternatives, and consider
the realistic possibility that they can choose not to abort
their baby, and find support in this decision. I think that
churches and other well-meaning groups should do more
of this — providing alternatives to abortion — rather than
simply campaigning to makeit illegal. That is why groups
such as the Stanford Crisis Pregnancy Network are such a
good idea.
