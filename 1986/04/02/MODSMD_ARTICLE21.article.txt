# Wisdom springs eternal: The Bug returneth
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Traditionally, spring quarter at Stanford is the time to
kick back, relax and work on perfecting that golden tan.
Traditionally, it's also the time to take about three weeks
off from doing research for columns like Bug Me.
Well, far be it from me to break tradition. Since Dead
Week, I ve just been kicking back, relaxing, perfecting
that golden tan, and basically being as lazy as a soapdish.
And of course, the whole spring quarter ethos really does
preclude doing any serious work.
What I m trying to say here is that I really haven't done
much work for this column in the recent past. So this week
I am forced to print all the scraps in my file, the flotsam
and jetsam of Bug Me, the dregs, leftovers, whatever your
little heart desires to call them.
I do feel a little guilty about this, and I pledge to do bet
ter in the future (like, for example, next week), but for
now this will have to do. I anticipate that the expression of
public outrage in response to this could be pretty over
whelming. Please, I urge you, be understanding. Don't
hurt me. Or my family.
Dear Bug Me,
How much money Joes Stanford make annually from
parking tickets issued on campus? What is the monev used
for?
-Kukla, Fran and Ollie
1 was hoping that my research into this question would
put me on the trail of some huge, vile profiteering scandal
ultimately leading right up to Donald Kennedy's door.
(Or is that James Rosse's door?) "Ticketgate," or some
thing like that. Think of all the money involved. Think of
how tuition would drop if all that money was channelled
in the right direction.

Unforunately, none of that materialized. My romantic
visions of muckraking crystallized as I was referred from
the Stanford Police to the Santa Clara County Sheriffs
Office to the Santa Clara County Office of Parking Viola
tions.
It turns out that the University doesn't make a red cent
(or any other colored cent) from parking tickets collected
on campus. All the money goes to the Santa Clara County
Sheriff s Department Office of Parking Violations.
The people there certainly weren't about to tell me how
much they collect from on-campus tickets. Here's an ex
cerpt from the conversation I had with the woman in that
office:

"Yes, could you please tell me how much money is col
lected annually in parking tickets issued on the Stanford
campus?"
"No ... uh ... I can't tell you that."
"Well, could you tell me what the money is used for?"
"Uh . . . no, I can't tell you that."
Okay, great, you've been very helpful.
Dear Bug Me,
Who is Dr. Demento really and how old is he? How long
has he been demented?
-Anonymous
I wasn't able to talk to the demented one himself, so all

of this is second-hand information. He might have been a
little sensitive about this kind of question anyway.
I did talk to the people at Imaginary Entertainment
Company, who act as agents for Dr. Demento (and also
"Weird Al" Yankovic). They told me that Dr. Demento's
real name is Barret Hansen, and he is now celebrating his
50th year as Dr. Demento. He has released a new album
to commemorate the occasion.
The gentleman I talked to didn't know exactly how old
the doctor is, but did say that he's middle-aged.
Dear Bug Me,
What Joes G.O.P. stand for, in the political party sense?
-Anonymous
I've tried and tried to keep politics out of this column,
but it just seems to rear its ugly head everywhere.
G.O.P. is a common nickname for the Republican
Party. According to the Encyclopedia Americana, the
name dates from the presidential election of 1896. At the
time of that election, the United States had a Democratic
president, and was mired in the depths of a serious de
pression. The Republican candidate, William Mckinley,
was elected overwhelmingly, along with Republican
majorities in both houses of Congress.
A period of recovery followed close on the heels of the
election, and grateful Americans nicknamed the
Republicans the "Grand Old Party." The name stuck, and
is now more commonly abbreviated, to G.O.P.
It's a pretty erroneous nickname in reality. The Demo
cratic Party is actually much older than the Republican
Party (which was formed just before the Civil War), and
the question of grandness is certainly a subjective judge
ment. But I don't want to generate too "inch hate mail, so
I'll just leave it at that.

kick back, relax and work on perfecting that golden tan.
Traditionally, it's also the time to take about three weeks
off from doing research for columns like Bug Me.
Well, far be it from me to break tradition. Since Dead
Week, I ve just been kicking back, relaxing, perfecting
that golden tan, and basically being as lazy as a soapdish.
And of course, the whole spring quarter ethos really does
preclude doing any serious work.
What I m trying to say here is that I really haven't done
much work for this column in the recent past. So this week
I am forced to print all the scraps in my file, the flotsam
and jetsam of Bug Me, the dregs, leftovers, whatever your
little heart desires to call them.
I do feel a little guilty about this, and I pledge to do bet
ter in the future (like, for example, next week), but for
now this will have to do. I anticipate that the expression of
public outrage in response to this could be pretty over
whelming. Please, I urge you, be understanding. Don't
hurt me. Or my family.
Dear Bug Me,
How much money Joes Stanford make annually from
parking tickets issued on campus? What is the monev used
for?
-Kukla, Fran and Ollie
1 was hoping that my research into this question would
put me on the trail of some huge, vile profiteering scandal
ultimately leading right up to Donald Kennedy's door.
(Or is that James Rosse's door?) "Ticketgate," or some
thing like that. Think of all the money involved. Think of
how tuition would drop if all that money was channelled
in the right direction.

Unforunately, none of that materialized. My romantic
visions of muckraking crystallized as I was referred from
the Stanford Police to the Santa Clara County Sheriffs
Office to the Santa Clara County Office of Parking Viola
tions.
It turns out that the University doesn't make a red cent
(or any other colored cent) from parking tickets collected
on campus. All the money goes to the Santa Clara County
Sheriff s Department Office of Parking Violations.
The people there certainly weren't about to tell me how
much they collect from on-campus tickets. Here's an ex
cerpt from the conversation I had with the woman in that
office:

"Yes, could you please tell me how much money is col
lected annually in parking tickets issued on the Stanford
campus?"
"No ... uh ... I can't tell you that."
"Well, could you tell me what the money is used for?"
"Uh . . . no, I can't tell you that."
Okay, great, you've been very helpful.
Dear Bug Me,
Who is Dr. Demento really and how old is he? How long
has he been demented?
-Anonymous
I wasn't able to talk to the demented one himself, so all

of this is second-hand information. He might have been a
little sensitive about this kind of question anyway.
I did talk to the people at Imaginary Entertainment
Company, who act as agents for Dr. Demento (and also
"Weird Al" Yankovic). They told me that Dr. Demento's
real name is Barret Hansen, and he is now celebrating his
50th year as Dr. Demento. He has released a new album
to commemorate the occasion.
The gentleman I talked to didn't know exactly how old
the doctor is, but did say that he's middle-aged.
Dear Bug Me,
What Joes G.O.P. stand for, in the political party sense?
-Anonymous
I've tried and tried to keep politics out of this column,
but it just seems to rear its ugly head everywhere.
G.O.P. is a common nickname for the Republican
Party. According to the Encyclopedia Americana, the
name dates from the presidential election of 1896. At the
time of that election, the United States had a Democratic
president, and was mired in the depths of a serious de
pression. The Republican candidate, William Mckinley,
was elected overwhelmingly, along with Republican
majorities in both houses of Congress.
A period of recovery followed close on the heels of the
election, and grateful Americans nicknamed the
Republicans the "Grand Old Party." The name stuck, and
is now more commonly abbreviated, to G.O.P.
It's a pretty erroneous nickname in reality. The Demo
cratic Party is actually much older than the Republican
Party (which was formed just before the Civil War), and
the question of grandness is certainly a subjective judge
ment. But I don't want to generate too "inch hate mail, so
I'll just leave it at that.
