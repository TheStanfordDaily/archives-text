## Stanford smashed by Long Beach State 49ers win five of the six singles matches to clinch it early 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The subtitle to the Stanford Tennis Stadium
reads "Home of the Champions". Yesterday after
noon, however, it was the visiting Long Beach State
49ers who made themselves right at home.
The 16th-ranked 49ers played like champions by
winning five out of the six singles matches en-route
to a convincing 6-2 victory over the Cardinal.
"In the last 15 years, I don't remember getting
beat in singles this badly more than four or five
times," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said in the af
termath.
Long Beach Coach Larry Easley's team was led
by two freshmen who were outmatched in the ex
perience department, but not on the court.
Freshmen Richard Bergh and Greg Failla were
matched in the No. 1 and 2 singles against two of
the top regarded seniors in the nation, Stanford's
Dan Goldie and Jim Grabb. Unfortunately for
Stanford, the two newcomers played as if they had
the experience.
In a battle between two thin men (one spectator
said of Failla, "I'll bet a strong wind would blow
that kid right off the court"), Failla continually
pressed a listless Grabb to post a 6-4, 6-3 victory.
And in the last singles match to be completed,
the Swedish Bergh held off a comeback attempt by
Goldie to clinch the team victory with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-
3 win.
"There's no question that the No. 2 match
was the key," Easley said after the match. "That
kid (Failla) is only a freshman — usually he plays
fourth but he's been playing well so I moved him
up."
That last remark was given with a devious smile,
as if to say "Good move, eh?" In fact, the only 49er
who wasn't smiling yesterday was senior Peter
Smith.
Smith fell victim to Stanford's Patrick McEnroe,
who ran his singles record to a perfect 10-0 on the
year.
McEnroe, who is currently ranked 43rd in the
nation, blanked Smith in the first set and then
fought through the second set to take the No. 3

singles match 6-0, 6-2.
"Patrick played exceptionally well today,"
Gould said.
Several 49ers also put in some excellent perfor
mances yesterday. In the No. 4 singles
match, 69th-ranked Craig Miller defeated Stan
ford's Eric Rosenfeld 6-2, 6-2 to record the first
Long Beach victory of the day.
Vince Horcasitas quickly followed Miller's lead
and beat Cardinal Scott Moody in straight sets 6-2,
6-4.

Long Beach State 6, Stanford 2
Richard Bergh (LB) d. Dan Goldie 6-4,
3-6, 6-3.
Greg Failla (LB) d. Jim Grabb 6-4, 6-3.
Patrick McEnroe (S) d. Peter Smith 6-0,
6-2.
Craig Miller (LB) d. Eric Rosenfeld 6-2,
6-2.
Vince Horcasitas (LB) d. Scott Moody 2-6,
4-6.
Kevin Gillette (LB) d. Mark Jacobson 6-3,
7-6.
Goldie-Grabb (S) d. Bergh-Smith 7-5, 6-0
Miller-Gillette (LB) d. McEnroe and John
Letts 6-4, 7-6.

With their matches over, Miller and Horcasitas
turned to the sixth singles match and gave loud vo
cal support to their team captain Kevin Gillette.
At that point, Gillette was battling a strong come
back run by Cardinal junior Mark Jacobson. Gil
lette had won the first set and led the second 3-0
before Jacobson charged back to force a tie
breaker.
The captain ended up being the last one to take
charge, as he took the tie-breaker 7-3, and the
match 6-3, 7-6.
With the match already clinched, the doubles

play was only a formality. In the first doubles, the
Cardinal team of Goldie and Grabb rebounded to
defeat Bergh and Smith 7-5, 6-0.
Long Beach took the second doubles match as
Miller and Gillette defeated McEnroe and John
Letts 6-4, 7-6.
The third doubles match was called off while in
progress.
As far as the participants in yesterday's action
were concerned, the Long Beach victory was no big
surprise.
"We knew we had a good enough chance to take
the whole match," Gillette said. "1 mean we did
only lose to USC and UCLA 5-4. But we weren't
expecting to take the No. 2 singles. Our freshman
(Failla) did a great job."
Easley agreed. "We had come really close to
beating USC and UCLA, but on the other hand, we
had a couple of awful losses to Alabama and Har
vard last week. I guess we have a team that can
really play well, and today we did just that."
Gould also had to agree. "We just plain got beat
by a better team today. They're strengthened a lot
with Bergh and Failla, and Horcasitas really im
proved this year."
But Gould also had some things to say about his
own team's performance.
"I don't think we played tenaciously in the No. 2
singles, and I think we played carelessly in both the
No. 1 and 2 matches," he said.
With USC and UCLA coming to the Farm this
weekend, one might think that Stanford was
looking past Long Beach.
"Look, we have four seniors on the team,"
Gould said. "You can't say we're looking ahead."
As far as the rest of Stanford's season goes,
Gould had these words to say. "This team has the
potential to win the national championship. But I
think it's going to depend on how tough we are
mentally.
"When it's a beautiful day, your girlfriend loves
you, you got a 90 on a test and an A in another
class — then it's easy to play good tennis," he said.
"But when those things are going wrong — that's
when you have to get tough and keep your head up
on the court. I think we're getting better at that."
