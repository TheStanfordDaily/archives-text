# Gators bite Cardinal in ninth
## Double gives S.F. State a 6-5 win over the Six-Pac leaders 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO — If the mem
bers of Stanford's fourth-ranked
baseball team thought yesterday's
non-conference game with perennial
pushover San Francisco State would
be a cakewalk, they were April fools.
The joke was on Stanford, as the
Gators of the Northern California
Athletic Conference used seven
(count 'em, seven) pitchers and clutch
hitting to upend the Pacific 10 South
ern Division-leading Cardinal 6-5 in
a thriller at San Francisco State's
Maloney Field.
The loss dropped the Cardinal's
overall record to 21-10. The team's
non-conference record moved to 14-
7. The Gators, currently second in the
NCAC, posted their 12th win of the
season against 10 losses.
Cold winds were whipping across
the field on the bright and blustery
afternoon, but Stanford starter Rob
Wassenaar came out with a hot arm.
The junior righthander mixed a
snappy fastball with a wicked array of
breaking pitches to strike out four
Gators through two innings.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal batters
used a couple hits and some San
Francisco State generosity to stake
Wassenaar to a 2-0 lead in the top of

the second. Gator starter Greg Olsen
walked Mark Davis to start the in
ning, and Mike Deßenon followed
with a sharp single to left. The Card
inal then ran a double steal, with
Davis scoring when Gator catcher
Brian Letofsky's throw went into left
field.
First baseman Doug Robbins
knocked in the second run with a
nifty one-hop ground-rule double
over the right-center field fence.
Wassenaar picked up his fifth
strikeout to open the bottom of the
third, and looked to be rolling
through another easy inning when he
induced George Edge to bounce to
first. Robbins bobbled the ball,
though, and after Ilidio Freitas layed
down a perfect drag-bunt single, the
Gators had the go-ahead run at the
plate in the person of third baseman
Pete Dearborn.
Wassenaar put a fastball in Dear
born's wheelhouse, and the Gator un
corked a towering home run over the
right field fence to put San Francisco
State in the lead 3-2.
The Cardinal evened the score in
the fourth on a walk to Davis, an
other Robbins double and a wild
pitch by Gator reliever Alan
Gravenkamp.
Freshman Steve Chitren replaced
Wassenaar in the fifth. He walked the
leadoff hitter, Edge, who came

around to score on a double by the
fearsome Dearborn, putting the
Gators ahead 4-3.
The revolving door on the San
Francisco State bullpen continued to
spin, with the Gators' fourth pitcher,
Don Heinz, taking the mound in the
sixth. Pitching to his twin brother,
catcher Ron, Heinz quickly got him
self in trouble by walking Davis and
Deßenon. Heinz gave way to Marty
Markrack, and after a double steal,
the Cardinal was able to scratch
Markrack for the tying run on a
sacrifice fly by Robbins.
Dearborn struck again in the
seventh, lashing a double into the left
field corner. He came scampering
home on Joe Morrison's check-swing
bloop single to right, once again put
ting the Gators in the lead 5-4.
Stanford threatened in the eighth
when Davis, looking like a registered
charity case all day, collected his
fourth straight base on balls. Robbins
singled Davis to second, but the rally
fizzled without any score.
Things were looking grim for Stan
ford in the top of the ninth. The
seventh Gator pitcher, Franz
Gonzales, walked second baseman
Mark Machtolf to open the frame,
but proceeded to strike out shortstop
Frank Carey and third baseman
Ruben Amaro. Pinch runner Walt
Harris moved to second on a passed

ball, and then Toi Cook delivered a
clutch single to right to tie the game
at 6-6.
San Francisco State took little time
before ending the suspense in the
bottom of the ninth. Batting against
the Cradinal's third pitcher, Kevin
Kunkel, Gator Dean Williams led off
with a ground-rule double into the
bushes outside the left field fence.
Kunkel intentionally walked Mor
rison to bring up first baseman Clay
Purcell.
Purcell stroked a sinking liner into
right. Right fielder Deßenon, or
dinarily the Cardinal's designated hit
ter, dove for the ball but couldn't
make the catch. The ball bounced to
the fence and Williams cruised home
with the winning run. He was greeted
at the plate by a pack of jubilant
Gators, celebrating their David-like
defeat of the Cardinal.
"It's exciting to beat a class team
like Stanford," Dearborn said. "But
we just tried to make the routine
plays today."
Gator Coach Mike Simpson
downplayed the upset quality of the
victory.
"We took the same approach as if
it was any other non-league game,"
Simpson said. "I want my players to
believe they can beat anybody."
San Francisco State made believers
of the Cardinal yesterday.


Stanford whiffed on its attempt to win its 22nd game of the season,
losing 6-5 to San Francisco State. The defeat was the 10th of the year for
the Pacific 10 Southern Division leaders. A single by Toi Cook in the

ninth tied the game for the Cardinal, but the Gators won it in the bot
tom of the inning. Stanford meets second-place UCLA in a crucial Six-
Pac series this weekend in Los Angeles.
