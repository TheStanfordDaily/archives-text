# Davis interviewed for Iowa position
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
It is beginning to look more and
more like Stanford Coach Tom
Davis will not become the next
basketball coach at the University
of Houston, but the chances of his
remaining at Stanford are not
much higher, either.
On Monday, Davis went to the
University of lowa to interview for
the job vacated when George
Raveling was hired by USC. Davis
and his family flew to Wisconsin
late Monday, where they will take
a one-week vacation while Davis
decides what to do if he is offered
the Hawkeye job.
The San Jose Mercury News,
citing* sources "close to the situa
tion," reported yesterday that
Davis had in fact decided to turn
down the Houston offer made last
week. Neither Davis nor Athletic
Director Andy Geiger, who talked
to Davis Monday, has confirmed
that report.
Although both Athletic Direc
tor Thomas Ford and Houston
Board of Regents member Don
Sanders remained optimistic, it
appears that Davis is shying away
from Houston because of rumors

concerning an upcoming NCAA
investigation of the school. Also,
the Houston Athletic Department
is suffering from financial difficul
ties (a $3.1 million debt).
lowa would seem to be appeal
ing to Davis because it is in a
strong conference (the Big 10), it
has no problems with the NCAA
and its coach usually makes about
$200,000 annually after shoe con
tracts, camps and radio and televi
sion deals. Davis' current income
is estimated at $ 125,000.
Still, as Geiger said, "He's still
Stanford's basketball coach until I
hear otherwise."
In the event that Davis does
leave, Geiger has begun to inquire
about coaching candidates, of
which there are about six or eight.
Geiger has declined to identify
them.
Along with Davis, other
rumored candidates for the lowa
job include Gene Bartow of
Alabama-Birmingham, Missouri's
Norm Stewart and Pepperdine's
Jim Harrick.
When asked by the Mercury
News whether Davis was a top
candidate. lowa Athletic Director
Bump Elliott said, "His being here
should indicate that."
