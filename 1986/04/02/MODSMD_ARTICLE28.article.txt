### 
Synch Swimming
Though only fielding a club-level team, the
Stanford synchronized swimming team battled
the nation's best varsity teams and finished
third at the national championships March 20-
22 in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
Perennial-champion Ohio State captured
the title with 93 points. Arizona took second
place with 88 points, and the Cardinal fol
lowed with 65 points.
Stanford's third-place performance was not
only the Cardinal's highest finish ever but it
represented a turning point in collegiate
synchronized swimming. For the past 10
seasons, Ohio State, the University of Arizona
and Michigan had comprised the top three
teams at the championships, but this season
the Cardinal was able to edge Michigan.
Freshman Dee Cohen and sophomore
Leslie Tackett performed brilliantly for the
Cardinal throughout the competition. Both
earned All-American honors, which go to the
nation's top 14 swimmers. Cohen was the only
freshman to receive such honors.

Stanford won the compulsory figures, and
Tackett and Cohen finished third and fourth,
respectively, in the solo competition.
The atmosphere became tense in the duet
competition when Ohio State's coach was suc
cessful in stacking the judging panel.
After Cohen and Tackett surprised the
spectators by finishing in first place during the
preliminary round, the Buckeye coach re
quested the addition of two judges to the five
person panel. A majority of the coaches
agreed, and two judges — one a parent of an
Ohio State swimmer and the other an Arizona
supporter — were added.
Ir the final competition, Cohen and Tackett
were dropped to third place behind the Ohio
State and Arizona duet teams. Discarding the
scores from the additional judges, the Stan
ford pair would have finished in first place.
Jeri Lane joined Cohen and Tackett in the
trio competition, and the Cardinal placed
fourth.
The team category, a question mark for
Stanford all season, turned out to be a key fac
tor in the Cardinal's third-place overall finish.

Stanford's eight-person entry, led by Lane,
took seventh place in the team competition.
Ice Hockey
The Stanford ice hockey team traveled to
sunny Hawaii during spring break, but, despite
John Zierk's five-goal effort, the Cardinal
continued to slump, dropping two games to a
Hawaiian military all-star team.
"We should have won both games, but we
just played really badly," Scott Bommer said.
"They were pretty good, though."
The military team edged the Cardinal 5-4
on March 23 and came back to win 10-8 the
following day.
Zierk scored twice in the first game and
added a hat trick and two assists in the second
loss.
Back at home, Stanford must defeat San
Jose State Friday in order to qualify for the
final spot in the California and Nevada
Hockey League playoffs being held Saturday
and Sunday in Reno, Nev.

Ultimate Frisbee
Determined to improve on last year's disap
pointing finish in the collegiate national cham
pionships and regain the form which led to its
1984 national title, the Stanford men's ul
timate frisbee team begins a busy spring
season this weekend at Davis.
Ranked fourth in the pre-season Ultimate
Players' Association Top 20, the Cardinal has
been competing the past two quarters, but
spring quarter represents the bulk of the
team's competition.
This year's squad is deeper and more
balanced than the one which struggled at last
year's championships. Returning starters
Glenn Baker, Peter Hecht, Sandy Koonce,
Peter Lyon, Wes Monroe and Scott Smal
lwood will be joined by new prospects Will
Flan, Spencer Haywood, Jim Micholsen and
Peter Shaman.
April 12 and 13 Stanford will host the Hal
ley's Comet Open, which will feature many of
the best open and collegiate teams in the
West.
