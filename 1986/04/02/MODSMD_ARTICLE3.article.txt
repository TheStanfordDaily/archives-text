# Coffee House seeks tax refund
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
The Coffee House, Inc. (CHI) on Monday retained a legal counsel to assist
in its efforts to recover over $93,000 in sales taxes the Coffee House claims it
unnecessarily paid to the state, according to Senate Chair Carey White.
The firm of Blase Valentine and Klein will try to arrange a hearing with the
State Board of Equalization, which would decide whether CHI is entitled to a
tax refund, he said.
White added that in late March, the ASSU-owned corporation repaid the
$26,906.26 it owed to Tresidder Memorial Union. Some of the debts had been
outstanding for over a year, according to Nancy Howe, assistant director of
Tresidder Union.
The student managers who began operating the Coffee House after its incor
poration in 1980 "didn't know they didn't have to pay or collect sales tax" on
approximately 70 percent of sales, according to White.
Food services are exempted from paying sales tax if they are run by student
organizations, Howe said.
White added that taxes do not have to be paid on any meal bought by either
Stanford students or faculty.
According to Tresidder studies conducted during CHl's operation, 70 per
cent of all sales were to students and faculty.
It was not until March 1985 that CHI discovered it did not owe the state a
large percentage of the "tens of thousands of dollars a year" it paid in sales tax,
according to White.
White primarily charged the accountants who handled CHl's finances for
the mistake. However, "you can't totally blame the accountants," White said,
"The people involved should have known too."
The laws describing when businesses such as CHI are required to pay taxes
are "not well known," Howe said, adding that the error "may have been noth
ing more than an oversight."
CHI began filing a claim with the state for a refund soon after the error was
discovered. White said.
But due to a three-year statute of limitations, CHI can only be compensated
for extra taxes paid since 1982. The total CHI claim amounts to $93,775.85,
White said.
In addition, CHI stopped paying tax on 70 percent of all sales after March
1985, White said, adding that the corporation held all money that would have
been turned over in taxes in reserve.
According to White, from April to September 1985, when its contract with
Tresidder Union expired, CHI set aside $15,818.00.
Terming CHl's actions "a gamble," since it never told the state of its plans,
White said, "We just decided not to pay 70 percent of tax on sales." The state,
however, did nothing.
After the state cleared its account in March 1986, CHI used the money it
had put into reserve and, combining it with the approximately $12,000 it had
remaining after settling its other debts, repaid Tresidder Union, White said.
While it did not take action against CHI for withholding the extra sales tax,
the state in January denied the corporation's request for a refund.
CHI decided to retain the legal services of Blase Valentine and Klein after
consultations with the Legal Counseling Office, White said.
Besides arranging a hearing with the State Board of Equalization, the firm
will argue the case for CHI,
