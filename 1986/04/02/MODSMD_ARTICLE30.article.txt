U.S. rejects dialogue with Khadafi
WASHINGTON — In advance of Vice President George Bush's trip
to Saudi Arabia, Libyan leader Moammar Khadafi sent two emissaries
to Riyadh in an apparent attempt to try once again to open a dialogue
with Washington in the wake of the U.S.-Libyan confrontation last week
in the Gulf of Sidra.
Administration officials said they have no intention of responding to
Khadafi's latest overture through the Saudis. They added that they have
also rebuffed half a dozen other attempts by Libya to make contact with
the United States through various European and Arab channels follow
ing the Dec. 27 terrorist attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports.
Saudi King Fahd talked to Khadafi on the phone the day after the first
American attack on Libyan military targets Mar. 24. Fahd subsequently
told U.S. officials that the Libyan leader appeared deeply affected by the
American use of force against him and the king described Khadafi as
"incomprehensible and disoriented" on the telephone, according to one
Administration source.
The would-be European and Arab mediators, including King Fahd
himself, were firmly told in January that the Administration was not in
terested either in "a direct or indirect dialogue" with Khadafi, according
to the source.
The same message will be given to the Saudis again if the king brings
up the issue during his talks with Bush, the official said.
Bush is scheduled to arrive Saturday in Saudi Arabia on the first leg of
a trip to the Persian Gulf region that will also take him to Bahrain,
Oman and North Yemen. The main purpose of his trip is to reaffirm a
continuing American commitment to the countries of the Arabian
peninsula in the wake of the latest military gains by Iran in its war
against neighboring Iraq.
At a news conference yesterday. Bush said he also is expected to be
asked during his trip about the Administration's attitude toward the
Libyan leader and was ready to tell anyone who asked "right directly
how strongly we feel about Khadafi, what a menace he is."
Soviets seek new summit meeting
MOSCOW — Since the November summit meeting in Geneva be
tween President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet
officials repeatedly have evoked "the spirit of Geneva" as the formula
for improved U.S.-Soviet relations.
During the past month, in Moscow's view, the "spirit" has taken a
beating — in Libya, Nicaragua, in the Black Sea and in the Nevada des
ert.
But so far, despite the harsh words, the Soviets have refused to give up
on prospects for a dialogue with Washington, and most observers here
expect that Gorbachev eventually will follow through with the next sum
mit meeting in Washington.
This point was reinforced here yesterday in a press conference by
Georgi Kornienko, the Kremlin's first deputy foreign minister.
In spite of recent actions by Washington, Kornienko said the Soviets
remain interested in a summit this year. He said Gorbachev's call on Sat
urday for an immediate meeting with Reagan in Europe to discuss a nu
clear test ban was not intended to replace a full-scale summit later.
"Gorbachev did not mean that this meeting, if it took place, would
supplant the summit meeting, which he had agreed upon in Geneva and
which would be a visit by Gorbachev to Washington,"he said.
Asked whether the recent U.S. military confrontation with Soviet ally
Libya or other Reagan Administration actions tested the Kremlin's pa
tience, Kornienko said, "We are looking upon these actions as defiant
and provocative," and they contradict "the spirit of Geneva."
French observers pull out of Beirut
PARIS — France announced yesterday the withdrawal of its 45
remaining cease-fire observers in Beirut, prompting speculation that the
new conservative government in Paris could be launching a fresh policy
in Lebanon.
"The evolvement of the situation there no longer allows (the obser
vers) to fulfill their mission as it should be," the External Relations Min
istry said. The withdrawal took place yesterday, it said.
Earlier, Beirut newspaper reports quoted French Ambassador Chris
tian Graeff as having informed Lebanese Prime Minister Rashid Karami
of the decision to end the force's presence in Beirut.
The reports said the observers were at their headquarters along
Beirut's "Green Line" and would be evacuated from Lebanon over the
coming days.
News of the withdrawal provoked almost immediate speculation in the
French press of a realignment of its Lebanese policy by the government
of new Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, although no official word on this
was forthcoming.
The 45 observers who left their posts yesterday were the remainder of
an 80-member force dispatched two years ago to monitor truce viola
tions between rival Christian and Moslem militias along the Green Line
and in the hills just outside Beirut.
Peres asks West to aid Middle East
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in a con
ciliatory gesture to his Arab neighbors, said yesterday that Western in
dustrial nations should donate some of their savings from falling oil
prices to economic projects in financially pressed Middle East countries.
Peres, holding a press conference after meetings with Vice President
George Bush and Secretary of State George Shultz, said that oil
consuming nations would save as much as $100 billion this year as a
result of falling prices. He said that some of those savings should be in
vested "in the stability of the countries in the region."
It was learned that Peres suggested a 10-year, $25 billion program to
assist Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, the four Arab countries bor
dering on Israel. None of the four is a major oil producer, but Jordan,
Lebanon and Syria have received economic aid from Saudi Arabia and
other oil exporters that may dry up because of the declining oil market.
The Peres plan is understood to suggest projects for such peaceful
purposes as infrastructure development, pollution abatement and
tourism development. It was learned that he had earlier outlined the
plan to Western European and Japanese officials.
A State Department official was non-committal about the proposal.
"All we've said is we'll look at it,"he said.
Peres is known to think that Israel's chances of making peace with its
neighbors would be improved if they were not on the edge of economic
ruin. But it is not clear if the Arab states would accept programs openly
advocated by the Jerusalem government.
Violence intensifies in N. Ireland
LONDON — An increase in violence was reported throughout much
of Northern Ireland yesterday, following extensive battles between
militant protestants and police in the town of Portadown, 13 miles
southwest of Belfast.
Reports said about 50 protesters were injured in the clashes, during
which police fired plastic bullets at a crowd of some 3,000 persons who
gathered at 2 a.m. in defiance of a government ban of a planned march
Monday by 20.000 protestants through the town.
Street fighting spread from Portadown to other Northern Irish cities,
including Belfast, where protesters hijacked and set fire to a number of
city buses and private cars.
Leading the demonstration through a mainly Roman Catholic area of
Portadown was the Rev. Lan Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Uni
onist Party.
Paisley decried the protest ban as a result of the recent Anglo-Irish ac
cord giving the Irish Republic a say in the running of British-ruled
Northern Ireland's affairs.

George Bush and Secretary of State George Shultz, said that oil
consuming nations would save as much as $100 billion this year as a
result of falling prices. He said that some of those savings should be in
vested "in the stability of the countries in the region."
It was learned that Peres suggested a 10-year, $25 billion program to
assist Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, the four Arab countries bor
dering on Israel. None of the four is a major oil producer, but Jordan,
Lebanon and Syria have received economic aid from Saudi Arabia and
other oil exporters that may dry up because of the declining oil market.
The Peres plan is understood to suggest projects for such peaceful
purposes as infrastructure development, pollution abatement and
tourism development. It was learned that he had earlier outlined the
plan to Western European and Japanese officials.
A State Department official was non-committal about the proposal.
"All we've said is we'll look at it,"he said.
Peres is known to think that Israel's chances of making peace with its
neighbors would be improved if they were not on the edge of economic
ruin. But it is not clear if the Arab states would accept programs openly
advocated by the Jerusalem government.
Violence intensifies in N. Ireland
LONDON — An increase in violence was reported throughout much
of Northern Ireland yesterday, following extensive battles between
militant protestants and police in the town of Portadown, 13 miles
southwest of Belfast.
Reports said about 50 protesters were injured in the clashes, during
which police fired plastic bullets at a crowd of some 3,000 persons who
gathered at 2 a.m. in defiance of a government ban of a planned march
Monday by 20.000 protestants through the town.
Street fighting spread from Portadown to other Northern Irish cities,
including Belfast, where protesters hijacked and set fire to a number of
city buses and private cars.
Leading the demonstration through a mainly Roman Catholic area of
Portadown was the Rev. Lan Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Uni
onist Party.
Paisley decried the protest ban as a result of the recent Anglo-Irish ac
cord giving the Irish Republic a say in the running of British-ruled
Northern Ireland's affairs.
U.S. rejects dialogue with Khadafi
WASHINGTON — In advance of Vice President George Bush's trip
to Saudi Arabia, Libyan leader Moammar Khadafi sent two emissaries
to Riyadh in an apparent attempt to try once again to open a dialogue
with Washington in the wake of the U.S.-Libyan confrontation last week
in the Gulf of Sidra.
Administration officials said they have no intention of responding to
Khadafi's latest overture through the Saudis. They added that they have
also rebuffed half a dozen other attempts by Libya to make contact with
the United States through various European and Arab channels follow
ing the Dec. 27 terrorist attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports.
Saudi King Fahd talked to Khadafi on the phone the day after the first
American attack on Libyan military targets Mar. 24. Fahd subsequently
told U.S. officials that the Libyan leader appeared deeply affected by the
American use of force against him and the king described Khadafi as
"incomprehensible and disoriented" on the telephone, according to one
Administration source.
The would-be European and Arab mediators, including King Fahd
himself, were firmly told in January that the Administration was not in
terested either in "a direct or indirect dialogue" with Khadafi, according
to the source.
The same message will be given to the Saudis again if the king brings
up the issue during his talks with Bush, the official said.
Bush is scheduled to arrive Saturday in Saudi Arabia on the first leg of
a trip to the Persian Gulf region that will also take him to Bahrain,
Oman and North Yemen. The main purpose of his trip is to reaffirm a
continuing American commitment to the countries of the Arabian
peninsula in the wake of the latest military gains by Iran in its war
against neighboring Iraq.
At a news conference yesterday. Bush said he also is expected to be
asked during his trip about the Administration's attitude toward the
Libyan leader and was ready to tell anyone who asked "right directly
how strongly we feel about Khadafi, what a menace he is."
Soviets seek new summit meeting
MOSCOW — Since the November summit meeting in Geneva be
tween President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet
officials repeatedly have evoked "the spirit of Geneva" as the formula
for improved U.S.-Soviet relations.
During the past month, in Moscow's view, the "spirit" has taken a
beating — in Libya, Nicaragua, in the Black Sea and in the Nevada des
ert.
But so far, despite the harsh words, the Soviets have refused to give up
on prospects for a dialogue with Washington, and most observers here
expect that Gorbachev eventually will follow through with the next sum
mit meeting in Washington.
This point was reinforced here yesterday in a press conference by
Georgi Kornienko, the Kremlin's first deputy foreign minister.
In spite of recent actions by Washington, Kornienko said the Soviets
remain interested in a summit this year. He said Gorbachev's call on Sat
urday for an immediate meeting with Reagan in Europe to discuss a nu
clear test ban was not intended to replace a full-scale summit later.
"Gorbachev did not mean that this meeting, if it took place, would
supplant the summit meeting, which he had agreed upon in Geneva and
which would be a visit by Gorbachev to Washington,"he said.
Asked whether the recent U.S. military confrontation with Soviet ally
Libya or other Reagan Administration actions tested the Kremlin's pa
tience, Kornienko said, "We are looking upon these actions as defiant
and provocative," and they contradict "the spirit of Geneva."
French observers pull out of Beirut
PARIS — France announced yesterday the withdrawal of its 45
remaining cease-fire observers in Beirut, prompting speculation that the
new conservative government in Paris could be launching a fresh policy
in Lebanon.
"The evolvement of the situation there no longer allows (the obser
vers) to fulfill their mission as it should be," the External Relations Min
istry said. The withdrawal took place yesterday, it said.
Earlier, Beirut newspaper reports quoted French Ambassador Chris
tian Graeff as having informed Lebanese Prime Minister Rashid Karami
of the decision to end the force's presence in Beirut.
The reports said the observers were at their headquarters along
Beirut's "Green Line" and would be evacuated from Lebanon over the
coming days.
News of the withdrawal provoked almost immediate speculation in the
French press of a realignment of its Lebanese policy by the government
of new Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, although no official word on this
was forthcoming.
The 45 observers who left their posts yesterday were the remainder of
an 80-member force dispatched two years ago to monitor truce viola
tions between rival Christian and Moslem militias along the Green Line
and in the hills just outside Beirut.
Peres asks West to aid Middle East
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in a con
ciliatory gesture to his Arab neighbors, said yesterday that Western in
dustrial nations should donate some of their savings from falling oil
prices to economic projects in financially pressed Middle East countries.

George Bush and Secretary of State George Shultz, said that oil
consuming nations would save as much as $100 billion this year as a
