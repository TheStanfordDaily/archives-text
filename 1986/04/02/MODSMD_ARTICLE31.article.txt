# OSHA fines Union Carbide
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Citing what it called a
"willful disregard for health and safety," the Labor
Department yesterday fined Union Carbide Corp.
a record $1,377,700 for 221 alleged safety viola
tions at the company's Institute, W.Va., plant and
gave its files to the Justice Department for possible
criminal prosecution.
Investigators for the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) charge that
Carbide used some plant workers as human
"canaries" to detect deadly phosgene gas by sniff
ing the air without respirators.
OSHA also charged that Carbide:
• "Intentionally" underreported the number of
workers' injuries at the plant, which agency offi
cials described as a possible violation of federal
criminal law.
• Maintained "defective" safety equipment that
increased the threat of fires and explosions and
workers' exposure to toxic chemicals.
• Failed to install monitoring devices to detect
leaks of chlorine, carbon monoxide and other dan
gerous chemicals at the plant.
The fines, by far the stiffest ever imposed by
OSHA, resulted from a "wall-to-wall" investiga
tion of the plant after a toxic cloud of aldicarb
oxide leaked from the facility Aug. 11, 1985, and

sent more than 130 people to the hospital.
In a statement from the firm's Danbury, Conn.,
headquarters Carbide President Robert Kennedy
said that OSHA had "grossly distorted" safety con
ditions at the plant and that the company will
vigorously contest the allegations.
"Most of the alleged violations involved paper
work, not chemical process safety, operating in
tegrity or employee safety," Kennedy said.
"Furthermore, the allegation of complacency with
respect to safety is an outrageous misrepresenation
of the truth."
Labor Secretary William Brock said the findings
showed a "laissez-faire attitude" toward worker
safety that has spurred OSHA to conduct more in
tensive investigations at other toxic chemical plants
across the country. But Brock said the Institute
plant "appears to be far worse than others."
"We just were surprised to find conscious, overt,
willful violations on such a widespread basis,"
Brock said. "I can't say there are not other people
(in the chemical industry) playing the same kind of
games. I can say we are aggressively trying to find
out."
Carbide has 15 days to file an appeal, which
would go first to an administrative law judge, then
to a three-member OSHA review commission and,

if necessary, to a federal appeals court.
The plant, west of the state capital of Charleston,
has been a focus of national controversy since the
Dec. 2, 1984, disaster in Bhopal, India, when a leak
of deadly methyl isocyanate (MIC) from a Carbide
plant there killed more than 2,000 people and
injured thousands more.
The Institute plant, designed identically to the
Bhopal unit, was the only U.S. facility producing
MIC.
Brock and other OSHA officials stressed that
yesterday's violations did not involve the MIC or
aldicarb units, which have been the subject of sepa
rate, earlier probes by the agency. A separate in
vestigation of the aldicarb unit led OSHA last fall
to cite Carbide for $32,100 in fines— a figure that
Carbide lawyers have negotiated down to $4,400.
OSHA officials said the new investigation in
volved five other units at the plant and resulted in
more damaging findings, including 130 "willful" vi
olations of federal safety standards and 72 more
termed "serious."
OSHA assessed $10,000 for each "willful" viola
tion and $1,000 for each "serious" one, and a total
of $5,700 for 19 remaining violations. The highest
fine imposed previously by OSHA was $786,190
against Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock
Co. in 1979, later reduced to $96,580.
