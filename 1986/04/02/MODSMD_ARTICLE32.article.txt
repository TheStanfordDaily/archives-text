# Seven Americans may be dead in crash
## 
### 
MORELIA, Mexico — At least
seven Americans and two Canadians
are believed to be among the 166
persons killed when a Mexicana
Airlines jet plowed into a mountain
and exploded in a giant fireball
shortly after takeoff from Mexico
City Monday.
Officials said that Mexicana Flight
940, carrying 158 passengers and a
crew of eight to two Pacific Coast
resorts and Los Angeles, apparently
lost altitude rapidly after taking off
from Mexico City's Benito Juarez In
ternational Airport and struck a
remote hillside in the Sierra Madres,
about 90 miles northwest of the capi
tal.
The Mexican Red Cross and others
among the first to reach the hilly,
wooded crash site said there were no
signs of survivors.
Anibal Silva, spokesman for the
federal Department of Communica
tions and Transportation, said
wreckage was scattered over a 1.5-
mile area and that the bodies of pas

sengers "were in pieces."
"The nose and the tail of the plane
were found 2 kilometers (1.2 miles)
apart," Silva said in a telephone in
terview. "All indications are that
there are no survivors."
Rescue workers said that only the
plane's tail section was intact and that
bodies could be seen on a moun
tainside and in a valley strewn with
wreckage.
Hours after the crash, what was left
of Flight 940 was still burning and a
white plume of smoke hundreds of
feet high could be seen from a mile
away.
The cause of the crash could not
immediately be determined. There
were unconfirmed reports by
Mexican television stations that the
Boeing 727-200 may have been
rocked by an explosion before plung
ing to earth.
Jose Luis Munoz, an official of
Mexico's Civil Aeronautic Adminis
tration, flew to the site by helicopter
and said that parts of the plane were

still burning and that some bodies
remained in the fuselage.
"Much of the plane had burned,"
Munoz said. "The midsection, which
is what I saw, had definitely burned.
You could see the tail section, and it
was the largest piece intact."
He said the wreckage was in a
heavily wooded area near the small
town of Maravatio, about 60 miles
northeast of here.
Abel Suarez, a pilot with the
Mexican attorney general's office,
said the airliner hit a small mountain
known as Las Crusitas, broke apart
and then rained debris down the
backside of the hill into a valley.
"There were pieces as far as I could
see," Suarez said.
At least 14 helicopters were ferry
ing rescue workers and Mexicana of
ficials from the new airport at
Morelia.
Mexicana officials said the flight
left Mexico City at 8:50 a.m. on a
daily run to Los Angeles with stops in
Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan.
Shortly after 9 a.m., Capt. Carlos

Guadarrama Sistos reported to the
control tower that he was losing alti
tude and requested that he be
allowed to return to Mexico City. He
reported an emergency but gave no
details.
According to a tower official,
Guadarrama was flying at 31,000 feet
when he requested permission to de
scend to 28,000. The control tower
authorized the pilot to go to 20,000
feet.
Soon after, communication was
abruptly cut off.
Mexicana spokesman Jose
Henonen said Guadarrama also had
reported a loss of cabin pressure.
Silva, the transportation depart
ment spokesman, said the investiga
tion will be conducted "with consid
erable haste," but he declined to
predict how long it will take. The
agency's last air crash investigation,
five years ago, took one month, he
said.
Mexicana officials reported that
the crash was the airline's first major
disaster in 17 years.
