Court limits confessions
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
placed new constitutional limits yesterday on the
use of criminal confessions, ruling 6-3 that police
may not question suspects who have asked for a
lawyer at an arraignment or other court proceed
ings.
The court affirmed two lower court decisions
invalidating incriminating statements made by
two Michigan murder defendants in police
initiated interrogations befoie they consulted
with counsel they had requested at their arraign
ments.
The fact that they had been informed of their
rights before the questioning made no difference,
the court said.
"If police initiate interrogation after a defen
dant's assertion, at an arraignment or similar
proceeding, of his right to counsel, any waiver of
(that right) for that police-initiated interrogation
is invalid," Justice John Stevens wrote for the
court. The decision was the latest in a series
flowing from the justices' landmark 1966 ruling
in Miranda vs. Arizona, requiring police to in
form suspects in custody of their rights to silence
and the presence of counsel before any interroga
tion may begin.
The justices expanded a 1981 decision based
on the Miranda ruling that said under the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,
once a suspect in custody has requested counsel
all questioning must stop unless and until the
accused himself initiates it.
The court said the reasons for limiting inter
rogation "are even stronger" after an accused has

been formally charged at arraignment and is then
guaranteed the right to assistance of counsel un
der the Sixth Amendment.
Sanctuary called illegal
TUCSON, Ariz. — The sanctuary movement,
a nationwide church-based effort to help Central
Americans illegally resettle in the United States,
is not an exercise in freedom of religion but a
criminal conspiracy, a federal prosecutor charged
yesterday.
"The drafters of the Constitution (and) the law
of this land do not permit people to engage in
criminal acts and then say it wps a religious exer
cise," U.S. Attorney Donald Reno, Jr. said in
closing arguments to the jury in the government's
widely publicized effort to break the sanctuary
movement here.
"Freedom of speech, freedom of religion,
freedom of association," Reno argued, "do not
immunize criminal conduct. There is no immu
nity under the First Amendment."
As he has since the trial began last October,
Reno continued to try to narrow the case to a
simple issue of smuggling illegal aliens into the
country.
His full day at the lectern in U.S. District
Court, during which some of the defendants ap
peared to be dozing, was salted with references to
"the smuggling act," "smuggling parlance,"
"criminal partnership" and"the conspiracy."
All 11 defendants, some of them the founders
of the nation's sanctuary movement, are charged
with conspiracy to violate U.S. immigration laws

by agreeing to help refugees from politically op
pressive Central American nations enter the
United States.
In addition, some are also charged with various
direct violations of immigration laws, a total of
30 felony and misdemeanor charges.
Airport staffers needed
WASHINGTON — Federal Aviation Admin
istration documents warn that a shortage of tech
nicians who maintain air traffic control facilities
and systems has become so severe that it could
jeopardize the nation's air system.
"Airway facilities staffing has diminished to a
critical level," according to internal FAA docu
ments made available yesterday. The documents,
dated Mar. 20, were prepared by the agency's of
fice of development and logistics for a recent
briefing of top FAA officials.
The papers warn that budget reductions in fis
cal 1986 and 1987 could seriously jeoparidze
"maintenance of the national airspace system."
Stock prices plummet
NEW YORK — Stock prices fell sharply yes
terday in a wave of profit-taking that analysts
said amounted to a normal correction after the
market's heavy recent gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
28.50 to 1790.11. Decliners outpaced gainers by
nearly two to one, as volume hit 167.39 million
shares the New York Stock Exchange.
