Black gives no defense
REDWOOD CITY, Calif. — Attorneys for
Robert Walker Black, who is accused of killing
his mother and uncle and stashing their rotting
bodies beneath his floor boards, rested their case
yesterday without calling any witnesses.
"Defendant Robert Black chooses not to pres
ent any witnesses at this time," said attorney Ed
Thirkell shortly after the case reconvened in San
Mateo County Superior Court.
Thirkell, who is under a court-imposed gag or
der, declined to comment on his strategy, the
latest twist in a bizarre case. He would not even
say whether he would present a closing argument
when court convenes tomorrow.
Black's attorneys previously indicated they in
tended to put on a psychological defense.
Leonor Black, whose tip led to the discovery of
the badly decomposed bodies in June 1984, was
jailed last week when she refused to testify
against Black. He is accused of killing his 74-

year-old mother, Agnes, and his 72-year-old
uncle, Isaac, in October 1980.
The court ruled Leonor Black was not legally
married to Black at the time of the killings be
cause her divorce from a previous marriage had
not been finalized. Judge John Bible jailed her
when she refused to take the stand.
Black has said in interviews with reporters that
he accidentally shot the two when he mistook
them for "hit men" sent to kill him. It is not clear
whether the jury will ever learn of those state
ments. Much of the prosecution's case was not
presented because of Black's refusal to tes
tify.
Roberti defends Bird
SACRAMENTO — At a Capitol press confer
ence, California Senate President Pro Tem David
Roberti (D-L.A.) repeated his support for em
battled California Chief Justice Rose Bird, again

defended Bradley for not taking a position on
Bird's reconfirmation by voters, and refused to
criticize Senate Democrats who have come out in
opposition to the chief justice.
"The senators are all big boys and big girls,"
Roberti said. "They know how to make their own
decisions. They want to reflect strongly the evi
dent position of their constituents. I understand
that."
Discussing Bradley's refusal to take a position
on Bird, Roberti claimed that he too would have
preferred to remain neutral on the court election
but supported Bird to "counterbalance those
who want to mix the court and politics together."
Today's weather
Once again, highs will be in the upper 70s and
it will be bright and sunny and cheerful and
happy and generally wonderful.
