# Berkeley police arrest 61 protesters
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
Sixty-one anti-aparthied demonstrators were arrested yester
day at UC-Berkeley after campus police tore down shanties
blocking entrances to administration offices.
Of those arrested, only 21 were Berkeley students, according
to UC-Berkeley spokesperson Tom Debley. No one was
seriously injured in the confrontation between protesters and
about 60 campus police.
According to Debley, the protesters were cited with mis
demeanors of trespassing and resisting arrest. All but two were
released, and the two refused to identify themselves, he said.
Demonstrators had blocked all entrances to California Hall
with 12 shanties that were built as a symbolic protest of the UC
system's $2.4 billion holdings in companies doing business with
South Africa. Two of the shanties were actually nailed to the
doors of the building, he said.
According to Debley, Kenneth Hernandez, the Berkeley
campus fire marshal, declared on Monday that California Hall
was "a severe fire hazard due to the combustible nature of the
shanties .. . (he) also declared the shanties were illegally block
ing entrances to the building."
Berkeley's Assistant Chancellor John Cummings met with the

demonstrators before the police moved in and warned them that
the fire marshal had declared the shantytown a fire hazard, ac
cording to the San Francisco Examiner. Cummings said the Uni
versity was willing to help erect a new one "at a mutually
agreeable location" that would be safer for all involved.
Berkeley officials set a 10 p.m. deadline Monday night for the
shanties to he removed, Debley said. When the demonstrators
refused to comply with the deadline, "the decision was made to
arrest those who refused to move," he said.
Several people barricaded themselves inside the shanties and
tried to beat back police with sticks that they poked through slats
in the structure's sides, he said.
"The situation was really rather serious. . . . The demonstra
tion that was made was blatantly confrontational and blatantly il
legal in terms of blockading the building," he said.
According to the Examiner, arrests were orderly until the near
end of the two-hour process when 20 protesters gathered in a
single remaining shanty that had not been torn down. When
police went in, several demonstrators were dragged out by their
hair, their heads banging against the pavement, according to the
witnesses who spoke to the Examiner.
As the buses heading for the county jail near Pleasanton were
departing with the arrestees, some protestors reacted violently
and pelted the vehicles with garbage and rocks. Demonstrators

also overturned metal trash containers and broke a window on a
police car.
"It was a pretty violent scene here," Ray Colvig, UC public in
formation officer, told the Examiner.
Anti-apartheid activists here expressed support for the
Berkeley demonstrators and dismay at the confrontation.
Steve Phillips, chairman of the Black Student Union, said of
the Berkeley demonstrators, "Their actions and commitment are
inspiring."
Marvin Jackson, a member of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA), said he feared the Berkeley incident will set a preced
ent.
"My first reaction was what is going to happen here at Stan
ford when we rebuild our shanty this quarter," Jackson said. "I
was really shocked that the Berkeley administration acted the
way it did. I hope that the Stanford administration reacts better."
A shantytown constructed by SOSA members in White Plaza
was demolished in February. Those who committed the act have
not been identified, although an anonymous letter to The Daily
claimed responsibility and attributed the destruction "to the ef
fects of 'magic mushrooms.' "
The shantytown was reconstructed out of stronger materials by
SOSA members the following week, only to be destroyed by a
rainstorm a day later. It has not been rebuilt.
