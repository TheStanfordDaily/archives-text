# Spring has sprung in the classrooms

golden tan. Gasses, of course, are
not to interfere with maximum
tanning hours — any class that
meets five times per week is one to

avoid, and afternoon classes are
almost worse than the plague.
However, not all Stanford stu
dents see spring as the quarter to
take a light load and bag rays. For
the most part, students treat spring
quarter no differently than any
other quarter.
Junior Sue Brventon said
she bases her class choice for
spring quarter "on a combination
of a lot of things — the professor, the
subject matter, what I've heard about
the class." Sometimes, Bryenton says,
she settles into her schedule a bit late
because, "It takes awhile to shop
around."
Professors, too, say they notice
little difference in students' attitudes
during spring quarter. One said,
"Spring quarter is just like any other
quarter."
And Prof. Mark Edwards of the
Classics Department said that stu
dents may take a little longer
"settling in" during spring quarter,
but not because they're searching for
an easy class.
"Students perhaps think more
seriosly" about their futures in the
spring, Edwards said, and this can
lead to some late decisions about
which classes they are going to take.
"[During spring quarter] freshmen
are more apt to think about their aca
demic futures, whether they're going
overseas, what they're going to major
in," he said.
"On the whole, students are begin
ning to have more questions concern
ing their academic careers" during
spring, according to Edwards.
Nevertheless, many students said
that they take decidedly non
academic factors into consideration
when they choose spring quarter

courses.
"I never take any class that meets
too early — and earlier than 9 a.m. is
too early," sophomore John Payne
said. "I don't take any late after
noon classes either."
Senior Joanna Burke also said she
weighs considerations differently
when choosing her spring classes.
"I always consider things like the
time of day and which days in the
week the class meets, but especially
so in spring quarter," Burke said. She
also claims that during spring quarter
there is often "competition among
my friends to see who is in class the
fewest hours."
On the whole, though, spring is just
another quarter for most students on
the Farm — academically, at least.
Freshman Hamilton Hunt, for ex
ample, has only one requirement for
any class that he considers.
"I just look for exciting classes," he
said. "If the class looks exciting, then
I'll take it." This quarter, according
to Hunt, Philosophy of Religion is
more "exciting" than Elementary
Economics.
Most students are purely practical
when mapping out their academic
schedules. "Mostly, I just take
classes that I'm interested in," said
Sophia Colamarino, a freshman. "I
also talk to other people about
classes."
Junior Randi McHarque, on the

other hand, said she takes other
students' opinions about a class with a
grain of salt. "I usually don't go by
what other people say about classes,"
she said. "Everybody's different."
Sophomore Paul Mahoney said
that class size and the time of day the
class meets are important considera
tions for him. "Of course, the topic of
the course is a consideration too," he
said.
Many students have very organized
systems that they implement to
choose their classes.
"I usually make a list of classes that
look interesting," senior Diana Sed
enquist said. "I try to take the inter
esting classes first, then I fit in classes
that I have to take."
Markus Wallgren, a sophomore,
said he has much of his schedule
for the next two years already
planned out.
"Usually, 1 try to take three or four
classes towards my major, a distribu
tion requirement and then whatever
else is available," he said.
Wallgren, who is majoring in elec
trical engineering, says he often
has little room for much else in his
schedule besides classes that fulfill his
major or a distribution requirement.
Most students, however, are not as
restricted as Wallgren in their class
choices.
"Usually, I just go to a class, and if
I like it, I take it," Payne says.
