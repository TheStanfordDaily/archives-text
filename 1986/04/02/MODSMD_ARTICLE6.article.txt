# GSB class explores space business
## 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
The Graduate School of Business
has launched one of the first courses
to consider the practical problems of
industrial development in outer
space.
The course, "Commercial Devel
opment of Space," is being taught this
quarter by Gayton Germane, a pro
fessor in the business school.
Major topics to be considered in
the course include the selection of
products and services suitable for
space exploitation, the design of busi
ness strategies for companies compet

ing in space and the resolution of
problems in international law that
may he caused by the unique charac
teristics of industry in space.
Previous courses offered by Stan
ford through the School of Engineer
ing have addressed technical prob
lems in the design and maintenance
of space projects, but none have dealt
directly with the problems that busi
ness will face as space ventures
become more important.
The issues confronting business in
outer space have also been addressed
by the Space Enterprise Club, a
group of students interested in ex
traterrestrial business issues. The club

has sponsored a tour of NASA's
Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, and has organized several
other field trips and lectures.
According to George Macpherson,
an organizer of the club, the structure
of the space industry in the United
States is very unusual. Space-related
firms tend to be either large, risk
averse corporations working on gov
ernment contract, or small start-up
firms, full of ideas but working hard
to raise capital and stay alive.
Among the new breed of space
entrepreneurs is Society Expeditions,
a company that is attempting to or
ganize the first chartered passenger

flight into space. Liftoff for the first
crew of space tourists is set for Oct.
12, 1992, in celebration of the 500 th
anniversary of Columbus' arrival in
the New World. According to Doris
Hanson, associate director of the
Stanford Alumni Association's
Travel/Study Program, the first group
departure of the spacecraft has
already been reserved for Stanford
alumni willing to shell out the
$50,000 round-trip fare.
The Space Enterprise Club is cur
rently attempting to put together a
space manufacturing workshop for
the April 19 manufacturing confer
ence being organized by the GSB's
Manufacturing Club.
