# Reviews of phones mixed

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The new Stanford phone system, which became fully
operational this week, has drawn criticism from faculty
and staff here who cite inefficiency and complexity as its
chief shortcomings.
"From the user point of view, it's much less efficient
than the old system," said Norm Robinson, associate dean
of Student Affairs. "The frustration has been high, and I
don't think it's because people don't realize the capabili
ties of the new phones."
Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the president, said "it's too
early to make sweeping statements, but with that caveat,
the phones have not been efficient." But he added, "My
guess is that a lot of the kinks will be worked out."
Critics say they have had difficulty placing calls, putting
callers on hold, and transferring calls within an office.
Hamrdla said he has been disconnected several times in
the midst of phone conversations.
In addition, critics say the new system is more difficult
to use because the "switchboard" director in an office
cannot determine who in the office is on the phone. The
old phones had lights that indicated which lines were in
use.
But critics acknowledge several benefits of the new sys
tem. The phones now allow for quicker, more efficient
direct dialing, they say. Elizabeth Rafferty, undergraduate
assistant in the Political Science Department, noted that
she can transfer calls directly in the new system rather

than having to wait for an operator.
Donald Carlson, director of University relations in the
Office of Public Affairs, said the new phones are working
well in his office. "People are catching on to them pretty
fast," he said. "There certainly are problems.. . . The ini
tial charge-up time for the phones may be more difficult
to handle, but in a matter of weeks they'll be far superior"
to the old system.
Michael Roberts, deputy director of Information Tech
nology Services and director of the Communications Sys
tem Project, said the installation of the new phones has
caused a few problems, but he added, "We're in good
shape."
The new phones work more rapidly and more effi
ciently than the old system, Roberts said. "Ninety-five
percent of the people are comfortable with the system."
In the new system, Roberts said, there is no "blocking"
of calls â€” the failure of calls to go through when a number
is dialed. Blocking plagued the previous University phone
system. Roberts said also that the new system offers a
simplified dialing plan for both campus and long-distance
calls.
He said he does not think the new phone system is too
complex to understand, noting, "You just have to pick up
the manual."
Roberts noted, though, that some of the telephones
have malfunctioned and that there are currently several
hundred outstanding work orders for campus phones.
"We've promised to spend spring quarter working on
this," he said.
