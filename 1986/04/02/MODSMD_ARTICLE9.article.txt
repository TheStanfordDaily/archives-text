# Drug eases suffering in AIDS patients
## 
### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
A common viral infection that often becomes fa
tal for patients with immune deficiencies — includ
ing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
— can be temporarily controlled in certain patients
with an experimental drug, according to a study
published in the March 27 issue of The New Eng
land Journal of Medicine.
The drug, known as DHPG, was able to improve
the conditions of 17 of 22 patients with underlying
immune deficiencies who had contracted
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
"This is certainly not a cure for AIDS and not
even a cure for CMV, but it is a foot in the door in a
situation where we really had no effective treat
ment approach before," Dr. Thomas Merigan, Be
cker professor of medicine at Stanford University
School of Medicine and chairman of the col
laborative study group, told the University News
Service.
Despite the initial improvement of the patients in
the experiment, however, most had a relapse of the
viral disease, and a majority of the patients died
within 10 months after completing the 14-day
treatment period.
"This study gives hope that a drug can be used to

intervene in CMV infection," Merigan said, "but it
has to be judged as only the beginning of this drug's
study. We've got to improve on its action."
Merigan's colleagues included Dr. Stuart Koretz
of Syntex Research in Palo Alto, who was study
director, Drs. William Buhles, Austin Brewin and
Robert Roe, also of Syntex; Drs. Jack Bissett and
Mark Eisenberg from Stanford, and researchers
from 15 other medical institutions in this country
and abroad.
Syntex Research supplied a grant for the re
search on DHPG, whose chemical name is 9-(1,3-
Dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine.
Though it normally causes an infection so mild
that it goes unnoticed, CMV is an extremely com
mon virus, with symptoms similar to
mononucleosis, Koretz explained. "Half of all nor
mal, healthy people have it at sometime in their
lives," he said.
Only in people whose immune systems are weak
or not working properly can CMV become a
serious and fatal disease, Koretz added. Those at
highest risk of a serious infection include organ
transplant patients who are on immunosuppressive
drugs, some patients with cancers involving cells of
the immune system and AIDS patients, he said.
In the study, 26 extremely ill patients thought to
be dying from CMV infection were given DHPG

on a "compassionate use" basis. "This is a way of
making an experimental drug available, on a
patient-by-patient basis, because the circumstances
are so compelling that there is no other therapy and
the drug could be life-saving," Merigan explained.
The drug has not yet been generally approved for
use by the Food and Drug Administration.
Twenty-two of the patients had AIDS, two had
received bone marrow transplants, one had a con
genital immunodeficiency disease and one was re
ceiving immunosuppressive drugs. Although all
were thought to have CMV infection when they
were given the drug, the researchers subsequently
determined that four of the patients probably did
not have the virus.
Among the remaining 22, 17 patients showed
some clinical improvement when given the drug
and five patients died before completion of the
treatment.
Koretz said none of the deaths was a result of
DHPG, but he added that the death of an addi
tional patient treated in research following the
original 26 could have been due to a decrease in
white blood cells, the most serious of the drugs po
tential side effects. Other side effects include
nausea, headaches, muscle pains, hallucinations
and fluid accumulation.
