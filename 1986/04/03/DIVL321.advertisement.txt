It took millions of years
to put a fish where
it's never been before.
A simple fish can be a rarity or even a nonexistent food source for many people in the
world.
Today, Peace Corps volunteers with biology degrees and fishery experience are
being trained to successfully raise freshwater fish in areas of the world where there
have never been fish before. And for the first time, people undernourished from a
diet of starches have an adequate source of protein.
It's only one of many Peace Corps projects where volunteers are sharing their
skills with others to make life better. A unique opportunity to discover the world,
and broaden your own capabilities with some real experience. At a professional
level.
If you have a biology degree or experience in any field that can suit a Peace
Corps project, call Peace Corps, toll-free, 80G-424-8580. And put your experience to
work where it can do a world of good.
U.S. Peace Corps.
The toughest job you'll ever love.
