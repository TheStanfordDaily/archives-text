Oh in be young. Bui in I his case, not too young, because you must be 18 or older to play. Also, our tickets
maybe free, but they're not for sale, as we're not an authorized Lottery retailer. And when you win, you

offer is not available on take-out orders or banquets. It's also not valid with any other offer.
