# Judge denied, racism charged
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
In a move that has sparked charges of rac
ism, black judge La Doris Cordell has been
removed from hearing the case of Stanford
protesters arrested last October in Old Un
ion for anti-apartheid sit-ins.
Cordell, a Santa Clara County M' ipal
Court Judge, was prevented from \, esi< ing
over the trial, now scheduled to begin April
14, by a peremptory challenge filed last
Friday by the District Attorney's Office.
The challenge is seen by defense attorneys
as a racist move. "The prosecution chal
lenged Judge Cordell because of her race
and sensitivity to the issue," said County
Public Defender Aram James, who
represents seven of the 23 protesters who
will stand trial.
John Starbuck, another defense attorney
who is also a Ph.D. student in Stanford's
School of Education, said the District Attor
ney's Office "bumped Cordell because she is
black and she would hone in to the jury the
differences between our system and apart
heid."
According to section 170.6 of the Califor
nia Code of Civil Procedure, each party in a
court action has the right to challenge the

judge assigned to the case. No reason need
be disclosed for the challenge, which auto
matically removes the judge from presiding
over the matter.
In an article in yesterday's Times Tribune,
Deputy District Attorney Peter Waite was
quoted as saying that Cordell "is prejudiced
against the party or the interest of the party
so that declarant cannot or believes that he
cannot have a fair and impartial trial or
hearing before such judge.''
Waite told the Tribune that Cordell "does
have a lot of ties to Stanford and we think it
better that the judge be unconnected to
Stanford."
"We have never challenged Judge Cordell
before, and I don't anticipate we would
challenge her again. We would be willing to
take her in any other case," Waite said.
Cordell graduated from Stanford Law
School in 1974 and was assistant dean of
student affairs at the Law School for four
years until she was appointed to the bench in
1982 by former California Gov. Jerry
Brown. Last week she was the recipient of a
1985 Woman of the Year achievement
award in politics and government from the
League of Friends, the county Commission
on the Status of Women and the San Jose
Mercury News.

Cordell's Stanford connections are not a
good reason for the prosecution to remove
her from the hearing, Starbuck said.
"Stanford University is pursuing the case,"
he said, arguing that Cordell's ties to Stan
ford as an administrator would most likely
act in the prosecution's favor.
According to James. Cordell has never
been challenged before. "Everyone respects
her highly as a fair judge," James said, add
ing that the challenge "raises a strong
suspicion of racial overtones."
The trial involves charges of trespass, un
lawful assembly and refusal to disperse fol
lowing anti-apartheid demonstrations at
Stanford last Oct. 11, 14. and 16.
Forty-eight protesters were arrested
during the demonstrations for refusing to
leave Old Union when the building closed in
protest of the racist apartheid policy in
South Africa and the University's refusal to
divest of investments in companies that do
business in that country.
Among the 23 protesters are Statistics
Prof. Charles Stein and 22 students. Those
who were arrested but will not stand trial on
April 1 4 have either decided not to join the
mass trial or have entered pleas of guilty or


Senior Robby Perkins, one of the anti-apartheid demonstra
tors who will go on trial April 14, persuades Jim Costain and
Antoinette Carter to buy a T-shirt in support of the

Mike Topolovac/Daily
protesters' legal defense fund. Perkins was one of 48 demon
strators arrested in three October incidents. Statistics Prof.
Charles Stein will join 22 students in court.
