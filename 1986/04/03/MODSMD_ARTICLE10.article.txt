## Total divestment is the best policy 
### 
Bishop Desmond Tutu, in his January speech at
Stanford, called on us to make a moral decision re
garding South Africa. He told us that there is no
middle ground: we are either with apartheid or
against it. Apartheid is immoral, he said, and the
appropriate action is unmistakeable — we should
withdraw our investments and cut any ties which
support the apartheid government. This will hasten

WILLIAM MASTERS

the transition to democratic rule. The alternatives,
he told us, will only serve to prolong an already
bloody conflict.
The moral logic is clear. So, for that matter, are
the political and economic means by which divest
ment would bring change. Fourteen American uni
versities have followed this logic into policies of
total divestment. Thirty-three others have made
partial divestments. Eleven states and 36 cities
have passed various sorts of divestment legislation.
These measures, along with the many other forms
of action against apartheid, have brought unprece
dented external pressure on the Pretoria regime.
This pressure has not yet sufficed to bring down
apartheid, but it has made its weaknesses apparent,
and has undeniably hastened the day of change.
Stanford has not been a part of this movement. It
has never divested, not even of a single share. Yet
surely President Kennedy and our Board of Trus
tees understand the issue. They know what is at
stake for the majority of South Africans. Why do
they try to avoid the decisive action called for by
Bishop Tutu and other independent anti-apartheid
leaders?

This question was answered quite directly by
William Massy, University Vice-President for Busi
ness and Finance, in a memo entitled "On Total
Divestment." In the memo, he explained that the
consequences of divestment on financial returns to
the University endowment were uncertain but not
ultimately decisive. "There are additional consider
ations," he wrote, "related to fund-raising . . .
(that) may well be of greater consequence. . . . The
financial consequences of a substantial loss of
donor goodwill would be substantial. . .."
Like other private universities, Stanford has al
ways been dependent on private contributions.
Keeping the good will of donors is a natural priority
for the University administration. Today, private

gifts make up over 20 percent ot our income, twice
the amount received from government grants. And.
because divestment has been so very unpopular
among our major donors, it is assumed that di
vestment would cause a massive loss of donor good
will and generosity.
But this isn't necessarily so. True, a policy of
selective divestment (such as that we have so far
been half-heartedly pursuing) makes judgments
about individual firms, and is unpleasant for all
concerned. But a policy of total divestment is not
necessarily so divisive. Total divestment does not
judge individual firms, except insofar as they may
invest in South Africa. That is precisely the point.

Total divestment is an action against apartheid itself\
not against the behavior of specific firms or against
the business community.
Total divestment would require a minimum of
meddling in the affairs of business. It also offers a
much clearer criterion for action than our current
policy, and would have clearer moral and politcal
effects. It says that no matter how well-intentioned
a business may be. working in South Africa without
helping the government is impossible. This puts the
blame for apartheid squarely on the government's
shoulders, where it belongs.
No one denies the valuable contributions of
some American companies in helping some South
African blacks, through scholarships and other pro
grams. But those actions do not address apartheid
and they were never meant to. Total divestment is
necessary to move beyond these small personalized
efforts, to make a larger statement about apartheid
itself. This is what Bishop Tutu, along with count
less others, is asking for. And surely, it is not too
much to ask our many corporate and private
donors to see this as a good thing.
A university should not behave as a private com
pany. Universities should be special places of moral
and intellectual leadership. We may justly pride
ourselves on the new Center for Integrated Sys
tems. and the many other achievements of our
partnership with corporate donors. But surely we
also pride ourselves on our moral and intellectual
independence. That independence has been crucial
to our University's excellence in the long run —
and excellence, in all spheres, is what this Univer
sity is all about.

gifts make up over 20 percent ot our income, twice

because divestment has been so very unpopular
among our major donors, it is assumed that di
vestment would cause a massive loss of donor good
will and generosity.
But this isn't necessarily so. True, a policy of
selective divestment (such as that we have so far
been half-heartedly pursuing) makes judgments
about individual firms, and is unpleasant for all
concerned. But a policy of total divestment is not
necessarily so divisive. Total divestment does not
judge individual firms, except insofar as they may
invest in South Africa. That is precisely the point.

Total divestment is an action against apartheid itself\
not against the behavior of specific firms or against
the business community.
Total divestment would require a minimum of
meddling in the affairs of business. It also offers a
much clearer criterion for action than our current
policy, and would have clearer moral and politcal
effects. It says that no matter how well-intentioned
a business may be. working in South Africa without
helping the government is impossible. This puts the
blame for apartheid squarely on the government's
shoulders, where it belongs.
No one denies the valuable contributions of
some American companies in helping some South
African blacks, through scholarships and other pro
grams. But those actions do not address apartheid
and they were never meant to. Total divestment is
necessary to move beyond these small personalized
efforts, to make a larger statement about apartheid
itself. This is what Bishop Tutu, along with count
less others, is asking for. And surely, it is not too
much to ask our many corporate and private
donors to see this as a good thing.
A university should not behave as a private com
pany. Universities should be special places of moral
and intellectual leadership. We may justly pride
ourselves on the new Center for Integrated Sys
tems. and the many other achievements of our
partnership with corporate donors. But surely we
also pride ourselves on our moral and intellectual
independence. That independence has been crucial
to our University's excellence in the long run —
and excellence, in all spheres, is what this Univer
sity is all about.
