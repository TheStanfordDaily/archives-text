# Reagan, windmills and SDI
## 
### 
Several weeks ago novelist Carlos Fuentes published a
piece in The New York Times Book Review about a
translation of " Don Quixote" soon to be brought out by
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Fuentes wrote the introduction
for the new release (actually a re-issue of a 1755 edition
by Tobias Smollett), and he explains in his prefatory
remarks why the Cervantes' classic has always been an im-

portant book for him. He describes his days as a young
student in Latin American, and remembers a particularly
persistent question of his teachers: what date or event
marked the boundary between the Middle Ages and the
modern world? Was it the fall of Constantinople in 1453?
Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492? The
publication of Copernicus' "Revolutions of the Spheres"
in 1543? Fuentes says that he found the answer to this
puzzling question in "Don Quixote" — that the modern
era was ushered in when the Spanish country gentleman
left his village in 1605 to ride off into the adventure of life
and discovered that the world of experience was not
identical to the world of the books he had read. "Many
things are changing in the world," Fuentes writes, "many
things are surviving. " Don Quixote" tells us just this: that
is why he is so modern but also so ancient, so eternal."
Fuentes recalls a teaching of Vico's — the past is pres
ent in each of us because we have collectively inherited
the civilization we ourselves created — which seems to
suggest that all great art, though colored by distinct no
tions of time and place, pierces through what is forever
true in man's condition. If the modern world is character
ized by a novelty of experience, by a dilemma of being on
a road on which everything is ephemeral and nothing
seems familiar, it also drags with it the old verities of
human nature — its strengths and inconsistencies.
The figure of Don Quixote is an important one today.
For in our world, sifting throught the past to find a
relevance that will bring the present into focus is as diffi
cult a task as ever. As a frame of reference, Quixote is sig
nificant because he shows us the tension that exists in
anyone who has one foot anchored in the past and another
sprinting ahead, almost blindly, to an unknown future.
President Reagan, an old-line conservative with some
brash new ideas about national security, has put himself
right into the pages of Cervantes, for, like Don Quixote,
his Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) is part of two
epochs: the old world which judged anything bigger as
better, and the new world which translates all of this into
atomic vocabularies.
Nations have forever been confronted with the chal
lenge of preservation; this responsibility is certainly noth
ing new to government. History has indicated that regard

less of the sophistication of a defense network, it will
eventually topple. And in the modern age, with the ul
timate destructive capabilities of its weapons, the stakes
have become more immediate. President Reagan seems
blinded by the ancient promise of invincibility, of "final
solution," which our mutable world has continually
resisted. The real danger is that the military systems in
volved are more pernicious than ever to human life. The
very fact that most leading scientists and researchers af
firm that the necessary technologies for SDI are out of the
reach of today's laboratories raises again the old struggle
of Don Quixote — distinguishing what is real from what is
illusion — and conjures up in the mind's eye the startled
and horrified look of a matador when the bull doesn't fall
for the old magic. And although the picture of an aging
president envisioning an imaginary peace shield stretched
across his lands seems vaguely reminiscent of an aging
knight chasing windmills, the crucial difference is that the
knight rode away from his defeat, silhouetted against the
horizon, while after a breakdown of the SDI network
there is a risk that no one would ride away, and nothing
would stand to break the line where land meets sky.
Homer tried to coach us about the fallacy of military
might. In the "Iliad," he tells us that the giant wall and
moat complex built by the Greeks to protect their boats
was overrun by the Trojans. And although the poem con-

Reagan seems blinded by ;
the ancient promise of in
vincibility, of the "final so
lution" which our mutable
world has continually
resisted.

eludes before the war is over, most of us know that the
only thing needed to bring down the walls of the great city
of Troy was a little cunning. What I respect in Homer —
and what I think makes the "Iliad" a great epic narrative
— is the simple fact that he did not try to solve the human
dilemma. He did not pretend to have the lasting answers.
This does not mean, however, that he is a poet of despair.
He projects a powerful hope than man will restore his
world to balance, without expressing a naivete that he will
forever cleanse himself of the aggressiveness and hostility
which leads him to war. Most of all, Homer had the sense
to see that the true field of action was the human heart in
conflict with itself. What Reagan proposes to do by taking
the battle into space is removing this conflict from where
it belongs.

ized by a novelty of experience, by a dilemma of being on

The figure of Don Quixote is an important one today.
For in our world, sifting throught the past to find a
relevance that will bring the present into focus is as diffi

anyone who has one foot anchored in the past and another

President Reagan, an old-line conservative with some
brash new ideas about national security, has put himself
right into the pages of Cervantes, for, like Don Quixote,
his Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) is part of two
epochs: the old world which judged anything bigger as
better, and the new world which translates all of this into
atomic vocabularies.
Nations have forever been confronted with the chal
lenge of preservation; this responsibility is certainly noth
ing new to government. History has indicated that regard

less of the sophistication of a defense network, it will
eventually topple. And in the modern age, with the ul
timate destructive capabilities of its weapons, the stakes
have become more immediate. President Reagan seems
blinded by the ancient promise of invincibility, of "final
solution," which our mutable world has continually
resisted. The real danger is that the military systems in
volved are more pernicious than ever to human life. The
very fact that most leading scientists and researchers af
firm that the necessary technologies for SDI are out of the
reach of today's laboratories raises again the old struggle
of Don Quixote — distinguishing what is real from what is
illusion — and conjures up in the mind's eye the startled
and horrified look of a matador when the bull doesn't fall
for the old magic. And although the picture of an aging
president envisioning an imaginary peace shield stretched
across his lands seems vaguely reminiscent of an aging
knight chasing windmills, the crucial difference is that the
knight rode away from his defeat, silhouetted against the
horizon, while after a breakdown of the SDI network
there is a risk that no one would ride away, and nothing
would stand to break the line where land meets sky.

and what I think makes the "Iliad" a great epic narrative
— is the simple fact that he did not try to solve the human
dilemma. He did not pretend to have the lasting answers.

He projects a powerful hope than man will restore his
world to balance, without expressing a naivete that he will

conflict with itself. What Reagan proposes to do by taking
the battle into space is removing this conflict from where
it belongs.

Several weeks ago novelist Carlos Fuentes published a
piece in The New York Times Book Review about a
translation of " Don Quixote" soon to be brought out by
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Fuentes wrote the introduction
for the new release (actually a re-issue of a 1755 edition
by Tobias Smollett), and he explains in his prefatory
remarks why the Cervantes' classic has always been an im-

portant book for him. He describes his days as a young
student in Latin American, and remembers a particularly
persistent question of his teachers: what date or event
marked the boundary between the Middle Ages and the
modern world? Was it the fall of Constantinople in 1453?
Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492? The
publication of Copernicus' "Revolutions of the Spheres"
in 1543? Fuentes says that he found the answer to this
puzzling question in "Don Quixote" — that the modern
era was ushered in when the Spanish country gentleman
left his village in 1605 to ride off into the adventure of life
and discovered that the world of experience was not
identical to the world of the books he had read. "Many
things are changing in the world," Fuentes writes, "many
things are surviving. " Don Quixote" tells us just this: that
is why he is so modern but also so ancient, so eternal."
Fuentes recalls a teaching of Vico's — the past is pres
ent in each of us because we have collectively inherited
the civilization we ourselves created — which seems to
suggest that all great art, though colored by distinct no
tions of time and place, pierces through what is forever
true in man's condition. If the modern world is character
ized by a novelty of experience, by a dilemma of being on
a road on which everything is ephemeral and nothing
seems familiar, it also drags with it the old verities of
human nature — its strengths and inconsistencies.
