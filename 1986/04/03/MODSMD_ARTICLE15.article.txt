## CAMPUS COMPENDIUM 
### 
Ah, Spring
While the Cardinal was away, the Bears did
play, but not to the Berkeley administration's
liking.
Seems as if the once-prestigious Berkeley
secret society known as Skull and Keys was a
bit overzealous in its initiation procedures last
month. The initiates were "allegedly exhorted
to vomit on each other," according to the
Daily Californian.
(Take note, Pi Phis, it's rush time again.)
The ceremonial purge was to have taken
place at the "Tomb" — a squat concrete club
house. Rather repulsed neighbors who wit
nessed the alleged activities described the
messy incident as follows:
"Some members in white caps stood
around the tuxedo-clad initiates as they exited
the tomb, tossed them cans of beer and yelled
'Drink, drink, drink.' As the intiates drank
the beer, other members on the roof poured a
mixture of food, garbage, mud and red paint
on top of them.
"Then, while members shouted Throw up
in his ear,' the initiates, standing in a line,
vomited on the man next to them. .. . The in

itiates were also told to urinate on each
other."
In the society's defense I introduce you to
"Uncle" Tom Kuglen, president of Skull and
Keys. Kuglen contends that the neighbors
who complained have a "very biased opinion
about us" and exaggerated the incident. He
did acknowledge, however, that there was "a
lot of alcohol" at the initiation.
Apparently, the traditional initiation proce
dure is for the initiates to stand in a line and
one by one "come forward and tell a joke, do
a skit" and be introduced to the other in
itiates, according to Skull and Keys Alumni
Chair Lindsay Gordon. In response to the
various alleged activities of the initiates, Gor
don replied, "I don't believe that's part of the
tradition."
But let me leave you with this direct and in
sightful comment by Skull and Keys member
Roy Erickson: "I'd be goddamned if I would
ever let someone urinate on me."
Who's zooming who?
Those wonderful wacky Yalies are at it
again. Last month, two Yale juniors took part
in the "weirdest mock wedding that has gone

on yet," according to the junior male who
played the part of the bride, Aimee Zing.
(No, this is not about Jennifer Beals' recent
marriage to some two-week lover of hers.)
"Her" nuptials with female junior Julian
Ardis Grace 111 — the groom — took place in
conjunction with a $3 cover charge to benefit
the 1986 Gay-Lesbian Awareness Days
(GLAD) Arts Festival.
"My parents wanted I should get married,
and Julian asked me to marry him," Zing told
the Yale Daily News. "So I said, hey,
whatever, why not?
"It's like 14,000 steps above anything I've
seen done before," "she" continued. "It's not
the transsexual. It's not the transvestite
crowd. I mean, I don't believe in drag. There's
no such thing. I mean, gender is up (in one's
head). That's what I found."
"It'll be brief, elegant and formal," Grace
("he") said of the ceremony. "Then we hope
to have a good time with the party. I'm not
sure I would call it traditional, but I would
certainly call it recognizable."
Students of many races played the parts of
the parents, bridesmaids and, of course, the
presiding cleric.

"Hopefully, there will be dry ice effects,"
Zing continued. "You know, wedding a la
1986 video. And the dance is going to be
thrilling. I mean, I want a party more than
anything, and this is the perfect theme. I
mean, I'm getting married, so let's do some
thing."
Wonder if Imelda and Ferdinand sponsored
this.
C'mon $5000!
Man, those Bears get everything.
There we sit, afternoon after afternoon,
watching game show after game show in front
of the Lambda Nu tube. And now we finally
have the opportunity to display our trivia tal
ents to the world and they go and pick
Berkeley, of all universities, to join Princeton,
the University of Hawaii, Georgia Tech and
New York University in the special "College
Week" shows of "Wheel of Fortune" to be
aired in May.
Harv Selsby, contestant coordinator for
"Wheel of Fortune," will choose 12 students
from each school to appear on the program.
Four students from each university will entice
us and delight us with their charm and wisdom

during "College Week." The rest will appear,
at their convenience, over the rest of the year.
Let' s hope the Berkeley students can
refrain from vomiting on Vanna White.
Going to a Go-Go
And on a final note: Looking for a part
time or summer job but just haven't had any
luck? Talk to Harvard junior Susan Kelly,
who every Saturday night dons a bright red
wig, a tight sequined bodice and displays her
bodily talents as she "erotically gyrates be
hind glass bars.'' She is the flashdance
woman.
This native of Chattanooga, Tenn., makes
$40 a night.
Why?
"I came to Harvard because 1 wanted to get
out of the South, because I had this romantic
vision of interesting people doing interesting
things alUhe time."
And what do Mom and Pop think of their
little show girl?
"(Mom) thinks the go-go dancing is
adorable."
