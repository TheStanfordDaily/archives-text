Theatre (1600 Holloway). 469-2467.
The Curran Theatre: Presents
"Legends!," a production starring
Mary Martin and Carol Channing.
Opens April 25. Confidentially, the
press release calls this a "wickedly
funny feud," but the Los Angeles
Times thought it was really just a
smarmy piece of kitsch. But don't let
me influence you. Go ahead — call
673-4400 for tickets. Maybe they
know where the theater is, too; the
press release was remarkably useless
in that regard.
