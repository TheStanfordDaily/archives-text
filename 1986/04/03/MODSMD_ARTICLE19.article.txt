# A.C.T. conjures Christ's magic without meaning
## Mediocre season continues as acting company misses spiritual purpose of 'Passion Cycle' 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
"The Passion Cycle," a collection of parable
plays about the life of Jesus Christ, opened at
A.C.T. last week just in time for Easter. The show
marks both a conservative and experimental pro
duction for the company. It is obviously a calcu
lated attempt to attract patrons with a Christian
drama during the Easter season, but it is also a risk
because it is an obscure medieval play.
"Mystery plays," collections of medieval mini
plays about the events of Christ's life, are virtually
unknown outside academic circles. Those few who
do know them regard them as didactic pieces highly
effective in their time, but dull and unplayable in
the "modern" age.
Britain's National Theatre disproved this theory
last year, however, with its sell-out production of
the York Mystery plays. Apparently the modern
world wants to believe in Christianity just as much
as the medieval one. It's just a matter of being in
spired both on stage and off. Like any drama aimed
at spiritual inspiration, a medieval mystery play is a
terribly difficult thing to present effectively, and
the A.C.T. production is no more than adequate.
I should qualify my remarks before continuing. I
am no expert on what a mystery play should look
like, but I have been bombarded by stories from
friends who saw the magical production in Britain.

Secondly, I have recently seen a few too many
shows which start with a cast entrance through the
audience followed by onstage actors dropping char
acter to simply observe the play along with the au
dience.
This occurs in the A.C.T. show, and if it sounds
new and interesting to you, great. Unfortunately,
after the company's third time around with this
device this year, I kept wanting it to be more than a
fun gimmick or a pseudo-Brechtian ploy. So maybe
my expectations about being "inspired" were too
high and my receptiveness to "unconventional"
staging was too low.
In any case, A.C.T. presents the life of Jesus
Christ from baptism to crucifixion without inter
mission. It is only a 90-minute show, but it is a slow
evening nonetheless. There are surprises, like a
Lazarus that breakdances after resurrection, but
these are few and far between.
Director Bill Ball has incorporated into his
staging many elegant tableaux echoing great Re
naissance paintings, but these alone cannot carry
the show. The same can be said of the plank and
post set which suggests, as my friend pointed out,
both a ship and a courtroom (wonderful metaphors
for Christ's teachings).
Scot Bishop, as with earlier shows this season,
has been miscast in the central role of Jesus, even
though this is his strongest performance to date.
I guess what really bothered me about the show

was the absence of inspiring awe, at least in a form
that I could attach myself to. The "magic" of the
Christian spirit meant to he captured by mystery
plays was emphasized by the "magic" of
melodramatic miracles. Certainly Christ's healing
miracles offer opportunities to inspire the audi
ence, but only if they point to his inner spirituality
and not just at themselves.
The healing of the blind man, the raising of
Lazarus, and the curing of the Roman officers ear
are miracles so familiar to the audience that to un
derplay them rather then to overplay them is the
key to their effectiveness. Heightening the miracles
with large gestures, suspenseful pauses and
screams of joy distanced me from the show, much in
the same way preachers who heal invalids on na
tional TV alienate me. Christ may have restored
sight to a blind man, but 1 only saw an overworked
magician's trick.
I was brought down a notch the other day by a
friend who said I was too intellectual a reviewer.
This is true. Like anyone who sees too many plays,
movies or television, 1 am jaded by certain things,
particularly certain "crowd-pleasing" tactics.
1 do not think many "ordinary" theatre goers at
last week's opening would disagree with me,
though, in saying that "The Passion Cycle" was a
lackluster show. For whatever reasoas, A.C.T. ac
curately presents the life of Christ with little of the
moving inspiration associated with that life.

I should qualify my remarks before continuing. I
am no expert on what a mystery play should look
like, but I have been bombarded by stories from
friends who saw the magical production in Britain.

Secondly, I have recently seen a few too many
shows which start with a cast entrance through the
audience followed by onstage actors dropping char
acter to simply observe the play along with the au
dience.
This occurs in the A.C.T. show, and if it sounds
new and interesting to you, great. Unfortunately,
after the company's third time around with this
device this year, I kept wanting it to be more than a
fun gimmick or a pseudo-Brechtian ploy. So maybe
my expectations about being "inspired" were too
high and my receptiveness to "unconventional"
staging was too low.
In any case, A.C.T. presents the life of Jesus
Christ from baptism to crucifixion without inter
mission. It is only a 90-minute show, but it is a slow
evening nonetheless. There are surprises, like a
Lazarus that breakdances after resurrection, but
these are few and far between.
Director Bill Ball has incorporated into his
staging many elegant tableaux echoing great Re
naissance paintings, but these alone cannot carry
the show. The same can be said of the plank and
post set which suggests, as my friend pointed out,
both a ship and a courtroom (wonderful metaphors
for Christ's teachings).
Scot Bishop, as with earlier shows this season,
has been miscast in the central role of Jesus, even
though this is his strongest performance to date.
I guess what really bothered me about the show

was the absence of inspiring awe, at least in a form
that I could attach myself to. The "magic" of the
Christian spirit meant to he captured by mystery
plays was emphasized by the "magic" of
melodramatic miracles. Certainly Christ's healing
miracles offer opportunities to inspire the audi
ence, but only if they point to his inner spirituality
and not just at themselves.
The healing of the blind man, the raising of
Lazarus, and the curing of the Roman officers ear
are miracles so familiar to the audience that to un
derplay them rather then to overplay them is the
key to their effectiveness. Heightening the miracles
with large gestures, suspenseful pauses and
screams of joy distanced me from the show, much in
the same way preachers who heal invalids on na
tional TV alienate me. Christ may have restored
sight to a blind man, but 1 only saw an overworked
magician's trick.
I was brought down a notch the other day by a
friend who said I was too intellectual a reviewer.
This is true. Like anyone who sees too many plays,
movies or television, 1 am jaded by certain things,
particularly certain "crowd-pleasing" tactics.
1 do not think many "ordinary" theatre goers at
last week's opening would disagree with me,
though, in saying that "The Passion Cycle" was a
lackluster show. For whatever reasoas, A.C.T. ac
curately presents the life of Christ with little of the
moving inspiration associated with that life.

(Jill Fine) and James (Denis Jones) stand beneath the dying messiah in
the American Conservatory Theatre's production of "The Passion
Cycle," which will run through April 19 at the Geary theatre in San
Francisco.
