# Fac Senate to vote on GPA standard
## 'Average' student track proposed 
### KRISTEN BROWN Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will vote today on a pro
posal that would force all departments to pro
vide at least one academic track in which
"average" students can graduate.
Currently, some departments require stu
dents to maintain high grade-point averages in
certain tracks. The proposal, from the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US), would
require all departments to offer at least one
track in which students can earn a degree with
only a 'C average or better.
"We are proposing that departments and pro
grams, if they do set performance requirements
at higher than a 2.0 level (on a 4.0 scale), in or
der to graduate from some tracks in the depart
ment, that they may not set their requirements
higher than a 2.0 level in at least one track,"
said Classics Prof. Marsh McCall, the commit
tee chairman.
The proposal also says that "the requirements
of the special-performance tracks must have
sufficient overlap with the standard track to
permit graduation in the major by students
unable to meet the expectations of special per
formance."
"For example, a specialized debate track in
an imagined Speech Department may require
B's or better in six of 12 courses taken for the
B.S. in Speech (Debate). However, the student
whose performance in the same 12 courses falls
short of this higher standard, while satisfying
the 2.0 eradennint requirement must still be

allowed to graduate with a B.S. in Speech,"
McCall explained.
McCall said that C-US "originally decided to
do the exact opposite" of what the proposal
now sets out to do.
According to McCall, the committe had ini
tially discussed proposing a University-wide
performance minimum in the major for gradua
tion (e.g., a 2.0 average in courses taken to ful
fill major requirements.)
"In the meantime," said McCall, "we came
across certain cases where departments were re
quiring performance at close to a ' B' level in or
der to graduate from the department."
"The committee quickly and unanimously
agreed that such a performance requirement
was too strict, and potentially denied average
students who were interested in a particular de
partment (from) having a degree from that de
partment," McCall said. "We thought that if a
student was able to perform at a 'C level, that
that student should be able to get a degree in
that department."
The committee recommended no change in
current entrance requirements for students
choosing an academic major. While a depart
ment may set course prerequisites for
prospective majors, it may not require more
than the simple completion of the course.
" A student may be required to take a calculus
course as a prerequisite before being admitted
to a major, for example, but he may not be re
quired to earn better than a minimal pass, a
' D'," McCall said.
