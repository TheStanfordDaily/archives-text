## Louis, Besosa lead Stanford to NCAAs 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
This weekend the second-ranked
Stanford men's gymnastics team will
have a chance to capture its first-ever
national championship.
But to team stars and national team
members Randy Besosa and Jon
Louis, the Lincoln, Neb., meet is just
one important upcoming event in
their blossoming careers as interna
tional competitors.
"A meet is a meet. A fluke can put
you out of it. I never set my heart on
anything," said Besosa, a junior from
Mission Viejo who is currently tied
with Louis as the 13th-ranked gym
nast in the nation. "We'll put on a
good show — that's what gymnastics
is all about."
Louis, a senior from New Orleans,
was also cautious about Stanford's
chances in this weekend's meet,
which will take place at the Univer
sity of Nebraska tomorrow and Satur
day. "We have a very good chance of
making the top three. If we do that,
we'll be excited. But it will require a
bit of luck" to overcome rivals
UCLA, Nebraska and Arizona State,
he said.
But to more optimistic observers,
such as Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada, the two have not only the
ability to lead Stanford to a national
championship but the talent to com
pete internationally and possibly
qualify for the 1988 Olympics.
"Some gymnasts are trying to
maintain the same level, but Jon and
Randy are still improving," Hamada
said, adding that he is "very optimis
tic about those guys' chances of
making the Olympics in '88."
Louis' 9.9 score on the floor exer
cise and Besosa's 9.9 on the horizon
tal bar are the top scores in those
events nationally this year. The two
also led Stanford to this season's top
team score of 283.65.
Confessing that he "still needs
more experience" to be a top con
tender for the Olympic games, Louis
said, "I've only competed interna
tionally two or three times. Now I
want to get my routines good enough
for international competition and
next year to improve to the point of
winning overseas."
Louis, the Stanford team captain,
said it is "hard to tell" about his
chances of making the Olympic team
"because of the new people coming
up" who may be tough competitors in

the qualifying meet, still two years
off.
"At the end of 1987, if I really feel
I can make the team, I'll go for it all
the way," Louis said. "But I don't
think it takes a 24-hour-a-day com
mitment. I have other ambitions." A
communications major, one of Louis'
ambitions is in feature film produc
tion.
Besosa evaluated his shot at the
Olympics in terms of numbers. "I
have this year and next year to move
up in the rankings. This year if I come
in 10th (in the national champion
ships) and next year eighth, then I'll
go (to the Olympics). I could have a
bad meet one day and not be able to
go," he said.

To qualify for the Olympics, a gym
nast must finish in the top eight in the
Olympic qualifying meet, Besosa ex
plained.
In the meantime, he and Louis will
concentrate on the end of this season
and upcoming international competi
tion.
Last weekend, Stanford finished a
disappointing second in the Pacific 10
Conference championship meet when
team members faltered in the final
event and lost a slight lead to UCLA.
Stanford had been ranked first going
into the meet.
According to Hamada, however,
the team had a "strong week" of
training during spring break and "got

the physical level way up high.
Preparations went pretty well, and
hopefully we can see the results from
our good training," he said.
The Pac-10 loss "really didn't mat
ter," Besosa said. "We didn't want to
peak at the Pac-lOs. 1 had a hard
meet. 1 wasn't quick. I just made
everything— I didn't make it well."
Louis, who was the meet's all
around champion called the result
"sweet and sour," saying, "It wasn't
too surprising, but in my mind we're
better than UCLA. We lost by such a
small margin because we didn't take
the last event seriously." Stanford
lost 282.85-281.85.
"We definitely have the capacity to

win (the NCAA meet)," Besosa said.
"Basically, you want to have every
one hit. Then you worry about the
outcome.
"It's nice that we're in this position.
1 don't get psyched up until the day of
(the competition). You have just got
to try to do what you know you can
do," he said. "We've been consistent
all year, but it's so close it could come
down to one break."
In individual competition, the
leading gymnasts are so close that
"there are six or eight guys who, if
everyone hit, could tie for first — it
comes down "to so little. All you can"
do is go out and put on a good show
and know that you did your best,"
Besosa said.

In Hamada's opinion, the team
would not be in contention for the na
tional championship if not for Louis
and Besosa.
"They're two top all-arounders,
and they're very competitive —
there's a strong rivalry between
them," Hamada said. That rivalry
pushes the two gymnasts and inspires
the whole team, he added.
Louis agreed that his rivalry with
Besosa has benefited the team. "If
one of us improves, it gives incentive
for the other to improve," he said,
adding that Hamada is "one of the
best (coaches) in the country" and
has worked well with him and Besosa.
Louis added that a strong sense of
team unity and mutual encourage
ment has also contributed to the suc
cess of this year's team. In his first
year at Stanford, when the team was
traveling, Hamada would give indi
viduals meal money and each team
member would eat by himself, Louis
said. "Now we go out as a team," he
said, citing this as an example of the
team's attitude.
The success of this year's team has
also helped Hamada satisfy two
coaching ambitions: to be at the top
of NCAA competition and "to
produce as many international Olym
pians as possible."
On April 30, Louis will travel with
a team coached by Hamada to the In
ternational Sports Fair in Tokyo,
Japan, and Besosa will compete in
Czechoslovakia in a meet beginning
May 10.
Thanks to Louis and Besosa, the
Stanford gymnastics program "is
going in the right direction," accord
ing to Hamada. Louis "has had the
biggest impact on Stanford" because
of his decision to attend Stanford four
years ago, a move that attracted other
top gymnasts like Besosa to the
school and established Stanford as a
leading gymnastics school.
Last year the team finished seventh
among 10 teams at the NCAA cham
pionships in what Besosa called "the
first year we were really good."
At the beginning of this season,
Besosa said he knew the team had the
potential to be even better. "I knew
we'd be good, but I didn't know how
good," he said. "Toward the middle
of the season, I knew we had some
thing."
"Last year, we wanted to make it
[to the NCAA meet]," Besosa said.
"This year we want to win it."

At the beginning of this season,
Besosa said he knew the team had the
potential to be even better. "I knew
we'd be good, but I didn't know how
good," he said. "Toward the middle
of the season, I knew we had some
thing."
"Last year, we wanted to make it
[to the NCAA meet]," Besosa said.
"This year we want to win it."


Junior Randy Besosa (left) and senior Jon Louis (right) have been the
keys to the Stanford gymnastics program's emergence as a national
power. After a seventh-place finish last year, the Cardinal is ranked


Sarah Rosenbaum/Daily file
second in the nation heading into this weekend's NCAA Championships
in Lincoln, Neb. Louis' 9.9 score in the floor exercise and Besosa's 9.9
on the horizontal bar are tops in these events in the nation this year.
This weekend the second-ranked
Stanford men's gymnastics team will
have a chance to capture its first-ever
national championship.
But to team stars and national team
members Randy Besosa and Jon
Louis, the Lincoln, Neb., meet is just
one important upcoming event in
their blossoming careers as interna
tional competitors.
"A meet is a meet. A fluke can put
you out of it. I never set my heart on
anything," said Besosa, a junior from
Mission Viejo who is currently tied
with Louis as the 13th-ranked gym
nast in the nation. "We'll put on a
good show — that's what gymnastics
is all about."
Louis, a senior from New Orleans,
was also cautious about Stanford's
chances in this weekend's meet,
which will take place at the Univer
sity of Nebraska tomorrow and Satur
day. "We have a very good chance of
making the top three. If we do that,
we'll be excited. But it will require a
bit of luck" to overcome rivals
UCLA, Nebraska and Arizona State,
he said.
But to more optimistic observers,
such as Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada, the two have not only the
ability to lead Stanford to a national
championship but the talent to com
pete internationally and possibly
qualify for the 1988 Olympics.
"Some gymnasts are trying to
maintain the same level, but Jon and
Randy are still improving," Hamada
said, adding that he is "very optimis
tic about those guys' chances of
making the Olympics in '88."
Louis' 9.9 score on the floor exer
cise and Besosa's 9.9 on the horizon
tal bar are the top scores in those
events nationally this year. The two
also led Stanford to this season's top
team score of 283.65.
Confessing that he "still needs
more experience" to be a top con
tender for the Olympic games, Louis
said, "I've only competed interna
tionally two or three times. Now I
want to get my routines good enough
for international competition and
next year to improve to the point of
winning overseas."
Louis, the Stanford team captain,
said it is "hard to tell" about his
chances of making the Olympic team
"because of the new people coming
up" who may be tough competitors in

the qualifying meet, still two years
off.
"At the end of 1987, if I really feel
I can make the team, I'll go for it all
the way," Louis said. "But I don't
think it takes a 24-hour-a-day com
mitment. I have other ambitions." A
communications major, one of Louis'
ambitions is in feature film produc
tion.
Besosa evaluated his shot at the
Olympics in terms of numbers. "I
have this year and next year to move
up in the rankings. This year if I come
in 10th (in the national champion
ships) and next year eighth, then I'll
go (to the Olympics). I could have a
bad meet one day and not be able to
go," he said.

To qualify for the Olympics, a gym
nast must finish in the top eight in the
Olympic qualifying meet, Besosa ex
plained.
In the meantime, he and Louis will
concentrate on the end of this season
and upcoming international competi
tion.
Last weekend, Stanford finished a
disappointing second in the Pacific 10
Conference championship meet when
team members faltered in the final
event and lost a slight lead to UCLA.
Stanford had been ranked first going
into the meet.
According to Hamada, however,
the team had a "strong week" of
training during spring break and "got

the physical level way up high.
Preparations went pretty well, and
hopefully we can see the results from
our good training," he said.
The Pac-10 loss "really didn't mat
ter," Besosa said. "We didn't want to
peak at the Pac-lOs. 1 had a hard
meet. 1 wasn't quick. I just made
everything— I didn't make it well."
Louis, who was the meet's all
around champion called the result
"sweet and sour," saying, "It wasn't
too surprising, but in my mind we're
better than UCLA. We lost by such a
small margin because we didn't take
the last event seriously." Stanford
lost 282.85-281.85.
"We definitely have the capacity to

win (the NCAA meet)," Besosa said.
"Basically, you want to have every
one hit. Then you worry about the
outcome.
"It's nice that we're in this position.
1 don't get psyched up until the day of
(the competition). You have just got
to try to do what you know you can
do," he said. "We've been consistent
all year, but it's so close it could come
down to one break."
In individual competition, the
leading gymnasts are so close that
"there are six or eight guys who, if
everyone hit, could tie for first — it
comes down "to so little. All you can"
do is go out and put on a good show
and know that you did your best,"
Besosa said.

In Hamada's opinion, the team
would not be in contention for the na
tional championship if not for Louis
and Besosa.
"They're two top all-arounders,
and they're very competitive —
there's a strong rivalry between
them," Hamada said. That rivalry
pushes the two gymnasts and inspires
the whole team, he added.
Louis agreed that his rivalry with
Besosa has benefited the team. "If
one of us improves, it gives incentive
for the other to improve," he said,
adding that Hamada is "one of the
best (coaches) in the country" and
has worked well with him and Besosa.
Louis added that a strong sense of
team unity and mutual encourage
ment has also contributed to the suc
cess of this year's team. In his first
year at Stanford, when the team was
traveling, Hamada would give indi
viduals meal money and each team
member would eat by himself, Louis
said. "Now we go out as a team," he
said, citing this as an example of the
team's attitude.
The success of this year's team has
also helped Hamada satisfy two
coaching ambitions: to be at the top
of NCAA competition and "to
produce as many international Olym
pians as possible."
On April 30, Louis will travel with
a team coached by Hamada to the In
ternational Sports Fair in Tokyo,
Japan, and Besosa will compete in
Czechoslovakia in a meet beginning
May 10.
Thanks to Louis and Besosa, the
Stanford gymnastics program "is
going in the right direction," accord
ing to Hamada. Louis "has had the
biggest impact on Stanford" because
of his decision to attend Stanford four
years ago, a move that attracted other
top gymnasts like Besosa to the
school and established Stanford as a
leading gymnastics school.
Last year the team finished seventh
among 10 teams at the NCAA cham
pionships in what Besosa called "the
first year we were really good."
At the beginning of this season,

coaching ambitions: to be at the top
of NCAA competition and "to
produce as many international Olym
pians as possible."
On April 30, Louis will travel with
a team coached by Hamada to the In
ternational Sports Fair in Tokyo,
Japan, and Besosa will compete in
Czechoslovakia in a meet beginning
May 10.
Thanks to Louis and Besosa, the
Stanford gymnastics program "is
going in the right direction," accord
ing to Hamada. Louis "has had the
biggest impact on Stanford" because
of his decision to attend Stanford four
years ago, a move that attracted other
top gymnasts like Besosa to the
school and established Stanford as a
leading gymnastics school.
Last year the team finished seventh
among 10 teams at the NCAA cham
pionships in what Besosa called "the
first year we were really good."
At the beginning of this season,
Besosa said he knew the team had the
potential to be even better. "I knew
we'd be good, but I didn't know how
good," he said. "Toward the middle
of the season, I knew we had some
thing."
"Last year, we wanted to make it
[to the NCAA meet]," Besosa said.
"This year we want to win it."

keys to the Stanford gymnastics program's emergence as a national
power. After a seventh-place finish last year, the Cardinal is ranked

second in the nation heading into this weekend's NCAA Championships
in Lincoln, Neb. Louis' 9.9 score in the floor exercise and Besosa's 9.9
on the horizontal bar are tops in these events in the nation this year.
