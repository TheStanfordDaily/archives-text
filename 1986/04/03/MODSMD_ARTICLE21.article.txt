# The 						Finest Five in NCAA hoops

A victory in a clutch game over
Denny Crum's Louisville Car
dinals is a rare bird indeed. Down
for most of the game, Louisville
stayed tough, kept abreast and
eventually clawed back to beat
Duke in the NCAA basketball
finals Monday night 72-69.
The Blue Devils had their
chances. Up by six with approxi
mately seven minutes remaining in
the game, Duke turned to stalling
tactics, Elmer glue style. Most of
the basketball world, Kukla, Fran,
Ollie and even Brent knew that it
could have been a poor move.
The result: Louisville grabbed
the highly-coveted momentum,
and Duke quietly perished.

Overall, it was a fitting end to an
exciting — and no doubt surpris
ing — tournament that saw the
likes of Auburn, Navy and
Cleveland State advance to the
sweet 16.
Fans on the Cleveland State
campus were especially thrilled,
receiving coverage from national
news networks. Referring to the
basketball team's NCAA success,
one unindentified Cleveland State
student said, "Now people know
where Cleveland State is."
Strange, I thought it was in
Toledo.
In a tournament where upstart
teams made headlines, several
players deserved special recogni
tion.
Guards: Johnny Dawkins
(Duke) and Scott Skiles (Michigan
State). Without question, Dawkins
improved his NBA stock with his
tourney performance. He com
pletely dominated opposing
guards, and in the championship
game, he made Louisville's Milt
Wagner look like dried silly putty.
Skiles could have made it on
one pass alone. Against George
town, Skiles swung the game with

an awe-inspiring behind-the-back
wrap-around look-off Triple
Salkow special. Skiles scores too
— usually from "distances longer
than his criminal record (Skiles
will soon be serving a two-week
jail term for violating probation),"
as Daily sports editor Tom Senf
poignantly put it.
Forwards: Chuck Person
(Auburn) and Billy Thompson
(Louisville). Quick and huge with
a Midas touch. Person combined
bulk and finesse to rack up im
pressive stats throughout the
NCAA championship games.
Just edging out Louisiana
State's John Williams, Thompson
led his team in tournament
scoring, and probably shone in the
eyes of once-skeptical NBA
scouts.
Center: David Robinson
(Navy). This one was the toughest
choice. Undoubtedly, Louisville's
Pervis "Never Nervous" Ellison
had a great showing, especially in
his MVP championship finish.
Still, Robinson deserved it.
Soaring for rebounds where
Sherpas dare not tread, Robinson
spearheaded the Midshipmen at
tack — most notably against
Syracuse, when he scored 35
points and blocked eight shots.
After discussing the best players
in the tournament, recounting deft
and agile maneuvers and skills, it's
difficult to mention the following
word. To be honest, it's a little
frightening, and I will not pretend
to say that I'm not afraid. 1 will say
it quickly. Here goes.
Pac-10.
We're safe now; it's over. I feel
better, truly. In all fairness to our
beloved Pac-10, both conference
representatives, Arizona and
Washington, lost to darkhorse
teams (Auburn and Michigan
State) that ultimately advanced to
the final 16.
But then again, the NIT — the
other guy.— has yet to be
scrutinized.
Editor's note: Whether Erik
EseUus neglected to mention the
outcome of the National Invitation
Tournament out of ignorance or
indifference is a matter for specula
tion. In any case, Ohio State won
the NIT hy heating Wyoming.
