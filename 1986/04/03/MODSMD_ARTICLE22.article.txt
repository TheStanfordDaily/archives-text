# Swimmers set to defend title
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind. — Today
marks the beginning of the end of the
men's swim season — the NCAA
Championships here at the
Natatorium. While Stanford students
are scoping out their spring quarter
classes, the swim team is preparing
for what Stanford Coach Skip Ken
ney called a "real dogfight," as the
Cardinal defends its 1985 NCAA
title against tough competition from
Florida and California.
Although Florida has more men
swimming more events than Stanford,
and although Cal is threatening in the
sprint freestyles, Kenney expressed
confidence in his team. "I wouldn't
trade our chances with anyone's," he
said.
One of Stanford's biggest plusses is
the fact that it won last year. As Ken
ney said, "We know how to win. You
have to know how to win before you
do it."
The Cardinal's record supports
Kenney's claim. Stanford has
captured Five consecutive Pacific 10
Conference Championships under his
tenure, and it has stacked up 45
straight dual meet victories. "I can
coach another 20 years and not get
this kind of talent," Kenney said.
Stanford's strength lies in its med
ley relay, distance freestyle and
stroke events. Senior John Moffet,
juniors Pablo Morales and Jeff Kos
toff and sophomore Sean Murphy
have won individual NCAA titles in
these areas. And in a few events, the
backup swimmers have a shot at win
ning.
Kenney values the team's
chemistry. "We have strong senior
leaders, and we fill in the holes with
enthusiastic freshmen."
The freshmen participating in the
NCAAs this year are distance free
stylers Bob Gavin and Robert Gene,
sprinter John Hodge, butterflier Jay
Mortenson and backstroker Kurt
Kroesche. Gavin and Gene can score
points for Stanford in the consolation
finals, and the relays depend a great
deal on Hodge's speed.
Mortenson has the chance to put to
use what he learned from teammates
Morales and Anthony Mosse in the
100-yard butterfly, and Kroesche can
score some bonus points in the 200
backstroke.
Sophomores Murphy. Mosse and
Matt Nance form a potent trio worth
several points to the Stanford squad.
Murphy is more than capable of

repeating last year's victory in the
200 backstroke, and he has shown a
lot of improvement in the 100 back
stroke as well. Kenney counts on his
consistency. "His stroke is always the
same and he's swimming fast."
Mosse is a favorite in the 200 but
terfly and can place in the top three in
the 100 butterfly. He's also very
valuable in the 800 free relay. Ken
ney called him a "real veteran" even
though this is only his second year at
Stanford. "You can never say enough
about Anthony," Kenney said. "His
experience and attitude has really
helped the younger guys."
Due to a midseason bout with
mononucleosis, Nance's performance
is questionable. But the coaches hope
he will place in the final round of the
400 individual medley.
Obviously prominent in the Card
inal lineup are Kostoff and Morales.
With a trail of honors behind them,
both swimmers face the pressure of
repeating previous outstanding per
formances. Running on the cross
country team has helped make this
the "best year ever" for Kostoff. Ac

cording to Kenney. He shows the skill
and endurance to win as many as
three individual titles, in the 500 and
1,650 freestyle and the 400 IM.
As Kenney put it, "Pablo
(Morales) is one of the studs." He
won the 100 and 200 butterfly last
year along with the 200 IM: it would
seem that he couldn't do any better
this time around. In addition to his
three championship events. Morales
will swim in two relays, and he should
supply the team with a steady stream
of points.
Add a pair of Daves to the already
solid Stanford roster, and its victory
prospects shine brighter. Junior
Louden adds depth to the freestyle
events, and Kenney "hopes he
reaches his potential at the NCAAs."
Senior Lundberg's diligence
combined with his improving speed in
his breaststroke events has made him
a "silent strength" for the Cardinal.
Kenney relies on his help in the 400
free relay.
Senior co-captains Mike Reynolds
and John Moffet powerfully round off
Stanford's NCAA swimmers.

Reynolds is competing in the 400 IM
and should score in the consolation
finals. Kenney lauds his leadership
skills, saying, "He cares about people
more than anyone else."
Moffet, perhaps the best
breaststroker in the world today, is
"one of the guys that gave this swim
program a positive start," Kenney
said. His record speaks for itself. He
has swum undefeated in dual meets
for four consecutive years and has
won four straight Pac-10 titles. Once
again, he has the opportunity to win
both breaststrokes, the 200 IM, and
contribute significantly to the 400
medley and free relays.
The Stanford team is completed by
senior divers Thor Johnson and Tom
Rothenbucher. Both divers take ex
perience to the Natatorium. and Ken
ney said. "They should add some
points in the three and one-meter
board events."
With a tight lineup and the added
edge of its status as returning cham
pion. Stanford should once again
bring home honors from Indiana.

After finishing second in both the 100 and 200-yard NCAA breaststrokes in his freshman year, Stanford
senior John Moffet has won both races each of the two seasons and is expected to do so again this weekend at
the NCAA Championships in Indianapolis, Ind.
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind. — Today
marks the beginning of the end of the
men's swim season — the NCAA
Championships here at the
Natatorium. While Stanford students
are scoping out their spring quarter
classes, the swim team is preparing
for what Stanford Coach Skip Ken
ney called a "real dogfight," as the
Cardinal defends its 1985 NCAA
title against tough competition from
Florida and California.
Although Florida has more men
swimming more events than Stanford,
and although Cal is threatening in the
sprint freestyles, Kenney expressed
confidence in his team. "I wouldn't
trade our chances with anyone's," he
said.
One of Stanford's biggest plusses is
the fact that it won last year. As Ken
ney said, "We know how to win. You
have to know how to win before you
do it."
The Cardinal's record supports
Kenney's claim. Stanford has
captured Five consecutive Pacific 10
Conference Championships under his
tenure, and it has stacked up 45
straight dual meet victories. "I can
coach another 20 years and not get
this kind of talent," Kenney said.
Stanford's strength lies in its med
ley relay, distance freestyle and
stroke events. Senior John Moffet,
juniors Pablo Morales and Jeff Kos
toff and sophomore Sean Murphy
have won individual NCAA titles in
these areas. And in a few events, the
backup swimmers have a shot at win
ning.
Kenney values the team's
chemistry. "We have strong senior
leaders, and we fill in the holes with
enthusiastic freshmen."
The freshmen participating in the
NCAAs this year are distance free
stylers Bob Gavin and Robert Gene,
sprinter John Hodge, butterflier Jay
Mortenson and backstroker Kurt
Kroesche. Gavin and Gene can score
points for Stanford in the consolation
finals, and the relays depend a great
deal on Hodge's speed.
Mortenson has the chance to put to
use what he learned from teammates
Morales and Anthony Mosse in the
100-yard butterfly, and Kroesche can
score some bonus points in the 200
backstroke.
Sophomores Murphy. Mosse and
Matt Nance form a potent trio worth
several points to the Stanford squad.
Murphy is more than capable of

repeating last year's victory in the
200 backstroke, and he has shown a
lot of improvement in the 100 back
stroke as well. Kenney counts on his
consistency. "His stroke is always the
same and he's swimming fast."
Mosse is a favorite in the 200 but
terfly and can place in the top three in
the 100 butterfly. He's also very
valuable in the 800 free relay. Ken
ney called him a "real veteran" even
