Treasury funds financed Marcos
MANILA, Philippines — Officials of deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos withdrew more than $150 million from the Philippine treasury
during the election period, presumably to finance his re-election cam
paign, government auditors reported yesterday.
Teofisto Guingona, head of the Commission on Audit, told a closed
Cabinet meeting that the withdrawals, nearly 3.12 billion pesos, were
made as cash advances, a presidential spokesman said.
Audit Commission sources said the advances were issued in Decem
ber and January, prior to the Feb. 7 election contest between Marcos
and now-President Corazon Aquino. An investigation is continuing on
the use of the funds, they said, but asserted that much of the money was
spent on the campaign.
Independent economic analysts have estimated Marcos' total cam
paign spending at more than $250 million, most of it distributed as cash
enticements to voters. The payoffs Hooded the nations already troubled
economy with so much money, it actually helped devalue the Philippine
peso, but the analysts so far have been unable to pinpoint the sources of
the funds.
In addition to the cash advances, Guingona's auditors have already
disclosed cash withdrawals from the national treasury personally or
dered by Marcos during the election campaign totaling about $5 million.
Those funds were drawn on accounts earmarked for government schools
and public works projects in underdeveloped Philippine villages.
Spokesman Rene Saguisag called the withdrawals "unliquidated ad
vances'* and said no new advances to the ministries involved would be
made until an accounting was completed.
White House won't talk to Khadafi
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration declared yesterday
that it has nothing to say to Libya, rejecting Col. Moammar Khadafi's
hints that he wants to discuss the Gulf of Sidra, terrorism and other
disputes between the two nations.
"There have been several published offers to mediate between the
United States and Libya," State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb
said. 'The United States has not responded because there has been no
need for mediation or go-betweens.
"If the Khadafi regime wants to improve its international accep
tability, it knows precisely what it must do," Kalb said. "It must cease its
unacceptable policies and actions and show it is prepared to become a
member of the civilized community. It must cease its support for ter
rorism. It is a lack of action, a lack of terrorist action, that is important."
Other U.S. officials said Khadafi repeatedly used European and
Middle Eastern intermediaries to ask for talks with Washington after the
Dec. 27 attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports that the United States
blamed on Libyan-supported terrorists. But the United States rebuffed
each of the overtures.
Khadafi's only success came in early January when William Wilson,
the U.S. envoy to the Vatican, met secretly with the Libyan leader.
The Administration stressed its refusal to talk to Khadafi before Vice
President George Bush's 10-day trip to the Arab countries around the
Persian Gulf, starting today in Saudi Arabia.
Soviet arms test violations in doubt
WASHINGTON — The Central Intelligence Agency has revised its
calculations of Soviet underground nuclear tests in a way that adds new
uncertainty to U.S. charges that Moscow probably violated a 1974 arms
control agreement, administration officials said yesterday.
The changes in U.S. measurements of Soviet nuclear tests are a result
of advances in seismology and improvements in assessing the differences
in geology between U.S. nuclear test sites and those of the Soviet Union,
an official said. Beyond the dense technicalities involved, the issue has
major political repercussions in view of sharply contested administration
charges of Soviet cheating on nuclear test limits and other obligations.
Some officials said yesterday that even under the new calculations it is
likely that several Soviet tests have gone over the limit of 150 kilotons
accepted in the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty. Other officials Said
there was already doubt among government and non-government scien
tists that the Soviets violated the limits and that the CIA adjustment
makes it even harder to draw such a conclusion.
I he 1974 treaty, concluded by the Nixon Administration, has never
been ratified by the United States. Like other unratified agreements,
both sides have accepted an obligation not to undercut it.
Officials of several U.S. agencies said the CI A revision, which took ef
fect in January, resulted from recommendations last fall of separate sci
entific panels on Soviet test measurements under the sponsorship of two
Defense Department organizations, the Advanced Research Projects
Agency and the Air Force Technical Applications Center.
White House spokesman Larry'Speakes said in Santa Barbara, follow
ing the first report of the change in Wednesday's New York Times, "We
haven't changed our method for estimating yields of Soviet tests. As a
part of the verification process, we are constantly refining our techniques
to improve our understanding of Soviet testing activities."
While fewer tests turn out to be violations under the new calculations,
Perle said, there should be greater confidence that those remaining were
actually above the agreed limits.
Honduran leniency inspired raid
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The Nicaraguan army staged last week's
large-scale raid against anti-Sandinista rebel bases in Honduras in part
to punish the Honduran government for recently having relaxed restric
tions on the rebels activities there, Nicaraguan officials and foreign
diplomats reported.
In early March, Honduras allowed the rebels, who are known ascon
tras, to resume using several infiltration routes into Nicaragua that were
prohibited since late last year, these sources said. The routes allow the
contras to operate closer to major population centers in Nicaragua.
A strong reaction by the Reagan Administration, which was ulti
mately able to persuade the Hondurans to protest publicly about the
raid, appears to have surprised the Sandinistas, and probably will make
them more cautious about staging similar incursions, according to
several diplomats here.
I he U.S. response will be "a short-term deterrent for more incur
sions." a high-ranking envoy said.
The Sandinista army launched the incursion 11 days ago because of
circumstances at the time and not because of a new policy of ignoring the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border altogether, Nicaraguan officials and
foreign diplomats said. They said Nicaragua was unlikely to stage similar
raids on a regular basis because such attacks would risk triggering a con
flict with Honduran and U.S. forces.
The allegedly reactivated routes, about 75 miles west of the contras'
main base camps where the incursion took place, allow the contras to en
ter Nicaragua much closer to major population centers in this country's
northern provinces of Nueva Segovia. Madriz and Fsteli.
Bulgarian leader promises changes
SOFIA. Bulgaria — Communist leader fodor Zhivkov promised
"radical transformations of economic policy here yesterday at a Bul
garian party congress that is also expected to consolidate moderate
changes in political leadership under pressure from Soviet party chief
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Zhi\ kov, whose close relations with Moscow have been strained since
Gorbachev took power last year, said Bulgaria would decentralize man
agement. toughen discipline and link workers' pay to performance in
economic reforms potentially more dramatic than those planned by Gor
bachev for the Soviet Union.
