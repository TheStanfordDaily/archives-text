### 
ATHENS — Four Americans were killed and
nine persons, including five Americans, were
injured yesterday in an explosion, apparently
caused by a bomb aboard a TWA Boeing 727 air
liner en route from Rome to Athens.
TWA officials said the blast took place at 2:32
p.m. local time (6:32 a.m. EST), southwest of Ath
ens, as the plane was descending at 15,000 feet
before landing. The plane, with a 3-by-4-foot hole
in its right side just before the wing, landed nor
mally at 2:40 p.m.
Officials said they had received no threats
against TWA Flight 840,-which originated Tuesday
morning in Los Angeles. One anonymous tele
phone call in Beirut yesterday claimed that a bomb
had been placed aboard the aircraft by a pro-
Libyan Palestinian group called the Ezzedine Kas

sum unit of the Arab Revolutionary Cells in retalia
tion tor "U.S. imperialism . . . including its attack
against Libya" last week. State Department offi
cials said the group was unknown to them.
Coming nine days after the U.S.-Libyan con
frontation in the Gulf of Sidra, the apparent bomb
ing raised questions of possible retaliation by
Libyan leader Moammar Khadafi or Islamic ex
tremist groups he is said to support. It follows a se
ries of terrorist attacks beginning with the hijacking
last summer of a TW A jet to Beirut, where its U.S.
passengers were held hostage for 17 days.
But Khadafi denied any role in yesterday's ex-
"This is an act of terrorism against a civil
ian target, and 1 am totally against this. 1 reject
this," he said in an interview with United Press In
ternational in Tripoli.

The four dead, including three Annapolis, Md.,
residents — a Greek-born widow, her daughter and
8-month-old granddaughter — were sucked from
the aircraft through the hole caused by the explo
sion. Their bodies were found by shepherds six
miles outside the town of Argos.
Charles Adams, vice president for TWA's inter
national division who flew here last night from
London to head the company's investigation, said
he could not be absolutely certain yet that a bomb
caused the explosion. But he made clear that this
was the firm belief of both the company and Greek
authorities.
Officials agreed that the rest of the passengers
were spared because the explosion took place at a
relatively low altitude, where outside pressure was
low at approximately four pounds per square inch.
