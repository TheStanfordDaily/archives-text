# Court ends Winnie Mandela ban
## Meanwhile, Bishop Tutu calls for economic sanctions against S. Africa 
### 
SOWETO, South Africa — The
South African government yesterday
abandoned restrictions on Winnie
Mandela, wife of imprisoned black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela,
ending 24 years of almost continuous
confinement.
In another major development yes
terday, Bishop Desmond Tutu, the
1984 Nobel peace laureate, joined
the call for economic sanctions
against South Africa, saying he had
"no hope" that the white minority
government would dismantle the
apartheid system of segregation un
less forced.
It was the first time Bishop Tutu
called for punitive economic sanc
tions on South Africa, risking
criminal prosecution under the
country's security laws.
The end of the restrictions on Man
dela follows a test-case judgment in
South Africa's highest court, the Ap
peal Court, two weeks ago that has
thrown the government's controver
sial system of bannings and deten
tions without trial into disarray.
Moments after officials told Man
dela's lawyers that they were aban
doning the restrictions on her, the
black nationalist leader's wife headed

back to her family home in Soweto
from which the latest order, issued in
December, had banned her.
Bishop Tutu, who is the Anglican
bishop of Johannesburg, said at a
press conference yesterday that he

had decided to call for economic
sanctions after 10 years of fruitless at
tempts to persuade the government
to relinquish white domination,
"Nothing (President Pieter) Botha
has said has made me believe he and

his government are serious about dis
mantling apartheid," Tutu said. "We
face a catastrophe in this land, and
only the action of the international
community by applying pressure can
save us."
Tutu said he was not directing his
appeal to President Reagan or British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
"I put my hopes on the young, espe
cially at the American universities, to
exert the pressure," he said.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Kalb said, "The United
States does not believe that punitive
sanctions will help promote change in
South Africa. ... In the U.S. view,
punitive sanctions would hurt South
Africa's economy."
Describing arguments by oppo
nents of sanctions that they would
hurt blacks more than whites as
hypocritical, Tutu said it was
"amazing how everybody has become
so solicitous for blacks and become
such wonderful altruists."
It was also remarkable that "those
most vehement in their concern for
blacks have been whites," he said,
while two recent surveys showed
more than 70 percent of blacks sup
ported sanctions.
