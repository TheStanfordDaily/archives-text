George Wallace retires
MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Gov. George
Wallace, the one-time segregationist firebrand
who has dominated Alabama politics for nearly a
quarter-century, from the turbulent civil-rights
era to the Sun Belt boom, announced tearfully
yesterday that he would not seek a fifth term.
"1 feel that 1 must say I've climbed my last po
litical mountain," he told a packed crowd in the
same House chamber where he served in his first
elected state office in 1947.
Wallace, 66, has been beset both by ill health
and declining political popularity in statewide
public opinion polls. The governor, who has been
hospitalized seven times since winning a fourth
term in 1982, said the assassination attempt by
Arthur Bremer in 1972 that left him paralyzed
from the waist down had taken its toll.
Wallace's announcement rang down the cur
tain on one of the South's most enduring political
dramas and leaves a crowded field of challengers
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
The charismastic governor, who built a reputa
tion as an indefatigable campaigner and astute
politician who managed to change with the
changing times, has kept his state guessing for
months about whether he would try to remain in
the white-columned governor's mansion for an
other four years.
Up until the moment of his announcement,
speculation was rampant that he would go against
the odds and seek re-election this year.
Tears welled in Wallace's eyes and his voice
grew choked with emotion as he announced that
he would be stepping down after this term.

Stable oil prices sought
WASHINGTON — The White House, back
ing away from remarks Tuesday by Vice Presi
dent George Bush, reaffirmed yesterday that the
Administration does not intend to interfere with
the movement of world oil prices.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
yesterday the Administration believes that mar
ket forces should determine the price of oil.
"There has been no change in administration
policy or viewpoint on the decline in oil prices, ,,
Speakes said.
"While we are concerned with the effects of
falling prices on oil-producing sectors of the U.S.
economy, the net effect for American consumers
and the American economy will be positive,"
Speakes said at a press briefing in Santa Barbara,
where President Reagan is vacationing.
Bush told a news conference Tuesday that he
would make a plea for stability in oil prices when
he met with leaders of Saudi Arabia this
weekend. Bush, a former Texas congressman and
former oil-industry entrepreneur, also expressed
concern Tuesday about the impact of plummet
ing oil prices on the U.S. energy industry, saying
its health was vital to national security.
On the basis of Bush's remarks, oil prices
jumped sharply higher Tuesday on commodities
markets. Yesterday, after Speakes spoke to
reporters, futures prices fell again by nearly $1 a
barrel, closing in New York at $ I 1.52.
In another development, administration offi
cials said a high-level task force has been estab
lished to look at the national security implica
tions of plunging oil prices. Among the questions

being considered is whether the government
should buy domestic oil, perhaps at above
market prices, for the 500 million-barrel Strate
gic Petroleum Reserve, both as a hedge against
market disruptions and as a mechanism to prop
up the sagging domestic industry.
Payola probe to begin
WASHINGTON — Claiming that payola is
"alive and well and worse than ever" in the
nation's recording industry. Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
(D-Tenn.) yesterday announced a congressional
investigation into alleged illicit practices used to
promote records.
"The cumulative evidence is overwhelming
that this practice has gotten completely out of
hand and has come to dominate some portions of
the industry in their decisions as to what records
got on the air and which ones didn't," Gore told a
news conference.
The Senate thus joins federal, California and
New York law enforcement agencies in what has
become a virtual stampede to investigate allega
tions of organized crime influence in the $4
billion-a-year U.S. recording industry.
Market finishes mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market bounced
back from an early selloff to finish mixed yester
day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down more than 12 points in early trading, was
up 5.15 at 1,795.26 by the close.

yesterday the Administration believes that mar
ket forces should determine the price of oil.
"There has been no change in administration
policy or viewpoint on the decline in oil prices, ,,
Speakes said.
"While we are concerned with the effects of
falling prices on oil-producing sectors of the U.S.
economy, the net effect for American consumers
and the American economy will be positive,"
Speakes said at a press briefing in Santa Barbara,
where President Reagan is vacationing.
Bush told a news conference Tuesday that he
would make a plea for stability in oil prices when
he met with leaders of Saudi Arabia this
weekend. Bush, a former Texas congressman and
former oil-industry entrepreneur, also expressed
concern Tuesday about the impact of plummet
ing oil prices on the U.S. energy industry, saying
its health was vital to national security.
On the basis of Bush's remarks, oil prices
jumped sharply higher Tuesday on commodities
markets. Yesterday, after Speakes spoke to
reporters, futures prices fell again by nearly $1 a
barrel, closing in New York at $ I 1.52.
In another development, administration offi
cials said a high-level task force has been estab
lished to look at the national security implica
tions of plunging oil prices. Among the questions

being considered is whether the government
should buy domestic oil, perhaps at above
market prices, for the 500 million-barrel Strate
gic Petroleum Reserve, both as a hedge against
market disruptions and as a mechanism to prop
up the sagging domestic industry.
Payola probe to begin
WASHINGTON — Claiming that payola is
"alive and well and worse than ever" in the
nation's recording industry. Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
(D-Tenn.) yesterday announced a congressional
investigation into alleged illicit practices used to
promote records.
"The cumulative evidence is overwhelming
that this practice has gotten completely out of
hand and has come to dominate some portions of
the industry in their decisions as to what records
got on the air and which ones didn't," Gore told a
news conference.
The Senate thus joins federal, California and
New York law enforcement agencies in what has
become a virtual stampede to investigate allega
tions of organized crime influence in the $4
billion-a-year U.S. recording industry.
