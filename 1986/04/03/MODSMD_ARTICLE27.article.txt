Military overseer sought
SANTA BARBARA — President Reagan, at
tempting to rebuild confidence in his defense
budget, will ask Congress to create a new Pent
agon position to oversee the acquisiton and cost
of everything from major weapons systems to in
cidentals like hammers, coffeepots and ashtrays,
Administration officials said yesterday.
The new position would carry the title of Un
der Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, the
third-highest rank in the Department of Defense.
Whoever is chosen for the job "should have a
solid industrial background," said a White House
fact sheet released to reporters.
The proposed position was announced as part
of a presidential directive to implement virtually
all of the recommendations of a blue-ribbon
commission on defense management. The panel
was created last June in response to a series of
embarrassing disclosures about Pentagon pur
chases of $435 hammers and other spending
abuses.

Reagan will also ask Congress to strengthen
the hand of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
staff in order to make the position "more inde
pendent in the formulation of military strategy,"
an official said.
The official, who declined to he identified, said
the move would allow the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs to make decisions in an atmosphere that is
"less constrained by interservice rivalries."
Reagan is fighting to protect his defense
buildup from cutbacks by Congress, where
balanced-budget legislation has made congress
men reluctant to endorse higher defense spend
ing at the same time they are forced to trim
spending for domestic programs.
Spitball meal spurs rage
NORCO — A city councilman, using the city
attorney as private counsel, is suing the school
district for $ 1 million, alleging a bus driver forced
the councilman's 7-year-old son to eat spitballs

off the bus' floor.
Young Jason Wildfong was riding home from
school last Oct. 24 when, according to the suit
filed Friday in Riverside Superior Court, bus
driver Suzan Garrett stopped the bus near the
Wildfong home and grabbed the youngster by the
collar.
Councilman Ronald Wildfong contends Jason
choked and gasped for air, and the incident
caused him "great mental, physical and nervous
pain and suffering."
Wildfong alleges that Garrett made Jason
pick up six or seven spitballs from the floor of the
bus and swallow them and that she "roughly
shoved and forced" Jason to the front of the bus
and out the door.
Today's weather
Today will be sunny with highs in the 60s to
lower 70s and westerly winds of 10 to 20 mph.
Long-range forecast is for rain and miserable
cold during the Beta Nooner.
