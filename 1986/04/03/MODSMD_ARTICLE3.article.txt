# Fundless coaches look for new money sources
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford Athletic Department's decision
last month to eliminate funding for five varsity
sports has met with negative reaction from al
most everyone involved and has sent the
coaches of the sports scrambling to find new
outside funds.
Beginning next fall, the wrestling, men's and
women's fencing, women's field hockey and
women's softball teams will no longer receive
operating funds from the Athletic Department
and will not be able to give out any new scholar
ships.
The cuts are aimed at reducing a projected
$2.3 million Athletic Department budget deficit
over the next four years.
"It's a sad thing to have to do," Athletic

Director Andy Geiger said yesterday. 'These
sports are 1 non-recruited, and students can come
on to Stanford, work hard and make the team.
"We are going to try our hardest to still keep
at least four of these programs alive," Geiger
said, adding that he is not optimistic that the
softball team can continue without funding.
However, Fencing Coach Buzz Hurst said
Tuesday night that he has received no as
surances that his teams will survive the cuts
either.
"I was told by Mr. Geiger that varsity fencing
and fencing classes are going to be totally
eliminated," Hurst said. "By wiping out the
classes he removes our financial base.
"He (Geiger) wasn't prepared to discuss any
thing," Hurst continued. "It was an announce-
rnent, not a discussion."
Geiger, who has been away from
Stanford for a few weeks, responded
by saying, "1 haven't had a chance to
talk to him (Hurst) in over two
weeks, but 1 am going to talk to him
about some creative possibilities to
keep the (fencing) program going.
"We have to examine if we can af
ford one-and-a-half billets for fencing
as far as personnel is concerned,"
Geiger said.
Hurst said that if Geiger will allow
the fencing program to continue, the
coach may be able to find a way to
finance-it even without department
funds.
"The fencing program has the
second-largest booster club on
campus," Hurst said. "If we had any
good-faith indication that Geiger
wanted to keep the program, then 1
think we could do it. But we haven't
had any word."
According to Geiger, the root of
this whole problem — the budget def
icit — is a combination of the high

cost of athletics and Stanford's failure
to get enough revenue from tickets or
television contracts.
The department will soon be at
work trying to solve the budget prob
lems.
"If the management of the depart
ment has to get smaller — and Stan
ford's has been one of the few that
has been getting smaller — then it
will," Geiger said. "We're going to
examine the budgets of all the sports,
search for new income, try to write
some better TV contracts and put all
the energy we can into fund-raising
events."
Meanwhile, there has been concern
that the elimination of these sports
could hurt Western sports in general.
The Air Force Academy and the Uni
versity of Texas at San Antonio are
the only other NCAA teams in the
West that sponsor fencing teams. In
addition, Stanford is only one of five
western schools to have a women's
field hockey team.
Some fear that if these Cardinal
programs expire, the condition of the
sports at the other Western schools
could be shaken.
"I've heard that the United States

Fencing Association and the U.S.
Olympic Committee have sent letters
to the Stanford administration about
the cuts," Hurst said.
Geiger said he understands the
problem, but said, "Is it our responsi
bility to keep these sports alive when
other schools aren't? How deep a
responsiblity is it to be the only kid on
the block?"
Another question floating around
campus is how these specific sports
were chosen to be cut.
"The reasons we choose to sponsor
a team are many and varied," Geiger
said. "Competing in the Pac-10 is a
key factor.
"Only four schools in the Pac-10
have wrestling programs. It's not a
sport on the collegiate level that's
growing — in fact, it's going in the
other direction," Geiger said.
"Fencing is the same way.
"On the other hand, we elected to
keep women's soccer because it's a
very popular high school sport and it
seems to be growing," Geiger said.
"The reasons are not illogical if you
stop and think about it."
In any case, the coaches are
looking for some ways to raise money

on their own. Kathy Lincoln, the
women's softball coach, said she
has been contacted by some people
who want to help the program.
'Right now we're trying to drum
up support, and we're hoping to raise
money from summer camps," she
said.
"We're counting on the fact that so
many people play softball recreation
ally, and also that the collegiate level
for women is the highest caliber
softball in the country," Lincoln said.
The softball program does have a
booster club— the Hit and Run Club
— and Lincoln is hoping that it will
grow.
Without any administration fund
ing, however. Lincoln isn't sure that
her team will be able to continue
playing a Pac-10 schedule.
"Whether we continue playing in
the Pac-10 also depends on recruits,"
Lincoln said. " If we can't get the per
sonnel, then we may just play a local
schedule."
The softball program has never
been able to offer scholarships.
The wrestling team will now rely
heavily on an alumni support group,
the Friends of Stanford Wrestling.

Geiger said he understands the
problem, but said, "Is it our responsi
bility to keep these sports alive when
other schools aren't? How deep a
responsiblity is it to be the only kid on
the block?"
Another question floating around
campus is how these specific sports
were chosen to be cut.
"The reasons we choose to sponsor
a team are many and varied," Geiger
said. "Competing in the Pac-10 is a
key factor.
"Only four schools in the Pac-10
have wrestling programs. It's not a
sport on the collegiate level that's
growing — in fact, it's going in the
other direction," Geiger said.
"Fencing is the same way.
"On the other hand, we elected to
keep women's soccer because it's a
very popular high school sport and it
seems to be growing," Geiger said.
"The reasons are not illogical if you
stop and think about it."
In any case, the coaches are
looking for some ways to raise money

on their own. Kathy Lincoln, the
women's softball coach, said she
has been contacted by some people
who want to help the program.
'Right now we're trying to drum
up support, and we're hoping to raise
money from summer camps," she
said.
"We're counting on the fact that so
many people play softball recreation
ally, and also that the collegiate level
for women is the highest caliber
softball in the country," Lincoln said.
The softball program does have a
booster club— the Hit and Run Club
— and Lincoln is hoping that it will
grow.
Without any administration fund
ing, however. Lincoln isn't sure that
her team will be able to continue
playing a Pac-10 schedule.
"Whether we continue playing in
the Pac-10 also depends on recruits,"
Lincoln said. " If we can't get the per
sonnel, then we may just play a local
schedule."
The softball program has never
been able to offer scholarships.
The wrestling team will now rely
heavily on an alumni support group,
the Friends of Stanford Wrestling.
The Stanford Athletic Department's decision
last month to eliminate funding for five varsity
sports has met with negative reaction from al
most everyone involved and has sent the
coaches of the sports scrambling to find new
outside funds.
Beginning next fall, the wrestling, men's and
women's fencing, women's field hockey and
women's softball teams will no longer receive
operating funds from the Athletic Department
and will not be able to give out any new scholar
ships.
The cuts are aimed at reducing a projected
$2.3 million Athletic Department budget deficit
over the next four years.
"It's a sad thing to have to do," Athletic

Director Andy Geiger said yesterday. 'These
sports are 1 non-recruited, and students can come
on to Stanford, work hard and make the team.
"We are going to try our hardest to still keep
at least four of these programs alive," Geiger
said, adding that he is not optimistic that the
softball team can continue without funding.
However, Fencing Coach Buzz Hurst said
Tuesday night that he has received no as
surances that his teams will survive the cuts
either.
"I was told by Mr. Geiger that varsity fencing
and fencing classes are going to be totally
eliminated," Hurst said. "By wiping out the
classes he removes our financial base.
"He (Geiger) wasn't prepared to discuss any
thing," Hurst continued. "It was an announce-
rnent, not a discussion."
Geiger, who has been away from
Stanford for a few weeks, responded
by saying, "1 haven't had a chance to
talk to him (Hurst) in over two
weeks, but 1 am going to talk to him
about some creative possibilities to
keep the (fencing) program going.
"We have to examine if we can af
ford one-and-a-half billets for fencing
as far as personnel is concerned,"
Geiger said.
Hurst said that if Geiger will allow
the fencing program to continue, the
coach may be able to find a way to
finance-it even without department
funds.
"The fencing program has the
second-largest booster club on
campus," Hurst said. "If we had any
good-faith indication that Geiger
wanted to keep the program, then 1
think we could do it. But we haven't
had any word."
According to Geiger, the root of
this whole problem — the budget def
icit — is a combination of the high

cost of athletics and Stanford's failure
to get enough revenue from tickets or
television contracts.
The department will soon be at
work trying to solve the budget prob
lems.
"If the management of the depart
ment has to get smaller — and Stan
ford's has been one of the few that
has been getting smaller — then it
will," Geiger said. "We're going to
examine the budgets of all the sports,
search for new income, try to write
some better TV contracts and put all
the energy we can into fund-raising
events."
Meanwhile, there has been concern
that the elimination of these sports
could hurt Western sports in general.
The Air Force Academy and the Uni
versity of Texas at San Antonio are
the only other NCAA teams in the
West that sponsor fencing teams. In
addition, Stanford is only one of five
western schools to have a women's
field hockey team.
Some fear that if these Cardinal
programs expire, the condition of the
sports at the other Western schools
could be shaken.
"I've heard that the United States

Fencing Association and the U.S.
Olympic Committee have sent letters
to the Stanford administration about
the cuts," Hurst said.
Geiger said he understands the
problem, but said, "Is it our responsi
bility to keep these sports alive when
