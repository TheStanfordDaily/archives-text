also holds the Mazer chair for history and the

Funkenstein has researched the historical
conceptions that have formed Jewish belief

to the Enlightenment, and the influence of

scientific thinking.
"Stanford was the last major university
without a Jewish studies program,"
Funkenstein said. "There is growing need for

resources at UC-Berkeley will provide the
foundation to this program, " Funkenstein

20,000 scholarly volumes will provide the

largest and finest collection of books on
Jewish culture, history and religion. The li
