### FELICIA PAIK Staff writer 
A new Jewish studies program which will
include English, history and religious studies
classes has been launched with the first ap
pointment to the Daniel Koshland chair.
Amos Funkenstein, who is a professor at
UCLA, has been named the first professor of
Jewish culture and history, starting with the

Feature

1986-87 school year. The Koshland chair
was established by the Board of Trustees in
December 1983, in honor of Daniel Kosh
land, the late San Francisco community
leader and philanthropist.
Funkenstein presently teaches Jewish his
tory and medieval intellectual history. He
also holds the Mazer chair for history and the
philosophy of science at Tel Aviv University
in Israel.
Funkenstein has researched the historical
conceptions that have formed Jewish belief
and behavior, the relation between Jewish
and Christian thought from the Middle Ages
to the Enlightenment, and the influence of

theological notions on the development of
scientific thinking.
"Stanford was the last major university
without a Jewish studies program,"
Funkenstein said. "There is growing need for
study in this area. I think major impulses
(from the academic environment) induced
them to install a program.
"I want students to read every text of his
tory and be able to understand the problems
of every period. The new library along with
resources at UC-Berkeley will provide the
foundation to this program, " Funkenstein
said.
Stanford's Taube-Baron collection of
20,000 scholarly volumes will provide the
necessary basis for research and study in the
Jewish studies program. It is regarded as the
largest and finest collection of books on
Jewish culture, history and religion. The li
brary previously belonged to Salo Wittmayer
Baron, emeritus professor of history at Co
lumbia University.
The Jewish studies program will encom
pass the study of history, economics, society,
literature, languages, anthropology, politics
and religion of the Jewish people
from ancient to modern times.
Courses will be drawn from various
departments to coordinate a diverse
but coherent program.
"Funkenstein is a scholar
remarkable for both the depth and
breadth of his learning," said Norman
Wessells, dean of humanities and
sciences. "His presence will have a

dramatic impact upon Stanford's
emerging Jewish studies prgram, but
his influence will also be felt far
beyond that, extending into the his
tory of science and medieval studies.
"I can think of no better way to
build our venture in Jewish studies
than to bring one of the world's
recognized leading scholars here,
around whom we can build a vigorous
and exciting research program. The
arrival at Stanford of a scholar of
Prof. Funkenstein's stature will have
an impact on the entire Bay Area
community of scholars."
