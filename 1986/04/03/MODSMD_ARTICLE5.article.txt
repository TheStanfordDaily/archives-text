# Berkeley students rebuild shanty
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A shantytown was rebuilt yesterday on
the steps of the UC-Berkeley administration
building after the university failed to get a
temporary restraining order against anti
apartheid activists on that campus.
However. Berkeley anti-apartheid dem
onstrators anticipated that campus police
would once again tear down the shanties and
arrest protesters who refused to abandon
the structures Jast night, according to Chris
Krueger. university editor for The Daily
Californian.
At about 1 1 last night, the UC-
Berkeley vice chancellor read about 500
protesters gathered around the shanties in
front of the building a warning that the uni
versity considered the new shanties a fire
hazard and would raze the structures if the
demonstrators did not remove them. He
added that the administration would be will
ing to discuss relocating the shanties this
morning, according to Krueger.
Sixty-one anti-apartheid demonstrators,
including 21 Berkeley students, were ar
rested early Tuesday moring after UC-
Berkeley police tore down about 12 shanties
blocking entrances to the same building,
California Hall. The shantytown Monday
had been declared a fire hazard by the
Berkeley campus fire marshal!.
Seeking to prohibit reconstruction of the
shanty and to limit the activities of the anti-

apartheid movement there, UC-Berkeley
administrators yesterday appealed to the
Alameda County Superior Court for a
restraining order against 11 individuals,
three campus anti-apartheid groups and
"anyone acting in concert with them,"
Krueger said.
The order the university sought was
"really broad" in its attempt to limit campus
anti-apartheid activity, and the judge
allowed Berkeley only the right to prohibit
activity that presented a fire hazard or dis
rupted "the educational process," Krueger
said.
The university had tried to restrict the ac
tivities of the Campaign Against Apartheid,
the United People of Color and the UC Di
vestment Coalition, Krueger said.
Those campus groups have presented
Berkeley administration with a list of 14
demands, including total divestment of uni
versity financial interests in South Africa
and institution of an ethnic studies gradua
tion requirement.
The anti-apartheid groups are very upset
about the university's recent actions and are
"essentially saying the police are to blame"
for the confrontation at California Hall.
Krueger said.
In response to the renewed protest, UC-
Berkeley administrators have called in
police from other UC campuses, according
to Krueger.
"A lot of people are very angry." he said,
adding that he thought that Berkeley would

not allow a long sit-in such as Berkeley stu
dents held last spring on the steps of Sproul
Hall, another Berkeley administration
building.
Krueger said the situation last night was
very similar to events that led up to the 61
arrests Tuesday morning.
In that incident, the protesters, many of
whom barricaded themselves in the shanties
and tried to beat back police with sticks,
were cited with misdemeanors of trespassing
and resisting arrest. All but two, who
refused to give their names to police, were
released immediately, according to UC-
Berkeley spokesperson Tom Debley.
The Berkeley campus fire marshal Mon
day had declared California Hall "a severe
fire hazard due to the combustible nature of
the shanties" and said the shanties were il
legally blocking entrances to the building.
The plywood, cloth and cardboard
structures are intended to call attention to
the living conditions of black South Africans
and protest $2.4 billion of UC system stock
in companies that do business in South
Africa.
Before the police moved in Tuesday, As
sistant Chancellor John Cummings told the
demonstrators in the shanties that the fire
marshal had declared the structures a fire
hazard and said the University was willing to
help erect new shanties at "a mutually
agreeable location." Two shanties were
nailed to the doors of the building, accord
ing to Debley.
