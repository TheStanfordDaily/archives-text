Stanford Action for Nuclear Dis
armament will protest President
Reagan's "Star Wars" defense plan
on April 21 in White Plaza, according
to STAND spokesman Scott Boh
ning.
Several speakers, among them
John Harris, the director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, will
be present at the demonstration.
The anti-Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI) rally is part of a continuing
national effort being coordinated by
the National Student Action Center
in Washington, D.C.
The rally was originally scheduled
for Tuesday, April Fools Day, as part
of the nationwide campaign covering
53 different university campuses, in
cluding Stanford, Harvard, UC-
Berkeley and Cornell.
The rally was scheduled for April
Fools Day, Bohning said, because
the American public is being
"fooled" about the whole "Star
Wars" project.
"Four or five billion dollars per
year is being spent just for research,"
Bohning said. "You can imagine the

fraud and gold-plating that goes on.
"Silicon Valley basically exists to
promote technological and electronic
advances for the military. Stanford
just got an $8 million contract to re
search a free-electron laser, which is
to be the main weapon of S Dl," Boh
ning also said.
Stanford's April Fools Day in
volvement, however, was limited to
STAND members passing out anti-
SDI leaflets to passersby. "This is the
first day of classes, so we figured
there wouldn't be much turnout,"
Bohning said. STAND members
carried umbrellas while passing out
their leaflets, the umbrellas symboliz
ing protesters' belief that SDI will be
ineffective.
"SDI will protect you about as
much as an umbrella will — and
umbrellas don't cost over a trillion
dollars!" Bohning said.
"A perfect astrodome defense is
not a realistic thing," STAND quotes
Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, direc
tor of the SDI office, as saying.
STAND contends that even a "99
percent effective sysem, beyond the
most optimistic plans, would mean
tens ol millions of immediate
deaths."
STAND attempts to achieve its
goals in tour ways: gather signatures
from scientists pledging non
participation in "Star Wars" re
search, educate students about arms
control and disarmament issues
through rallies such as the April
Pools Day demonstration; investi-

gate alternatives to weapons-oriented
careers for graduates; and develop a
phone network that promotes "timely
and effective contact with Congress."
"It's (SDI) not in my line,"
Bohning said, "but important enough
I feel I have to do something about it.
The arms race, 'Star Wars,' and the
threat of nuclear winter won't just go
away."
About 300 demonstrators, many of
whom carried similar torn umbrellas,
participated in an anti-SDI April
Fools rally Tuesday at UC-Berkeley.
