## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Prepare for earthquakes 
### 
Although the temblors that have recently shaken the
Bay Area have caused very little damage to the Stan
ford community, they have served to remind all of us
here of our vulnerability to any natural disaster, and of
our particular susceptibility to earthquakes.
Those of us who were here in the spring two years
ago can vividly recall the quake (6.2 on the Richter
scale) that was centered roughly 30 miles away, near
San Jose. Despite the distance, that tremor gave this
campus quite a good shaking. Last January, a 5.2
tremor centered near the tiny town of Hollister, about
50 miles south of Stanford, was also felt on the Farm.
And of course, the early morning surprise that
rippled through the campus Monday was centered only
about 15 miles away in Fremont and registered 5.3 on
the Richter scale.
Obviously, Stanford's proximity to the San Andreas
Fault — the large fault line which runs up and down
California — puts those of us here in a high-risk situa
tion with regards to earthquakes. Many seismologists
have hinted that the recent quake activity could be an
indication that a larger, more destructive quake could
occur on the San Andreas Fault in the near future.
California, as just about everybody knows, is the
home of earthquakes, and while it obviously isn't ne
cessary to harbor an abnormal paranoia about a large
and very serious earthquake, it would not hurt any of
us to be more prepared for one.
It is time for the University to take the lead in
launching a campaign to make students, faculty and
staff more aware of the potential for a serious
earthquake here, and more importantly, what to do in
the event of one.

How many of us really know what to do in an
earthquake? If you live in a dorm or campus residence,
has the procedure for an earthquake ever been dis
cussed, much less practiced? The same questions apply
to faculty offices and departments and any University
building.
The University should require that campus residents
and administrators develop a serious earthquake plan,
and a more genuine effort should be made to make
campus residents informed about earthquake proce
dure.
If earthquake drills seem a bit too much — and we
all should realize that any inconvenience or annoyance
associated with drills is a small price to pay for the
knowledge that could save a life later on — then at
least dorm and department discussions or published in
formation sheets for each campus structure would be
better than nothing at ail.
As it stands now, there appears to be very little in
formation about how students and faculty should react
in the event of an earthquake here on the Farm. In the
spring 1984 tremor, which ocurred at the start of 1:15
classes, most individuals froze in their tracks during the
quake, and they made no effort to take cover until after
the shaking had ended.
And if the Univereity does not take the lead in re
quiring dorms and campus buildings to develop and
publicize earthquake plans, then, perhaps, the burden
falls on us — the Stanford community. We should all
take the time to think about the logical way to react in
an unusual and frightening situation. The time to start
thinking isn't when the moment is upon us.
