Libyan edit wrong
On the good side, yesterday's edi
torial (Daily, April 2) on Reagan's
"Libyan action" demonstrated that
neither American universities nor the
media are monopolized by fuzzy
headed liberals. On the bad side, the
editorial showed that both American
universities and the media have their
share of fuzzy-headed conservatives.
For example, the editorial claimed
that the action "was the only way the
United States could assert its right to
navigate in international waters."
Given that the Reagan Administration
had denied the jurisdiction of the
World Court — because it didn't en
joy having its own violations of inter
national law in Central America
pointed out to it — I think it doesn't
have any right to be sanctimonious.
Furthermore, The Daily
editorialized that failing to provoke
Khadafi would have increased ter
rorism, "since terrorists around the
world would have received the
message that the U.S. is reluctant to
retaliate." I side, though, with former
national security adviser Robert
McFarlane, who in a recent interview
admitted very candidly that Reagan's
action will, if anything, incite Khadafi
to encourage more terrorist acts.
Similarly, Robert Kupperman of
Georgetown's Center for Strategic
and International Studies has
asserted that "... what we are doing
is guaranteeing a wave of serious ter
rorist acts." And when you think
about it, people who drive truckloads
of explosives into enemy camps with
smiles on their faces (because they
expect to be sent straight to paradise

when they die) are probably not ra
tional utility-maximizing agents who
are impressed by carrot and stick type
arguments. The same sort of juvenile
tit-for-tat attitude that motivates sup
port for Reagan's action has sup
ported decades of bloodshed in places
like Northern Ireland.
I might note, finally, that even the
Mideast editor of the Ron-loving
U.S. News & World Report reported
from Libya that, for Khadafi, "...
the gulf episode seems to have
checked a popularity slide brought
about by austerity measures imposed
because of collapsing oil prices."
It seems that, once again, Reagan
has used a false pretext (this time
"the freedom of the high seas," last
time "saving" medical students) to
engage in a pointless display of mac
hismo, which demonstrates con
clusively the ability of the strongest
nation on earth to beat up on an ill
equipped and poorly trained third
world country. Yes — Khadafi's ter
ritorial claim is absurd. Yes — U.S.
armed forces should fire back when
attacked. But, No — there was no
good reason for being there in the
first place.

Munk's rejection
was right decision
Hats off to Jean Fetter and the rest
of the Undergraduate Admissions
Office. As unfortunate as it may be
for the Cardinal basketball program
that their 6-foot-9 power forward

recruit Chris Munk was denied au
tumn admission to Stanford, it was, as
The Daily's April 1 editorial stated, a
"brave" decision on Fetter's part. Al
though admission to Stanford should
not depend solely on one's past aca
demic performance or future aca
demic potential, a comprehensive
academic evaluation needs to be a
primary determinant during the ap
plication process.
In no way does my support of Fet
ter's decision represent a personal at
tack on Chris Munk's qualifications
as a student athlete; in fact, as a
twice-turned down transfer student
who gave it an extra academic and ex
tracurricular effort before finally
being accepted this winter, I praise
Munk's determined and successful at
tempt to raise his own personal aca
demic standards.
Despite Coach Tom Davis' public
disappointment, by doing the un
popular and applying Stanford's
rigorous admission standards indis
criminately, Dean Fetter has done
what many other big-time university
admissions directors have been
unable to do: place academics above
athletics. For this she deserves
thanks, not criticism.

for the Cardinal basketball program
that their 6-foot-9 power forward

recruit Chris Munk was denied au
tumn admission to Stanford, it was, as
The Daily's April 1 editorial stated, a
"brave" decision on Fetter's part. Al
though admission to Stanford should
not depend solely on one's past aca
demic performance or future aca
demic potential, a comprehensive
academic evaluation needs to be a
primary determinant during the ap
plication process.
In no way does my support of Fet
ter's decision represent a personal at
tack on Chris Munk's qualifications
as a student athlete; in fact, as a
twice-turned down transfer student
who gave it an extra academic and ex
tracurricular effort before finally
being accepted this winter, I praise
Munk's determined and successful at
tempt to raise his own personal aca
demic standards.
Despite Coach Tom Davis' public
disappointment, by doing the un
popular and applying Stanford's
rigorous admission standards indis
criminately, Dean Fetter has done
what many other big-time university
admissions directors have been
unable to do: place academics above
athletics. For this she deserves
thanks, not criticism.
