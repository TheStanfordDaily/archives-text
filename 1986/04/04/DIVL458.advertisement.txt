If \bu Have A Future
In Data Communications. . .
Link Up With ICOT
ICOT is designing the future in data communications,
providing major airlines, banks, and retailers with new
powers of access to information. Located here in Silicon
Valley, we've established our success by combining
hardware and software into integrated data networks. For
engineering graduates, just starting out, we can provide
unique exposure to a full array of the latest data com
munications technology.
And that's just part of the reason that ICOT is a superb
choice for beginning and developing your career. You'll
find our company large enough to provide you with
security and the best resources, but not so large that it
discourages individual contributions. And because we
design custom solutions for our customers, we're con
stantly challenging our technical staff to come through
with fresh ideas.
If you like the sound of a great place to learn, contribute,
and grow, then why not meet us face to face. We're look
ing for people who'll be graduating soon with BS or MS
degrees in EE, ME, and CS. And we'll be at Stanford for
On Campus Interviews

P.O. Box 5143, San Jose. CA 95150-5143. We are an
equal opportunity employer taking affirmative action.
