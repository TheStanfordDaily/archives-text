# Ultraviolet laser slated

I he brightest light in the world now shines at Stanford
University. By 1990, it will be even brighter.
Stanford has begun a project leading to the construction
of the world's brightest source of ultraviolet synchrotron
radiation and laser light.
The project, expected to be fully operational in four
years, will be used for basic research in high-energy
physics and quantum chemistry and for applied research
in medicine.
Stanford is already home to the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), the world's largest facility
of its kind and currently the world's brightest as well. But
because SSRL is a national laboratory, Stanford research
ers do not have unlimited access to "beam time" there.
The University's new project thus marks the first
synchrotron radiation facility here that will be devoted
solely to Stanford research.
"For the first time, we'll have a machine at Stanford
where access is not an issue," said John Madey, research
professor at Stanford's Hansen Laboratories and the
originator of the project. "It should be a substantial at
traction for our on-campus faculty."
Madey said SSRL is also eager to see the facility
become operational because it will ease the demand for
SSRL beam time.
The program has been designed to attract a wide group
of researchers, both faculty members and students, from
various fields. Madey estimates that 60 people are cur
rently involved, but adds that he hopes to attract more un
dergraduates to the project.
Most of the funding — $8.3 million — will come from
the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,
a governmental office that is supporting an increasing
amount of basic research at universities each year. The
total amount of the contract, which is technically between
the University and the Air Force, is $l 1.3 million.
The project will make use of one of the world's most
powerful linear accelerators, the Mark 111, which has been
sitting inactive in the basement of the High Energy
Physics Laboratory for almost 20 years. Thanks to the
Mark 111, a historic scientific installation that led to the
construction of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), the project will not require a new accelerator.
A storage ring will be built adjoining the accelerator at
End Station 3, a vault the size of a football field located 40
feet underground in the center of campus.
The oval ring will be used both to power the laser and to
provide the synchrotron radiation i'or materials science
and medical imaging experiments.
Synchrotron radiation should be available at End Sta
tion 3 by 1988, according to Madey. Once considered a
useless byproduct of accelerator research, the powerful
light source has proven invaluable for industrial and medi
cal research.
Madey says the University will use its synchrotron radi
ation station to study electron photoemission (electron
distribution in various materials). X-ray absorption fine
structure (distance between molecules), microprobe anal
ysis (atomic distribution), and novel imaging techniques.
Synchrotron radiation provides high-resolution capa
bilities for imaging, allowing scientists to view, for exam
ple, the tiny blood vessels known as capillaries.
The project's free electron laser (FEL), which will
produce laser light at either end of the spectrum and
anywhere between, should be operating by 1990, accord
ing to Madey, inventor of the FEL.
The laser light, with greatly enhanced power over the
basic synchrotron radiation light, has several uses. The
long-wave, infrared light has specific applications in bio
chemistry such as laser surgery. The heat of an infrared
laser seals blood vessels so that surgeons can cut without
drawing blood.
The FEL will operate by stripping electrons from
atoms, then firing them through the accelerator, which in
creases the electrons' velocity to nearly the speed of light.
The electron beam passes through a magnetic field, which
causes the particles to "wiggle" and emit radiation.
Part of that radiation is light, which, when repeatedly
reflected by mirrors through the electron beam, becomes
powerful enough to produce a laser pulse.
The strong laser light, tunable to almost any frequency,
is then directed through a port and aimed at a target.
Madey, who has been working with lasers for 20 years,
says it is "time to broaden" his research by studying new

applications. He says he wants to use the new facilities to
make a contribution to society, through inventions, and to
aid the University through continued research training
programs involving students.
The scientists serving as prinicipal investigators for the
Air Force contract are: E. Ingolf Lindau, professor of
electrical engineering: Edward Rubenstein, clinical pro
fessor of medicine at Stanford Medical Center: Helmut
Wiedemann, research professor of applied physics; and
Madey.

Stanford is already home to the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), the world's largest facility
of its kind and currently the world's brightest as well. But
because SSRL is a national laboratory, Stanford research
ers do not have unlimited access to "beam time" there.
The University's new project thus marks the first
synchrotron radiation facility here that will be devoted
solely to Stanford research.
"For the first time, we'll have a machine at Stanford
where access is not an issue," said John Madey, research
professor at Stanford's Hansen Laboratories and the
originator of the project. "It should be a substantial at
traction for our on-campus faculty."
Madey said SSRL is also eager to see the facility
become operational because it will ease the demand for
SSRL beam time.
The program has been designed to attract a wide group
of researchers, both faculty members and students, from
various fields. Madey estimates that 60 people are cur
rently involved, but adds that he hopes to attract more un
dergraduates to the project.
Most of the funding — $8.3 million — will come from
the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,
a governmental office that is supporting an increasing
amount of basic research at universities each year. The
total amount of the contract, which is technically between
the University and the Air Force, is $l 1.3 million.
The project will make use of one of the world's most
powerful linear accelerators, the Mark 111, which has been
sitting inactive in the basement of the High Energy
Physics Laboratory for almost 20 years. Thanks to the
Mark 111, a historic scientific installation that led to the
construction of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), the project will not require a new accelerator.
A storage ring will be built adjoining the accelerator at
End Station 3, a vault the size of a football field located 40
feet underground in the center of campus.
The oval ring will be used both to power the laser and to
provide the synchrotron radiation i'or materials science
and medical imaging experiments.
Synchrotron radiation should be available at End Sta
tion 3 by 1988, according to Madey. Once considered a
useless byproduct of accelerator research, the powerful
light source has proven invaluable for industrial and medi
cal research.
Madey says the University will use its synchrotron radi
ation station to study electron photoemission (electron
distribution in various materials). X-ray absorption fine
structure (distance between molecules), microprobe anal
ysis (atomic distribution), and novel imaging techniques.
Synchrotron radiation provides high-resolution capa
bilities for imaging, allowing scientists to view, for exam
ple, the tiny blood vessels known as capillaries.
The project's free electron laser (FEL), which will
produce laser light at either end of the spectrum and
anywhere between, should be operating by 1990, accord
ing to Madey, inventor of the FEL.
The laser light, with greatly enhanced power over the
basic synchrotron radiation light, has several uses. The
long-wave, infrared light has specific applications in bio
chemistry such as laser surgery. The heat of an infrared
laser seals blood vessels so that surgeons can cut without
drawing blood.
The FEL will operate by stripping electrons from
atoms, then firing them through the accelerator, which in
creases the electrons' velocity to nearly the speed of light.
The electron beam passes through a magnetic field, which
causes the particles to "wiggle" and emit radiation.
Part of that radiation is light, which, when repeatedly
reflected by mirrors through the electron beam, becomes
powerful enough to produce a laser pulse.
The strong laser light, tunable to almost any frequency,
is then directed through a port and aimed at a target.
Madey, who has been working with lasers for 20 years,
says it is "time to broaden" his research by studying new

applications. He says he wants to use the new facilities to
make a contribution to society, through inventions, and to
aid the University through continued research training
programs involving students.
The scientists serving as prinicipal investigators for the
Air Force contract are: E. Ingolf Lindau, professor of
electrical engineering: Edward Rubenstein, clinical pro
fessor of medicine at Stanford Medical Center: Helmut
Wiedemann, research professor of applied physics; and
Madey.
