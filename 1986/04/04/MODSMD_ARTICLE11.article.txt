# Biz prof. pool dwindling

Business schools all over the countr> are having prob
lems finding professors to teach their classes, and the
Stanford Graduate School of Business, considered h\
many to be among the nation's elite, is no exception.
"It's a very simple question of supply and demand."
said Cathy Castillo, spokesperson for the Stanford Busi
ness School Magazine. "There flist aren't that many top
flight faculty out there to be hired."
Statistics bear out Castillo's contention. In 19K5 there
were 2,500 unfilled tenure-track faculty positions in the
nation's business schools. And it appeals that things will
get worse before they get better: In 19K4 there were three
tenure-track openings at U.S. universities for every one
business doctorate awarded.
Stanford GSB Prof. Emeritus George Leland Bach
agrees that there is a scarcity of qualified faculty, but even
more so at a school like Stanford.
"There are very few people like this (qualified for Stan
ford faculty positions) in the United States," he said. "The
world sets them off as very desirable."
The competition among business schools for the
"desirable" faculty members is especially stiff among the
top-ranked business schools: Stanford, Harvard, Mi l",
University of Chicago and Wharton. What happens there,
Castillo said, is that bright, young faculty are frequently
luied away to more prestigious, well-paying jobs.
"It's hard to turn down $150,000 when you earn con
siderably less than that," said Castillo.
But money is only one of the inducements used to at
tract superstar academicians. Endowed chairs, employ
ment for spouses in the new areas of residence — bonuses
such as these are often included in the package deal.

"I think everyone with tenure on our marketing faculty
in recent years has turned clow n an outstanding offer from
a good institution." said Peter Wright. «i professor of mar
keting.
But Stanford has a special problem of its own. in addi
tion to the more universal dilemma of scarcity. The IiSB
doesn't have the "star system."' That is. the school refuses
to pay huge amounts of money to lure away the best and
brightest business school graduates and faculty. The star
system is frequently used bv the more ambitious and
prodigal schools to bolster their up-and-coming programs.
"Stanford doesn't hire bad professors, said Castillo.
"They were all hired with the same high standards in
mind. They're all very good." Since all CiSB professors
are of the same high quality, no one of them deserves a
salary higher than any of his colleagues, she said.
Castillo concedes that this system has been "somew hat
controversial." but maintains that "everyone's been
happy enough" with the status quo. She doesn't see any
reason to change.
"We're not going to compete with (big spenders like)
the University of Texas or the University of Arizona."
Castillo added. "They're Avis. They're the ones w ho have
to try harder. We'll just keep shipping."
In the 1960s and 19705. Dean Ernest Arbuckle and
Dean Emeritus Arjay Miller did in fact shop around for
recruits while building up one of the most prestigious
business schools in the country. Today's administration
hopes to continue that tradition.
"There is no crisis here right now,'' said Bach.
"Stanford is a first-rate school. It's done very well. It has
depth. But that could change in a few years if we lose a
half dozen top people and don't do a good job of replacing
them."
