## An Independent Newspaper Ensure chemical safety

This time we were lucky. On March 20, a violation
of the laws regulating the storage of hazardous chemi
cals in refrigerators led to a minor explosion at the
Stauffer II Physical Chemistry Building. Had the
chemicals been volatile a potentially dangerous explo
sion might have occurred.
And there are refrigerators similar to the one at
Stauffer II in other campus laboratories.
To its credit, the University has taken long strides
toward ensuring safety in campus research centers. For
one thing, the University has installed what Fire Chief
Robert Wall calls "life safety boxes" at many medical
center and chemical laboratories. The boxes contain
lists of the specific hazardous materials present as well
as the names of people familiar with the laboratory to
contact in an emergency. These visible and easily ac
cessible boxes will provide invaluable emergency infor
mation in the event of an accident or chemical spill.
Also, according to Alain Decleve, University direc

tor of Health and Safety, Stanford is taking steps to
facilitate the process of reporting and cleaning up labo
ratory chemical spills.
While the University may be raising the amount of
safety precautions at its laboratories, Stanford's
negligent violation of health and safety laws is inex
cusable. Necessary precautions must be taken immedi
ately.
We strongly encourage the University to do more
than simply comply with the safety laws. Legislation
regarding safety measures tends to concentrate on the
minimum amount of protection required. At a Univer
sity which takes so much pride in the results of its re
search, the minimum is not enough. All expense should
be taken to ensure the safety of researchers and assis
tants in Stanford's laboratories.
We can only hope that the University establishes the
proper level of security before a more serious accident
occurs.
