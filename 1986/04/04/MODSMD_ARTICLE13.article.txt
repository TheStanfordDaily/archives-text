## Viewpoint Greek system is indefensible 
### 
The fraternity system at Stanford should be abolished.
At a university that prides itself on commitment to en
lightenment and equality, the existence of fraternites is in
defensible. Put bluntly, fraternites here are sexist, in
tolerant and anti-intellectual. I feel qualified to make this
categorical statement, having been a member of the Delta
Upsilon house for three years and its president for one.
The following polemic will tar with a wide brush
fraternites at Stanford, with the caveat that most of my ex
amples involve the DU house; however, the actions and
attitudes of any single house are symptomatic of the prob
lems inherent in the idea of fraternities. As our friends at
Residential Education will attest, the DU house is fairly
similar in outlook and behavior to other fraternities.
It has taken a long time for me to write this, a long time
for me to be honest with myself. Throughout my Stanford
career, I defended the fraternity system and worked in my
own house in a vain attempt to reform it. However, the
system in general, and the DU house in specific, are
beyond reform.

The evidence is damning. In just two of the many inci
dents this year, members of the Kappa Alpha house were
arrested for disturbing the peace after a fraternity prank
at the Tonga Room at the Fairmont Hotel in San Fran
cisco, and a student was taken to the hospital with alcohol
poisoning after a Kamikaze party at the Phi Delts. Count
less other, similar actions take place all the time.
While I was a member of the DU house, we as a group
engaged in acts which to anyone else would seem beyond
the pale: wanton destruction of our own and other
people's property, serious drug and alcohol use, theft of
furniture and other property, hazing, drug dealing, sexual
harassment and myriad other violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard and common decency. I am not innocent,
either — and yes, for the most part, I enjoyed myself. 1
was, after all, pledge trainer, then president of the house.
Why, then, decry these actions now? Maybe it is maturity.
Maybe it is a belated awakening of the values my parents
instilled in me, the ability to judge right from wrong.
Maybe it is simply spending time in the "real world,"
where the contradiction between fraternity life and social
responsibility has forced me to choose one or the other.
Some, especially those in my fraternity, may view this
piece as self-righteous or self-serving; it may be those, but
it is also an insider's honest view of fraternities at Stan
ford. It is an attempt to atone for my very real sins. I write
out of sense of frustration. I tried to rein in my fraternity,
but ended up having the same arguments over the same
behavior with the same people week after week. And
these people are causing the same problems in the DU
house still. "They don't learn from the mistakes they
make," observes Stanford Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano about fraternities in general, "let alone the
mistakes other people make." Let us examine my specific
charges:
Sexism. First off, fraternities have houses while
sororities do not (though you will not hear me, in the
name of fairness, arguing very loudly for sororities to be
housed). Fraternities — being all men — are by definition
sexist, but the most emotionally destructive aspect of their
existence is the sexism they foster and bolster in their
members. As one DU asked an incredulous Residential
Education official at a house meeting, "What's wrong
with being sexist if we just do it here in our own house?"
Fraternity life stunts the emotional growth of the frat
member. If these men interacted with women in a living
situation, they would (hopefully) learn that women are
neither Madonnas nor whores, but simply fellow human
beings. Living with women, they would find out quickly
which behavior was acceptable and which disgusted or
alienated their women friends: as it is. men who alienate
women (and other men) through sexist behavior in their
frosh dorms run off to join fraternities, where the unac
ceptable and psychological unhealthy behavior is not
denigrated, but encouraged. After living in the DU house
for three years. I was emotionally maladjusted when 1 en
tered the "real world." Though I struggle with it. I am
sexist, a product of the fraternity mindset which I thought
could coexist harmoniously with my visions of equality.
No such luck.
Intolerance. Fraternity members have a long histoiy of
intolerance toward people of different skin color, socio
economic class. sexual preference and political beliefs. Pe
rennial targets for DU intolerance were the "earth
mamas" of the Columbae cooperative next door, whose
commitment to non-violence was sorely tested by the con
stant barrage of eggs, insults and urine from our frater
nity.
Despite the great strides in societal awareness in the
past 30 years, racism exists largely unmodified in the
minds of many fraternity members today. Ethnic slurs
were common among the jokes that pledges told to the
house at dinner to Uie amusement of the fraternity and the
amazement of some of us: the few blacks in our house
were deeply hurt by this parade of intolerance from their
fraternity brothers. "I am a racist." one particularly en

lightened member of the DU house once told me in trying
to justify his behavior. "You'd be a racist too if you grew
up in Washington, D.C." Too often, this lack of tolerance
is not challenged in the fraternity, but egged on.
Fraternities, despite being clubs of all men, are also
notoriously homophobic. I was horrified to hear members
of my own house cheer when George Segal's "Gay
Liberation" statue was bashed in 1983; other frater
nity "antics" have included dressing up in drag to crash
the annual Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
Valentine's Day Dance.
Anti-intellectual. While individual members of fraterni
ties are often highly ambitious and achievement-oriented,
as a group they scorn those who study and work hard in
school. Having an admonishing letter from the registrar's
office putting one on academic probation was a badge of
honor in our house, a medal to be worn on one's door or
wall. The trick was to party all the time, never go to class
and still get good grades; usually, those few who could get
away with this "educational" lifestyle dragged those not
as gifted down (to the bar) with them. That fraternities
(including the DU house) have produced Rhodes Scholars
in recent years is testimony to the intellectual stamina of
those few high-achieving students who succeeded in spite'
of their surroundings.
What are the arguments for fraternities? Proponents of
the system (including, two years ago, myself) have ad
vanced some of the following;
"You make lifelong friends in fraternities." The Old
Boy or male bonding argument is a standard line. I cer
tainly have great friends from the DU house, but I have
many more who were not in any fraternity. And the 11/12
of the Stanford student body which does not reside in fra
ternities probably thinks it makes lifelong friends in col
lege too.

On the other hand, some of my friends — especially
women — were loath to come by my fraternity to visit me,
for fear of being verbally or physically abused by my
••friends." To some people — those who rightly saw fra
ternities not as social centers but as social anachronisms
— I was ashamed to admit where I lived.
"If fraternities are abolished, you'll be limiting our
freedom of choice." This appeal to our basic American
values overlooks the fact that "freedom of choice" does
not exist for those seeking to join the frat — they instead
have the dubious freedom to be chosen. And that no
freedom of choice exists for women who might want
access to the prime housing many fraternities now occupy.
"They're just boys. Everybody should have a chance -
and a place - to be silly and immature. You did. " It is cer
tainly true that I was silly and immature. As we all should
be from time to time. But too often, the ••silliness" frater
nities try to justify is far more serious: "silliness" should
not he broadened to include sexual violence, drug and al
cohol abuse or destruction of property.
"If fraternities are abolished, there will be no social life
on campus." The intellectual poverty of this argument
reflects the imagination and ingenuity of its proponents.
How much more evidence has to amass before people
realize the intellectual and emotional — not to mention fi
nancial — cost of the fraternity system? Residential Edu
cation has listv of fraternity incidents pages long for
anybody interested in further research. Learn from your
mistakes. Stanford, and get rid of fraternities before they
do any more damage. As Pisano remarks, "collectively
they (fraternities) have lost touch with the reality that is
Stanford." And. in maintaining and subsidizing these fra
ternities. Stanford has lost touch with the fact that it is a
university dedicated to equality and intellectual pursuit.
