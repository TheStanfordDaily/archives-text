# Reconsider Palestinian case
## 
### 
In my last column ("Palestinians need nation," Feb.
28), I raised the possibility that the breakdown of the pre
liminary Middle East peace talks was not, in fact, entirely
the fault of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yas
ser Arafat, but that the blame lay largely with the United
States, Israel and Jordan. Isaac Winer, in his viewpoint
("PLO violence intolerable," Daily, March 5) took
serious umbrage at this notion.
I am responding to him in my column because I believe
that his ideas are widely shared, and that these ideas need
to be challenged.
Winer argued that Israel is a valuable strategic ally of
the United States; that U.S. peace initiatives in the region
should reflect this vital interest; that Israeli terrorism,
unlike Palestinian terrorism, is always legitimate military
action; and that Israel has made great sacrifices for the
sake of peace.

He also argued that no progress on peace can be made
until the PLO endorses U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338;
that it is ludicrous for Arafat not to endorse them when
his people stand so much to gain if he does; and — putting
aside all this peace process stuff for a minute — after all,
why do the Palestinians insist on having their own state
anyway? Why cant they consider Jordan their state? And
why should Israel give up any territory when she has so
little and the Arabs have so much?
I will not refute the fact that the United States does,
indeed, see Israel as a vital strategic ally. Yet this percep
tion doesn't have to mean that the United States can't
pursue a solution to the Palestinian question that includes
national self-determination.
Let us indulge, for a moment, in a wild flight of fancy
and imagine that the United States were to sponsor
negotiations that included provisions for a Palestinian
state. Agreements emerging from these talks would un
doubtedly impose heavy restrictions on the organization
of Palestinian armed forces, and multinational forces
could insure secure borders as they did in the Sinai after
the Camp David accords were signed.
Israel doesn't steadfastly reject Palestinian demands for
a state because she feels militarily threatened, but rather
because of a visceral fear of what that state would mean; if
Israel allows a state to form, she will be tacitly admitting
that Palestinian nationalism is legitimate, an admission
that would fundamentally counterpose the basis of Israel's
own legitimacy.
One can hardly blame the Israelis for feeling this way,
but the fact remains that the Palestinians are a people
without a homeland, and they obviously aren't planning to
give up the fight anytime soon. If Israel wants peace with
the Palestinians, she'll have to grant them a state.
But does Israel want peace? Not really. Israel wants se
curity — not an absence of war. She feels she can secure
her borders more effectively through military domination
than through diplomatic accommodation.

Winer claimed that Israel made a sacrifice for peace by
returning the Sinai. Former President Jimmy Carter sees
it differently — he feels that his efforts toward a compre
hensive Middle East peace settlement were thwarted by
then Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who sought
to militarily neutralize Egypt while keeping Israel free to
attack the PLO in Lebanon. There was a second
framework to the accords that never got anywhere: the
"Framework for Peace in the Middle East." In one provi
sion it called for the autonomy of the inhabitants of the
West Bank and Gaza, but the framework fell through
when Begin announced that after five years Israel would
annex those territories.
Israel is often portrayed as the peaceful victim of Arab
terrorism. What about the systematic harassment of
Arabs in the occupied territories? They are beaten, shot at
and jailed without trial. What about Israeli action in South
Lebanon? To give just one example, in 1982 an anti-PLO
group headed by Abu Nidal (who has been condemned to
death by the PLO) failed in an attempt to assassinate the
Israeli ambassador in London. In retaliation, Israel then
bombed Palestinian and Lebanese targets in Lebanon
(where, incidentally, the Nidal group has no office). Over
200 civilians were killed. This is hardly what one would
call seeking out terrorists and regrettably but unavoidably
killing a few civilians along the way.
There are dozens of similar incidents that have been
consistently ignored by the U.S. media. However, in the
Hebrew newspaper Ha'aretz, the noted Israeli military
analyst Ze'ev Schiff gave an explanation of Israeli strat
egy: "In South Lebanon we struck the civilian population
because they deserved it .. . the Israeli Army has always
struck civilian populations, purposely and consciously
.... even when Israeli settlements had not been struck."
Winer suggested that the Palestinians endorse the
United Nations resolutions unconditionally, and "put the
ball in the court of the United States and Israel." The
Palestinians would regard this as a sick joke — after all
those are the two countries that have consistently
frustrated Palestinian goals for a state. An unconditional
endorsement won't get the Palestinians what they want; it
will instead be a step toward some kind of joint
Jordanian-Palestinian condominium over the territories, a
far cry from self-determination.
Winer is grasping at straws to suggest that some other
Middle Eastern state should give up territory for the
Palestinians. That's a ridiculous suggestion — it's like
saying that if Italy invades Spain, that Spaniards should, in
the interests of peace, live in France instead of fight for
their country. After all, everyone's European over there.
What is most important to question, I think, is the
skewed perspective from which the United States looks at
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. We forget what happened
in 1948: Palestine was taken away by U.N. decree and by
military conquest. We consistently reject that the Pales
tinians have a right to their land. We are shocked and hor
rified by Palestinian terrorism; while it's horrible, it
should come as no shock — it's a response of a deter
mined, yet militarily weak people to recover part of what
was its own country. If we want to put a stop to terrorism
we must consider its source, instead of continuing to sanc
tion an ineffectual battle against the Palestinian people.
