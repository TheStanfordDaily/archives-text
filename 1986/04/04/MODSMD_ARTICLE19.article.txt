## Can you read between the lines? 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
As this first week of a new quarter
draws to a close, let us pause for a
moment to reflect on all the good
things the spring trimester brings us
in its resealable Glad Bag of happi
ness. Take, for instance, lines.
You were expecting I should effuse
about windsurfer's high or the many
ultraviolet opportunities for that pre
skin-cancerous glow otherwise
known as the perfect tan, maybe?
Pull your head out of the lime Jell-O
and think about where you've spent
most of your time the last few days,
buckaroo. You were standing in a line
somewhere, right?
Just how many trips have you made
to the second floor of the Bookstore,
huh? Can you even count them?
First, there's the line where some nice
old lady in a red smock checks your
check for bounce, baptizes it with
some red ink and sends you on to the
second line, where you get to pay
your money now and hope for rebates
in a later life.
Outside, there's another line for
you if you enjoyed the first two. The
guys behind the backpack table prob
ably know what color your Caribou
Mountaineer is before you tell them,
don't they?
And that nice little patio beside
Old Union. You'll always associate it

with getting grades from last quarter,
won't you?
But if you think you're having fun
now, just try going a day without
standing in line for something.

You won't eat much. There'll be no
fro yo, no Big Mac, no munchies from
the Store, no familiar bink of the
meal card machine. You won't have
to carry any packages larger than
your P.O. box, and if you run out of
spending money, don't try to make a
plastic offering to the all-knowing
ATM. You'll just have to wait in
more lines to buy stuff with the Andy

Jacksons it gives you anyway.
And don't try to tell me you've
never been wait-listed for a class
before, either. If you have, your I.D.
number was painlessly holding your
place in a paper variation on the clas
sic line theme. If not, what have you
been doing, changing your name
every quarter so you could register
before everyone else?
As a self-appointed chronicler of
student pastimes, I feel it is my duty
to expound today on the virtues of
waiting in such lines, the deep social
impact of it, the civilizing influence,
the almost meditational boredom.
You don't appreciate lines? Re
member the Mondale rally last year?
I know / had at least three separate
umbrella tines dripping fresh rain
water on that vulnerable spot right
behind the left ear.
When I finally decided to let
Mondale uphold democracy without
me, I realized that my feet no longer
connected with the ground. As the
crowd had compacted, I had
levitated, until I was held above the
puddles by the elbows of my
anonymous neighbors. So much for
making it to my 1:15, but that's
democracy in action.
I've always found it interesting that
the word for crowd in French is
"foule," pronounced like the English
word, "fool."
Lines may not be as exciting as

used dental floss or even the Califor
nia lottery TV game show, but if it
weren't for lines, the old Maples
Pavilion system of registration would
have resembled a slam dancing con
vention minus the hair gel.
Reg Day at Maples â€” the good old
days. You knew you were in a large,
uncaring bureaucracy then. But the
lines in Maples also served a social
purpose.
Somehow they rigged it so that you
always ran into someone from your
freshman dorm you'd been meaning
to visit for the past two quarters.
After that awkward interval when
both of you wonder whether you re
member each others' names, you
could usually have a meaningful rally
of small talk salvos before furbling off
to opposite free throw lines.
(To furble is actually a verb. It's
that type of seemingly short line they
have at Disneyland that winds back
and forth 23 times before you get to
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. That's just the
general meaning, of course.)
You probably didn't even realize
how much you hated lines until 1
brought this all up, which just shows
how effective our linear programming
is.
The only consolation 1 can offer is
that sooner or later you can probably
escape to Lake Lag, if the lines for
beach space aren't too long.
