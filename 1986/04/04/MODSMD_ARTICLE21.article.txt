Rolling Stones — « Dirty Work" 13 17
19
You buy the album. You look at
the cover. They look old. That's all
right, you think. You laugh when you
see the completely whacked-out car
toon art on the inner sleeve. You find
that Keith and Mick still stuck to
gether and wrote almost all the songs
despite rumors that Mick was merely
a guest vocalist on a Keith Richards
album. You smile — this is gonna be
good, you think.
You put the album on. You wonder
why it sounds like Heart's doing the
music. You wonder why Mick is yel

ling like a pig with a wet handkerchief
in his throat. You wonder why (with
the exception of "Sleep Tonight") the
best songs on the alhum, "Harlem
Shuffle" and "Too Rude," are not
written by the Glimmer Twins. You
wonder why Keith actually has a bet
ter voice than Mick.

You wish you didn't have such high
expectations for the Stones so that
you could do a good review. You start
thinking that "Undercover" was
really a pretty awesome album. You
slap yourself. The classic Stones riffs
are there but have become trivial —
as they're slashed through yet again,
they sound like a parody of the
original sound. In the end, "Dirty
Work"' only makes you wish the Roll
ing Stones would quit while they're
still considered the geniuses who put
soul into rock n' roll.
Van Halen —"5150" 23 14.5
However painful it is to agree with
a great guy like David Lee Roth, the
dude definitely contributed more
than just vocals n' acrobatics to VH's
somewhat heavy metal. Diamond

Dave also brought humor, sparkle
and personality to Eddie Van Halen's
constant stream of 64th notes.
Hearing new singer Sammy Hagar
(sans les acrobatiques) makes us
realize that hard-rock lead vocalists
(even VH's) are a dime a dozen.
Hagar can shout your standard yeah-
I'm-drunk-let's-do-it-and-go-to-a
wi Id-party-baby-yeah-all-right
choruses its well as your roommate
does. And let's face it. Dave did the
same thing. He just did it differently
— jokingly — like even he couldn't
believe how dumb he sounded. Well.
Hagar can believe it, and it doesn't
sound like the rest of the band even
cares. What it does sound like is every
other rock band around, with a
couple of Eddie's "Beat It" guitar
solos mixed in.
There are no good songs, there are

no good moments, there are no good
vocals. These guys are obviously glad
that they got rid of that awful Roth
boy who didn't wanna rock. If you're
the kind of person who looks lon
gingly back to those good ol' high
school days of faded bell-bottoms,
black T-shirts and pentagrams, take a

trip hack to mediocrity with "5150."
Otherwise, cut your hair, get a job,
have Daddy buy you a BMW and lis
ten to Seritti Politti.
Cocteau Twins —"Treasure" 31 37
41 43
If you can get into progressive or
experimental music, you can get into
the Cocteau Twins' latest and most
accessible album — no problem.
Well, maybe. Though the album has
no credits, it is believed that the band
has two women — one the guitarist,
the other the vocalist — and a man on
bass. The drummer is a drum ma
chine (gender indeterminate).
You won't find a lyric sheet, be
cause there are few words on this al


bum that when put together in a se
ries make sense or were even meant
to. The vocalist sings in what is almost
her own personal language, one that
is remarkably effective in bringing
across the band's distinctive sound.
That sound is constructed around
the lead vocalist's strong and tremen
dously versatile voice, which betrays
an obvious Eastern influence. She
uses a lot of halftones and trills, both
common to Indian music. This

woman has the power and range of
Annie Lennox, but she comes across
as much less piercing. She's more of
an instrument for the band than any
thing else.
Surrounding the vocals are
echoing, ringing guitars and a con
stantly driving beat. The layers of
sound are atmospheric, but never
overwhelming. The result is a set of
very melodic, sometimes choral,
sometimes danceable songs. Good
stuff.
