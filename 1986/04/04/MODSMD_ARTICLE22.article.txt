# 'Smooth Talk' takes liberties with Oates
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"Smooth Talk," the movie adapta
tion of Joyce Carol Oates' short story
"Where ire You Going, Where Have
You Been?," is set in the sunny,
adolescent summer of sixteen-year
old Connie (Laura Dern). In both
story and movie Connie is a tall,
lanky, sensuous girl whose head is
filled with "trashy daydreams" of
boys, music, friends, days at the mall
and days on the beach. Director
Joyce Chopra and screenwriter Tom

Cole have a feel for the funny, laid
back rhythms of girls out for a good
time; they "scope" the guys and get
turned on, but are not too serious
about "making it" with anyone.
The atmosphere in the first two
thirds of "Smooth Talk" has some of
the loose, funky ripeness of parts of
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"
particularly when the trio of young
actresses ( Dern, Margaret Welsh and
Sarah Inglis) play girlfriends out on
the town together. But these scenes
are only part of the movie — that is,
the most successful part is the part

that has the least to do with Oates'
stoiy.
There's an almost formal split be
tween the scenes of the girls together
and the scenes of Connie at home,
where she has to put up with her nag
ging, pestering mother (Mary Kay
Place), her drippy sister (Elizabeth
Berridge) and pleasantly spaced-out
dad (a rather too spaced-out Levon
Helm).
Chopra and Cole's confidence falls
apart in the home scenes, which are
very poorly staged. Place suffers the
most; in scenes where she has to

berate Connie for her teenaged
stupor, Place's voice sounds tinny and
screechy, as if she were projecting
into a high school auditorium. Ber
ridge seems too young for her role as
Connie's sister, who's supposed to be
several years older than Connie; her
relationship with Connie in the movie
is vague and undefined, though in the
story she's meant to be jealous of
Connie's success with the boys. (So,
in a more unusual way, is Connie's
mother, though that aspect is com
pletely lost in the movie.)
For the first two-thirds of the

movie, Chopra and Cole aim for a
naturalistic narrative about one girl's
coming-of-age summer, and they
mostly succeed. But a second formal
split occurs in the last half hour that's
downright schizophrenic: a weird,
psycho-sexual James Dean type
named Arnold Friend (Treat Wil
liams) drives out to Connie's place
one afternoon when she's home alone
and plays an elaborate, threatening
dating game with her. He cozies up to
her young sexuality in a very direct
and disturbing way. He claims to be
her lover, knows about her family and

friends, and promises to take her
away from her father's house and
former life.
Oates developed this character
from reports in the early '60s in
Arizona of a man in his 30s who
was hanging out with a teenage
crowd, seducing the high-school girls
and murdering some of them. The
shocker was that those he didn't kill
kept his secrets and refused to turn
him in. Oates' tale is sordid, queasy
trap of a story, and it's very effective.
She wrote dialogue for Friend that
suggests why young girls might have
responded to his real-life counterpart
as they did: he's very knowing, very
personal and rhythmically seductive
in the way that might mesmerize a girl
like Connie (who always seems to be
swaying to an internalized pop
melody).
The ending of the story has Connie
going off with Friend (who threatens
to harm her family if she doesn't),
and Oates leaves us hanging with a
lyrical final sentence that's in
macabre counterpoint to the grim cir
cumstances. The completely different

ending of the movie is, I think, a flat
out mistake, and sounds an optimistic
note that's at odds with Oates' story.
The filmmakers reverse Oates'
meanings: Friend is turned into a life
affirming, reconciling force — every
girl should meet such a guy — which
is simply weird, given what we've
seen and heard.
Chopra and Cole's bizarre conclu
sion may have been influenced by
something so simple as the tone of the
times; we're back in the era of happy
Hollywood endings, and family
reconciliation scenes are de rigueur
(witness "Twice in a Lifetime" and
"Terms of Endearment"). Somehow,
it's disturbing when even indepen
dent films abandon sense, perspective
and narrative logic and start following
these trends.
