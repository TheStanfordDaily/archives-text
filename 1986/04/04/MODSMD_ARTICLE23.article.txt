# After first hour, 'F/X' fizzles out
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"F/X" has a nifty life-imitates-art
premise, and for the first half-hour
the movie has all the earmarks of an
clever and involving thriller.
Rollie Tyler (Bryan Brown), a spe
cial effects man currently blowing
people apart for a gangster film, is ap
proached by a shady government
agent (Cliff DeYoung) and asked to
stage the fake assassination of an ex
mobster chieftain (Jerry Orbach).
The agent works for a branch of the
Justice Department involved in the
Witness Relocation Program, which
needs to protect the mob boss from
former associates while he fingers
them for the government.
Rollie is reluctant, but eventually
agrees, and also agrees to do the gun
ning down (in a crowded restaurant)
himself. True to the spirit of the
movie's title ("F/X" is movie jargon
for "special effects"), everything is
not what it seems, and after the com
pleting job Rollie finds himself
hounded by his government
employers and a gaggle of hired kil
lers. To save himself, he turns to the
tricks of his trade and goes after his
pursuers.
"F/X" keeps us disoriented and
guessing for the first hour or so, but
the plot turns out to much less com

plicated than we're initially led to
believe; the potential triple- and
quadruple-crosses resolve themselves
into a rather mundane and unsatisfy

ing double-cross. Having nothing bet
ter to do for the middle third, the
filmmakers put Rcllie (and a couple
of associates) on the all-too-familiar

action treadmill that includes a
gratuitous car chase, a gratuitous
death (Rollie's girlfriend, played by
Diane Verona — the most appealing
character on the screen), and a
renegade cop (played with energizing
relish by Brian Dennehy).
The movie is entertaining in a lim
ited way, but the schemes are on par
with a weak "Mission: Impossible"
episode, and it gets more pointless as
it goes along. Director Robert Man
del does a workmanlike job, and the
director of photography, Miroslav
Ondricek, films luscious nightscapes,
but the Robert T. Megginson and
Gregory Fleeman script doesn't do
much for the characters. (Dennehy's
cop is so grating and combative I
couldn't believe for a minute he'd ac
tually attain rank within the police
force.)
Bryan Brown is a very engaging,
big and lanky actor; he's good
looking, but not afraid to appear des
perate or silly. In a few scenes he's
saddled with Martha Gehman
(Rollie's assistant) in one of the most
hopeless performances yet this year.
There are no other embarrassments
in the cast, though, and the characters
keep jumping along; their chief func
tion is to move the plot forward, and
they mostly succeed. By its nature, a
movie like "F/X" needs all the plot
momentum it can get.
