Touch of Evil (1958)
York Theatre, San Francisco
Nearly two decades after "Citizen
Kane," Orson Welles made this
breathtaking baroque thriller based
on a Whit Masterson novel. He and
his photographer, Russell Metty,
shot the film in Venice (California),
but it seems to have been made in
hell, and no one who has seen it can
drive through Venice without think
ing that he is in hell. The peculiarly
effective cast includes Welles him
self, Marlene Dietrich, Charlton
Heston, Akim Tamiroff, Joseph

Cotten, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mercedes
McCambridge and Janet Leigh, who
has an extremely unpleasant pre
" Psycho" encounter in a motel.
Plays Monday with "Night and the
City." %
Back to the Future (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Robert Zemeckis (director and
co-writer) and Bob Gale (co-writer
and producer) team up again for the
first time since their terrific "Used
Cars" (1980), and though their ma
terial here has less vulgar energy and
bite, it still has their unflagging inno
vation in setting up gags. This time
travel fantasy satirically

cross-references the consumer
cultures of the '50s and '80s. hut it's
mostly about the Oedipal com
plexities of teen-aged Marty McFly
(Michael J. Fox), who goes hack in
time and meets his teen-aged par
ents. Typically for Zemeckis and
Gale, the comic structure is incredi
bly intricate, with jokes that set up
reverberations throughout the
movie: you have to pay attention to
catch everything. There are some
very funny performances, notably by
Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Crispin
Glover, who does some undefinably
hilarious things as Marty's dad. With
Lea Thompson.
Plays Sunday.
Paris, Texas (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The Sam Shepard trademarks are
clearly visible all the way through

the movie, like signposts, but this
isn't really a Shepard film: it's more
like Shepard dubbed into a foreign
language. L. M. Kit Carson
"adapted"' Shepard's script. Wim
Wenders directed it, and in the
process it's been turned into a sort of
Teutonic "Kramer vs. Kramer."
Watching this movie, with the
deliberate flatness of the semi
improvised acting, the measured
pace, the dead spots up on the
screen, is a weird, alienating experi
ence, and it surprises you that it
amounts to so little by the end. It
looks terrific: Robby Muller has shot
it in a clean, elegant style, with a
genuine feeling for the loneliness of
the western U.S. landscape. And it
has a haunting score by that
wunderkind, Ry Cooder. It's not a
dislikable movie in any way; in fact,
once you get accustomed to the
peculiar tempo, some of it is actually
funny (though it's like hearing jokes
in another language — you have to
translate them before you laugh).
With Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja
Kinski, Hunter Carson, Dean Stock
well and Aurore Clement.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Signal 7."
Alexander Nevsky (1938)
La Pena Cultural Center, Berkeley
It isn't easy to sort out one's reac
tions to this famous Sergei
Eisenstein epic, set in medieval Rus
sia (where the adversaries are invad
ing German knights): the imagery is
often phenomenal, Prokofiev's
music is magnificent, the ice battle is
one of the great war sequences in
movies, and yet a lot of the movie is
unbelievably boring. Eisenstein cer
tainly created parts of a masterpiece.
Plays Wednesday.

Prizzi's Honor (1985)
Aquarius Theatre. Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses and
triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic arias. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception: the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age. but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two main
characters — hitpersons Charley
Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and Irene
Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense: it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey as
Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Huston's daughter
Anjelica is the delightfully wicked
little hellcat Maerose (she's Char
ley's former fiancee, and she's out to
get him). With Robert Loggia and
John Randolph.
Plays this week with "Smooth
Talk."
Cabaret (1972)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Bob Fosse directed this altogether
amazing musical, set in Berlin in
1931. Inspired by the kabarett-form
satirical musicals of Kurt Weill and
Bertolt Brecht, Fosse uses the num

hers performed b\ Liza Minnelli and
Joel Grey at the Kit Kat klub to
comment on the political and social
milieu and on the character of Sally
Bowles, the desperately life
embracing. ultimately self
destructive gamine Minnelli plays.
Musicals don't come much better
than this one. which is stunningly di
rected. shot (by Geoffrey Un
sworth). choreographed (by Fosse,
of course), scored (by John Kander
and Fred Ebb) and designed.
Plays Sunday with "Funny Girl."
Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)
Bijou. Palo Alto
Woody Allen's latest is a return to
the style and substance of his
modern comedies of the late '70s.
Now. in the 80s. Allen seems to be
more relaxed, more at ease with
himself than ever before. He juggles
his large cast with considerable skill,
and many of the performers —
notably Michael Caine and Dianne
Wiest — are wonderful. It's a very
accomplished movie, but it doesn't
quite live up to its aspirations of nar
rative scope; it's diffuse, and ulti
mately weightless. And though
Allen seems confident and secure in
his return to this style of comedy,
tedious, self-justifying platitudes lie
just beneath the surface: they're ex
pressed by Mickey (played by Allen
himself), a neurotic hypochondriac
who has a life-affirming experience
in a movie house while watching
"Duck Soup." With Mia Farrow
(who is, as always, terrific, though
she would do better by Allen if he
would stop trying to ennoble her),
Barbra Hershey, Max von Sydow.
Lloyd Nolan, Maureen O'Sullivan,
Carrie Fisher and others.
Plays this week.

peculiar tempo, some of it is actually
funny (though it's like hearing jokes
in another language — you have to
translate them before you laugh).
With Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja
Kinski, Hunter Carson, Dean Stock
well and Aurore Clement.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Signal 7."
Alexander Nevsky (1938)
La Pena Cultural Center, Berkeley
It isn't easy to sort out one's reac
tions to this famous Sergei
Eisenstein epic, set in medieval Rus
sia (where the adversaries are invad
ing German knights): the imagery is
often phenomenal, Prokofiev's
music is magnificent, the ice battle is
one of the great war sequences in
movies, and yet a lot of the movie is
unbelievably boring. Eisenstein cer
tainly created parts of a masterpiece.
Plays Wednesday.

Prizzi's Honor (1985)
Aquarius Theatre. Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses and
triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic arias. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception: the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age. but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two main
characters — hitpersons Charley
Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and Irene
Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense: it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey as
Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Huston's daughter
Anjelica is the delightfully wicked
little hellcat Maerose (she's Char
ley's former fiancee, and she's out to
get him). With Robert Loggia and
John Randolph.
Plays this week with "Smooth
Talk."
Cabaret (1972)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Bob Fosse directed this altogether
amazing musical, set in Berlin in
1931. Inspired by the kabarett-form
satirical musicals of Kurt Weill and
Bertolt Brecht, Fosse uses the num

hers performed b\ Liza Minnelli and
Joel Grey at the Kit Kat klub to
comment on the political and social
milieu and on the character of Sally
Bowles, the desperately life
embracing. ultimately self
destructive gamine Minnelli plays.
Musicals don't come much better
than this one. which is stunningly di
rected. shot (by Geoffrey Un
sworth). choreographed (by Fosse,
of course), scored (by John Kander
and Fred Ebb) and designed.
Plays Sunday with "Funny Girl."
Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)
Bijou. Palo Alto
Woody Allen's latest is a return to
the style and substance of his
modern comedies of the late '70s.
Now. in the 80s. Allen seems to be
more relaxed, more at ease with
himself than ever before. He juggles
his large cast with considerable skill,
and many of the performers —
notably Michael Caine and Dianne
Wiest — are wonderful. It's a very
accomplished movie, but it doesn't
quite live up to its aspirations of nar
rative scope; it's diffuse, and ulti
mately weightless. And though
Allen seems confident and secure in
his return to this style of comedy,
tedious, self-justifying platitudes lie
just beneath the surface: they're ex
pressed by Mickey (played by Allen
himself), a neurotic hypochondriac
who has a life-affirming experience
in a movie house while watching
"Duck Soup." With Mia Farrow
(who is, as always, terrific, though
she would do better by Allen if he
would stop trying to ennoble her),
Barbra Hershey, Max von Sydow.
Lloyd Nolan, Maureen O'Sullivan,
Carrie Fisher and others.
Plays this week.

Touch of Evil (1958)
York Theatre, San Francisco
Nearly two decades after "Citizen
Kane," Orson Welles made this
breathtaking baroque thriller based
on a Whit Masterson novel. He and
his photographer, Russell Metty,
shot the film in Venice (California),
but it seems to have been made in
hell, and no one who has seen it can
drive through Venice without think
ing that he is in hell. The peculiarly
effective cast includes Welles him
self, Marlene Dietrich, Charlton
Heston, Akim Tamiroff, Joseph

Cotten, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mercedes
McCambridge and Janet Leigh, who
has an extremely unpleasant pre
" Psycho" encounter in a motel.
Plays Monday with "Night and the
City." %
Back to the Future (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Robert Zemeckis (director and
co-writer) and Bob Gale (co-writer
and producer) team up again for the
first time since their terrific "Used
Cars" (1980), and though their ma
terial here has less vulgar energy and
bite, it still has their unflagging inno
vation in setting up gags. This time
travel fantasy satirically

cross-references the consumer
cultures of the '50s and '80s. hut it's
mostly about the Oedipal com
plexities of teen-aged Marty McFly
(Michael J. Fox), who goes hack in
time and meets his teen-aged par
ents. Typically for Zemeckis and
Gale, the comic structure is incredi
bly intricate, with jokes that set up
reverberations throughout the
movie: you have to pay attention to
catch everything. There are some
very funny performances, notably by
Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Crispin
Glover, who does some undefinably
hilarious things as Marty's dad. With
Lea Thompson.
Plays Sunday.
Paris, Texas (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The Sam Shepard trademarks are
clearly visible all the way through

the movie, like signposts, but this
isn't really a Shepard film: it's more
like Shepard dubbed into a foreign
language. L. M. Kit Carson
"adapted"' Shepard's script. Wim
Wenders directed it, and in the
process it's been turned into a sort of
Teutonic "Kramer vs. Kramer."
Watching this movie, with the
deliberate flatness of the semi
improvised acting, the measured
pace, the dead spots up on the
screen, is a weird, alienating experi
ence, and it surprises you that it
amounts to so little by the end. It
looks terrific: Robby Muller has shot
it in a clean, elegant style, with a
genuine feeling for the loneliness of
the western U.S. landscape. And it
has a haunting score by that
wunderkind, Ry Cooder. It's not a
dislikable movie in any way; in fact,
once you get accustomed to the
peculiar tempo, some of it is actually
funny (though it's like hearing jokes
in another language — you have to
translate them before you laugh).
