# Diversions
## 'Window' gives great view 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN 
Perched high above the churning Pacific
Ocean on a slope of the rugged San Lucia
Coastal Mountains is the hotel Ventana —
"window" in Spanish. It is from this picture
perfect window that 60 fortunate guests can
enjoy one of the ultimate Big Sur experi
ences. Ventana is a hotel like no other.
This spectacular wooded retreat is most
famous for what it lacks. There are no tennis
courts here, no golf carts buzzing around, no
conventions, no screaming children. What
does Ventana offer? A place to con
template. to recharge one's spirit in the
awesome beauty of one of nature's true
wonders.
The architecture of Ventana is special.
The natural redwood and cedar buildings
seem to mesh into the mountainside and
become almost invisible. Each room has a
private porch overlooking either the rugged
mountains, the sea far below, or both. The
original 24-unit Inn and Restaurant opened
in 1975. Since that time, 16 additional units
have been added. Open space, peace and
quiet are all cherished here.
We arrived during one of those driving
rainstorms which can only occur near the
coast. The sea did its best to scare us off with
its frothing power as we drove along the
cliff-hanging coastal Route I. Just when we
thought we would be forever lost in the
storm, we found Ventana. A mere 28 miles
south of the last stoplight on Route 1 the
world ends and begins again.
Our arrival must have been quite a sight
as, drenched to the skin, we ran from the
parking lot into the reception lobby. The
staff came out of the back office in full force
to welcome us. A long-awaited cup of hot
coffee was offered and accepted. After the
usual check-in ritual, a brave bellman took
us back into the storm and to our room.

The rooms were among the most beautiful
I have ever seen: they were designed for
pure relaxation. It was almost too perfect —
the natural wood and pastel colors blending
with the mountain terrain. A canopied bed
adjacent to a roaring fireplace, a large bay
window from which to watch the storm in
warmth and peace with only the sounds of
the fireplace, the rain and an occasional bolt
of thunder.
After drying off we decided to once again
brave the storm and make our way to the
dining room. Rather than drive, we opted to
walk along the lighted path through the for
est. The sounds of the storm were haunting
as we dashed along the path. The Ventana
Restaurant fits in perfectly with the rest of
this resort. Again, natural woods and wicker
combine man-made architecture with natu
ral surroundings. The food is fresh and ex
cellent, although not for the budget-minded.
The extensive wine list is superb.
Visitors to Ventana must understand that
they are away from civilization. Electricity
only came to this region in 1951. The res
taurant's shortage of Romaine lettuce to
make the Caesar salad 1 ordered was only
part of the price one pays for getting away
from it all. The guest rooms all have televi
sions discreetly hidden away in cedar
cabinets, but TV reception is spotty at best.
During our stay only one channel came in —
sort of. (The Inn does broadcast video
movies three times each day for those who
can't live without the tube.)
After a wonderful dinner, we made our
way back to our room. The restaurant staff,
seeing that we were less than enthusiastic
about running through the storm back to our
room, called the security patrol to drive us
home. By the time we reached our room, the
storm had let up significantly. The wind con
tinued its howling, but the driving rain was

slowly turning into a deep coastal fog.
We decided to explore the Japanese spas
and saunas as they were a fairly short walk
from our room. Both the baths and saunas
are cleverly designed to permit either single
sex or coed bathing under the stars, yet
protected from the wind. They are officially
open until 2 a.m., but nobody seemed to
mind if guests stayed later, as long as they
were quiet. In fitting with Ventana's natural
ambiance, clothing is optional in the spas
and saunas.
Above the pool there is a clothing
optional redwood sundeck. To help guests
loosen tight muscles, a professional massage
service is available. The guest rooms also
come stocked with a small bottle of body oil
for those who prefer to indulge in a private
massage session.
As morning broke over Ventana, the sun
managed to fight its way through the thick
fog. The deep green of the mountains, the
rich blue of sky and sea all seemed to come
alive. Complimentary breakfast is served in
the reception lobby before a roaring fire, or
guests may eat on the open air deck. A
simple phone call can get your breakfast
promptly delivered to your room.
After breakfast, spend some time sunning
in one of the hammocks, lounging by the
pool or spa, or walking down to the ocean to
explore the wonders that Big Sur has to of
fer. Visitors to this special retreat come to
get away from everyone except themselves.
Ventana is an ideal place for lovers, es
capists or anyone who simply wants to enjoy
nature at its best.
Room rates range from $ 125-5525 per
night. A few suites are available with
kitchenettes and private hot tubs. For
reservations or information call (408) 667-
2331 or I -800-628-6500 toll free in Califor
nia.

Perched high above the churning Pacific
Ocean on a slope of the rugged San Lucia
Coastal Mountains is the hotel Ventana —
"window" in Spanish. It is from this picture
perfect window that 60 fortunate guests can
enjoy one of the ultimate Big Sur experi
ences. Ventana is a hotel like no other.
This spectacular wooded retreat is most
famous for what it lacks. There are no tennis
courts here, no golf carts buzzing around, no
conventions, no screaming children. What
does Ventana offer? A place to con
template. to recharge one's spirit in the
awesome beauty of one of nature's true
wonders.
The architecture of Ventana is special.
The natural redwood and cedar buildings
seem to mesh into the mountainside and
become almost invisible. Each room has a
private porch overlooking either the rugged
mountains, the sea far below, or both. The
original 24-unit Inn and Restaurant opened
in 1975. Since that time, 16 additional units
have been added. Open space, peace and
quiet are all cherished here.
We arrived during one of those driving
rainstorms which can only occur near the
coast. The sea did its best to scare us off with
its frothing power as we drove along the
cliff-hanging coastal Route I. Just when we
thought we would be forever lost in the
storm, we found Ventana. A mere 28 miles
south of the last stoplight on Route 1 the
world ends and begins again.
Our arrival must have been quite a sight
as, drenched to the skin, we ran from the
parking lot into the reception lobby. The
staff came out of the back office in full force
to welcome us. A long-awaited cup of hot
coffee was offered and accepted. After the
usual check-in ritual, a brave bellman took
us back into the storm and to our room.

The rooms were among the most beautiful
I have ever seen: they were designed for
pure relaxation. It was almost too perfect —
the natural wood and pastel colors blending
with the mountain terrain. A canopied bed
adjacent to a roaring fireplace, a large bay
window from which to watch the storm in
warmth and peace with only the sounds of
the fireplace, the rain and an occasional bolt
of thunder.
After drying off we decided to once again
brave the storm and make our way to the
dining room. Rather than drive, we opted to
walk along the lighted path through the for
est. The sounds of the storm were haunting
as we dashed along the path. The Ventana
Restaurant fits in perfectly with the rest of
this resort. Again, natural woods and wicker
combine man-made architecture with natu
ral surroundings. The food is fresh and ex
cellent, although not for the budget-minded.
The extensive wine list is superb.
Visitors to Ventana must understand that
they are away from civilization. Electricity
only came to this region in 1951. The res
taurant's shortage of Romaine lettuce to
make the Caesar salad 1 ordered was only
part of the price one pays for getting away
from it all. The guest rooms all have televi
sions discreetly hidden away in cedar
cabinets, but TV reception is spotty at best.
During our stay only one channel came in —
sort of. (The Inn does broadcast video
movies three times each day for those who
can't live without the tube.)
After a wonderful dinner, we made our
way back to our room. The restaurant staff,
seeing that we were less than enthusiastic
about running through the storm back to our
room, called the security patrol to drive us
home. By the time we reached our room, the
storm had let up significantly. The wind con
tinued its howling, but the driving rain was

slowly turning into a deep coastal fog.
We decided to explore the Japanese spas
and saunas as they were a fairly short walk
from our room. Both the baths and saunas
are cleverly designed to permit either single
sex or coed bathing under the stars, yet
protected from the wind. They are officially
open until 2 a.m., but nobody seemed to
mind if guests stayed later, as long as they
were quiet. In fitting with Ventana's natural
ambiance, clothing is optional in the spas
and saunas.
Above the pool there is a clothing
optional redwood sundeck. To help guests
loosen tight muscles, a professional massage
service is available. The guest rooms also
come stocked with a small bottle of body oil
for those who prefer to indulge in a private
massage session.
As morning broke over Ventana, the sun
managed to fight its way through the thick
fog. The deep green of the mountains, the
rich blue of sky and sea all seemed to come
alive. Complimentary breakfast is served in
the reception lobby before a roaring fire, or
guests may eat on the open air deck. A
simple phone call can get your breakfast
promptly delivered to your room.
