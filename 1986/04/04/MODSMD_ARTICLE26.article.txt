# Big Sur: Rugged beauty offers something for all
## 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN 
Just south of the Monterey Peninsula the
coast erupts into a series of glorious cliffs,
vistas, mountains and rugged beaches known
as Big Sur. The crowds have disappeared and
there are only a few lonely cows and sheep to
keep travelers company. Beyond the high
way, an endless horizon of sea crashes into
tall cliffs and beyond into the redwood
covered mountains. The effect is awesome.
Although the actual village of Big Sur is
only a tiny outpost 26 miles south of Carmel,
most visitors use that name .to refer to the
entire coastline between San Simion and
Carmel Valley. Big Sur is many things. To
many Bay Area residents who have never
experienced Big Sur's beauty, this region is
simply the spot they hear about on TV every
winter when the inevitable mudslides wipe
out the Pacific Coast Highway.
Yet Big Sur is more than just a place. Big
Sur is an experience. Visitors cannot help but
stop and ponder the meaning of life in the
natural beauty of this wonderland. The long
open stretches of deserted coastline seem to
have been custom-designed for meditation.
It is no wonder that New York Times writer
Herbert Gold once described Big Sur as
"one of the most lovely places and special
spots in the world."
Attractions at Big Sur:
Whale watching: The southward migration
of the California gray whales takes these
huge creatures past Big Sur on their way
from the Arctic to Baja during the months of
November through January.
Pfeiffer Beach: A wonderful beach with
scenic rock formations along the cliffs. There

is an excellent shallow lagoon which is a fa
vorite of both locals and visitors. Swimming
is reported to be highly dangerous due to the
pounding surf, but the beach is excellent for
photography, relaxation or tide pool explo
ration.
Point Sur Light Station: About a 10-
minute drive north of Ventana, it can be seen
from the highway, although access to the
lighthouse was closed during our visit. The
million-candlepower light has been seen by
ships at sea since 1889.
Bixby Creek Bridge: By far the most
photographed bridge along the coastal high
way, it is the largest solid concrete span in
the world.
Nepenthe: A local watering hole located l /z
mile south of Ventana. Originally bought by
Orson Wells for Rita Hayworth. Definitely
worth having a drink on their open air deck
on a warm night.
Partington Cove: Originally developed as
a ship landing during the tanbark industry's
boom around the turn of the century. Some
traces of the landing still remain. Described
in guide books as the "epitome of a smug
gler s cove." Excellent tidepools.
Hearst Castle — San Simeon: The world
famous castle of muckraking publisher
William Randolph Hearst. Absolutely spec
tacular architecture in the style of a
European palace. Tours are given by the
state and advance reservations are recom
mended through Ticketron outlet*
Esalen Institute: Home of the self
awareness and human potential movement
and site of spectacular natural hot springs.
Although private, Esalen opens the hot
springs to the public during certain hours.
