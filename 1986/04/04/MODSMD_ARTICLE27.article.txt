## Morales leads Card into first-day lead 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS â€” Amidst the
awe-inspiring grandeur of the Indiana
University Natatorium, defending
champion Stanford made itself at
home, broke a few records and
walked away with 105 points and the
lead after the first day of competition
at the NCAA championships.
Florida led a tightly-packed group
of challengers with 101 points.
Repeat champion performances by
Pablo Morales and the 400-yard med
ley relay team of Sean Murphy, John
Moffet, Morales and Dave Lundberg
earned a significant chunk of Stan
ford's points.
Morales won the 200 individual
medley for the second year in a row
and also set a new pool record of
1:45.43. Stanford Coach Skip Ken
ney called Morales "one of the most
gifted, talented swimmers ever at the
NCAAs."
Morales analyzed his victory in
light of the squad, "I'm more con
cerned with the team race here," he
said. "I'll do whatever I can to help
our team get points."
Morales also swam the butterfly leg
of the champion 400 medley relay
which set a new pool record of
3:12.45 in the trials.
Stanford anchorman Dave
Lundberg touched the wall just .45 of
a second ahead of hard-charging
UCLA to capture valuable points.
Stanford's Jeff Kostoff kicked hard
behind Florida's Matt Cetlinski and
Jason Gorie to earn a third-place
finish in the 500 freestyle. He im
proved two places over his finish in
last year's meet.
Plus, senior John Moffet inched
ahead in the breaststroke leg of the
400 medley relay and added consola
tion points with a 13th-place finish in
the 200 individual medley.
In the 50 yard freestyle, Califor
nia's Matt Biondi totally dominated
in the absence of any Stanford com
petitors. Biondi blazed to a pool and
U.S. record of 19.22.
The leading point margin for Stan
ford was established by Thor Johnson
and Tom Rothenbucher who finished
sixth and seventh respectively in the
one meter diving finals. "I was very,
very pleasantly surprised," Kenney
said of his divers' performances.
Both today and tomorrow 13 races
will be raced, so this morning's

prelimimaries will be crucial for the
Cardinal. "The NCAAs are won or
lost in the prelims," Kenney said.
Swimmers who make it to the finals
are guaranteed team points, and Ken
ney said, "We'll swim for time in the
morning and race at night."
Stanford's hopes for a repeat title
were dimmed before the team even
reached Indianapolis, though, as
sophomore Anthony Mosse sprained
an ankle boarding the airplane in San
Francisco. While Mosse is expected
to compete, he will probably not be at
full strength. "It feels much better,
we'll have to see tomorrow," the but
terflier said of his ankle.

Florida.
