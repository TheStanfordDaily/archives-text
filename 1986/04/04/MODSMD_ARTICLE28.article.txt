Nice. Great. Raring. Crucial. Psyched.
Fabulous. Fun. Pivotal. Tremendous.
All of these quotes came from players
and coaches describing the festivities that
start today at noon on the Varsity Tennis
Courts.
The sixth-ranked Stanford Cardinal will
host fifth-ranked UCLA this afternoon
and fourth-ranked USC tomorrow after
noon and evening in one of the biggest col
legiate tennis weekends of the year.
The USC match will be both indoors and
outdoors. The No. 1 and 2 singles and the
No. 1 doubles will be held in Maples Pavil
lion starting at 6:30 p.m., while the rest of

the matches will begin at noon on the Var
sity Courts.
"This is a nice package," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said yesterday."The
top three players in the nation are all
piaying here within a two-day span. It
should be fun to watch."
Those three are No. 1 Rick Leach of
USC, No. 2 Dan Goldie of Stanford, and
No. 3 Brad Pearce of UCLA. In all
likelihood, Goldie will play Pearce today
and then Leach tomorrow in the headlin
ing indoor match.
Both team matches are important for
the national rankings and, in turn, the
seedings for the NCAA tournament in
May.
Stanford is coming off a disappointing 6-

2 loss to Long Beach State Tuesday, which
dropped the Cardinal's record to 8-2 (2-0
in the Pac-10). Gould hopes his team will
rebound.
"We're healthy and rarin' to go," he
said. "Hopefully we'll get this unpredicta
ble Cardinal team back in the swing."
"I'm psyched," Cardinal junior Scott
Moody said. "We've been in a little slump
and this is the challenge to pull us out of it.
I think we all realize we've got something
to prove."
On the other hand, UCLA defeated
Chapman College Tuesday to raise its
record to 19-1 overall. The Bruins are un
defeated in Pac-10 play with a 5-0 record.
"They're as good a competing team as
there is," Gould said on Tuesday. "If they

can beat you 9-0 (as a team), 6-0, 6-0 (in
every match), then they're going to try as
hard as they can to do that."
Besides Pearce, the UCLA squad has
four players ranked in the top 100. No. 33
senior Michael Kures has a 14-3 record on
the year and teams with Dan Nahirney to
form the lOth-ranked doubles team in the
country.
No. 39 Tim Trigueiro, No. 64 Brett
Greenwood. Nahirney and freshman Buff
Farrow round out the top six players for
the Bruins.
Saturday's Cardinal-Trojan matchup
will feature the collegiate singles match
that everyone's been waiting for: Leach
versus (Joldie.
"I think the matchup between
Ricky and Goldie should he
fabulous.*' USC Coach Dick Leach
(Ricky's father) said. "Ricky's never
beaten Goldie. so he's really looking
forward to it."
In another big match that will be
played Saturday night. Stanford
senior Jim Grabb w ill probably play
freshman sensation Luke Jensen, who
is currently ranked 12th in the nation.
"The No. I and No. 2 singles w ill
be pivotal because that's Stanford's
strength." Leach said. "If either team
sweeps, then (that team) should win."
The indoor doubles match should
pair the I2th-ranked team of Goldie
and Grabb versus No. 3 Leach and
Pawsat of USC. For the indoor
matches, a carpet will be stretched
out over the basketball floor at
Maples.
"(The indoor court) will be a tre
mendous disadvantage to us.' Leach
said. "We only see it once every two
years. On the other hand, the great
exposure it gives for college tennis
overrides the disadvantage."
Gould disagrees with Leach's com
plaint. "In fact, our (outdoor) courts
are slower than SC's. so going indoors
to the fast court is more of a change
for us than for them." he said.

can beat you 9-0 (as a team), 6-0, 6-0 (in
every match), then they're going to try as
hard as they can to do that."
Besides Pearce, the UCLA squad has
four players ranked in the top 100. No. 33
senior Michael Kures has a 14-3 record on
the year and teams with Dan Nahirney to
form the lOth-ranked doubles team in the
country.

Saturday's Cardinal-Trojan matchup
will feature the collegiate singles match
that everyone's been waiting for: Leach
versus (Joldie.
"I think the matchup between
Ricky and Goldie should he
fabulous.*' USC Coach Dick Leach
(Ricky's father) said. "Ricky's never
beaten Goldie. so he's really looking
forward to it."
In another big match that will be
played Saturday night. Stanford
senior Jim Grabb w ill probably play
freshman sensation Luke Jensen, who
is currently ranked 12th in the nation.
"The No. I and No. 2 singles w ill
be pivotal because that's Stanford's
strength." Leach said. "If either team
sweeps, then (that team) should win."
The indoor doubles match should
pair the I2th-ranked team of Goldie
and Grabb versus No. 3 Leach and
Pawsat of USC. For the indoor
matches, a carpet will be stretched
out over the basketball floor at
Maples.
"(The indoor court) will be a tre
mendous disadvantage to us.' Leach
said. "We only see it once every two
years. On the other hand, the great
exposure it gives for college tennis
overrides the disadvantage."
Gould disagrees with Leach's com
plaint. "In fact, our (outdoor) courts
are slower than SC's. so going indoors
to the fast court is more of a change
for us than for them." he said.
