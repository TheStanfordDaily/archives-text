# Ten teams shoot for gym title in Lincoln
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
LINCOLN, Neb. â€” For the last couple of
days their minds have been preocecupied by a
plane flight similar to the one John Lithgow
took in "The Twilight Zone," a Nebraskan tor
nado watch and Denny's. But now, as you read
this, every ounce of the Stanford gymnasts'
bodies, minds and souls are zeroing in on one
thing: the NCAA championships.
Tonight at 7 p.m. in the University of Ne
braska's Devaney Sports Center, the No. 2-
ranked Cardinal will begin two days of intense
gymnastics which it hopes will culminate with an
NCAA title. Standing in its way are No. I Ne
braska. No. 3 UCLA, No. 4 lowa, and No. 5
Arizona State.
For an idea of how tightly these teams are
packed together, one need only notice that
ASU's average score is but .84 points lower
than Nebraska's. The point drop from the Sun
Devils to No. 6 Ohio State, the 1985 NCAA
champ, is 1.86.
Despite that last figure, many of the coaches
here agreed with Southern Illinois Coach Bill
Meade's statement: "The champion could be
any one of the top 10."
For some teams, how the entire squad does
depends on the performance of a couple of
gymnasts. Brian Ginsberg and Robby Campbell
will lead the UCLA contingent. "I feel these
two gymnasts, for us to win. have to have out
standing competitions," UCLA Coach Art
Shurlock said.
The Cornhuskers are depending on Tom
Schlesinger. Mike Epperson and defending
NCAA all-around champion Wes Suter. "If Ne

braska's gonna win , you're gonna see them per
form like gangbusters," Nebraska Coach
Francis Allen said.
Two Stanford gymnasts. Randy Besosa and
Jon Louis, are good bets to be among the
leaders in the individual competition. That one
of them will actually come out on top is also a
possibility, as their season average of six-event
scores places them third and fifth in the nation,
respectively.
The individual race promises to be as tough as
the team competition. "I think there's about
eight guys that, if everyone hit. we'd all tie for
first place," Besosa said.
This evening, the arena will be the site of
more than three hours of startling feats of
strength, agility, quickness and courage. And.
occasionally, insanity, as 10 teams and two
groups of individual qualifiers rotate through
the six events.
The top three teams from tonight's
preliminaries will go at it again for the title to
morrow afternoon at 1 p.m. The preliminaries
will determine the all-around individual cham
pion.
Tomorrow night, the individual event cham
pionships will be held at 7 p.m.
Despite the fact that this is the "training
ground for the '88 Olympics," as Allen put it.
and despite the fact that "this meet seems to put
more weight on the shoulders of the individual
because it is the big team meet," according to
Meade. Besosa is not especially nervous. He
thinks his attitude is the same as Stanford's as a
whole.
"I like big meets, I think that's typical for our
team." he said. "The bigger the meet, the better
we perform."

Gary Smith probably doesn't get the same thrills on the high bar that he
did on the Stanford gymnastics team's harrowing flight to Lincoln,
Neb., but he and the rest of the team arrived safely and are primed for
the NCAA competition.
