Stanford alumnus William Hewlett,
a co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard
computer firm, has pledged $50 mil
lion to the University's upcoming
Centennial Campaign, University
President Donald Kennedy an
nounced at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
Kennedy said the pledge, the larg
est financial gift Stanford has ever
received from an individual donor, is
"a wonderful, energy-providing
start" to the Centennial Campaign.
Kennedy and University Provost
James Rosse also reported on the
latest developments in relations be
tween the Hoover Institution and the
rest of Stanford at the lengthy senate
meeting.
The $50 million gift, to be dis
tributed in equal increments over the
next five years, will be used to help
fund the revitalization of the Univer
sity's science and engineering
facilities as well as endow scholar
ships and fellowships for Stanford un
dergraduates and graduate students.
The lion's share of the gift, some
$40 million, is earmarked for the
$250 million "Near West Campus"
redevelopment project. Additional
funding for the 10-year project to
construct a new science and engineer
ing commons will be obtained from
other donors and University bond is
sues.
The remaining $10 million is a
challenge gift matching other gifts to
a scholarship fund.
"It will mean a great deal to our
capacity to deliver over the long
range future our commitment to
need-blind admissions as well as to
the continued excellence and diver
sity of our undergraduate and
graduate student bodies." Kennedy
said.
In commenting on his unprece
dented pledge, Hewlett, the current
vice-chairman of the Hewlett-
Packard board, told the University
News Service that Stanford "has been
important to me and my family, to my
company, to this community and to
the nation.
"I want to see it strengthened for
the future so that it will continue to
benefit society through educating

promising young people and per
forming research essential to the
progress of mankind," he said.
The Kennedy and Rosse presenta
tion was in response to two reports
investigating University-Hoover rela
tions. The most recent report,
released in May 19K5, was authored
by a Faculty Senate committee
chaired by Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch.
The duties of a newly named
Hoover Institution administrator and
the establishment of guidelines for
search and review procedures for ap
pointing Hoover senior research fel
lows are a few of the recently imple-

merited ways to "improve the climate
of cooperation and understanding"
between Hoover and Stanford, Ken
nedy said.
The administrator, John Cogan.
was appointed Hoover associate
director late last year and serves as "a
liaison to the University administra
tion on matters of mutual interest to
Hoover and the rest of Stanford,"
Kennedy said.
The Dornbusch report had
criticized the President's Office for a
lack of a systematic review process of
proposed appointments of Hoover
senior fellows, suggested clarification
of the titles and rankings of Hoover
scholars and faculty professors, and
urged Kennedy to appoint a commit
