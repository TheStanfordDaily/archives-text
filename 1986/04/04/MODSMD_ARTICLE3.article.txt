# Hewlett offers $50 million gift
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Stanford alumnus William Hewlett,
a co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard
computer firm, has pledged $50 mil
lion to the University's upcoming
Centennial Campaign, University
President Donald Kennedy an
nounced at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
Kennedy said the pledge, the larg
est financial gift Stanford has ever
received from an individual donor, is
"a wonderful, energy-providing
start" to the Centennial Campaign.
Kennedy and University Provost
James Rosse also reported on the
latest developments in relations be
tween the Hoover Institution and the
rest of Stanford at the lengthy senate
meeting.
The $50 million gift, to be dis
tributed in equal increments over the
next five years, will be used to help
fund the revitalization of the Univer
sity's science and engineering
facilities as well as endow scholar
ships and fellowships for Stanford un
dergraduates and graduate students.
The lion's share of the gift, some
$40 million, is earmarked for the
$250 million "Near West Campus"
redevelopment project. Additional
funding for the 10-year project to
construct a new science and engineer
ing commons will be obtained from
other donors and University bond is
sues.
The remaining $10 million is a
challenge gift matching other gifts to
a scholarship fund.
"It will mean a great deal to our
capacity to deliver over the long
range future our commitment to
need-blind admissions as well as to
the continued excellence and diver
sity of our undergraduate and
graduate student bodies." Kennedy
said.
In commenting on his unprece
dented pledge, Hewlett, the current
vice-chairman of the Hewlett-
Packard board, told the University
News Service that Stanford "has been
important to me and my family, to my
company, to this community and to
the nation.
"I want to see it strengthened for
the future so that it will continue to
benefit society through educating

promising young people and per
forming research essential to the
progress of mankind," he said.
The Kennedy and Rosse presenta
tion was in response to two reports
investigating University-Hoover rela
tions. The most recent report,
released in May 19K5, was authored
by a Faculty Senate committee
chaired by Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch.
The duties of a newly named
Hoover Institution administrator and
the establishment of guidelines for
search and review procedures for ap
pointing Hoover senior research fel
lows are a few of the recently imple-

merited ways to "improve the climate
of cooperation and understanding"
between Hoover and Stanford, Ken
nedy said.
The administrator, John Cogan.
was appointed Hoover associate
director late last year and serves as "a
liaison to the University administra
tion on matters of mutual interest to
Hoover and the rest of Stanford,"
Kennedy said.
The Dornbusch report had
criticized the President's Office for a
lack of a systematic review process of
proposed appointments of Hoover
senior fellows, suggested clarification
of the titles and rankings of Hoover
scholars and faculty professors, and
urged Kennedy to appoint a commit

Co-founder of Hewlett-Pac kurd
tee to study relations between the
Hoover and University libraries.
The committee report also encour
aged increased communication and
interaction between Hoover and the
rest of the University as well as more
precise definition of the relationship
between Hoover and University
governing authority to alleviate any
possible concerns of political ad
vocacy in the institution.
In the 10 months since the release
of the Dornbusch report, the Univer
sity and Hoover have "formalized
and certainly tightened up" the
search and appointment procedures
for Hoover senior fellows. Kennedy
said.
The new procedure will be more in
line with the structure and methods
used in other University academic ap
pointments. Rosse said.
'"Our aim has been to ensure

search and appointment procedures
for senior fellows that are equivalent
in their care and rigor to those used
for senior members of the profes
soriate. but within the frame of
governance appropriate to the
Hoover Institution." Rosse said.
The procedure calls for a Hoover
search committee to submit appoint
ment recommendations to Hoover
Director W. Glen Campbell, who will
will forward the recommendation to
the University President after discus
sion with Hoover senior fellows.
Upon receipt of a recommenda
tion. the University President will ap
point an ad hoc committee, including
two members of the Academic Coun
cil and two scholars in the candidate's
field, to review the qualifications of
the candidate as well as ensure ad
herence to procedural standards.
According to Rosse,
■'experimental" versions of these pro
cedures were used in the January ap
pointment of Senior Fellow Bruce
Bueno de Merquita.

Dornbusch called the appointment
procedures instituted by Hoover and
the resulting review process "fully
compatible with the spirit of the
recommendations of our committee."
But a leading critic of the Hoover
Institution. English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz. equated the subject of the
Kennedy and Rosse report with
'"buying earthquake insurance after
the entire campus has fallen down."
The new appointment procedures do
not affect those who were appointed
under the previous inadequate stand
ards, Rebholz told the senate.
Proposed procedures could not be
retroactive. Kennedy responded.
"Our power is limited to making
changes in the present and the
future," he said.
Rebholz also charged that the new
procedures still do not address the
"central problem" at Hoover — al
leged political activity and a
"research agenda" — that he said
continue to "compromise the in
tegrity" of Stanford.

will forward the recommendation to
the University President after discus
sion with Hoover senior fellows.
Upon receipt of a recommenda
tion. the University President will ap
point an ad hoc committee, including
two members of the Academic Coun
cil and two scholars in the candidate's
field, to review the qualifications of
the candidate as well as ensure ad
herence to procedural standards.
According to Rosse,
■'experimental" versions of these pro
cedures were used in the January ap
pointment of Senior Fellow Bruce
Bueno de Merquita.

Dornbusch called the appointment
procedures instituted by Hoover and
the resulting review process "fully
compatible with the spirit of the
recommendations of our committee."
But a leading critic of the Hoover
Institution. English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz. equated the subject of the
Kennedy and Rosse report with
'"buying earthquake insurance after
the entire campus has fallen down."
The new appointment procedures do
not affect those who were appointed
under the previous inadequate stand
ards, Rebholz told the senate.
Proposed procedures could not be
retroactive. Kennedy responded.
"Our power is limited to making
changes in the present and the
future," he said.
Rebholz also charged that the new
procedures still do not address the
"central problem" at Hoover — al
leged political activity and a
"research agenda" — that he said
continue to "compromise the in
tegrity" of Stanford.
Stanford alumnus William Hewlett,
a co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard
computer firm, has pledged $50 mil
lion to the University's upcoming
Centennial Campaign, University
President Donald Kennedy an
nounced at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
Kennedy said the pledge, the larg
est financial gift Stanford has ever
received from an individual donor, is
"a wonderful, energy-providing
start" to the Centennial Campaign.
Kennedy and University Provost
James Rosse also reported on the
latest developments in relations be
tween the Hoover Institution and the
rest of Stanford at the lengthy senate
meeting.
The $50 million gift, to be dis
tributed in equal increments over the
next five years, will be used to help
fund the revitalization of the Univer
sity's science and engineering
facilities as well as endow scholar
ships and fellowships for Stanford un
dergraduates and graduate students.
The lion's share of the gift, some
$40 million, is earmarked for the
$250 million "Near West Campus"
redevelopment project. Additional
funding for the 10-year project to
construct a new science and engineer
ing commons will be obtained from
other donors and University bond is
sues.
The remaining $10 million is a
challenge gift matching other gifts to
a scholarship fund.
"It will mean a great deal to our
capacity to deliver over the long
range future our commitment to
need-blind admissions as well as to
the continued excellence and diver
sity of our undergraduate and
graduate student bodies." Kennedy
said.
In commenting on his unprece
dented pledge, Hewlett, the current
vice-chairman of the Hewlett-
Packard board, told the University
News Service that Stanford "has been
important to me and my family, to my
company, to this community and to
the nation.
"I want to see it strengthened for
the future so that it will continue to
benefit society through educating

promising young people and per
forming research essential to the
progress of mankind," he said.
The Kennedy and Rosse presenta
tion was in response to two reports
investigating University-Hoover rela
tions. The most recent report,
released in May 19K5, was authored
by a Faculty Senate committee
chaired by Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch.
The duties of a newly named
Hoover Institution administrator and
the establishment of guidelines for
search and review procedures for ap
pointing Hoover senior research fel
lows are a few of the recently imple-

merited ways to "improve the climate
of cooperation and understanding"
between Hoover and Stanford, Ken
nedy said.
The administrator, John Cogan.
was appointed Hoover associate
director late last year and serves as "a
liaison to the University administra
tion on matters of mutual interest to
Hoover and the rest of Stanford,"
Kennedy said.
The Dornbusch report had
criticized the President's Office for a
lack of a systematic review process of
proposed appointments of Hoover
senior fellows, suggested clarification
of the titles and rankings of Hoover
scholars and faculty professors, and
urged Kennedy to appoint a commit

tee to study relations between the
Hoover and University libraries.
The committee report also encour
aged increased communication and
interaction between Hoover and the
rest of the University as well as more
precise definition of the relationship
between Hoover and University
governing authority to alleviate any
possible concerns of political ad
vocacy in the institution.
In the 10 months since the release
of the Dornbusch report, the Univer
sity and Hoover have "formalized
and certainly tightened up" the
search and appointment procedures
for Hoover senior fellows. Kennedy
said.
The new procedure will be more in
line with the structure and methods
used in other University academic ap
pointments. Rosse said.
'"Our aim has been to ensure

search and appointment procedures
for senior fellows that are equivalent
in their care and rigor to those used
for senior members of the profes
soriate. but within the frame of
governance appropriate to the
Hoover Institution." Rosse said.

search committee to submit appoint
