When Stanford and USC meet in women's ten
nis, very little needs to he said to hype the match.
"I think it's one of the great rivalries," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said Wednesday, prior to
leaving for Los Angeles for today's I p.m. match
with the Trojans. Tomorrow, the Cardinal travels
further south for a 10 a.m. match with San Diego
State.
Stanford and USC have taken turns ruling the
collegiate tennis world since the NCAA was
created for women's tennis in 1982. The Cardinal
won the NCAA championship in '82 and '84, and
the Trojans brought home the title in '83 and '85.
In past years the two teams have played some
tremendous dual matches. USC edged Stanford 5-
4 in Los Angeles last year, handing the Cardinal its
only regular-season loss in the past three seasons.
The following month Stanford returned the favor
with a 5-4 victory over the Trojans on the Farm..
"We're always real close," Brennan said.
The Cardinal and Trojans shared the No. I spot
in the rankings at the beginning of the 1986 season.
Though Stanford is 10-0 and USC is 13-1 this
season, both are behind Trinity in the latest NCAA
poll. When the new poll is released Monday,
however, the Cardinal should be No. 1 and the
Trojans No. 2 by virtue of Stanford's recent victory
over Trinity.
USC's only loss was in early February against
SDSU. Since then the Trojans have been invin
cible: in recent weeks they have blanked UCLA 9-
0 and thumped the A/tecs 8-1.
"That (the loss against SDSU) was a rather
quirky loss," Brennan said. "They (the Trojans)
are obviously one of the top two or three teams.
They annihilated UCLA.
Leading the Trojans and the nation has been
Caroline Kuhlman. The USC sophomore is ranked
No. 1 nationally with a 10-0 record, including the
singles championship at the Riviera Collegiate In
vitational on Feb. 2.
"Fve got to say that right now she's the No. 1
player," Brennan said. "She's the most consistent
player the NCAA has had the last few years."
The No. I and 2 singles matches today will not
only be crucial to the outcome of the match but
should also be two of the most exciting matches of
the season.
In the feature match. Stanford's Patty Fendick
will battle Kuhlman. Fendick. 6-3 on the season
after an 0-2 start, is one of the top athletes in the
nation and is just as talented as Kuhlman.
The No. 2 match will showcase two players
