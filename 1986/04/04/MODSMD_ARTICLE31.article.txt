# Card looks to steal series
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
No baseball fan could ask for more.
America's favorite game played under the sun between
two top teams duking it out for first place. Heaven on
earth, right'.' Get those coolers and beach towels ready be
cause here comes the first pitch.
I here s only one problem for Stanford fans who are
eager to watch the Cardinal, at 7-3 the Pacific 10 South
ern Division leader, take on 6-4 UCLA, its nearest Six-
Pac challenger. I he three-game weekend set, which
begins today at 2 p.m.. will be played some 300 miles to
the south, in Los Angeles.
I hat s a long way to go, even for baseball.
But it there's one Six-Pac series that might put the faint
of heart into the road-trip mood, this one should be it. So
come on down to Jackie Robinson Diamond, it's still
early, really early, in the quarter, if you know what I
mean.
"It's big, real big," said Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess. "You can put too much emphasis on it because
its only one series (among many), but we'll be playing for
first place. We want to stay there, and they want to take it
over."
And for those hard-core rooters, there's an extra attrac
tion. 1 he series should be a test of philosophies: Stan
ford's finesse against UCLA's muscle.
"They've got great team power," Marquess said. "They
don't do a lot in terms of running. They kind of lay back
waiting for the big inning."
As a team, UCLA (20-12) has pounded 48 round trip
pers. I ory Lovullo, who has feasted on Stanford's pitching
staff in the past, leads the club with 10. The left-handed
hitting second baseman — "on a tear for the last month or

so." according to Marquess — has hit over .320 against
Stanford during his two years at UCLA. What's more, he
poked a home run at Sunken Diamond less than a month
ago during a 4-2 Stanford win.
By contrast, Stanford has hit only 13 home runs in 31
contests. Marquess' team is led by center fielder Mark
Davis' three.
What Stanford lacks in power, however, it makes up for
with basepath aggressiveness. The Cardinal has swiped 91
bases in 119 tries so far. Walt Harris has been most active,
stealing 21: Toi Cook and Davis each have 15.
Compared to Stanford, the lead-footed Bruins haven't
had even gotten out of the blocks. UCLA has attempted
to steal 40 times — and has been caught in half of those
tries.
On top of this clash of grand baseball philosophies, the
series promises to feature fine pitching. Stanford comes in
with the Six-Pac's lowest team ERA (3.35) and boasts the
league's hottest pitcher, Jack McDowell. The sophomore
right-hander, today's starter unless rumors about soreness
in his shoulder are confirmed, is 8-1 with a 1.63 ERA, the
league's best.
McDowell, who has already beaten UCLA once this
year, will face Randy Hennis, 4-4 with a 3.94 ERA.
Even though his staffs numbers aren't too shabby,
Marquess is still impressed with UCLA's arms. "I think
they (UCLA) could make a real good claim to having the
best pitching in the conference," he said.
Marquess said Lee Plemel, named the Pac-10's pitcher
of the week after he shut out Arizona State on three hits
last Saturday, would start Sunday's 1 p.m. finale. Either
Rob Wassenaar or Kevin Kunkel will get the call for Sat
urday afternoon's 1 p.m. game.
The games will be broadcast by KZSU 90.1 FM.
