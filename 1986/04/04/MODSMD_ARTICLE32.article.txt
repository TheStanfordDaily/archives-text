## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Capping an explosive season
and aiming for the NCAA nation
als, the Stanford women's gymnas
tics team will invade the North
western Regionals in Corvallis,
Ore., this weekend in what will
hopefully be a Cardinal coup
d'etat.
"I think three teams from the
region will make nationals, maybe
a fourth," Stanford Coach Homer
Sardina said. "I want us to be the
fourth.
"Jinny Rhee and Nancy
Goldsmith will be our guns," Sar
dina said. "Nancy is looking really
good, and, like always, I expect
Jinny to do well."
Sardina is also relying on senior
Pam Blom. "Pam has used a
double flyaway on bars, so she is
confident, and she can make it to
nationals on vault." he said.
"Jinny could also go to nationals
in the all-around," Sardina added.

Sardina expects heated compe
tition. "This is where everyone
goes for broke," he said.
"Fullerton is the top seed at
185, and we're No. 6 with a 181
average score," Sardina noted.
"They have the edge because of
experience, and I've never seen
them falter under pressure.
They're a good pressure team.
"Next in line is Washington,"he
said. "They're hungry, but we can
take them if we hit our routines.
The team shares his confidence.
"We're going to do really well,"
freshman Jessica Armstrong said.
"1 think this will be our best
meet."
Sophomore Alison McGann
Agreed. "We really want to im
prove our standing nationally in
this meet and show ourselves to
the other teams," she added.
"I think we've had a good
season," freshman Sherri Evenson
said. "We'll go up there and give it
our all, and the outcome's the
outcome."
