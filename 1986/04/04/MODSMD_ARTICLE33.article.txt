# Golfers host tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
called it "a little family affair."
No, don't get your hopes up. Buffy
and Jody aren't coming to Stanford.
Neither is Mr. French. However,
some of the top women's golf teams
in the West are going to be here Sun
day for the opening round of the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate.
It is a small field (six teams), but a
very competitive one â€” Baldwin had
strong praise for nearly every team.
The competition is led by tourney
co-host San Jose State, which finished
second in the Lady Mustang in Dallas
two weeks ago, and previously won
the Lady Spartan in Monterey.
"(SJSU) is at the moment the
second or third-best team in the
country," Baldwin said.
SJSU is led by Julie Ralls, who
Baldwin says is "playing as good as
any college player in the country," as
well as three former Australian junior
champions: Libby Wilson, Anne
Jones and Lisa Ipkendanz.
"They're loaded," Baldwin said.
USC is also on a hot streak, having
finished second in the Arizona Inter
collegiate before winning the Lady
Spartan.
"They have done extremely well,"

Baldwin said. "They are a legitimate
top-10 team."
The Trojans boast Flori Prono, a
former junior world champion, Kim
Saiki, the 1984 USGA Junior Cham
pionship winner, and the 1984 Cali
fornia high school champion, fresh
man Kim Cathrein.
Also playing will be U.S. Interna
tional, which features two-time Ail-
American junior Laurette Maritz,
and Long Beach State.
Rounding out the competition is
Oregon State, the only team which
Baldwin seemed not to be threatened
by.
"(OSU) is a very average college
team," he said.
Then there is the host of this little
get-together, Stanford. The seventh
ranked Cardinal placed 10th in the
Lady Mustang and will again be with
out freshman Clare Dolan, who has
been sidelined three months with ten
dinitis. Stanford might also be missing
Kathleen McCarthy, who was asked
to play in the Dinah Shore Invita
tional this weekend.
So if Stanford can survive this tour
ney, it should be in good shape for the
home stretch of the season as it
begins to get its team back together.
The California Intercollegiate con
cludes Monday with 36 holes at the
Villages Golf Course at San Jose.
