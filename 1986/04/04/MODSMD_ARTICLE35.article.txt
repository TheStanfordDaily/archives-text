# Sailors wrap up eastern roadtrip

Coming off what Stanford Coach Joe Petrucci believed was
its best outing ever on the East Coast, the Cardinal sailing
team will conclude what Petrucci called a two-week
"training/road trip" east on Sunday in the Friis Trophy regatta
at Tufts University in Boston.
The Cardinal has been back East since March 25, practicing
at MIT and Tufts in order to become accustomed to the sailing
conditions under which the national championships will be
held.
That preparation paid big dividends last weekend at the
Boston Dinghy Cup hosted by Harvard. Stanford, ranked
14th in the nation entering the regatta, rode a fast start to a
third-place finish, beating several teams rated ahead of it in
the 18-team event.
Defending national champion Boston University won the
regatta, with No. 2 Navy finishing second.
"We had an outstanding regatta," Petrucci said. "We really
came out of the blocks strong."
Indeed, the Cardinal was in first place after 10 of the 36
races. Stanford slipped to sixth by the end of Saturday's races,
but a strategy of frequent lineup changes brought the Cardinal
up to third.
Petrucci decided to have each boat go as hard as it could for
two races, then switch sailors. "They couldn't have done a sit
up after they were done," he said.
