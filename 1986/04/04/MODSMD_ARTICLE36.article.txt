### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
The San Diego Crew Classic, one of the big
regattas of the crew season, attracts some of the
finest schools in the country, and the Stanford
men's crew team is one of them. The Cardinal is
in San Diego to compete in the Classic today
and tomorrow on Mission Bay.
The Cardinal headed south on Wednesday
taking five boats: a freshman eight, novice
eight, junior varsity eight and a varsity eight
and four. Yesterday, the team practiced in prep
aration for the preliminaries today and, pos
sibly, the finals tomorrow.
The team is optimistic about its chances,
having finished a strong fourth in this event last
year. Of the many teams competing, the main
competition, as always, will be Washington, the
school which virtually dominates West Coast
crew. Also participating will be some East Coast
schools, including powerhouse Yale.
The many fine teams in the field give the crew
team a good opportunity to further refine their
strategies for the fast-approaching Pacific Coast
Championships to be held in Sacramento.
"Boats-wise, this is the most important
regatta," Stanford coxswain Randy Chappel
said. "But the Pac-lOs is the most important."
