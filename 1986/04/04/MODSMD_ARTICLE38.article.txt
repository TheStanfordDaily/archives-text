# Spikers meet No. 1 USC

### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
After a 22-day layoff, the Stanford men's volleyball
team heads south to play four matches in six days. This
time, however, the trip is much more crucial than a similar
southern trip made earlier in the season.
Stanford, with a 10-5 overall record, is ranked seventh
in the nation, and is in fifth place in the California Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association. The Cardinal (8-5 in
league play) must finish in the league's top five to make
the NCAA regionals.
Unfortunately, the squad faces No. I and undefeated
USC tonight. This is the first time that the Cardinal has
faced the Trojans this year, although Stanford has already
played several other league teams twice.
I he Trojans, who defeated sixth-ranked UC-Santa
Barbara in five games last night, are 14-0 in the confer
ence. Junior outside hitters Adam Johnson and Dave
Voder (brother of fifth-year USC Coach Bob Yoder) lead
the team in kills with 381 and 293 respectively. Johnson
recorded 3 1 kills against the Gauchos and Yoder followed
with 29 in last night's action. Freshman middle blocker
Tom Duke has a .435 hitting percentage to go along with
his 282 kills.
"USC is the team we know least about," Stanford Co-
Coach Fred Sturm said. "They are quite good; better than
last year's team. USC is a strong side-out team. They pass

well and mix up their offense."
"USC is undefeated but beatable." Stanford outside
hitter Chis Braun said. "If we play well, we have a good
chance of beating them."
Tomorrow, Stanford faces ninth-place Cal State-
Northridge (3-11) in a match that might be tougher than it
sounds. The Cardinal downed the Matadors in three
games earlier in the season, but Northridge was without
the services of top hitter Chuck English. The senior
outside hitter will be in action against Stanford this
weekend.
"The first time we played them they didn't have their
best," Sturm said, "and they are the type of team that
plays well at home."
"Northridge will play tougher on their home court,"
Stanford freshman outside hitter Dave Johnson agreed.
"They've improved a lot. They have a young team."
Senior All-American candidate Braun continues to lead
the Cardinal with 253 kills. Sophomore Scott Fortune has
recorded 179, while senior outside hitter Jon Root has
147 and is second in hitting percentage at .322. Root,
however, is quetionable tonight due to an injured ankle.
Stephen Blue has the top average of .330.
"We can really solidify our place in the conference with
this road trip," Shaw said. "We can ensure ourselves a
spot in regionals."
In other vollyball news, senior Dan Parr has left the
team for personal reasons.
