The stars of the collegiate track
world will he shining in Texas this
weekend, and if all goes well for the
Stanford track team, a feu of the
Cardinal's better athletes will he
among them.
This afternoon and all day to
morrow. 17 members of the Stan
ford track squad will be taking part
in one of the nation's premier out
door meets: the Texas Relays in
Austin, Texas.
Unfortunately for Stanford, win
ning the team title will be out of the
question. The meet's entry list
reads like the latest rankings in
Track and Field News, and, as a
team, Stanford just doesn't have
that kind of firepower.
But all's not bad. There will be
about 30,000 people watching, and
if everything goes according to
schedule, a couple of Cardinal
women and a men's relay team

could jump into the national spot

which ranks second on the all-time
list.
Not too far behind is the men's
distance medley team of Steve
Schadler. Christian Skoog, Brian
Conolly and Jeff Atkinson. The
foursome is currently undefeated,
and they'd like nothing better than
to stay that way.
But keeping their streak alive
won't be easy: the distance medley

and Oregon, some of the best
squads in the countrv. In fact, it
could he the "best field ever as
sembled." Wollman said.
The other women with the po

competition will be Denise Gaz

Dickerson will be competing in
the discus. Bernhagen will enter the
high jump, and Hopp. who's en
tered in the 1.500 meters and
5.000. will be looking to continue
the comeback that began with this

ago, as a freshman, Hopp was an
NCAA national champion, but
since then she's been plagued by
career-stifling injuries.
