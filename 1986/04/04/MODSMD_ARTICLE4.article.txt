The University is changing its calendar
to avoid conflicts between Jewish High
Holy Days and the beginning of the aca
demic year, according to Rabbi Ari Car
tun. executive director of Stanford's Hillel
Foundation.
Last year, the first day of classes here
conflicted with Yom Kippur, the holiest
day of the Jewish calendar. Many faculty
members and students did not attend their
classes in order to observe the holiday.

Cartun said he met recently with Assis
tant Registrar Robert Thompson to set
calendars for the next 20 years.
"We went over the potential conflicts,
which are Orientation, registration and the
first two days of classes.'* Cartun said.
The dates for next year's Orientation
have not yet been set because the Univer
sity is adopting a shortened, computerized
registration.
"There are two days opening up that will
no longer be occupied by Maples Pavilion
registration, so the whole Orientation

process can he rethought." said Cartun. "I
want the administrators to be aware that
Orientation cannot conflict now (with
Jewish holidays) by administrative decree.
"Right now it's in Residential Educa
tion's court."he said. "I am confident that
they'll be creative in solving the problem."
Rosh Hashana (New Year) and Yom
Kippur (the Day of Atonement) are the
most sacred of the Jewish holy days. Using
the previously set academic calendar,
those holidays clash nine times in the next
20 years with Orientation, registration or
the first day of classes. Carton said.

Such conflicts have also occurred in past
years, causing faculty and students to
protest the incidents.
In 1983, Jewish faculty and students met
with University President Donald Ken
nedy to discuss preventing conflicts be
tween the Jewish holidays and registration,
according to Cartun. "Kennedy added on
Orientation, too. because that's the biggest
problem â€” Orientation sets the tone for
the student's entire University experi
ence," he said.
