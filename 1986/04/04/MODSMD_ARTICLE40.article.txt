European deals with Libya alleged
WASHINGTON — Fiance and Italy made secret deals with Libya
during the 1970s to spare their citizens from attack in exchange for
giving Libyan-sponsored terrorists the freedom to travel through
Europe, U.S. officials said yesterday.
I he deals, which have since collapsed, were discovered by Reagan
Administration officials last year when they attempted to bring the
Europeans into a united effort to pressure Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy, one aide said.
I he French had a deal with Libya and a deal with the PLO (Palestine
Liberation Organization)," a State Department official said. "Italy had
its own deals. The French used to think that between the PLO and the
I ihyans they had it all sewed up."
As a result, he said, "the French would look at a guy, a known terror
ist. as he went through their airports and not lift a finger."
l oday, officials said, such kid-gloves treatment is no more. The secret
pacts disintegrated after Libyan-based terrorists bombed restaurants in
Paris and attacked travelers at the Rome and Vienna airports last
December.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who discussed terrorism hist week
with officials in France, Italy and Greece, said that he is encouraged by
the Europeans' gradual movement toward more active cooperation with
I .S. efforts against terrorism and the U.S. campaign against Khadafy.
Put other officials said that they are still dissatisfied with the level of
the European effort and pointed to the now-defunct deals with Libya
and the PLO as examples of what the United States had to deal with.
A spokesman for Italy's embassy in Washington, Massimo Baistroc
chi. denied that his government had ever entered the kind of pact des
cribed bv the U.S. officials but acknowledged that the Italian intelligence
agencies did establish a cooperative relationship with Khadafy.
An official at France's embassy who asked not to be identified said he
could not confirm or deny the report of a deal. "If anything like that was
done, it was done some time ago, and secretly," he said. "We wouldn't
have any comment on it."
Chinese to study Soviet nuke power
PEKING — Senior Chinese officials, in an unusual press conference,
.nnounced yesterday that .Peking will send a delegation of nuclear ex
perls to the Soviet Union to study nuclear power plants there.
Vice Premier Li Peng, who is in charge of China's nuclear power pro
gram. also disclosed that China is cutting back on its anticipated pur
chases of foreign nuclear equipment and reactors, raising doubts about
the likelihood of mtiltibillion dollar nuclear sales to China by some west
ern companies.
Analysts said the main reason for the cutback was the drop in China's
foreign exchange reserves. The drop was caused by indiscriminate
spending on imports, construction and bonuses for industrial workers
that began in 1984 and continued into 1985, despite government at
tempts to stop it.
At the two-hour session. Li said China had changed the practice of
trying to import complete sets of nuclear power stations from abroad
and would rely more on its own efforts. He said China would decide
whether to purchase Soviet nuclear equipment after the study mission
made its report. The Soviets' civilian nuclear technology is said to be in
ferior to that of the western nations but it is also cheaper.
Western diplomats said the disclosure indicated another upgrading in
the economic relations between the two Communist powers. The eco
nomic ties have improved steadily in recent years despite a longstanding
ideological rift and persistent differences over foreign policy.
Weinberger stresses S. Korean ties
SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea and
its government is "complete and absolute."
He also said that there were no similarities between South Korea,
which he called a solidly united country making rapid economic prog
ress, and the Philippines, where an autocratic leader, Ferdinand Marcos,
was recently deposed with U.S. blessings.
Weinberger's three-day visit to South Korea, however, came within
days of a clash in Kwangju between riot police and demonstrators shout
ing " Down with dictatorship! Down with America!" The clash followed
a rally by 60,000 people, the largest anti-government gathering in South
Korea since president Chun Doo Hwan, a former army general, seized
power in 1980.
Asked at a pre-departure news conference if he felt that the United
Suites, which keeps 40,000 troops in South Korea, is helping to defend a
fully democratic nation, Weinberger said, "1 am satisfied that what we
are doing is essential for the preservation of the government in the
Republic of (South) Korea and for freedom and peace in the whole
peninsula. The American commitment to doing that is complete and ab
solute."
"In the next three years, our commitment and joint work is perhaps
more necessary than at any time in the immediate past," he declared,
saying that defense cooperation will "enable us to keep the peace" and
allow South Korea to host "these two international games . . . without
any disruption that North Korea or the Soviets may try to make.. .."
New evidence found in Aquino case
MANII A. Philippines — A Filipino man said yesterday that he has
unearthed new evidence showing that the gun used to assassinate former
Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. belonged to a military officer.
The unnamed official, a major in the constabulary force, however, had
reported losing the gun when his car was burglarized in 1979. four years
before Aquino was gunned down by an assassin on Aug. 2 I, 1983. at the
Manila airport.
Villa made the statements in an exclusive interview with Malaya, the
Philippines' largest-circulated daily newspaper.
Ownership of the gun contradicted the official military version that
the murder weapon was part of a cargo shipment form the United State*
pilfered in Bangkok before reaching the Philippines. Military lawyers
had convinced the inquiry panel that the gun. a .357 Magnum revolver,
was stolen in Bangkok.
But. Villa said the military official has given a sworn statement about
owning the weapon and identified a constabulary colonel that he
believed had stolen the gun from his car's golve compartment.
I he military had said the gun found its way into the hands of Rolando
Cuilman. who the military said shot Aquino before being gunned down
himself by Aquino's bodyguards.
1 he existence of new evidence could accelerate official proposals to
reopen the \quino case, which ended in December 1985. with the ac
quittal of the then-armed 112 orces chief. Gen. Fabian Ver. a civilian and 25
other military officers and soldiers, of charges of double murder.
