# Police allege Arab woman placed bomb

### 
Administration official holds Khadafy responsible for TWA explosion

ATHENS, Greece and SANTA BARBARA —
Greek police believe that an Arab woman pas
senger on a morning flight in the same plane at
tached a time bomb to the seat that blew out of"
TW A flight 840 near Athens Wednesday afternoon
killing four Americans, a police spokesman said
yesterday.
In another development, a senior Reagan Ad
ministration official yesterday held Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy responsible for the explosion
although Khadafy has denied any involvement.
I he woman, traveling under the name of May
Elias Mansour, occupied the fateful window seat,
No. I OF on the right side of the plane, during a
dawn flight of the Boeing 727 from Cairo that
arrived here at 8:25 a.m., the spokesman said, ask
ing that his name not be revealed. .
He said that Mansour left the flight in Athens
and waited in the airport transit lounge, where she
did not have to face a customs, immigration or
major security check, until 3:19 p.m. when she
boarded Middle East Airlines flight 254 to Beirut.
The suspect passenger, who Italian authorities
had said earlier was a known terrorist and ex
plosives expert, was therefore present in the airline
transit lounge when Flight 840 safely touched down
only a few hundred yards away, saved almost

miraculously by its pilot after the midair bomb blast
at 2:20 p.m. at 15,000 feet of altitude.
A Colombia-born U.S. citizen, Alberto Ospina
ol Stratford, Conn., was sitting in seat 10-F when
the explosion occurred, blowing him out of the
plane to his death. Three other Americans from
Annapolis, Md., Dimitra Stylian, 52, her daughter
Maria Klug, 25, and Klug's 3-month-old daughter
Dimitra, seated nearby, were either blown through
the 9-foot by 3-foot hole left by the explosion in
the right fuselage or sucked through it by wind and
air pressure.
1 he possibility that a terrorist on an earlier leg of
the flight placed the bomb in the plane was first
voiced by Italian airport security officials in Rome.
Although the Greek police have primary respon
sibility for investigating the cause of the explosion,
they said they have welcomed 18 agents of the FBI
and eight specialists from the U.S. Federal Avia
tion Administration to take an active role in the
case.
Meanwhile, in Santa Barbara, a senior Adminis
tration official vowed to hold Libyan leader Moam
mar Khadafy responsible for Wednesday s explo
sion aboard a TWA airliner even if no direct link
can be found between him and the bombing.
"He certainly helped create the climate in which
this took place," the official told reporters. "We

will take some action, just as we took action after
Rome and Vienna."
The Administration applied stiff economic sanc
tions against Libya early this year after Khadafy of
fered safe haven to Abu Nidal, the radical Palestin
ian believed responsible for the Christmas season
airport bombings in Rome and Vienna.
Some Administration officials concede that the
recent naval exercises in the Gulf of Sidra, which
resulted in an exchange of missile fire between the
U.S. and Libyan forces, were designed to provoke
Kadafi in the wake of the Rome and Vienna inci
dents.
Khadafy has denied any involvement in the
TWA explosion, but White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said that "his denials by themselves
mean nothing" in the context of his past record on
such matters.
Even though a group that calls themselves the
Arab Revolutionary Cell has stepped forward to
claim responsibility for the airline explosion,
Speakes said the case was far from closed.
Asked if the Administration was contemplating a
military response, Speakes said that was "an iffy
zone" and refused to elaborate. The official who
spoke on background similarly refused to specify
what steps were under consideration.
