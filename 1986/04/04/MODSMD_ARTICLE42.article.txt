# Astronauts call for separate safety panel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The senior
members of NASA's astronaut corps
yesterday called for appointment of a
safety organization independent of
shuttle program management as the
first line of defense against another
space accident like the Jan. 28 Chal
lenger tragedy.
William Rogers, chairman of the
presidential commission investigating
the catastrophe, said that the com
mission already had given serious
consideration to such a safety panel,
and he indicated that it would be
among the recommendations to the
president when the investigation is
completed. He urged the astronauts

to submit more specific recommen
dations on the organization and oper
ation of the proposed panel.
Appearing before the commission
yesterday, four verteran shuttle com
manders said the new organization
should be comparable to military
flight safety organizations, with over
sight throughout flight operations ac
tivities and having an independent
chain of command.
Calling for a "fool proof' system to
zero in on safety problems, chief
astronaut John Young declared.
" Unless we take veiy positive steps to
open safety communications and to

identify and fix early-on safety prob
lems, we are asking for another
shuttle accident."
The appearance of Young and the
other astronauts moved the presiden
tial commission into its final phase, an
effort to shape recommendations to
avert another space accident like the
Challenger explosion, which took the
lives of seven astronauts and brought
the American space program to a
standstill for at least a year.
When the panel was named in the
wake of the tragedy. President
Reagan ordered it not only to
produce a finding of probable cause
for the accident, but to recommend

remedial steps that should be taken
before shuttle flights resume.
Within the first few weeks of the
accident, investigators had sharply
focused their attention on a failure in
Challenger's right solid rocket
booster, but Rogers declared that he
was also convinced that the space
agency's launch process had been
fundamentally "flawed" in the Chal
lenger case.
Young appeared to agree in
directly, telling the commission, "I
have the feeling that the veiy biggest
problem that must be solved before
the space shuttle flies again is com
munication."
