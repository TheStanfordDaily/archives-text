Mayors discuss homeless
WASHINGTON — A bureaucratic maze
prevents thousands of homeless people across the
nation from getting basic needed benefits such as
food stamps and general welfare assistance, the
U.S. Conference pf Mayors said yesterday.
In meetings with officials in a number of cities,
staff members of the mayors group have been
told of many "Catch-225" that make it
impossible for some homeless people to get such
benefits.
"The kind of help that might give regular sup
port for these people seems to be hard to get,"
Laura Waxman, assistant executive director of
the conference, said.
For example, in Connecticut, homeless men
tally ill people who cannot work must have a doc
tor's statement saying they are disabled in order
to get welfare.
A similar provision in Los Angeles County re
quires that people who are declared
"unemployable ' prove it before they are granted
general relief money.
And nationwide, the Department of
Agriculture's food stamp program does not allow
a person to receive stamps if he lives in a shelter
that provides two meals a day.
Jo-Ann Eccher, director of a hunger hotline at
Project Bread in Boston, said the rule is unfair
because shelter meals often are not nutritious.
The mayors group is gathering the information
as part of a nationwide project designed to make
it easier for its 878 member cities to cope with
the problems of the homeless. The $150,000 ef
fort is being funded by the National Institute of
Mental Health.

Artificial virus protested
WASHINGTON — Armed with a General
Accounting Office report criticizing the Depart
ment of Agriculture for its handling of genetically
engineered experiments, environmentalists yes
terday called on the department to revoke a
license it granted recently to market the first ge
netically engineered virus to vaccinate hogs
against a deadly disease, pseudorabies.
The GAO report, issued Wednesday night,
said the department's oversight of the controver
sial tests "has lacked authority and direction."
The department "has been hesitant in develop
ing a well-defined regulatory structure," partly
because it has been "influenced by the White
House's Office of Science and Technology
Policy," the report said. The Reagan Administra
tion has sought to avoid overregulation of com
panies in the relatively new industry.
The GAO report shows that the Agriculture
department's oversight of genetic engineering "is
a joke," said environmentalist Jeremy Rifkin,
who threatened to sue the government if the
virus license is not revoked within 10 days.
Rifkin, who has helped to block other genetic
engineering experiments, obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act a number of docu
ments about the virus experiments and said the
papers would become part of his court case.
Oil import tax weighed
WASHINGTON — A sharply divided Reagan
Administration is weighing a proposal to prop up
marginal oil producers in the United States by
doubling or tripling the 50-cent-a-barrel excise

tax on imported oil and using the proceeds to buy
domestic oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The proposal has generated some interest
among oil-state members of Congress and Ad
ministration officials concerned about the impact
of falling oil prices on the domestic industry. It is
unclear, however, how the tax increase would be
received at the White House, which has opposed
recent efforts to impose new fees on imported oil
and affirmed this week that it has no intention of
interfering with the world oil market.
Two months ago. President Reagan said he
might be willing to accept new taxes on oil im
ports as part of an effort to restructure the tax
code, but he withdrew that tentative support last
month, saying he was persuaded that the fee
"would have a bad effect on the economy."
Supporters of the idea defend the excise tax as
a "user fee" that would bolster the nation's
defenses against overreliance on imported oil.
But the argument has its skeptics, including high
level officials at the Energy Department who
have been casting about for ways to protect the
U.S. oil industry.
"What's the difference between an excise tax
and an import tax?" said a department spokes
man. "The position of top officials in this office is
that we would not favor such an approach."
Prices sharply lower
NEW YORK — The stock market took its
second sharp drop of the week yesterday, under a
barrage of selling attributed to program trading
involving index futures and individual stocks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
28.86 points to 1,766.40, only two days after it
took a 28.50-point tumble in Tuesday's session.
