Interns win union rights
SAN FRANCISCO — About 4,500 interns
and residents at University of California hospi
tals. who work up to 100 hours a week for
modest pay while continuing their medical train
ing, are employees with full union rights, the
state Supreme Court ruled yesterday.
By a 4-2 vote, the court rejected the univer
sity's argument that the so-called hospital
housestaff were primarily students, ruling that
their educational benefits could be considered
subordinate to the hospital work that occupies
more than three-fourths of their time.
The decision entitles the housestaff to decide
whether to choose a union to represent them in
negotiations with the university on wages and
working conditions.
University labor relations director James Phil
lips said the ruling was disappointing because
"we feel the primary purpose in involvement of
the housestaff is an educational endeavor."
But Dr. Barbara Akin of UC-Irvine. president
of the California Association of Interns and Resi
dents. said union rights for housestaff "can assure
fairness in compensation and benefits for each in
tern and resident, specify a fair process by which

grievances and disciplinary actions can be carried
out. and delineate standards of working condi
tions which are of direct relevance to patient
care."
Roadblocks under attack
SAN FRANCISCO — Throwing the legality
of police roadblocks for drunken driving into
question, the state Supreme Court said yesterday
it will hear an American Civil Liberties Union
appeal challenging the random stops of drivers.
Chief Justice Rose Bird and Justices Stanley
Mosk. Joseph Grodin. Allen Broussard and Cruz
Reynoso. one more than the needed majority on
the court, voted to review a lower-court ruling of
last December that upheld the year-old check
point program. Justices Malcolm Lucas and Ed
ward Panelli did not vote for a hearing. •
The action voids the appeals court decision and
makes the legality of the program an open ques
tion. The Supreme Court will schedule a hearing
and decide the issue at a later date.
The checkpoints, which are used mainly during
holiday periods, are regarded by many law en
forcement officials as one of the most effective

deterrents against drunken driving. But the
ACLU contends they are unauthorized by state
law and violate constitutional rules on searches
and seizures.
Lottery hits goal early

tery has pulled in more than $1.4 billion from
ticket sales and given out more than $650 million
in prizes, meeting its full-year sales goal in the

The state s public school system, from kinder
garten through college, received $476 million
during the six-month period beginning Oct. 3,
19X5, when lottery tickets first went on sale.

won by a Stockton sign painter, 44-year-old
Francisco Campos.
Today's weather
Today will be partially cloudy with highs in the

ocean. No jokes today, sorry.
