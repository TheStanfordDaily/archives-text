In violent confrontations with
hundreds of anti-apartheid demon
strators. squads of baton-wielding
police arrested 91 protesters on the
UC-Berkeley campus early yesterday
and destroyed a makeshift shan
tytown.
Twenty-nine people were injured
in the conflict, which began before
dawn when police moved to arrest
demonstrators who had built a shan
tytown on the steps of California
Hall, a Berkeley administration
building. The shantytown was the
second that demonstrators had er
rected on the Berkeley campus in
three days to protest the university's

investments in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa.
The first shantytown that demon
strators built was removed by police
Tuesday after Berkeley campus fire
marshall declared it a fire hazard.
Wednesday night authorities warned
protesters that the university consid
ered the new shanties a fire hazard as
well and would raze the structures if
they were not removed.
The shanties, made of plywood and
cloth, were nailed to the doors of Cal
ifornia Hall, blocking entrances and
exits to the building. The UC-
Berkeley administration offered to
help relocate the shantytown to a
"safer place."
Alameda County Superior Court
Judge Ramsay issued a restraining or

der prohibiting protesters from
making structures that could block
access to campus buildings or disrupt
university employees in their duties.
When protesters refused to ac
knowledge the official notices, arrests
were made
Tension mounted as police placed
dozens of demonstrators on buses to
transport them to Alameda County's
Santa Rita Jail. Hundreds of other
protesters — mostly UC students —
surrounded the buses to prevent them
from moving.
Violence erupted when police,
wearing riot gear, tore down make
shift barricades that students had built
and began forcibly clearing a path
