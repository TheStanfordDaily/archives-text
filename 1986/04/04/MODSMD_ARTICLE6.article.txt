# SOS for research assistance
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
F.ven though the quarter's just
begun, you're swamped with work.
You've put off working on your

Feature

honors project all year, and it's due
any day now, and none of the
campus libraries seem to contain
any information related to your
topic.
But don't run in front of a speed
ing Marguerite bus — Support for
On-line Searching (SOS) can save
you.
SOS is a program currently oper

ating in Stanford libraries that pro
vides funding to eligible Stanford
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents to defray the cost of com
puter literature searches.
"Students eligible for the SOS
program pay only $5 per search.
Pre-SOS searches cost students as
much as $35-$5 O.
What exactly does a computer
search entail, you wonder. Well.
Stanford's Computer Search Ser
vice (CSS) provides access to
numerous on-line systems, and
each of these systems contains files,
or databases, on a variety of sub
jects. Databases exist for almost
every subject area. In short, com
puter searching puts you in contact

with indeces — some duplicated
elsewhere in printed form, some
not.
For example, one system, con
taining more than 200 files, in
cludes an index of book reviews
and a "Who's Who'" listing. The
same system also contains numeri
cal and statistical databases not
found in printed form.
The advantage of an on-line
search is that it gives access to a
wide range of things in a short per
iod of time.
Sounds great, you think, but I
don't know anything about com
puters. Luckily, you don't have to.
Search analysts at the library help
with all aspects of the computer
search.
When you first start thinking about
a search, they'll tell you if informa
tion resources exist on your topic. A
search analyst does the actual
keyboard work of the search also,
while the student can stand by and
say, "Yes, that's what I want,'* or,
"Actually, I was looking for some
thing more along the line of. .
Senior Lucy Hung said she found
the CSS "very helpful."
Hung used the system for research
on her anthropology honors thesis on
the traditional Chinese healing sys
tem and how it integrates with the
American healing system.
The search "gave me a lot of refer
ences that it would have been very
time-consuming for me to find on my
own," Hung said.
Hung explained that she told a
search analyst about her thesis, and
the analyst thought of the key words
that would lead to the references she
wanted.
Graduate student Bill Evers used
CSS for a more specific purpose.
Evers' political science dissertation
deals with theories on the liberty of
the press, and he used the system to
look for references to Ernest Hock
ing, a political theorist in the 19405.
Unfortunately, Evers used the

Computer Search System pre-SOS
and had to pay the hill from the com
mercial on-line systems himself.
Now, those nightmarish costs for
students are no more.
David Langenberg, Data Services
Librarian at Green Library, recalled
the days when students had to pay
high prices for the service.
"We'd start discussing costs and
they (the students] (would) go away,"
he said.
Since "the library is always looking
for ways to make services more acces
sible to students," continued Langen
berg, the SOS program was
developed.
Now, eligible students can apply
for SOS by filling out a short applica
tion available at all of the Stanford li
braries. Three signatures are required
on the form.
The first signature is the student's
own, saying that there are no funds
from a research grant or other source
to pay for the research, that the stu
dent is not supported by a research
assistantship, and that the student will
complete a short questionnaire after
the search.
Second, a faculty member must
sign the application, stating that the
search topic is related to the student's
academic program and is for an
honors thesis, dissertation, master's
thesis or other comparable research.
Finally, a library search analyst
signs the application, certifying that
on-line information does exist for the
project.

When you first start thinking about
a search, they'll tell you if informa
tion resources exist on your topic. A
search analyst does the actual
keyboard work of the search also,
while the student can stand by and
say, "Yes, that's what I want,'* or,
"Actually, I was looking for some
thing more along the line of. .
Senior Lucy Hung said she found
the CSS "very helpful."
Hung used the system for research
on her anthropology honors thesis on
the traditional Chinese healing sys
tem and how it integrates with the
American healing system.
The search "gave me a lot of refer
ences that it would have been very
time-consuming for me to find on my
own," Hung said.
Hung explained that she told a
search analyst about her thesis, and
the analyst thought of the key words
that would lead to the references she
wanted.
Graduate student Bill Evers used
CSS for a more specific purpose.
Evers' political science dissertation
deals with theories on the liberty of
the press, and he used the system to
look for references to Ernest Hock
ing, a political theorist in the 19405.
Unfortunately, Evers used the

Computer Search System pre-SOS
and had to pay the hill from the com
mercial on-line systems himself.
Now, those nightmarish costs for
students are no more.
David Langenberg, Data Services
Librarian at Green Library, recalled
the days when students had to pay
high prices for the service.
"We'd start discussing costs and
they (the students] (would) go away,"
he said.
Since "the library is always looking
for ways to make services more acces
sible to students," continued Langen
berg, the SOS program was
developed.
Now, eligible students can apply
for SOS by filling out a short applica
tion available at all of the Stanford li
braries. Three signatures are required
on the form.
The first signature is the student's
own, saying that there are no funds
from a research grant or other source
to pay for the research, that the stu
dent is not supported by a research
assistantship, and that the student will
complete a short questionnaire after
the search.
Second, a faculty member must
sign the application, stating that the
search topic is related to the student's
academic program and is for an
honors thesis, dissertation, master's
thesis or other comparable research.
Finally, a library search analyst
signs the application, certifying that
on-line information does exist for the
project.
