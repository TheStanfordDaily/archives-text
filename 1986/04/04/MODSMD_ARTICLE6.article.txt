# SOS for research assistance

### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
F.ven though the quarter's just
begun, you're swamped with work.
You've put off working on your

Feature

honors project all year, and it's due
any day now, and none of the
campus libraries seem to contain
any information related to your
topic.
But don't run in front of a speed
ing Marguerite bus — Support for
On-line Searching (SOS) can save
you.
SOS is a program currently oper

ating in Stanford libraries that pro
vides funding to eligible Stanford
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents to defray the cost of com
puter literature searches.
"Students eligible for the SOS
program pay only $5 per search.
Pre-SOS searches cost students as
much as $35-$5 O.
What exactly does a computer
search entail, you wonder. Well.
Stanford's Computer Search Ser
vice (CSS) provides access to
numerous on-line systems, and
each of these systems contains files,
or databases, on a variety of sub
jects. Databases exist for almost
every subject area. In short, com
puter searching puts you in contact

with indeces — some duplicated
elsewhere in printed form, some
not.
For example, one system, con
taining more than 200 files, in
cludes an index of book reviews
and a "Who's Who'" listing. The
same system also contains numeri
cal and statistical databases not
found in printed form.
The advantage of an on-line
search is that it gives access to a
wide range of things in a short per
iod of time.
Sounds great, you think, but I
don't know anything about com
puters. Luckily, you don't have to.
