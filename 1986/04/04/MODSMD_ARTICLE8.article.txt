# Stanford got rowdy, too
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Warning: It has been determined that spring vacation
is hazardous to the health of U.S. college students
seeking respite from a winter's worth of academic pur
suits.
In light of last month's well-publicized student
"unrest" at posh resorts in California and Florida, this
warning label could well be attached to the airline tick
ets and hotel reservations of college students next year
when they head off for their spring vacations.
In places like Palm Springs and Ft. Lauderdale, a
spring break of fun and sun sometimes turned violent
this year. The streets of Palm Springs hosted a near
riot, with students attacking one another and throwing
rocks and bottles at police. Across the country in
Florida, a number of students fell to their deaths from
balconies of hotels where they were staying.
Some vacationing Stanford students found them
selves caught in the turmoil, including a plane load of
Hawaii-bound students who were detained by police
when they arrived in Honolulu.
According to freshman Jim Pitofsky, his Hawaiian
Air llight — part of a $349 vacation package organized
by Pasadena Travel — got off to a turbulent start when
some of approximately 200 students didn't sit in their
ticketed seats.
"It was madness because everyone sat where they
wanted," Pitofsky said.
Senior Neal Lintecum indicated that part of the
problem began before the plane even got in the air.
According to Lintecum, there was a delay in the dis

tribution of boarding passes at San Francisco Interna
tional Airport, during which some students began
drinking alcoholic beverages. The partying continued
after the students boarded the plane.
The problems began to mount once the students
were in the air, Lintecum said.
One student apparently threw a roll that struck a
stewardess, and another removed the life vest from his
seat. Lintecum said. Pitofsky added that at least one
student also pinched one of the stewardesses.
'"The implications of removing that life vest in the
event of an accident are pretty important," he said, al
though he added that most of the students' behavior
was relatively harmless.
"1 don't think the danger was such that it affected
the safety of the flight." Lintecum said.
The police officers who greeted the students when
the plane arrived in Hawaii, however, didn't drape leis
around their necks.
Lintecum said that students seated in approximately
20 rows of the plane were detained for a half hour
while the flight crew made "two or three" trips down
the aisle searching for coolers and life vests.
Police reprimanded the students for four specific
incidents, Lintecum said, including the open consump
tion of alcohol by those under the age of 21, accosting
a stewardess, throwing an object at a stewardess and
the missing life vest.
On board the returning flight to the mainland, the
students were accompanied by a federal marshal!, Lin
tecum said.
"It was the quietest flight," Pitofsky said.
