# Swimmers earn national crown
## 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS — In Hollywood,
writers are concocting a new movie script
these days, and it's patterned after the
highly successful "Rocky" series. But in
place of the Italian Stallion, it's the Stan
ford men's swim team that throws all the
hard punches and returns year after year
to defend its NCAA swimming title.
With the help of some hig-name stars

like former-Olympians Pablo Morales,
John Moffet and Jeff Kostoff, as well as a
fine supporting cast, Stanford demolished
all contenders this weekend to capture its
second straight NCAA title at the Indiana
University Natatorium in Indianapolis.
The producers feel confident of the
drama's box office success because it stars
some veteren big names like Pablo
Morales, John Moffet. Jeff Kostoff, and
Dave Lundberg. Also featured are some
hot, young talents like Sean Murphy, An

thony Mosse, Jay Mortenson, and John
Hodge. Along with them is a strong sup
porting cast including Mike Reynolds,
Dave Louden, Matt Nance, Bob Gavin,
Kurt Kroesche and Robert Gene.
Thor Johnson and Tom Rothenbucher
make special guest appearances.
But the cast is not complete without a
compassionate, hard driving coach. Skip

Junior Jeff Kostoff set a new U.S. record in the 1,650-yard freestyle this weekend in Indianapolis, helping the Stanford
men's swimming team to its second consecutive national championship.
and trainer Rick Eagleston.
The swimming industry is hyped.
The plot has all the suspense of the
"Rocky" series, and it's a bit more
exciting. Above all else, the story is
realistic. It goes something like this:
Half a point better than last year,
the Cardinal swimmers teamed up
and compiled a grand total of 404
points. Their closest competitor —
California — had to settle for 335
points, Texas followed with 325Vz,
Florida finished with 321 and UCLA
rounded out the top five teams with
288.
After emerging from the competi
tion pool which his swimmers threw
him into preceding the championship
award presentation, Stanford Coach
Skip Kenney said through a smile that
appeared a mile wide. "I'm so damn
proud of our guys. This one means
more than last year. There are so
many good teams and good swim
mers. The w hole intensity of the meet
made it better."
Then he leaped back into the water
to join the squad in several jubilant
rounds of the I.eland chant and gen
eral rowdiness.
Kenney was voted Coach of the
Year by the other NCAA
participating swim coaches. It was an
honor, like the team title, that he
captured for the second year in a row.
Moffet, a senior co-captain and re
turning NCAA champion, said of the
Cardinal's 1986 victory compared to
1985, "It was more fun this year. This
is the absolute best. The past four
years — I can't believe it's over. All
the hours spent training. It's worth
it."
Junior Dave Louden added, "1 was
able to enjoy it more this year be
cause it wasn't so desperate. Ifwas in
tense, but more fun."
Friday's swimming competition
tensed up the Stanford team in a
number of ways. Even though the
Cardinal totaled 255 points, 32
points ahead of Cal, the Bears came
on strong in the sprints, leaving Ken
ney and Knapp wishing for an even
more comfortable lead.
In the 400-yard individual medley
on Friday, U.S. and meet record
holder Kostoff lost his title to Ricardo
Prado of Southern Methodist Univer
sity. "1 kept thinking the speed would
come, but it didn't," Kostoff said.
"Kostoff was a little off," Knapp
said after Friday's races. "We win the
meet with our wins. When they're a
little off, it hurts us. We're counting
on Jeff in the mile tomorrow."
Kostoff was destined not to let
them down.
Freshmen John Hodge added his
two-cents worth to the Stanford pot
when he placed sixth in the 200 free

style (1:37.23). Louden contributed
consolation points with his 13th-pluce
finish.
In the 100 breaststroke. a good
swim by Moffet (53.90) was not good
enough. He lost his title to UCLA's
Giovanni Minervini by just .15 of a
second. "When you're on top for such
a long time, you can't be 100 percent
successful," Kenney said of Moffet's
second-place finish.
Stanford senior Dave Lundberg
placed eighth in that heat with a
55.18.
In the 100 backstroke, the weaker
of his two individual races, sopho
more Sean Murphy swam to fourth
place (49.36).
The highlights on Friday were the
preliminaries and finals of the 100
butterfly. Stanford placed three
swimmers in the finals of the 100 but
terfly, and they provided a significant
boost for the Cardinal's talley.
In the morning. New Zealander
Anthony Mosse hobbled to the
blocks despite a nagging ankle sprain
that he suffered in the beginning of
the week. " He tore some talofibular
ligaments in the outside of his ankle
that caused bleeding, swelling and
pain," Eagleston said.
But when the buzzer sounded,
Mosse exploded in top form and
rallied to a first place finish in his heat
with both a seasonal and personal
best time of 47.83. "With his ankle
like it is, he swam an exceptional
race," Eagleston said.
Mosse's performance sparked a
mood change in the rest of the team.
In the next heat, teammate
Morales outsprinted all others in his
field to coast to a new U.S. Open and
U.S. record time of 46.26. In the
finals that night, Morales captured
the 100 butterfly title for the third
year in a row and his second individ
ual victory of the meet.
"I wanted to be aggressive but con
trolled. I just wanted to swim well,"
he said.
"He came back and he got me
excited to swim as well as the whole
team," Morales said of Mosse. "He
was the turning point of the meet."
Mosse finished fifth overall.
Behind Morales, teammate Jay
Mortenson swam stunningly well and
touched in at 47.71, his personal best.
A freshman with no previous national
experience, Mortenson placed fourth.
"He's hot," Knapp said of Morten
son. "He's gonna be a star. That's
why we recruited him."
In Friday's final event, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford, with the
team of Hodge, Louden, Kostoff and
Morales, picked up more points with
a sixth place finish.
After a long day of surprises and
disappointments, Kenney said Friday
night, "This is so damn emotional."
The emotion shared by the close
knit Cardinal was evident in the way
teammates empathized with each

other in the face of pressure situa
tions. They were much more enthusi
astic than some opposing teams like
Texas and Florida. "We're more like
a family this year than ever before,"
Kenney said.
Stanford was shooting for some top
swims in the Saturday prelims to se
cure more protection for its NCAA
title, and the Cardinal came out
swinging. They had top finishes in all
their morning heats except for the
100 freestyle, in which Hodge
snagged a second, and the 1,650 free
style, where freshmen Robert Gene
and Gavin and Louden missed the
finals.
Then, the final evening in front of a
record crowd of 2,933, Kostoff ful
filled his premeditated destiny. He
led Stanford to its NCAA victory.
It seemed as if he had stored up the
two previous days' speed and used it
to fuel him in the distance 1,650 free

style. As the race got longer, Kos
toff s pace got quicker until he met
the wall. The clock stopped at
14:37.87, and he established a new
U.S. Open and U.S. record, breaking
his own mark set in 1984.
"I didn't get determined until this
morning," Kostoff said of the meet.
"It was my last event. I wasn't inter
ested in time. I just wanted to win."
His determination made all the dif
ference in the world.
Kostoff ran cross country this past
fall and said that the running "made
the 1,650 feel shorter. It's a different
kind of discipline."
The next win on the Stanford
agenda went to Murphy in the 200
backstroke. A returning champion
also. Murphy retained his status with
a 1:45.90. "I felt really confident," he
said. "I didn't think it could get any
better, and then it did."
Then the time came for Morales

and Mosse to do their job in the 200
butterfly. They teamed up to capture
37 points for Stanford with a one-two
finish. Morales touched before Mosse
to win his third individual NCAA title
and set a pool record of 1:43.05.
Mosse swam his personal best of
1:43.96.
The two teammates who al
ternately finished one-two through
out the season exchanged wet hugs in
the water after the race.
The last of the individual knock
outs occurred when Moffet let it go in
the 200 breaststroke to snare his third
consecutive title in that event with a
pool record time of 1:56.91. "The
100 breaststroke was a little disap
pointing yesterday," Moffet said, "so
I was really glad to salvage a win."
Stanford scored a total of 140
swimming points Saturday, comple
mented by 10 diving points.

Junior Jeff Kostoff set a new U.S. record in the 1,650-yard freestyle this weekend in Indianapolis, helping the Stanford
men's swimming team to its second consecutive national championship.
and trainer Rick Eagleston.
The swimming industry is hyped.
The plot has all the suspense of the
"Rocky" series, and it's a bit more
exciting. Above all else, the story is
realistic. It goes something like this:
Half a point better than last year,
the Cardinal swimmers teamed up
and compiled a grand total of 404
points. Their closest competitor —
California — had to settle for 335
points, Texas followed with 325Vz,
Florida finished with 321 and UCLA
rounded out the top five teams with
288.
After emerging from the competi
tion pool which his swimmers threw
him into preceding the championship
award presentation, Stanford Coach
Skip Kenney said through a smile that
appeared a mile wide. "I'm so damn
proud of our guys. This one means
more than last year. There are so
many good teams and good swim
mers. The w hole intensity of the meet
made it better."
Then he leaped back into the water
to join the squad in several jubilant
rounds of the I.eland chant and gen
eral rowdiness.
Kenney was voted Coach of the
Year by the other NCAA
participating swim coaches. It was an
honor, like the team title, that he
captured for the second year in a row.
Moffet, a senior co-captain and re
turning NCAA champion, said of the
Cardinal's 1986 victory compared to
1985, "It was more fun this year. This
is the absolute best. The past four
years — I can't believe it's over. All
the hours spent training. It's worth
it."
Junior Dave Louden added, "1 was
able to enjoy it more this year be
cause it wasn't so desperate. Ifwas in
tense, but more fun."
Friday's swimming competition
tensed up the Stanford team in a
number of ways. Even though the
Cardinal totaled 255 points, 32
points ahead of Cal, the Bears came
on strong in the sprints, leaving Ken
ney and Knapp wishing for an even
more comfortable lead.
In the 400-yard individual medley
on Friday, U.S. and meet record
holder Kostoff lost his title to Ricardo
Prado of Southern Methodist Univer
sity. "1 kept thinking the speed would
come, but it didn't," Kostoff said.
"Kostoff was a little off," Knapp
said after Friday's races. "We win the
meet with our wins. When they're a
little off, it hurts us. We're counting
on Jeff in the mile tomorrow."
Kostoff was destined not to let
them down.
Freshmen John Hodge added his
two-cents worth to the Stanford pot
when he placed sixth in the 200 free

style (1:37.23). Louden contributed
consolation points with his 13th-pluce
finish.
In the 100 breaststroke. a good
swim by Moffet (53.90) was not good
enough. He lost his title to UCLA's
Giovanni Minervini by just .15 of a
second. "When you're on top for such
a long time, you can't be 100 percent
successful," Kenney said of Moffet's
second-place finish.
Stanford senior Dave Lundberg
placed eighth in that heat with a
55.18.
In the 100 backstroke, the weaker
of his two individual races, sopho
more Sean Murphy swam to fourth
place (49.36).
The highlights on Friday were the
preliminaries and finals of the 100
butterfly. Stanford placed three
swimmers in the finals of the 100 but
terfly, and they provided a significant
boost for the Cardinal's talley.
In the morning. New Zealander
Anthony Mosse hobbled to the
blocks despite a nagging ankle sprain
that he suffered in the beginning of
the week. " He tore some talofibular
ligaments in the outside of his ankle
that caused bleeding, swelling and
pain," Eagleston said.
But when the buzzer sounded,
Mosse exploded in top form and
rallied to a first place finish in his heat
with both a seasonal and personal
best time of 47.83. "With his ankle
like it is, he swam an exceptional
race," Eagleston said.
Mosse's performance sparked a
mood change in the rest of the team.
In the next heat, teammate
Morales outsprinted all others in his
field to coast to a new U.S. Open and
U.S. record time of 46.26. In the
finals that night, Morales captured
the 100 butterfly title for the third
year in a row and his second individ
ual victory of the meet.
"I wanted to be aggressive but con
trolled. I just wanted to swim well,"
he said.
"He came back and he got me
excited to swim as well as the whole
team," Morales said of Mosse. "He
was the turning point of the meet."
Mosse finished fifth overall.
Behind Morales, teammate Jay
Mortenson swam stunningly well and
touched in at 47.71, his personal best.
A freshman with no previous national
experience, Mortenson placed fourth.
"He's hot," Knapp said of Morten
son. "He's gonna be a star. That's
why we recruited him."
In Friday's final event, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford, with the
team of Hodge, Louden, Kostoff and
Morales, picked up more points with
a sixth place finish.
After a long day of surprises and
disappointments, Kenney said Friday
night, "This is so damn emotional."
The emotion shared by the close
knit Cardinal was evident in the way
teammates empathized with each

other in the face of pressure situa
tions. They were much more enthusi
astic than some opposing teams like
Texas and Florida. "We're more like
a family this year than ever before,"
Kenney said.
Stanford was shooting for some top
swims in the Saturday prelims to se
cure more protection for its NCAA
title, and the Cardinal came out
swinging. They had top finishes in all
their morning heats except for the
100 freestyle, in which Hodge
snagged a second, and the 1,650 free
style, where freshmen Robert Gene
and Gavin and Louden missed the
finals.
Then, the final evening in front of a
record crowd of 2,933, Kostoff ful
filled his premeditated destiny. He
led Stanford to its NCAA victory.
It seemed as if he had stored up the
two previous days' speed and used it
to fuel him in the distance 1,650 free

style. As the race got longer, Kos
toff s pace got quicker until he met
the wall. The clock stopped at
14:37.87, and he established a new
U.S. Open and U.S. record, breaking
his own mark set in 1984.
"I didn't get determined until this
morning," Kostoff said of the meet.
"It was my last event. I wasn't inter
ested in time. I just wanted to win."
His determination made all the dif
ference in the world.
Kostoff ran cross country this past
fall and said that the running "made
the 1,650 feel shorter. It's a different
kind of discipline."
The next win on the Stanford
agenda went to Murphy in the 200
backstroke. A returning champion
also. Murphy retained his status with
a 1:45.90. "I felt really confident," he
said. "I didn't think it could get any
better, and then it did."
Then the time came for Morales

and Mosse to do their job in the 200
butterfly. They teamed up to capture
37 points for Stanford with a one-two
finish. Morales touched before Mosse
to win his third individual NCAA title
and set a pool record of 1:43.05.
Mosse swam his personal best of
1:43.96.
The two teammates who al
ternately finished one-two through
out the season exchanged wet hugs in
the water after the race.
The last of the individual knock
outs occurred when Moffet let it go in
the 200 breaststroke to snare his third
consecutive title in that event with a
pool record time of 1:56.91. "The
100 breaststroke was a little disap
pointing yesterday," Moffet said, "so
I was really glad to salvage a win."
Stanford scored a total of 140
swimming points Saturday, comple
mented by 10 diving points.

The plot has all the suspense of the
"Rocky" series, and it's a bit more
exciting. Above all else, the story is
realistic. It goes something like this:
Half a point better than last year,
the Cardinal swimmers teamed up
and compiled a grand total of 404
points. Their closest competitor —
California — had to settle for 335
points, Texas followed with 325Vz,
Florida finished with 321 and UCLA
rounded out the top five teams with
288.
After emerging from the competi
tion pool which his swimmers threw
him into preceding the championship
award presentation, Stanford Coach
Skip Kenney said through a smile that
appeared a mile wide. "I'm so damn
proud of our guys. This one means
more than last year. There are so
many good teams and good swim
mers. The w hole intensity of the meet
made it better."
Then he leaped back into the water
to join the squad in several jubilant
rounds of the I.eland chant and gen
eral rowdiness.
Kenney was voted Coach of the
Year by the other NCAA
participating swim coaches. It was an
honor, like the team title, that he
captured for the second year in a row.
Moffet, a senior co-captain and re
turning NCAA champion, said of the
Cardinal's 1986 victory compared to
1985, "It was more fun this year. This
is the absolute best. The past four
years — I can't believe it's over. All
the hours spent training. It's worth
it."
Junior Dave Louden added, "1 was
able to enjoy it more this year be
cause it wasn't so desperate. Ifwas in
tense, but more fun."
Friday's swimming competition
tensed up the Stanford team in a
number of ways. Even though the
Cardinal totaled 255 points, 32
points ahead of Cal, the Bears came
on strong in the sprints, leaving Ken
ney and Knapp wishing for an even
more comfortable lead.
In the 400-yard individual medley
on Friday, U.S. and meet record
holder Kostoff lost his title to Ricardo
Prado of Southern Methodist Univer
sity. "1 kept thinking the speed would
come, but it didn't," Kostoff said.
"Kostoff was a little off," Knapp
said after Friday's races. "We win the
meet with our wins. When they're a
little off, it hurts us. We're counting
on Jeff in the mile tomorrow."
Kostoff was destined not to let
them down.
Freshmen John Hodge added his
two-cents worth to the Stanford pot
when he placed sixth in the 200 free

style (1:37.23). Louden contributed
consolation points with his 13th-pluce
finish.
In the 100 breaststroke. a good
swim by Moffet (53.90) was not good
enough. He lost his title to UCLA's
Giovanni Minervini by just .15 of a
second. "When you're on top for such
a long time, you can't be 100 percent
successful," Kenney said of Moffet's
second-place finish.
Stanford senior Dave Lundberg
placed eighth in that heat with a
55.18.
In the 100 backstroke, the weaker
of his two individual races, sopho
more Sean Murphy swam to fourth
place (49.36).
The highlights on Friday were the
preliminaries and finals of the 100
butterfly. Stanford placed three
swimmers in the finals of the 100 but
terfly, and they provided a significant
boost for the Cardinal's talley.
In the morning. New Zealander
Anthony Mosse hobbled to the
blocks despite a nagging ankle sprain
that he suffered in the beginning of
the week. " He tore some talofibular
ligaments in the outside of his ankle
that caused bleeding, swelling and
pain," Eagleston said.
But when the buzzer sounded,
Mosse exploded in top form and
rallied to a first place finish in his heat
with both a seasonal and personal
best time of 47.83. "With his ankle
like it is, he swam an exceptional
race," Eagleston said.
Mosse's performance sparked a
mood change in the rest of the team.
In the next heat, teammate
Morales outsprinted all others in his
field to coast to a new U.S. Open and
U.S. record time of 46.26. In the
finals that night, Morales captured
the 100 butterfly title for the third
year in a row and his second individ
ual victory of the meet.
"I wanted to be aggressive but con
trolled. I just wanted to swim well,"
he said.
"He came back and he got me
excited to swim as well as the whole
team," Morales said of Mosse. "He
was the turning point of the meet."
Mosse finished fifth overall.
Behind Morales, teammate Jay
Mortenson swam stunningly well and
touched in at 47.71, his personal best.
A freshman with no previous national
experience, Mortenson placed fourth.
"He's hot," Knapp said of Morten
son. "He's gonna be a star. That's
why we recruited him."
In Friday's final event, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford, with the
team of Hodge, Louden, Kostoff and
Morales, picked up more points with
a sixth place finish.
After a long day of surprises and
disappointments, Kenney said Friday
night, "This is so damn emotional."
The emotion shared by the close
knit Cardinal was evident in the way
teammates empathized with each

other in the face of pressure situa
tions. They were much more enthusi
astic than some opposing teams like
Texas and Florida. "We're more like
a family this year than ever before,"
Kenney said.
Stanford was shooting for some top
swims in the Saturday prelims to se
cure more protection for its NCAA
title, and the Cardinal came out
swinging. They had top finishes in all
their morning heats except for the
100 freestyle, in which Hodge
snagged a second, and the 1,650 free
style, where freshmen Robert Gene
and Gavin and Louden missed the
finals.
Then, the final evening in front of a
record crowd of 2,933, Kostoff ful
filled his premeditated destiny. He
led Stanford to its NCAA victory.
It seemed as if he had stored up the
two previous days' speed and used it
to fuel him in the distance 1,650 free

style. As the race got longer, Kos
toff s pace got quicker until he met
the wall. The clock stopped at
14:37.87, and he established a new
U.S. Open and U.S. record, breaking
his own mark set in 1984.
"I didn't get determined until this
morning," Kostoff said of the meet.
"It was my last event. I wasn't inter
ested in time. I just wanted to win."
His determination made all the dif
ference in the world.
Kostoff ran cross country this past
fall and said that the running "made
the 1,650 feel shorter. It's a different
kind of discipline."
The next win on the Stanford
agenda went to Murphy in the 200
backstroke. A returning champion
also. Murphy retained his status with
a 1:45.90. "I felt really confident," he
said. "I didn't think it could get any
better, and then it did."
Then the time came for Morales

and Mosse to do their job in the 200
butterfly. They teamed up to capture
37 points for Stanford with a one-two
finish. Morales touched before Mosse
to win his third individual NCAA title
and set a pool record of 1:43.05.
Mosse swam his personal best of
1:43.96.
The two teammates who al
ternately finished one-two through
out the season exchanged wet hugs in
the water after the race.
The last of the individual knock
outs occurred when Moffet let it go in
the 200 breaststroke to snare his third
consecutive title in that event with a
pool record time of 1:56.91. "The
100 breaststroke was a little disap
pointing yesterday," Moffet said, "so
I was really glad to salvage a win."
Stanford scored a total of 140
swimming points Saturday, comple
mented by 10 diving points.

Sean Murphy backstroked his way to a championship in the 200 and a fourth place finish in the 100 at the
NCAA championships in Indianapolis.
INDIANAPOLIS — In Hollywood,
writers are concocting a new movie script
these days, and it's patterned after the
highly successful "Rocky" series. But in
place of the Italian Stallion, it's the Stan
ford men's swim team that throws all the
hard punches and returns year after year
to defend its NCAA swimming title.
With the help of some hig-name stars

like former-Olympians Pablo Morales,
John Moffet and Jeff Kostoff, as well as a
fine supporting cast, Stanford demolished
all contenders this weekend to capture its
second straight NCAA title at the Indiana
University Natatorium in Indianapolis.
The producers feel confident of the
drama's box office success because it stars
some veteren big names like Pablo
Morales, John Moffet. Jeff Kostoff, and
Dave Lundberg. Also featured are some
hot, young talents like Sean Murphy, An

thony Mosse, Jay Mortenson, and John
Hodge. Along with them is a strong sup
porting cast including Mike Reynolds,
Dave Louden, Matt Nance, Bob Gavin,
Kurt Kroesche and Robert Gene.
Thor Johnson and Tom Rothenbucher
make special guest appearances.
But the cast is not complete without a
compassionate, hard driving coach. Skip
