INDIANAPOLIS â€” In Hollywood,
writers are concocting a new movie script
these days, and it's patterned after the
highly successful "Rocky" series. But in
place of the Italian Stallion, it's the Stan
ford men's swim team that throws all the
hard punches and returns year after year
to defend its NCAA swimming title.
With the help of some hig-name stars

like former-Olympians Pablo Morales,
John Moffet and Jeff Kostoff, as well as a
fine supporting cast, Stanford demolished
all contenders this weekend to capture its
second straight NCAA title at the Indiana
University Natatorium in Indianapolis.
The producers feel confident of the
drama's box office success because it stars
some veteren big names like Pablo
Morales, John Moffet. Jeff Kostoff, and
Dave Lundberg. Also featured are some
hot, young talents like Sean Murphy, An

thony Mosse, Jay Mortenson, and John
Hodge. Along with them is a strong sup
porting cast including Mike Reynolds,
Dave Louden, Matt Nance, Bob Gavin,
Kurt Kroesche and Robert Gene.
Thor Johnson and Tom Rothenbucher
make special guest appearances.
But the cast is not complete without a
compassionate, hard driving coach. Skip
