# DOE, universities compromise on classified work

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
/ j e, ? artment °* Ener gy, which drew fire from
Stanford officials last fall after proposing a controversial
change in DOE research policy, has reached a solution ac
ceptable to both sides.
The new policy, which states that the DOE may require
universities to accept classified work in any "future" con
tract, marks a toned-down version of the hotly contested
August 19X5 proposal, which might have forced Stanford
and all other DOE contractors to conduct classified work
within existing contracts.
Nearly all major American research universities banned
classified research in the 19705, a legacy of the Vietnam
War. Stanford has prohibited all classified research on
campus since 1970.
University officials here say they are satisfied with the
new DOE policy because it does not pose an immediate
threat to University restrictions on classified research. But
it remains unclear what ramifications the policy may have
on DOE-contracted research at Stanford in upcoming
years.
At issue is the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, a
government-owned, University-operated facility used for
the study of elementary particle physics. SLAC operates
under a single contract with the DOE, conducting unclas
sified expeiimental and theoretical scientific research at
Stanford. In the university's fiscal year 19X5, DOE fund
ing of SLAC topped $134 million.
Although the work conducted at SLAC is basic re
search aimed at discovery of fundamental properties of
matter and energy, there is always a possibility for practi
cal applications of those discoveries. The government
would like the option to classify work with potential appli
cations that it deems essential to national security. Stan
ford officials see the DOE classification option as a direct
threat to academic freedom.
The Stanford-DOE debate last fall, which centered
around the SLAC contract, pointed out the discrepancy in
the government's and University's desires. University
President Donald Kennedy denounced the original pro

posal in a letter to the DOE.
"The Department of Energy." he wrote, "ought not,
with the mere stroke of the pen, attempt to negate funda
mental academic policies dealing with openness in re
search. Such a requirement would prevent universities
such as Stanford, whose Linear Accelerator Center is one
of the leading high-energy physics laboratories of the
world, from continuing to contribute to this nation's scien
tific leadership."
Whether or not Stanford will win the long-term war
over retaining openness in SLAC research remains to be
seen, but the battle of 19X5 seems to have ended on terms
favorable to the University.
"I do not see any problems in the forseeable future,"
said SLAC Director Burton Richter, explaining that the
new DOE policy will affect only "major new facilities."
"We are a present facility," said Sidney Drell, deputy
director of SLAC. "The policy will not force us to do clas
sified work."
Earl Cilley, director of Stanford's Sponsored Projects
Office, which approves all University contracts, said he
had received assurances from DOE officials that " they see
no need at the present time to classify."
Cilley said the University will probably begin negotia
tions this fall to renew the current DOE-SI. AC contract, a
five-year agreement that expires in September 19X7. He
noted that DOE officials had told him three times that
they see no need to impose classification requirements on
SLAC in the new contract.
Toni Joseph, director of field operations management
in the DOE's Office of Energy Research, said the new
policy was the result of extensive negotiations both within
the DOE and with government contractors. The policy
should not cause problems, she said.
"We want to have facilities available to conduct classi
fied research," Joseph said. She offered a slightly different
interpretation than Richter of the new DOE research
policy, explaining that it pertained not only to contracts
for new facilities but also to contract renewals for existing
facilities.

"Of course, on any new DOE major facility, the depart
ment would ensure the possibility of classified research
being conducted there," she said. Contract renewals, she
added, might be subject to classification requirements as
well, if the contractor agrees to the terms. " Renewals w ill
be negotiated on a case-by-case basis."
Joseph said she lacked information to discuss the up
coming renewal of SLAC's contract.
It is unclear whether a new facility at SLAC might fall
into the DOE category of "major new facility" and thus
be available for classified research. According to Richter
and Drell, SLAC currently has no plans to build a facility
of this nature. Thus, there is currently no threat to the
University's open research policy.
Yet if SLAC does build a new facility, Stanford's policy
may be compromised. Joseph said a large new facility at
SLAC, financed by the DOE, would "most likely' require
a new contract that allowed for classification.
Joseph discussed the government's possible "need" to
conduct classified work at facilities that currently prohibit
it.
"In the future, if there is a compelling national need to
use a specialized facility for classified research, we would
ensure that the correct contractual provisions were drawn
up." she said. "If we wanted to use SLAC, we would
negotiate with the contractor to permit that experiment to
come about."
Asked how the DOE would react to a probable Stan
ford refusal to accept classified work, Joseph said, "I
would assume that some kind of compromise could be
worked out. Accommodations would be made that would
be acceptable to all parties."
Joseph added that if SLAC were required to accept
classified work, Stanford scientists would not be forced to
conduct that research. "It could be people from outside,"
she said.
SLAC currently allows no classified research, regard
less of who conducts it.
The DOE's aims are, if not likable, at least understand
able to Cilley, who is the University's chief liasion with the

DOE. Attempts to classify research, which usually come
in the form of DOE restrictions on publication of research
results, are clearly in the interest of the government, he
said.
"The DOE has no evil intent." Cilley said. "It's
reasonable for them to ask to review findings prior to
publication. They want to have that privilege just to be on
the safe side. We don't want that to be done just to be on
the safe side. We want them to have to show good rea
son."
Cilley said it is essential to maintain the open atmos
phere of a university in order to retain the best scientists
and the best scholarly work. "Secrecy tends to inhibit that
kind ot thing. - ' he said, noting also that classification
problems could jeopardize graduate students, who need
to publish their dissertations.
"We re strongly opposed to any type of censorship." he
said. "We re trying to protect the special open environ
ment ot an American research university."
Richter and Drell also emphasize the importance of
protecting openness and exchange of ideas at universities.
"Too much secrecy hurts science." Drell said.
One reason some academics cite for prohibiting classi
fied research here is the basic nature of the work done at
SI. AC. Some scientists teel that there is almost no chance
that SI-AC research will lead to discoveries that must be
classified to protect national security.
"What we re working on — high-energy physics — has
applications that are 50 years away." said Richard Taylor,
associate director of SI. AC for research.
Drell argues that basic research can lead anywhere,
even to discoveries that have military applications the
government deems top secret.
"Basic research is an exploration," he said. "What
we're doing is necessary for finding out what the world is
made 01. If we don't do it, we lose our ability to ask inter
esting questions. . . .
"But there is always the possibility that someone might
find a specific use for one of our basic research dis
coveries. Did Maxwell know that his work on electromag
netism would lead to radio and I V? Did Einstein know
where (his discovery of) relativity was leading the world?"

Although the work conducted at SLAC is basic re
search aimed at discovery of fundamental properties of
matter and energy, there is always a possibility for practi
cal applications of those discoveries. The government
would like the option to classify work with potential appli
cations that it deems essential to national security. Stan
ford officials see the DOE classification option as a direct
threat to academic freedom.
The Stanford-DOE debate last fall, which centered
around the SLAC contract, pointed out the discrepancy in
the government's and University's desires. University
President Donald Kennedy denounced the original pro

posal in a letter to the DOE.
"The Department of Energy." he wrote, "ought not,
with the mere stroke of the pen, attempt to negate funda
mental academic policies dealing with openness in re
search. Such a requirement would prevent universities
such as Stanford, whose Linear Accelerator Center is one
of the leading high-energy physics laboratories of the
world, from continuing to contribute to this nation's scien
tific leadership."
Whether or not Stanford will win the long-term war
over retaining openness in SLAC research remains to be
seen, but the battle of 19X5 seems to have ended on terms
favorable to the University.
"I do not see any problems in the forseeable future,"
said SLAC Director Burton Richter, explaining that the
new DOE policy will affect only "major new facilities."
"We are a present facility," said Sidney Drell, deputy
director of SLAC. "The policy will not force us to do clas
sified work."
Earl Cilley, director of Stanford's Sponsored Projects
Office, which approves all University contracts, said he
had received assurances from DOE officials that " they see
no need at the present time to classify."
Cilley said the University will probably begin negotia
tions this fall to renew the current DOE-SI. AC contract, a
five-year agreement that expires in September 19X7. He
noted that DOE officials had told him three times that
they see no need to impose classification requirements on
SLAC in the new contract.
Toni Joseph, director of field operations management
in the DOE's Office of Energy Research, said the new
policy was the result of extensive negotiations both within
the DOE and with government contractors. The policy
should not cause problems, she said.
"We want to have facilities available to conduct classi
fied research," Joseph said. She offered a slightly different
interpretation than Richter of the new DOE research
policy, explaining that it pertained not only to contracts
for new facilities but also to contract renewals for existing
facilities.

"Of course, on any new DOE major facility, the depart
ment would ensure the possibility of classified research
being conducted there," she said. Contract renewals, she
added, might be subject to classification requirements as
well, if the contractor agrees to the terms. " Renewals w ill
be negotiated on a case-by-case basis."
Joseph said she lacked information to discuss the up
coming renewal of SLAC's contract.
It is unclear whether a new facility at SLAC might fall
into the DOE category of "major new facility" and thus
be available for classified research. According to Richter
and Drell, SLAC currently has no plans to build a facility
of this nature. Thus, there is currently no threat to the
University's open research policy.
Yet if SLAC does build a new facility, Stanford's policy
may be compromised. Joseph said a large new facility at
SLAC, financed by the DOE, would "most likely' require
a new contract that allowed for classification.
Joseph discussed the government's possible "need" to
conduct classified work at facilities that currently prohibit
it.
"In the future, if there is a compelling national need to
use a specialized facility for classified research, we would
ensure that the correct contractual provisions were drawn
up." she said. "If we wanted to use SLAC, we would
negotiate with the contractor to permit that experiment to
come about."
Asked how the DOE would react to a probable Stan
ford refusal to accept classified work, Joseph said, "I
would assume that some kind of compromise could be
worked out. Accommodations would be made that would
be acceptable to all parties."
Joseph added that if SLAC were required to accept
classified work, Stanford scientists would not be forced to
conduct that research. "It could be people from outside,"
she said.
SLAC currently allows no classified research, regard
less of who conducts it.
The DOE's aims are, if not likable, at least understand
able to Cilley, who is the University's chief liasion with the

DOE. Attempts to classify research, which usually come
in the form of DOE restrictions on publication of research
results, are clearly in the interest of the government, he
said.
"The DOE has no evil intent." Cilley said. "It's
reasonable for them to ask to review findings prior to
publication. They want to have that privilege just to be on
the safe side. We don't want that to be done just to be on
the safe side. We want them to have to show good rea
son."
Cilley said it is essential to maintain the open atmos
phere of a university in order to retain the best scientists
and the best scholarly work. "Secrecy tends to inhibit that
kind ot thing. - ' he said, noting also that classification
problems could jeopardize graduate students, who need
to publish their dissertations.
"We re strongly opposed to any type of censorship." he
said. "We re trying to protect the special open environ
ment ot an American research university."
Richter and Drell also emphasize the importance of
protecting openness and exchange of ideas at universities.
"Too much secrecy hurts science." Drell said.
One reason some academics cite for prohibiting classi
fied research here is the basic nature of the work done at
SI. AC. Some scientists teel that there is almost no chance
that SI-AC research will lead to discoveries that must be
classified to protect national security.
"What we re working on — high-energy physics — has
applications that are 50 years away." said Richard Taylor,
associate director of SI. AC for research.
Drell argues that basic research can lead anywhere,
even to discoveries that have military applications the
government deems top secret.
"Basic research is an exploration," he said. "What
we're doing is necessary for finding out what the world is
made 01. If we don't do it, we lose our ability to ask inter
esting questions. . . .
"But there is always the possibility that someone might
find a specific use for one of our basic research dis
coveries. Did Maxwell know that his work on electromag
netism would lead to radio and I V? Did Einstein know
where (his discovery of) relativity was leading the world?"
/ j e, ? artment °* Ener gy, which drew fire from
Stanford officials last fall after proposing a controversial
change in DOE research policy, has reached a solution ac
ceptable to both sides.
The new policy, which states that the DOE may require
universities to accept classified work in any "future" con
tract, marks a toned-down version of the hotly contested
August 19X5 proposal, which might have forced Stanford
and all other DOE contractors to conduct classified work
within existing contracts.
Nearly all major American research universities banned
classified research in the 19705, a legacy of the Vietnam
War. Stanford has prohibited all classified research on
campus since 1970.
University officials here say they are satisfied with the
new DOE policy because it does not pose an immediate
threat to University restrictions on classified research. But
it remains unclear what ramifications the policy may have
on DOE-contracted research at Stanford in upcoming
years.
At issue is the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, a
government-owned, University-operated facility used for
the study of elementary particle physics. SLAC operates
under a single contract with the DOE, conducting unclas
sified expeiimental and theoretical scientific research at
Stanford. In the university's fiscal year 19X5, DOE fund
ing of SLAC topped $134 million.
