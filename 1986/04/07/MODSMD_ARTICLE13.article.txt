Firing was unjust
Last October I was accused of
damaging another employee's car, in
spite of an eyewitness testifying to the
contrary. Not surprisingly, I (and the
eyewitness) was fired. Although there
has been some media attention to this
case, this is my first occasion to state
my case in writing.
In his signed statement of accusa
tion, Hector Allen, owner of the car,
states that when he saw me leaving
the vicinity of where his car was
parked, he asked me to stop, which I
did. He went to his vehicle, saw that it
had been damaged and asked what 1
had done to it. I replied that I had not
touched his car. That I was wide open
in that area, and that I immediately
returned to that area when he called,
is not the behavior of a person that
had committed a crime.
In Felix Barthelemy's termination
letter to me of Oct. 16, he said that
"we" have concluded that I was in
volved in damaging Allen's car. Who
is "we"? Simply because my tes
timony is different from the accuser's
does not make me guilty of the
charges. When there are disputes in
testimonies, does not the burden fall
on the accuser? In light of my 11

years of satisfactory employment at
Stanford, in light of the fact that Al
len had not seen anyone, let alone
me. damage his car, was not termina
tion excessive — at least until a thor
ough investigation or arbitration had
been completed?
In Barthelemy's letter to me, he
claims that there are several inconsis
tencies in my statement and the state
ment of the eyewitness. Shouldn't I
be told what these inconsistencies
were? Shouldn't 1 have been able to
respond to what they were alleged to
be? Shouldn't 1 have been able to
question Allen before the "we" drew
their conclusion to fire me? If the
"we" had felt confident about their
conclusion, wouldn't they have said
so at the trial by the Palo Alto
Municipal court? Instead, not one of
the "we" appeared at the proceed
ings, leaving the court to dismiss the
case.
My conclusion is that the "we," as
did the court, found there was not
evidence to support the accusation
against me. Nevertheless, the Univer
sity's "we" did not deem it fair to
reinstate me.
This case is additional evidence
that the University's Employee Rela
tions Office, under Barthelemy's
leadership and with the concurrence

of the University's Legal Counseling
Office, is deeply involved in dishonest
and improper personnel policies. 1
should be reinstated, retroactively,
and Barthelemy should be rebuked.

Kappas' GPA is
no joking matter
The Daily made a small (but signif
icant) error in the April Fools issue
(Daily, April 1). One of the
"fabricated" titles read "Applause
Applause: Stanford Kappas earn
praise from National Chapter for
achieving highest cumulative G.P.A."
Although the reference is somewhat
ambiguous — there are several
campus groups referred to as Kappas
— I would like to make a clarification
in support of Kappa Kappa Gamma
Sorority. The Beta Eta Deuteron
Chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma
(Stanford) has indeed been
recognized nationally for having the
highest GPA of all chapters in the
country. The sorority has maintained
this recognition every year since its
reinstatement in 1978.
