# Black America catch-22
## 
### 
In every political season there emerges a hot, "new"
issue — some matter which raises consciousness, sparks
thunderous debate, and, as quickly as it appears, gets filed
away unsolved. We may already be approaching the latter
stages in one such issue: the plight of the black American
"underclass," a plight belatedly brought to the attention
of the public and the media by a recent CBS documentary,
"The Vanishing Family — Crisis in Black America." The
black underclass, comprising some 20 percent of the
American black population and including almost 3.5 mil
lion human beings, is generally characterized by rampant
teenage pregnancy, a high rate of illegitimate births, a
high frequency of single-parent families, high unemploy
ment, high crime rates and chronic poverty. Isolated from
mainstream America, their lives might well be described
by Thomas Hobbes' vision of man's life prior to the ad
vent of government — "poor, nasty, brutish and short."

Modern-day conservatives, of course, reject the notion
that government can do much to alleviate the woes of the
black underclass. Many of them have reacted to the CBS
documentary with something not unlike smug satisfaction.
Lavishing crocodile tears on a segment of the population
for whom they've shown precious little concern in the
past, they point to the black underclass as evidence of the
failure of the welfare system. Clearly, they argue, govern
ment handouts have not helped to raise the members of
the underclass out of poverty. Indeed, welfare may actu
ally contribute to the impoverishment of lower class
blacks by fostering dependency and relieving young black
men of their responsibilities to the children they sire out
of wedlock. This irresponsibility goes hand in hand with
the duplicity of the traditional black leadership who con
tinually excuse the alleged failure of blacks to acquire
their portion of the American pie with what columnist
George Will terms "the all-purpose alibi of 'white rac
ism'." The problems of the black underclass, Will and his
ilk contend, cannot be solved by vigorous enforcement of
civil rights laws or "condescending 'compassion' " on the
part of the government, but must be overcome by
strengthening the black family structure, and instilling
moral values and a sense of responsibility in immoral, ir
responsible black youths — a matter for the black com
munity alone to solve.
The liberal response to this hard-hitting argument has
been generally weak and ineffective. It is ineffective be
cause it is familiar. White racism helped to create the con
ditions which allow the black underclass to exist; any
group of people living in abject poverty develop social
pathologies, as the early experiences of many immigrant
groups and of present-day poor white families demon
strate: the irresponsibility of black males in the underclass
is not a product of some inherent defect, but the result of
low expectations and low self-esteem that constrict one's
perception of his freedom of choice and his ability to con
trol his fate. The U.S. public has heard it all before, and

though such assertions are for the most part well
supported by evidence (psychological studies are particu
larly strong in supporting the correlation between expec
tations and self-esteem with performance), if anything is
true in this consume-and-dispose culture, it is that
familiarity breeds contempt. An unpleasant truth ceases
to be true when it begins to be boring. Even black
Americans fall prey to this intellectual ennui; 57 percent
of the blacks surveyed in a recent Washington Post/ABC
News poll agreed with the statement that if blacks would
try harder, they could be as well off as whites — as if the
mere 20-odd years that have elapsed since institutional
and societal barriers to black progress began to break
down were sufficient time to overcome centuries of
deprivation.
The liberal response is weak because it is too narrow.
There are elements of truth in the conservative argument,
and difficult questions for which answers must be found.
Instead of acknowledging this, however, white liberals
seem content to reassert politically useless arguments as if
what is at stake here are the laurels for winning an
ideological shouting match rather than the lives of 3.5 mil
lion people. The traditional black leadership, on the other
hand, is loath to divert too much attention to the under
class for fear that by publicly recognizing the problem,
they will lend ammunition to those who would like noth
ing more than to dismiss blacks' problems as a matter of
cultural inferiority beyond the reach of ameliorative ef
forts.
The current debate — and the resulting polarization of
viewpoints which should be synthesized — binds black
America in general, and the black underclass in particular,
into a tragic catch-22. It is true that current government
programs are not likely to have much of a direct impact in
terms of building stronger families in the black underclass,
but one cannot help oneself by mere fiat. The black un
derclass cannot raise itself out of poverty simply because
the government decides that it must, not even if welfare
payments were discontinued as a form of incentive. The
underclass is thus immobilized because the liberal argu
ment is quite correct: underclass blacks are victimized by
the conditions of poverty which discourage them from
adopting mainstream American values. Conservatives,
however, are justified in arguing that the black underclass
cannot become independent, productive members of soci
ety until they are made to accept responsibility for their
lives and actions. This acceptance of responsibility cannot
occur unless conditions are changed so that the adoption
of conventional morality and life styles is rewarded and
reinforced. Such a change of conditions minimally re
quires quality education and a substantial improvement of
the environment in which the black underclass lives, and
that requires imaginative intervention from both the
public and private sectors. Conservatives, for what they
consider to be legitimate reasons, would be opposed to
any extensive — and therefore effective — intervention.
Not that the debate is likely to even shift in that direction;
liberals, fearful of playing into the hands of racists and
conservatives, will continue to hedge upon turning full at
tention to the problem. Who suffers? The black under
class, and all black Americans. The dilemma is as out
rageous as it is commonplace; once again, the U.S. politi
cal and governmental apparatus shows itself unwilling and
unable to transcend partisan struggles and find solutions
to complex problems.

part of the government, but must be overcome by
strengthening the black family structure, and instilling
moral values and a sense of responsibility in immoral, ir
responsible black youths — a matter for the black com
munity alone to solve.
The liberal response to this hard-hitting argument has
been generally weak and ineffective. It is ineffective be
cause it is familiar. White racism helped to create the con
ditions which allow the black underclass to exist; any
group of people living in abject poverty develop social
pathologies, as the early experiences of many immigrant
groups and of present-day poor white families demon
strate: the irresponsibility of black males in the underclass
is not a product of some inherent defect, but the result of
low expectations and low self-esteem that constrict one's
perception of his freedom of choice and his ability to con
trol his fate. The U.S. public has heard it all before, and

though such assertions are for the most part well
supported by evidence (psychological studies are particu
larly strong in supporting the correlation between expec
tations and self-esteem with performance), if anything is
true in this consume-and-dispose culture, it is that
familiarity breeds contempt. An unpleasant truth ceases
to be true when it begins to be boring. Even black
Americans fall prey to this intellectual ennui; 57 percent
of the blacks surveyed in a recent Washington Post/ABC
News poll agreed with the statement that if blacks would
try harder, they could be as well off as whites — as if the
mere 20-odd years that have elapsed since institutional
and societal barriers to black progress began to break
down were sufficient time to overcome centuries of
deprivation.
The liberal response is weak because it is too narrow.
There are elements of truth in the conservative argument,
and difficult questions for which answers must be found.
Instead of acknowledging this, however, white liberals
seem content to reassert politically useless arguments as if
what is at stake here are the laurels for winning an
ideological shouting match rather than the lives of 3.5 mil
lion people. The traditional black leadership, on the other
hand, is loath to divert too much attention to the under
class for fear that by publicly recognizing the problem,
they will lend ammunition to those who would like noth
ing more than to dismiss blacks' problems as a matter of
cultural inferiority beyond the reach of ameliorative ef
forts.
The current debate — and the resulting polarization of
viewpoints which should be synthesized — binds black
America in general, and the black underclass in particular,
into a tragic catch-22. It is true that current government
programs are not likely to have much of a direct impact in
terms of building stronger families in the black underclass,
but one cannot help oneself by mere fiat. The black un
derclass cannot raise itself out of poverty simply because
the government decides that it must, not even if welfare
payments were discontinued as a form of incentive. The
underclass is thus immobilized because the liberal argu
ment is quite correct: underclass blacks are victimized by
the conditions of poverty which discourage them from
adopting mainstream American values. Conservatives,
however, are justified in arguing that the black underclass
cannot become independent, productive members of soci
ety until they are made to accept responsibility for their
lives and actions. This acceptance of responsibility cannot
occur unless conditions are changed so that the adoption
of conventional morality and life styles is rewarded and
reinforced. Such a change of conditions minimally re
quires quality education and a substantial improvement of
the environment in which the black underclass lives, and
that requires imaginative intervention from both the
public and private sectors. Conservatives, for what they
consider to be legitimate reasons, would be opposed to
any extensive — and therefore effective — intervention.
Not that the debate is likely to even shift in that direction;
liberals, fearful of playing into the hands of racists and
conservatives, will continue to hedge upon turning full at
tention to the problem. Who suffers? The black under
class, and all black Americans. The dilemma is as out
rageous as it is commonplace; once again, the U.S. politi
cal and governmental apparatus shows itself unwilling and
unable to transcend partisan struggles and find solutions
to complex problems.

In every political season there emerges a hot, "new"
issue — some matter which raises consciousness, sparks
thunderous debate, and, as quickly as it appears, gets filed
away unsolved. We may already be approaching the latter
stages in one such issue: the plight of the black American
"underclass," a plight belatedly brought to the attention
of the public and the media by a recent CBS documentary,
"The Vanishing Family — Crisis in Black America." The
black underclass, comprising some 20 percent of the
American black population and including almost 3.5 mil
lion human beings, is generally characterized by rampant
teenage pregnancy, a high rate of illegitimate births, a
high frequency of single-parent families, high unemploy
ment, high crime rates and chronic poverty. Isolated from
mainstream America, their lives might well be described
by Thomas Hobbes' vision of man's life prior to the ad
vent of government — "poor, nasty, brutish and short."

Modern-day conservatives, of course, reject the notion
that government can do much to alleviate the woes of the
black underclass. Many of them have reacted to the CBS
documentary with something not unlike smug satisfaction.
Lavishing crocodile tears on a segment of the population
for whom they've shown precious little concern in the
past, they point to the black underclass as evidence of the
failure of the welfare system. Clearly, they argue, govern
ment handouts have not helped to raise the members of
the underclass out of poverty. Indeed, welfare may actu
ally contribute to the impoverishment of lower class
blacks by fostering dependency and relieving young black
men of their responsibilities to the children they sire out
of wedlock. This irresponsibility goes hand in hand with
the duplicity of the traditional black leadership who con
tinually excuse the alleged failure of blacks to acquire
their portion of the American pie with what columnist
George Will terms "the all-purpose alibi of 'white rac
ism'." The problems of the black underclass, Will and his
ilk contend, cannot be solved by vigorous enforcement of
civil rights laws or "condescending 'compassion' " on the
part of the government, but must be overcome by
strengthening the black family structure, and instilling
moral values and a sense of responsibility in immoral, ir
