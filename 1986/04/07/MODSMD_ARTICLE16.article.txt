## Mideast tangle is not Israel's fault 
### 
Nancy Latham, in her latest column, claims that
Israel pursues belligerent policies and has no desire
for peace in the Middle East. She implies that Israel
is to blame for the break down of the Mideast
peace talks: if Israel were not naturally prone
toward violence, problems in the Middle East
would magically disappear. In making these accu
sations. she ignores a major reason for the break
down of the peace talks: continuing Arab unwill
ingness to recognize Israel.

Latham says that Israel now has the power and
the desire to dominate the Middle East. In fact. Is
rael's power in the region is quite limited.
Geographically. Israel is tiny. Every military base
and population center in that country is within five
minutes living time of the MIGs located in sur
rounding countries. Israel has about 3 million
citizens: the surrounding countries have upwards of
100 million.
Israel's vulnerability to surrounding countries
would be irrelevant if these countries were friendly.
This is not the case. These countries have consis
tently initiated hostilities against Israel. At Israel's
inception in 1948. for example, armies from vir
tually every Arab country attacked it in an attempt
to deny Israel its independent status. Arab radio
reports betrayed the strident and uncompromising
attitude taken b\ the invaders. These radio reports
promised that the Arabs would not only defeat Is
rael. but drive all Israelis' "into the sea.' The Is
raelis defeated this attack. In the process, the Is
raelis also developed deep suspicions of the sur
rounding countries' motives.

People like Nancy Latham may claim that Arab
radio statements in the 1940s no longer apply and
that Israel is only using them to justify current ag
gression. However, the facts say otherwise. After
40 years, no Arab country except for Egypt has
signed a peace treaty, established diplomatic rela
tions or even recognized Israel's right to exist. Are
these actions indicative of countries which want
peace?
Israel, on the other hand, has shown that it will
make great sacrifices to promote peace. The Camp
Daivd accords are the most obvious manifestation
of this, in spite of Latham's contention that they are
a sham. In this treaty. Israel gave up the Sinai, over
half of its territory. In exchange, it got diplomatic
recognition from Egypt. Israel would not have
made such an unfair trade if it were bent on
hegemony in the Middle East.
Latham constructs an imaginative reason as to
why Israel signed the Camp David accords. Her
contention is that Israel surrendered the Sinai in
order to draw world attention away from its inva
sion of Lebanon. This argument does not stand on
its own logic. Again, if Israel is land hungry, why
would it willingly give up half its territory? The real
reason for Israel's invasion of Lebanon must be
seen in the context of the over-all situation in the
Middle East, which I will now discuss.
I already mentioned how the Arab inability to
recognize Israel adds to the violability of the
region. Another factor which adds to the tension is
the massive arms build up by the countries sur
rounding Israel. In Syria, for example, the Soviet
Union has installed the most advanced surface-to
air missiles in the Soviet arsenal.

Even relations with Egypt have cooled con
siderably since Israel completed its withdrawal and
Egypt occupied the Sinai. Egyptian nationalists are
believed to have been behind the assassination of
former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. They
were incensed that Sadat had signed a peace treaty
with Israel. Current Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarack respects these nationalists' strong influ
ence in Egypt and has cut off practically all trade
with Israel. He has even withdrawn Egypt's ambas
sador to Israel, a symbol of growing tensions be
tween Egypt and Israel.
In short, Israel remains as vulnerable as ever to
Arab hostility. The invasion of Lebanon was not an
attempt by Israel, as Latham claims, to take over
more land, but rather an attempt to counter overt
Arab hostilities against it. Before the Israel inva
sion. northern Israeli border settlements were con
tinually attacked by Palistinian fighters, Israel
launched the invasion to remove this PLO threat.
Latham's argument as to why there is no peace in
the Middle East is misleading in light of the facts. I
do not mean to imply that Israel shares no respon
sibility for the turmoil in the Middle East. Israel
has, however, made real attempts to establish
peace, as seen in the Camp David accords. People
like Latham are all too willing to look at Israel's
military actions as attempts to establish military
dominance in the area. In fact. Israel's military op
tion is only used when all possibilities for compro
mise and peace are removed. Given the current
Arab arms build up and continuing refusal to
negotiate with Israel, Israel's defensive military ac
tions become understandable.
