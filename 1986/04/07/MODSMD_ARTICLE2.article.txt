# Pendleton resignation urged
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A senior fellow at the Hoover Institution
has asked for the resignation of Clarence
Pendleton, the controversial chairman of
the U.S. Commission of Civil Rights.
In a letter Friday. John Bunzel, who
serves on the commission, told Pendleton
that his "inflammatory rhetoric" has
damaged his effectiveness and that the com
mission "would best be served by your res
ignation/'
"During the two-and-a-half years I have
been a member of the commission, I have
been increasingly disturbed by your inflam
matory rhetoric. It has too often stilled
rather than contributed to the kind of ra
tional and respectful debate of complex is
sues that is needed today," Bunzel said.
Bunzel also criticized Pendleton for
"attacking the motives and integrity" of his

opponents, stating that such behavior costs
Pendleton the chance to "exert effective in
fluence" on the commission.
The letter specifically cited Pendleton's
charges that those who disagreed with his
views were creating a " 'new racism." "
Pendleton also jeopardized the commis
sion's function as an independent monitor
ing agency with his "frequent acknowledge
ment" as a friend of the Reagan Adminis
tration and member of the Republican
Party, Bunzel said.
Bunzel told The Daily last night that he
has considered calling for Pendleton's resig
nation "for almost a year" before the letter
was delivered Friday to Pendleton's hotel in
Washington, D.C.
"It's not something that I enjoy because
he is a friend of mine,"' Bunzel said, adding
that it would have been easier to "simply to
put (his grievances) under the rug" and not
write the letter.

Bunzel. however, said that the problems
were not something that could be ignored
any longer.
"The easy thing and the right thing are
seldom the same thing," he said, noting that
"at some point I finally decided that this was
the time to do it."
Bunzel's letter, however, was not without
praise for Pendleton.
"Traversing the country, diligently at
tending meetings of both the national com
mission and its state committees, sharing
memories of a youth born under segregation
â€” for your commitment and dedication I
have only admiration," Bunzel said.
Bunzel also stressed in the letter that
Pendleton's own opinions on civil rights is
sues were not involved in the call for resig
nation, stating that the commission must
"reflect a diversity of views" for ending dis
crimination and achieving equal opportu
nity in the United States.
