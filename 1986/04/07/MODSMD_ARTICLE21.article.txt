# Cardinal wins one in south
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Women's tennis heavy
weights Stanford and USC met
Friday in Los Angeles knowing
that their past matches have
been long and hotly-contested.
This weekend was no differ
ent. While the tale of the tape
seemed to favor No. 2 Stan
ford, the No. 3 Trojans showed
that they could go the distance,
winning four of five three-set
matches to upset the previously
undefeated Cardinal 6-3.
The victory raised USC's
record to 14-1 and in all proba
bility assured the Trojans of the
nation's No. 1 ranking. The
Cardinal regrouped to nar
rowly edge San Diego State 5-4
the following morning in San
Diego, upping its record to 11-
I.
Stanford looked to be the fa
vorite heading into the match
with USC, having notched a
road victory over No. 1 Trinity
on March 27. But the Cardinal
finally became a victim of its
demanding road schedule.
"1 thought we could do it,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I thought we lined up
well on paper.
"We felt good after the
Texas trip (over spring
break)," Brennan added. "We
just couldn't do it down there. I
think the girls are starting to
realize how much more difficult
it is to play on the road than at
home."
During earlier road trips in
Arizona and Texas, the Card
inal was greeted by large, noisy
and — obviously — partisan
crowds. Though they were par
tisan, the USC fans were not
large in number, nor could you
say that they made a racket.
The Trojan players, small in
number also, did make a lot of
noise, however.
Most notable was sophomore
sensation Caroline Kuhlman,
