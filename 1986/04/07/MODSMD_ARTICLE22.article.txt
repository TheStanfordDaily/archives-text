## Louis wins NCAA all around 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
LINCOLN — Friday and Saturday
on the campus of the University of
Nebraska, the Stanford men's gym
nastics team ended its most successful
season ever. Led by the individual all
around championship performance of
Jon Louis, the squad took home the
NCAA third-place trophy and some
new-found respect.
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada,
whose press conference quips con
cerning Buddha delighted the press
corps throughout the weekend here,
was named the NCAA West Region
Coach of the Year.
Stanford recorded 282.15 points in
Friday's 10-team preliminary to ad
vance to the three-team finals Satur
day afternon, where it dropped down
to 279.5. The Cardinal's unspec
tacular performance was even less
spectacular in light of the fierce battle
for first between Arizona State and
Nebraska.
That battle, which epitomized the
nonstop thrilling action of the entire
championships, ended with ASU as
king, but only after about 20 minutes
of heated dispute between Cornhus
ker Francis Allen and the meet offi
cials.
Saturday night. 4.000 fans walked
into the Bob Devaney Sports Center
knowing they were in for a treat, and
they got a spectacular one as
the best of the NCAA gymnasts put
together the makings of a two hour
highlight film in the individual event
championships.
The preliminaries were full of
surprises. Right from the start, it was
evident that then-No. 1 Nebraska and
the Cardinal would be in the running,
but that No. 3 UCLA, the Pacific 10
champion, would not. The Bruins
started sour and never quite
recovered. As sophomore sensation
Brian Ginsberg said. "It was pretty
much a disaster as a whole."
Meanwhile, No. 8 Oklahoma
threatened to pull an upset and
squeak into the finals. Going into the
last rotation, the Sooners were a
tenth of a point ahead of the Card
inal. in third place.
Stanford had gone strong into its
first three events then collapsed on
the parallel bars. A 48.3 on the high
bar, the highest single event team
score of the championships, put the
Cardinal back above water, and the
team looked good with its normally
strong floor exercise set coming up.
Stanford managed only a 46.3,

however, and faced a harsh fact: the
Cardinal had to hit on its worst event,
the pommel horse. Stanford did. with
three 9.65s from Louis. Randy Be
sosa and Chuck Gerardo. A shocked
and teary-eyed Oklahoma saw its
hopes flash away, finishing fourth by
.45 points despite a strong final-event
performance.
Who took first Friday night? While
Nebraska and Stanford struggled, the
explosive Sun Devils exploded in a
burst of fireworks which would not
subside until after Saturday night's
final routine.
The pillar of consistency among the
surprisingly inconsistent Cardinal was
the senior co-captain Louis. Last
year's fifth place all-arounder, Louis
did not miss all night, finishing up at
57.6. a quarter of a point ahead of
runner-up Ginsberg.
The fact that Louis' name did not
even appear on the computer
scorecards released throughout
Friday's meet epitomized the lack of
respect held for Stanford gymnastics.
When asked about the fact that he
was left off the list. Louis responded,
"It didn't surprise me."
"1 knew 1 was capable of winning,
and I knew a lot of people didn't
think I was," Louis said.
The excitement of Friday's meet
made Saturday's performance — a
279.5 compared to the 253- pi us
scores of ASU and Nebraska — "a
little anticlimactic" for Gerardo and
the rest of the Cardinal. Stanford
never quite got off the ground and
soon all eyes were on the fight be
tween the hometown Huskers and the
sensational Sun Devils.
"Was Stanford out there?" the out
spoken Allen asked afterwards.
Unlike the night before, the Card
inal could not pick it up when it
had to. Of his team's letdown in the
final events, Gerardo said simply, "It
was a bad scene."
"We did well on the strength
events; we scored higher than the
other two teams," Hamada said. "But
we really showed our weaknesses in
our weak events."
Saturday night was a night of gym
nasts throwing their most crowd
pleasing sets. Louis and Besosa were
Stanford's only plaque winners,
placing second and fifth, respectively,
on the high bar.
The third-place finish was the high
est of Hamada's 13-year tenure and
comes on the heels of last year's
seventh-place finish.
