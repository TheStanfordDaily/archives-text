# The 						weekend results: Stanford 1, UCLA 1, Rain 1
## Make-up game slated for today 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — One sure-fire way to spoil a
weekend is to schedule a Stanford-UCLA baseball series.
It seems that whenever the two teams get together to
play a three-game set, umbrellas — and not bats — are a
ballplayer's best friend. A Cardinal-Bruin matchup means
only one thing, rain.
Almost a month ago at Stanford, a deluge cancelled two
of the three slated games. And. not surprisingly, there was
more of the same in usually dry Los Angeles last
weekend.
Things started innocently enough: Friday's opener, won
by UCLA 6-5, was played under dull sunshine. But after
that, the UCLA-Stanford curse set in. A consistent rain
fell throughout Saturday afternoon's 7-2 Stanford win,
and yesterday's wrapup contest was postponed and res
cheduled for today at 2 p.m.
Rain is again forecast for the Los Angeles area today.
By splitting the two games, Stanford maintained its
one-game lead over UCLA in the race for the Pacific 10
Southern Division title. The Cardinal moved to 8-4 in
league and 22-10 overall: the Bruins stand at 7-5. 27-13.
Elsewhere around the Six-Pac, USC (8-9 in the league)
and Arizona State (6-8) split a pair of games in Los An
geles in another rain-shortened series. In Tucson, Ariz.,
Arizona swept three games from visiting California to
move into third place with a Six-Pac record ot 8-6. 1 he
Bears, 6-11, fell deeper into the basement, 4 1 j games be
hind the Cardinal.
Saturday, Kevin Kunkel threw eight shutout innings
and Ed Sprague and Ron Witmeyer delivered bases
empty home runs to lift the Cardinal past the Bruins.
The Cardinal tallied two runs in the top of the fourth.
Mark Davis' line-drive triple into the right-field corner
scored John Ramos, who had singled. Davis came across
when third baseman Scott Cline booted Doug Robbins
ground ball.
In the seventh. Sprague belted a 1-0 offering from
Randy Hennis, the UCLA starter and loser, out to right
center field for his second round tripper of the year.
Ken Green, the next batter, singled, then moved to
second on Frank Carey's sacrifice bunt. He scored on
Walt Harris' line double to the wall in left. Ramos plated
Harris with a two-out. RBI-single to right.
The Cardinal added its final runs in the eighth. Leading
off. Witmeyer drove a Hennis pitch over the fence in
right. For the left-hand hitting Witmeyer. it was his first
home run of the year. Toi Cook followed with a walk,
stole second and third, and scored an out later on Green s
squeeze bunt.
Through it all. Kunkel held UCLA at bay: he carried a
three-hit shutout into the bottom of the ninth inning,
having struck out seven and walked two.
"Pretty much all of my pitches were working.' said
Kunkel, who improved his record to 2-3.
From his first pitch of the ball game — a changeup that
had leadoff hitter Tory Lovullo swinging out of his shoes
— Kunkel kept the Bruins off balance by mixing in off
speed pitches with his fastball and slider. "My changeup
was good today," Kunkel said. "It complements every
thing else, and the batters can't help but be wary ot it.

The right-hander from Leonardo, N.J., surrendered a
one-out single in the first before retiring the next 11
Bruins to face him.
In the bottom of the fifth he encountered his first jam.
A leadoff single by Bruin left-fielder Steve Hisey and a
walk to pinch-hitter Steve Stowell put runners on first and
second with none out. Kunkel escaped by inducing two
ground balls and striking out Bobby Holly to end the
threat.
Kunkel again stranded runners on first and second in
UCLA's seventh, getting two fly outs.
' He (Kunkel) pitched an outstanding game." Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "His performance gave us a
real big lift."
It's ironic that Kunkel. who was hit hard by non-league
opponents early in the year, even had a chance to turn in
the effort. It was his first start in a Six-Pac game this year.
"I didn't know until about two hours before the game
that I would start." he said. "(Because) our pitching staff
is so deep, the coaches have to make a last-minute deci
sion (about who will start).
"They tossed the old three-headed coin, and luckily my
name came up." It was unclear until game time whether
Kunkel. Rob Wassenaar or A 1 Osuna would start.
Kunkel finally weakened in the bottom of the ninth.
Three consecutive base hits — including a two-run home
run by John Joslyn — sent Stanford's starter to the
showers. Osuna came in to get the final three outs.
"Everbody wants a shutout, but I knew it was my time.
Kunkel said. "We don't want to take any chances, espe
cially since we're playing for first place."
In Friday's opener, first place was indeed the prize.
With its 6-5 win. the Bruins tied the Cardinal for the top
spot in the Six-Pac.
Alex Sanchez. UCLA's right-handed starter, dueled
Jack McDowell. Stanford's ace. for nine innings before
recording his ninth win in 10 decisions on the year.
Sanchez gave up five runs, only two of which were
earned, and scattered nine hits. The sophomore walked
three and stuck out 10 in completing his first game.
Stanford jumped to a quick 1-0 lead on Ramos' solo
home run. his second, in the first before UCLA roughed
up McDowell for four runs in the bottom of the second.
After a pair of walks and an infield single. Cline drilled
McDowell's 2-1 pitch to straight-away center field for a
grand slam. It was Cline's fourth home run on the year.
Stanford came up with three runs in the fourth and one
more in the fifth to go ahead by a run, 5-4. but UCLA
rallied for a pair of runs off McDowell in its half of the
fifth to take the lead for good.
Cline reached on third baseman Ruben Amaro's throw
ing error and Holly walked to start things for the Bruins.
A balk scored one run and a RBI-single by catcher Todd
Zeile brought home UCLA's go-ahead run.
With the loss. McDowell's record fell to 8-2.
Today's game at Jackie Robinson Stadium will match
Stanford's Lee Plemel. 2-1. against UCLA s Jeff Conine.
4-1. Plemel. who sports a 2.0S ERA. is coming off a
three-hit shutout of ASU in Tempe: Conine, a right
hander. enters with a 5.14 ERA.
The contest can be heard locally on KZSU. 90.1 FM.
David Fisher will handle the play-by-play.

Kevin Kunkel may have pitched his way hack into the starting rotation with eight strong innings on Saturday
as the Cardinal beat UCLA 7-2.
who defeated Cardinal junior Patty
Fendick in the No. i singles match 7-
6. 6-4. Kuhlman, the nation's top
ranked player, raised her singles
record to 11-0.
"Kuhlman is very good, Brennan
said. " Day in and day out, she s so
consistent."
The word consistent could also be
used to describe senior Heliane
Steden, the Trojans' No. 2 singles
player. Steden increased her season
record to 12-0 by deleating Stanfoid
freshman Marianne Werdel 6-4, 2-6,
7-5 in a match that was as decisive as
it was close.
The Steden-Werdel match was the
final singles match to end. Had Wer
del won, the Cardinal would have
been even at 3-3 with the doubles
matches remaining. Steden prevailed,
however, to give the Trojans a 4-2
lead, forcing the Cardinal to sweep
the doubles — a feat that Stanford
could not accomplish.
"That was very critical,*' Brennan
said. "1 thought we were going to win
that match. Marianne played quite
well.
Another crucial match was the No.
4 singles. Stanford junior Stephanie
Savides struggled, then played well,
then struggled again in losing 6-0, 4-
6, 6-2 to USC's Mary Norwood.
"Stephanie could have won," Bren
nan said.
The Cardinal did win one three-set
match, compliments of junior Leigh
Anne Eldredge. After dropping the
first set of the No. 3 singles 6-4,
Eldredge battled to beat the Trojans'
Maeve Quinlan 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Sophomore Kay Tittle garnered
Stanford's only other singles victory,
sweeping USC freshman Ginny
Purdy 7-6, 6-4 in the No. 5 singles
match.
Sophomore Cari Hagey, playing
for injured Eleni Rossides, was
defeated by the Trojans' Dana Levy
6-4, 6-3 in the No. 6 singles.
Though the USC match was clearly
the main event in this weekend's
card, Stanford did have to play up
and-down San Diego State at 10 a.m.
Saturday. The Aztecs were up, and
the Cardinal was nearly flattened.
Stanford had every right to be
emotionally and physically below par.
Less than 24 hours earlier, the team
had lost to USC.
"We turned things around a bit,"
Brennan said. "Patty won in three
sets, Leigh Anne won in three sets
and so did Kay."
Tittle's match was the closest of the
three-setters, and her victory came at
a key moment in the match. After
splitting the first two sets. Tittle won
the third set of her match 7-5.
