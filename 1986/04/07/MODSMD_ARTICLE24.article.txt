### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
Concluding a season marked with
the unprecedented success of a
youthful and relatively inexperienced
team, Stanford's women gymnasts
finished strongly in the NCAA
Northwest Regionals with a score of
181.50 and a fifth-place finish.
Placing ahead of the Cardinal were
Fullerton State in first, followed by
UCLA, Oregon State and Washing
ton; California finished sixth. Both
Fullerton and UCLA will now go on
to the nationals in Gainesville, Fla.,
April 18-19.
1 he team was very pleased with its

performance. "Everyone basically
did a good job," Stanford freshman
Laurence George said. "The team
was solid and consistent. I'm really
happy with how everyone did.
"Jessica (Armstrong) made a
double-back on the beam, Cheryl
(Doo) was consistent, Nancy
(Goldsmith) placed on beam and did
well overall, and Jinny (Rhee) got a
9.5 on bars and did well in the all
around," George said.
"Jinny could make nationals," she
added, "but we have to wait for
scores from the other regions to know
for sure."
The teams that definitely have tick
ets to the national competition are

Fullerton and UCLA, two traditional
powerhouses. "Fullerton looked
really good and definitely deserved to
win, and UCLA looked good, too,"
George said.
Though the Cardinal did not finish
as strongly as the two Southern Cali
fornia teams, it was nevetheless a
notable meet for the gymnasts. "We
scored well for regionals and finished
the season well," George concluded.
Sharing her sentiments was fresh
man teammate Sherri Evenson. "I
thought we did really well," she said.
"Everyone pulled together, overcame
sickness and did well. I think we
ended on a high note, which will get
us started well next season."
