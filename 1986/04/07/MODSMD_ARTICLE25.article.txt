# Golfers falter at Stanford
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Hosting the top teams on the West Coast in the first
round of the California Intercollegiate, the Stanford
women's golf team had hopes of showing itself to be the
cream of the crop.
But the Cardinal, hurt by mediocre performances from
veteran players, stands only in fourth place out of five
teams, and now must go on the road to play 36 holes
today at the Villages Golf Course in San Jose.
USC shot 297 as a team to emerge as the leader after
the first 18 holes. Homeward-bound San Jose State and
U.S. International University are close behind, knotted at
299. Long Beach State is in fifth place at 321.
Stanford at 3 10 is only 13 strokes off the pace, but the
Cardinal failed to capitalize on playing on familiar turf.
While Julie Carmichael played strongly with an even
par 73 yesterday, Adrienne Gilmartin fired a 78, Kathy
Kostas shot only a 79, and Kay Cornelius and Kathleen
McCarthy each stroked their way to 80s.

"We had really poor performances today from both
Cornelius and McCarthy," Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
said. "Cornelius, McCarthy and Kostas are seasoned
players. I had anticipated a stronger showing.
Carmichael's round placed her in a third-place tie with
SJSU's Libby Watson among the individuals. USIU Ail-
American Laurette Maritz leads with a 70, and a pair of
I rojans named Kim, Cathrein and Lasken, are tied for
second at 72.
"Julie since last fall has just played excellent, excellent
golf, Baldwin said. "She is solidly our No. 1 player now.
She has really come into her own in her senior year."
SJSU has three of the next four players on the leader
board: sixth-place Lisa Ipkendanz with a 74, and, after
Long Beach's Susan Giordani at 75, Dana Loflind and
Julie Ralls at 76.
While the tournament, with two rounds to go, is still
very much in doubt, the Cardinal needs to play much bet
ter in order make up the 13 strokes it trails by.
"(We) won't be satisfied with anything less," Baldwin
said.
