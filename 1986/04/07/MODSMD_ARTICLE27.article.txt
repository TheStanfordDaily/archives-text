# Dukes dominates in Texas Relays
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
It was hot and humid, and the
plane service was lousy, but the Stan
ford track team didn't seem to mind.
After being delayed for over five
hours on American Airlines, the team
didn't make it to its hotel rooms in
Austin, Tex., until nearly 5 a.m.
Friday. The Texas Relays started at 9
that same morning.
It wasn't a good way to start a
meet, and for at least one Cardinal
athlete, it showed. Working on three
hours of sleep, high jumper Brian
Marshall was unable to clear his
opening height. But for the rest of the
athletes, who competed later in the
day, it turned out to be just an incon
venience.
The womens' shot put began at 10
a.m., and luckily for Stanford, shot
putter Pam Dukes was ready to com
pete. "I just wanted to bring the team
up a little bit, bring up some spirits,"
Dukes said.
And with most of the the squad
watching. Dukes did just what she in
tended; she gave the team some in
spiration.
At first it didn't look so good: with
only one preliminary throw remain
ing, Dukes had thrown 48 feet, a toss
which probably wouldn't get her to
the finals.
She only had one throw left, and
"there was a lot of pressure. I was a
little worried," she said.
There may have been a lot of pres
sure, but with everything resting on
just one throw. Dukes relaxed and let
loose a toss of 55-7 1/4, a mark which
wouldn't be beaten. Dukes' nearest
competitor was Teresa Williford of
Louisiana State, who finished a dis
tant second at 51 feet.
Dukes also placed sixth in the dis
cus, but this time, she wasn't the star.
Her teammate, Karen Nickerson, the
meet's defending champion, stole the
show.

Nickerson won the event, and in
doing so became one of the Texas
Relays* few two-time champions. Her
throw of 175-11 was a few feet short
of her personal best, but it was good
for a victory and a second straight
crown.
Wollman was especially pleased
with Nickerson's performance, be
cause he had had her work out in the
weight room the day before the meet.
He's training her for big improve
ments later in the season, so early
season wins are just the frosting on
the cake.
In the women's heptathalon,
Denise Gatzambide turned in her
best point total ever, placing fifth in
the competition. Her score of 5,392
points also qualified her for the
NCAA championships, in which
Wollman believes she has the poten
tial to become an All-American.
In the men's meet, the Cardinal's
lone placewinners were the members
of the distance medley relay, Jeff At
kinson, Christian Skoog, Brian Con
noly and Steve Schadler.
When the race ended, Stanford was
actually in second, but the team was
given first because the judges dis
qualifed the winning Arkansas team
for running out of their lane.
"The guy tried to cut me off on the
inside," Skoog said. Skoog ran the
400-meter leg of the relay, and near
the end of his lap, an Arkansas run
ner cut in too soon and fouled him,
thereby forfeiting Arkansas' victory.
Arkansas continued to run, but for
the Razorbacks the race was over.
For Stanford, the circumstances could
have been a little better, but the win
was still appreciated.
"I thought it was a pretty blatant
foul, but, anyway, I'm just glad that
we won," Connoly said.
In any case, Stanford will get a
chance to defend the victory in three
weeks when the two relays will meet
again at the Penn Relays.
