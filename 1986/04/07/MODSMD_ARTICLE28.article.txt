# Netters split against southern rivals

### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
This past weekend's Bruin and Trojan invasion
of the Farm offered its share of tight matches and
blowouts, sun and rain, indoors and outdoors
play, a continued winning streak and a continued
losing streak.
Under clear skies on Friday, UCLA jumped to
a 4-2 lead after singles play and hung on in the
doubles to record a 5-4 victory over the Cardinal.
On Saturday, however, it was Stanford who
started quickly. In between the drizzling after
noon rains, the Cardinal won five out of the First
six matches played to clinch the victory over
use.
The Trojans came back to sweep the three in
door matches played on Saturday night to make
the final score 5-4.
In Friday's match, UCLA used the winning
play of veterans Brad Pearce and Brett Green
wood, and freshmen Dan Nahirney and Buff Far
row to edge the Cardinal.
Nahirney completed the first victory of the day
for the Bruins by defeating Stanford senior Eric
Rosenfeld 6-4, 7-6, 7-5. Farrow, meanwhile,
picked up UCLA's fourth singles victory by rally
ing to beat John Letts 1-6, 7-6, 6-3.
"I think Farrow's match was the key," UCLA
Coach Glenn Bassett said. "He was kind of down

and out, but when he came back 1 guess he swung
it (the match) our way."
But Stanford Coach Dick Gould thought
Nahirney's was the swing match. "Nahirney's
match was the key," he said. "1 thought for sure
Eric had it turned around, but he stopped doing
what got him there and let Nahirney back in."
The Stanford squad showed some mettle in the
ensuing doubles play. Needing to sweep all three
matches to surmount the UCLA lead, the Card
inal team gave the Bruins quite a run.
In the No. 1 doubles, Stanford's Dan Goldie
and Jim Grabb defeated Pearce and Ken Diller
6-4, 4-6, 6-2. Diller gave away the final point of
the match by throwing his racquet for the second
time, which prompted the umpire to assess a
penalty point and utter the words that doomed
the Bruin pair: "game, set, match Stanford."
In No. 2 doubles, the Cardinal duo of Patrick
McEnroe and John Letts took the lOth-ranked
team of Nahirney and Michael Kures to three
sets before losing 3-6, 7-5, 6-2.
Saturday's match was schizophrenic in more
ways than one. Because of rain, it started indoors
at 11:30 a.m. with the No. 6 match of Scott
Moody versus Trojan Scott Brownsberger.
Moody used a big serve and quick volleys to win
7-6, 6-3.
The rains stopped long enough for the teams to
move outside. Then it started to drizzle, so the

No. 5 match between Cardinal Letts and
Swede Jonas Wallgard moved back to Maples.
Then, of course, the rain stopped. Finally the
No. 3 and 4 singles matches started outdoors.
McEnroe used a lethal and unrelenting back
hand to extend his winning streak to 12 straight
matches by defeating USC's Tim Pawsat 6-1, 6-
3. Right away Stanford had moved to a 2-0 lead.
"McEnroe played very well, and of course so
did Moody," USC Coach Dick Leach said. "They
won it for Stanford/' -
But they didn't win it singlehandedly. First,
Rosenfeld won his No. 4 singles match against
Trojan John Carras 7-5, 6-2.
Next, McEnroe and Letts teamed up to defeat
Brownsberger and Wallgard 7-6, 6-2. Finally,
Rosenfeld and Moody upended Luke Jensen and
John Washer 6-4, 6-2 to clinch the match for
Stanford.
While the match was formally over, approxi
mately 2,000 fans filed into Maples Pavilion for
what promised to be some of the best college ten
nis in the country.
Stanford's three-year All-American Grabb
faced ambidexterous freshman sensation Jensen
in a match that was dominated by whoever was
serving.
On the super-fast carpet which was laid over
the basketball floor, each player had
a relatively easy time holding his
serve, and both the first and second
sets went to tie-breakers.
Jensen, who can serve either righty
or lefty and also hits overheads with
either hand, took the first tie-breaker
by a 7-5 score.
The two players stayed on serve in
the final set until Jensen finally broke
Grabb in the 10th game to take the
set 6-4 and the match. In all. the
players had held serve for 33 straight
games.
The second match of the evening
presented the top two players in the
nation, USC's No. 1-ranked Rick
Leach and Stanford's No. 2-ranked
Goldie.
The ranking's held up, as Leach
squeezed by with a 7-5, 7-6 victory
which extended Goldie's losing streak
to three. In the final match of the
night, Goldie and Grabb teamed up
to face Leach and Pawsat, and the
Trojans swiped two quick sets 6-4, 7-
6 to make the final team match score
5-4.

squeezed by with a 7-5, 7-6 victory
which extended Goldie's losing streak
to three. In the final match of the
night, Goldie and Grabb teamed up
to face Leach and Pawsat, and the
Trojans swiped two quick sets 6-4, 7-
6 to make the final team match score
5-4.
This past weekend's Bruin and Trojan invasion
of the Farm offered its share of tight matches and
blowouts, sun and rain, indoors and outdoors
play, a continued winning streak and a continued
losing streak.
Under clear skies on Friday, UCLA jumped to
a 4-2 lead after singles play and hung on in the
doubles to record a 5-4 victory over the Cardinal.
On Saturday, however, it was Stanford who
started quickly. In between the drizzling after
noon rains, the Cardinal won five out of the First
six matches played to clinch the victory over
use.
The Trojans came back to sweep the three in
door matches played on Saturday night to make
the final score 5-4.
In Friday's match, UCLA used the winning
play of veterans Brad Pearce and Brett Green
wood, and freshmen Dan Nahirney and Buff Far
row to edge the Cardinal.
Nahirney completed the first victory of the day
for the Bruins by defeating Stanford senior Eric
Rosenfeld 6-4, 7-6, 7-5. Farrow, meanwhile,
picked up UCLA's fourth singles victory by rally
ing to beat John Letts 1-6, 7-6, 6-3.
"I think Farrow's match was the key," UCLA
Coach Glenn Bassett said. "He was kind of down

and out, but when he came back 1 guess he swung
it (the match) our way."
But Stanford Coach Dick Gould thought
Nahirney's was the swing match. "Nahirney's
match was the key," he said. "1 thought for sure
Eric had it turned around, but he stopped doing
what got him there and let Nahirney back in."
The Stanford squad showed some mettle in the
ensuing doubles play. Needing to sweep all three
matches to surmount the UCLA lead, the Card
inal team gave the Bruins quite a run.
In the No. 1 doubles, Stanford's Dan Goldie
and Jim Grabb defeated Pearce and Ken Diller
6-4, 4-6, 6-2. Diller gave away the final point of
the match by throwing his racquet for the second
time, which prompted the umpire to assess a
penalty point and utter the words that doomed
the Bruin pair: "game, set, match Stanford."
In No. 2 doubles, the Cardinal duo of Patrick
McEnroe and John Letts took the lOth-ranked
team of Nahirney and Michael Kures to three
sets before losing 3-6, 7-5, 6-2.
Saturday's match was schizophrenic in more
ways than one. Because of rain, it started indoors
at 11:30 a.m. with the No. 6 match of Scott
Moody versus Trojan Scott Brownsberger.
Moody used a big serve and quick volleys to win
7-6, 6-3.
The rains stopped long enough for the teams to
move outside. Then it started to drizzle, so the

No. 5 match between Cardinal Letts and
Swede Jonas Wallgard moved back to Maples.
Then, of course, the rain stopped. Finally the
No. 3 and 4 singles matches started outdoors.
McEnroe used a lethal and unrelenting back
hand to extend his winning streak to 12 straight
matches by defeating USC's Tim Pawsat 6-1, 6-
3. Right away Stanford had moved to a 2-0 lead.
"McEnroe played very well, and of course so
did Moody," USC Coach Dick Leach said. "They
won it for Stanford/' -
But they didn't win it singlehandedly. First,
Rosenfeld won his No. 4 singles match against
Trojan John Carras 7-5, 6-2.
Next, McEnroe and Letts teamed up to defeat
Brownsberger and Wallgard 7-6, 6-2. Finally,
Rosenfeld and Moody upended Luke Jensen and
John Washer 6-4, 6-2 to clinch the match for
Stanford.
While the match was formally over, approxi
mately 2,000 fans filed into Maples Pavilion for
what promised to be some of the best college ten
nis in the country.
Stanford's three-year All-American Grabb
faced ambidexterous freshman sensation Jensen
in a match that was dominated by whoever was
serving.
On the super-fast carpet which was laid over
the basketball floor, each player had
a relatively easy time holding his
serve, and both the first and second
sets went to tie-breakers.
Jensen, who can serve either righty
or lefty and also hits overheads with
either hand, took the first tie-breaker
by a 7-5 score.
The two players stayed on serve in
the final set until Jensen finally broke
Grabb in the 10th game to take the
set 6-4 and the match. In all. the
players had held serve for 33 straight
games.
The second match of the evening
presented the top two players in the
nation, USC's No. 1-ranked Rick
Leach and Stanford's No. 2-ranked
Goldie.
The ranking's held up, as Leach
squeezed by with a 7-5, 7-6 victory
which extended Goldie's losing streak
to three. In the final match of the
night, Goldie and Grabb teamed up
to face Leach and Pawsat, and the
Trojans swiped two quick sets 6-4, 7-
6 to make the final team match score
5-4.
