### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Two matches in Southern Califor
nia this weekend proved no surprise
as the Stanford men's volleyball team
fell to No. 1 USC in three games and
defeated Cal State-Northridge in
four. Stanford is now 9-6 in Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball Associ
ation (CIVA) play, and currently
ranked seventh in the nation.
Friday night Stanford lost to unde
feated USC 1 1-15, 9-15, 13-15.
After a three-week layoff, the Card
inal met the Trojans for the first time
this season. USC remains atop the
CIV A with a 15-0 rcord.
Stanford senior Ail-American Jon
Root "had a good hitting night," ac

cording to teammate Chris Braun,
despite respraining his ankle in
practice last Thursday night.
"He hit real well," Braun said,
"even though his ankle was giving
him trouble on defense.
"USC was our first match in three
weeks," Braun continued. "We were
getting readjusted and working out
some bugs, trying out different defen
sive things. USC is a real steady team,
they didn't give us a chance to get
back into it."
"We sided out well enough to
win," Stanford freshman outside hit
ter Dave Johnson said, "but our
point-scoring plays were not effec
tive. You could see we hadn't played
in three weeks. We made a lot of
scoring errors."

The team fared better Saturday
night against Northridge, downing
the Matadors 15-11, 15-10, 14-16,
15-5. From his outside hitter posi
tion, Braun led Stanford with 26 kills
while sophomore Scott Fortune fol
lowed with 19. Root and junior Step
hen Blue both totalled 18 kills, and
Blue had a team-high .536 hitting
percentage.
Senior Chuck English, who missed
the first Stanford match, topped
Northridge with 20 kills and also had
a .400 average. John Bussington re
corded a .433 mark. In fact,
Northridge, which fell to 3-12 in
CIV A action, outhit Stanford as a
team .341 to .308.
"But we scored more points,"
Braun said. "We started slow but

played well towards the end.
Northridge can be really challenging,
but they didn't give us much trouble
last night. English was not too effec
tive."
The Cardinal faces No. 17 Loyola
Marymount tonight. The Lions took
Stanford to five games at Maples
Pavilion earlier this year after a long
delay. Loyola had missed its flight,
showed up late and wore Stanford
uniforms because the Lions' uniforms
wound up in San Jose.
"Loyola is not doing that well,"
Johnson said, "but they are always
keyed up to beat Stanford. It's not a
usual game for them. It will be a
tough game. It went five last time, but
we had been warming up for four
hours, and they were fresh."
