This is the first of a two-pan se
ries on the trends ami effects of
cocaine use at Stanford. The
second installment will appear on
Thursday.
Stanford students who indulge
in cocaine despite the risks of ad-

jP* ii' y

diction, heart failure or other
hazards face a new health threat:
quantities of the drug making its
way to campus may contain ben
zene, a carcinogen that has heen
banned from consumer products
because it has been shown to cause
leukemia.

"It certainly puts a new twist on
cocaine use." Dr. Willaim Hazle.
director of Stanford's Alcohol and
Drug Treatment Center, said Sat
urday. "(The complications suf
fered by users) are similar to
someone who inhales glue or paint
— it's the same compound."
Benzene began to show up in
cocaine in early 1985 after the
Drug Enforcement Agency
(DFA) took steps to restrict ex
ports of ether after finding that 98
percent of the ether exported to
Colombia — a primary cocaine ex
porting country — was going to
drug traffickers. In January 1985.
DEA officials began testing con
fiscated cocaine to determine what
was being used as a substitute, and
test results increasingly showed ben
zene. Last December, half the
cocaine seized in Florida contained
benzene.
"We can assume that benzene (in
cocaine) has been distributed
nationwide," DFA official Bill Deac
told The Daily Friday. Deac acknowl
edged that the benzene contamina
tion had resulted from the restrictions
of ether exports, but he said the prob
lem would disappear "if people
weren't breaking the law in the first
place."
"We're enforcing the law the best
way we know how," Deac said.
"What else can we do?"
Although no statistics currently ex
ist that accurately measure the extent
of cocaine use at Stanford — a survey
conducted by Cowell Health Center
two years ago revealed only that very
few students were willing to admit
any involvement with the drug at all
— Hazle estimated that based on na
tional statistics a majority of students
here have at least tried cocaine.
"We won't see (the results of the
contaminated cocaine) in the Stan
ford community first," Hazle said.
"We'd see it on the street first, and
then among the middle class." He
added that since the benzene con
tamination is a recent development
and long-term effects are still to be
ascertained. "This is another example

of how the chronic user is a 'social ex
periment."
Benzene taken in quantity can
counterbalance the effect of cocaine
by acting as a sedative, Hazle said,
even inducing a hypnotic or hal
lucinatory effect.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, associate
director of Counseling and Psycho
logical Services at Cowell, said Friday
that while the body "can handle one
or two insults." prolonged exposure
to such an "extremely corrosive" sub
stance as benzene could lead to liver
damage or other damaging long-term
effects.
Dr. Inaba Darryl, director of the
Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic
in San Francisco, said Friday he is
"sure" that at least 50 percent of all
cocaine making its way to the Bay
Area contains benzene.
"The real issue is whether there's
enough in cocaine to cause harm."
Darryl said.
Students at Stanford who use
cocaine for recreational purposes had
mixed responses to the benzene
threat.
"I'm going to try (cocaine) a lot
less often," one junior said. "I need
to know for sure whether it's in the
cocaine or not, and I want to know its
effects."
"This is the '80s version of 'Reefer
Madness' (a 1930s government anti
marijuana film)," said one senior.
