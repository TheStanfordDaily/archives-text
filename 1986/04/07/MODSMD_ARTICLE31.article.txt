# Women finish first in Classic
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
Blustery weather, strong tail winds and some of the
finest rowing schools in the country and the world
couldn t completely faze the Stanford crew team this
weekend in the San Diego Crew Classic. The Cardinal
women dominated the competition and won the regatta,
while the men also did well but were shut down in the end
by strong competition and an unfortunate disqualification.
"It was very exciting," Stanford men's Coach Ken
Dreyfuss said. "Lots of good things happened, and all the
crews are feeling better,"
The Cardinal women showed that they meant business
as they took the collegiate novice and the open novice
races, tying for second in the junior varsity race and taking
a strong third in the varsity competition. The combined
score easily gave the Stanford team the overall women's
crown.
Each women s boat beat up to 10 other schools on
their way to victory, including San Diego State, the Uni
versity of San Diego, UCLA, Loyola, Mills and Califor
nia. I he varsity boat was beaten by Wisconsin and Wash
ington in a very close race.
"We couldn't have been much happier," Stanford
rower Kristin Dahl said. "Second behind Washington is a
good place to be, and I think we'll be able to pass them
soon."

The men's team, on the other hand, placed only one
crew in the finals, but came away satisfied with its perfor
mance. The men's novice, junior varsity and varsity failed
to make it past the qualifying races while the freshmen
boat made it to the finals only to be disqualified in contro
versial fashion.
The varsity team strategy of racing conservatively failed
to add up to a place in the finals.
" Despite the strong tail wind, we were determined to go
with long, low, effective strokes, and it succeeded,"
Dreyfuss said. "We kept in contact with the field. We'll be
more aggressive in two weeks and even more so after
that."
The Stanford frosh crew was very successful in winning
its qualifying nice by open water, but they met with diffi
culty in their final race. After swerving to avoid the boat
from Orange Coast College, the Cardinal boat collided
with the boat from Cal and protests were lodged. OCC
and Cal were allowed a rerace with Cal eventually win
ning. The Stanford boat was disqualified.
"We're ready to go beat the hell out of OCC and Cal
next time," Stanford crew member Andy Winden said.
"And we will, too."
The incident leaves a chip on the shoulder for the Card
inal as it approaches its home regatta in two weeks.
"We're not satisfied, but we feel in a position to be a
real factor in these races in the future," Dreyfuss said.
