Weinberger to meet with Aquino
MANILA, Philippines — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
arrived last night for an 18-hour state visit to the Philippines that will in
clude the first meeting between President Cora/on Aquino and a mem
ber of President Reagan's Cabinet in the six weeks since her government
took power.
Weinberger will also meet with top Philippine military leaders today
to discuss the future of U.S. military aid here and assess the ongoing
rebellion by armed Communist insurgents, which some Pentagon
analysts fear could ultimately threaten the security of the two large U.S.
military bases north of Manila.
The bases themselves will not be a major issue in Weinberger's talks
with Aquino, according to a Department of Defense spokesman who
said last night that Weinberger believes the future of the bases is secure,
at least until the present agreement with the Philippine government
expires in 1991.
Aquino said during her presidential campaign earlier this year that she
would allow the bases to remain at least until 1991 and that she would
set up a committee to prepare for negotiations with U.S. officials on a
new agreement later this decade.
Accompanying Weinberger are several senior Pentagon officials,
among them the Defense Department's top adviser on military assis
tance programs to American allies.
Under the present agreement covering Clark Air Base and Subic Bay
Naval Base, the Reagan Administration has pledged to provide $425
million in military aid and credits for military purchases by the
Philippine government. Much of that money has not yet been ear
marked, and Weinberger will meet over lunch today with Philippine
Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile to explore how that money should
be spent.
Envoys seek to revive peace talks
PANAMA CITY — In an atmosphere of urgency, eight Latin Ameri
can foreign ministers sought yesterday to breathe new life into the Con
tadora peace talks as an alternative to U.S. aid for anti-Sandi'nista guer
rillas in Nicaragua.
On the last day of the two-day gathering here, the first in which all 13
Latin nations involved have come together, the talks stumbled on sharp
differences between Nicaragua's Marxist-led Sandinista government on
the one hand and the U.S.-allied governments of El Salvador, Costa
Rica and Honduras on the other. This fundamental split has prevented
substantial gains ever since Mexico, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela
launched the effort on Contadora Island off Panama in January 1983 to
prevent expanded warfare in the region.
With the U.S. House of Representatives expected to reconsider on
April 15 a Reagan Administration proposal for $100 million in mostly
military aid for the rebels, the effort has taken on new immediacy in
recent weeks, diplomats said. Against this background, the foreign min
isters of Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Uruguay — the so-called "support
group" — joined their four Contadora counterparts in intensified talks
to usher the divided Central American nations into agreement on a for
mula for peace on the isthmus.
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto insisted on obtaining a
clear condemnation of the Reagan proposal for more aid to the rebels,
called contras after the Spanish word for counter-revolutionaries, ac
cording to officials in the discussions. A Nicaraguan diplomat said the
Sandinista government also maintained its earlier refusals to sign a Con
tadora treaty without a U.S. commitment to end support for the insur
gency, which he said was the main obstacle to peace in Central America.
Economic reforms begin in France
PARIS — France's new right-wing government yesterday took its first
steps toward fulfilling promises to relax state controls over the economy
following a controversial devaluation of the French franc.
The devaluation of the franc, agreed to at a weekend meeting of
European finance ministers in the Netherlands, formed part of a pack
age of measures designed to boost confidence in the French economy.
The finance ministers, meeting in the town of Ootmarsum, agreed to a
3 percent devaluation of the franc in addition to an equivalent upward
revaluation of the West German mark. This formed part of the first gen
eral realignment of the seven currencies within the coordinated
European Monetary System in three years.
The devaluation and a package of other measures were the first major
economic decision made by the new government here since the narrow
right-wing victory in parliamentary elections March 16. French com
mentators interpreted the move as a political gesture designed to win the
new government freedom for economic maneuvers while it attempts to
liberalize the economy. The package included the reduction of exchange
controls, cuts in public expenditure and freeing of price restrictions.
Military linked to kidnapping ring
SAN SALVADOR. El Salvador — Four high-ranking Salvadoran
army officers are among people being investigated here as suspected
members of a kidnapping ring that abducted members of the country's
wealthy families for ransoms totaling several million dollars, sources
close to the case said yesterday.
The sources, asking not to be identified by name, said they believe the
armed forces high command is willing for the first time ever to see
active-duty commissioned officers arrested and prosecuted for kidnap
ping because of pressure from well-to-do families whose interests the
military has traditionally protected here.
A source close to the case said the military officers as well as the
civilians under investigation have all had close ties with Roberto
D'Aubuisson, a retired intelligence service officer and former leader of
the rightist Arena party whom U.S. officials have accused of links with
past activities of right-wing death squads here.
In the early 1980s, thousands of students, peasants, religious workers,
labor and leftist political leaders were killed or disappeared, their fates
blamed on rightist paramilitary groups believed to have been linked to
the military. No commissioned officer ever has been tried for a political
crime here.
Last week, authorities announced the arrest of two people in the kid
napping investigation, including former Lt. Rodolfo Lopez Sibrian, a
one-time National Guard intelligence officer who was implicated in the
machine-gun slaying of two American labor advisers and a Salvadoran
land reform official at the Sheraton Hotel here in 1981.
Police also hold Lopez Sibrian's father-in-law. Orlando Llovera Bal
lete. a furniture manufacturer, rancher and member of a well-known
family that has been active in the Arena party.
U.S., Saudis seek oil price stability
DH AH R AN. Saudi Arabia — Vice President George Bush and Saudi
King Fahd agreed yesterday on the need to re-establish stability in the
chaotic oil market, but they failed to agree on a desirable price for a bar
rel of oil or on any common measures the two governments might take
to stop plunging oil prices.
Following a two-hour meeting between the two leaders at the king's
palace here, a senior Administration official said the two had held a gen
eral exchange of views on oil and other regional issues during which the
vice president explained the Administration's concern that falling oil
prices had become a threat to U.S. national interests.
Bush made it clear that Saudi interests and U.S. interests are "not
identical" on oil prices, the official said, adding that the talks were
"open" and that positions were "frankly put."
