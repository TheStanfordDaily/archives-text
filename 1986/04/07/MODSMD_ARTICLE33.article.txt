### 
BERLIN — Police began a painstaking search
yesterday of rubble from a midtown West Berlin

More than 70 persons, most of them in their 20s.
remained hospitalized, suffering from burns, bro
ken limbs and ruptured eardrums from the blast,
which ripped through the crowded club about 2
•a.m. Saturday.

said that injuries to the 26 Americans still hospi
talized included "some broken and some missing
limbs."
A spokesman at the Landstuhl Army Regional
Medical Center near Frankfurt, said that 19 of the
25 victims originally taken there returned yester
day to West Berlin.
U.S. and West German authorities have both
made it clear that they believe the bombing wits

politically motivated, aimed at the American ser
vicemen. but there still was no hard evidence to
link the attack with any specific group.
The bombing, which claimed the life of a 21-
year-old American soldier and a 29-year-old
Turkish woman, followed threats by Libya's leader.
Col. Moammar Khadafi. that every American was
a target as a result of last month s confrontation be
tween U.S. and Libyan forces in the Gulf of Sidra.
In recent days, pro-Libyan groups have claimed
resonsibility for the bombing of a TWA plane over
Greece and a Los Angeles-bound Mexican airliner.
And in Paris, two Libyan diplomats, accused of ties
to elements planning attacks against American tar
gets, were expelled from France.
Reflecting the depth of official suspicion here,
the West German Foreign Ministry yesterday an
nounced that it has formed a special unit to follow
up any police evidence that might link the discot
heque bombinu to a foreien government.

Dieter Piete, the West Berlin police official
heading the investigation into the bombing, said
that a total of six telephone calls have been
received claiming responsibility for the attack on
behalf of various political organizations.
However, he said the claims contained only
widely known information and were most likely
false.
"They just make our job more difficult," he said.
During the course of the day yesterday, police
carted away tons of rubble from the La Belle club,
located on the ground floor of a six-story buidling
just off Breslauer Platz in the Schoeneberg district
of the city.

ing.
Police also said that more than 100 persons in
and around the club at the time of the bombing had
