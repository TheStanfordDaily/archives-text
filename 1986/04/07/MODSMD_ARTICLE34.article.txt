# Casey assails Soviets for subversion

WASHINGTON — CIA Director
William Casey said yesterday that So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has
launched "an intensified effort" to
secure "bridgeheads" for spreading
subversion and extending Soviet in
fluence in the Middle East, Central
America and Africa.
Speaking here to the annual con
ference of the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee — the pro-Israel
lobby — Casey said the Soviets have
armed Libya and Syria in an effort to
put a squeeze on Israel and the
moderate Arab states in the region.
The Reagan Administration has
used Casey's agency to give covert
support to insurgent forces in
Nicaragua and Angola, and President
Reagan and other Administration of
ficials have frequently blasted the
Soviets while lobbying for aid to the
contras, as the Nicaraguan counter
revolutionaries are known.
But Casey larely makes public
speeches. And an equally rare public
attack on Gorbachev personally, by
any Administration official, comes at
a time when the Reagan Administra
tion and the Soviet leader have been
jockeying over the details of another

summit conference this year.
Casey, in his speech and in frank
answers to questions from the group,
also said:
• Saudi Arabia has paid "lip service"
to U.S. concerns about its funding of
the Palestine Liberation Organiza

tion. He said Saudi leaders, now host
ing Vice President Bush, support the
PLO and other terrorist-linked
groups "for reasons of fear, intimida
tion and pursuing their own foreign
policy objectives."
• The Sandinista government of

Nicaragua started an all-out cam
paign two months ago to destroy the
U.S.-backed contras, including
driving thousands of Miskito Indians
across the border into Honduras
during the past week.
• Cuban troops and Soviet advisers in
Angola are "feverishly preparing a
campaign, likely to be launched
during this month, designed to wipe
out forces resisting the Marxist gov
ernment of Angola."
But Casey saved some of his
strongest rhetoric for Gorbachev and
the Soviets. "We have a new Soviet
leader, Mr. Gorbachev, and already a
hallmark of his regime is an intensi
fied effort to nail down and cement
these bridgeheads, make them per
manent," he said.
The CIA director said the United
States and its allies have succeeded in
many places in slowing or halting So
viet aggression. But he said, "Today
we are witnessing particularly inten
sive efforts to tilt the overall strategic
balance against the West."
"We Americans have failed to see
the interrelationships" between the
Soviet efforts in different parts of the
world, he said.
