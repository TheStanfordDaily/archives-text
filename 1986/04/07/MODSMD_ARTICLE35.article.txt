Expert discusses Khadafi
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion's leading expert on counter-terrorism said
yesterday that the rising death toll in Europe
caused by terrorist bombings should disprove the
widely held view of U.S. allies that Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafi is strictly "an American
obsession."
"There are those who say that this Administra
tion is obsessed with Libya, and that we're
blowing the whole thing up out of proportion —
that there isn't a serious threat there," said
Robert Oakley, who heads the State Depart
ment's counter-terrorism office.
In an interview on CBS' "Face the Nation," he
acknowledged that Administration efforts to
clamp down on terrorism two years ago were un
dercut by the suspicion among European leaders
that President Reagan was focusing too much at
tention on Khadafi.
"It didn't succeed because of the amount of in
ternational cooperation has not been great
enough," he said. "People sort of said, 'Oh this is
an American crusade, it's an American obses
sion." "
But Oakley asserted that an escalating death
toll in Europe over the past few years, combined

with two new bombings within the last week —
which the Administration has characterized as a
part of Khadafi's "master plan" for terrorism —
have demonstrated to the Europeans that the
threat extends beyond the sphere of the United
States.
"This is not something that is bilateral," he
said. "It is not the United States versus Libya.
Think of the effect this is having upon the
Europeans. We're in this together, and our ob
jective is to get the Europeans to work with us to
do more about this threat, whether it be from
Libya or Syria or Iran or elsewhere."
McFarlane on terrorism
LOS ANGELES — Former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane called yesterday on
the United States to join with its allies in devel
oping a covert anti-terrorism force that would in
filtrate terrorist organizations and make pre
emptive military strikes against terrorist training
camps.
Speaking at a conference on terrorism in Los
Angeles, McFarlane said that the clandestine
force would track down and penetrate terrorist
groups in an effort to "strike at the heart" of

what he and others characterized as expanding
worldwide attacks against American civilians.
"The best way to collect information on terror
ists is to penetrate terrorist organizations," said
McFarlane, who mentioned training camps in
Libya as a prime target for the proposed covert
activity. "Violence must on occasion be a compo
nent of an effective strategy."
McFarlane said such a covert military and in
telligence force would be subject to confidential
Congressional approval, would include "central
participation" by U.S. allies and would be geared
toward acts of self-defense. He said the force
would be aimed at groups in countries with gov
ernments that sponsor or condone terrorism.
Later, he named Libya, Iran and Syria as such
countries.
"Unless the terrorists know there really is a
cost for harming Americans, then terrorism is
going to be cheap to them," McFarlane said in an
interview after his formal remarks. "By and large
these people are bullies who are not capable of a
sustained high level of violence."
When asked if such a covert group exists now
or is being planned by the Reagan Administra
tion, McFarlane, who resigned from the Admin
istration in December, said, "I don't think so."
