Cause of fire sought
SAN FRANCISCO — Local and federal in
vestigators combined forces yesterday to try to
trace the cause of an explosion and fire that
consumed an industrial complex and resulted in
at least $10 million damage.
Meanwhile, crews continued pumping
thousands of gallons of water from the Hunter's
Point area site where water in some spots stood
five feet deep.
Deputy Fire Chief Richard Crispen said a
physical search for seven Bayview Industrial Park
employees reported missing since the blaze will
get underway today, after enough water has been
pumped from a basement-like area that was un
derneath the complex.
Frank Sanders of a 10-member federal Bureau
of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms task force
helping with the investigation said agents are
checking out a report that the explosion was acci
dentally triggered by a spark igniting atomized
vapor from a high-pressure lacquer sprayer being
used in a carpentry shop.
According to Crispen. the space occupied by
Borsian Cabinets may have been where the ex
plosion occurred.
"That's the area where some individuals are
still missing, and it's the area where the most
serious injuries occurred — they are the ones in
critical condition," he said.
Randv Bradesku. 29. a motorcycle mechanic

who was eating lunch in his basement apartment
next to Borsian's, said about 60 antique clocks
blew off the wall with the force of the explosion.
He said he scrambled outside and saw badly
burned workers fleeing the scene. "This guy
came out with all his clothes burned off of him,
no hair on his head and no skin on his face,"
Bradesku said. "The ends of his fingers had ex
ploded open. Four or five more came out with cut
faces, singed hair and their clothes were all
burned up."
Six lire victims remained at San Francisco
General Hospital yesterday. A nursing super
visor said two are in serious condition, and four
reported to be stable .
The Red Cross has announced that today it will
begin searching for shelter for several artists who
were burned out of the studios where they
worked and lived at the industrial park.
Mayor Dianne Feinstein vowed. "We'll do
anything we can to be of help." But she added
that she didn't know what city relief efforts might
involve.
Moon linked to quake
LOS ANGELES — Southern California
should expect a major earthquake soon, say two
local scientists who suggest that the gravitational
pull of the sun and moon may have helped trigger
great quakes here in the past.

Astronomer Steven Kilston and geophysgcist
Leon Knopoff say Southern California has en
tered a time when the pull of sun and moon is
greatest on the San Andreas Fault, and the most
vulnerable time appears to be November 1987.
"But we're not predicting an earthquake in
November of 1987," Knopoff emphasized.
They said 10 of the 13 major earthquakes in
the area in the last five decades occurred near
sunrise or sunset, when there is a strong influence
of solar gravity. Also, most occurred in nearly
18.6-year intervals that coincide with the nor
thernmost position of the moon.
While conceding they base their conclusions on
meager historical data, they say tidal forces from
the moon and sun may provide what Kilston
called the "last-straw push" needed for jarring
loose an earthquake.
Their findings were published in a 1983 article
in Nature, a British science journal, and have
generated several studies since then testing the
theory.
Today's weather
Showers and isolated thunderstorms today
with highs in the upper 50s and 60s. Light winds.
The clouds will be clearing tonight as fair weather
is expected tomorrow. High likelihood of Lem
ley's electrocution.
