# Columbae to offer refugees sanctuary
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
At a press conference today, students at
Columbae house will officially declare their
residence a public sanctuary for refugees fleeing
violence in El Salvador and Guatemala.
In a statement released yesterday, residents
of Columbae, a campus cooperative, said they
feel it is their moral responsibility to aid people
who have been oppressed and have nowhere to
go.
As a sanctuary, Columbae would help
refugees in "every possible way," the statement
said. Students would aid refugees by working
with already established refugee social service
programs to gather material aid and raising bail
money to be distributed throughout the refugee
community.
In addition, Columbae is planning to house
refugees in its residence.
But Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said the students cannot actually declare a
campus residence a sanctuary, although he ap
plauded Columbae's concern.
Lyons said "It (Columbae) is not their house.
They are committing something that's not their
own/'
Lyons stressed that he feels there are many
ways besides providing housing that would be
more appropriate for a student living group to
be involved. He said students could support
East and South Bay sanctuary convents or do
churchwork, tutoring, healthcare and fundrais
ing.
Caroline Paul, a Columbae resident and one

of the original supporters of a sanctuary pro
gram here, said. "I hope the University doesn't
reduce a real moral human rights issue to a
housing policyissue.
"We don't want to emphasize housing
' refugees. The other aspects of our being a sanc
tuary are just as important. But there is no rea
son why housing a refugee should he illegal,"
Paul said.
Lyons refused to speculate on possible Uni
versity response if refugees are housed at
Columbae. However, he said, individuals living
in University-owned housing such its Columbae
sign agreements that they will not take in guests
for more than three days. Failure to abide by
this or any other residence policy could lead to
loss of housing.
According to a statement issued by house res
idents, oppressive regimes in Central America
have killed 60,000 El Salvadorans since 1979
and more than 50,000 Guatemalans since 198 I.
Violence has caused more than one million Sal
vadoran and Guatemalan citizens to go into
exile, the statement said.
U.S. government statistics estimate that half a
million of these have entered the United States.
This includes tens of thousands in the Bay Area
and hundreds in East Palo Alto, according to
the statement.
Since 1982, over 250 places of worship, as
well as many cities and colleges, have declared
themselves sanctuaries. Included in this group
are over a dozen churches in the Bay Area, the
cities of New York, San Francisco and Los An
geles and nine University of California
campuses.
