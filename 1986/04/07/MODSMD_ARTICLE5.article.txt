# Davis accepts lowa basketball position
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
Tom Davis' career has gone full
circle.
The Wisconsin native started his
career as a prep coach in western Illi
nois, and then he headed east for a
six-year stint at Lafayette College
and a five-year stay at Boston Col
lege. He had spent the last four
seasons out west here on the Farm.
But at 4:30 yesterday afternoon,
Davis announced that he will return
to the Midwest to accept the position
of head basketball coach at the Uni
versity of lowa.
Yesterday in an phone interview
with The Daily from his hotel room in
lowa City, Davis was asked why he
had taken the post. "I think the fact
that 1 am from the Midwest," en
couraged him to make the move, he
said.


Tom Davis has coached his last game for the Card
inal. Yesterday, he announced that he will lead the
University of lowa next year.
Davis was given a five-year con
tract with a starting salary of $75,000
a year, a figure that could go much
higher with added revenues from a
TV show, a radio program and a bas
ketball camp. He will succeed George
Raveling, who recently accepted the
head coaching job at USC.
"We're elated," lowa Athletic
Director Bump Elliot said. "We think
that Tom is an outstanding person,
and we're very pleased about it."

Davis said: "I leave with a great
deal of regret. I'm leaving some ter
rific guys that I've enjoyed a lot.
That's one of the regrets that I have,
that I wasn't able to speak with them
personally.
"The one thing I want to let them
know, is how much I care for them.
You could not get a much better
group."
The Stanford players expressed
surprise and dismay upon hearing of
Davis' departure.
"I'm disappointed to hear he's
going because I've played three years
under him," junior guard Novian
Whitsitt said. "I really wanted him to

stay. (But) he has to do what he has
to do. He's a coach, that's his job."
"I was kind of surprised,'' fresh
man guard Terry Taylor said. "We
had the making of a team that's start
ing to come back. I was kind of
shocked to see that he would leave
like that. I'm probably a little angry."
"Changing to a new system would
be kind of tough," freshman center
Derek Bruton said. "I kind of figured
he would stay here all along."
In lowa, Davis will inherit a
talented young group of Hawkeyes
which finished sixth in the Big Ten
Conference hut still qualified for the
NCAA tournament.
"I've known Tom for a long time
and l think he's an excellent coach."
fellow Big Ten Coach Lou Henson of
Illinois said. "They (the Hawkeyes)
have excellent talent. They will he
picked to come in no lower than third
in the league."
Davis said of the lowa program,
"Everybody that's talked to me about
it has raved about it." The Hawkeyes
boast young forwards Roy Marble
and Al Lorenzen, and superstar
recruit Anthony Pendleton is waiting
in the wings.
Davis beat out a top-flight field of
candidates including head coaches
Norm Stewart of Missouri and Jim
Brandenburg of Wyoming and lowa
assistants Brian Hammel and Ken
Righter.
Davis has offered assistant coach
ing jobs at lowa to all his former as
sistants at Stanford.
"I spoke with Coach Davis today,
and he offered me the position as as
sistant at the University of lowa,"

Stanford Asst. Coach Bruce Pearl
said. "There will be tears in my eyes
when I say goodbye to some of those
players, and yet my loyalty is to
Coach Davis."
It is not known whether or not
Davis' other assistants. Kermit Wash
ington and Gary Close, will join him
in lowa.
Davis was recently disappointed
when top recruit Chris Munk of Rior
dan High School was denied admis
sion to Stanford, but yesterday he dis
counted the effects of losing perhaps
his best prospect ever at Stanford.
"We all understand the difficulty of
that decision," Davis said of the
Munk case. "I respect the job the ad
missions people have done."
It is also uncertain whether Munk
will follow Davis to lowa City. Munk
was flying home from a prep all star
game in Chicago last night, but his
sister Hanne said, "I don't know if he
is going to visit lowa. That's 50-50."
While a successor for Davis has not
been named, possible candidates in
clude Paul Westhead. former coach
of the NBA Los Angeles Lakers and
now the head coach at Loyola
Marymount, and Jerry Pimm, former
University of Utah coach.

Davis beat out a top-flight field of
candidates including head coaches
Norm Stewart of Missouri and Jim
Brandenburg of Wyoming and lowa
assistants Brian Hammel and Ken
Righter.
Davis has offered assistant coach
ing jobs at lowa to all his former as
sistants at Stanford.
"I spoke with Coach Davis today,
and he offered me the position as as
sistant at the University of lowa,"

Stanford Asst. Coach Bruce Pearl
said. "There will be tears in my eyes
when I say goodbye to some of those
players, and yet my loyalty is to
Coach Davis."
It is not known whether or not
Davis' other assistants. Kermit Wash
ington and Gary Close, will join him
in lowa.
Davis was recently disappointed
when top recruit Chris Munk of Rior
dan High School was denied admis
sion to Stanford, but yesterday he dis
counted the effects of losing perhaps
his best prospect ever at Stanford.
"We all understand the difficulty of
that decision," Davis said of the
Munk case. "I respect the job the ad
missions people have done."
It is also uncertain whether Munk
will follow Davis to lowa City. Munk
was flying home from a prep all star
game in Chicago last night, but his
sister Hanne said, "I don't know if he
is going to visit lowa. That's 50-50."
While a successor for Davis has not
been named, possible candidates in
clude Paul Westhead. former coach
of the NBA Los Angeles Lakers and
now the head coach at Loyola
Marymount, and Jerry Pimm, former
University of Utah coach.
Tom Davis' career has gone full
circle.
The Wisconsin native started his
career as a prep coach in western Illi
nois, and then he headed east for a
six-year stint at Lafayette College
and a five-year stay at Boston Col
lege. He had spent the last four
seasons out west here on the Farm.
But at 4:30 yesterday afternoon,
Davis announced that he will return
to the Midwest to accept the position
of head basketball coach at the Uni
versity of lowa.
Yesterday in an phone interview
with The Daily from his hotel room in
lowa City, Davis was asked why he
had taken the post. "I think the fact
that 1 am from the Midwest," en
couraged him to make the move, he
said.


Tom Davis has coached his last game for the Card
inal. Yesterday, he announced that he will lead the
University of lowa next year.
Davis was given a five-year con
tract with a starting salary of $75,000
a year, a figure that could go much
higher with added revenues from a
TV show, a radio program and a bas
ketball camp. He will succeed George
Raveling, who recently accepted the
head coaching job at USC.
"We're elated," lowa Athletic
Director Bump Elliot said. "We think
that Tom is an outstanding person,
and we're very pleased about it."

Davis said: "I leave with a great
deal of regret. I'm leaving some ter
rific guys that I've enjoyed a lot.
That's one of the regrets that I have,
that I wasn't able to speak with them
personally.
"The one thing I want to let them
know, is how much I care for them.
You could not get a much better
group."
The Stanford players expressed
surprise and dismay upon hearing of
Davis' departure.
"I'm disappointed to hear he's
going because I've played three years
under him," junior guard Novian
Whitsitt said. "I really wanted him to

stay. (But) he has to do what he has
to do. He's a coach, that's his job."
"I was kind of surprised,'' fresh
man guard Terry Taylor said. "We
had the making of a team that's start
ing to come back. I was kind of
shocked to see that he would leave
like that. I'm probably a little angry."
"Changing to a new system would
be kind of tough," freshman center
Derek Bruton said. "I kind of figured
he would stay here all along."
In lowa, Davis will inherit a
talented young group of Hawkeyes
which finished sixth in the Big Ten
Conference hut still qualified for the
NCAA tournament.
"I've known Tom for a long time
and l think he's an excellent coach."
fellow Big Ten Coach Lou Henson of
Illinois said. "They (the Hawkeyes)
have excellent talent. They will he
picked to come in no lower than third
in the league."
Davis said of the lowa program,
"Everybody that's talked to me about
it has raved about it." The Hawkeyes
boast young forwards Roy Marble
and Al Lorenzen, and superstar
recruit Anthony Pendleton is waiting
in the wings.
