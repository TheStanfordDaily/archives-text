# Universities call for fund reform
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
In a letter to the California congressional delega
tion, the presidents of four major California uni
versities, including University President Donald
Kennedy, have protested "earmarking" of federal
research funds because such practices "undermine
the merit review process and, by extension, the
long-term health of academic research efforts."
Kennedy, David Gardner of the University of
California, Marvin Goldberger of the California In
stitute of Technology and James Zumberge of the
University of Southern California have joined in an
effort to eliminate "pork-barreling" of research
funds in California universities. Kennedy said.
"We've been trying to stem the tide of this
process." Kennedy said in an interview last week.
He said the Association of American Universities,
an organization representing over 50 research uni
versities, has agreed not to accept "earmarked"
federal research grants. The president of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences also has expressed sup
port for the sentiments expressed in the letter.
Stanford has never received pork-barreled re
search grants, according to Kennedy.
Pork-barreling is a process by which Congress
gives federal research money to certain institutions

without using the customary competitive review
process in which "individual research projects are
evaluated by experts in the field -and judged on
their scientific and technological merits."
"This process ensures that our limited federal
funds available for research are spent on the most
promising projects," the letter said.
"At a time when all of us are acutely aware of
budgetary constraints as well as the importance of
science and technology in maintaining our place in
the world economy, it becomes all the more impor
tant to protect the integrity of the merit review
process so that projects of the greatest value to the
nation receive funding," the letter said.
"It is essential that the projects compete, and the
most meritorious ones are funded," Kennedy said.
"In the long run, it's very important to preserve
public confidence in science." Kennedy added.
Pork-barreling of federal research could con
ceivably make taxpayers feel as if their money is
not directed toward the most meritorious projects.
The controversy is not over who determines in
what areas research will be done. "The government
can choose the categories of research which it
chooses to support. The question is how the re
sources within that category are allocated," Ken
nedy said.

In the letter, the presidents said, "The root cause
of the problem — the capital crisis affecting aca
demic research institutions — should he addressed
and remedied. In the meantime, however, we urge
you and your colleagues to do all you can to sup
port the existing merit review system and resist at
tempts to earmark funds for research proposals
that have not received competitive, merit-based
review.
"Much of our national scientific and technologi
cal pre-eminence is due to our system of awarding
research funds on the basis of open, vigorous com
petition. . . . This process insures that our limited
federal funds available for research are spent on
the most promising projects," the letter said.
The amount of federal research money available
has been on the decline because. "In recent years
the convergence of two historical trends — the 'ab
sence since 1968 of of federal funds for facilities
construction and renovation and rising research
costs — has created a serious capital shortage for
colleges and universities," the letter said.
"Consequently, some institutions have appealed
directly to Congress for badly needed funds. These
requests for special earmarked funds, while under
standable. undermine the merit review process and,
by extension, the long-term health of our academic
research efforts." the letter said.
