The preliminary hearing on charges of sexual battery
and false imprisonment brought against Stanford's
retired chief dermatologist may last until August, ac
cording to the deputy district attorney handling the
case.
"We've been going to court every other Friday,"
Lane Liroff said. "At this rate, the hearing could last
until June, July, even August."
Dr. Eugene Farber has been accused of performing
an unnecessary pelvic examination on a female patient,
fondling her breasts, taking her into his private office
and trying to kiss and embrace her, according to court
records.
The false imprisonment charge stems from the ac
cusation that Farber held the woman in his office
against her will.
The Mountain View woman visited Farber Nov. 28,
1984, at the Stanford Medical Center for treatment of
psoriasis, a skin ailment affecting her feet.
The preliminary hearing, which began March 10, is
held to determine if there is enough evidence against

been four court sessions in the past month, with the
next one scheduled for April 18.
At the most recent session, held Friday, the woman
was cross-examined by Farber" s attorney. Tom Nolan.
The questioning centered on her medical history, ac
cording to Liroff.
"In my opinion, nothing, abosulutely nothing, of im
portance happened today," Liroff said Friday after
noon.
Nolan could not be reached for comment.
Nolan has called the woman mentally disturbed,
saying her accusations against Farber are "absurd and
totally false."
At a Jan. 18, 1985 arraignment, Farber pleaded in
nocent to charges of sexual battery and false imprison
ment, felonies that carry a maximum penalty of four
years in prison.
Farber, chairman of the Dermatology Department
here since its establishment in 1959, retired in Septem
ber. He cited health problems and demands on his time
and energy by the court case as reasons for his decision
to retire.
Currently at the Psoriasis Research Institute in Palo
Alto, Farber had been with Stanford since 1948.
