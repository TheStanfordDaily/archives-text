# Union protests layoffs
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Members of the United Stanford
Workers (USW) picketed in front of
the home of the director of Informa
tion Technologies Services for an
hour Saturday afternoon, protesting
the layoff of 10 union workers.
Union officials claim the layoffs
were partially politically motivated to
undermine the union and represent a
general disregard for workers on the
part of Stanford managers.
ITS Director Edward Shaw said the
allegations the layoffs were politically
motivated were "totally untrue. . . .
We followed the union contract word
for word."
Four pressworkers and six data
entry workers at ITS lost their jobs,
and union officials said extensive re
search into the political orientation of
pressworkers was done in order to
fire the most active union members.
One of the four pressworkers who
was laid off, USW Vice President
Aloha Kaylor, said University offi
cials interviewed the workers in the
months before the layoffs about their

union activism.
Another of the laid-off press
workers, Don Fernandez, was a
member of the Affirmative Action
Committee, while a third, Romero
Qurioz, was a member of the USW's
Strike Preparation Committee.
Kaylor said the University's reason
for laying off the four pressworkers
was inconsistent. She said the Univer
sity's motivation for firing Fernandez
and Qurioz, who had each worked for
the University for at least 10 years,
was that the two were unable to do
complex color printing work. She said
she was hired to do such work and is
being fired along with them.
Shaw said the layoffs of the press
workers were economically
motivated. The pressworking division
of ITS was losing money and needed
to "break even," he said.
Kaylor said the day she and the
others were fired, a pressworker who
had been working at Stanford for
only two years was promoted above
the others, making him ineligible to
be laid off.
The promoted worker is white, and
Kaylor described him as "waffling"

with respect to his union loyalty.
Shaw said the worker had recently
completed a training program which
made him eligible for the promotion.
The decision to select the worker for
the training program was made "long
before we knew about the firing," he
added.
The layoffs of the six data entry
workers were required because of a
new computer system being used by
the University which allows more
data entry to be done on remote ter
minals, thus reducing the need for
pure data entry workers.
Union officials said the employees
should be retrained and rehired
rather than fired outright. The
retraining necessary to make the
workers hireable in the new clerical
postions is minimal, they said.
Shaw said University departments
make hiring decisions individually.
The provision allowing laid off
workers to "bump" less experienced
workers in other departments did not
apply in this situation since ITS is the
only department which employs
pressworkers and data workers, Shaw
added.
