# Professor criticizes Stanford
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Political Science Prof. John Manley
yesterday sent an open letter to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
denouncing an "unresponsive" Stan
ford administration that "seems more
concerned with expansion and na
tional rankings than human values."
The professor lashed out against
University policies, saying that
"Stanford acts more and more like a
big business." He cited the adminis
tration's anti-labor reputation, in
transigence on the divestment issue
and unwillingness to acknowledge the
validity of critics' arguments.
He said he wrote the letter to spur
debate on campus.
Manley also is protesting a lower
than-average salary raise, charging
that the administration deliberately
discriminated against him for speak
ing out against alleged political activi
ties at the Hoover Institution.
He said he received a poor salary
increase in 1984-85, a year after the
Hoover controversy began. "The way
my salary was handled exemplifies
questionable policies currently in ef
fect at Stanford," he said in the letter.
He expanded on his statements in
an interview last night, saying he went
public with his salary dispute "to
provoke interest and concern and
debate," but not with the expectation
of winning a greater salary.
"Stanford's administration is
saying to professors, 'We want to be
No. 1 — give us more publications,
more prizes,' Manley said. "The ad
ministration is getting increasingly
oppressive. Teaching is increasingly
subordinated to (research).
"This raises questions about what
kind of university Stanford is, and
whether we want to be that kind of
university."
/ Much of Manley's letter cites
♦ evidence for his contention that the

current administration causes
"conflict between the ideal of the
University and the situation at Stan
ford."
• He said Kennedy has held his basic
argument against divestment despite
police violence and the suspension of
civil liberties in South Africa, and
despite the protests within the Stan
ford community.
• He quoted critics of the administra
