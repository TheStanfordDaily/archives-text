# Professor criticizes Stanford
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Political Science Prof. John Manley
yesterday sent an open letter to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
denouncing an "unresponsive" Stan
ford administration that "seems more
concerned with expansion and na
tional rankings than human values."
The professor lashed out against
University policies, saying that
"Stanford acts more and more like a
big business." He cited the adminis
tration's anti-labor reputation, in
transigence on the divestment issue
and unwillingness to acknowledge the
validity of critics' arguments.
He said he wrote the letter to spur
debate on campus.
Manley also is protesting a lower
than-average salary raise, charging
that the administration deliberately
discriminated against him for speak
ing out against alleged political activi
ties at the Hoover Institution.
He said he received a poor salary
increase in 1984-85, a year after the
Hoover controversy began. "The way
my salary was handled exemplifies
questionable policies currently in ef
fect at Stanford," he said in the letter.
He expanded on his statements in
an interview last night, saying he went
public with his salary dispute "to
provoke interest and concern and
debate," but not with the expectation
of winning a greater salary.
"Stanford's administration is
saying to professors, 'We want to be
No. 1 — give us more publications,
more prizes,' Manley said. "The ad
ministration is getting increasingly
oppressive. Teaching is increasingly
subordinated to (research).
"This raises questions about what
kind of university Stanford is, and
whether we want to be that kind of
university."

current administration causes
"conflict between the ideal of the
University and the situation at Stan
ford."

argument against divestment despite
police violence and the suspension of
civil liberties in South Africa, and
despite the protests within the Stan
ford community.
• He quoted critics of the administra

tion who note that Stanford is "no
longer the idealistic, free-thinking
academic institution that we should
be," and complain that the University
is "increasingly more authoritarian
under (Kennedy's) regime."
• He assailed the administration's un
willingness to encourage campus
wide debate on weapons research is
sues and on the creation of the Center
for Integrated Systems, which he said
deepens University connections with
the military-industrial complex.
• He questioned the University's
policies on bringing student-run
policies under administrative control
and firing gifted teachers for failing to
publish sufficient "world-class" work.
• He criticized ties between the Uni
versity and the Hoover Institution.
"Fifteen-hundred students and
over one hundred faculty sign peti
tions expressing concern about ties
between Stanford and the Hoover In
stitution," he wrote Kennedy. "You
announce that we should get closer to
Hoover and appoint committees
laden with Hoover supporters.
Hearings are held but behind closed
doors."
Manley, 47, is a tenured professor
who has been on the Stanford faculty
since 1971. He was chairman of the
Political Science Department from
1977 to 1980.

He said last night that he appealed
his low salary increase to Provost
James Rosse about a year ago, and
said he felt now that he should take
up the issue with Kennedy because
"things are not likely to get better on
their own."
He noted in the letter that although
he could not produce a "smoking
gun" to prove that his low salary in
crease was linked to his outspoken
views, he was not alone in his
opinion. He said former department
chairman Heinz Eulau had objected
to Manley's low raise, viewing it as
"politically punitive."
Because of the University's salary
discrimination, Manley said, "I felt as
if in the future I would have to think
twice before speaking out. Probably
no one intended such an effect, but it
was nonetheless produced."
An aide to Kennedy said yesterday
afternoon that the president had not
yet read Manley's letter.

said he felt now that he should take
up the issue with Kennedy because
"things are not likely to get better on
their own."
He noted in the letter that although
he could not produce a "smoking
gun" to prove that his low salary in
crease was linked to his outspoken
views, he was not alone in his
opinion. He said former department
chairman Heinz Eulau had objected
to Manley's low raise, viewing it as
"politically punitive."
Because of the University's salary
discrimination, Manley said, "I felt as
if in the future I would have to think
twice before speaking out. Probably
no one intended such an effect, but it
was nonetheless produced."
An aide to Kennedy said yesterday
afternoon that the president had not
yet read Manley's letter.
