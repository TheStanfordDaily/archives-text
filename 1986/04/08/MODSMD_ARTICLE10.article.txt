# Study reveals qualities giving business success
## 
### STUART BLOCK 
The personal qualities that ap
pear to have a positive effect on
Stanford MBA graduates include
an outgoing, ascending personality,
a desire to persuade, talk and work
with people and a need for power.
These conclusions, part of an ex
tensive 20-year study focusing on
the careers of former Stanford
Graduate School of Business stu
dents, were released March 21 by
Emeritus Business School Prof.
Thomas Harrell and Bernard Al
pert, a professor at the San Fran
cisco State University Business
School.
The researchers, who conducted
the first study ever to trace Stan
ford MBA success over such an ex
tended period, based their findings
on detailed in-school testing sup
plemented by five-year follow-up
surveys. Approximately half the
GSB graduates from the classes of
1961, 1962 and 1963 responded to
the survey.

Harrell and Alpert told the Uni
versity News Service that while
there are no "certain passports to
success . .. the variable found con
sistently related to management
success (as measured by compensa
tion) was the personality trait of so
cial extroversion or sociability."
The researchers found that high
scores on business aptitude tests did
not necessarily result in career suc
cess. Among those admitted to the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness, results of standardized admis
sions tests were found to be
negatively correlated with high ear
ning and general management
work.
According to the researchers,
class selection while attending the
GSB is another link that connects
business graduates with career
achievement. Courses such as per
suasion, negotiation, presentation,
selling and other forms of speaking
were prevalent among the most
successful MBAs.
Those students with the highest

earnings had undergraduate majors
in economics, English and business.
Engineering majors began
relatively high on the corporate
ladder, but started to fall behind 10
to 15 years after graduation.
"A generalist appears more
likely to reach the top than a spe
cialist," the researchers said, add
ing that "whether the MBA reaches
a higher level because of a broader
background, we don't know."
Harrell said one of the most in
teresting phenomena revealed in
the survey was the tendency of
MBAs to move from large to small
businesses.
In an interview with The Daily,
Harrell said, "Since the aim of
Stanford's GSB is to educate
people to be general managers of
important organizations, (the
school) is not getting what it said it
wanted to get." Instead, many
MBAs are seeking self
employment in smaller business
ventures.
