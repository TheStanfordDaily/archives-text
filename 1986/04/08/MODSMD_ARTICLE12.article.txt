## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Don't cut varsity sports 
### 
Someone should take the panic button out of Stan
ford Athletic Director Andy Geiger's hands before
someone else gets hurt.
Last month, with a projected four-year deficit of
$2.3 million staring him in the face, Geiger blinked.
Rather than organize a plan for reducing expenses and
raising money, he unexpectedly hacked the operational
and scholarship funding for five low-cost sports —
wrestling, men's and women's fencing, women's field
hockey and softball — solving virtually nothing and an
gering a good-sized slice of the Stanford community.
The cuts will save an estimated $200,000 to
$250,000 a year in operating expenses and, eventually,
another $200,000 in scholarship money. Compared to
the Athletic Department's overall budget — in particu
lar, the millions spent annually on football and basket
ball — these cuts amount to very little.
And they lead nowhere. The more logical way of
putting the department back on an even financial keel
would be to increase revenues through ticket sales and

TV contracts (a course of action which Geiger said
recently that he plans to take.) Geiger's first move
should have been to rebuild the department, not to
tear it down.
If the cuts were part of a well-conceived financial
health plan, they would be easier to swallow; as it is,
they appear to many to have been unfairly arbitrary.
The toughest thing to swallow is that Geiger does not
rule out further axings among the 23 remaining varsity
sports.
"Either our base of support grows or we must cut
back further," he said shortly after announcing his
decision. "And at this time I see no indication that our
base of support is growing."
Geiger needs to get a plan for reducing his budget
deficit, and he needs to explain it to the Stanford com
munity. He must bring financial responsibility to the
Athletic Department, but he must not forget his re
sponsibility to Stanford students in the process.
