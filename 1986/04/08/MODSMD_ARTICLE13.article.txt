## Draft guidelines for frats 
### 
Luke Cole must be praised for the amazing piece of in
trospection and self-evaluation put forth in his viewpoint
which concluded that "the fraternity system at Stanford
should be abolished" (Daily, April 4). He also needs to be
rebuked for his use of valid observations to support a
faulty conclusion. Although I agree that the examples he
used stand as ample evidence of behavior which is unac
ceptable both in society as well as in any Stanford
residence, to use those incidents involving members of
housed fraternites as a reason for eliminating the system
as a whole is both misguided and unfair. I instead argue
that we should take Cole's advice by researching the lists
of fraternity incidents on file at Residential Education,
not (as he suggests) to convince ourselves that the system
should be flushed, but rather to convince ourselves what
we may already know: not every currently housed frater
nity deserves to reside in a University-owned residence.

Before addressing this point further, let me first estab
lish the fact that there are fraternities that are currently
flourishing on this campus without the inherent organiza
tional and social benefits which come from living under
the same roof. Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Kappa Psi both
enjoyed successful rushes last spring, and have every rea
son to expect similar successes this year. There is also the
case of Zeta Psi, whose membership has been dwindling
since having its house taken away by Res Ed in December
1981. Its attractiveness to potential members has eroded
significantly as it has been forced to answer the question,
"You don't have a house — what else can you offer?"
Other houses have experienced wild fluctuations in the
size of each spring's new pledge class, depending on the
degree of scrutiny put upon them by Res Ed.
"As our friends at Residential Education will attest, the
DU house is fairly similar in outlook and behavior to
other fraternities," according to Cole. I can only hope that
the administrators at Old Union and in the Row Office
have enough insight into the fraternity environment to be
able to laugh as I do at such a claim. Cole was no doubt
motivated to write his viewpoint by the justifiable embar
rassment and guilt he must have experienced while recall
ing his part in disrupting the harmony on the Row. As a
four-year member and former president of Stanford's Al
pha Omega chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity, I have
spent 11 quarters in residence across the street from a
group which I could only hope would one day share our
desire to live in a constructive, cooperative environment.
Cole's perspective on other housed fraternities — espe

daily my own — during his time in the DU house was
clearly flawed, and he even seems to have lost touch with
recent efforts to change attitudes within his own frater
nity.
Don't let this claim of relative purity overshadow the
reality that Sigma Chi is not without its own list of errors
in judgment. What sets us apart from some currently
housed fraternities, however, is that we — both as individ
uals and as a group — are not afraid to be held ac
countable for our actions. The accountability of individ
uals within their own residence (especially in the case of
Sigma Chi, where we own our own house) is essential for a
constructive collective living environment. History has
shown that the houses which flourish are those which
choose to independently curb the unacceptable behavior
of their members. Effective self-government has been the
cornerstone of our effort to perpetuate this existence. Res
Ed must now do its part to hold these independent collec
tivities accountable for their actions, as well as their ability
to answer the question,, "What does your group offer
Stanford?"
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano is in the perfect
position to ask just that. A thoughtful, relevant list of
criteria necessary for being a constructive addition to the
Stanford community should be drafted by Pisano and
those fraternities and sororities interested in remaining
active on campus. Such a list should contain requirements
for every aspect of fraternal living; it should include com
munity service, the incorporation of Residential Educa
tion programs, the holding of regular chapter meetings
and means for promoting faculty involvement. Incorpo
rating the Interfraternity Council (IFC) guidelines for re
sponsible party hosting would also ensure the presence of
a healthy and responsible social life for all of us to enjoy.
Using this criteria as a guideline, Res Ed and the Row Of
fice could easily measure the progress of both housed and
unhoused fraternities, and use this information when de
termining which groups deserve a residence.
It makes no sense, especially with more fraternities
desiring housing than there are houses available for them,
that a fraternity should be given the privilege of living in a
University-owned house if it behaves as Cole has des
cribed. It is painfully obvious, therefore, that Res Ed must
develop a system for deciding fairly which groups should
remain housed, and which need to substantiate their very
existence. By housing only those fraternal organizations
which have demonstrated their desire to contribute to
Residential Education, Stanford can rest assured that its
unique, diverse campus environment will remain un
spoiled.

uals and as a group — are not afraid to be held ac
countable for our actions. The accountability of individ
uals within their own residence (especially in the case of
Sigma Chi, where we own our own house) is essential for a
constructive collective living environment. History has
shown that the houses which flourish are those which
choose to independently curb the unacceptable behavior
of their members. Effective self-government has been the
cornerstone of our effort to perpetuate this existence. Res
Ed must now do its part to hold these independent collec
tivities accountable for their actions, as well as their ability
to answer the question,, "What does your group offer
Stanford?"
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano is in the perfect
position to ask just that. A thoughtful, relevant list of
criteria necessary for being a constructive addition to the
Stanford community should be drafted by Pisano and
those fraternities and sororities interested in remaining
active on campus. Such a list should contain requirements
for every aspect of fraternal living; it should include com
munity service, the incorporation of Residential Educa
tion programs, the holding of regular chapter meetings
and means for promoting faculty involvement. Incorpo
rating the Interfraternity Council (IFC) guidelines for re
sponsible party hosting would also ensure the presence of
a healthy and responsible social life for all of us to enjoy.
Using this criteria as a guideline, Res Ed and the Row Of
fice could easily measure the progress of both housed and
unhoused fraternities, and use this information when de
termining which groups deserve a residence.
It makes no sense, especially with more fraternities
desiring housing than there are houses available for them,
that a fraternity should be given the privilege of living in a
University-owned house if it behaves as Cole has des
cribed. It is painfully obvious, therefore, that Res Ed must
develop a system for deciding fairly which groups should
remain housed, and which need to substantiate their very
existence. By housing only those fraternal organizations
which have demonstrated their desire to contribute to
Residential Education, Stanford can rest assured that its
unique, diverse campus environment will remain un
spoiled.

Luke Cole must be praised for the amazing piece of in
trospection and self-evaluation put forth in his viewpoint
which concluded that "the fraternity system at Stanford
should be abolished" (Daily, April 4). He also needs to be
rebuked for his use of valid observations to support a
faulty conclusion. Although I agree that the examples he
used stand as ample evidence of behavior which is unac
ceptable both in society as well as in any Stanford
residence, to use those incidents involving members of
housed fraternites as a reason for eliminating the system
as a whole is both misguided and unfair. I instead argue
that we should take Cole's advice by researching the lists
of fraternity incidents on file at Residential Education,
not (as he suggests) to convince ourselves that the system
should be flushed, but rather to convince ourselves what
we may already know: not every currently housed frater
nity deserves to reside in a University-owned residence.

Before addressing this point further, let me first estab
lish the fact that there are fraternities that are currently
flourishing on this campus without the inherent organiza
tional and social benefits which come from living under
the same roof. Sigma Phi Epsilon and Phi Kappa Psi both
enjoyed successful rushes last spring, and have every rea
son to expect similar successes this year. There is also the
case of Zeta Psi, whose membership has been dwindling
since having its house taken away by Res Ed in December
1981. Its attractiveness to potential members has eroded
significantly as it has been forced to answer the question,
"You don't have a house — what else can you offer?"
Other houses have experienced wild fluctuations in the
size of each spring's new pledge class, depending on the
degree of scrutiny put upon them by Res Ed.
"As our friends at Residential Education will attest, the
DU house is fairly similar in outlook and behavior to
other fraternities," according to Cole. I can only hope that
the administrators at Old Union and in the Row Office
have enough insight into the fraternity environment to be
able to laugh as I do at such a claim. Cole was no doubt
motivated to write his viewpoint by the justifiable embar
rassment and guilt he must have experienced while recall
ing his part in disrupting the harmony on the Row. As a
four-year member and former president of Stanford's Al
pha Omega chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity, I have
spent 11 quarters in residence across the street from a
group which I could only hope would one day share our
desire to live in a constructive, cooperative environment.
Cole's perspective on other housed fraternities — espe

daily my own — during his time in the DU house was
clearly flawed, and he even seems to have lost touch with
recent efforts to change attitudes within his own frater
nity.
Don't let this claim of relative purity overshadow the
reality that Sigma Chi is not without its own list of errors
in judgment. What sets us apart from some currently
housed fraternities, however, is that we — both as individ
uals and as a group — are not afraid to be held ac
countable for our actions. The accountability of individ
uals within their own residence (especially in the case of
Sigma Chi, where we own our own house) is essential for a
constructive collective living environment. History has
