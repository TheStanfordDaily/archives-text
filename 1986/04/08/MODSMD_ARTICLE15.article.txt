# The 						rites of spring return
## 
### 
Not too long ago, I was strapped to my desk, chained to
my Macintosh, and shackled with books, pens and notes.
Occasionally I allowed myself the privilege of leaving the
desk, but only if I could provide myself with an adequate
justification — usually it was food or sleep. On those rare
occasions of academic liberation, I might run into some
acquaintance with whom I would engage in curt and for
mal conversation. "How are you? I'm fine. Well, I'm
afraid I have a lot to do. Right. See you later. . . Sound
familiar?

It was a ghastly quarter of dismal weather, mechanical
movement from class to class, neglected friendships and
unwanted pounds. And yet, as the cliche goes, "it all
seems so long ago," and the horrid memories of late night
papers and problem sets are already beginning to blur and
assume that nostalgic characteristic of a humorous
"remember when . . The manifestations of winter quar
ter's tyrannous reign, however, remain to torment me: I
still have the umbrella which was rendered unusable by
the beating rain and relentless wind; I still have the
binders which I mechanically opened, closed and opened
again; I am troubled by friendships and associations which
sorely need repair and nourishment; I won't even mention
the pounds.
Spring quarter. What better time to make these repara
tions and celebrate our release from the oppression and
severity of the winter? Indeed, spring is a time for frivolity
and bacchanal festivity. And yet. within all the frenetic ac
tivity of the season, there exists an inalienable set of rules
and rituals which quietly govern our seemingly chaotic
and passionate rejoicing. Instinctively, we participate in
the rites of spring.
One particular ritual, of course, is the seasonal fast.
Meals are instantly reduced to Diet Cokes (just ask Beth),
salads and carrot sticks. We all engage in this ceremony in
some way or another, although curiously enough, there
seems to exist another facet of the rite which prevents us
from divulging to others that each of us is indeed a partici
pant in the fast.
Then, of course, there is the related homage to the sun
god. We seem to believe that by denuding and humbly
prostrating ourselves before him, we will somehow ap
pease that omnipotent deity. We remain in the position
for hours, enduring the relentless heat and radiation; we
burn and discolor ourselves in hopes that in doing so, we
are pleasing the god.
You know, I really don't feel like writing this column. I
haven't for weeks. This column was due last Thursday,
and although I didn't have much to do last week, I could
not come up with the inspiration to write three double
spaced, type-written pages. It is now Sunday afternoon,
and I am sitting dejectedly in front of my Macintosh won
dering desperately if I want this text printed or not. I
probably will end up turning it in, since it is now 4:03 and

The Daily, which just called, needs it by 6 p.m. I've done
just about everything to keep myself from finishing this
column: I've read my mail from the past week; I've eaten
breakfast, brunch and a snack. I've even exercised.
At the moment, I'm not even ruminating over the
stupidity of what I'm writing. I'm much more concerned
about the choice of the restaurant I'm going to tonight. I
wonder when eating meat will come back in style.
I don't believe I am the only person afflicted with this
disease. I couldn't be the sole Stanford student who has
lost all capacity for self-motivation or academic pursuit.
Or am I? At least, I can take solace in the fact that last
Wednesday's columnist casually forgot to submit a
column. Although this mindless gibberish may be worse
than none at all, I am at least doing the paper a favor by
consuming some of the space on the opinions page.
I am afraid that my brain has atrophied from lack of
substantial use over Spring Break. At a party last night, I
found myself silent and awkward with words; in all
honesty, I believe the disease has progressed to the point
at which fundamental cerebral functioning and the
capacity for simple articulation have been significantly im
paired. (I had to have somebody read over this to make
sure I didn't make any grammatical errors.) I often
wonder if people who live in the suburbs are permanently
afflicted with this mental disorder. Is the A-Team all that
gratifying?
Back to the column. Since I am incapable of writing in
any coherent manner, I'll just describe the original intent
of this column. I had wanted to describe the silliness of the
Rush ceremony, as well as the existence of the entire
Greek system, whose real purpose in life seems to be
divulged exclusively to its members. As a non-member, I
certainly can't figure it out. What's even more puzzling is
that I haven't the least desire to know.
I then would have gone on to talk about the spring
mating ritual, a ceremony in which people discover other
people (as well as hormones) they never knew existed. 1
would have remarked about the spring emphasis on health
and fitness and the attitude of "I'm okay, you're okay, but
I look more okay than you."
But the principle intent of the column was to comment
on the decrease of academic intensity and mental applica
tion. and the increase of frivolous and superficial activity
— the rejection of the contemplative and the embrace
ment of the sensual.
This column, though I have not read it, appears to have
wandered without much purpose over a number of issues.
At points, it has promised to reach inspiring insights (as is
Kathy's habit). Unfortunately, Kathy has to go to dinner
in a few minutes and so, while she is getting ready, it is up
to me to put the finishing touches on this column which is
both three days late and 45 minutes early.
I find that it is as easy to finish someone else's column
which I have not read as it is to finish one of my own poli
tical science or economics papers. Let's try the philosophi
cal English literature approach:
The spirit of spring informs us all in ways we do not ex
pect. While it touches our minds, it also touches our
spirits. While it informs us with frivolity, its rites are a
purposeful glimpse at our inner selves. And while it might
be a fresh burst of life, it might also be the packaging on a
can of Starkist tuna too.
You should see my papers.
