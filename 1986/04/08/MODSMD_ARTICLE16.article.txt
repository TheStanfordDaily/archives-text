U.S. policy over
Central American
conflicts incorrect
U.S. policy in Central America is
tragically misguided. Our wealth and
power are now being used to destroy
innocent lives, a state of affairs
hauntingly similar to our war in Viet
nam. Our agents, like Secretary of
State George Shultz, are up to their
elbows in blood.
It is strangely ironic that the Anti
genocide Treaty was finally ratified
by the U.S. Senate last month, after a
wait of many years. We continue,
however, through our proxies, to
commit genocide in Central America.
We should study the peace
proposals, designed to stop the killing
in Central America, which were
issued in mid-January of this year by
the Contadora nations and their sup
porters: Brazil, Argentina, Peru and
Uraguay (Caraballeda Message
toward Central America Peace, Secur
ity and Democracy). The points listed
below provide a basis for asking our
government to cut off any further aid
of any kind to the brutal contras and
somocistas attacking Nicaragua. Un
der the terms of the Caraballeda
Message. it might be possible, in addi
tion, to stop or curb the genocidal
bombings now occurring, with our as
sistance. every day in El Salvador.
1. Political solution centered
around a Latin American effort.

2. Self determination recognized
and respected.
3. Non-intervention by other na
tions in internal affairs of other na
tions.
4. Territorial integrity maintained.
5. Pluralistic democracies pursued
by all nations.
6. Non-presence of weapons or
military bases of foreign military
powers.
7. No undertaking of military ac
tions with foreign military powers.
8. Non-presence of foreign military
advisers or troops.
9. No political, legislative or mili
tary support for groups intending to
subvert or destabilize constitutional
order.
10. Observance of human rights.
In our support of savage dictator
ships in many parts of the world, the
hypocrisy of U.S. foreign policy is
clearly revealed. We cannot speak
sanctimoniously of spreading
democracy and, in the same breath,
praise our friends — Botha, Duarte.
Pinochet and others. Owing to
popular pressure. Congress is res
ponding to the demands of many
Americans for a U.S. foreign policy
dedicated to the ideal of promoting
peace and justice in the world, bring
ing an end to exploiting the poor and
crucifying their leaders, and creating
a more equitable distribution of
wealth so that children everywhere
can get enough to eat and their par
ents can lead less desperate lives.

'Star Wars' effort
linked to the new
free electron laser
The recent article (Daily, April 4)
on the free electron laser (FEL), like
the Campus Report article on the
same topic, neglects the military
aspects of the program. It is no coin
cidence that 75 percent of FEL's
funding comes from the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) program:
the FEL is being funded for use as a
"Star Wars" weapon.
According to recent Pentagon
statements, the free electron laser is
currently the best hope for a directed
energy weapon. Not intended to
protect the American population, this
"Star Wars" system would be useful
in destroying Soviet satellites or in
lessening Soviet missile retaliation
after a U.S. first strike. SDI is an ad
junct to other first-strike U.S.
weaponry like the MX. Pershing and
D-5 (Trident II) missiles. In the name
of basic research, certain scientists
are helping to develop offensive SDI
weapons at Stanford.
Of course, there is basic physics to
be learned and there are benign in
dustrial and medical applications of
the free electron laser — these are the
main motives of the researchers in
volved. But it is politically naive for
these scientists to expect to remain
neutral in the debate over SDI. The
SDI office is using scientist participa

tion in the program as evidence of
support for the Star Wars system it
self. And indeed, what stronger form
of support for SDI is possible than
actively working to create its compo
nents?
A recent poll of American Physical
Society members showed a large
majority of physicists doubting the
feasibility of "Star Wars" and agree
ing that it is a step in the wrong direc
tion for disarmament. Many faculty
and graduate students are signing a
pledge not to accept SDI funds.
People are starting to realize that SDI
is not a defensive system, but an of
fensive trillion-dollar dream for
defense contractors — one that is
stalling arms negotiations, undermin
ing existing treaties, and stimulating a
new arms race on earth and in space.
John Madey, one of the principal
investigators for the free electron
laser project, was quoted as hoping to
attract more undergraduates to it. I
hope, on the contrary, that under
graduates and others will shun it and
join us on April 21 in White Plaza in
a protest of SDI and Stanford's in
volvement in it.

'Star Wars' effort
linked to the new
free electron laser
The recent article (Daily, April 4)
on the free electron laser (FEL), like
the Campus Report article on the
same topic, neglects the military
aspects of the program. It is no coin
cidence that 75 percent of FEL's
funding comes from the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) program:
the FEL is being funded for use as a
"Star Wars" weapon.
According to recent Pentagon
statements, the free electron laser is
currently the best hope for a directed
energy weapon. Not intended to
protect the American population, this
"Star Wars" system would be useful
in destroying Soviet satellites or in
lessening Soviet missile retaliation
after a U.S. first strike. SDI is an ad
junct to other first-strike U.S.
weaponry like the MX. Pershing and
D-5 (Trident II) missiles. In the name
of basic research, certain scientists
are helping to develop offensive SDI
weapons at Stanford.
Of course, there is basic physics to
be learned and there are benign in
dustrial and medical applications of
the free electron laser — these are the
main motives of the researchers in
volved. But it is politically naive for
these scientists to expect to remain
neutral in the debate over SDI. The
SDI office is using scientist participa

tion in the program as evidence of
support for the Star Wars system it
self. And indeed, what stronger form
of support for SDI is possible than
actively working to create its compo
nents?
A recent poll of American Physical
Society members showed a large
majority of physicists doubting the
feasibility of "Star Wars" and agree
ing that it is a step in the wrong direc
tion for disarmament. Many faculty
and graduate students are signing a
pledge not to accept SDI funds.
People are starting to realize that SDI
is not a defensive system, but an of
fensive trillion-dollar dream for
defense contractors — one that is
stalling arms negotiations, undermin
ing existing treaties, and stimulating a
new arms race on earth and in space.
John Madey, one of the principal
investigators for the free electron
laser project, was quoted as hoping to
attract more undergraduates to it. I
hope, on the contrary, that under
graduates and others will shun it and
join us on April 21 in White Plaza in
a protest of SDI and Stanford's in
volvement in it.

U.S. policy over
Central American
conflicts incorrect
U.S. policy in Central America is
tragically misguided. Our wealth and
power are now being used to destroy
innocent lives, a state of affairs
hauntingly similar to our war in Viet
nam. Our agents, like Secretary of
State George Shultz, are up to their
elbows in blood.
It is strangely ironic that the Anti
genocide Treaty was finally ratified
by the U.S. Senate last month, after a
wait of many years. We continue,
however, through our proxies, to
commit genocide in Central America.
We should study the peace
proposals, designed to stop the killing
in Central America, which were
issued in mid-January of this year by
the Contadora nations and their sup
porters: Brazil, Argentina, Peru and
Uraguay (Caraballeda Message
toward Central America Peace, Secur
ity and Democracy). The points listed
below provide a basis for asking our
government to cut off any further aid
of any kind to the brutal contras and
somocistas attacking Nicaragua. Un
der the terms of the Caraballeda
Message. it might be possible, in addi
tion, to stop or curb the genocidal
bombings now occurring, with our as
sistance. every day in El Salvador.
