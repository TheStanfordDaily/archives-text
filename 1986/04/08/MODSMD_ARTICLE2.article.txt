# House declares itself sanctuary

### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Saying they have "a moral respon
sibility to aid those fleeing violence in
their own lands," students living in
Columbae House yesterday declared
their residence a sanctuary for
Central American refugees and an
nounced plans to shelter a Salvadoran
or Guatemalan national in the near
future.
At a press conference featuring a
Salvadoran refugee and representa
tives of various student activist
groups, Columbae resident Galen
Hilgard read a statement that said in
part: "The U.S. government has
failed to provide the protections
guaranteed to these refugees under
international law and domestic law,
and thus the responsibility falls upon
individuals and small communities to
take action and respond to the crisis."
Senior Caroline Paul, a Columbae
resident who moderated the press
conference, said the statement
represented "the deep soul-searching
of everyone here" and took into ac
count the views of all 55 students
living in the house.
In a related development, a repre

sentative of Stanford Hillel told
reporters and others gathered on the
Columbae House lawn that his or
ganization plans to declare itself a
sanctuary later this week.
The representative, Joel Nelson,
said "the analogies between Central
America and central Europe are ob
vious" and urged U.S. citizens to
shelter Latin American refugees just
as some Europeans sheltered Jews
during World War 11.
In an interview after the press con
ference, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said he was dubious
about non-students living in Univer
sity housing. He said non-students
"don't have the same basis of sharing,
sharing of responsibility and pur
pose."
Asked what the University would
do should Columbae shelter a
refugee, Lyons said, "I really don't
know." He added that under Univer
sity housing policy, declaring a
University-owned residence a sanctu
ary could result in a loss of housing
privileges.
Paul told The Daily yesterday that

A Salvadoran refugee and senior Mario Huerta spoke at Columbae yesterday when the house declared itself a
sanctuary for Latin American refugees. House residents, who sat on the steps in front of the campus
cooperative, said they may soon house a refugee.
low Columbae to house a refugee, each resident would
have the refugee as a "guest" for the allowed three days
and thus avoid breaking their housing contracts.
Lyons said he was unaware that this option was under
consideration by Columbae residents, but added that a
refugee would be considered a guest of the house, not of
individual residents.
But Lyons added that Columbae was dealing with "a
very important issue" by offering sanctuary.
Regarding U.S. immigration policies, Lyons said, "I
agree with some people who say that the U.S. is
selectively enforcing its own laws. If consistency is the
goal, then the U.S. certainly isn't going to win any prizes."
In an expression of solidarity following the reading of
the Columbae statement, Stanford's new Lutheran
campus minister, Rev. Herb Schmidt, declared his support
of Columbae's sanctuary offer.
"When the government disobeys the law, it is the
public's obligation to uphold it," Schmidt said.
Representatives of the student activist group Sanctuary
at Stanford praised Columbae's action as a "correct, ap
propriate and necessary response to the illegal acts of the
U.S. government."
Following the statements of solidarity, a Salvadoran
refugee told the crowd of about 70 that he had decided to
flee his country after government forces assassinated his
brother, a university professor.
Dressed in a red bandana and dark glasses, the refugee,
who gave his name only as Herman, said he feared harm
to his family should his actual identity become known to
Salvadoran authorities.
Through an interpreter, Herman said the assassination
of his brother prompted him to begin working "with com
munities for the sake of the people."
"One night, death squads came and took away two of

my comrades. ... An old lady stood up to them and she
also had to be assassinated because she was the only wit
ness," he said. "That very night I made the decision to
abandon my house, my family, my people."
He said he fled to the United States rather than a neigh
boring country because "since the U.S. is larger, it is
harder for them to get you."
He finished his speech with a tearful plea to the audi
ence to stop U.S. intervention in El Salvador. "You are
responsible for what is happening in my country, and only
you can help us," he said.
In the Daily interview, Paul spoke of the difficulty
Columbae residents had in coming to a consensus on the
sanctuary issue.
"It took literally months and months," she said.
"People have a knee-jerk submission to authority. We
had to learn to question authority and get to the gut level
of our priorities."
Paul also questioned the principles behind the housing
policy at Stanford, calling sanctuary a moral issue that
transcends the technicalities of specific policies.
While the housing of a refugee in University housing
would be an unprecedented act, Columbae is not the first
organization to declare itself a sanctuary zone. More than
20 universities nationwide, including nine University of
California campuses, have declared all or part of their
campuses sanctuary for Central American refugees. Other
areas, such as the city of San Francisco and the state of
New Mexico, have also declared themselves sanctuary
zones.
Such groups typically assert that U.S. immigration
policy is skewed for political reasons. The official declara
tion of Columbae House, for instance, stated that "the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has denied these
refugees the legal protections guaranteed them. While
over 75 percent of all refugees from the Soviet Union and
Iran are granted political asylum if they apply for it, only 2
percent of Salvadorans and less than 1 percent of
Guatemalans are granted this status.
