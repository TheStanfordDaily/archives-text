# Bug explores Meyer, Green and little brown boxes
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
The sun beat down like a hammer
on her throbbing head as she stag
gered over the crest of yet another
huge sand dune. She couldn't remem
ber how long she had been tost here in
the desert, but it had been far too long.
She was delirious with the heat and
her parched mouth felt like a pack of
cotton swabs or some other very dry
thing. Finally just as her life was flash
ing before her in a fast-forward blur of
long-forgotten images, she spotted a
small pool of water. She rushed
toward it, only to collapse in exhaus
tion a few feet short of the life-giving
liquid. Now she lay there, barely con
scious, her vision glazed over, unable
to reach the water.
Suddenly she was jolted awake and
her vision cleared. She realized that it
was all a dream. She had fallen asleep
in Meyer again, but now she was safe
and sound here with her Western Cul
ture reading. As the spring quarter sun
beat through the window onto the
open book in front of her, she sighed,
got a drink from the drinking fountain
next to her, and thanked her lucky
stars that she hadn't been born a
camel.
Additions and Corrections Depart

Last week's column included a
question asking how much money is

collected annually from parking tick
ets issued on the Stanford campus. I
could get no firm answer from the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Depart
ment, to which most parking fines go
(some also go to the city of Palo
Alto).

However, I subsequently received
some very helpful information from
Heidi Beck of the University News
and Publications Service. She sent me
a press release from September 1984
which estimated the number of
parking tickets issued annually on
campus at about 40,000. The fines
generally range from $7 to $12 each,
according to the release, so that
works out to about $400,000 col
lected annually.
Ironically, while Stanford receives
none of that money, it must expend
more than $500,000 each year for
parking enforcement (i.e., salary for

seven full-time ticketers, mainte
nance of signs, etc.), according to the
release.
That $500,000 expense, coupled
with the approximately $330,000
spent annually to fund the Marguerite
bus system, effectively wipes out the
estimated $830,000 collected an
nually from sale of parking stickers,
and other income generated by pay
parking lots and daily permits.
So, any way one looks at it, the
University really doesn't make any
money from on-campus parking.
Heidi Beck's help was completely
unsolicited, and I appreciate her
thoughtfulness very much. I try to be
thorough, but I'm sure that my
answers are often incomplete or un
satisfying. I'm always grateful for
help, and all Bug Me readers should
feel free to send me information or
correct me if I'm missing something.
Speaking of missing something,
there was an egregious error in last
week's column. I stated that Dr.
Demento had been demented (that is,
the show had been on the air) for 50
years; the actual figure is 15. I'm sure
that makes my second statement, that
the man who plays Dr. Demento is
middle-aged, a little more plausible.
Dear Bug Me,
I'm sitting in one of the olive green
vinyl chairs in Meyer Library, with the
sun beating through a window on me.
Can I get a tan from this?
- Mandy

-1 wish the answer to this question
was affirmative, because that would
solve one of the huge dilemmas that
faces Stanford students every spring
quarter: namely, how to study effec
tively while still enjoying the skin
darkening benefits of Mr. Sun.
(Because we all know that nobody
ever really gets anything done while
studying outside.)
Unfortunately, as it turns out, the
chances of getting a tan while sitting
behind a window, no matter how
much sunlight is landing on you, are
slim if not negligible.
I talked first to a staffer at the
Caribbean Sun Tan Salon (one of my
favorite hangouts) in Los Altos. She
was quite sure that a person can't get
tan in this situation, but didn't have
too clear an explanation why.
So I then talked to Dr. Ira Greene
of the Medical Center's Dermatology
Clinic. He explained that one of the
properties of window glass is that it
deflects or stops almost all of the
ultraviolet rays in the light spectrum
(i.e., those rays that cause skin to
burn or tan) while letting through
those rays that create visible light.
Greene said that there are two
types of skin-affecting ultraviolet
rays: UVB rays, which cause burning,
and UVA rays, which cause tanning.
Windows block all UVB rays and all
but a small portion of UVA rays, so a
person sitting behind a window may
experience some slight tanning, but

nothing significant if he or she has
normal skin.
Dear Bug Me,
Why don 7 Green and Meyer libra
ries have the "book detection" system
used at other libraries? It seems that
they'd save money in the long run, in
stalling book alarms and eliminating
the crabby human backpack ex
aminers.
- Anonymous
Last time I checked (i.e., the last
time I accidently had a library book in
my backpack while leaving Meyer
and was doubled over by a thun
derous shot to the midsection from
the detector-triggered locked
turnstile), Meyer did have a book de
tection system.
Green doesn't have one, however,
and according to Director of Univer
sity Libraries David Weber, the rea
son is primarily economic. Weber es
timated the cost of installing such a
system in Green at about $10,000.
Plans are set for installing a book de
tection sytem at Green soon, but
those plans are contingent on the
availability of funds.
At one point, according to Weber,
library officials were waiting to install
the system at Green until it could be
installed simultaneously with an
automated circulation system (which
would eliminate the need to fill out
borrowing cards for every book
checked out). However, due to lack
of funds, the installation of the auto

matic circulation system has been put
on a back burner, and now library of
ficials plan to go ahead with the book
detection system independent of the
other system.
Dear Bug Me,
Why hasn't The Daily box outside
Branner been fixed? The rain-shelter
portion has been broken for over a
month.
- Anonymous
It seems that this particular "little
brown box" is highly abused.
According to Jane Abraham, The
Daily's circulation manager, one of
the paper's delivery persons is in
charge of repairing the boxes. He
repaired the box outside Branner
once already this year, only to find it
destroyed again the very next day.
The box will be repaired again, but
if it is damaged another time, it will
be removed and put in a safer loca
tion, Abraham said, and Branner
probably will "not receive The
Daily." Maybe Branner residents had
better post a 24-hour guard on their
box.
In the meantime, Abraham has a
complaint of her own. She says that
every weekend brings a new collec
tion of beer cans and other debris to
The Daily boxes, and this is "very ir
ritating" to the delivery people as
well as to Daily readers who get stuck
with a paper that smells of beer.
"Next time, use the garbage can,
not The Daily box," says Abraham.

Last week's column included a
question asking how much money is

collected annually from parking tick
ets issued on the Stanford campus. I
could get no firm answer from the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs Depart
ment, to which most parking fines go
(some also go to the city of Palo
Alto).

However, I subsequently received
some very helpful information from
Heidi Beck of the University News
and Publications Service. She sent me
a press release from September 1984
which estimated the number of
parking tickets issued annually on
campus at about 40,000. The fines
generally range from $7 to $12 each,
according to the release, so that
works out to about $400,000 col
lected annually.
Ironically, while Stanford receives
none of that money, it must expend
more than $500,000 each year for
parking enforcement (i.e., salary for

seven full-time ticketers, mainte
nance of signs, etc.), according to the
release.
That $500,000 expense, coupled
with the approximately $330,000
spent annually to fund the Marguerite
bus system, effectively wipes out the
estimated $830,000 collected an
nually from sale of parking stickers,
and other income generated by pay
parking lots and daily permits.
So, any way one looks at it, the
University really doesn't make any
money from on-campus parking.
Heidi Beck's help was completely
unsolicited, and I appreciate her
thoughtfulness very much. I try to be
thorough, but I'm sure that my
answers are often incomplete or un
satisfying. I'm always grateful for
help, and all Bug Me readers should
feel free to send me information or
correct me if I'm missing something.
Speaking of missing something,
there was an egregious error in last
week's column. I stated that Dr.
Demento had been demented (that is,
the show had been on the air) for 50
years; the actual figure is 15. I'm sure
that makes my second statement, that
the man who plays Dr. Demento is
middle-aged, a little more plausible.
Dear Bug Me,
I'm sitting in one of the olive green
vinyl chairs in Meyer Library, with the
sun beating through a window on me.
Can I get a tan from this?
- Mandy

-1 wish the answer to this question
was affirmative, because that would
solve one of the huge dilemmas that
faces Stanford students every spring
quarter: namely, how to study effec
tively while still enjoying the skin
darkening benefits of Mr. Sun.
(Because we all know that nobody
ever really gets anything done while
studying outside.)
Unfortunately, as it turns out, the
chances of getting a tan while sitting
behind a window, no matter how
much sunlight is landing on you, are
slim if not negligible.
I talked first to a staffer at the
Caribbean Sun Tan Salon (one of my
favorite hangouts) in Los Altos. She
was quite sure that a person can't get
tan in this situation, but didn't have
too clear an explanation why.
So I then talked to Dr. Ira Greene
of the Medical Center's Dermatology
Clinic. He explained that one of the
properties of window glass is that it
deflects or stops almost all of the
ultraviolet rays in the light spectrum
(i.e., those rays that cause skin to
burn or tan) while letting through
those rays that create visible light.
Greene said that there are two
types of skin-affecting ultraviolet
rays: UVB rays, which cause burning,
and UVA rays, which cause tanning.
Windows block all UVB rays and all
but a small portion of UVA rays, so a
person sitting behind a window may
experience some slight tanning, but

nothing significant if he or she has
normal skin.
Dear Bug Me,
Why don 7 Green and Meyer libra

they'd save money in the long run, in
stalling book alarms and eliminating
the crabby human backpack ex

Last time I checked (i.e., the last
time I accidently had a library book in
my backpack while leaving Meyer
and was doubled over by a thun
derous shot to the midsection from
the detector-triggered locked
turnstile), Meyer did have a book de
tection system.
Green doesn't have one, however,
and according to Director of Univer
sity Libraries David Weber, the rea
son is primarily economic. Weber es
timated the cost of installing such a
system in Green at about $10,000.
Plans are set for installing a book de
tection sytem at Green soon, but
those plans are contingent on the
availability of funds.
At one point, according to Weber,
library officials were waiting to install
the system at Green until it could be
installed simultaneously with an
automated circulation system (which
would eliminate the need to fill out
borrowing cards for every book
checked out). However, due to lack
of funds, the installation of the auto

matic circulation system has been put
on a back burner, and now library of
ficials plan to go ahead with the book
detection system independent of the

Dear Bug Me,
Why hasn't The Daily box outside
Branner been fixed? The rain-shelter
portion has been broken for over a
month.
- Anonymous
It seems that this particular "little
brown box" is highly abused.
According to Jane Abraham, The
Daily's circulation manager, one of
the paper's delivery persons is in
charge of repairing the boxes. He
repaired the box outside Branner
once already this year, only to find it
destroyed again the very next day.
The box will be repaired again, but
if it is damaged another time, it will
be removed and put in a safer loca
tion, Abraham said, and Branner
probably will "not receive The
Daily." Maybe Branner residents had
better post a 24-hour guard on their
box.
In the meantime, Abraham has a
complaint of her own. She says that
every weekend brings a new collec
tion of beer cans and other debris to
The Daily boxes, and this is "very ir
ritating" to the delivery people as
well as to Daily readers who get stuck
with a paper that smells of beer.
"Next time, use the garbage can,
not The Daily box," says Abraham.
