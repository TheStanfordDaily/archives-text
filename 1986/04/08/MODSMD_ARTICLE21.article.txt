## Taxing our patience as well as our earnings 
### STEVEN LURIE Staff writer 
April 15 — something about that day
rings familiar to us all.
Most of us at Stanford think about the
April 15 back in high school when we ran
to the mailbox to see if we got the thick
package or the thin letter from the college
of our choice. However, for most people,
April 15 holds a different connotation:
Tax Day.
Every year local news programs inter
view late tax filers as they hurry to the post
office before the midnight deadline. Ac
cording to the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS), more than one-third of all individ
ual tax returns are filed after April 12.
What compels so many citizens to madly
rush to complete forms on time? A 1913
Constitutional amendment requires all
income-earning residents to file income
tax returns.
There are basically three categories of
students who file returns: those who are
employees of a company that has witheld
their earnings, those who own their own
business and those who are lucky enough
to have trusts set up for them. In addition,
there are students who should file, but
don't, and some seniors who don't yet file,
but will soon.
Most students have images of compli
cated forms, ambiguous instructions and a
watchful, unsympathetic IRS when they
think of the tax-filing process. However,
undergraduates who have already encoun
tered tax forms such as the W-2 and the
1040EZ (short form) while working
during school or in the summer realize that
tax-filing does not have to be an ordeal.
Employers automatically withhold tax
from one's paycheck. However, because
Americans are only taxed for income over
$3,300, everyone is entitled to a refund on
amounts withheld below the minimum.
Sally Schwin, at Hand R Block tax firm
in Palo Alto, advises those who know they
will not make over $3,300 in a given year
to claim "exempt" on the W-2 form that is
filled out before one starts working. By
doing so, no tax is withheld and no further
forms must be filed.
If one is not "exempt" and earns over
the minimum amount, one should file for a
refund because the tax is often dispropor
tional. That is, a summer income of $1,000
per month is taxed at the annual rate for
$12,000 even if one only works for three
months.
Also, Kelsy Irvin at Alpro Tax Services
notes that by filing, one's name is "put on
record which helps later for income
averaging after graduation." Finally, the
1040EZ form is short, easy and can be

filled out by following the IRS manual or
calling the toll free hot-line number (800
424-1040).
Students who own businesses that earn
more than $400 must file an additional
form called a Schedule C. To reduce pay
ments, tax accountant Bill Naiditsh advises
clients to "itemize and deduct!" By saving
receipts, one can reduce one's taxable
income by deducting the costs of auto and
other business expenses.
Such advice was echoed by two Stanford
students who operate their own businesses.
Senior Chris Loughridge obtains part of

his earning from a painting service. Lough
ridge has used certain tax loopholes that
apply to his painting business, such as for
depreciation and supply costs, to decrease
the tax on his overall income.
Also, Loughridge deducts part of his
board costs because he claims his college
room as a working office. When Lough
ridge bought a brand new car, he deducted
the sales tax as a business expense. Lough
ridge, who fills out the forms on his own,
maintains that any reasonable student can
do the same by "just following the instruc
tions."

For half the summer, senior David
Hamburg operates a fishing business in
Alaska. By filing on time and by carefully
following the rules, Hamburg only paid 4
percent in taxes last year — a remarkable
feat since his considerable earnings placed
him in the highest (50 percent) marginal
tax bracket.
Deductions such as depreciation on his
fishing boats has helped Hamburg save on
taxes from income earned during the rest
of his summers. Hamburg fills out his own
forms but has a certified public accountant
(CPA) check and sign them. Hamburg
stresses the importance of keeping records
and receipts not only for itemization
purposes, but also in case the IRS conducts
an audit.
To help students who cannot or do not
want to fill out the long 1040 form, tax
preparers such as Hand R Block charge
about $60 which is a third cheaper than the
$100 consultation for CPA's.
Connie Skidmore at Cooper and
Lybrand advises students with income
from trusts to let their parents include the
trust tax on their own forms. The K-2 trust
form is complicated and could require pro
fessional help. For this reason, most Stan
ford students have their parents take care
of their taxes. Senior Rick Amado said, "I
just let my dad handle my trust affairs."
A special tax case arises once one enters
the work force for the first time. Usually
one's income increases sharply with one's
first job. Taxes may be reduced by income
averaging — that is when the last 3 years
are taken into account and a lower rate is
applied. Requirements are strict (i.e. a stu
dent must have been financially indepen
dent in the past). One should check with a
tax preparer on these points before start
ing a first job.
Schwin at Hand R Block advises stu
dents who are about to enter the work
force to deduct the monthly payments on
large purchases such as a car or a condo.
Schwin notes, however, that, "The best
thing to do is to start an IRA (Individual
Retirement Account)."
Each year one can contribute up to
$2,000 and the tax on the earned interest
from the account is deferred until retire
ment when one is usually in a lower tax
bracket. One does not have to contribute
each year but by adding to the account one
reduces one's taxable income.
Certain cardinal tax rules apply for
people facing tax day. First, all forms must
be filed on time, since penalties are levied
on tardy returns. Also, one should care
fully follow directions and advice — and
keep good records on itemized deductions.
By doing so, students will not have to join
the mass that dashes to mail tax returns by
midnight on April 15.
