# Pay now, study later

Imagine that you've committed a slight indiscre
tion. Neither of you intended to have a child, espe
cially since both of you will be graduating next
quarter. But four months from now a little Johnny
or Susie is going to be around and neither of you is
interested in marriage just yet — careers come first.
So, you've decided to put the child up for adop
tion after its birth. Still, four years of Stanford edu
cation has instilled in both of you some sense ot
moral responsibility. You'd like to make sure that
your child gets a good college education. How can
you do that?
Most people would immediately think of estab
lishing a trust fund — putting money in a bank ac
count in the child's name which he could withdraw
in 2004 (the approximate year he would start col
lege). However, that might require a sizable invest
ment. Assuming the rate of interest your money
receives equals that of the annual increase in tui
tion, you would have to place $41,904 in the bank
to guarantee that four years at Stanford could be af
forded.
However, there may be another solution. Several
colleges and universities (e.g. University of Penn
sylvania, Canisius in New York and Allegheny in
Pennsylvania) now offer people the opportunity to
pay for their child's education up front. Duquesne
University, a private school in Pittsburgh with 6,500
students created a prepayment arrangement a year
ago. For a child who will enter in 2004, a payment
of $5,802 will take care of four years of future tui
tion.
Of course, Duquesne's annual tuition is now only
$5,850 (about half that at Stanford). But still, were
Stanford to adopt this same deal only about
$10,470 would be required — quite a bit less than
the $41,904 needed to go into a trust fund.
It is easy to see what a good deal Duquesne is of
fering. Assuming that Duquesne's tuition increases
at about 7 percent annually, a four year education
starting in 2004 would cost $93,942.
Of course there is a catch. Admission is not
assured. And if your child, despite inheriting your
great genes, cannot get in or decides not to go, you
would only get back your original investment —
without any accrued interest.
Tim Warner, an associate provost here,
remarked, "We've never formally considered a
prepayment system like that before. We haven't felt
the need to get into that type of arrangement. Other
schools might offer this to gain an advantage when
competing for students. Less selective institutions
feel more pressure to fill classes. At Stanford, a
prepayment arrangement might only complicate the
admissions process."
