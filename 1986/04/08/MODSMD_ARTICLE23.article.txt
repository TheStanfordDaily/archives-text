## UCLA knots Six-Pac race Stanford drops 1st league series in 2 years with 9-8 defeat 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
John Joslyn had three hits — in
cluding a two-run home run in
UCLA's five-run sixth inning — and
Alex Sanchez pitched two scoreless
innings in relief as the Bruins dumped
Stanford 9-8 in Los Angeles yester
day.
The game, which was originally
scheduled for Sunday hut was
postponed due to rain, was the
wrapup contest of a three-game series
between the two teams. The Bruins
captured Friday's opener, 6-5, and
Stanford came back to even the series
with a 7-2 win Saturday.
By dropping two of the three
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion games with UCLA, the Cardinal
suffered its first loss in a league series
in two years. In early April 1984,
Arizona State swept three games
from Stanford at Sunken Diamond.
Since then, Stanford had survived 18
Six-Pac series without a setback.
And with its win, UCLA climbed
into a first-place tie with Stanford
atop the standings of the Six-Pac. It's
likely too early to start talking pen
nant races, though. The teams, which
share identical 8-5 league marks,
have yet to play more than half of
their 30-game league schedules.
Stanford, trailing 2-1 after four in
nings, squandered early chances yes
terday to get to UCLA's starter, -Jeff
Conine. Besides hitting into two
double plays, the Cardinal stranded
six runners on base through the first
four frames.
"Early in the game we had a lot of
opportunities to score with runners in
scoring position," Coach Mark
Marquess said, "and we just couldn't
get a big hit. That's when we really
had a chance to cash in and we
weren't able to do it."
Toi Cook, Stanford's right fielder,
delivered a clutch two-out hit in the
top of the fifth. Cook lined a single to
left to score Ruben Amaro from third
and Mark Davis from second to stake
the Cardinal to a 3-2 lead.
The Cardinal didn't stay on top
long, however. UCLA came up with

two runs in the bottom of the inning
to drive Plemel — who, according to
Marquess, "didn't have good control
of his breaking ball. . . and was get
ting behind hitters" — from the
mound.
Stanford rallied for two more runs
in the top of the sixth to retake the
lead 5-4 on Davis' two-run single to
center, but the Cardinal again failed
to hold a lead.
In the bottom of the sixth, UCLA
rocked A 1 Osuna, Plemel's reliever,
for five runs. Osuna, whose record
fell to 5-2 with the loss, hit a batter,
surrendered two doubles and a single,
and then gave up Joslyn's 10th home

run of the year, a two-run shot to
right-center.
In this game of comebacks, it was
no surprise that Stanford threatened
again. Amaro drilled a three-run
blast in the eighth, his second round
tripper this year, to pull the Cardinal
to within a run.
After watching two pitchers,
Conine and David Dale, lose leads,
UCLA skipper Gary Adams went to
his ace in the hole, Sanchez.
The sophomore right-hander, who
started and won in Friday's game,
came in to end the eighth, and, after
allowing a single and a stolen base in
Stanford's ninth, got Frank Carey to

pop to short and struck out Harris to
end the game.
In notching his first save of the
year, Sanchez preserved the win for
Dale, 1-0.
Card notes
Davis' run in Stanford's fifth inning
yesterday marked the 219 th time he
has crossed the plate in his career for
the Six-Pac team. Former teammate
Pete Stanicek, who graduated last
year, set the league milestone last
year at 220 . . . Davis also extended
his hitting streak to seven games with
a single in the sixth.

nant races, though. The teams, which
share identical 8-5 league marks,
have yet to play more than half of
their 30-game league schedules.
Stanford, trailing 2-1 after four in
nings, squandered early chances yes
terday to get to UCLA's starter, -Jeff
Conine. Besides hitting into two
double plays, the Cardinal stranded
six runners on base through the first
four frames.
"Early in the game we had a lot of
opportunities to score with runners in
scoring position," Coach Mark
Marquess said, "and we just couldn't
get a big hit. That's when we really
had a chance to cash in and we
weren't able to do it."
Toi Cook, Stanford's right fielder,
delivered a clutch two-out hit in the
top of the fifth. Cook lined a single to
left to score Ruben Amaro from third
and Mark Davis from second to stake
the Cardinal to a 3-2 lead.
The Cardinal didn't stay on top
long, however. UCLA came up with

two runs in the bottom of the inning
to drive Plemel — who, according to
Marquess, "didn't have good control
of his breaking ball. . . and was get
ting behind hitters" — from the
mound.
Stanford rallied for two more runs
in the top of the sixth to retake the
lead 5-4 on Davis' two-run single to
center, but the Cardinal again failed
to hold a lead.
In the bottom of the sixth, UCLA
rocked A 1 Osuna, Plemel's reliever,
for five runs. Osuna, whose record
fell to 5-2 with the loss, hit a batter,
surrendered two doubles and a single,
and then gave up Joslyn's 10th home

run of the year, a two-run shot to
right-center.
In this game of comebacks, it was
no surprise that Stanford threatened
again. Amaro drilled a three-run
blast in the eighth, his second round
tripper this year, to pull the Cardinal
to within a run.
After watching two pitchers,
Conine and David Dale, lose leads,
UCLA skipper Gary Adams went to
his ace in the hole, Sanchez.
The sophomore right-hander, who
started and won in Friday's game,
came in to end the eighth, and, after
allowing a single and a stolen base in
Stanford's ninth, got Frank Carey to

pop to short and struck out Harris to
end the game.
In notching his first save of the
year, Sanchez preserved the win for
Dale, 1-0.
Card notes
Davis' run in Stanford's fifth inning
yesterday marked the 219 th time he
has crossed the plate in his career for
the Six-Pac team. Former teammate
Pete Stanicek, who graduated last
year, set the league milestone last
year at 220 . . . Davis also extended
his hitting streak to seven games with
a single in the sixth.

Things have been pretty boring this year in the Stanford bullpen, as the Cardinal starters have usually given
strong performances. But yesterday at Jackie Robinson Stadium in Los Angeles, both the starters and the
relievers had problems in Stanford's 9-8 loss to UCLA, which dropped the Cardinal into a first-place tie with
the Bruins in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.
