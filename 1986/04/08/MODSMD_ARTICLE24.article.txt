# No date set for Davis' successor

### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
"I'm disappointed. I would
rather not be having this press
conference. But rancor? Ab
solutely not."
Such was the theme of Athletic
Director Andv Geiger's press con
ference yesterday at Maples
Pavilion in the wake of Tom
Davis" decision Sunday to leave
Stanford to become head basket
ball coach at the University of
lowa.
For about 45 minutes, Geiger
spoke with approximately 15
members of the Bay Area media,
first delivering a short statement
and then taking questions.
Throughout the conference,
Geiger stressed that he did not feel
betrayed by Davis, that he has no
quarrels with the Admissions Of
fice and that the search for a new
coach will not be a hasty one.
Geiger also announced that
both Assoc. Head Coach Bruce
Pearl and Asst. Coach Gary Close
had taken assistant positions at
lowa. Asst. Coach Kermit Wash
ington has tentatively decided to
stay at Stanford though, by his
own choice, not on the basketball
staff. He is expected to accept a
job in the Athletic Department.
Although he was obviously not
happy about the departure of
someone he called "a very close
friend." Geiger understood Davis'
decision. "Tom is first and
foremost a basketball coach," he
said. "He feels he can be more
successful with his style of play in
another situation."
Geiger also thanked Davis' for
his four-year stint on the Farm.
"He made it (basketball) impor
tant at the University, and he
made it exciting for people to
come to Maples Pavilion and en
joy the games," Geiger said. "Our
attendance is up. Interest in the
game at Stanford is higher than it's
ever been before, and that's due to
Tom Davis and the young people
that he brought here."

Davis acknowledged Sunday
that the rejection of prep star
Chris Munk had played a role in
his choosing to leave, but Geiger
did not dispute the decision.
"Stanford has an extremely
selective and demanding admis
sions process," he said. "The
process is a good one, a thorough
one and one that deals with each
applicant individually."
While saying that he had begun
to look for another coach, Geiger
denied that there are any definite
candidates for the job. Geiger also
said that candidates will not be an
nounced, but added, "You people
(the press) are usually good at fer
reting out the names. In fact,
sometimes I can get ideas from
you."
Thus far, the rumor mill has
ground out ex-Los Angeles Lakers
and current Loyola-Marymount
Coach Paul Westhead, former
USC Coach Stan Morrison and ex-
University of Utah Coach Jerry
Pimm as possibilities for the Stan
ford job.
According to Geiger, many
people will be involved in the se
lection process, including players,
students, faculty representatives,
admissions officers, members of
the administration and various
outside sources. The final deci
sion, however, will be made by
Geiger and University President
Donald Kennedy.
Geiger does not have a
timetable for choosing a new
coach, but said that one definitely
will not be selected by tomorrow,
which is letter of intent signing day
for high school players. "I would
rather do this well than do this
fast," he said.
Geiger said he hoped that
recruits will not sign letters with
any school until Stanford's coach
ing situation is settled, but added,
"If they are willing to go ahead
and sign with Stanford anyway
even though we don't have a
coach, we obviously will encour
age that."
