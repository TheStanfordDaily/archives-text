						Big Day for tennis as Card meets Bears
## No. 6 men hope for 'animal' effort against No. 13 California at home 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
There's a phenomenon that occurs in high school bas
ketball practices called the "animal drill." And with the
parity that exists this year in college tennis, there are
probably quite a few coaches who are hoping that their
players are "animal" veterans.
During the bizarre drill, two players stand at opposite
ends of the court as the coach rolls the ball across the mid
court line. The object for each player is to get the ball and
score. The only rule is that if you lose, you run laps. Be
cause no fouls are called, it gets a little hairy.
Today's 1:30 p.m. match between visiting 13th-rankcd
California and No. 6 Stanford could get a little hairy itself.
Both teams are coming off weekend 5-4 matches with
USC and UCLA and have to start thinking about berths
in the NCAA tournament.
â€¢ "The main point is there are going to be a lot of
matches like this," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said after
Friday's 5-4 loss to UCLA. "The team that wins the close
ones will win it all. There are going to be so many 5-4
matches that a little extra mental toughness will be the
krey."
Here enters the lesson of the animal drill.
. "The best thing for us was that we had a competitive
weekend," Gould said on Saturday. "We showed some
guts coming back against UCLA and then winning today
(over USC 5-4)."
Meanwhile, across the Bay, California lost two gut
wrenching matches to UCLA and USC, both by a 5-4
score.


Stanford was stretched to the limit in last weekend's matches
against UCLA and USC, falling to the Brnins 5-4 before
heating the Trojans by the same score. Eric Rosenfeld also

split his weekend singles matches, losing to UCLA's Dan
Nahirney and knocking off John Carras of USC. Today the
Cardinal hosts California at 1:30 p.m.
