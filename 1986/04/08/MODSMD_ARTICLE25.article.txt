# A 						Big Day for tennis as Card meets Bears
## No. 6 men hope for 'animal' effort against No. 13 California at home 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
There's a phenomenon that occurs in high school bas
ketball practices called the "animal drill." And with the
parity that exists this year in college tennis, there are
probably quite a few coaches who are hoping that their
players are "animal" veterans.
During the bizarre drill, two players stand at opposite
ends of the court as the coach rolls the ball across the mid
court line. The object for each player is to get the ball and
score. The only rule is that if you lose, you run laps. Be
cause no fouls are called, it gets a little hairy.
Today's 1:30 p.m. match between visiting 13th-rankcd
California and No. 6 Stanford could get a little hairy itself.
Both teams are coming off weekend 5-4 matches with
USC and UCLA and have to start thinking about berths
in the NCAA tournament.
• "The main point is there are going to be a lot of
matches like this," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said after
Friday's 5-4 loss to UCLA. "The team that wins the close
ones will win it all. There are going to be so many 5-4
matches that a little extra mental toughness will be the
krey."
Here enters the lesson of the animal drill.
. "The best thing for us was that we had a competitive
weekend," Gould said on Saturday. "We showed some
guts coming back against UCLA and then winning today
(over USC 5-4)."
Meanwhile, across the Bay, California lost two gut
wrenching matches to UCLA and USC, both by a 5-4
score.


Stanford was stretched to the limit in last weekend's matches
against UCLA and USC, falling to the Brnins 5-4 before
heating the Trojans by the same score. Eric Rosenfeld also

split his weekend singles matches, losing to UCLA's Dan
Nahirney and knocking off John Carras of USC. Today the
Cardinal hosts California at 1:30 p.m.
"Unfortunately we were one short
both times," California Coach Bill
Wright said. "1 hate to see chances to
win — or at least make them squirm
— go by the board like they did. You
can say at least we didn't get beat 9-0,
but that's not a good attitude."
So when the teams take the court,
"mental toughness" may be the de
termining factor.
"I think the fans will see a much
scrappier and hungrier Cardinal team
than they've seen in a while," Gould
said.
Fans will also see a California team
that is much better than the ones that
have visited Stanford in the past few
years.
The Bears are led by junior Steve
DeVries, who was the preseason No.
1-ranked player in the nation.
DeVries now sports a record of 12-9
overall and is currently ranked sixth.
California has been improved by
the arrival of freshmen Woody Hunt
and Alex Nizet. Hunt is ranked 93rd
in the nation and also teams up with
Nizet in the Bears' No. 3 doubles

team.
Cal's lineup is rounded out by
seniors Peter Wright, Harold Hecht
and Chris Schoop, who teams with
DeVries to form the Bears' No. 1
doubles team.
On the other side of the court,
Stanford sophomore Patrick
McEnroe will try to keep his 12-0
record unblemished. Joining him in
the war against the Bears will be
Cardinal senior Dan Goldie.
Goldie, the No. 2 player in the
country, has had the unenviable task
of playing three out of the top five
players in the country over the past
week. Today he gets a little bit ot a
break — he only has to play No. 6
DeVries.
Wright isn't all that excited about
the match today.
"1 don't really want to come down
(for the match)," he said. "Stanford is
too good. 1 don't think the No. 6
ranking indicates how good they are
— I think its ridiculous."
