# Rossides' loss could help Cal halt skid vs. Stanford
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Whether it's testimony to the
quality of the California athletic pro
gram or just a short period of bad
luck, the Golden Bears seem to he
holding a monopoly on not-so-golden
losing streaks against rival schools
these days.
Cal went 26 years before it beat
UCLA in basketball this season, and
the Bears are winless in the last 15
seasons against the Bruins' football
squad.
But it's not just UCLA that has
been haunting the California sports
program. The Bears need only to
look across the Bay to find a team
that they can never defeat — the
Stanford women's tennis team.
That's never, which, in the words of
Ivan Drago, means, "You will lose."
Whether or not the Bears will lose
again when they host the No. 2 Card
inal today at 1:30 p.m., however, is
questionable. The streak may very
well end.
"It's just a matter of time before
they break through," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said. "They're not in
timidated by us anymore."
Up until last season, Cal was
thoroughly intimidated by the Card
inal. The matches were just a for
mality.
Last year, though, the Bears put a
scare into Stanford. "We lost 5-4 in
the third set of the third doubles
match," Cal Coach Jan Brogan said.
"It was a legitimate 5-4," Brennan
added.
This season the Bears have moved
into the women's tennis Top 10, com
piling a 14-3 overall record. One of
the losses was a 5-2 defeat March 5 at
Stanford, but during that match Cal
was without its No. 1 singles player,
Heather Ettus.
The tendinitis-plagued Ettus will

be back in the lineup today, but Cal
will not have the services of freshman
Alissa Finerman, who has
mononucleosis. In the earlier match
between the two teams, Finerman
handed Stanford's Leigh Anne
Eldredge her first loss of the season.
The 11-1 Cardinal has injury prob
lems of its own. Freshman Eleni
Rossides, the team's No. 2 singles
player, has missed the team's last five
matches due to shin splints in both
legs that are very close to stress
fractures, according to Brennan.
Rossides will definitely be lost for
another week and will probably be
out even longer. "I hope I'll be
playing sometime next week, but it
could be a couple of weeks,"
Rossides said. "That's what the doc
tors tell me. The first thing is to make
sure I'm ready for nationals (May 15-
23)."
Brennan indicated that he would

not play Rossides before April 19,
when the Cardinal hosts USC. "I
think we can get by without her," he
said. "We're going to have to."
Sophomore Cari Hagey has been
playing well in place of Rossides.
"We're lucky to have Cari," Brennan
said. "I don't think there's another
school that has our depth."
Brogan predicted that today's
match would be decided in the second
through sixth singles and the doubles.
She said that Ettus will have to play
superbly to defeat the Cardinal's
Patty Fendick in the No. 1 singles
match.
"Fendick is pretty tough to beat,"
Brogan said. "It's not that I don't
have faith in Heather, but she's never
beaten Fendick. But she could."
Stanford could have the edge in the
doubles because Cal's team of Finer
man and Fletcher has been scratched
due to Finerman's illness.
