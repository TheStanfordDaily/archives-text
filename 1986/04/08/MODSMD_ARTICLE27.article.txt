# Spring football begins

Just when it looked like softballs
would continue to terrorize the in
tramural fields, someone men
tioned it to Stanford Coach Jack
Elway, and behold, Stanford foot
ball was born again.
Beginning today, the Cardinal
will begin s[Ving football practice
with the idea of "getting down to
the fundamentals," according to
Stanford wide receivers coach Dave
Baldwin.
"It's (spring practice) a learning
process for us — time to experi
ment," Baldwin said "There are no
opponents, and it gives us the op
portunity to work out bugs.

"It should be very competitive.
There are starting jobs to be won,"
Baldwin added.
Some players, like Brad Muster
and Thomas Henley, should main
tain their prominent roles, yet they
too will experience the effect of
change.
Beginning the spring session,
Muster will practice at tailback — a
switch from last season's fullback
position. Similarly. Henley will
move over to wide receiver.
With Muster at tailback, the full
back position becomes more of a
question mark. Currently, Brian
Morris enters as the top performer,
followed by Marshall Dillard, who
has been saddled by injuries for
most of his career.

On defense, some familiar faces
will return to the field. After sitting
out last season, both Mike Noble
and Dave Wyman will end their
layovers and probably will regain
their starting roles.
A perennial soft spot — the de
fensive secondary — will also be
closely evaluated. With last year's
starters Toi Cook and Walt Harris
playing baseball this spring, fresh
man redshirt Alan Grant and soph
omore Rick Theder will hope to
impress.
A couple of new faces on the de
fensive line could emerge as well.
Baldwin was especially high on the
prospects of redshirt freshmen
Lester Archambeau and Buck Rog
aeman.
