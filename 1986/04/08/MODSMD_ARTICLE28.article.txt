Its six-day southern road trip continued in good fashion
for the Stanford men's volleyball team, as the squad
defeated Loyola Marymount 15-6, 15-4, 11-15, 15-9 last
night. The Cardinal, ranked seventh in the country, is fifth
in the California Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
(CIVA) with a 10-6 record. Loyola fell to 4-12 and ninth
in the 11-team league following the loss.
Stanford lost to undefeated USC, No. 1 in the nation,
last Friday and heat Cal State-Northridge on Saturday.
I he Cardinal is thus assured of at least a split on the four
match trip, which should put Stanford in a good spot in
the league standings going into a three-game season
ending homestand. The squad must hold on to fifth place
in order to make the regionals.
Senior outside hitter Chris Braud totaled 33 kills and a

.355 hitting percentage for Stanford, while junior Stephen
Blue came up with 14 kills and again led the team in hit
tine with a .379 percentage.
"(Steve) Modory set really well," Braun agreed. "I hit
well because Steve was setting perfectly, nice high sets.
John McDermott also played really well; he was a defen
sive asset."
Injuries continue to plague Ail-American Jon Root.
The senior outside hitter reinjured an ankle in practice
last week and has also had shoulder problems. Last night
Root recorded seven kills but had only a .050 average and
did not play in the final game.
Junior Ole Sourlis, a native of Norway and a Maples
Pavilion favorite, led the Lions with 15 kills. The outside
hitter also had a .444 hitting percentage. Henry Bryan led
Loyola in that category, hitting .462. Overall, Stanford
outhit Loyola .304 to .208.
"Loyola traditionally gets excited to play Stanford,"
Braun said. "They feel they have a good chance against
us. They showed tonight they're not a pushover team.

They were pumped to play us. Loyola is an emotional
team. They get one block and the whole team is fired up,
and they play well when they're ahead."
The Cardinal faces UCLA tomorrow night in the final
match of the road trip. The Bruins are 10-5 in CIVA ac
tion and are currently ranked third in the nation. Stanford
fell in five games to UCLA in the teams' first meeting at
Maples earlier this year.
