# Sailors end strong trip with third-place finish

### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
It wasn't the competition, necessarily, that beat the
Stanford sailing team this weekend in its last regatta on
a two-week road trip to the East Coast.
Difficult sailing conditions and frustrating inconsis
tency on the part of sailors made an admirable fifth
place finish at Tufts University quite unsatisfying for
the Cardinal, when it was a mere three points out of
third place.
"We had all sorts of opportunities to capitalize on,"
Stanford Coach Joe Petrucci said. "No one could really
get on track, though."
Missed opportunities and small mistakes hurt
enough to leave the Cardinal close to victory, but not
close enough.
"It was not a great series," Petrucci said. "But
everyone makes mistakes. The regattas are won by the
team who makes the least mistakes."
Boston University took an easy first at Tufts.
Making use of its home-course advantage, Tufts took
second. The next five places were separated by just six

points, with the University of Rhode Island third and
just two points ahead of King's Point. Stanford finished
one point behind King's Point, followed by Boston
College and Harvard tied three points behind the
Cardinal.
The regatta started on Saturday with nothing but
trouble for the Cardinal, as the team of Dan Buckstaff
and Rona Sisson did not sail up to par. They were later
replaced by Rich Bergsend and Irma Rodriguez.
Stanford came into Sunday's races in eighth place
but moved up until it was threatening third. The
regatta basically came down to the last two races.
"Mathematically, we could have taken third after
the last race," Petrucci said. "But it's like shuffling the
dice because no team was consistent."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal could not capitalize on
the situation. "We did not have a great regatta, but it
wasn't a bad regatta," Petrucci said.
This regatta, along with the others on their road trip,
should substantially boost Stanford in the national
rankings. The team was not beaten by a team ranked
below them, and it finished ahead of some schools
ranked above it.
