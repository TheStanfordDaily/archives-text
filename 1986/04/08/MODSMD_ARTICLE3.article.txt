# University land annexation bill postponed
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
A bill aimed at prohibiting neighboring cities
from annexing Stanford property without the
University's approval has been temporarily
postponed after the parties involved agreed to
meet tomorrow and begin attempts to resolve
the issue themselves.
If that meeting proves successful, the bill, in
troduced by Assemblyman Dominic Cortese
(T>-Snn Jose), will not be heard mi its scheduled
date, April 18.
The University is "quite optimistic" about
this attempt to settle the matter without state
legislation, said Andy Doty, director of Com
munity Relations.
The process designed to resolve the annexa
tion issue will include representatives of

Woodside, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, San
Mateo County and the University. Talks could
take a year or longer, Doty said.
The bill generated criticism from local gov
ernment officials, but the University has stead
fastly defended it.
"The goal of the bill was to bring all the par
ties together," Doty said. One of the Univer
sity's desires in the proposed talks is to avoid a
situation in which neighboring cities could an
nex University property and zone it in a way
Thar prevents future ffdhneatk>nal uses, Doty
said.
Currently, land slated for future educational
use is under the jurisdiction either of Santa
Clara County or San Mateo County. While the
University has previously negotiated a contract
with Santa Clara County, no such agreement
exists with San Mateo County.

In Santa Clara County, property owned by
the University and not slated for academic use is
under the respective city's jurisdiction. For ex
ample, Palo Alto has jurisdiction over the Stan
ford Shopping Center. However, the cities in
Santa Clara County cannot annex Stanford
property without the consent of the University.
The University is seeking a similar agreement
with San Mateo County.
One of the obstacles to be overcome before
the two sides reach an agreement is the adjacent
cities' .fear that educational use can include a
wide variety of University projects, like
coliseums, Doty said.
The University is concerned that without an
agreement its property could be split up among
six different jurisdictions — two counties, two
cities and two towns, Doty said.
If communities in San Mateo County were to
annex portions of Stanford land as permitted by

the current law, integrated planning of projects
like the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) would be "all but impossible," Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy wrote in a
March 20 letter to the Assembly Local Govern
ment Committee.
"SLAC's particle beam would start in
Woodside, collide in Menlo Park and then some
of the particles would travel through an under
ground ring in Portola Valley," he wrote.
In addition to limiting the University's op
tions for the future educational use of property,
annexation of its land would cause a duplication
of services to those areas.
"Our view is that competing land considera
tions are better weighed by the county than by
an adjacent municipality which has a strong
vested interest in precludng construction of
facilities needed for the academic enterprise,"
Kennedy wrote.
