# Stanford women bounce back
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
For the first time in 1986, the Stan
ford women's golf team yesterday
displayed the form that had lifted the
team to a No. 3 ranking in the fall,
finishing a strong fourth in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate.
Stanford shot 300 in the second
round and a three-over par 295 in the
third round as a team on the par-73
Villages Golf Course in San Jose to
close at 905, 15 strokes behind tour
ney champion USC.
The Trojans edged out San Jose
State by just one stroke (890-891) to
take the five-team event. U.S. Inter
national University, which was tied
with SJSU as play opened yesterday,
finished at 899, only six strokes ahead
of Stanford.
Long Beach State fell off the pace
early and finished fifth at 926.
Ironically, it was Stanford's play on
its own course in Sunday's opening
round that knocked the Cardinal out
of contention, shooting 310 as a
team. Stanford lost only two strokes
all of yesterday to USC, only three
strokes to SJSU and picked up five
shots on USIU.
"We played exceptionally well
today," Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
said. "(Sunday) was the worst com
petitive round of golf we've played on
our course in four years.
"We've been slumping winter
quarter," Baldwin said. "We didn't
play well in Dallas two weeks ago. It's
the first time we've played really well
since last fall."
Stanford benefited from some ex
ceptional individual rounds yester
day. Kathv Kostas shot 74 in the
morning and 72 in the afternoon to
finish at 225, and Julie Carmichael
added a three-under-par 70 in the
second round to wind up at 221, good

for fifth place in the overall individual
standings.
Adrienne Gilmartin fired a 72 in
the third round to conclude at 231,
and Kay Cornelius, who had
struggled to an 80 Sunday, improved
to a 76 yesterday morning and then to
a 73 in the afternoon (including a
stellar four-under-par 33 on the back
nine) to finish strongly at 229.

USIU's Laurette Maritz captured
the individual title by three strokes
with a five-under-par 214. USC's
Kim Lasken was second, followed by
SJSITs Julie Ralls and Lisa Ipken
danz at 218 and 220, respectively.
The rejuvenated Cardinal now
looks forward to its next tournament,
the Lady Sun Devil in Phoenix April
14-16.
