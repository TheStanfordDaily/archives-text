Cycling
The Stanford cycling team pulled away with a victory
at its own Stanford Criterium last weekend.
In spite of drizzly weather that precipitated
numerous crashes, many spectators were on hand for
the event, which encircled Wilbur and Stern Halls.
In the men's A category race, Brad Chen placed
second, Kayo Ramirez third and Russell Mead sixth.
Johnnie Contreras finished second in the C race.
Stanford's Pam Stevenson won the women's race,
while Jennifer Hubbert and Laura Rodman came in
fourth and fifth, respectively, in addition to garnering
several "prime" points.
Sunday, Stanford hosted a 28-mile road race in Pes
cadero. Again, cyclists from California, UC-Santa Bar
bara, San Diego, UC-Davis, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
and many other schools competed. Eric Saltzman won
the A race, which was two laps, in a sprint. Other riders
scoring points for Stanford included Mike Fadich, Tom
McMinn, Tom Moyer, Annika Olson and Rodman.
The Stanford cyclists started quickly this season with
some early victories during Spring Break. Stanford
won the 40-mile Sutter Butte Road Race and did well
at the Friant Dam Road Race. Mead won the A race at

the former, while Saltzman won for Stanford at the lat
ter. Rodman won both for the Stanford women.
Stanford was outscored by Cal Poly at two races in
Fresno, including the Tollhouse Hill Climb Time Trial.
Strong riders for Stanford that weekend were Art
Walker, Saltzman, Fadich, Moyer, Bob Borthers, Rod
man, Amy Plaut and Michelle Stubbs.
Stanford travels to Santa Barbara this weekend for
two more races.
Ice Hockey
San Jose broke a 5-5 tie with 45 seconds remaining
and then scored an open-net goal to defeat the Stan
ford A hockey team 7-5 last weekend.
Despite the loss, the Cardinal qualified for the Cal
Nevada Hockey League playoffs taking place next
weekend in Reno. Stanford will play Belmont in the
opening round Saturday at noon.
Also in the playoffs are teams from Berkeley and
Stockton. The Berkeley team, which is funded by the
university, consists mainly of "hotshots from the East
Bay," not Cal students, according to Stanford Coach
Paul Estes. Berkeley is the favorite to win the playoffs.
