Shultz, ambassador plan summit
WASHINGTON — Anatoly Dobrynin, winding up his 24-year career
as Soviet ambassador, conferred yesterday with Secretary of State
George Shultz about plans and timing for the next U.S.-Soviet summit
meeting in the clearest signal yet that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
intends to keep his commitment to visit the United States this year.
A U.S. official said the focus of the 90-minute meeting, also attended
by White House national security adviser John Poindexter, was almost
entirely on the next summit between President Reagan and Gorbachev.
"It was a major substantive notice by the Soviets that they are ready to
talk about a summit date," the official, who declined to be identified,
said. "It is virtually certain that this is the signal he (Gorbachev) is com
ing. After that, it is down to mechanics."
Dobrynin, promoted March 6 to a major foreign policy post in the
Communist Party, meets today with Reagan at the White House. The
U.S. official said a firm date for the next summit may be set during that
meeting. If the two sides cannot agree on specific timing, he added, they
probably will set an approximate date that would permit preliminary
work to get started.
The official said the most likely date for the summit was sometime in
November.
He said June and July, once Washington's preferred months, now ap
pear very unlikely because there just is not enough time to make
preparations. August has been ruled out because it is a vacation month
both in the United States and the Soviet Union, and Reagan has said he
does not want to hold the meeting in September or October because it
might interfere with the congressional election campaign.
Bush affirms oil market differences
DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — Vice President Bush wound up a three
day visit to Saudi Arabia yesterday by stressing continuing U.S.-Saudi
differences over the state of the oil market and saying the two sides had
"not really" found any common ground on the issue during his talks with
King Fahd and other officials.
At a press conference here following a 2 1/2-hour meeting with the
king late Sunday night, Bush went out of his way to make clear that a
sharp divergence of viewpoints separated the United States and Saudi
Arabia on the question of oil pricing despite their "enormous common
interests" in other areas.
"I've talked to the Saudis very frankly about it,"he said. "I've made it
clear to them that I did not think that U.S. interests and Saudi interests
were the same."
Observers were surprised by the emphasis he appeared to place on the
U.S.-Saudi dispute over oil pricing policy.
Bush, who has repeatedly expressed his concern about the damaging
effects of the recent collapse of prices on the American oil industry, said
that while the Saudis favored the "highest possible prices" the United
States wanted "the lowest possible prices consistent with the fact that we
need a strong domestic oil industry for our national security."
Bush said he did not know what the ideal figure for a barrel of oil
might be today. He also insisted that he had made no specific request of
Fahd on pricing and had not come on a price-fixing mission to Saudi
Arabia.
"The best way to sort it out is the market," he remarked.
Saudi authorities, who were known to be upset by Bush's first com
ments on the subject last week in Washington, have remained silent on
their own views during his visit.
When Bush expressed concern about the damaging effects on U.S. in
dustry of the oil price collapse, White House officials said the Adminis
tration remained committed to a free-market approach. In his comments
to the Saudis, Bush appeared to be reflecting both the free-market
policy of the president, and his own concern about the impact on Ameri
can oil producers.
White House aides said last week that Bush had stated his concern
about the U.S. producers in terms that went beyond official administra
tion policy. That policy, they said, is to express sympathy for U.S. pro
ducers but not suggest any action to interfere with world oil markets.
Filipinos focus on economic aid
MANILA, Philippines — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and
President Corazon Aquino agreed yesterday that the United States
should concentrate on economic aid in its support of the new govern
ment of the Philippines.
In a closed meeting, Aquino told Weinberger that the country, with at
least one in five Filipinos out of work, needs large-scale assistance to
create jobs, according to presidential spokesman Rene Saguisag.
"Certainly the emphasis has to be on economic aid," Weinberger told
an airport news conference after his busy morning of meetings with
Aquino and other Philippine leaders. "We will offer the things that the
Aquino government feels are essential to have."
He added, however, that "I think that it's necessary to have some mili
tary assistance to continue on with the reorganization, strengthening and
modernization of the Philippine armed forces that has been started so
successfully."
President Reagan has requested a total Philippine aid package of $228
million in the next budget year, $125 million for economic aid and the
remainder for military assistance. The allotment is part of a five-year
agreement signed by Reagan and former President Ferdinand Marcos to
provide the Philippines with $900 million in military and economic aid
through 1991 in exchange for unlimited U.S. access to Subic Bay Naval
Base and Clark Air Base.
Despite budget-cutting sentiments in Congress, Weinberger said,
there is a "reservoir of good will at home that will translate into very tan
gible aid" for the Philippines. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) also said
during a visit to Manila last week that such aid would receive bipartisan
congressional support.
China allows British ships to visit
PEKING — China has given Britain the go-ahead to send two British
navy ships on a goodwill visit to Shanghai in July, a Foreign Ministry of
ficial said yesterday.
The move could set a precedent for the first U.S. Navy visit to China
in nearly four decades, some observers said.
The United States and China failed to reach final agreement on an an
ticipated U.S. Navy visit to Shanghai last year after Communist Party
General Secretary Hu Yaobang said that U.S. ships would not be carry
ing nuclear weapons when they made the port call. Hu and a senior
Foreign Ministry official indicated in an interview that the U.S. govern
ment had given assurances to this effect. U.S. officials immediately
denied any change in the U.S. policy of refusing to confirm or deny
whether U.S. ships carry nuclear weapons.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry official would not say today whether
the Chinese had asked for assurances from the British as to whether
their ships would carry nuclear weapons. But the British have the same
policy of neither confirming nor denying when it comes to this issue. It
appeared in this case that China had sought no such assurances.
The Foreign Ministry official said it was China's policy "not to allow
foreign military vessels with nuclear weapons to visit China."
Asked yesterday whether this cleared the way for an American port
call, the Foreign Ministry official said, "We've got to wait and see.
We've got nothing on that."
During a visit here last week, Norman Lamont, Britain's Minister of
state for defense procurement, said Britain was adhering to its policy of
neither confirming nor denying whether its vessels carried nuclear arms.
