# U.S. links Libya to bombing
## 
### 
BERLIN — U.S. Ambassador to West Germany
Richard Burt said yesterday, "There is very clear
evidence that there is Libyan involvement" in a dis
cotheque bombing here last Saturday that left an
American soldier dead and 64 other Americans
among the injured.
Burt made his comments in Bonn in an interview
on NBC TV's "Today" show.
An American official here, elaborating on Burt's
comments, claimed that investigators have gath
ered "hard evidence" that Libyan agents were re
sponsible for the bombing and said the Libyans
operated through the People's Bureau in East Ber
lin, which represents Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafi's government in the East German capital.
The official provided no further details, however,
on what he meant by "hard evidence" and it
remained unclear whether the evidence showed
direct Libyan involvement in the bombing or the
use of German or other foreign agents.
U.S. authorities have anticipated a Libyan ter
rorist strike since fighting erupted between the two
countries in the Gulf of Sidra on March 24 and 25.
The West German government yesterday dis
tanced itself from assertions of Libyan involvement
in the incident, although it left open the possibility
that foreigners played a role. One West German
official, voicing caution, said that the link between
Libya and the bombing is "not completely clear."
The ongoing investigation has not firmly traced

the bomb to West German or foreign terrorists, a
West German Interior Ministry spokesman said in
a Bonn press conference yesterday. Spokesman
Hans-Guenter Kowalski said, however, that the
bombing followed a pattern of earlier attacks
against Americans in other countries. He added
that there was no evidence that West German left
wing urban guerrillas might have been involved.
"We have strong suspicions, but no proof' that
Libyans planted the bomb, a Foreign Ministry offi
cial said in a telephone interview.
A West German police task force, which includes
U.S. military authorities, is investigating the bomb
ing, but there are reports that U.S. security officials
are conducting a separate investigation.
If Libya's involvement can be documented, "We
are fully prepared to take the proper counter
measures," the Foreign Ministry official added.
"We remain in close contact with the Americans."
On Sunday, following consultations between
Burt and senior West German authorities. Foreign
Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher formed a com
mission to investigate the possibility of foreign gov
ernment involvement in the bomb attack. In a
statement issued in Bonn, Genscher said that
proper actions would be taken if the commission's
findings are positive.
The West German government already has
responded to the recent rise in terrorist activity in
Europe by stepping up surveillance of the Libyan

mission in Bonn, heavily scrutinizing incoming
Libyans and other Arabs at the borders, and
upgrading protection of U.S. facilities across the
country. But unlike France, Bonn has not yet ex
pelled Libyan diplomats.
The Reagan Administration called on western
European governments last Saturday to oust
Libyan representatives to help control terrorist ac
tions.
Effective control of terrorism in West Berlin
would require cooperation of the East Berlin and
Soviet governments, diplomats here said.
"The border is not very well policed," one west
ern diplomat suggested. Diplomats commuting
from East Berlin are routinely whisked across the
border without even perfunctory checks of the cars,
the diplomat said.
Libya, a Soviet ally, maintains one of its largest
foreign missions in the East German capital, with
more than 30 diplomats, according to sources here.
Libya does not have official representation in
West Berlin, which remains under French, British
and U.S. authority, according to post-World War II
agreements.
Senior East German official Gunter Mittag and
West German officials in Bonn are expected to dis
cuss the policing of the border between East and
West Berlin, among other issues, when they meet
in the West German capital this week, West Ger
man sources said.
