# Contadora peace talks fall apart
## 
### 
PANAMA CITY — Three days of
talks to revive the sagging Contadora
peace negotiations collapsed in disar
ray yesterday over Nicaragua's insis
tence on an end to U.S.-sponsored
guerrilla attacks as a condition for
peace in Central America.
The display of regional discord
came as the House of Representa
tives prepares to renew debate on a
Reagan Administration proposal for
$100 million in mostly military aid to
anti-Sandinista rebels fighting to
overthrow the government in
Managua. It marked a setback for op
ponents to the aid here and in Wash
ington who hoped the Contadora
talks could be held up as an alterna
tive.
Foreign ministers who participated
in the discussions here insisted the
outcome does not spell the end of the
Contadora forum for Central Ameri
can peace efforts under way since a

January 1983 meeting on Contadora
Island off Panama. But their failure
even to commit themselves to a
future date for a final agreement cast
the Latin American initiative in a
particularly negative light at what a
number of diplomats described as a
critical juncture for the region.
The Contadora nations — Colom
bia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela
— sought to put the best face on their
efforts with a communique calling on
all five Central American govern
ments to answer within eight days
whether they are prepared to
"reinitiate immediately" negotiations
on unresolved issues in a proposed
peace treaty. The treaty would curb
the military buildup in Central
America by limiting the number of
foreign military advisers and military
maneuvers involving foreign troops,
and reducing levels of soldiers and
armaments. The draft proposal also

calls for an end to aid by governments
in the region to "irregular forces"
fighting other Central American gov
ernments.
The Contadora nations were joined
in the appeal by Argentina, Brazil,
Peru and Uruguay, the so-called
"support group" whose foreign min
isters attended to add weight to the
gathering.
The appeal amounted to a chal
lenge to Nicaragua's Sandinista lead
ership to change its mind. Diplomats
from a variety of countries said
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto
refused through the full three days of
talks to commit Nicaragua to sign the
treaty without simultaneous steps to
bring an end to the U.S.-supported
guerrilla war in Nicaragua.
The foreign ministers of Honduras,
El Salvador and Costa Rica issued a
separate document, labeled the
"Panama Commitment," pledging in

tensive negotiations leading to sign
ing of the Contadora draft treaty by
June 6. After prolonged talks here,
they walked away from efforts at a
compromise with Nicaragua, saying
the Nicaraguan demand falls outside
the Contadora framework. "I don't
have anything left to discuss, my
friend," said Vice President Rodolfo
Castillo Claramount of El Salvador,
who is also foreign minister.
D'Escoto blamed the lack of agree
ment on the United States. The Con
tadora effort can move forward only
"in the spirit and framework of the
Caraballeda document," he said.
This referred to a declaration last
January calling for an end to
"political, logistical or military sup
port to groups that try to subvert or
destabilize constitutional order in
Latin American states through force
or any terrorist acts of any kind."
