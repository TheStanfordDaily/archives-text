Court denies trial rights
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
stressing there is no constitutional right to a
"perfect" trial, ruled yesterday that improperly
denying a defendant the right to adequately
cross-examine a prosecution witness does not al
ways mean a conviction must be reversed.
In a 7-2 decision, the justices overturned a
Delaware court decision that said reversal must
be automatic in such circumstances. The Su
preme Court said that while restrictions on cross
examination in this case violated the right to con
front an accuser, a conviction still may stand if
the error did not effect the verdict.
"The constitution entitles a criminal defen
dant to a fair trial, not a perfect one," Justice
William Rehnquist wrote for the court. ". . .An
otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside
if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the
whole record, that the constitutional error was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."
The well-established "harmless error"
doctrine, Rehnquist noted, recognizes that the
central purpose of a trial is to determine guilt or
innocence — focusing on the overall fairness of
the trial "rather than on the virtually inevitable
presence of immaterial error."
In other action, the justices:
• Let stand an appeals court ruling upholding a
subpoena that required the lawyer for accused
racketeer Anthony Colombo to testify before a
federal grand jury investigating Colombo's role
in organized crime.
The increasing use of such subpoenas has been
under widespread attack by defense lawyers who
say it undermines the confidential relationship
between attorney and client. By one count, some
400 such subpoenas have been issued in recent
months.
• Refused to hear an appeal contending that Los

Angeles County firefighter-hiring practices in
stituted in 1979 discriminated against black and
Latino applicants. In a brief order, the justices
left intact a ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals in San Francisco that rejected a chal
lenge to the hiring procedures by attorneys
representing unsuccessful minority applicants.
The appeals court held that while the county's
written exam may have had some adverse impact
on minorities, the plaintiffs had failed to show the
test was not sufficiently related to the require
ments of the job.
House faces contra vote
WASHINGTON — Congress returns to work
today following a lengthy Easter recess still
facing major disputes over the two issues that
have dominated the legislative session this year
— U.S. policy in Central America and President
Reagan's fiscal 1987 budget proposals.
The House Rules Committee is scheduled to
meet Thursday to set the stage for a resumption
next week of the debate over the Administra
tion's request for $100 million in aid to the
Nicaraguan counterrevolutionaries, known as
contras, who are fighting the Sandinista govern
ment.
Meanwhile, Congress appears certain to miss
its April 15 deadline for adoption of a fiscal 1987
budget under the new Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
budget-balancing law as Senate Republicans
struggle behind the scenes for a consensus on the
issue.
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.),
caught in a crossfire between the Senate Budget
Committee and the White House, has indicated
he will spend this week if not longer in consulta
tions aimed at reaching an accommodation. But
prospects appear bleak, and no date for Senate

action on the budget has been set.
The Administration is seeking $70 million in
military aid and $30 million in nonlethal
"humanitarian" assistance for the contra rebels.
The House, by a vote of 222 to 210, rejected the
aid package on March 20, but seven days later
the Senate narrowly approved a slightly modified
version of the aid request.
The Senate-passed measure would delay
release of $75 million of the aid for 90 days while
the United States sought to arrange regional
peace negotiations. However, the $25 million
provided immediately to the contras would in
clude funds for military training and defensive
weapons, including surface-to-air missiles.
There is a widespread assumption in Congress
that some form of contra aid will be enacted, with
the main debate centering on what restrictions
will be imposed. The House Democratic leader
ship has pledged to hold a second vote on the
issue April 15 during consideration of the fiscal
1986 supplemental appropriations bill.
Stocks fall for third day
NEW YORK — The stock market recorded its
third straight loss yesterday as oil prices contin
ued to rebound from their early-1986 slide.
But the market finished well above its midday
lows. Trading set the slowest pace in more than
two months.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down about 20 points at midsession, closed with
a 3.71 loss at 1,735.51.
Analyst John Foster said the wise investor
should look to American investments in France
for the best long term gain. The pro-capitalist
shift of the newly elected Balladur government
will bolster U.S. financial interests, the world
renowned economist further stated.
