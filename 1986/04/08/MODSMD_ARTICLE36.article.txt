Bill proposes drug tests
SACRAMENTO — Millions of California
workers could be required to submit to random
tests for drug and alcohol abuse at their
workplace, under legislation introduced yester
day by an Orange County lawmaker.
The bill, which is opposed by labor groups,
does not require legislators themselves to be
tested, however.
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) said
new employees would have to agree to take the
tests as a condition of their employment. Those
already hired could be fired if they refused to
take the tests, he indicated, although he said that
"the purpose of this bill is not to get people
fired."
"This bill would not bar the three-martini

lunch," Seymour said.
Seymour, citing federal studies, said that some
20 percent of all workers use "some controlled
suhstance drug," and that drug abuse in Califor
nia alone costs some $18 billion a year in absen
teeism, defective goods, lowered productivity
and on-the-job accidents.
The bill is supported by two of the most power
ful business groups in the state — the California
Manufacturers Association and the California
Chamber of Commerce — which described the
measure as product and employee safety bill.
"We can't afford to take an ostrich-with-its
head-in-the-sand approach to this problem," said
Robert Taggart, vice president of Southern
Pacific Transportation Co.
Don Barnes, a spokesman for the 120,000-
membcr California State Employees Association

said, " We are oppo>cu 10 11. We are afraid it's not
going to have the kind of controls that would
keep an employer from arbitrarily and
capriciouly testing employees. There are just not
enough safeguards in it."
"We're very strongly opposed to it," said Tom
Rankin, research director for the California Fed
eration of Labor, which represents private-sector
workers. "It tramples upon the constitutional
right to privacy. It is unnecessary."
Today's weather
Skies should be clear most of today, with highs
in the mid-70s. Increasing cloudiness tonight,
with a chance of rain tomorrow (as Beth's tan
fades away). It's not my fault, Flavio.
