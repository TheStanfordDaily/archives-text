# Prof.: secrecy may do harm

The director of Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Labo
ratory (SSRL) said yesterday that although he supports
Stanford's restriction on classified research, the policy will
hurt the University and the nation.
Arthur Bienenstock said in an interview that it is
"critical for universities to stay away from classified re
search . . . because it is inconsistent with their basic
goals." But he noted that the government, hoping to con
duct classified research at all top U.S. laboratories, will
build its finest facilities at national laboratories rather
than major research universities.
"Graduate students will be less effectively educated,
and the weapons program will be hurt," Bienenstock said.
"In the long run, the nation will suffer."
He said also that the government already suffers be

cause it cannot conduct classified research at SSRL or the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
"There is no facility in the nation that compares with
the combined capabilities of SLAC and SSRL in terms of
producing synchrotron radiation," he said.
Bienenstock said that if SSRL were to conduct classi
fied work in the future, it should be people from outside
the University rather than faculty, staff and students who
do that research.
The goal of a university is to promote a general under
standing of science, he said. "I and my colleagues prefer
that role."
He said SSRL is not in danger of jeopardizing the Uni
versity's classification restriction despite a new U.S. De
partment of Energy policy that allows the government to
conduct classified work at any major new facility that it
funds.
The DOE policy, he said, "will ap
ply to new major unique facilities. We
just expect to further develop existing
facilities."
Bienenstock noted that a major ex
perimental facility — a storage ring
— proposed to the government by

Stanford would in fact be constructed
at Argonne National Laboratory in
Illinois rather than at the University.
The storage ring points up the gov
ernment's desire to build its top re
search facilities at national
laboratories, he said.
