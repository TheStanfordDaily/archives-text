# Cal students to blockade building
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Anti-apartheid protesters plan to blockade a
UC-Bcrkeley administration building this morning,
an action which should prompt more arrests in the
increasingly violent demonstrations there.
Organizers expect as many as 1,000 students to
take part in this morning's human blockade of Cali
fornia Hall, which houses the university chancel
lor's office.
"We want to shut down the building because
business as usual is not morally tolerable when
business as usual means investing $2.4 million in
South Africa-related firms," said Berkeley senior
Paul Hess, a spokesman for the Campaign Against
Apartheid.
Apartheid foes held a noon rally and all-day
teach-in at California Hall yesterday, focusing at
tention on apartheid in South Africa and what they
consider apartheid-like policies at the Big Moun
tain Indian Reservation in Arizona.

Hess said protesters are reaffirming their rights
to freedom of speech by having teach-ins and sit
ins.
UC officials had sought to limit protesters' civil
disobedience by obtaining a court order blocking
protests last week, but an Alameda County Super
ior Court judge ruled that the university's request
was too broad and agreed to prohibit only protests
that caused fire hazards or disrupted the educa
tional process.
Today's blockade comes against the backdrop of
increasing dissension among Berkeley's leading
anti-apartheid groups, according to sources close to
the groups.
Sources say the United People of Color are push
ing for more confrontational protests, like
blockades and the rebuilding of shanties, while the
Campaign Against Apartheid favors peaceful
demonstrations.
Hess, however, said the groups are joining to
gether, adding that their differences have been un
fairly accentuated as they try to to work with one

another.
"This stuff about splits is not really an issue," he
said, "because when yOu try to work together it's
harder. It gets played up that it's split, when it's
really more unified. Working together can give the
opposite appearance."
In other divestment protests this week, two dem
onstrators were arrested on the lawn of the Wis
consin state capitol Sunday as they tried to rebuild
shanties that were ripped down by police the night
before.
The arrests in Madison came after demonstrators
tried to take scraps of wood to a site where police
had dismantled shanties Friday and Saturday
nights, resulting in 17 arrests.
The dismantling of a shanty also sparked arrests
Saturday at Purdue University in West Lafayette,
Ind., while protesters at Yale University continued
to occupy their shacks.
The Yale protesters received permission to leave
six shanties standing until Saturday, when the
school's governing board is to meet.
