# 3 seniors earn Gardner honor
## Features 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Staff writer 
For former Daily Editor in
Chief Troy Eid, deciding what to
do after graduation was as simple
as copy editing at The Daily.
At a loss as to what to do next
year, Eid recalled reading an arti
cle that appeared in The Daily in

Feature

late January. The story spotlighted
a recent Stanford graduate who
was involved in public service
thanks to the Gardner Fellowship.
Eid will have to grow used to
reading stories about himself, be
cause recently he was selected as a
1986 Gardner Fellow, along with
classmates Donna Anderson and
Liz Butler.
The Gardner Fellowship Pro
gram, inaugurated last year, is a
joint program with UC-Berkeley
providing six graduating seniors
(three from each campus) with a
stipend of as much as $12,500 to
spend one year working with a
mentor of their choice in the
public sector.
For Eid, the fellowship is an
ideal opportunity to explore and
focus his myriad career alterna
tives.
"The Gardner is a great
springboard from which to enter
public service. It will give me a

good idea about what I want to do
in the public sector," Eid said.
When applying for the fellow
ship, students are asked to identify
which areas of public service they
would like to pursue. Once selec
ted, the recipients work closely
with the selection committee and
staff to match their interests with a
corresponding public servant.
Last year's recipients are cur
rently working for Mayor Henry
Cisneros of San Antonio, Texas, in
the office of Senator Gary Hart
(D-Colo.) and for Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D-Ind.).
Eid is a Slavic studies and
literature major. As a Gardner
Fellow, he said that he intends to
research the growing technology
in the telephone and broadcasting
industries.
Eid's interest in communica
tions technology stems from the
potential impact it could have on
human rights conditions in the So
viet Union and elsewhere, and he
speculated that human rights vio
lations throughout the world will
be challenged in the years to come
by the rapidly growing innovations
in technology.
He cited new technology that
allows foreign countries to broad
cast programs via satellite. Since a
large and growing number of
Soviets have television sets in their
homes, this technology could eventually have
a direct and profound effect on the population
there, he said.
"What these technological innovations
might be able to do is to break down the bar
riers to communication with and within the
Soviet Union," Eid said.
Eid said that he believes this growth in
technology may ultimately change the
hierarchy of Soviet society, which he said is
based first and foremost on the government's
control of information.
His interest in human rights was kindled
after working for Rep. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.).
Working both in Wirth's district office and in

'The Gardner Fellow
ship is going to give
me some tremendous
experience.'
— Donna Anderson

the representative's office on Capitol Hill,
Eid's work focused primarily on human rights
issues.
As part of his duties in Wirth's office, Eid
drafted a House Concurrent Resolution that
called on Soviet officials to allow Soviet dissi
dents Andrei Sakharov and Ylena Bonner "to
live in the country of their choice."
The resolution, which was cosponsored by
Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.) was passed
unanimously.
While at Stanford, Eid has pursued this in
terest in human rights, working as an activist
for the Berkeley-based Scientists for Sak
harov, Orlov and Shcharansky (SOS), a group
that tries to gain the release of prisoners of
conscience throughout the world.
Eid said that his most exciting experience
with SOS was the opportunity to help organ
ize a press conference in August 1984 for
Tatanya Yankelevich, stepdaughter of Sak
harov, and three Nobel laureates.
The Washington, D.C. conference was
carried on the Cable News Network and
received front-page news coverage in papers
across the nation, including the Los Angeles
Times.
Eid said that he thinks The Daily plays a vi
tal public service role by "keeping the com
munity informed, providing a forum for the
exchange of opinion and training journalists

from different academic disciplines."
He also said that he hopes the Gardner Fel
lowship will allow him to work in an agency
such as the Federal Communications Com
mission. Ideally, he said that he would like to
be involved in domestic and international
communication policy.
"There is a tremendous opportunity, with
emerging telecommunications technology, to
ease tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union," he said.
After enjoying the Gardner Fellowship,
Eid said that he plans to attend law school at
the University of Washington and possibly
seek elective office.
Liz Butler has also been honored as a 1986
Gardner Fellow. Butler said she was "really
surprised" when she learned that she had won
the fellowship, but also enthusiastic about the
possibilities it had to offer.
"I am very interested in going into public
service and this is a perfect opportunity for
that," she said.
Butler said that she is is looking forward to
working for someone — preferably in Wash
ington D.C. — who deals with children's
health issues, especially in low-income areas.
Butler's interest in children's health was
aroused by her major, human biology. Her
concentration within the major is infant and
pre-natal health.
For her human biology internship (required
for the major), Butler worked for a southern
California group called STOP-GAP, a non
profit psychotherapy organization that
develops therapy programs for hospitals,
community centers and retirement homes.
Butler's involvement included not only the
development and execution of these therapy
sessions, but also the development of a com
munity outreach program that was designed
to raise money and increase publicity for
STOP-GAP.
"It helped me get a much better under
standing of what it means to be in a non-profit
organization," Butler said. "I did a great deal
of things I would not have otherwise been
able to do."
Butler's experience at STOP-GAP was
made possible by the Public Service Center's
summer fellowship program. The summer fel
lowship allowed her to develop the internship
program and receive enough funding to make
possible the opportunity with STOP-GAP.
Since serving as a summer fellow, she ha&
become coordinator of the Public Service
Center's summer fellowship program. As co
ordinator she helps potential applicants refine
their ideas and directs them to possible proj
ects.
In addition to these programs, Butler has
been involved in other public service ventures
at Stanford, including the annual "You Can
Make a Difference" conference and student
research with ARLO.
Currently, Butler is a resident assistant in
Branner Hall, where she is founder of their
Adopt-a-Grandparent program. This pro
gram allows Branner students to take weekly
visits to a nearby convalescent home.
"It has been a good opportunity for stu
dents who are considering a pre-medical

degree. Some have really been awakened to
the realities of medicine as a profession,"
Sutler said.
Butler also coordinates Branner's Reach
Out Today program, a quarterly event spon
sored by the Stanford Volunteer Network.
Last quarter, she and about 75 Branner stu
dents spent a day working at a community
center in East Palo Alto as part of the pro
gram.

'I am very interested in going into public
service and this is the perfect opportunity for
that.'
— 1986 Gardner Fellow Liz Butler

"It is rewarding for me to see the kids of
East Palo Alto having a good time. It keeps
me from taking things for granted so much,"
said Butler.
Butler called the Gardner Fellowship "a
unique opportunity. I wouldn't have the op
portunity to work with the caliber of people I
will be [working with] right out of school
without the Gardner Fellowship."
After spending a year working on children's
health care issues in Washington, D.C., Butler

said that she plans to attend graduate school
in health policy management. Eventually, she
said, she would like to work in the public sec
tor on public health issues.
Fellowship recipient Donna Anderson
heard about the opportunity provided by the
Gardner Fellowship Program from her advi
ser in political science, David Abernethy.
"I was academically put out. I wanted to
put public policy and political science to a

more applied use," Anderson said.
She stressed that the fellowship would al
low her to gain some valuable experience. "I
am tired of working on theory, I want to see it
applied," she said.
Anderson is a political science major with
an emphasis on ethnic and feminist studies.
At Stanford, she has combined her academic
work with her interests in politics in her posi
tions as Black Student Union treasurer and
ASSU Deputy Senate Chair.

As a member of the senate, Anderson was
active in the debate over the advantages and
disadvantages of ethnic theme houses on
campus. In addition, Anderson helped organ
ize the recent forum on racism held in Dinkei
spiel Auditorium.
Outside of Stanford, Anderson has spent
two summers working with the state Assem
bly in Sacramento.
As a Gardner Fellow, she said that she
hopes to get the opportunity to work with a
state public official in California who is activfe
in ethnic and feminist issues.
"The Gardner Fellowship is going to give
me some tremendous experience. It will give
me the best exposure to people fresh out of
college," Anderson said.
In addition to the Gardner Fellowship, An
derson has been honored as a Sloan Fellow,
which will allow her to pursue a master's in
public policy at UC-Berkeley following her
fellowship.
All three seniors now have to choose some
one in the public sector with whom they can
serve their fellowship.
Jeanne Halleck serves as the director of the
Gardner Fellowship Program at Stanford. It is
her job to administer the selection process as
well as work with the recipients to identify
and Contact potential mehfdts. *
"I'm very pleased" with this year's
recipients, Halleck said. "It is rewarding to do
this kind of work."
Currently, Halleck is working with the
three recipients in selecting mentors in the
public sector.
"This is a very important opportunity in
their lives, as it will prohaM> influence their
careers and lives to corn**.' Hi eck said.
