For former Daily Editor in
Chief Troy Eid, deciding what to
do after graduation was as simple
as copy editing at The Daily.
At a loss as to what to do next
year, Eid recalled reading an arti
cle that appeared in The Daily in

Feature

late January. The story spotlighted
a recent Stanford graduate who
was involved in public service
thanks to the Gardner Fellowship.
Eid will have to grow used to
reading stories about himself, be
cause recently he was selected as a
1986 Gardner Fellow, along with
classmates Donna Anderson and
Liz Butler.
The Gardner Fellowship Pro
gram, inaugurated last year, is a
joint program with UC-Berkeley
providing six graduating seniors
(three from each campus) with a
stipend of as much as $12,500 to
spend one year working with a
mentor of their choice in the
public sector.
For Eid, the fellowship is an
ideal opportunity to explore and
focus his myriad career alterna
tives.
"The Gardner is a great
springboard from which to enter
public service. It will give me a

good idea about what I want to do
in the public sector," Eid said.
When applying for the fellow
ship, students are asked to identify
which areas of public service they
would like to pursue. Once selec

with the selection committee and
staff to match their interests with a
corresponding public servant.
Last year's recipients are cur
rently working for Mayor Henry
Cisneros of San Antonio, Texas, in
the office of Senator Gary Hart
(D-Colo.) and for Rep. Lee
Hamilton (D-Ind.).
Eid is a Slavic studies and
literature major. As a Gardner
Fellow, he said that he intends to
research the growing technology
in the telephone and broadcasting
industries.
Eid's interest in communica
tions technology stems from the
potential impact it could have on
human rights conditions in the So
viet Union and elsewhere, and he
speculated that human rights vio
lations throughout the world will
be challenged in the years to come
by the rapidly growing innovations
in technology.
He cited new technology that
allows foreign countries to broad
cast programs via satellite. Since a
large and growing number of
Soviets have television sets in their
