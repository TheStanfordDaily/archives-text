# Speaker: U.S. should change demands for Philippine bases
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
The United States should change bargaining strategy
regarding its two military bases in the Philippines, accord
ing to Manuel Gaspay, a doctoral candidate at the Food
Research Institute and a Filipino.
The U.S. government needs to recognize Philippine
sovereignty and conduct negotiations equitably rather
than bargaining from a position of strength, Gaspay said
yesterday at the Bechtel International Center.
The U.S.-Philippines treaty on the two bases is up for
renegotiation in 1996.
When the military base treaty was first negotiated in
1947, the United States took advantage of post-war con
fusion and a perception of many Filipinos that the United
States liberated their nation from the oppressive occupa
tion of the Japanese during World War 11, according to
Gaspay. The result was a treaty that benefited the United
States at the expense of the Philippines, he said.
The treaty was modified in later years to include an eco
nomic aid package, regarded by Filipinos as rent pay
ments for the U.S. bases, reduction in the number of bases
from six to two and the symbolic appointment of a
Filipino joint commander in chief for the bases, according
to Gaspay.
The United States should review its needs for the bases
— the largest U.S. military facilities outside the nation —
and be willing to compromise, he said.
According to Gaspay, the U.S. government argues that
the bases are strategically important for the United States
"because they extend defensive capabilites beyond ter

ritorial boundaries."
"Is it morally correct to insist on U.S. interests over
Philippine interests?" Gaspay asked, noting that the U.S.
government should ask itself that question.
He called on both governments to encourage public
education and discussion of the issues surrounding U.S.
military bases in the Philippines, asking: "Are these
(security interests) real interests of the U.S. public or just
of the U.S. Department of State?"
Only the military establishment in the Philippines wants
to keep the bases, while most Filipinos are anxious to rid
their nation of the U.S. military presence, according to
Gaspay.
Calling them "a dagger at the throat of Philippine
sovereignty," Gaspay said, "The bases serve as a justifica
tion for U.S. meddling in Philippine affairs."
The imperialist attitude of the United States toward the
Philippines have prevented Filipinos from gaining real po
litical independence, according to Gaspay, who cited U.S.
support of Ferdinand Marcos' government for 20 years
despite Filipino opposition as an example of U.S. inter
ference.
Rather than preserving peace in the region by serving as
a deterrent to unfriendly nations, the bases threaten the
Philippines with "involvement in U.S military actions, as
during World War II," Gaspay said.
The Philippines was ravaged by fighting between the
United States and Japan during the war.
The few economic benefits provided by the bases are
"offset by the social costs and the impact on the nation as
a whole, as exemplified by prostitution" and the damaging
effects of U.S. imperialism, Gaspay said.
