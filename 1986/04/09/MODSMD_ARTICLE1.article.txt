# Shanty rebuilt again
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
Students involved with the divest
ment movement built a shanty on the
grass in White Plaza yesterday after
noon, marking the third time such a
structure has been constructed there
this year.
A shantytown built by anti
apartheid demonstrators last quarter
was destroyed by vandals, rebuilt and
then razed by a storm on February
14.
Cam Baker, spokesperson for
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOS A), said that while SOS A sup
ported the shanty being rebuilt, it was
not directly responsible for the
structure.
"It was individual efforts and re
sources that contributed to the shanty
being built," Baker said.
University officials had asked that
students contact them before con
structing another set of shanties. J.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, head of Stu
dent Organizations and Services at
Tresidder Union, said his office had
not been told the shanty was going to
be rebuilt.
"As the shantytown stands now, it
is against health codes for students to
inhabit it," Ramsey-Perez said.
"1 can think of better places for the
shanty to be besides the grass in the
middle of the Plaza where it inter
feres with regular ground work," he
said.
However, Ramsey-Perez stressed
that if students want the shanty to

remain where it is, his otTice would
try to accommodate them. "If that is
where students want it, we'll have to
figure out a way to work it so that
regular ground work can continue."
SOS A member Joel Bellenson sug
gested the reason SOS A was hesitant
to take credit for building the shanty
was that individual members feared
reprisals by the University.
"Members of SOSA are being tar
geted (by the University) because we
express a poitical point of view that is
confrontational with theirs," Bellen
son said.
"The shanty is not only an image of
poverty. It is also a symbol of our
solidarity with their (black people of
South Africa) desire for making a
revolution in their social situation,"
he added.
Baker agreed that the University
administration probably feels threat
ened by the presence of the shanty." 1
think that they don't want to see it
up," he said.
But Baker added that he didn't
think the University would take ac
tions similar to those taken by UC-
Berkeley administrators when stu
dents there built a shantytown last
week. Berkeley police tore down two
shantytowns in violent confrontations
with protesters after the Berkeley fire
marshall had declared the structures a
fire hazard.
