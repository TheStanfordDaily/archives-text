Blessed are those who struggle to survive, oppression
is worse than the grave. Better to die for a noble cause,
then to live life as a slave."

Keith Archuleta, students involved in the "People s Plat
form spread their message to other Stanford students
during a rally in White Plaza yesterday.
I he platform outlines a series of issues that members of
progressive and I hird World student groups feel should
be the pivotal ones for the upcoming ASSU elections.
Yesterday's noon rally "was designed to make students
aware of the People's Platform existence and the things
we stand for," said Lisa Neely, one of the platform's or
ganizers and a member of the Stanford American Indian
Organization. The rally drew a small but supportive crowd
of about 60.
The People's Platform was formulated by a coalition
of "progressive and Third World" students early last
march.
Issues that the platform supports include University di
vestment from companies doing business in South Africa,
the sanctuary movement and expansion of the Western
Culture program to a World Culture program. The plat
form says the current Western Culture program is
"severely deficient and must be fundamentally
restructured to include the vital contributions of women,
blacks. Latinos, Asians and Native Americans."

The platform also encourages increased relations with
and commitment to the East Palo Alto community, espe
cially in the area of education, and increased responsibil
ity for ethnic theme houses.
Bill King, a sophomore majoring in biology and an
ASSU Senate candidate, said, "The People's Platform is
just an agenda we want the ASSU to address. In the past,
elections have been based on personalities and individ
uals. We want this one to address issues."
Neely said, "The original purpose of our getting to
gether (platform organizers) was to have a frank discus
sion about what we felt the just and democratic role this
University should follow. We were acting in response to
what we felt was a general disrespect for our interests."
However, Neely denied that the platform was trying to
force all candidates to take stands on the issues that the
platform raises. "People on the committees involved in
forming the platform decided to run because they care
about the issues, but we are not trying to force those who
don't want to take a position."
During the rally, the platform's organizers endorsed
eight undergraduate senate candidates and two graduate
senate candidates. The platform did not endorse a Council
of Presidents slate.
The People's Platform also attacks ASSU funding
precedures. The document that outlines the platform's of
ficial positions says, "Because of the limited number of
Third World and progressive students on our campus,
their programs and organizations are subject to harsh and
unfair dealings with ASSU fundine."
Blessed are those who struggle to survive, oppression
is worse than the grave. Better to die for a noble cause,
then to live life as a slave."
