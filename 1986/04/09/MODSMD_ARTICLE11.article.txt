Sociology Prof. Seymour Martin
Upset has been chosen one of three
recipients of the Margaret Byrd
Rawson Achievement Award for
outstanding accomplishments by
dyslexic adults.
"The point is to show that people
who have dyslexia can achieve."
Upset said yesterday.
Dyslexia is an impairment of the
ability to read that affects, in
varying degrees, about 15 percent
of American schoolchildren, ac
cording to the National Institutes of
Health. The condition can cause
readers to reverse letters in words,
rendering them difficult to read.
Upset said he did not learn to
read until he reached the third
grade. "It was a painful experience.
I've repressed most of my
memories of that time," Lipset
said.
"You have to learn reading in a
different way, but once you can
read, you can do it as well as
anyone else,"' Lipset said.
"There's a general principle in
teaching," he said. "There are fast

learners and slow learners, but slow
learners can learn the material just
as well. You can go back and learn
it at your own pace.
" Dyslexics are often perceived as
dumb and then they are punished.
The psychological effects of

people's reactions can have the
worst consequences . . . the person
can get an inferiority complex and
feel antagonism towards academic
work," he said.

Dyslexia can also have physical
effects. Lipset said that muscular
coordination can become impaired,
adding that his handwriting is
"abominable." Difficulty in learn
ing foreign languages can also
result from dyslexia, he said.
After learning how to read, l ip
set progressed "like a house on
fire" in New York City's public
schools, gradually moving up from
the lowest to the highest divisions
in his classes.
Lipset attended what he
describes as a "selective public high
school for very bright students."
followed by New York City College
and graduate work in sociology at
Columbia UniveiNity.
Lipset taught at UC-Berkeley
from 1956-65, then he spent 10
years as the Markham Professor of
Government and Sociology at Har
vard University. He has taught at
Stanford since 1975, where he is a
professor both of sociology and po
litical science, and a Hoover fellow.
Lipset plans to travel to Wash
ington. D.C., to receive the award
in May. "I'll give a speech and 1
guess they'll give me a plaque or
something," he said.
