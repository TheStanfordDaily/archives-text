## An Independent Newspaper Boost ASSU grad input 
### 
Currently, the much-maligned ASSU Senate con
sists of 20 voting senators and as many alternates â€”
half of them undergraduates and half graduates. A fair
system to he sure. The proposed new constitution
would, among other changes, increase the voting mem
bership to 30, while eliminating the alternates.
Graduate and undergraduate representation would
remain equal. Or would they?
According to the ASSU Elections Handbook, only
seven graduates are on the ballot for next week's
ASSU election. Four of those have declined to submit
the standard statement plugging themselves to the
handbook. Why should they? After all, just by placing
themselves on the ballot, all have assured themselves a
spot in next years senate. In contrast, 34 undergradu
ates are running for the 10 undergraduate voting posi
tions.
Even more than constitutional changes or by-law

rewriting, the key to improving the functioning of the
senate is electing people who are truly dedicated to
doing a good job. The chances of getting these people
is by necessity reduced when the voters don't have a
choice. One graduate senator wrote in his statement
that he plans on "sitting there, doing (his) homework
and reminding everyone how stupid they are acting."
Certainly it's important for the senate not to take itself
too seriouly, but where do you draw the line?
The fact that most graduate senators "think the sen
ate is a joke" is a legacy of years of mismanagement
and bureaucracy; nevertheless, getting graduate
senators involved in student government is a minumum
prerequisite for long-term improvement in student
government at Stanford. Undergraduates are only half
the story; graduates, too, will have to get involved if
the senate is to become the efficient body that most
students now seem to want it to be.
