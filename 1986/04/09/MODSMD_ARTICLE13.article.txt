## Prejudice oppresses everyone 
### 
I'll say this at the beginning: please don't apply the rules
of logical development to this column. It may not even be
a column; what it seems to me is more a compilation of
thoughts and feelings. It does at least have a theme: rac
ism and prejudice. But it may be different in that it is from
the point of view of a member of the oppressor class, not
the oppressed.
It is from my point of view , a white, rich, heterosexual,
American male. I, who have never felt the barriers of race
which have subjugated my black friends, nor those of sex
which have weakened my female friends, nor the preju-

dice which demeans my homosexual friends. By virtue of
my birth, by my wealth and the color of my skin, I am the
oppressor. So perhaps this column is about white liberal
guil|. But I hope not. Because guilt won't get me very far;
it won't help to change the system. Perhaps it is about
anger, the anger of a white male who despises the patriar
chal and racist society which he, by the nature of his being,
represents. But this too is not the whole issue, just part of
the complexities which bind me.
Perhaps the question is one of self-definition. With
whom do I identify myself, with what groups, with what
ideology? Many of the people around me I see pas
sionately attached to their particular self-definition.
Blacks fight for black causes, women fight for feminism,
homosexuals fight for gay rights. Yet I exist in a form of
limbo. I can fight for few minority causes, because I am
part of the oppressor majority. And if I drop out of that
system, my own system, my "community," I have
seemingly nowhere to go. I am attacked by white males
for abandoning the system, and by others for being a
white male.
The blacks around me are able to unite, and share in
their anger. Or perhaps they are able to share in their
righteousness, able to unite against the obvious evil which
they have endured. But I am not. I am trapped by my
birth. I will never be fully accepted by the minority com
munity, for I am not truly black, nor female, nor
homosexual. As radical as I may be, I can never change
my birth; and what do I do if I despise, in so many ways,
the racist and inhuman acts which put my family on top of
the heap and allowed me, of good name, to go to the best
doctors and the best schools? I think at least the minority
has a true community, one bonded by the travesties which
he or she has endured. Yet I, embarrassed and belittled by
my cultural heritage, have nowhere to stand.
But please, don't interpret this as my romanticizing the
oppressed position. I shall do nothing of the sort. My
point is only that we are all oppressed in an unequal and
prejudiced system, where profits are made inherently
upon the backs of others. Hegel's master-slave paradox is
directly applicable here: the masters are just as caught in
their roles as are the slaves, and equally unhappy. It is not
enough to change the roles, either: we need to change the
whole system. I have often asked how blacks and other
minorities can participate whole-heartedly in the system
we have now, trying to switch places, to get on top of the

future down-trodden. Of course, this is not a fair question,
really, for American blacks, on the whole, have the same
definition of success and happiness as most American
whites: they all want to get their own piece of the cliched
pie. But I still ask it. How can anyone work solely at
placing himself on top of the heap when, by definition,
this means someone else will be on the bottom, holding
the heap up?
Consider the system which has been placed around us.
Education is racist; why don't we study World Culture
and read black and Chicano writers? Furthermore, what
of our professors? Of 1,200 professors at Stanford, only
23 are black; only 11 of those are tenured. We live in a so
ciety which has been built upon the work of slaves, and as
much as we might hope, today it really is no different. But
the scary part is this: many of the oppressed minority are
buying into the oppressive system. The anger of the '60s
has become the careerism and yuppieism of the '80s. By
pretending to listen to the complaints of the oppressed,
the leaders of the society have quelled the furor, and the
dissenters have been assimilated. Today the racism is
more sophisticated; now it takes the form of police
brutality, or the model minority myth. It also takes the
form of minorities accepting the racist and prejudiced
views of the oppressive culture. It is more insidious, and
perhaps thus even more dangerous.

. . . we are all oppressed in
an unequal and prejudiced
system, where profits are
made inherently upon the
backs of others. Hegel's
master-slave paradox is di
rectly applicable here: the
masters are just as caught in
their roles as are the slaves,
and equally unhappy. . . .

But this column began as a personal viewpoint, from
the perspective of a member of the oppressor class who
realizes his blind participation in the system is a form of
active complicity. What am I to do? I, and all members of
the majority, must understand how any prejudice in the
society opresses us just as much, though differently, as it
does the minority. We must work to fight oppression in all
forms, to look "beyond our individual boundaries to see
the humanity which binds us all. We must all strike at the
roots of racism, instilled by an oppressor society to make
money off the backs of the minority. And we must realize,
everyone of us, whether minority or majority, our moral
responsibility to change the system. Otherwise, as Hegel
warns, we are just going to switch positions, and no one
will be any happier.

directly applicable here: the masters are just as caught in
their roles as are the slaves, and equally unhappy. It is not
enough to change the roles, either: we need to change the
whole system. I have often asked how blacks and other
minorities can participate whole-heartedly in the system
we have now, trying to switch places, to get on top of the

future down-trodden. Of course, this is not a fair question,
really, for American blacks, on the whole, have the same
definition of success and happiness as most American
whites: they all want to get their own piece of the cliched
pie. But I still ask it. How can anyone work solely at
placing himself on top of the heap when, by definition,
this means someone else will be on the bottom, holding
the heap up?
Consider the system which has been placed around us.
Education is racist; why don't we study World Culture
and read black and Chicano writers? Furthermore, what
of our professors? Of 1,200 professors at Stanford, only
23 are black; only 11 of those are tenured. We live in a so
ciety which has been built upon the work of slaves, and as
much as we might hope, today it really is no different. But
the scary part is this: many of the oppressed minority are
buying into the oppressive system. The anger of the '60s
has become the careerism and yuppieism of the '80s. By
pretending to listen to the complaints of the oppressed,
the leaders of the society have quelled the furor, and the
dissenters have been assimilated. Today the racism is
more sophisticated; now it takes the form of police
brutality, or the model minority myth. It also takes the
form of minorities accepting the racist and prejudiced
views of the oppressive culture. It is more insidious, and
perhaps thus even more dangerous.

. . . we are all oppressed in
an unequal and prejudiced
system, where profits are
made inherently upon the
backs of others. Hegel's
master-slave paradox is di
rectly applicable here: the
masters are just as caught in
their roles as are the slaves,
and equally unhappy. . . .

But this column began as a personal viewpoint, from
the perspective of a member of the oppressor class who
realizes his blind participation in the system is a form of
active complicity. What am I to do? I, and all members of
the majority, must understand how any prejudice in the
society opresses us just as much, though differently, as it
does the minority. We must work to fight oppression in all
forms, to look "beyond our individual boundaries to see
the humanity which binds us all. We must all strike at the
roots of racism, instilled by an oppressor society to make
money off the backs of the minority. And we must realize,
everyone of us, whether minority or majority, our moral
responsibility to change the system. Otherwise, as Hegel
warns, we are just going to switch positions, and no one
will be any happier.

I'll say this at the beginning: please don't apply the rules
of logical development to this column. It may not even be
a column; what it seems to me is more a compilation of
thoughts and feelings. It does at least have a theme: rac
ism and prejudice. But it may be different in that it is from
the point of view of a member of the oppressor class, not
the oppressed.
It is from my point of view , a white, rich, heterosexual,
American male. I, who have never felt the barriers of race
which have subjugated my black friends, nor those of sex
which have weakened my female friends, nor the preju-

dice which demeans my homosexual friends. By virtue of
my birth, by my wealth and the color of my skin, I am the
oppressor. So perhaps this column is about white liberal
guil|. But I hope not. Because guilt won't get me very far;
it won't help to change the system. Perhaps it is about
anger, the anger of a white male who despises the patriar
chal and racist society which he, by the nature of his being,
represents. But this too is not the whole issue, just part of
the complexities which bind me.
Perhaps the question is one of self-definition. With
whom do I identify myself, with what groups, with what
ideology? Many of the people around me I see pas
sionately attached to their particular self-definition.
Blacks fight for black causes, women fight for feminism,
homosexuals fight for gay rights. Yet I exist in a form of
limbo. I can fight for few minority causes, because I am
part of the oppressor majority. And if I drop out of that
system, my own system, my "community," I have
seemingly nowhere to go. I am attacked by white males
for abandoning the system, and by others for being a
white male.
The blacks around me are able to unite, and share in
their anger. Or perhaps they are able to share in their
righteousness, able to unite against the obvious evil which
they have endured. But I am not. I am trapped by my
birth. I will never be fully accepted by the minority com
munity, for I am not truly black, nor female, nor
homosexual. As radical as I may be, I can never change
my birth; and what do I do if I despise, in so many ways,
the racist and inhuman acts which put my family on top of
the heap and allowed me, of good name, to go to the best
doctors and the best schools? I think at least the minority
has a true community, one bonded by the travesties which
he or she has endured. Yet I, embarrassed and belittled by
my cultural heritage, have nowhere to stand.
But please, don't interpret this as my romanticizing the
oppressed position. I shall do nothing of the sort. My
point is only that we are all oppressed in an unequal and
prejudiced system, where profits are made inherently
upon the backs of others. Hegel's master-slave paradox is
directly applicable here: the masters are just as caught in
their roles as are the slaves, and equally unhappy. It is not
