## Right to die needs federal protection 
### 
In January 1985. 82 percent of the respondents
in a Harris Survey, and 8 1 percent in a Gallup Poll
favored withholding life-support systems from
competent and incompetent patients if that is what
they want, or would want.
Our notions of life, death and medicine have
evolved tremendously in the 10 years since the Su
preme Court of New Jersey grappled with the issue
in the Karen Quintan case. We now realize that we

had let our amazing technology get out of hand. We
were catapulted into an era where it became diffi
cult to determine when a person was actually
"dead."
Confronting the situation of having to discon
tinue life-support for someone who was brain
dead. but who appeared to be alive by virtue of
modern medical science, forced us to examine
whether everyone should be given the "full court
press" in medical treatment. This was no easy task
in that it first required acknowledging our own in
evitable death, a concept much frowned upon in
our culture.
While death indeed appears to have "come out

of the closet," in society generally, it is just begin
ning to open the door in the land of legality. The
courts and legislatures have moved cautiously on
matters of withdrawing or withholding life
sustaining medical treatment. There has been prog
ress. but it varies by state, and is inconsistent and
uneven.
The state of California hits the most recent and
the most rational case law on the subject. With the
California Natural Death Act of 1976. California
became the first state to enact a "living will" or
"advance directive" statute (a document whereby a
person may specify in advance what measures they
wish to have taken in case of life-threatening ill
ness). In 1984. the state again led the way with the
"Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care"
legislation. (This document specifies a person who
may make legally binding decisions regarding
health care, even if its maker becomes incom
petent.) Undoubtedly other states must follow, in
time.
Time is the one thing that most people do not
have when they are face to face with the legal
ramifications of refusing or withdrawing life
sustaining medical treatment. Most often a patient
dies before a court can make a ruling in his particu
lar case.

Thankfully, most of these scenarios do not need
to be resolved in a court of law. but the fact that
any of them should be is a wonderment to those
who believe that the Constitution gives an individ
ual a paramount right to accept or refuse medical
treatment.
State legislation and common law is helpful, but
it only addresses part of the problem. The resulting
uncertainty has paralyzed many health care
providers, who often refuse a patient's request to
discontinue life-support out of fear of civil, or even
criminal, legal action.
It is time for the federal government to stop
watching from the sidelines while the 50 states "do
their own thing" with regard to life and death law.
Sensible, valid and workable solutions have been
offered in the President's Commission for the
Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and
Biomedical and Behavioral Research report
"Deciding to Forego Life-Sustaining Treatment:
Ethical, Medical and Legal Issues in Treatment
Decisions" (1983).
The hard work has been done. All Congress
needs to do now is to do something now .
