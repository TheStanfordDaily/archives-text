## Support Columbae sanctuary 
### 
On Monday, Columbae House declared itself a sanctu
ary for Central American refugees. The Stanford chapter
of the National Lawyer's Guild applauds Columbae's ac
tion, and we hope The Daily, the ASSU and the Univer
sity administration will support Columbae.
The Reagan Administration has taken the position that
providing sanctuary for refugees fleeing political persecu
tion in Central America is wrong, both legally and
morally. However, the legal and ethical issues involved in
the sanctuary movement are not settled, and the current
federal position is at odds with the written law and with
state and municipal government enforcement practices. It
is also contrary to the moral sentiments and political
beliefs of many Americans.

HENRY BEMPORAD

The federal law in question is the 1980 Refugee Act,
which adopts many of the refugee provisions of the
Geneva Convention. It provides asylum for foreigners
being persecuted or fearing persecution in their own
countries. The present enforcement of this act by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) heavily
favors refugees from Marxist and Eastern bloc countries
while uniformly ignoring the pleas of people fleeing vio
lence in U.S. allies El Salvador and Guatemala (29 per
cent of the Polish applicants and 78 percent of the Soviet
applicants for refugee status were granted asylum in 1984,
as opposed to 2.5 percent of the Salvadorans and .6 per
cent of the Guatemalans applying). There are approxi
mately 500,000 Central American refugees currently in
the United States; because the vast majority of them are
barred from legal asylum by the INS policies, they remain
here "illegally." According to the Administration, those
Americans who try to help these refugees by providing
them with food and shelter are also acting illegally.
Many feel that it is the INS enforcement of the Refugee
Act, rather than the sanctuary movement's activities, that
is illegal. The United Nations High Commission for
Refugees has found U.S. treatment of Salvadorans to be
in violation of international and federal laws. Congress
men like Ed Zschau have responded to the INS by draft
ing new legislation that would protect Salvadoran
refugees. Many local administrative groups, such as hospi
tals and city councils, have refused to cooperate with the
INS by not identifying refugees. Others, including the
state of New Mexico, have declared their general opposi
tion to the federal deportations of Central Americans
back to face imprisonment, torture and even death in their
home countries. There are no previous federal court cases
dealing with sanctuary; the first such case is now being
tried in Arizona.
All this goes to show just how unsettled the law is in the
area of sanctuary. But the moral position of the Reagan
Administration is even more perplexing. It is hard to see

the moral justification for returning refugees to the vio
lence and terror of guerrilla war and death squads in their
homelands. The current argument is that these refugees
are here for economic reasons rather than political ones
and that they come to America to take away our jobs
rather than to ask for protection. However, this does little
to explain the 80,000 people who have been killed in El
Salvador and Guatemala since 1979. These deaths and
the fears they create are the reasons that Central
Americans are fleeing to the United States, and they ac
count for the widespread, non-partisan support refugees
are receiving from church and humanitarian groups across
the country.
In light of the dissension and controversy surrounding
the sanctuary movement, Columbae's actions are both
morally and legally appropriate. When a government en
forces its political or social policies in violation of its own
laws and international treaties, it is the duty of American
citizens to stand up for the law and oppose the
governmental policies. This is exactly what was done
during the civil rights movement of the 19605, and it is ex
actly what Columbae House is doing now.
Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding sanctuary,
Stanford's decision whether or not lo support Columbae{
and the campus sanctuary movement is primarily a politi- J
cal and moral decision. The Stanford administration is in*
no position to decide the legal questions involved;!
however, it can make a significant impact by joining the*
more than 20 colleges nationwide that have declared at.
least part of their campuses to be sanctuary for CentralJ
American refugees. Because the government has only*
prosecuted for long-term harboring or transportation of!
aliens, Stanford can take such a position without fear of'
legal action. In doing so, the University would have*
respected the views of the residents of Columbae and the!
Stanford student body as represented by the ASSU, which*
declared its support of making Stanford a sanctuary ear-!
lier this year. !
Students will get a chance to vote directly on the issue •'
of sanctuary in a referendum during the ASSU elections!
April 15 and 16. We hope that the student body will fol-;
low the leadership of the ASSU and Columbae in voicing!
its support for the sanctuary movement on campus, and!
we ask that the University administration be open to the;
possibility of Stanford declaring itself a haven for'
refugees, at least symbolically. If the University officially!
joins the federal government in opposing sanctuary, it will;
be adopting a moral and political position that denies*
Stanford students the right to self-government and that!
adds to the suffering of the hundreds of thousands of;
Central American refugees now living in fear of deporta-'
tion in this country. Such an action cannot be disguised as!
mere "obedience of the law." •

On Monday, Columbae House declared itself a sanctu
ary for Central American refugees. The Stanford chapter
of the National Lawyer's Guild applauds Columbae's ac
tion, and we hope The Daily, the ASSU and the Univer
sity administration will support Columbae.
The Reagan Administration has taken the position that
providing sanctuary for refugees fleeing political persecu
tion in Central America is wrong, both legally and
morally. However, the legal and ethical issues involved in
the sanctuary movement are not settled, and the current
federal position is at odds with the written law and with
state and municipal government enforcement practices. It
is also contrary to the moral sentiments and political
beliefs of many Americans.

The federal law in question is the 1980 Refugee Act,
which adopts many of the refugee provisions of the
Geneva Convention. It provides asylum for foreigners
being persecuted or fearing persecution in their own
countries. The present enforcement of this act by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) heavily
favors refugees from Marxist and Eastern bloc countries
while uniformly ignoring the pleas of people fleeing vio
lence in U.S. allies El Salvador and Guatemala (29 per
cent of the Polish applicants and 78 percent of the Soviet
applicants for refugee status were granted asylum in 1984,
as opposed to 2.5 percent of the Salvadorans and .6 per
cent of the Guatemalans applying). There are approxi
mately 500,000 Central American refugees currently in
the United States; because the vast majority of them are
barred from legal asylum by the INS policies, they remain
here "illegally." According to the Administration, those
Americans who try to help these refugees by providing
them with food and shelter are also acting illegally.
Many feel that it is the INS enforcement of the Refugee
Act, rather than the sanctuary movement's activities, that
is illegal. The United Nations High Commission for
Refugees has found U.S. treatment of Salvadorans to be
in violation of international and federal laws. Congress
men like Ed Zschau have responded to the INS by draft
ing new legislation that would protect Salvadoran
refugees. Many local administrative groups, such as hospi
tals and city councils, have refused to cooperate with the
INS by not identifying refugees. Others, including the
state of New Mexico, have declared their general opposi
tion to the federal deportations of Central Americans
back to face imprisonment, torture and even death in their
home countries. There are no previous federal court cases
dealing with sanctuary; the first such case is now being
tried in Arizona.
All this goes to show just how unsettled the law is in the
area of sanctuary. But the moral position of the Reagan
Administration is even more perplexing. It is hard to see

the moral justification for returning refugees to the vio
lence and terror of guerrilla war and death squads in their
homelands. The current argument is that these refugees
are here for economic reasons rather than political ones
and that they come to America to take away our jobs
rather than to ask for protection. However, this does little
to explain the 80,000 people who have been killed in El
Salvador and Guatemala since 1979. These deaths and
the fears they create are the reasons that Central
Americans are fleeing to the United States, and they ac
count for the widespread, non-partisan support refugees
are receiving from church and humanitarian groups across
the country.
In light of the dissension and controversy surrounding
the sanctuary movement, Columbae's actions are both
morally and legally appropriate. When a government en
forces its political or social policies in violation of its own
laws and international treaties, it is the duty of American
citizens to stand up for the law and oppose the
governmental policies. This is exactly what was done
during the civil rights movement of the 19605, and it is ex
actly what Columbae House is doing now.
Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding sanctuary,
Stanford's decision whether or not lo support Columbae{
and the campus sanctuary movement is primarily a politi- J
cal and moral decision. The Stanford administration is in*
no position to decide the legal questions involved;!
however, it can make a significant impact by joining the*
more than 20 colleges nationwide that have declared at.
least part of their campuses to be sanctuary for CentralJ
American refugees. Because the government has only*
prosecuted for long-term harboring or transportation of!
aliens, Stanford can take such a position without fear of'
legal action. In doing so, the University would have*
respected the views of the residents of Columbae and the!
Stanford student body as represented by the ASSU, which*
declared its support of making Stanford a sanctuary ear-!
lier this year. !
Students will get a chance to vote directly on the issue •'
of sanctuary in a referendum during the ASSU elections!
April 15 and 16. We hope that the student body will fol-;
low the leadership of the ASSU and Columbae in voicing!
its support for the sanctuary movement on campus, and!
we ask that the University administration be open to the;
possibility of Stanford declaring itself a haven for'
refugees, at least symbolically. If the University officially!
joins the federal government in opposing sanctuary, it will;
be adopting a moral and political position that denies*
Stanford students the right to self-government and that!
adds to the suffering of the hundreds of thousands of;
Central American refugees now living in fear of deporta-'
tion in this country. Such an action cannot be disguised as!
mere "obedience of the law." •
