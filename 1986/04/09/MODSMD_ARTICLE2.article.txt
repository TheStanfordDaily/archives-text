# Report on divestment handed to ASSU
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
An ASSU Senate subcommittee last
night issued a report on the costs and
ramifications of ASSU divestment from
the University's investment pool, which in
cludes stocks in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
The senate will discuss and possibly vote
on divestment of ASSU funds at the next
senate meeting April 22. The proposal
must receive a two-thirds vote to pass.
Problems with divestment identified in
the report, completed by the ASSU Sub
committee of the Budget and Finance
Committee, include the costs to the ASSU
of divesting, shortcomings of the South
Africa-free alternative funds, legal
ramifications and the suspect ability of the
ASSU to manage its own portfolio.
Currently, the ASSU has approximately
$625,000 invested in the University's
"Merged Pool 'B,' " and approximately
$700,000 invested in the University's

"Expendable Funds Pool," a money mar
ket fund that holds student organizations'
money.
The subeommittee found two mutual
equity funds offering a South Africa-free
policy: Ihe Calvert Social Responsibility
Fund and the Prospector Fund, indepen
dent mutual equity funds. Each has been
started in the last four years, "and it is
therefore difficult to truly measure their
performance," the subcommittee said.
According to the report, because "the
fund is both new and small, we would have
to manage any investment in it carefully,
watching the fund on a continual basis."
Measuring the "long-term interest
returned" by the proposed fund as
opposed to the pool in which the ASSU is
currently invested, the subcommittee
reports "a loss of $6,250 per year" result
ing from the proposed transfer of money.
If the $700,000 currently in the Expen
dable Funds Pool were transferred into a
money-market account, the ASSU "would

lose 3 percent a year or approximately
$21,000 a year if we were to transfer to the
funds," the report says.
Additionally, the report states that in
vesting in other money market funds that,
unlike the University, do not guarantee to
return full value of the principal invest
ment "would risk money that is almost ex
clusively that of student groups."
Because the senate "is required by law
to manage its trust and endowment funds
in a fiscally resonsible manner," according
to the report, divestment "may he under
taken only if it fits within that 'fiscally re
sponsible' standard."
The report also notes the possibility of
government or private legal action against
ASSU divestment, but said that "the
chances of a court intervening are mini
mal."
Finally, the report considers the "issues
besides South Africa we should consider
when rating the social responsibility or
morality of an investment." Citing other
repressive regimes besides that in South

Africa, immoral business activities and in
compassionate business conduct with
which many companies are associated, the
report asked if the ASSU should "divest
from certain types of immoral or irrespon
sible investments," or from all types.
The subcommittee's report ended by
stating: "There is a real question as to
whether divestment is the most effective
means to ending apartheid."
In its preliminary summary of the issue,
the subcommittee recalls the referendum
passed by the student body in January
1986 calling on the ASSU not to "remain
invested, either directly or indirectly, in
companies doing business in South
Africa."
As a result of January's referendum, the
Divestment Subcommittee "was charged
with examining the financial consequences
of divesting the ASSU's funds from Stan
ford University funds and reinvesting these
funds in a South Africa free portfolio," ac
cording to the report.
