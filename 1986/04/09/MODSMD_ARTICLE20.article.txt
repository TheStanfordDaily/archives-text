## Radar reveals the hidden faces of Jupiter's moons 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
Like winking eyes, three of the
planet Jupiter's largest moons circle
the giant planet slowly, majestically,
glistening under the light of the dis
tant sun. These moons, pockmarked
- and scarred as they are, are sheathed
* in coats of ancient ice which produce
-"bizarre" echoes when radio waves
are beamed at them from the earth. A
Stanford engineer has developed a
theory which presents a new model of
the moons' structure to account for
the strange responses.
According to Von Eshleman, pro
fessor of electrical engineering at the
Center for Radar Astronomy here,
the layers of ice and buried craters
beneath them may be responsible for
the bizarre echoes.
Over the past decade, scientists
have tried but failed to explain the
ability of icy moons to splinter the en
ergy of radar echoes into patterns
completely different from echoes re
corded from rocky moons and
planets.
In a Feb. 27 article in Nature mag
azine, Eshleman wrote that earlier
theories have been unable to explain

the patterns or the "astounding
strengths'" of radar echoes from the
moons Europa, Ganymede and Cal
listo.
Eshleman's calculations suggest
that icy moons could bounce radio
energy back to Earth by a process
akin to the optical phenomenon
called "the glory."
Airplane passengers see the glory
as a bright halo around the shadow a
plane casts as it flies over a flat bank
of clouds. Sunshine striking the
clouds "bounces around inside the
spherical water droplets" and is mag
nified, (thus producing the halo),
Eshleman explained.
Ice on Jupiter's moons, he said,
may bend radar beams the way the
water droplets in clouds capture the
sun's rays. Craters buried under the
icy surface of the moons could act like
the droplets and focus and magnify
energy.
The largest four moons of Jupiter,
first discovered by Galileo, can be
easily seen by anyone with a good
pair of binoculars. Even so, it took
the spacecraft Voyager's precise in
struments to discover that the inner
most Galilean moon, 10, is covered
with volcanic sulfur, while the outer

three are clad in ice.
Radar astronomy can be used to
probe the subsurface structure of the
icy moons, Eshleman said.
Astronomers beam radio energy to
objects in space, and the portion of
the waves that reflect back to Earth

provide information on the materials
and the roughness of celestial
surfaces. This returning energy is
weak but gives a "clear signal" for
precise measurements, Eshleman ex
plained.
Ice normally reflects less radio en

ergy than rock, he added, so scientists
expected Jupiter's icy moons to be
dimmer than our moon would be at a
similar distance.
Radar measurements made over
the past 10 years, however, have
shown that Jupiter's satellites are up
to 25 times brighter than was
predicted.
Somehow the icy moons can con
centrate and focus radar waves so
that more than the predicted* signal
echoes back to Earth.
Eshleman explained that buried
craters would help account for this.
The ice within the craters "acts like
glass in a road reflector" he said, and
the radio waves that reflect from the
ice would be channeled by the walls
of the craters back in the direction of
the Earth. Without the craters, many
of the waves would scatter.
Even craters with surfaces curving
partially away from the Earth would
reflect some radio energy, Eshleman
added. Waves striking the ice cover
ing the craters at an angle would be
bent or refracted down into the
craters in the same way that light
striking the surface of a still pool at an
angle is bent down. Radio waves
reflecting up from the bottom of the

craters would then be bent back
toward the Earth, producing a
brighter radio "image" of the moon
than would result if there were no ice
to do the refracting.
If Eshleman's model is correct, the
radar readings from Europa,
Ganymede and Callisto can reveal
some of the complex history of the
outer solar system. His scenario in
volves repeated collisions of meteors
with the moons, over millions of
years, cratering the surface and
sometimes even punching through
the icy crust to release a flood of
melted ice.
This water then solidifies into ice
that is denser than underlying layers.
Over time, some of the new ice sub
limates — turns directly to vapor —
leaving a lighter, spongy layer to be
cratered and flooded in another
round of the cycle.
Further testing of the theory using
advanced future spacecraft could in
volve precise radio measurements of
objects such as the icy moons of
Saturn and Uranus. The resulting
data could go a long way toward
proving Eshleman's theory and shed
ding more light on the makeup of
these "unworldly worlds of ice."
