## Mistakes costly as Cardinal falls to Broncos

victory and defeat can be a slim one.
at Sunken Diamond, a throw
from shortstop to first that was a few inches
too low paved the way for two unearned
Clara runs in the sixth inning, icing the
Broncos 5-4 non-conference victory over the
No. 7 Stanford baseball team.
;The loss was the Cardinal's fourth in its last
five games and second consecutive non
cconference defeat. Although Stanford
remains tied with UCLA for first place in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division, the loss lowered
thje team's overall record to 22-13. Given the
tight standings in the Pac-10 this season, that
overall record will likely have a significant
bejaring on Stanford's postseason placement.
After a rough four-day weekend that saw
them drop two of three to UCLA, the Card
inal might have been hoping for a breather
yesterday. It looked as though things might
work out that way, as the team got out to a
quick start in the first.

Quicksilver leftfielder Walt Harris led off
with an infield single, stole second, scampered
to third on Ruben Amaro's shallow fly to cen
ter, and then came home on a sacrifice fly by
Mark Davis to stake the Cardinal to a 1-0
lead.
The Broncos quickly evened the score in
the second. First baseman Joe Gosland
opened the inning with a stand-up double into
the hole in left-center, and moved to third on
Steve Clinton's single up the middle. The
Cardinal stranded Clinton between first and
second trying to steal, and in the ensuing
excitement Gosland came home with the
tying run.
Stanford could muster little offense again
until the sixth. Bronco starter Matt McCor
mick (who brought an 0-3 record and 8.04
ERA to the game) mixed his pitches well and
was backed by some defensive gems, while
the Cardinal squandered several golden
scoring opportunities.
One such opportunity came in the third.
Harris walked to begin the frame, and Amaro
followed with a perfect hit-and-run single into
right field. Harris slowed a bit rounding

second and was greeted at third by the ball
and third baseman Steve Koontz. Koontz
tagged out Harris and quickly threw to second
to nail Amaro trying to stretch his single into
a double. Instead of first and second with no
outs, the Cardinal suddenly had two out and
none on.
The Broncos were not so wasteful with
their scoring chances. Cardinal starter Steve
Chitren began the inning in a generous mood,
walking the first two Santa Clara batters.
Both of those runners came around to score
on a sacrifice bunt, a groundout to the left
side and a single by catcher Chris McCall.
After 3Vi innings, the Broncos led 3-1.
McCormick began to tire in the fourth, and
the Cardinal again threatened. Right fielder
Toi Cook and first baseman Doug Robbins
stroked carbon copy flies to deep left-center.
Twice, however. Bronco centeiifielder Todd
Gates went far to his rig! t to make running
catches, and the inning ended without inci
dent.
Stanford mounted another threat in the
bottom of the fifth, loading the bases on two
singles and a walk. Again the rally died with

out a score.
The sixth was the pivotal inning for the
Cardinal. Reliever Ugo Colella got two quick
outs, and with two men on he induced Koontz
to ground to shortstop Frank Carey for what
looked to be the inning-ending out. Carey's
peg to first was low, though, Koontz was safe,
and the bases were loaded. Bronco second
baseman Steve Dißono then rapped a single
to left, driving in two runs and putting the
Broncos ahead for good, 5-1.
The Cardinal bats came to life momentarily
in the Stanford half of the sixth. Davis singled,
Robbins walked and designated hitter Ed
Sprague knocked them both in with a well
placed triple to the right-center gap. When
second baseman Dißono muffed Ken Green's
bouncer, Sprague came home to make the
score 5-4 with only one out.
Santa Clara countered by bringing in the
ace of its staff, Wes Bliven, and the powerful
righthander closed shop on the Cardinal of
fense, allowing only one hit the rest of the
way.
"I felt pretty good today," Bliven said.
"The adrenaline was way up, and my control

was pretty good. When you have both of
those things, you usually do pretty well."
Bliven earned a save, his first of the season,
and McCormick collected his first victory of
the season against three losses. For Stanford,
Chitren absorbed the loss to move his record
to 2-4 on the year.
Bliven had no problems explaining the
Bronco victory.
"The defense was really the key," he said.
"We made some great defensive plays today,
especially the one to turn a single into a
double play."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess was
noticeably frustrated with his team's play, but
gainsaid any notions that the team is tired or
slumping.
"We just didn't hit the ball very well,"
Marquess said. "We had a critical error and a
base-running mistake.
"We're playing much better defense, but
we haven't pitched as well (as earlier in the
season). . . we've had a problem all year
scoring runs. We just can't generate enough
offense."




A. pivotal play in yesterday's Stanford-Santa Clara game occurred in the bottom of the third inning. After
drawing a leadoff walk, Walt Harris tried to go to third on a hit-and-run single by Kuben Amaro. He slowed
down coming around second, however, and was tagged out by third baseman Steve Koontz, who got up and

Mike Topolovac/Daily
cut down Amaro attempting to advance to second. The strange double-play was one of the miscues that led to
the 5-4 Stanford loss, which put the Cardinal's season record at 22-13. Stanford will have to avoid such
mistakes if it is to beat rival California this weekend.

followed with a perfect hit-and-run single into
right field. Harris slowed a bit rounding

second and was greeted at third by the ball
and third baseman Steve Koontz. Koontz
tagged out Harris and quickly threw to second
to nail Amaro trying to stretch his single into
a double. Instead of first and second with no
outs, the Cardinal suddenly had two out and
none on.
The Broncos were not so wasteful with
their scoring chances. Cardinal starter Steve
Chitren began the inning in a generous mood,
walking the first two Santa Clara batters.
Both of those runners came around to score
on a sacrifice bunt, a groundout to the left
side and a single by catcher Chris McCall.
After 3Vi innings, the Broncos led 3-1.
McCormick began to tire in the fourth, and
the Cardinal again threatened. Right fielder
Toi Cook and first baseman Doug Robbins
stroked carbon copy flies to deep left-center.
Twice, however. Bronco centeiifielder Todd
Gates went far to his rig! t to make running
catches, and the inning ended without inci
dent.
Stanford mounted another threat in the
bottom of the fifth, loading the bases on two
singles and a walk. Again the rally died with

out a score.
The sixth was the pivotal inning for the
Cardinal. Reliever Ugo Colella got two quick
outs, and with two men on he induced Koontz
to ground to shortstop Frank Carey for what
looked to be the inning-ending out. Carey's
peg to first was low, though, Koontz was safe,
and the bases were loaded. Bronco second
baseman Steve Dißono then rapped a single
to left, driving in two runs and putting the
Broncos ahead for good, 5-1.
The Cardinal bats came to life momentarily
in the Stanford half of the sixth. Davis singled,
Robbins walked and designated hitter Ed
Sprague knocked them both in with a well
placed triple to the right-center gap. When
second baseman Dißono muffed Ken Green's
bouncer, Sprague came home to make the
score 5-4 with only one out.
Santa Clara countered by bringing in the
ace of its staff, Wes Bliven, and the powerful
righthander closed shop on the Cardinal of
fense, allowing only one hit the rest of the
way.
"I felt pretty good today," Bliven said.
"The adrenaline was way up, and my control

was pretty good. When you have both of
those things, you usually do pretty well."
Bliven earned a save, his first of the season,
and McCormick collected his first victory of
the season against three losses. For Stanford,
Chitren absorbed the loss to move his record
to 2-4 on the year.
Bliven had no problems explaining the
Bronco victory.
"The defense was really the key," he said.
"We made some great defensive plays today,
especially the one to turn a single into a
double play."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess was
noticeably frustrated with his team's play, but
gainsaid any notions that the team is tired or
slumping.
"We just didn't hit the ball very well,"
Marquess said. "We had a critical error and a
base-running mistake.
"We're playing much better defense, but
we haven't pitched as well (as earlier in the
season). . . we've had a problem all year
scoring runs. We just can't generate enough
offense."




A. pivotal play in yesterday's Stanford-Santa Clara game occurred in the bottom of the third inning. After
drawing a leadoff walk, Walt Harris tried to go to third on a hit-and-run single by Kuben Amaro. He slowed
down coming around second, however, and was tagged out by third baseman Steve Koontz, who got up and

cut down Amaro attempting to advance to second. The strange double-play was one of the miscues that led to
the 5-4 Stanford loss, which put the Cardinal's season record at 22-13. Stanford will have to avoid such
mistakes if it is to beat rival California this weekend.

at Sunken Diamond, a throw
from shortstop to first that was a few inches
too low paved the way for two unearned
Clara runs in the sixth inning, icing the
Broncos 5-4 non-conference victory over the
No. 7 Stanford baseball team.
;The loss was the Cardinal's fourth in its last
five games and second consecutive non
cconference defeat. Although Stanford
remains tied with UCLA for first place in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division, the loss lowered
thje team's overall record to 22-13. Given the
tight standings in the Pac-10 this season, that
overall record will likely have a significant
bejaring on Stanford's postseason placement.
After a rough four-day weekend that saw
them drop two of three to UCLA, the Card
inal might have been hoping for a breather
yesterday. It looked as though things might
work out that way, as the team got out to a
quick start in the first.

Quicksilver leftfielder Walt Harris led off
with an infield single, stole second, scampered
to third on Ruben Amaro's shallow fly to cen
ter, and then came home on a sacrifice fly by
Mark Davis to stake the Cardinal to a 1-0
lead.
The Broncos quickly evened the score in
the second. First baseman Joe Gosland
opened the inning with a stand-up double into
the hole in left-center, and moved to third on
Steve Clinton's single up the middle. The
Cardinal stranded Clinton between first and
second trying to steal, and in the ensuing
excitement Gosland came home with the
tying run.
Stanford could muster little offense again
until the sixth. Bronco starter Matt McCor
mick (who brought an 0-3 record and 8.04
ERA to the game) mixed his pitches well and
was backed by some defensive gems, while
the Cardinal squandered several golden
scoring opportunities.
