# Stanford netters top Cal
## Werdel and Hagey key women's 7-2 road triumph 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
The California women's tennis
program may be on the rise, hut it
hasn't yet reached the lofty altitudes
occupied by such national power
houses as Stanford, USC and
UCLA.
The Bears' absence at the summit
was evident in yesterday's 7-2 loss
to the Cardinal in Berkeley. Cal
played wel! and, as opposed to pre
vious years, showed that it did in
fact belong on the court with Stan
ford. But the Cardinal's superior
depth was the difference and upped
Stanford's record to 12-1 on the
year. The Bears fell to 14-4.
"Their program has improved
each of the last five or six years,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "They're definitely a real
tough team."
The teams split the first four
singles matches. In the No. 1 match,
Cal's Heather Ettus rebounded
from a 6-0 loss in the first set to up
set Patty Fendick 0-6, 6-4, 6-4.
Down 5-1 in the third set, Fendick
rallied to close within one but could
get no closer.
The Bears' other win came at No.
5 singles, with Sharon Fletcher
handling Stanford's Kay Tittle with
surprising ease 6-0, 6-1. "Kay Tittle
just never got a wake-up call this
morning," Brennan said.
Stanford's early wins came at No.
3 and No. 4 singles. In a Jekyll-and-
Hyde match. Leigh Anne Eldredge
defeated Jennifer Prah 6-0. 0-6. 6-
2. "Although Eldredge is winning
consistently, she always seems to
have one bad set. But she is win
ning."
At No. 4. Stephanie Savides took
care of Linda Oechle in less exciting
fashion, cruising to a 6-1. 6-2 vic
tory.
With the score tied and the final
two singles matches in tight third
sets, the match was still very much
in question. But clutch perfor
mances by freshmen Marianne
Werdel and sophomore Cari Hagey
put the Cardinal in control of the
match.
In the No. 2 match. Werdel
overcame a disappointing loss in a
first-set tiebreaker to beat Cal's
Karin Shin, posting a 6-7. 6-4. 7-6
win.
Hagey also made an impressive
comeback, ripping off five con

Patrick McEnroe's hand may become locked in a permanent victory
clench if he continues to play the way he has this year. Yesterday's 6-
3, 6-4 victory over California's Chris Schoop was his 13th singles win
of the season without a loss.

Stephanie Savides turned in perhaps the strongest performance of
any Stanford player in yesterday's 7-2 win over California, heating

secutive games in the third set to
defeat Mary Margaret Torres 6-2, 2-
6, 6-4. "Cari Hagey's match was an
instrumental match, a critical match,"
Brennan said.
"Hagey and Werdel put us ahead
4-2. Before that, it could have gone
either way," Brennan added. "I'd
much rather go into the doubles up 4-
2 than at 3-3."
The doubles matches lacked both
the length and the excitement of the
singles, as Stanford quickly swept all
three without losing a set. "It was our
best overall doubles performance of

the year," Brennan said. "Everybody
was relaxed. They were hitting away
and were playing very good doubles."
Fendick and Eldredge won nine
straight games from Ettus and Torres
at No. 1 doubles before the Cal duo
retired at 6-0, 3-0.
In the No. 2 match, Hagey and
Savides knocked off Shin and Prah by
a 7-5, 6-1 count. And in the final
doubles match, Tittle woke up in time
to team with Werdel to post an easy
6-3, 6-2 win over Oechle and Carolyn
Yao.
Stanford's next match will be to
morrow, when the No. 2 Cardinal
hosts the UC-Irvine Anteaters at
1:30 p.m.
