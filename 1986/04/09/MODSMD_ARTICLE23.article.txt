# Men sweep singles to clinch 8-1 victory
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
All right folks, it's time '"or a
quote that's something like one of
those hetween-the-legs shots by
Yannick Noah:
"The real Cardinal is starting to
rise out of the nest," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said after yester
day's match against California.
Well, like Yannick's efforts, it
looks good but it just doesn't work.
That's what happens when your
mascot is a color.
In any case, Stanford pounced on
an undermanned Cal squad by
sweeping all six singles matches and
clinching the contest faster than
Noah can braid his hair.
The Cardinal then took two out
of the three doubles matches to post
an 8-1 victory and raise its record to
10-3 overall and 4-1 in the Pacific
10 Conference. The Bears, mean
while, dropped to 13-6, 2-3 in
league play.
"I thought we did a helluva job
today," Gould said. "There's some
kind of mystique from other teams
about Stanford playing well at the
end of the year, and I'd like to keep
that going."
Actually, the match was charac
terized more by what didn't happen
than what did. California's Steve
DeVries, the No. 6-ranked player in
the nation, did not play due to a
sprained wrist he suffered on Mon
day.
Thus, the expected match-up be
tween Stanford's No. 2-ranked Dan
Goldie and DeVries never
materialized. A doubles match pit
ting the Cardinal pair of Goldie and
Jim Grabb versus DeVries and
Chris Schoop could have been a
good one. but it didn't happen
either. Finally, the 13th-ranked
Bears figured to challenge the No. 6
Cardinal, but they didn't.
The Stanford players made sure
of that by forgetting that DeVries
wits out and getting down to busi
ness.
Goldie began the business day by
diposing of Cal's Peter Wright in
well under an hour. The Cardinal
senior raised his record to 6-5 with a
6-1. 6-1 victory.
In the No. 2 singles. Grabb had
trouble with his feet and with Cal's
Harold Hecht early on. but finished
strong to post a 6-4. 4-6. 6-2 win.
"I wasn't moving my feet very well
in the second set," Grabb said.
"Coach (Gould) made the observa
tion and voiced it to me, so I moved a
lot better in the last set."
Hecht, who would have instead
played Stanford's Patrick McEnroe if
DeVries had played, had this to say
on DeVries' abscence: "It was dis
rupting. We thought we would match
up pretty well with Steve in the
lineup, but then we found out an hour
before the match that he couldn't
play," he said. "That got us off to a
slow start, and you can't do that
against Stanford."
Of course playing McEnroe
wouldn't have been much easier. The
Cardinal sophomore coasted by
Schoop 6-3, 6-4 to bring his season

record to 13-0. Now that McEnroe
has gotten through that unlucky 13th
match, who knows when his streak
will end?
"Hopefully it won't end,"
McEnroe said after the match. "I'll
probably lose one sometime, but I
don't think today was a tough
match."
In the No. 4 singles match, Stan
ford's Eric Rosenfeld pounded on the
frustrated freshman Alex Nizet to
record a 6-3, 6-4 victory. With Nizet
continually scolding himself and
Rosenfeld emitting his usual grunts
on every shot, court four was a
veritable cornucopia of cacophony.
Cardinal junior Scott Moody
clinched the match for the Stanford
team in the No. 6 singles by defeating
the Bears' Brian Flowers 7-6, 6-3.
Junior John Letts finished the
singles sweep for Stanford by defeat
ing freshman Woody Hunt 6-4, 6-2.

tion and voiced it to me, so I moved a
lot better in the last set."
Hecht, who would have instead
played Stanford's Patrick McEnroe if
DeVries had played, had this to say
on DeVries' abscence: "It was dis
rupting. We thought we would match
up pretty well with Steve in the
lineup, but then we found out an hour
before the match that he couldn't
play," he said. "That got us off to a
slow start, and you can't do that
against Stanford."
Of course playing McEnroe
wouldn't have been much easier. The
Cardinal sophomore coasted by
Schoop 6-3, 6-4 to bring his season

record to 13-0. Now that McEnroe
has gotten through that unlucky 13th
match, who knows when his streak
will end?
"Hopefully it won't end,"
McEnroe said after the match. "I'll
probably lose one sometime, but I
don't think today was a tough
match."
In the No. 4 singles match, Stan
ford's Eric Rosenfeld pounded on the
frustrated freshman Alex Nizet to
record a 6-3, 6-4 victory. With Nizet
continually scolding himself and
Rosenfeld emitting his usual grunts
on every shot, court four was a
veritable cornucopia of cacophony.
Cardinal junior Scott Moody
clinched the match for the Stanford
team in the No. 6 singles by defeating
the Bears' Brian Flowers 7-6, 6-3.
Junior John Letts finished the
singles sweep for Stanford by defeat
ing freshman Woody Hunt 6-4, 6-2.
