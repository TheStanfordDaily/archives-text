# Spikers look for revenge tonight against Bruins

The last time the Stanford men's
volleyball team faced UCLA, Chris
Braun totalled an amazing 49 kills, a
Stanford record, and a .513 hitting
percentage. The Cardinal still lost in
five games 17-19, 15-5, 15-10,8-15,
12-15.
And this time around, Stanford will
not be playing in the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion. Instead, the
Cardinal must meet the Bruins in
dreaded Pauley Pavilion for the final
match of a six-day, four-game south
ern road trip.
Stanford, 10-6 in the California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association,
has dropped to eighth nationally in
the latest rankings. The Cardinal is
fifth in the CIV A and must finish in
that spot or above to go on to
regional play. UCLA is third in the
country and, at 10-5, fourth in the
conference.
The Stanford squad has won two of
three games already on this trip,
losing only to undefeated and top
ranked USC. The UCLA match is not
as important as it might have been, as
Stanford is guaranteed at least a split
in the southern series.

"It's not of the utmost impor
tance," Stanford Co-coach Don
Shaw said,"but it would definitely
help our cause. We've never beaten
UCLA and it would increase our
chances of making the playoffs. It still
boils down to UC-Santa Barbara at
home on Saturday. That's our whole
season in a nutshell. It's always nice
to beat UCLA, though."
"You want to have momentum
going into the playoffs, that's impor
tant for both teams, but the game it
self is not crucial for either team,"
UCLA Coach Al Scates agreed.
The Stanford players feel some
what differently, however. "We want
to break the Bruin myth, that they're
godly," said junior Stephen Blue,
who leads the squad in hitting
percentage with a .352 average."The
crowd will be big, but it will be big for
us, too. Pauley's so big that it's not
really an advantage for UCLA. We'll
do well."
"We're pretty confident we can
beat them," freshman outside hitter
Dave Johnson said."We had a few
unlucky plays when we lost at Stan
ford, but they're certainly beatable."
