# Spikers look for revenge tonight against Bruins
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
The last time the Stanford men's
volleyball team faced UCLA, Chris
Braun totalled an amazing 49 kills, a
Stanford record, and a .513 hitting
percentage. The Cardinal still lost in
five games 17-19, 15-5, 15-10,8-15,
12-15.
And this time around, Stanford will
not be playing in the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion. Instead, the
Cardinal must meet the Bruins in
dreaded Pauley Pavilion for the final
match of a six-day, four-game south
ern road trip.
Stanford, 10-6 in the California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association,
has dropped to eighth nationally in
the latest rankings. The Cardinal is
fifth in the CIV A and must finish in
that spot or above to go on to
regional play. UCLA is third in the
country and, at 10-5, fourth in the
conference.
The Stanford squad has won two of
three games already on this trip,
losing only to undefeated and top
ranked USC. The UCLA match is not
as important as it might have been, as
Stanford is guaranteed at least a split
in the southern series.

"It's not of the utmost impor
tance," Stanford Co-coach Don
Shaw said,"but it would definitely
help our cause. We've never beaten
UCLA and it would increase our
chances of making the playoffs. It still
boils down to UC-Santa Barbara at
home on Saturday. That's our whole
season in a nutshell. It's always nice
to beat UCLA, though."
"You want to have momentum
going into the playoffs, that's impor
tant for both teams, but the game it
self is not crucial for either team,"
UCLA Coach Al Scates agreed.
The Stanford players feel some
what differently, however. "We want
to break the Bruin myth, that they're
godly," said junior Stephen Blue,
who leads the squad in hitting
percentage with a .352 average."The
crowd will be big, but it will be big for
us, too. Pauley's so big that it's not
really an advantage for UCLA. We'll
do well."
"We're pretty confident we can
beat them," freshman outside hitter
Dave Johnson said."We had a few
unlucky plays when we lost at Stan
ford, but they're certainly beatable."
Braun, a senior All-American can
didate and the team leader in kills
with 324, was more cautious in his
assessment. "They're a tough team,"
he said. "We'll have to play really
tough. It'll be a good game; it could
go either way."
"UCLA is important," outside hit
ter Jon Root said. "We have to win
two of three at home to make the
regionals if we split on the road." The
senior All-American will look to
recover from recurring ankle injuries
and shoulder problems that affected
his play down south.
"Jon is struggling with nagging in
juries," Shaw said. "I don't know his
status for UCLA."
"Stanford doesn't have a deep
bench," Scates said. "An injury al
ways hurts them. And Jon is such a
quality player they can't afford to lose
him."
Asbjorn Volstaad, a junior from
Forde, Norway, leads the Bruins with
305 kills and a .340 average. Jeff Wil
liams, another junior, follows with
239 kills. The top blocker for UCLA
is sophomore Don Dendinger, who
has 119 blocks, 29 of those solo. He
also has 207 kills and a .343
percentage.
"Volstaad and Williams have been
playing well lately," Scates said. "But
we don't go to anyone in particular."
"They're trying new things with a
different lineup," outside hitter Blue
said. "We have a good chance. We
went five at home, and we've got a lot
of confidence."

two of three at home to make the
regionals if we split on the road." The
senior All-American will look to
recover from recurring ankle injuries
and shoulder problems that affected
his play down south.
"Jon is struggling with nagging in
juries," Shaw said. "I don't know his
status for UCLA."
"Stanford doesn't have a deep
bench," Scates said. "An injury al
ways hurts them. And Jon is such a
quality player they can't afford to lose
him."
Asbjorn Volstaad, a junior from
Forde, Norway, leads the Bruins with
305 kills and a .340 average. Jeff Wil
liams, another junior, follows with
239 kills. The top blocker for UCLA
is sophomore Don Dendinger, who
has 119 blocks, 29 of those solo. He
also has 207 kills and a .343
percentage.
"Volstaad and Williams have been
playing well lately," Scates said. "But
we don't go to anyone in particular."
"They're trying new things with a
different lineup," outside hitter Blue
said. "We have a good chance. We
went five at home, and we've got a lot
of confidence."
