### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Just three months after Kim Oden played the last game of her heralded
Cardinal career, Stanford Co-coaches Don Shaw and Fred Sturm replenished
the stock of the women's volleyball team by signing three top recruits for the
1986 season.
Shaw and Sturm announced the signings of Lara Asper of Newport Beach,
Jessica Benton of San Diego and Jenny Chaffee of Colorado Springs, Colo, on
March 24.
"We consider this to be a very good recruiting class," Shaw said. "We got
three quality kids."
Asper. a 5-foot-1 I setter from Newport Harbor High School, was named a
first-team high school All-American by Volleyball Monthly and Player of the
Year by the Los Angeles Times for the 1985 season.
"Asper may be the most experienced of the three players." Shaw said. "We
expect that she'll follow Wendi Rush right along at setter. Lara was one of the
very top recruits in the nation, and we feel lucky to get her."
Benton starred in both volleyball and basketball at Point Loma High School.
During the 85-'B6 school year, the 6-4 Benton was named the Eastern
League's Most Valuable Player in volleyball and averaged 10 points and nine
rebounds for Point Loma's women's basketball team, which won the California
Division I state title.
At 6-2. Chaffee will add more height to the Cardinal attack. Last season she
was a Volleyball Monthly second-team high school All-American as well as
the Colorado Player of the Year.
Shaw indicated that either Benton or Chaffee may replace Oden as middle
blocker. "No doubt there will be a huge vacancy at middle blocker, but either
Benton or Chaffee could challenge for the position." Shaw said.
"All three recruits are big and athletic." Shaw added. "We have definitely
given ourselves more depth and made ourselves more versatile."
