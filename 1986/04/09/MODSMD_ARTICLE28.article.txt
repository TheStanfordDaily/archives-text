Power-sharing rules are unveiled
PARIS — Socialist President Francois Mitterrand yesterday laid out
the ground rules for the power-sharing arrangement between him and
the country's new right-wing government, telling the National Assembly
that he would act to preserve their constitutional prerogatives from pos
sible governmental encroachment.
The president's defense of the rights of parliament came in a message
to the assembly on the functioning of what has become known here as
"cohabitation."' This is a French term used to describe the division of ex
ecutive power between political opponents following the narrow right
wing victory in last month's parliamentary election.
Mitterrand said that the election created an unprecedented situation
in the 28-year histoiy of France's Fifth Republic, the first time that parli
ament and government were controlled by political parties opposed to
the president.
The president, whose term does not expire until 1988, insisted that
France's political institutions were strong enough to survive the chal
lenge as long as everyone respected "the Constitution, nothing but the
Constitution, the whole Constitution."
Political commentators here interpreted Mitterrand's intervention as
an attempt to show that he accepts the outcome of the election but will
not allow the new conservative government complete freedom of action.
The government's program is to be formally unveiled in a speech to the
assembly, the main chamber of parliament, by conservative Prime Mini
ster Jacques Chirac today.
While acknowledging that the previous Socialist government had
ruled by decree. Mitterrand said that they should be both few in number
and well-defined in order to respect the rights of parliament. He noted
that the Socialists had not used decrees to enact major reforms such as
nationalizations and the codification of the rights of workers.
Strikes cripple Norwegian industry
OSLO, Norway — The biggest labor dispute to hit Norway in 55 years
saw more than 100,000 workers on strike or locked out yesterday as five
major trade unions pressed demands for more pay and a shorter work
week.
Unions and employers were called in for a night-time meeting with
Labor Market Minister Arne Rettedal, but with no result.
The conflict came less than 24 hours after Norwegian oil and gas pro
duction closed down as 670 food service workers went on strike in the
North Sea, and 3,600 oil production workers were locked out.
Chief State Mediator Bjoern Haug announced shortly before mid
night that he had given up mediation in the five sectors: the metal,
textile, building, electro-chemical and catering industries.
First victims of the conflict were Norway's two biggest daily
newspapers, Aftenposten and Verdens Gang, which failed to appear
after metal union workers walked out.
Foreign visitors to Norway were also among those to feel the effects.
The conflict closed down most hotels and restaurants throughout the
country, and residents at all major hotels in Oslo were asked to check
out by noon yesterday.
Beirut car-bombing claims 9 lives
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A powerful car-bomb exploded yesterday in
Jounieh, a Christian port city 12 miles north of Beirut, killing at least
nine persons and wounding 34.
Police said the car, packed with 150 pounds of explosives, was parked
on the main square and exploded at 1:10 p.m. as the area was crowded
with shoppers and employees going to lunch.
The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio said most of the casualties were
either pedestrians or employees of two banks, the Credit Lyonnais and
the Brazilian Bank.
The explosion was the latest in a series of bomb attacks on Christian
areas that started Jan. 21. Most of them have been targeted at offices of
President Amin Gemayel's Phalange Party.
Refugees denied entry to Singapore
SINGAPORE — A group of 350 Vietnamese refugees who arrived
here yesterday on board a West German mercy ship have not been per
mitted to disembark due to the island-nation's tough policy on refugee
movements, officials said.
The CAP Anamour 11, which picked up the refugees from a small
flotilla of boats in the South China Sea, is now anchored in Singapore
harbor awaiting directions from the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees headquarters in Geneva.
The United Nations is trying to find a country willing to accept the
refugees, and once the green light is given, the ship will leave Singapore
immediately, a U.N. official said here.
The official added that the ship might head for the Philippines.
The CAP Anamour 11, originally a cargo vessel, was converted into a
mercy vessel in Singapore late last month for rescuing refugees. It was
the first major rescue operation it had made since its conversion.
A shipping official said CAP Anamour II was sighted rescuing the
refugees from a flotilla of small boats north of the Indonesian Natunas
Islands not far from the disputed Spratly Islands.
Alleged plot to kill Aquino studied
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine military authorities are inves
tigating an alleged plot to assassinate President Corazon Aquino during
her victory rally last month, top military and government officials said
yesterday.
The military also announced that it has stepped up security at the na
tion's major airports amid intelligence reports that forces loyal to
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos may attempt to smuggle arms or
men into the country in an effort to destabilize Aquino's 6-week-old
government.
Authorities said the investigation into a possible assassination plot
began Monday night when investigators from Aquino's presidential
guard battalion took into custody a 39-year-old man from Aquino's
home province of Tarlac.
The man reportedly had confessed to police that he had been paid
500,000 pesos, about $25,000, to shoot the new president as she ap
peared before one million supporters during a March 2 "thanksgiving
rally." according to a senior police superintendent.
Italy suspends all wine exports
ROME — A widening wine scandal that has left at least 20 persons
dead so far from methyl alcohol poisoning yesterday forced Italy to
suspend all wine exports until they can be certified safe.
The export freeze, announced at a special Common Market meeting
in Brussels, seemed to confirm the opinion of Italian experts that Italy
may face the most serious wine scandal in history.
The deaths followed adulteration of some cheap Italian wines with
methyl, or wood, alcohol to raise the wines' alcohol content to the
average 12 percent.
Contamination so far has not been found in high quality Italian wines
normally exported to the United States under labels marked "DOC," or
"Denominazione di Origine Controllata.' The term refers to Italian
laws controlling high quality wines from growth through production and
sales.
The scandal has struck cheap bulk wines sold to neighboring
European countries for mixing with their own local wines. Also impl
icated are inexpensive, unpedigreed wines sold here as "Vino di Tavola"
for regional export and local consumption at bargain rates so low that
only adulterated wines can be profitable.
