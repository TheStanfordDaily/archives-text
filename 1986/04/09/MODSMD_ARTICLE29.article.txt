# U.S. launches peace initiative

MANAMA, Bahrain — Vice President George
Bush announced yesterday that he had sent Asst.
Secretary of State Richard Murphy to Israel to
launch a new Middle East peace effort and warned
that the United States would "not wait for an invi
tation" to intervene militarily to keep the Persian
Gulf open.
"We did not wait for an invitation to go to the
Gulf of Sidra to defend the principle of free naviga
tion," Bush told a press conference here, referring
to the recent confrontation between the U.S. Navy
and Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafi.
Bush indicated that similar intervention would
be possible if tanker lanes at the Strait of Hormuz
were threatened by Iran or if the Iranians tried to
expand their war with Iraq to Arab countries in the
region that are friendly with the United States.
Bush declined to give any details on what
prompted Murphy's trip to Israel. He did not say
either whether the State Department's trouble
shooter was carrying any new ideas communicated
to Bush at his earlier meetings with Saudi King
Fahd and Bahrain ruler Sheik Isa bin Sulman al-
Khalifa.
Bush refused to answer directly a question on
whether the United States felt it was time for Brit
ain to "make a gesture" to the Organization of Pe
troleum Exporting Countries in order to end the

current oil price war. However, he did not come
out against such a step.
Bush was asked whether the United States
agreed with a suggestion by Bahrain's foreign mini
ster, Sheik Mohammed bin Mubarak, that oil prices
should be raised and maintained at $20 per barrel.
He replied that he doubted that anybody, includ
ing Saudi Arabia, had a definite idea on what the
suitable price for oil should be. He said this would
have to depend on market forces.
The vice president, in what appeared to be a
departure from previous U.S. positions, said it was
natural for Britain and other non-OPEC producers
to be holding contacts with the cartel on the oil
market situation.
"It is up to the United Kingdom," he said when
pressed for an answer on whether Britain should
cooperate with OPEC.
He explained in detail America's concern as a
major producer and consumer of oil but did not say
whether the United States could contribute in any
way to achieving the generally accepted aim of
market stability.
Bush acknowledged that there was growing Arab
disenchantment with U.S. policies on the Arab-
Israeli issue but said the United States was sin
cerely seeking to act as a catalyst for peace.
"We do have a special relationship with Israel

. . . and I know what you are saying," he told an
Arab journalist who complained bitterly that
Washington was "hitting us in every way" even
though most Arab countries regarded America as
their "best friend."
It was partly to alleviate and respond to Arab
concerns that Murphy had embarked on his new
mission. Bush said. He specifically referred to
"constructive elements" in twin peace plans — pro
posed within days of each other in September 1982
by both President Reagan and Saudi King Fahd —
but did not elaborate.
Bush blamed Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat for the current deadlock
because, he said, Arafat retracted a political agree
ment with King Hussein of Jordan which the
United States had hoped would open the road for
peace.
Arafat's stance was a major disappointment for
Hussein and for the United States, Bush said.
The PLO has insisted on a clear stipulation for
Palestinian self-determination rights before accept
ing U.N. resolutions that Hussein advocates as a
framework for Arab-Israeli peace talks.
Bush was due to leave later for the Sultanate of
Oman, where Hussein is currently holding talks
with Sultan Qabus bin Said under a tight veil of
secrecy.
