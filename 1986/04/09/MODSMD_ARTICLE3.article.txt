# Kennedy rebuffs Manley in letter
## Claims prof. distorted facts 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday countered a flurry of
jabs from Political Science Prof. John
Manley, saying the outspoken profes
sor's complaints "have no merit."
Kennedy released a letter to Man
ley late yesterday afternoon refuting
his allegations that the Kennedy ad
ministration stifles open discussion
and ignores human values.
"The governance of Stanford is
vested mainly in its several con
stituencies," Kennedy said.
"However uncomfortable it may be
for you, the fact is that they and not I
are responsible for most of the posi
tions with which you disagree."
Kennedy said Manley is frustrated
because he has failed to get the back
ing of his colleagues in many debates.
"You find it difficult to admit your
failure to convince your own col
leagues," he wrote. "To escape that
reality, you have invented an oppres
sor."
Kennedy told Manley in the letter
that the tenured professor had dis
torted facts and made several false as
sertions, including a charge that the
University gave him a lower-than
average salary raise because of his
criticism of alleged political activities
at the Hoover Institution.
"I urge you to abandon the false
assertion that your salary increase is
in any way retaliatory," Kennedy
said. "I think you know that is not
true: but in any event, abundant due
process has been available to you in

your effort to prove that it is."
Kennedy said Manley's current
salary appeal is valid hut noted that
"an impartial faculty grievance offi
cer appointed by the provost has
found no merit in your claim that the
raise was based on anything other
than your performance as a faculty
member."
Kennedy addressed several other
specific charges:
• Asked about Manley's assertion
that hearings on Stanford-Hoover
ties are held behind closed doors,
Kennedy said last night, "Only if the
senate s a closed door."
In his letter, the president said:
"You heard on Thursday a thorough
report to the Senate of the Academic
Council on the provost's and my
response to the recommendations of
a faculty committee. Following that,
the chair of that committee and other
members of the senate commended
that work, with but a single dissenting
voice."
• Kennedy addressed Manley's com
plaint that the administration subor
dinates teaching to research, saying
that "all first-rate universities have
high standards for research," and that
"decisions not to promote or to ap
point are peer judgments initiated at
the departmental level: they are not
administrative."
• Kennedy accused Manley of dis
torting the text of the president's
Freshman Orientation address "by
joining quotes taken out of context in
a way that would never be acceptable
• He said Manley had referred to the Univer
sity's "anti-labor reputation" without citing any
evidence.
• Kennedy denied charges that the creation of
the Center for Integrated Systems deepens
Stanford's connections with the military
industrial complex.
• He argued that Stanford's policy of not
judging scientific research on its end-use was es
tablished by the University's Committee on Re
search, a faculty committee with student

membership. Manley had said that the Univer
sity rejected an open forum on the matter. Ken
nedy countered that the Committee on
Research held public hearings and that there
was no rejection of an open forum.
In an interview last night, Kennedy said he
had hoped to deliver his letter to Manley before
delivering it to the press, but noted that Manley
had passed up the opportunity.
He criticized Manley for sending his letter to
newspapers before delivering it to the Presi
dent's Office. "If you were seriously interested
in a dialogue about leadership in the University,
you would have addressed your colleagues first
and the newspapers second, not the other way
around," Kennedy wrote.
