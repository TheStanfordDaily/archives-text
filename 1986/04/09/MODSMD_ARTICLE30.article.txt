# Shuttle findings to be heard
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — NASA inves
tigators will give their preliminary
findings on the Challenger space
shuttle disaster to members of a pres
idential panel tomorrow, apparently
concluding that a flawed joint design
was the underlying cause of the ex
plosion that killed seven crew mem
bers.
After hauling tons of wreckage
from the ocean floor, searching
records and conducting about 300
tests focusing on the solid rocket joint
that spewed smoke and flame in the
seconds after the shuttle lifted off, ex
perts have been unable to find any
thing that set the doomed booster
apart from others launched in the
shuttle program.
J.R. Thompson, chief investigator
for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, told reporters
in Florida yesterday that he expects
that "several factors" will be deter
mined to have played a part in the

tragedy, which has brought the U.S.
space program to a standstill.
He said he finds "plausible" a two
step scenario in which a leak was
created in a joint of Challengers right
solid rocket booster a split-second
after ignition but did not become a
catastrophic problem until the
spacecraft hit a heavy, high-altitude
wind shear.
The team conducting NASA's in
ternal investigation of the accident is
due to give its final report to the pres
idential commission on April 18, but
Thompson described tomorrow's
meeting with commission members at
the agency's Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala., as an oc
casion for "a major data dump."
The presidential panel is to report
its finding of the accident's probable
cause in early June.
Thompson said the NASA inquiry
is now focused on four factors that
could have been involved in the se
quence leading to the explosion 72

seconds after Challenger was
launched Jan. 28:
• "Joint rotation" occurring with
engine ignition and creating enor
mous pressure inside the solid
boosters.
• Performance of the putty that is de
signed to protect the airtight seal in
the joints between the rockets' seg
ments.
• Effects of subfreezing temperatures
through the night before the
spacecraft was launched.
• Alignment of the rocket segments,
which had to be forced into position
when the booster was assembled a
month before launch.
Thompson said that several factors
could have been involved, beginning
at ignition and continuing until the
shuttle erupted in a massive fireball.
But rather than the accident being
caused by something unique about
the Challenger vehicle, he told
reporters, "I think we were walking
right on the edge of a cliff, and

several of these factors just pushed us
over."
He refused to discuss the continu
ing search for debris from Chal
lenger's crew compartment, but he
said the top priority now is to find
pieces of the right solid booster in
hopes of finding the section of the
rocket joint where the failure
curred.
The theory that a high-altitude
wind shear could have been a factor
in the accident was raised at a
meeting of the presidential commis
sion last month when Maj. Gen.
Donald Kutyna observed that the
shuttle "was going on a fairly bumpy
road" just before the explosion.
According to this theory, the joint
might have been "weakened" upon
ignition but still sealed and per
formed adequately until the shuttle
reached the period of maximum
launch stress and encountered a wind
shear in the upper atmosphere.
