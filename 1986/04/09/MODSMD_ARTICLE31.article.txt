China to buy U.S. arms
WASHINGTON — In the first major sale of
U.S. military equipment to China, the Reagan
Administration disclosed yesterday that it would
sell sophisticated aircraft radar and computers to
that nation.
In announcing the $550 million sale of ad
vanced aircraft equipment, anticipated for more
than two months, the Pentagon said it would
benefit U.S. foreign policy and security "by help
ing to improve the security of a friendly country
which has been an important force for political
stability and economic progress in Asia and the
world."
The Administration's proposal represents a
major step in the still-developing U.S.-Chinese
relationship, particularly in the unexplored but
potentially significant area of arms sales.
Nuclear test is delayed
WASHINGTON — A controversial U.S. un
derground nuclear-weapons test scheduled for
yesterday was delayed because of technical prob
lems, according to Administration and congres
sional sources.

Department of Energy (DOE) officials say
they expect that the nuclear test, designed
primarily to determine effects of radiation on
new strategic warheads, will take place today,
sources said.
The test has drawn protesters to the Nevada
Test Site and objections from Capitol Hill be
cause it could trigger the end of an eight-month
Soviet test moratorium. Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev said last month that the first U.S. test
after March 3 1 would cause him to order re
sumption of Soviet nuclear-weapons tests.
The delayed U.S. test, which was first planned
by the Defense Nuclear Agency more than a year
ago, would have taken place as President Reagan
was discussing the next summit during a farewell
talk with departing Soviet ambassador Anatoly
Dobiynin.
U.S. might aid Contras
WASHINGTON — The collapse of the Con
tadora peace talks in Central America will cause
Congress to approve President Reagan's request
for $100 million in aid to the Nicaraguan insur
gency, Republican leaders predicted yesterday.
As a result. House Assistant Minority Leader

Trent Lott (R-Miss.) predicted that the House
will vote next week to approve a Senate-passed
measure that would permit unrestricted military
aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras,
after a 90-day waiting period intended to foster
negotiations in the region.
But Democrats who oppose the aid insisted
that the president was as much to blame for the
collapse in talks as the Nicaraguans. Rep. Mi
chael Barnes of Maryland, one of three House
Democrats who went to Panama City to observe
the talks during the weekend, said that a Con
tadora agreement "may not be possible so long as
the United States supports the contras and is
committed to the overthrow of the Sandinista
regime."
Big board prices surge
NEW YORK — The stock market roared
ahead yesterday, emerging from a steep slump, as
interest rates and oil prices resumed their des
cent.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
surged 34.25 to 1,769.76, its best gain since
March 14, when it jumped 39.03 points and the
10th biggest daily increase ever.
