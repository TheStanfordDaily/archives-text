Eastwood elected mayor
CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA — Voters in this
tourist village made Clint Eastwood's day yester
day, turning out in heavy numbers to give the
Hollywood tough guy a landslide victory in a
mayoral election.
With three of four precincts and absentee bal
lots counted, Eastwood had 1,712 votes, or 72.1
percent, to 663 votes, or 27.9 percent, for two
time incumbent Charlotte Townsend.
The partial returns represented 57.4 percent of
the 4,142 registered voters in the tiny resort vil
lage.
Eastwood, 55, was making his first try for of
fice against Townsend, a 61-year-old retired li
brarian. and Timothy Grady, a 27-year-old dish
washer who said he wanted to tear up some
streets in favor of horse trails.
In absentee ballots, Grady received one vote
and businessman Paul Laub, who quit and threw
his support behind Eastwood, received four
votes.
The winner takes over the $200-a-month, two
year job on April 15.
"We're feeling good," Eastwood said as the
campaign drew to a close.
He had taken more than a year off from his

acting and directing career and promised voters
he would make the mayor's job his top priority.
Eastwood chided the horde of 400 reporters
from around the country. Europe and Japan who
have descended on Carmel.

"What do you all care about this?" he said.
"You'll all be gone after tomorrow."
Dancers seek asylum
SAN FRANCISCO — Members of a black
South African dance troupe who have repeatedly
decried their government's racial policies during
six years of performances in the United States re
quested political asylum here yesterday.
The performers, who are facing deportation
proceedings, are members of the Uzulu Dance
Theatre. Their attorney, Bill May, told an im
migration judge at a hearing yesterday the
performers will face persecution if sent home.
The judge gave the performers four months to
prepare material to support their application. A
hearing was set for June 5, 1987. No earlier date
was available due to the heavy backlog before the
four immigration judges here.
Go ahead, make it gray
Overcast skies today with patchy fog becoming
partly sunny, or else. Highs in the low 70s. Con
gratulations, Clint.
