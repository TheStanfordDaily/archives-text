### ANDREA ARNOLD 
The Creative Writing Program at Stanford, along
with the lowa Writer's Workshop, is acknowledged
to be one of the top graduate writing programs in
the country.

Feature

"I would like someday to see it No. 1 — Stanford,
not lowa," says John L'Heureux, director of the
Creative Writing Program here.
L'Heureux was educated at Holy Cross, Boston
College and Harvard University, where he earned
advanced degrees in psychology, theology and En
glish literature.
He has published four books of poetry and six
books of fiction, and his stories and poems have ap-
peared in numerous anthologies. His
next novel, "Lies," will be published
later this year. He has also served as
staff editor and contributing editor of
The Atlantic magazine.
L'Heureux has taught at George
town, Tufts and Harvard. Since 1973,
he has been teaching at Stanford,
where he is currently the Melvin and
Bill Lane Professor in Humanities.
L'Heureux has at least one charac
teristic that is rare among most col
lege English professors: for 16 years,
he was a Jesuit priest. He points out
that if someone spends that length of
time at anything, it is likely to affect
him for the rest of his life.
He says that his experience as a
priest affected his writing because
"the Jesuits propose as an ideal to
think logically, to express oneself
clearly, forcefully, and if possible,
elegantly."
This is L'Heureux's primary con
cern in teaching those who are ac
cepted into the Creative Writing Pro
gram. Every year there are about 500
applicants to the program; some ap
ply to the program for a master's,
some apply for the Stegner Fellow
ship and some apply for both. At least
half of these applicants are published
writers.

But being published is not a re
quirement for being accepted to the
program. L'Heureux says that each of
the six people who review the appli
cations looks for something different.
"Some look for ability to tell a
story, some look for individuality of
voice. 1 tend to look for signs of life,
of vitality, of energy that proceeds
not from the writer himself, or her
self, but from the characters on the
page. I look for a kind of individuality
that is not just self-indulgence, be
cause a lot of individuality is
sometimes just that," he says.
L'Heureux describes self
indulgence as "the difference be
tween a writer trying to hold up
something for illumination, and a
writer trying to show off."
Twenty-four people are admitted
to the program each year, 12 fiction
writers and 12 poets, L"Heureux says.
He notes that "probably a higher
percentage of workshop graduates
(from Stanford] than from any other
program in the country become suc
cessful writers." He also admits that
"part of that is because our program
is so small — but selective."
Many graduates from the Creative
Writing Program remain in the
writing field. Some become novelists,
while others become editors,
screenwriters, poets or teachers.

Some success stories from Stan
ford's program include Harriet
Doerr, author of "Stones for Ibarra,"
which won the American Book
Award in 1984. Ivy Goodman, au
thor of "Heart Failure," won the
lowa Short Fiction Award in 1983.
Last year, Tobias Wolff won the PEN/
Faulkner Award for "The Barracks
Thief."
Despite the obvious success of
some of the program s graduates,
L'Heureux denies the possibility of
teaching someone to be a writer.
"It is impossible to teach anyone to
be a writer," he says. "We try to pick
people who are already potentially
writers. We can teach them tech
nique. We can't teach them talent,
and we can't teach them genius or vi
sion. We can help them discover their
material, realize their talent and focus
their vision."
L'Heureux points out that
"teaching technique can save a lot of
time."
Although natural talent is neces
sary to becoming a writer, it isn't al
ways enough. With the Creative
Writing Program, a potential author
may develop his or her style faster,
taking one year to do in the program
what he or she might be able to do
alone in 10 years, he says.

The Creative Writing Program is
not L'Heureux's only occupation. He
also teaches a drama survey course to
non-English majors. His class is a
casual one that encourages students
to ask questions at any point. "I try to
make my class half discussion, half
lecture," he says, noting that this can
be hard with 80 students.
Commenting on what his students
might think of him, L'Heureux says,
"I think students to whom I teach
writing think I know what I am
talking about, and I am very accessi
ble. I do like them and care a great
deal about their work. They know
that."
L'Heureux's favorite author is Jane
Austen. "Despite her narrow range,
she is probably the most economical
writer who has ever written," he says.
"She is also a very funny writer. She
keeps just enough distance from her
characters so she can write about
them in a way that cuts to the bone.
There are very few elements of
human folly that she hasn't annotated
and dismissed. She's witty, profound
and absolutely delightful."
L'Heureux also enjoys reading
George Eliot, Flannery O'Connor,
Saul Bellow, Robert Stone, "and the
wolves" — Virginia Woolf and
Tobias Wolff.

writers and 12 poets, L"Heureux says.
He notes that "probably a higher
percentage of workshop graduates
(from Stanford] than from any other
program in the country become suc
cessful writers." He also admits that
"part of that is because our program
is so small — but selective."
Many graduates from the Creative
Writing Program remain in the
writing field. Some become novelists,
while others become editors,
screenwriters, poets or teachers.

Some success stories from Stan
ford's program include Harriet
Doerr, author of "Stones for Ibarra,"
which won the American Book
Award in 1984. Ivy Goodman, au
thor of "Heart Failure," won the
lowa Short Fiction Award in 1983.
Last year, Tobias Wolff won the PEN/
Faulkner Award for "The Barracks
Thief."
Despite the obvious success of
some of the program s graduates,
L'Heureux denies the possibility of
teaching someone to be a writer.
"It is impossible to teach anyone to
be a writer," he says. "We try to pick
people who are already potentially
writers. We can teach them tech
nique. We can't teach them talent,
and we can't teach them genius or vi
sion. We can help them discover their
material, realize their talent and focus
their vision."
L'Heureux points out that
"teaching technique can save a lot of
time."
Although natural talent is neces
sary to becoming a writer, it isn't al
ways enough. With the Creative
Writing Program, a potential author
may develop his or her style faster,
taking one year to do in the program
what he or she might be able to do
alone in 10 years, he says.

The Creative Writing Program is
not L'Heureux's only occupation. He
also teaches a drama survey course to
non-English majors. His class is a
casual one that encourages students
to ask questions at any point. "I try to
make my class half discussion, half
lecture," he says, noting that this can
be hard with 80 students.
Commenting on what his students
might think of him, L'Heureux says,
"I think students to whom I teach
writing think I know what I am
talking about, and I am very accessi
ble. I do like them and care a great
deal about their work. They know
that."
L'Heureux's favorite author is Jane
Austen. "Despite her narrow range,
she is probably the most economical
writer who has ever written," he says.
"She is also a very funny writer. She
keeps just enough distance from her
characters so she can write about
them in a way that cuts to the bone.
There are very few elements of
human folly that she hasn't annotated
and dismissed. She's witty, profound
and absolutely delightful."
L'Heureux also enjoys reading
George Eliot, Flannery O'Connor,
Saul Bellow, Robert Stone, "and the
wolves" — Virginia Woolf and
Tobias Wolff.

Prof. John L' Heureux, now director of Stanford's Creative Writing
Program, has taught at several universities, written ten books, worked
as an editor at The Atlantic magazine and served as a Jesuit priest for
16 years.
The Creative Writing Program at Stanford, along
with the lowa Writer's Workshop, is acknowledged
to be one of the top graduate writing programs in
the country.

"I would like someday to see it No. 1 — Stanford,
not lowa," says John L'Heureux, director of the
Creative Writing Program here.
L'Heureux was educated at Holy Cross, Boston
College and Harvard University, where he earned
advanced degrees in psychology, theology and En
glish literature.
He has published four books of poetry and six
books of fiction, and his stories and poems have ap-
peared in numerous anthologies. His
next novel, "Lies," will be published
later this year. He has also served as
staff editor and contributing editor of
The Atlantic magazine.
L'Heureux has taught at George
town, Tufts and Harvard. Since 1973,
he has been teaching at Stanford,
where he is currently the Melvin and
Bill Lane Professor in Humanities.
L'Heureux has at least one charac
teristic that is rare among most col
lege English professors: for 16 years,
he was a Jesuit priest. He points out
that if someone spends that length of
time at anything, it is likely to affect
him for the rest of his life.
He says that his experience as a
priest affected his writing because
"the Jesuits propose as an ideal to
think logically, to express oneself
clearly, forcefully, and if possible,
elegantly."
This is L'Heureux's primary con
cern in teaching those who are ac
cepted into the Creative Writing Pro
gram. Every year there are about 500
applicants to the program; some ap
ply to the program for a master's,
some apply for the Stegner Fellow
ship and some apply for both. At least
half of these applicants are published
writers.

But being published is not a re
quirement for being accepted to the
program. L'Heureux says that each of
the six people who review the appli
cations looks for something different.
"Some look for ability to tell a
story, some look for individuality of
voice. 1 tend to look for signs of life,
of vitality, of energy that proceeds
not from the writer himself, or her
self, but from the characters on the
page. I look for a kind of individuality
that is not just self-indulgence, be
cause a lot of individuality is
sometimes just that," he says.
L'Heureux describes self
indulgence as "the difference be
tween a writer trying to hold up
something for illumination, and a
writer trying to show off."
Twenty-four people are admitted
to the program each year, 12 fiction
writers and 12 poets, L"Heureux says.
