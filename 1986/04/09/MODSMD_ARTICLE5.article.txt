# Admissions decisions mailed

### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
Thousands of high school seniors are no longer
anxiously watching their mailboxes. Stanford mailed
admission, rejection and wait-list letters for the class of
1988 Friday.
The Office of Admissions is "ecstatic about the class
to whom we've offered admission," said Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter.
From an applicant pool of 16.135, admission was of
fered to 2,520. in an attempt to create a freshman class
of approximately 1.500.
"We wish they could all come."' Fetter said.
Stanford is already receiving responses from the
recipients of the fateful letters, and the year's first case
of a prospective freshman (pro-fro) staying overnight
in a student dormitory occurred last night. Fetter said.
Pro-froscan arrange through the Admissions Office
to experience some of Stanford life by eating dor
mitory food and/or spending the night in a host s dorm
room.
The Admissions Office has also arranged for repre
sentatives from the schools ol Humanities and
Sciences, Earth Sciences and Engineering to be in the

Admissions Office on the evenings of April 17 and
April 22 to answer questions posed by pro-fros.
" As soon as I saw the letter, and it was thick, 1 knew
I was in," said Julie Tinklenberg, a senior at Palo Alto
High School who said Stanford was her first choice.
With the admissions letters came a packet including
information on visiting Stanford, a campus map,
pictures of the admissions staff and information on two
types of financial aid.
"Frightening," was how Assistant Director of Un
dergraduate Admissions Cheri Ross characterized the
inclusion of financial aid information with the admis
sion letters.
Fetter signed each admission letter. Although she
does not have a trademark like former Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Fred Hargadon's "Great," Fetter
said she wrote a personal note on the bottom of each
letter.
Now that the difficult process of reading each appli
cation at least two times is finished. Fetter says that the
admissions staff is "absolutely exhausted."
I he staff is now dealing with a "combination of the
joys.'' of those who were admitted and the
"disappointment" of those who were not.
