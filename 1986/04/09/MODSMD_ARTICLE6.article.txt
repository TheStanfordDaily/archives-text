### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Norm Robinson calls it
"conversation with a clear mind."
Diana Conklin calls it "a nervy
thing to do."
Sigma Phi Epsilon calls it "dry
Rush."
The unhoused Stanford fraternity
is serving no alcohol at its 1986 Rush
parties, which begin tonight.
Sig Ep Rush Chairman Jason
Parada explains that the national Sig
Ep organization has asked its chap
ters at each university to de
emphasize alcohol during Rush. The
Stanford chapter, after much deliber
ation. voted to honor the request.
"Rush is serious to us," Parada
said. "Fraternities can mean a lot to
people, and we really want to show

what we ie like."
Senior officials in the Office of
Residential Education are pleased
with Sig Ep's new policy.
"It bespeaks real self-confidence,"
said Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
Student Affairs. "They are confident
that they can attract people based on
the qualities of the group, not based
on (alcohol)."
Conklin, not well known for lavish
ing fraternities with praise, called Sig
Ep "a really remarkably good
group."
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
Student Affairs, said the fraternity's
non-alcoholic rush will help to dispel
the stereotype of fraternities as or
ganizations that focus on drinking.
"The feeling is that in order to have a
good time, you must have alcohol,"
he said.

Robinson said the dry Rush will
"let people not worry about things
that are always on people's mind . . .
whether or not they should be drink
ing, how much they should drink,
whether or not they can hold their al
cohol."
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano also praised the Sig Ep frater
nity, calling it "a very progressive
group" and saying ''there is much to
gain and little to lose" from holding a
dry Rush.
"It's important to separate the
process of membership selection from
partying," he said.
Sigma Phi Epsilon formed at Stan
ford out of a nine-member intramural
team. The fraternity received formal
recognition from the University
about two years ago and was granted
chapter status by its national organi
zation last May.
