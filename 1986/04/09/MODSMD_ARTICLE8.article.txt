UC-Berkeley police cleared a human block
ade from a campus administration building yes
terday afternoon and arrested 12 student
protesters in another anti-apartheid demonstra
tion there.
"What we are asking for is for the University
to break ties with South Africa and end racism
on this campus," said Alice Bell of the Com
mitte Against Apartheid. ''We are hoping to
force the university to deal with us on these is
sues."
The blockade was sponsored by a number of
UC-Berkeley organizations, including the
United People of Color, Committee Against
Apartheid, UC Divestment Committee, African
Students Association and the Association of
Graduate Student Employees.
More than 200 demonstrators blocked Cali
fornia Hall's four entrances at 7 a.m. yesterday,
preventing employees from entering the build
ing. At 1:40 p.m., the crowd allowed six univer
sity employees, who had entered the building
before the blockade was formed, to leave.
Soon after, the UC campus police arrived,
backed up by Berkeley city police and Alameda
County sheriffs deputies. A crowd of support
ers estimated between 1,000 and l,soocheered
the protesters as the police made the arrests and

cleared a pathway from one of California Hall's
doors to an adjacent building.
The demonstration was described as '"non
violent" by one observer. One of the protesters
allegedly threw an apple core at police and was
immediately reprimanded by other protesters
who chanted, " Don't throw."
Anti-apartheid protests at Berkeley grew vi
olent last week, with protesters claiming police
had overreacted and beat some students, while
police charged that protesters threw rocks at
them. Yesterday, however, police, dressed in
regular uniforms and not the riot gear they wore
last week, allowed the protest to continue for
several hours before breaking it up.
In an unusual gesture, UC-Berkeley Chancel
lor I. Michael Heyman met to negotiate with 12
of the protesters at 10 a.m. He agreed to one of
the protesters' demands: to stop sales of IBM
and Hewlett-Packard products on campus
through the end of the school year, according to
the Daily Californian. Those companies are un -
der attack from various student organizations
for doing business in South Africa.
The protesters pledged to blockade Califor
nia Hall again at 7 this morning in an effort to
force the university into meeting the rest of
their 12 demands, including a meeting of the
UC Board of Regents for the sole purpose of
discussing divestment.
"This is not going to die down, it's going to
continue," Bell said.
