Police are still looking for the man, who
they say was probably not a Stanford stu

The victim said she met the man Friday af
ternoon near Tresidder Union on her way
back to her Governors Corner residence
and let him carry her books home. When
they arrived at the house, the woman said,
she asked the man to wait in the lobby while
she went to her room.
But the man, who she described as "really
clean cut," followed her and made physical
advances in her room, she said.

" There was definitely not a rape," Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington said.
"He came on physically, then stopped. . . .
But the fact is that he touched her. That's
technically asexual assault."
Herrington said the woman and the man
talked briefly after the confrontation, and
then the man walked away.
According to the description the victim
gave police, the man is a white male between
30 and 35. He is believed to have blue eyes,
brown hair with blond streaks and a 5-foot
-10, medium build. Herrington said.
The victim said she is "terrified of appear
ing in court," but told police of the incident
in order to spare other women similar con
frontations, she said.
