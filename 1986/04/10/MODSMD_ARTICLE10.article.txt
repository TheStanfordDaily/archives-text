# S.A. scholar speaks on trade unions, protests

### JIM GUNTON Staff writer 
"This union will continue to grow. It is far
and away the most dynamic and fast-growing
union in South Africa," said Dave Lewis,
former general secretary of the General
Workers' Union in South Africa.
Lewis spoke yesterday as part of Bechtel
International Center's Africa Table.
He opened his discussion by noting that it
might "seem indulgent to talk about the
trade union movement given all that is hap
pening at Berkeley and other campuses
across the country, including here." He
added, however, that "trade unions are very
important," and therefore deserved the at
tention he was giving it.
One of the "more spectacular" elements
of the union workers is that although they
are "principally illiterate longshoremen,"
this fact "hasn't prevented them from being
authentic leaders in South Africa
(government) or from being tough
negotiators."
One issue that seemed to draw special in
terest from the audience was whether or not
indigenous communist sentiment had been
or would in the future be able to find expres
sion in such trade union organizations.
"The Communist Party is illegal," Lewis

said. "Technically there can't be a relation
ship between the unions and the African Na
tional Congress." The ANC is illegal because
of its close relationship to communism, he
added.
But "there is a sympathy for the Commu
nist Party," he said.
Lewis also talked about the shaky condi
tions that presently exist between the trade
unions and both the state and South African
industry. "It's as you would expect it to be,"
he said, "antagonistic and tense."
Lewis said he feels that a complete out
break of civil war in South Africa is unlikely.
"1 think that there is kind of a low-intensity
civil war going on right now. However, I
think that a complete collapse of the civil or
der is unlikely. The possibility of preventing
this collapse doesn't lie with the present civil
government, though."
Lewis added that the ideological direction
of any new government was still up in the air.
However, Lewis said that there is "an anti-
Americanism and pro-Sovietism because
there is the feeling that the Reagan Adminis
tration has been sympathetic to the South
African government while the Soviet gov
ernment hasn't."
Lewis is currently a visiting scholar at the
African Studies Center at Columbia Univer
sity.
