## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Ensure integrity of gifts 
### 
Social psychology teaches us that humans exhibit a
strong compulsion to reciprocate for favors done or
gilts given. Last week University President Donald
Kennedy announced that William Hewlett had pledged
$50 million for the University's upcoming Centennial
campaign. We must ensure that our appreciation for
his gift does not translate into a debt of allegiance to
Hewlett's company, Hewlett-Packard.
Universities depend to a large extent on private con
tributions to fund, among other things, development
projects and student scholarships. Hewlett's donation
will undoubtedly prove beneficial to the Stanford com
munity. The $40 million earmarked for the "Near
West Campus" science and engineering commons will
cover 16 percent of total projected costs. The remain
ing money will be used to endow scholarships and fel
lowships for Stanford students. Kennedy said
Hewlett's contribution will "support purposes that are
essential to Stanford's mission." Hewlett certainly
deserves our gratitude.
However, we should not allow Hewlett's or any

other donor's contribution to affect University deci
sions, especially concerning such issues as divestment.
In a memo entitled "On Total Divestment," William
Massy, University vice president for Business and
Finance, wrote that if the University divested its funds
from corporations doing business in South Africa, the
"loss of donor goodwill would be substantial." Cur
rently, Stanford holds over $20 million worth of stock
in Hewlett-Packard, of which Hewlett is vice chairman.
The University's commitment to pursue a policy of
selective divestment must not be compromised by im
pressive contributions.
The administration constantly reasserts its desire to
maintain academic freedom at the University. We
should extend this principle to our acceptance of mon
etary donations. The University will always need the
support of private and corporate donors. While we
should be appreciative of contributions to University
projects, we should not conform our actions to the
desires of the donors.
