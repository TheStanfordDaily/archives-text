Arbitrary rulings
restrict candidates
As members of the Third
World/Progressive Alliance, we
would like to protest the handling of
this year's election by Jim McGrath,
the elections hearing commissioner.
We spent weeks developing The
People's Platform, a document in
tended to build an atmosphere of
respect for all peoples here at Stan
ford, in our community and through
out the world. Because we want the
1986-87 ASSU to be responsive to
our needs, we have been especially
careful not to disqualify the candi
dates for ASSU Senate who are run
ning to uphold the principles of The
People's Platform.
Since the end of last quarter, we
have continuously met with the mem
bers of the ASSU Elections Commit
tee to stay within the bylaws of the
elections handbook for our campaign
to promote The People's Platform,
and those candidates who have stated
their support for the platform. Jim
McGrath has made it especially diffi
cult for these candidates to campaign
by overturning his publicity decisions
after they accommodated them.
McGrath has been making arbitrary
interpretations of the bylaws specifi
cally against these candidates.
McGrath has treated the candi
dates who endorse our platform as a
slate regardless of the fact that they
have constantly insisted that they are
running as individuals. For example,
he has forced these candidates to
check that none of their fliers
"appear" (to him) similar in design.
He has also ridiculously stated that
the candidates cannot share certain
words (which he has defined as
"buzz" words), phrases, logos or even
the same color flier, despite the fact
that they all do agree with principles
of the platform. Would McGrath ask
that congressional candidates not run
under the principles of the U.S. Con
stitution?
We do feel that the just bylaws to

any election are necessary and ensure
a fair campaign. However, we do ob
ject to the fact that McGrath is forc
ing the candidates to waste time em
phasizing differences rather than al
lowing them to express their own
chosen principles for their own cam
paigns.

Send them love,
not military aid
As we debate what to do with the
contras. President Reagan proposes
to give them $100 million. He hopes
that if we can kill enough
Nicaraguans, then we'll win the
hearts and minds of those
Nicaraguans still living and thereby
topple the Sandinistas. Frankly, with
$100 million, 1 think we would win
their hearts and minds a lot quicker
with love.
Digging in the encyclopedia, I
found out that Nicaragua is smaller
than Minnesota and has fewer
people. Nicaragua has the same num
ber of people (three million) and is
the same size as lowa. Without cast
ing aspersions upon either Minne
sota or lowa — I used to live in Min
nesota and liked it very much — nei
ther Minnesota nor lowa (nor
Nicaragua) is very big. And three mil

lion people is not a lot of people.
Brooklyn has three million people. I
don't mean to cast aspersions on
Brooklyn, either, but as the world
goes, three million people is just not a
lot of people.
However, President Reagan thinks
the three million people of Nicaragua
are very important, and he wants to
kill some of them (I'm not clear as to
which ones) so that we'll win the
hearts and minds of the ones left
over.
Well ... this seems very risky to
me (if my neighbors got killed, I'd
have a hard time loving their killers).
If we want to win the hearts and
minds of the Nicaraguans, wouldn't it
be better to tell them that we really
care about them? After all, most of us
really open up to friendliness.
We could win their hearts and
minds by offering ourselves — as
tourists and volunteers. With $100
million, we could send over one
American for every 100 Nicaraguans
— 30,000 Americans at $3,000 each
would leave $10 million of the $100
million left over. The airlines could
fly each of us round trip to Nicaragua
for $200. (The airlines often have
deals where they'll fly round trip from
New York to San Francisco for $200,
and New York and San Francisco are
both about the same distance from
Nicaragua.) That leaves $2,800 for
each of us for spending money. In a
country where the annual per capita
income is $700, $2,800 could keep a
person winning hearts and minds for
a long time.
People already are going and
taking their tools with them so they
can help build the country. I'll bet
they'll win hearts and minds. Folks
are getting together to send tractors
and seeds. I'll bet they'll win hearts
and minds, too. We could bring our
copies of our Constitution and the
Declaration of Independence.
They've won hearts and minds
before, and I'm sure they can do it
again.

minds by offering ourselves — as
tourists and volunteers. With $100
million, we could send over one
American for every 100 Nicaraguans
— 30,000 Americans at $3,000 each
would leave $10 million of the $100
million left over. The airlines could
fly each of us round trip to Nicaragua
for $200. (The airlines often have
deals where they'll fly round trip from
New York to San Francisco for $200,
and New York and San Francisco are
both about the same distance from
Nicaragua.) That leaves $2,800 for
each of us for spending money. In a
country where the annual per capita
income is $700, $2,800 could keep a
person winning hearts and minds for
a long time.
People already are going and
taking their tools with them so they
can help build the country. I'll bet
they'll win hearts and minds. Folks
are getting together to send tractors
and seeds. I'll bet they'll win hearts
and minds, too. We could bring our
copies of our Constitution and the
Declaration of Independence.
They've won hearts and minds
before, and I'm sure they can do it
again.

As members of the Third
World/Progressive Alliance, we
would like to protest the handling of
this year's election by Jim McGrath,
the elections hearing commissioner.
We spent weeks developing The
People's Platform, a document in
tended to build an atmosphere of
respect for all peoples here at Stan
ford, in our community and through
out the world. Because we want the
1986-87 ASSU to be responsive to
our needs, we have been especially
careful not to disqualify the candi
dates for ASSU Senate who are run
ning to uphold the principles of The
People's Platform.
Since the end of last quarter, we
have continuously met with the mem
bers of the ASSU Elections Commit
tee to stay within the bylaws of the
elections handbook for our campaign
to promote The People's Platform,
and those candidates who have stated
their support for the platform. Jim
McGrath has made it especially diffi
cult for these candidates to campaign
by overturning his publicity decisions
after they accommodated them.
McGrath has been making arbitrary
interpretations of the bylaws specifi
cally against these candidates.
McGrath has treated the candi
dates who endorse our platform as a
slate regardless of the fact that they
have constantly insisted that they are
running as individuals. For example,
he has forced these candidates to
check that none of their fliers
"appear" (to him) similar in design.
He has also ridiculously stated that
the candidates cannot share certain
words (which he has defined as
"buzz" words), phrases, logos or even
the same color flier, despite the fact
that they all do agree with principles
of the platform. Would McGrath ask
that congressional candidates not run
under the principles of the U.S. Con
stitution?
We do feel that the just bylaws to

any election are necessary and ensure
a fair campaign. However, we do ob
ject to the fact that McGrath is forc
ing the candidates to waste time em
phasizing differences rather than al
lowing them to express their own
chosen principles for their own cam
paigns.

Send them love,
not military aid
As we debate what to do with the
contras. President Reagan proposes
to give them $100 million. He hopes
that if we can kill enough
Nicaraguans, then we'll win the
hearts and minds of those
Nicaraguans still living and thereby
topple the Sandinistas. Frankly, with
$100 million, 1 think we would win
their hearts and minds a lot quicker
with love.
Digging in the encyclopedia, I
found out that Nicaragua is smaller
than Minnesota and has fewer
people. Nicaragua has the same num
ber of people (three million) and is
the same size as lowa. Without cast
ing aspersions upon either Minne
sota or lowa — I used to live in Min
nesota and liked it very much — nei
ther Minnesota nor lowa (nor
Nicaragua) is very big. And three mil

lion people is not a lot of people.
Brooklyn has three million people. I
don't mean to cast aspersions on
Brooklyn, either, but as the world
goes, three million people is just not a
lot of people.
However, President Reagan thinks
the three million people of Nicaragua
are very important, and he wants to
kill some of them (I'm not clear as to
which ones) so that we'll win the
hearts and minds of the ones left
over.
Well ... this seems very risky to
me (if my neighbors got killed, I'd
have a hard time loving their killers).
If we want to win the hearts and
minds of the Nicaraguans, wouldn't it
be better to tell them that we really
care about them? After all, most of us
really open up to friendliness.
