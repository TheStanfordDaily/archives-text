## Theme houses offer cross-cultural learning 
### 
Now that Draw time is upon us, we want to
remind students about a very valuable residence
option — ethnic theme houses. While their value is
readily apparent to a great many people in this
community, we are writing to restate and to em
phasize again the commitment of the Office of Res
idential Education to support and promote these
vital and important houses.

Ethnic theme houses originated in the late 1960s
as the University was increasing its commitment to
support minority students, whose enrollment here
was growing for the first time in Stanford's history.
Over the years, ethnic theme houses have come to
include Ujamaa House in Lagiinita Court, the
black theme house: Casa Zapata in Stern Hall, the
Chicano theme house, and Okada House in Wilbur
Hall, the Asian-American theme house. In addi
tion, Roble Hall once served — and Robinson
House in Sterling Quad now serves — as the
residence to which Native American students are
offered priority for assignment and in which there
is special programming and academic support.
Priority for assignment to an ethnic theme house
is given to members of the particular ethnic group
for up to half of the spaces in the house. Histori
cally. 40 to 50 percent of residents of any given eth
nic theme house are members of the ethnic group
that is the focus of the house.
Ethnic theme houses represent one variation of
the diverse Stanford residential experience. They
share the goals of other dorms and houses — to be
both comfortable and intellectually stimulating
living environments. Their uniqueness, however.

derives from what they strive to do in addition to,
not instead of, what goes on in non-theme houses.
They provide a home in which cross-cultural edu
cation and the celebration of diversity are
promoted. This is done through the three major
goals for ethnic theme houses.
First, the houses provide an environment in
which sufficiently large numbers of students of the
same ethnic background may live together to avoid
the sense of isolation they might feel elsewhere on
campus. The houses can enable minority students
to live in a supportive, comfortable setting. This
can be especially important for students new to
Stanford, who are making the often difficult transi
tion from home and high school into the Univer
sity.

(Theme houses) provide
a home in which cross
cultural education and
the celebration of diver
sity are promoted . . .

Second, the houses provide an opportunity for all
students in the house to study, in a systematic way,
some aspects of an ethnic group that is represented
in the student body. Hence, social, cultural, educa
tional and recreational programs with an emphasis
on the group that is a focus of the house are part of

the house's activities. Students come to Stanford
with different degrees of exposure to this kind of
learning about their own or other ethnic groups.
Consequently, the educational opportunities of
fered in an ethnic theme house are valuable, in
vary ing ways, to all residents of the house.
Third, the houses provide an opportunity for stu
dents of different ethnic backgrounds to learn from
and about each other. This goal is accomplished in
part simply by living in the same residence with
others of different backgrounds and in part by
having programs that address both the theme of the
house and more general issues as well.
As with all student residences, the challenge is to
find the balance between the house as a comforta
ble. harmonious and supportive home and a place
where the intellect is stimulated, assumptions are
challenged and learning occurs. Zapata, Ujamaa,
Robinson and Okada meet this challenge well.
In addition to excellent programming, the day
to-day interaction in these houses offers the poten
tial for more substantive exchange and exploration
than exists in any other setting. Ethnic theme
houses offer experiences that are rich, rewarding
and enjoyable.
If you haven't visited lately, we hope you will
soon. The perfect opportunity is presented in the
Draw open houses which begin April 14. At
Okada, Ujamaa, Zapata and Robinson, staff and
residents alike will be delighted to welcome you
and tell you everything you want to know about
what life in the house is really like.
