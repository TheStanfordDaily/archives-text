# Fear and loathing in Nicaragua
## 
### 
Writing about Richard Nixon in the early 19705,
Hunter S. Thompson said that Nixon represented "that
dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American
character almost every other country in the world has
learned to fear and despise." Perhaps a better candidate
would have been William Walker, who invaded Nicaragua
in 1855 in order to pursue business interests there, and to
foster democracy. He was motivated in part by greed, in
part by ideology; but his story, at bottom, is not about
anything as messy as morality or as political as im
perialism. It is a story of a mans failure to acknowledge
the existence of things greater than himself, a disease that
corrupted his ideals, blinded him to the wrongfulness of
his acts, and eventually killed him. It was a disease en
demic to his country.

In 1848, gold was discovered in California. American
businessmen wanted a quick way to get from the East
Coast of the United States to the West Coast. A perfect
shortcut, naturally, was through the Central American
isthmus, across the southern part of Nicaragua. Sensing a
commercial goldmine, the United States began to
shoulder Britain out of Latin America. The British were
fighting the Crimean War at the time, couldn't handle the
tension on two fronts and grudgingly bowed out.
One particularly revolting historical nugget concerns an
additional reason for U.S. interest in the region: Central
America had abolished slavery in 1821, but pro-slavery
forces in the United States saw Central America as the
perfect opportunity to add new slave states to the union.
Governments in the region were weak, and with very little
trouble, a few divisions of well-trained troops could
topple the existing regimes and set up slave states allied
with the United States. This plan, plus the desire for quick
access between coasts, increased American presence in
Nicaragua.
Two political factions were at war in Nicaragua, the
Liberal and the Conservatives. Each side, in addition to
wanting foreign aid for a canal, wanted help in defeating
its opposing party. In 1849, American shipping magnate
Cornelius Vanderbilt struck a deal with the Conservatives
to build a transit route across the isthmus. Vanderbilt's
route did so well that within a few years his California
manager, a man named Garrison, set out to double-cross
him by taking over the company. Garrison enlisted the
help of a rich New York financier, and promised military
aid to the Nicaraguan Liberals, who were fighting the
Conservatives (with whom Vanderbilt was allied) in
return for Nicaraguan land. The Liberals agreed. All Gar
rison needed now was someone to walk point into
Nicaragua. Enter William Walker.
Originally from Tennessee, Walker had not only ob
tained degrees in both law and medicine before coming to

California, but had also edited an anti-slavery newspaper.
He was intelligent, educated and idealistic, but neverthe
less somehow wedded to the notion of America's manifest
destiny to expand its territories. He hooked up with Gar
rison in 1855, and that summer, with an army of 57 men,
William Walker invaded Nicaragua.
Walker's first attack was repulsed, but on his second at
tempt, he defeated the Conservative forces and took over
the country. Walker solidified his power base with money,
arms and troops from Garrison, and from American
Southerners eager to help with the annexation of the new
slave territory. In order to obtain the support of this latter
group, Walker renounced his former abolitionism, and
apparently modified his views on the value of human life,
as he began executing or exiling his Conservative oppo
nents.
Things began to darken for Walker in early 1856. The
conservative governments of Guatemala, Honduras,
Costa Rica and El Salvador began sending arms and
troops to help liberate Nicaragua from Walker's regime;
and when Costa Rica actually declared out-and-out war
on Walker in March of that year, Great Britain, still angry
at being kicked out of the region by the United States,
sent additional military aid to be used against Walker's
forces.
Under the pressure of the war, Walker became a
paranoid, ruthless dictator, alienating even his Liberal
allies. In a frantic effort to retain his power, Walker had
himself "elected" president of the region, declared En
glish the official language, enacted laws to ensure forced
peasant labor for landowners, legalized slavery and of
fered land grants to anyone willing to join his army. All
this from a man who, scarcely two years earlier, had set
foot in the country for the first time.
Walker was eventually defeated, and he and his army
escaped under U.S. protection. Yet within the next three
years, Walker staged three more attempts to retake the
country. In 1860, he was captured in Honduras by British
marines. The British, slow to forget an injury, turned him
over to the Hondurans, who quickly tried Walker and
killed him.
Walker's exploits seem distant today, but his attitude
persists. If the United States has a dark side, or merely a
national chronic blindness, I submit that it is this attitude
that we have the right, perhaps even the duty, to remake
the world in our own image, to dismiss as invalid the
wishes of those we want to change and to take advantage
of those who are simply too small to hit back. Walker was
offered a chance that would tempt many Americans
today: the chance not only to make-a fortune, but to
spread democracy to another country and to help make
them free ... or at least more American. Walker's in
ability to understand an alien culture and his failure to
grasp his own limitations reminds one of Joseph Conrad,
one of the keenest observers of imperialism, both commer
cial and cognitive, who wrote: "I've seen the devil of vio
lence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire; hut
by all the stars, these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils that
swayed and drove men. . . . But as 1 stood on that hillside, 1
foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land, 1 would
become acquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed
devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly."
