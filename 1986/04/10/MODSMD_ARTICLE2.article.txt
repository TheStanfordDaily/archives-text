# Chemical probe continues, decision soon
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
An investigator for the Santa Clara County dis
trict attorney said his office will decide by the end
of the month whether to file charges against the
University for incidents involving chemicals and
hazardous wastes in Stanford laboratories.
Deputy District Attorney Jerry Nadler said he is
examining the minor explosion that occurred last
month in the Stauffer 111 Physical Chemistiy build
ing as well as the history of hazardous material and
waste incidents at the University to determine if
there exist "patterns that would establish viola
tions" of health and safety regulations.
Nadler said if his probe reveals any violations of
the health and safety regulations by the University,
the District Attorney's Office could "decide to file
either a criminal or civil complaint against Stan
ford." The District Attorney's Office would also
have to determine whether responsibility was indi
vidual or corporate, Nadler said.
Following a meeting between with officials from
Stanford and the District Attorney's Office last
month, Palo Alto Fire Chief Robert Wall told The
Daily that the University "is moving toward full
compliance with safety laws in its underground
facilities but that there is still a great deal of work
to be done in the above-ground areas.
Wall blames the health and safety ordinance it
self for the University's non-compliance. "The
volume of material and data necessary to make
available (for evaluation) made it difficult to be in
compliance by the deadline" in February, Wall
said.

According to Wall, however, Stanford has made
progress in conforming to county health and safety
regulations.
At question is the University's compliance with
both the Santa Clara County Hazardous Materials
Ordinance, which deals with the storage of danger
ous chemicals, and the state fire code, according to
Nadler. The District Attorney's Office initiated the
investigation at the request of the Palo Alto Fire
Department, he said.
Since the ordinance is intended to cover the
storage of larger amounts of chemicals rather than
the smaller quantities used in laboratories, Nadler
said he is "focusing on violations of the fire code."
The University may have violated the fire code
through the improper handling of flammable ma
terials, he said.
Each fire code violation carries up to a $1,000
maximum fine. A six-month jail sentence could also
be imposed on responsible individuals, according to
Nadler.
Although he would not state whether the Uni
versity had violated any health and safety regula
tions, Nadler said "while we are reviewing viola
tions that have been demonstrated in the past,
questions regarding those incidents might have
been resolved through closer cooperation between
the Stanford laboratories and the Palo Alto Fire
Department."
In order to deal more effectively with chemical
related emergencies, Alain Decleve, director of
University Health and Safety, said he hopes to
develop a "new culture" about chemical safety.
Beginning in May, for example, a new training pro
gram will attempt to "train the trainer," whereby

department officials will he taught to educate their
own personnel on proper procedures and precau
tions, Decleve said.
In an effort to provide easily accessible emer
gency information. Decleve's office has installed in
many labs metal containers that indicate on the
outside what hazards are present in a laboratory.
The boxes co> ain lists of specific hazardous ma
terials and names of people familiar with the labo
ratory to contact in an emergency. After the
meeting in March. Wall called the invention of
these "life safety boxes" very encouraging.
Under Decleve, the Health and Safety Office has
organized its own emergency response team to deal
with chemical spills. "We are a specialized group,"
said Jon Moldestad, the head of the team. "We find
out the problem and clean it up." he said.
Moldestad said a "rash of accidents" during the
period leading up to the District Attorney's investi
gation led to an "unusually high" number of calls to
the Palo Alto Fire Department.
Moldestad and Decleve both stressed that safety
conditions at the University were improving, but
the process would take time.
"Sure we're going to improve. We're already
ahead of the game. But, we're pot interested in a
game. We're interested in improving safety at Stan
ford," Decleve said.
Health and Safety is compiling a detailed inven
toiy of the location and quantities of chemicals
stored on campus, according to Decleve. "In each
lab. there are lots of chemicals. The first step
(toward improved safety) is to identify where the
