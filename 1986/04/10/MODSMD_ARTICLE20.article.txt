## 'Flaubert's Parrot' presents an original imitation 
### JONATHAN TREITEL 
"Flaubert's Parrot"
By Julian Barnes
McGraw Hill, $4.95

Melt down all the statues to make coins! Use
the canvas of all the pictures to make clothes!
Heat your room with the frames!
In 1840, a teenager called Gustave
Flaubert jotted this manifesto in his
notebook. He was later to become a dedi
cated novelist; yet he never renounced his
youthful anarchism. How did he reconcile his
anti-art polemic with a devotion to pernickety
craftsmanship?
All French schoolchildren are taught that
their language derives from Latin. They are
encouraged to write their essays in long
winded Latinate style. When those children
are let loose in the playground, they yell
mock-Latin nonsense chants. This queer
closeness of high-flown rhetoric to silly
twaddle is at the root of the French sensibility.
At his best, Flaubert walked the line between
realism and absurdism.
Take Flaubert's short story "Un Coeur
Simple" ("A Simple Soul"). It is about a poor
woman named Felicite who suffers one mis
fortune after another until she is left with
nothing but her parrot Loulou. Finally Loulou
drops dead, and Felicite has it
stuffed. When Felicite herself is on her
deathbed, she has a vision of the Holy Ghost
hovering over her in the form of a stuffed
parrot.
Should we laugh or cry? Flaubert manages

to write the story so it is both a tear-jerker
and a thigh-slapper. It would be next to
impossible to write this story in English, be
cause we Anglophones have two quite sepa
rate registers and vocabularies: a Latinate one
for the serious sententious stuff and a Ger
manic one for the comic bits.
The British writer Julian Barnes has pub
lished a meta-novel called "Flaubert's Par-

rot" which imitates Flaubert's blend of absur
dism and tragedy. Geoffrey Braithwaite, an
English doctor and amateur Flaubert fan,
whose beloved wife has just died, visits
France in quest of a stuffed parrot. He is con
vinced that Flaubert owned a parrot on which
he modeled Loulou, and he hopes to assuage
the misery of his bereavement by searching
for this bird. Most of the book consists of
Braithwaite's cranky analysis of Flaubert's

life and writings. Barnes is conducting a
literary criticism of literary criticism. Just as
comparative literature merely spawns more
comparative literature, but cannot itself be a
work of art, so Braithwaite discovers scores of
stuffed parrots but cannot resurrect his wife.
And yet, this book does recycle literary
criticism into Fiction. The meta-novel eats its
own tail.

The book is skillful and amusing. There is a
chapter on animals in Flaubert's fiction and
life, another chapter on the symbolism of rail
ways. There is a fake examination page on
Flaubert. There is a chronology of his bon
mots, ripped out of context. And all these are
written in the half-crazed, humorous
melancholy tone of Braithwaite.
Great thinkers throughout the ages — from
Aristotle to Dr. Doolittle — have argued that

the parrot possesses a kind of humanity by
virtue of its ability to imitate human speech.
But this is the minority view: most people go
along with Webster's Dictionary, which
defines the verb "parrot" as: "to imitate the
form without understanding the sense."
Surely originality is the mark of genuinely
human thought, and indeed of true art? Nor
necessarily so. According to a long-standing

Do not imagine that art is
something that is designed to give
gentle uplift and self-confidence.
Art is not a brassiere.

tradition in France, aphoristic truth can be
obtained from cliches. Indeed, the word cliche
comes from the French: it originally meant a
block of type containing a common phrase
that was kept permanently set up.
The 17th century French philosopher Pere
Bouhours criticized a neologism: "These
words must be greatly surprised to Find them
selves together; for assuredly they had never
met before." For the French, formalized rhet

oric is the height of eloquence; nevertheless it
merges imperceptibly into boring jargon, so
there is a dialectic uniting Dr. Doolittle and
Noah Webster.
The eponymous heroes of Flaubert's last,
unfinished novel, "Bouvard et Pecuchet," were
a pair of copyists who jotted down a diction
ary of cliches for their own (and Flaubert's)
use. Like Braithwaite, they were "artists" of a
very limited kind. In their dictionary, they
defined artists as "all charlatans," and claim
"what artists do cannot be called work." Fur
thermore, they criticized the novel, saying it
"corrupts the masses; only historical novels
should be allowed because they teach his
tory." Is there a kind of truth that can be ex
pressed in cliches? Is original art a mirage?
Braithwaite cannot make his mind up. He
tries to escape from the misery into Flauber
tolatry; then, disgusted by fictitiousness, he
returns to his own sadness.
What, ultimately, is the use of art? Barnes
(or Braithwaite) writes: "Do not imagine that
Art is something which is designed to give
gentle uplift and self-confidence. Art is not a
brassiere. At least, not in the English sense.
But do not forget that brassiere in the French
is a life-jacket."
Barnes has managed to write a meta-novel
that is at the same time jokey and deadly
serious. It's possible to read it as a mere exer
cise in the production of literature out of un
promising materials; to cite one of Flaubert's
metaphors: "People used to think sugar came
just from the sugarcane: now they make it
from almost anything." But it is also a moving
meditiation on the use or uselessness of art.

obtained from cliches. Indeed, the word cliche
comes from the French: it originally meant a
block of type containing a common phrase

very limited kind. In their dictionary, they
defined artists as "all charlatans," and claim
"what artists do cannot be called work." Fur

Barnes has managed to write a meta-novel

serious. It's possible to read it as a mere exer

promising materials; to cite one of Flaubert's
metaphors: "People used to think sugar came
just from the sugarcane: now they make it
from almost anything." But it is also a moving
meditiation on the use or uselessness of art.

"Flaubert's Parrot"
By Julian Barnes
McGraw Hill, $4.95

Melt down all the statues to make coins! Use
the canvas of all the pictures to make clothes!
Heat your room with the frames!
In 1840, a teenager called Gustave
Flaubert jotted this manifesto in his
notebook. He was later to become a dedi
cated novelist; yet he never renounced his
youthful anarchism. How did he reconcile his
anti-art polemic with a devotion to pernickety
craftsmanship?
All French schoolchildren are taught that
their language derives from Latin. They are
encouraged to write their essays in long
winded Latinate style. When those children
are let loose in the playground, they yell
mock-Latin nonsense chants. This queer
closeness of high-flown rhetoric to silly
twaddle is at the root of the French sensibility.
At his best, Flaubert walked the line between
realism and absurdism.
Take Flaubert's short story "Un Coeur
Simple" ("A Simple Soul"). It is about a poor
woman named Felicite who suffers one mis
fortune after another until she is left with
nothing but her parrot Loulou. Finally Loulou
drops dead, and Felicite has it
stuffed. When Felicite herself is on her
deathbed, she has a vision of the Holy Ghost
hovering over her in the form of a stuffed
parrot.
Should we laugh or cry? Flaubert manages

to write the story so it is both a tear-jerker
and a thigh-slapper. It would be next to
impossible to write this story in English, be
cause we Anglophones have two quite sepa
rate registers and vocabularies: a Latinate one
for the serious sententious stuff and a Ger
manic one for the comic bits.
The British writer Julian Barnes has pub
lished a meta-novel called "Flaubert's Par-

rot" which imitates Flaubert's blend of absur
dism and tragedy. Geoffrey Braithwaite, an
English doctor and amateur Flaubert fan,
whose beloved wife has just died, visits
France in quest of a stuffed parrot. He is con
vinced that Flaubert owned a parrot on which
he modeled Loulou, and he hopes to assuage
the misery of his bereavement by searching
for this bird. Most of the book consists of
Braithwaite's cranky analysis of Flaubert's

life and writings. Barnes is conducting a
literary criticism of literary criticism. Just as
comparative literature merely spawns more
comparative literature, but cannot itself be a
work of art, so Braithwaite discovers scores of
stuffed parrots but cannot resurrect his wife.
And yet, this book does recycle literary
criticism into Fiction. The meta-novel eats its
own tail.

The book is skillful and amusing. There is a
chapter on animals in Flaubert's fiction and
life, another chapter on the symbolism of rail
ways. There is a fake examination page on
Flaubert. There is a chronology of his bon
mots, ripped out of context. And all these are
written in the half-crazed, humorous
melancholy tone of Braithwaite.

Aristotle to Dr. Doolittle — have argued that
