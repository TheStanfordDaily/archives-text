## Cooder rocks, but director Hill veers through 'Crossroads' 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
On the lace of it, "Crossroads"
would seem to he the perfect vehicle
for director Walter Hill. It's a buddy
picture, like "48 Hrs.," with the odys
sey through hostile territory of "The
Warriors" and "Southern Comfort."
Like "Southern Comfort,"
"Crossroads" is backed by a great Ry
Cooder score, which is even more in
tegral to this story than his haunting
Cajun ballads were to the earlier film.
Music has always been an exciting
element in Walter Hill movies. Here
it's more important than the actors
and their dialogue.
John Fusco's screenplay unites
classical guitar prodigy Eugene
Moscone ( Ralph Macchio) and aging
bluesman Willie Brown (Joe Seneca)
in New York, where Willie is wasting
away in a nursing home after being
imprisoned for shooting a fellow
bluesman. Willie is a cantankerous
old coot, famous for his blues har
monica. He's contemptuous of
Eugene's efforts at blues guitar, but
agrees to teach Eugene the fabled,
unrecorded 30th song of the leg
endary bluesman Robert Johnson if
Eugene helps him escape back to the
Mississippi Delta. It was there, at the
Fulton's Point crossroads, that Willie
signed his soul over to the devil so
that he could become a great blues

man.
Fusco's screenplay is not a
model of characterization or pacing.
The early scenes in the nui>ing home
drag on without telling us anything
new about the characters, as does a
scene in a bus terminal and some of
the episodes with Willie and Eugene
on the open road.
Even more depressing is
Hill's inability to structure or direct
these scenes in any interesting way.
"The Warriors. "The Long Riders"
and "Southern Comfort" were
movies Hill clearly cared about,
movies in which he established his
reputation as our most erratically
brilliant action director. Even "48
His." was a beautiful hack job, di
rected with such energy and convic
tion it carried us right over the in
anities in the script.
But "Crossroads" continues Hill's
directing slump, which began with
"Streets of Fire" and "Brewster's
Millions.' He can't whip up even a
professional enthusiasm for these
movies; they dribble along, the bare
bones of their tired plots sticking out
all over.
Scenes in "Crossroads'" just fizzle
out. The characters steal a car from a
ruthless pimp, or are harrassed by
crooked Southern cops (who, in a
nice twist, are black), and nothing
ever comes of it: Willie and Eugene
simply move on to the next pseudo

obstacle in their journey. There are
no payoffs or buildups to these
episodes, so we get a disjointed cata
log of Southern perils, barely held to
gether by Cooder's terrific selection
of music. It's easy to see why Hill
might take on this project, but while
filming he may have become ultra
conscious that he was repeating him
self in many scenes, and lost all con
viction.

The film has a bar episode that
begins as a direct take-off of the one
in "48 Hrs." The scene is ready to ex
plode into a rousing, free-for-all light
when suddenly, incredibly, the
bartender breaks it up with a lecture
on how senseless bar fights are.
That's a disastrous first in a Walter
Hill movie, and is typical of the rest of
the film.
Even it all the elements in this mu

sical journey seemed right, we may
balk at Fusco's putting yet another
teenager at the center of his odysse>.
Casting Ralph Macchio was a hig
mistake: this young actor was drippy
and petulant in 1984's "The Karate
Kid." and he apparently struck a
nerve with teenagers. Here Macchio
seems intensely aware that this movie
is his hig chance at an adult audience,
and he comes across as earnestly
drippy and petulant. His character is
in love with the blues, but there's
nothing laid back oi rhythmic about
Macchio's performance.
He's deadly serious about acting
every scene is a chore â€” and
whatever charisma he might have had
is demolished by his misplaced inten
sity (he's like a young Michael
Douglas). His Eugene is so polity and
cocky that Willie's initial contempt
for him seems appropriate: when this
contempt gradually turns to respect,
it's inexplicable. Eugene can play a
mean guitar (and Macchio does an
admirable job plucking to match the
music), but that's literally all he has
going for him.
Macchio is a sop to the terrify ingly
important teen audience, and so is his
character's romance with Frances
(Jami Gertz), a streetwise runaway
heading for Los Angeles. Gertz is a
credible young actress, but not even
she can convince us that Frances
would fall for wet-behind-the-ears

Kugene. This i> the same problem
Seneca laces, though he triumphs by
a virtuoso display of wily charisma.
Willie wouldn't be much of a charac
ter if he didn't have Seneca's acrid
edge honed by experience. His grudg
ing respect tor Kugene is never more
than that, even when the script has
Willie actually caring about Kugene's
emotional development. (We don't.)
I he most notable exception to the
overall limpness of the individual
scenes in "Crossroads" is the ending.
Willie and Kugene (who has now . we
are told, "lived the blues." and so can
really play them) return to the cross
roads. where they confront the devil.
Scratch (Robert Judd). He stages a
musical showdown between his
demon guitarist. Jack Butler (Steve
Vai. of the rock group Alcatrazz) and
Kugene. It's a true knockout. Set in a
loadhouse in hell. Butler and Kugene
square off in a musical duel that
blows away our memory of most of
the movie. They burn through a
heavy metal, blues and classical guitar
fusion arranged and performed by
Vai and Cooder s that makes us even
more aware of what's l ight and wrong
with "Crossroads."'
Hill and Fusco know what they're
doing when it comes to the music and
blues mythos, but they can't construct
an even halfway credible or
memorable road picture to hold these
elements together.


Ralph Macchio traded in his karate gear f or a blues guitar in his cur
rent film "Crossroads," directed by Walter Hill.
