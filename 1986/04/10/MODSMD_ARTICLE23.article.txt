## Teammates look to unbeaten McEnroe 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Patrick McEnroe has arrived.
After a shaky 3-4 start at the No. 6 singles
spot as a freshman, the sophomore from New
York City has steamrolled to 31 wins out of his
last 32 singles matches dating back to last
season.
McEnroe has moved up to No. 3 singles this
season and currently sports a perfect 13-0
record, the best on the team.
"Right now he is probably playing the best
tennis on the team," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said.
With several players on the squad struggling
right now, McEnroe's play has been invaluable
to the Cardinal's success thus far.
"He is an encouragement for everybody
else," teammate Mark Jacobson said. "He has
provided a good point of stability for the team,
especially when the team isn't playing very
well."
Although his performances have been out
standing, McEnroe emphasizes the team aspect
of college tennis.
"I am not entirely thrilled about winning
when the team doesn't win," he said.
McEnroe entered Stanford with top billing in
1984, as the No. 13 junior in the nation and the
younger brother of professional great John
McEnroe. He has disappointed no one since he
has continually improved during his stay on the
Farm.
He ended last year at the No. 4 slot with a 21 -
5 record in singles play. McEnroe's steady rise
to the top in collegiate tennis prompted a pre
season ranking this year of 49th according to
the Head Intercollegiate Tennis Standings. He

moved up as high as No. 43 on the singles list,
but despite his unblemished record, McEnroe
dropped to No. 44 in the most recent poll.
McEnroe's ascent to the elite corps of col
legiate tennis was not an easy one. however.
The transition from high school and junior com
petition was rough going in the beginning.
"It took a while to adapt," McEnroe said.
Currently, McEnroe has done more than just
adapt. He has excelled, gaining the respect and
admiration of his teammates and his coach.
"He leads by example," teammate Scott
Moody said. "He is tenacious and is fighting in
every match."
"You can't just talk about tennis when you
talk about Patrick," Gould said. "He is ex
tremely coachable, he is a team leader and he
sets a great example on and off the court. He is
just a fine young man."
McEnroe has rarely been tested this season.
He demolished highly regarded Tim Pawsat of
USC over the weekend 6-1, 6-3.
McEnroe competes in doubles with Letts.
The pair has suffered its ups and downs this
season, with an 8-3 record. The combination is
a respected one, however, as its pre-season
ranking was No. 13 in the nation.
"We are just going to get better; we are get
ting used to playing with each other," McEnroe
said.
The best facet of McEnroe's game is his over
powering two-handed backhand.
"He has one of the greatest two-handed
backhands I have ever seen," Gould said.
After last season, McEnroe's weaknesses
were labeled as his forehand and serve. Since

has also compiled an 8-3 record in doubles play with partner
John Letts. McEnroe is currently the No. 44 ranked singles
player although he started the year ranked 43rd.

Patrick McEnroe got off to a rocky start as a freshman, losing
four of his first seven matches, but has since been red-hot,
winning 31 of his last 32 matches and all 13 this season. He
then, he has improved his forehand
tremendously, contributing to this
year's success.
"Now they (the players) are
playing his forehand, and he is killing
them with it," Gould said.

"1 get more confident after each
match that I play," McEnroe said.
Last summer, McEnroe tested his
abilities by playing in some profes
sional tournaments. He had some
successes but did not feel on a par
with the pros yet.
"I played well but I was a small
level below the other guys,"
McEnroe said.
In the future, McEnroe may join

his brother John to play professional
doubles together.
"1 think it's a good possibility in a
couple of years," McEnroe said of the
merger.
Like any great athlete, McEnroe is
not yet satisfied with his level of play.
"I still have a lot of improving to
do," he said. "It's no time to stop
now."

then, he has improved his forehand
tremendously, contributing to this
year's success.
"Now they (the players) are
playing his forehand, and he is killing
them with it," Gould said.

"1 get more confident after each
match that I play," McEnroe said.
Last summer, McEnroe tested his
abilities by playing in some profes
sional tournaments. He had some
successes but did not feel on a par
with the pros yet.
"I played well but I was a small
level below the other guys,"
McEnroe said.
In the future, McEnroe may join

his brother John to play professional
doubles together.
"1 think it's a good possibility in a
couple of years," McEnroe said of the
merger.
Like any great athlete, McEnroe is
not yet satisfied with his level of play.
"I still have a lot of improving to
do," he said. "It's no time to stop
now."
Patrick McEnroe has arrived.
After a shaky 3-4 start at the No. 6 singles
spot as a freshman, the sophomore from New
York City has steamrolled to 31 wins out of his
last 32 singles matches dating back to last
season.
McEnroe has moved up to No. 3 singles this
season and currently sports a perfect 13-0
record, the best on the team.
"Right now he is probably playing the best
tennis on the team," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said.
With several players on the squad struggling
right now, McEnroe's play has been invaluable
to the Cardinal's success thus far.
"He is an encouragement for everybody
else," teammate Mark Jacobson said. "He has
provided a good point of stability for the team,
especially when the team isn't playing very
well."
Although his performances have been out
standing, McEnroe emphasizes the team aspect
of college tennis.
"I am not entirely thrilled about winning
when the team doesn't win," he said.
McEnroe entered Stanford with top billing in
1984, as the No. 13 junior in the nation and the
younger brother of professional great John
McEnroe. He has disappointed no one since he
has continually improved during his stay on the
Farm.
He ended last year at the No. 4 slot with a 21 -
5 record in singles play. McEnroe's steady rise
to the top in collegiate tennis prompted a pre
season ranking this year of 49th according to
the Head Intercollegiate Tennis Standings. He

moved up as high as No. 43 on the singles list,
but despite his unblemished record, McEnroe
dropped to No. 44 in the most recent poll.
McEnroe's ascent to the elite corps of col
legiate tennis was not an easy one. however.
The transition from high school and junior com
petition was rough going in the beginning.
"It took a while to adapt," McEnroe said.
Currently, McEnroe has done more than just
adapt. He has excelled, gaining the respect and
admiration of his teammates and his coach.
"He leads by example," teammate Scott
Moody said. "He is tenacious and is fighting in
every match."
"You can't just talk about tennis when you
talk about Patrick," Gould said. "He is ex
tremely coachable, he is a team leader and he
sets a great example on and off the court. He is
just a fine young man."
McEnroe has rarely been tested this season.
He demolished highly regarded Tim Pawsat of
USC over the weekend 6-1, 6-3.
McEnroe competes in doubles with Letts.
The pair has suffered its ups and downs this
season, with an 8-3 record. The combination is
a respected one, however, as its pre-season
ranking was No. 13 in the nation.
"We are just going to get better; we are get
ting used to playing with each other," McEnroe
said.
The best facet of McEnroe's game is his over
powering two-handed backhand.
"He has one of the greatest two-handed
backhands I have ever seen," Gould said.
After last season, McEnroe's weaknesses
were labeled as his forehand and serve. Since

has also compiled an 8-3 record in doubles play with partner
John Letts. McEnroe is currently the No. 44 ranked singles
player although he started the year ranked 43rd.

four of his first seven matches, but has since been red-hot,
winning 31 of his last 32 matches and all 13 this season. He
