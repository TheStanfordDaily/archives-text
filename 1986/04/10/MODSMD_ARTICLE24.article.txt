# Look out for TV trash sports season
## 
### 
It awaits us all. It lurks behind the shadows
of professional baseball, ready and poised to
inflict suffering upon many a sports fan.
In the 19405, Albert Camus might have
called it the plague. Today we refer to it as the
junk sports syndrome — a condition that of
tentimes exceeds the medical backlashes of
watching the Skipper hit Gilligan.
This awful and sometimes fatal sports ill
ness usually goes into remission during the
winter months as the Gretskys and Jabbars
admirably serve as athletic antibodies.
But they grow weary, ultimately relinquish
ing their vigil to the open arms of baseball.
Professional baseball works at first.
Opening day crowds, the Giants in first place,
Ronald Reagan tossing a pitch or three — all
this and more (not including the six-in-one
kitchen knife) help to keep the ailment at bay.
Gradually though, the rosy fingers of
baseball afternoons will crumble and fall prey
to the dreaded junk sports syndrome, dare I
say it twice.
Slowly, ever so slowly, like the finesse and
subtlety of a well-played roller derby match,
the strangling, prehensile hands of Curt
Gowdy, Tom Selleck, Brooke Shields, Rowdy
Roddy Piper, Minnesota Fats, Nolan Crom
well and other athletic and nonathletic
parasites will clutch our throats, and in true
"Clockwork Orange" fashion, they will force

us poor droogies to watch their sporting hor
ror.
Strapped to our chairs, eyes dilated, we will
listen to Mr. Gowdy, our able narrator, in
form us of our list of junk sport selections
while Brooke and Rowdy Roddy cackle in the
background.
We perspire, not only due to the thought of
what will come before us, but also because
we've hit baseball mid-season and our list of
sports options has been dismally limited. We
are no longer immune.
As expected, the first show Mr. Gowdy
selects is his own — "The American
Sportsman." "Reel 'er in there. Bob. That'a
wav. Sure looks like a beauty. Hey, let's head
over by those reeds and try some trolling,
okay Bob?" So ends the eloquent fishing
soliloquy of Mr. Gowdy, our American
Sportsman.
Keeping with his namesake, Gowdy
switches the channel. Suddenly, Tom Selleck
is bumping a volleyball. Mercy, it's the
"Battle of the Network Stars." Please, give us
more eyedrops and throw in some sedatives if
available.
Soon, like hypnotized sea urchins, we find
ourselves cheering for the "Love Boat" team,
hoping for a first-place finish in the touch
football competition.
"Had enough?" Mr. Gowdy inquires. We

have, but he is a cruel man. After exposing us
to the regular Superstars, the one which Los
Angeles Rams free saftey Nolan Cromwell al
ways participates in, the "Meisterbrau
Bowling Open" — sponsored by True Value

hardware stores — then confronts us.
We eagerly watch, listening intently to the
hushed whispers of Chris Schenkel, as Mark
Anthony converts that "crucial spare." Next,
Earl Anthony, in a comeback attempt, toes
the line and promptly scores a strike. The
excitement is unbearable.
Fortunately, a tender side of Mr. Gowdy
goads him to turn the channel, this time bring
ing us the "NFL Cheerleading Champion
ships."
We blink spasmodically, unable to contain
our unmitigated joy. The disease has now hit
with full force — we begin to enjoy the whole
junk sport genre. Where is Gretzky? When

will baseball begin its playoffs?
The onslaught only continues to the tune of
billiards. Though admittedly somewhat enter
taining, billiards (such a sophisticated title)
still possesses the disease qualifications,
namely in the form of Minnesota Fats. An
oversize cue ball. Fats wows us with his ath
letic prowess, and most surprisingly, he often
misses.
From pool, we turn to wrist-wrestling. At
this point, the casualties are rising; others are
at critical stages, evident by their wild,
repeated chantings of "We want the Circus of
the Stars."
Mr. Gowdy scoffs and adjusts the color for
our next show — NBC Sportsworld's segment
of "Survival of the Fittest." Oh how we howl
with delight. Grown men stomping through
wild terrain, bravely pitting their fortitude
against the best that Mother Nature can offer.
See them dangle precariously over rushing
rapids. Hear them make determined and
primitive noises.
When Mr. Gowdy makes his move toward
the TV, we shout our displeasure and try to
struggle free to stop him. Quickly, recognizing
the mutiny, Brooke and Rowdy Roddy
restrain us.
Before long, it is the "NFL Strongest Man
Competition." Huge men lug refrigerators on
their backs, which meets with frenzied ap

proval from the live audience standing
nearby. Later, these same very strong men
pull pickup trucks. Good fun is had by all.
Most of us by now are either comatose or in
the latter stages of rigor mortis. For those sur
viving few, Mr. Gowdy gives us professional
wrestling.
Rowdy Roddy, who stood beside us all
along, has a serene smile on his face. He is in
his element, spiritually, physically and
literally. The match featured our friend
Rowdy Roddy Piper against King Kong
Bundy. It is like a ballet on cement. A
turnbuckle treatment here, a little groin
kicking there.
I look around and notice that 1 am the only
one left. I know that I cannot last long. Mr.
Gowdy reaches for the switch once more,
nods to Brooke, and suddenly, "The Circus of
the Network Stars" appears on the screen.
I love every second of the show — my
minutes are obviously numbered.
But wait, by some great celestial act of
Peter Ueberroth, the baseball playoffs arrive.
Mr. Gowdy immediately starts shrinking into
a tackle box while Brooke metamorphoses
into a pair of Underoos. Rowdy Roddy is
nowhere to be seen.
I am saved. And for the final coup lie grace,
the Giants eventually win the World Series
over the Minnesota Twins.
