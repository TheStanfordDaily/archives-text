### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
A six-day road trip ended with a loss last night, as
UCLA downed the Stanford men's volleyball team
7-15, 15-10, 15-9, 15-13. The Cardinal split the
four-match southern series and now has a 10-7
record in the California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association, good for fifth place.
Stanford is ranked eighth in the country. UCLA,
tied at No. 3 in the nation with Penn State, is third
in the league with an 11-5 mark.
Outside hitter Chris Braun topped Stanford with
29 kills and a .302 hitting average. Senior Jon Root
recorded 23 kills but hit only .059. Scoot Fortune
scored 12 kills and had a .250 percentage.
Junior Jeff Williams led the Bruins with 21 kills.
UCLA outhit Stanford .238 to . 191.
That was mostly the result of UCLA's blocking,
which nullified the Cardinal offense much of the
evening. "The UCLA block was really effective,
Stanford's Dave Johnson said.
"UCLA had a good block," senior All-American
candidate Braun said. "They took a little off out
hitting and blocked some key balls."'
Continuing injury problems with Ail-American
Root have also hurt the Cardinal. The outside hitter
re-sprained an ankle during practice last week and
is now experiencing difficulty with his shoulder and
back. "The whole game was my fault," Root
said." My shoulder was so bad. it felt like spaghetti.
"This is the worst I've ever played."' Root contin
ued."and I'm feeling the worst I've ever felt. I'm
playing at about 80 percent. It's frustrating. It
seems like there's something missing.'"
Stanford jumped out to an early lead in the
match, winning the first game. "We played our
game," freshman Johnson said, "then we let up the
second game. UCLA scored some quick points and
we let them back into the game. We began to catch
on toward the end but it was too late."
"We were tentative after the first game." Root
said.
