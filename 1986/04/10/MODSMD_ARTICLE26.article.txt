# Cardinal to defend top spot in tennis
## Anteaters netters' next challenge 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
On its home courts for only the
second time in the last five weeks, the
top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team plays host this afternoon at 1:30
p.m. to the UC-Irvine Anteaters.
The Cardinal's last home match
was March 24 against Harvard after
most students had gone elsewhere for
spring break.
"It got a little hectic there for
awhile," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said, referring to the Cardinal's
frequent road trips. "But now we're
back."
Last week Stanford moved into the
No. I spot in the national rankings.
The jump from No. 2 to the summit
reflects the Cardinal's March 27 vic
tory over Trinity, which was previ
ously the top-ranked team.
Since the most recent poll was
released, however, the Cardinal lost
to USC 6-3 last Friday. Hence, the
No. 1 ranking may be short-lived.
"I'm enjoying it right now. because
next week we'll be No. 2," Brennan
said.
"They (the rankings) are fairly ac
curate." he added. "But they're al
ways two weeks late."
Irvine has not had to worry about
the logistics of the national rankings
this season, having compiled an 11-11
11 overall record. To the Anteaters'
credit, though, they have performed
about as well this season as a team
saddled with the aforementioned
nickname could possibly be expected
to.
While the Anteaters may lack tal
ent, they certainly have an abundance
of colorful names. Playing at No. I
singles for most of the season has
been Stephanie Rohrer, whose 9-11
record would indicate that, despite

her last name, she hasn't been making
much noise in the tennis world lately.
Rohrer's doubles partner is none
other than Libby (not Libya) Despot.
And if she can't keep the team in line,
then Irvine can get help from Patton
â€” Colleen, that is.
The coach of this cornucopia of
names is Doreen Irish, whose team
will need more than a little Irish luck
to defeat the Cardinal today.
"They're not too tough," Brennan
said of Irvine. "We're looking for a
breather."
Two of Stanford's regulars will
definitely receive breathers today.
Junior Patty Fendick. the team's No.
1 singles player, and Cari Hagey, who
has a slight stomach pull, will sit out
singles. Both will remain in the
doubles lineup.
Playing in place of Fendick and
Hagey will be seniorco-captain Alyce
Werdel and freshman Sonya
Kazazian.
Fendick, 7-5 in singles this season,
slipped to No. 30 in the most recent
individual rankings. She had been as
high as No. 4.
"Those are all screwed up.' Bren
nan said of the singles rankings.
"They are very invalid because
they're done on a point system where
you can't miss tournaments. The
team (rankings) is at least a vote of
the regional coaches."
Junior Leigh Anne Fldredge tops
the Cardinal in the individual
rankings at No. 14. Freshman Eleni
Rossides is at No. 24. followed by
Fendick and sophomore Kay Tittle,
who is currently ranked No. 34.
Card notes
Yesterday was the first day for high
school seniors to sign letters of intent.
Brennan indicated that he expects to
hear by Friday from a few prospects.
