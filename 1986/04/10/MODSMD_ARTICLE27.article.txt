Mention Stanford football to some
one and the response will likely be
about quarterbacks — Elway.
Plunkett and Brodie. Mentioning
Stanford University conjures up
images of bright young people study
ing to be doctors, lawyers and en
gineers.
But what would you think if the
name Don Bunce was mentioned?
Not only was Bunce one of Stanford's
greatest quarterbacks, but he has
traded in his spikes and helmet for a
stethoscope. Bunce. the MVP of the
1972 Rose Bowl, is now Dr. Bunce.
team physician for the Stanford Card
inal.
Bunce, a local product from Por
tola Valley, attended school at the
Farm from 1967-72. With Bunce
growing up so close to Stanford, one
would think that recruiting him would
have been a shoo-in. But it wasn't.
"I was in an unusual position,"
Bunce said. "I grew up on the other
side of the golf course in Portola Val
ley. John Ralston, who was the coach
then, lived down the street from me. 1
grew up going to Stanford football
games. My friends and 1 worked the
parking gates before the game and
were always throwing a football

around. Stanford had always been a
part of my life.
"But in my senior year in high
school, I started getting letters from
every school in the country. USC
recruited me very hard. O.J. Simpson
took me around down there. John
McKay, their coach at the time, came
lip and had dinner with my parents. I
was thinking about USC very hard
because 1 wanted to play in a Rose
Bowl. 'SC had gone several years in
the past, and that meant a lot to me."
Vet, when Bunce weighed all his
options, the Farm won out. But un
fortunately for the 6-foot-1 blond
quarterback, his problems were not
over.
More precisely, his problem was a
young man named Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett and Bunce had much in
common. They both were local prod
ucts, both lived in Delta Tau Delta
fraternity and both were signal-callers.
Plunkett would go on to garner
All-America honors, win a Heisman
Trophy and lead the then-Indians to
their first Rose Bowl win in many
years. As a result, Bunce spent many
hours watching games from the
sidelines.
"It was really frustrating," Bunce
said. "I played behind Jim my sopho
more and junior years. 1 always felt
that there were things that I could do

better than Jim. like running and
playing the option. Jim is more of a
classic drop-hack passer. I always
knew 1 could play, but I only got a
chance when Jim would get hurt or
when the game was won and they
needed someone to fall on the ball."
Bunce did get his chance in his fifth
year. He led his squad to its second
consecutive Rose Bowl appearance
and an upset win over Michigan on
Rod Garcia's last-second field goal.
Along the way, Bunce was named the
game's most valuable player.
Despite the fact that he wits spend
ing many precious games on the
bench. Bunce never really considered
transferring to another school.
"1 never seriously thought about
it."he said. "1 knew I'd have a year to
myself.l also had to consider the
other aspects of college. You really
can't count on football. Therefore I
felt that 1 had to continue at the best
school I could that played big-time
football."
It was one of the "other" things
that Stanford has to offer that shaped
Bunce's life the most. He decided to
spend part of his junior year in the
Stanfo rd - in -11aly program.
"My time in Italy really affected
me." Bunce said. "It was during this
time that 1 decided to forget about my
political science major and enroll in

the new human biology program. 1
also decided to get married during
this time."
Bunce said that his decision to turn
pre-med so late in his academic
career was actually very beneficial.
He explained that taking classes like
physics and chemistry could have
been disastrous for him as a freshman
or sophomore.
After his Rose Bowl triumph.
Bunce was assured a place in profes
sional football. He was taken by the
Washington Redskins in the 1972
draft, but elected to head north to
play in the Canadian Football League.
"After 1 was drafted, I went back
to talk to George Allen, the coach of
the Redskins," Bunce said. "At the
time the Redskins had Billy Kilmer,
Sonny Jurgenson and Sam Wyche —
all QBs. Allen had a rule about not
playing rookies, so I wasn't even sure
why he drafted me."
Bunce signed with a Canadian
team and played for one year. He
referred to his time in the CFL as
"enjoyable, but not really impor
tant."
"1 was able to make enough money
to put myself through medical school
in that year," Bunce added.

After backing up Jim Plunkett until his senior year, Don Bunce made
the most of his playing time by leading the Cardinal to a win in the 1972
Rose Bowl.
though, didn't believe that he was
going to quit football. Bunce recalled
the skepticism of one particular
player:
"Our middle linebacker said that
the day I became a doctor would be
the day that he became a movie star.
One day I was taking a break and
went to see the movie ' Rocky.' In the
movie, I recognized that the man
playing Apollo Creed was my skepti
cal friend, Carl Weathers."
Bunce attended Stanford Medical
School and took both his surgical in
ternship and orthopedic residency

here. He chose Stanford over any
other place because his wife was
working at Sunset magazine. "1 didn't
want her to have to change her life for
me," Bunce explained.
It was shortly after completing his
training that he was offered the job of
team physician by Fred Behling and
Gordon Campbell, Stanford's two
doctors. Bunce jumped at the offer.
"I saw it as a great opportunity to
give of myself and stay close to Stan
ford football," he said. "I also wanted
to do it because I get really excited
about Stanford football.
"The big difference I see today be
tween my teams and today's teams is
that the athletes today are much bet
ter," Bunce said. "Compared with my

teams, the others we played against
had better athletes, and today they
are much more superior."
Bunce also expressed his prefer
ence for going back to the policy of
not allowing freshmen to play on the
varsity.
"When I came in, I played on the
freshman team," he said. "This was a
great experience because everyone
played. Today, on the varsity only one
or two freshmen play regularly, and
they rarely start. The freshman team
also had a great esprit de corps. We all
kind of promised ourselves that we'd
all go to a Rose Bowl. When we made
it, it was kind of like fulfilling a prom
ise. There was never any doubt that
we could lose."

needed someone to fall on the ball."
Bunce did get his chance in his fifth
year. He led his squad to its second
consecutive Rose Bowl appearance
and an upset win over Michigan on
Rod Garcia's last-second field goal.
Along the way, Bunce was named the
game's most valuable player.
Despite the fact that he wits spend
ing many precious games on the
bench. Bunce never really considered
transferring to another school.
"1 never seriously thought about
it."he said. "1 knew I'd have a year to
myself.l also had to consider the
other aspects of college. You really
can't count on football. Therefore I
felt that 1 had to continue at the best
school I could that played big-time
football."
It was one of the "other" things
that Stanford has to offer that shaped
Bunce's life the most. He decided to
spend part of his junior year in the
Stanfo rd - in -11aly program.
"My time in Italy really affected
me." Bunce said. "It was during this
time that 1 decided to forget about my
political science major and enroll in

the new human biology program. 1
also decided to get married during
this time."
Bunce said that his decision to turn
pre-med so late in his academic
career was actually very beneficial.
He explained that taking classes like
physics and chemistry could have
been disastrous for him as a freshman
or sophomore.
After his Rose Bowl triumph.
Bunce was assured a place in profes
sional football. He was taken by the
Washington Redskins in the 1972
draft, but elected to head north to
play in the Canadian Football League.
"After 1 was drafted, I went back
to talk to George Allen, the coach of
the Redskins," Bunce said. "At the
time the Redskins had Billy Kilmer,
Sonny Jurgenson and Sam Wyche —
all QBs. Allen had a rule about not
playing rookies, so I wasn't even sure
why he drafted me."
Bunce signed with a Canadian
team and played for one year. He
referred to his time in the CFL as
"enjoyable, but not really impor
tant."
"1 was able to make enough money
to put myself through medical school
in that year," Bunce added.

After backing up Jim Plunkett until his senior year, Don Bunce made
the most of his playing time by leading the Cardinal to a win in the 1972
Rose Bowl.
though, didn't believe that he was
going to quit football. Bunce recalled
the skepticism of one particular
player:
"Our middle linebacker said that
the day I became a doctor would be
the day that he became a movie star.
One day I was taking a break and
went to see the movie ' Rocky.' In the
movie, I recognized that the man
playing Apollo Creed was my skepti
cal friend, Carl Weathers."
Bunce attended Stanford Medical
School and took both his surgical in
ternship and orthopedic residency

here. He chose Stanford over any
other place because his wife was
working at Sunset magazine. "1 didn't
want her to have to change her life for
me," Bunce explained.
It was shortly after completing his
training that he was offered the job of
team physician by Fred Behling and
Gordon Campbell, Stanford's two
doctors. Bunce jumped at the offer.
"I saw it as a great opportunity to
give of myself and stay close to Stan
ford football," he said. "I also wanted
to do it because I get really excited
about Stanford football.
"The big difference I see today be
tween my teams and today's teams is
that the athletes today are much bet
ter," Bunce said. "Compared with my

teams, the others we played against
had better athletes, and today they
are much more superior."
Bunce also expressed his prefer
ence for going back to the policy of
not allowing freshmen to play on the
varsity.
"When I came in, I played on the
freshman team," he said. "This was a
great experience because everyone
played. Today, on the varsity only one
or two freshmen play regularly, and
they rarely start. The freshman team
also had a great esprit de corps. We all
kind of promised ourselves that we'd
all go to a Rose Bowl. When we made
it, it was kind of like fulfilling a prom
ise. There was never any doubt that
we could lose."

about quarterbacks — Elway.

But what would you think if the
name Don Bunce was mentioned?
Not only was Bunce one of Stanford's
greatest quarterbacks, but he has
traded in his spikes and helmet for a
stethoscope. Bunce. the MVP of the
1972 Rose Bowl, is now Dr. Bunce.
team physician for the Stanford Card
inal.
Bunce, a local product from Por
tola Valley, attended school at the
Farm from 1967-72. With Bunce
growing up so close to Stanford, one
would think that recruiting him would
have been a shoo-in. But it wasn't.
"I was in an unusual position,"
Bunce said. "I grew up on the other
side of the golf course in Portola Val
ley. John Ralston, who was the coach
then, lived down the street from me. 1
grew up going to Stanford football
games. My friends and 1 worked the
parking gates before the game and
were always throwing a football

around. Stanford had always been a
part of my life.
"But in my senior year in high
school, I started getting letters from
every school in the country. USC
recruited me very hard. O.J. Simpson
took me around down there. John
McKay, their coach at the time, came
lip and had dinner with my parents. I
was thinking about USC very hard
because 1 wanted to play in a Rose
Bowl. 'SC had gone several years in
the past, and that meant a lot to me."
Vet, when Bunce weighed all his
options, the Farm won out. But un
fortunately for the 6-foot-1 blond
quarterback, his problems were not
over.
More precisely, his problem was a
young man named Jim Plunkett.
Plunkett and Bunce had much in
common. They both were local prod
ucts, both lived in Delta Tau Delta
fraternity and both were signal-callers.
Plunkett would go on to garner
All-America honors, win a Heisman
Trophy and lead the then-Indians to
their first Rose Bowl win in many
years. As a result, Bunce spent many
hours watching games from the
sidelines.
"It was really frustrating," Bunce
said. "I played behind Jim my sopho
more and junior years. 1 always felt
that there were things that I could do

better than Jim. like running and
playing the option. Jim is more of a
classic drop-hack passer. I always
knew 1 could play, but I only got a
chance when Jim would get hurt or
when the game was won and they
needed someone to fall on the ball."
