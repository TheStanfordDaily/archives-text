# Haines inks blue chippers

Texas' Patty Sabo won the 400-yard individual medley
at this year's NCAA Championships with a 4:16 timing.
Yesterday, Stanford Coach George Haines signed two
high school swimmers who have both bettered Sabo's
mark.
Michelle Griglione, a 16-year-old senior at T.C. Wil
liams High School in Alexandria, Va., has a best of
4:12.95 in the 400 IM, and St. Louis product Laura
McLean boasts a personal record of 4:14.
"I thought they were No. 1 and No. 2 in the country,"
Haines said. "Both of them are great academically. Both
of them are (blue chip recruits)."
Griglione is the bluest of the blues and not only one of
the best high school swimmers but also one of the best in
the world. In last year's long-course rankings, she was the
top-ranked U.S. swimmer and No. 2 in the world in the
200 IM. She was also No. 2 globally in the 400 IM.
"It went down to the wire," Haines said of the recruit
ing battle with Florida for the talented swimmer's
services. "She only told me Friday night."
"It was a difficult choice," Griglione told the Times
Tribune, "But the more I studied it, the more I knew
Stanford would be the place for me." Griglione recently
won the 200 butterfly, the 200 IM and the 400 IM at the
short-course nationals, although she competed in another

meet the week before and had not shaved for the cham
pionships.
"She'll be a lot better." Haines predicted, although
Griglione's times in the three events would all have been
Stanford records.
McLean's best in the 400 IM would also be a Cardinal
record. She seconded Griglione in both IM races at the
nationals and copped a third in the 200 backstroke.
"I'm looking forward to training with her." she said of
Griglione.
McLean's choice of schools was also a difficult one.
"It was a hard decision between the University of
Texas, Stanford and North Carolina," she said trom her
St. Louis home. "(But) 1 kind of wanted to go to Stanford
since I was a little girl. It's so cool. They have a good swim
team, and they have a good coach."
McLean is currently training rigorously with workouts
from 5 to 7 in the morning and afternoon practices lasting
over two hours.
"I'd like to make the World Championship team this
summer," she said. "My future goal is to make the '88
Olympics."
McLean will attempt to lead the Cardinal to the NCAA
Championship before the Olympics, though, and of com
ing to the Farm she said. "I can't wait."
Haines has not finished the year's recruiting yet, and he
said he is hoping to receive a commitment from
hrpaststroker Jill Johnson soon
