Explosion probably caused crash
MEXICO CITY — An in-flight explosion "very probably" caused the
crash nine days ago of a Mexicana airliner in which 166 persons died,
and a bomb may have been aboard, a spokesman for Mexico's main
airline pilots' union said yesterday.
In London, two senior officials of the international federation of
pilots unions were quoted as saying that Mexican union representatives
had said that there was substantial evidence that a bomb caused the
crash.
However, the Mexican union spokesman here denied that his union's
delegates in London, who were attending a routine conference there,
had told anyone that a bomb caused the crash. The spokesman, Jaime
Gonzalez, said that his organization had not reached a formal conclusion
about the crash.
Gonzalez, press secretary for the Mexican airline pilot's union, said
that union members believed that the scattering of the Boeing 727-200's
wreckage over a widespread area indicated that it had blown up in
midair. "Very probably, there was an explosion," Gonzalez told
reporters at his office. Gonzalez said that the explosion might have been
caused by a bomb, but he cautioned that "there are other possibilities as
well."
In Washington, a U.S. source familiar with the probe said, "We know
for sure there was an in-flight breakup and an in-flight fire, beyond that
we don't know." The source conceded, however, that "I can't envision
any other flight regime (besides a bomb) that would cause that." U.S. of
ficials cautioned that although two U.S. observers are in Mexico, so far
they have little hard information about the accident.
United Press International quoted Mexican pilots as saying privately
that they believed that a bomb caused the crash, and that someone may
have planted it to recover insurance money from one of the victims. Un
ion spokesman Gonzalez said that such a possibility "cannot be dis
counted" but that "it seems overdramatized."
Germany expels two Libyan envoys
BONN, West Germany — The West German government ordered
yesterday the expulsion of two Libyan diplomats following U.S.
demands lor action in response to a weekend bomb explosion at a West
Berlin discotheque in which an American Army sergeant was killed and
64 other Americans, mostly servicemen, were injured.
The two Libyans were told to leave West Germany immediately on
grounds they had been engaged in "impermissible activities" that a
Bonn government spokesman said threatened American as well as West
German security interests.
Friedhelm Ost, the chief government spokesman, quoted Chancellor
Helmut Kohl as telling the West German Cabinet yesterday: "We will
not let our American friends be bombed or terrorized out of the
country."
But Ost said the West German government so far had no firm
evidence implicating the two men, middle-ranking diplomats in the
Libyan mission here, in the Berlin explosion and was acting on the
results of earlier police investigations into their activities.
Excitement builds for leader's visit
LAHORE, Pakistan — For more than a week, political workers have
been coursing through the countryside chanting, "Chalo Lahore" — "Go
to Lahore" — for excitement has been building over the arrival today of
Benazir Bhutto, daughter of the late prime minister and populist leader
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
After more than eight years of imprisonment and exile, Benazir
Bhutto is expected to resume the leadership of the Pakistan People's
Party, the country's main opposition party.
The rally is expected to be the most significant demonstration yet of
the democratic tradition restored after martial law was lifted in Decem
ber by President Zia ui-Haq. For most of the martial-law period, politi
cal demonstrations were not permitted at all.
As the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whom Zia deposed in 1977
and then had executed in 1979, Benazir, 33, has become the symbol of
Pakistan's lost democracy. And the party whose leadership she inherits
is still the largest and most political in the country.
Chirac calls for sale of industries
PARIS — Premier Jacques Chirac defied a constitutional threat from
President Francois Mitterrand and presented his new, conservative pro
gram to the French National Assembly yesterday, calling on deputies to
break with French tradition by downgrading state controls in favor of a
free market.
But the narrowness of his majority in the assembly and the threat of
future presidential vetoes made it clear that Chirac will have difficulty
delivering the "vigorous action of renewal" that he promised for France.
"France lives today in a great moment of hope." he said in his first
parliamentary speech since his appointment as premier three weeks ago.
"The French await, they hope for change. Our duty is to respond to that
hope."
But his first proposed actions, a series of decrees selling a large num
ber of France's nationalized companies, ran into a constitutional snag.
Mitterrand told a morning meeting of the Chirac Cabinet that he would
refuse to sign any decree selling a company nationalized before he came
to power in 198 I. Moreover, he insisted that he would examine closely
the decrees on other issues before signing them.
Aquino defends her new regime
MANILA. Philippines — President Corazon Aquino, in the first of a
series of informal interviews on government television, defended her
new regime last night, declaring "I am not a dictator."
Questioned by a single, sympathetic newswoman, Aquino said that
she will not oppose plans of members of deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos' political party to reconvene the National Assembly next Mon
day in defiance of her abolition of the legislature.
"That is their problem."' she said. "They can say whatever they want
... I am not a dictator."
Wearing yellow as usual but without her glasses, and seated on a rat
tan couch with a pensive photograph of her assassinated husband,
Benigno Aquino, on a table behind her, the president answered ques
tions in both English and Tagalog. a national language.
Marcos supporters and others have criticized Aquino for taking law
making powers to herself, but she insisted that elections for a new na
tional legislature and local officials cannot be held until a new constitu
tion is written and ratified in a plebiscite, probably a year from now.
On the possibility of elections for delegates to a constitution-writing
commission, she declared: "We cannot afford them. That's the sad truth.
Mr. Marcos left us in economic ruin."
Third World's outlook improves
W ASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary James Baker yesterday said
that lower oil prices, the cheaper dollar and lower interest rates have
combined to provide the best economic outlook for Third World nations
since the early 19705.
But Baker warned that improved growth among the debtor nations,
based on internal economic changes, will be "essential to any resolution
of the debt problem." Without substantive changes. Baker said, "no
amount of money' will solve the problem of overhanging debt, which is
expected to hit SI trillion b> the end of 1986.
In two speeches to the International Monetary Fund's Interim Com
mittee — which began a two-day meeting here yesterday on a range of
global economic issues — Baker stressed the debt problem related to in
ternational monetary chances.
