This is the second of a two-part
series on the trends and effects of
cocaine use at Stanford. The first in

of warm blankets, "Karen" walks
briskly across a still campus to her
friend s dorm room.
Karen knocks, waking her friend,
and rushes through the opening
door.
"I need to do some more lines."
she says, as she anxiously searches
the room for some cocaine left over
from their earlier evening partying.
"I can't go to sleep."

Karen rummages through the
desk drawers of her protesting,
sleepy-eyed friend. When she dis
covers nothing, she grabs the tele
phone and dials other friends. If she
can just get a couple of lines now, it
will he morning soon and she can
then buy some more from her
dealer-friend at her campus apart
ment complex.
Karen, a senior who has lost 15
pounds and spent close to $4,000
on cocaine in the last three months,
sometimes doesn't sleep for three
nights straight. She and some of her
friends know she is addicted to
cocaine. But they don't know what
to do about it.
"1 can't control it." Karen says.
"I can think of only one thing â€”
how 1 can get more coke. ... It's
hard to face your friends after
that."

In the last few years, cocaine, or
"coke,"' has reached celebrity
heights. Its use among athletes,
musicians, actors and entertainers
has made the white powder a
glamorous status symbol, a way
into the wild, jet-set world of the
wealthy chic.
Students at Stanford and other
universities have not been immune
to the seduction. According to Uni
versity officials and drug experts,
cocaine is behind only alcohol
and marijuana as students' drug of
choice. The psychologically ad
dictive substance is used by increas
ing numbers of undergraduates,
they say. and some users are selling
it on campus to support their own
habits.
