# Coke adds life, or does it?

This is the second of a two-part
series on the trends and effects of
cocaine use at Stanford. The first in
stallment appeared Monday.
At 5 a.m., when most students at
the University lie under the cover

Feature

of warm blankets, "Karen" walks
briskly across a still campus to her
friend s dorm room.
Karen knocks, waking her friend,
and rushes through the opening
door.
"I need to do some more lines."
she says, as she anxiously searches
the room for some cocaine left over
from their earlier evening partying.
"I can't go to sleep."

Karen rummages through the
desk drawers of her protesting,
sleepy-eyed friend. When she dis
covers nothing, she grabs the tele
phone and dials other friends. If she
can just get a couple of lines now, it
will he morning soon and she can
then buy some more from her
dealer-friend at her campus apart
ment complex.
Karen, a senior who has lost 15
pounds and spent close to $4,000
on cocaine in the last three months,
sometimes doesn't sleep for three
nights straight. She and some of her
friends know she is addicted to
cocaine. But they don't know what
to do about it.
"1 can't control it." Karen says.
"I can think of only one thing —
how 1 can get more coke. ... It's
hard to face your friends after
that."

In the last few years, cocaine, or
"coke,"' has reached celebrity
heights. Its use among athletes,
musicians, actors and entertainers
has made the white powder a
glamorous status symbol, a way
into the wild, jet-set world of the
wealthy chic.
Students at Stanford and other
universities have not been immune
to the seduction. According to Uni
versity officials and drug experts,
cocaine is behind only alcohol
and marijuana as students' drug of
choice. The psychologically ad
dictive substance is used by increas
ing numbers of undergraduates,
they say. and some users are selling
it on campus to support their own
habits.
A 1983 student health survey
found that 14 percent of students at Stanford
had tried cocaine and 3 percent used it regu
larly, reported Dr. Alejandro Martinez,
director of the study. Several students said
the actual numbers are much higher than the
survey results.
Stanford undergraduates may be especially
prone to cocaine use because of the pressures
of the campus environment, said Dr. Mary
Anne Edwards, director of the Toxisearch
Treatment Center in Redwood City.
At Stanford, "the pressure is to do well,"
she said, adding that stress can activate drug
dependency. "Since all your friends are (high
school) valedictorians . . . it's pretty stress
ful."
Some students find the campus environ
ment here and at other universities — which
often emphasize academic success, socializing
and sexual relationships — threatening.
"Being super bright and super attractive
does not always mean that what's inside is
great," Edwards said. "Stanford students are
able to conceal drugs because most are bright
kids."
A combination of personality, social accept
ability, drug availability and genetic make
up make some people more predisposed to
cocaine addiction than others, she said.
Some students said that they first tried
cocaine as freshmen because they wanted to
be socially accepted by their new classmates.
"Use increases as you go through Stan
ford," said one senior majoring in economics
who said he is trying to abstain from the drug
now although he used to use it two or three
times a week. "You may never try it until
your freshman year (here), and then it
becomes part of the big bash — and the little
bash.
"You find out it's really cool," he said. "It's
like learning to have a few beers."
But unlike drinking alcohol, most cocaine

users like the drug their first time. Cocaine is
a stimulant found in the leaves of the coca
plant, and users say the drug produces a
feeling of intensified euphoria and general
elation.
Doctors have redefined the term addiction
to include psychological factors constistent
with cocaine addiction: compulsive use, loss
of control over that use and continued use in
spite of adverse consequences.
"There is that sense that I'm out of control,
but I can't stop all horses at once," said the
economics senior who added he sometimes
abuses the drug.
While coasumption of cocaine has tripled
in the past three years, so has the number of
cocaine-related deaths. In 1984 alone,
400,000 users required clinical treatment.
More than 25 million Americans have now
tried the drug, according to a spokeswoman
at SOO-COCAINE, a national and referral
hot-line.
Several users said that cocaine sometimes
makes them paraniod.
"You're sensitive to every thought," one
user said. "Everything gives you warning be
cause you covet and protect the coke. . . .
You lock the doors and turn down the bright
lights.
"And you have thoughts of'l want more,'
even if you don't say it,"the user added.
Prolonged cocaine use can cause physical
as well as psychological damage. Convulsions,
seizures, loss of appetite, loss of sexual drive,
hallucinations and even suicidal tendencies
replace the initial high as cocaine use contin
ues over a period of time, experts said.
Other long-term effects include tremors,
weight loss, chest pains, blurred vision,
nausea and mucous membrane damage at the
site of application.
Some University officials are aware of stu
dent cocaine use but are reluctant to monitor
the private lives of students.
"I think that people of this age will experi
ment and think that it's cool to do things that
are illicit," said Alice Supton, assistant dean
of Residential Education.

Supton said the University is more con
cerned with students who are selling the drug
than with recreational users. "We take a
more active intervention with sellers," she
said. "We don't try to monitor student use."
Residential Education will intervene,
however, to help students who have aca
demic, health, weight loss or mood-swing
problems related to drug use, Supton added.
One retired dealer said he felt less at risk
selling cocaine on campus than off campus. In
the past few years, the University has acted to
rebuke known dealers through written letters
that asked them to stop selling illegal sub
stances or they would not be allowed to regis
ter again at the University, several students,
said. Seldom have police intervened, the stu
dents reported.
As a dealer,"! was surprised how little 1
had to worry," one senior said. "I (reminded)
myself that the worst they could do to me was
tell me to quit."
Supton, however, said students here aren't
protected from the police. "The University
doesn't enforce the law, but we don't protect
students from it ... . There's no benevolent
institutional protection."
Some Stanford dealers sell cocaine and
other drugs to customers who come from
outside the University. One senior who had
been selling cocaine for four months this year
before he became fed up with all-day and all
night buyers, said that more than a quarter of
his customers came from outside the Univer
sity. Some were Palo Alto High School
alumnae, he said.
Two long-time cocaine users said that the
number of drug dealers on campus is smaller
than it was three years ago, but that there is
no shortage of the drug for interested buyers.
"You can always get some when you want
it," said one engineering graduate student.
Martinez said that undergraduates re
ported using more cocaine than graduate stu
dents. International students at Stanford use
less cocaine than anybody else; Caucasians
use more cocaine, as well as alcohol and mari
juana, than any other ethnic group, he said.

A student health survey taken in 1983 reported that 14 percent of all Stanford students
admitted to trying cocaine. Three percent said they were regular users.
