# Reagan warns Khadafi on terror

### 
WASHINGTON — As President Reagan
denounced Libyan leader Moammar Khadafi, call
ing him "the mad dog of the Middle East," the
Defense Department yesterday ordered two U.S.
Navy aircraft carriers to move into position for pos
sible retaliation against the Tripoli regime.
At a nationally televised news conference,
Reagan said that Libya has singled out the United
States for repeated terrorist attacks. Nevertheless,
he stopped short of blaming Libya directly for the
bombings of a TW A airliner and a West Berlin dis
cotheque last week.
Earlier, however, Reagan had told a group of
newspaper executives that Khadafi was "definitely
a suspect" in the two most recent attacks, which
killed five Americans.
Meanwhile, in Tripoli, the Libyan capital,
Khadafi said that a U.S. attack would set off
retaliation against American interests around the
world and that plans for a military confrontation
had been completed.
"So far, we have not instructed such actions, such

attacks," he said at a news conference with West
ern reporters.
At his news conference, the president said, "This
mad dog of the Middle East has a goal of a world
revolution, Moslem fundamentalist revolution, tar
geted on many of his own Arab compatriots."
Khadafi's reasons for selecting the United States
as an enemy, Reagan mused, were "a little like
climbing Mt. Everest — because we are here. But
there is no doubt he has singled us out more and
more for attack."
At the end of a day in which reports circulated
that the president already had decided on a plan of
retaliation, Reagan declined to talk about his mili
tary options because, he said, that would be "like
talking about battle plans."
But, he declared, "when we could specifically
identify someone responsible for one of these
(terrorist) acts, we would respond. This is what
we're trying to do, to find out who's responsible,
for a fine sergeant in our military dead, and 50
young Americans lying in a hospital wounded be

cause of that dastardly attack in West Berlin."
Pentagon sources said that the aircraft carriers
Coral Sea and America were ordered to stand by
where they could move quickly into waters off
Libya. The two ships took part two weeks ago in
operations that tested Khadati s claims that the
Gulf of Sidra is part of Libyan territorial waters.
The Pentagon said that the Coral Sea, which had
been due to end its six-month deployment and
head home to Norfolk, Va., was ordered to remain
indefinitely in the Mediterranean.
But Pentagon officials emphasized that no deci
sion had been made on what steps, it any, would be
taken in response to the attack last Saturday on a
West Berlin nightclub popular with off-duty U.S.
military personnel or for the TWA explosion that
killed four Americans April 2.
With Reagan Administration officials apparently
convinced that Libya could be linked, at least to the
West Berlin blast, military planners were focusing
on potential avenues of retribution.
Nevertheless, Reagan carefully avoided making
direct accusations at his news conference.
