WASHINGTON — The collapse
of the Contadora peace talks in
Central America and last month's in
cursion by Nicaraguan troops into
neighboring Honduras prove that
Nicaragua's Sandinista regime will
not negotiate a Central American
peace and will respond only to force,
President Reagan declared yesterday.
Reagan used a nationally televised
news conference to urge the House to
reverse last month's vote and approve
his proposed $100 million in aid to
Nicaragua's contra guerrillas.
The House, which rejected the aid
by a 222-210 vote March 20, is
scheduled to vote again on the pro
posal next Tuesday. The Senate voted
53 to 47 on March 27 to approve
Reagan's aid package.
Two days after last month's House
vote, Nicaraguan troops crossed the
Honduran border in pursuist of con
tra forces who regularly seek sanctu
ary there.
The Contadora talks, involving
Nicaragua and 12 other Latin
countries, collapsed Sunday, and the
president charged that the Sandinista

government "torpedoed " the
negotiations.
Critics of the president's policy
have charged that it is his aid to the
contras, whom Reagan decribed as
"freedom fighters," that caused the
breakdown in the peace talks.
But Reagan declared in an opening
statement that the end of the talks
and the Honduran invasion
"demonstrate that the Nicaraguan
communists will never make peace
with their neighbors or with their own
people unless the pressure on thern
increases. The Communists must
realize that they cannot crush their
opponents, and our assistance can
ensure that the freedom fighters are
not crushed."
The President said his aid proposal,
if enacted, "will give Nicaraguans a
choice, and it will give diplomacy a
chance."
The press conference, the first
since Feb. 11 and the third this year,
was dominated by questions about
U.S. plans to meet the threat of
Libyan terrorism. But Reagan also:
• Warned, without recommending

any specific U.S. response, that major
oil-producing nations may be forcing
down prices to drive competitors out
of business and establish a monopoly
that would enable them to send prices
rocketing up again.
• Conceded that a second summit
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev is unlikely before July and said
he would postpone a meeting until
after the November congressional
elections if the two leaders cannot
agree to get together by July.
• Vowed to continue to observe the
second Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty if the Soviets do and withheld
judgment on whether the Soviets
have violated the treaty.
• Said it would be "foolhardy" for
Congress? to make further cuts from
his defense budget and urged deeper
cuts in domestic spending.
• Denied that the White House pres
sured the National Aeronatics and
Space Administration to launch the
Challenger shuttle, which exploded in
mid-air in January.
The president, asked about falling
oil prices, said the United States must

be alert to the possibility that oil
producing countries might drive oil
prices down to discourage explora
tion by competitors in a ploy to gain a
monoply and raise prices later. Al
though Reagan said he believes that
the free market should determine
prices, he noted that some oil produc
ers are governments and that "you
cannot ignore the possibility" that
prices would be driven down
deliberately to stifle future competi
tion.
Reagan said there still has been no
Administration decision on whether
to dismantle two of the U.S. Poseidon
submarines next month to remain in
compliance with terms of the un
ratified SALT II strategic arms treaty
with the Soviet Union.
As things now stand, the United
States will surpass the agreement's
limit on multiple warhead missiles
when a new, larger Trident sub
marine begins sea trials on May 20.
There have been reports that Admin
istration officials are divided over
whether to dismantle two of the older
subs or merely put them into dry dock
as a gesture toward compliance.
