House gun control vote
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday
handily defeated several amendments designed
to curb legislation that would ease the nation's
gun control law, demonstrating in several
lopsided votes that opposition from law enforce
ment groups carried little weight against a drive
for the bill by the powerful National Rifle Asso
ciation.
However, House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) abruptly postponed until
today the final vote on the legislation, as well as a
series of additional amendments. O'Neill cited
budgetary strain from overtime pay to Capitol
employees.
The bill's opponents expressed little hope that
the additional time would change the outcome.
Led by the three million-member NRA, sup
porters of the legislation maintain that the exist
ing gun law, which was passed after Robert Ken
nedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assas
sinated in 1968, is too burdensome on those who
lawfully own and carry guns for sport and protec
tion.
However, opponents say that the bill amounts

to a "cop-killer." because it would make weap
ons more readily available and more difficult to
trace. While many acknowledge a need to loosen
restrictions on the interstate sale and transport of
hunting rifles, they object to making it easier to
carry and buy easily concealable handguns across
state lines.
Tax bill favors industry
WASHINGTON — The Senate Finance Com
mittee, clearly demonstrating its favoritism
toward heavy industry, moved yesterday toward
approval of a complex proposal that would pro
vide further tax write-offs for manufacturing,
telephone and mining companies at the expense
of most service companies.
Sen. William Roth Jr. (R-Del.) introduced an
amendment to the tax bill — which appeared to
have the support of a majority of the panel mem
bers — aimed at cushioning most manufacturing
industries against the expected loss of the 10 per
cent investment tax credit.
The proposal, compared with the original plan
offered by Chairman Bob Packwood (R-Ore.),

would funnel an estimated $24 billion over five
years in additional write-offs for specific business
investments, supporters say.
As a result, the proposal would cost another
$16 billion over the next five years, requiring the
committee to find that much in revenue from
other sources to avoid widening the federal
budget deficit.
In contrast to the House tax bill, which would
cut back on business depreciation write-offs by
about $41 billion over five years, the amendment
would leave the Senate bill actually increasing
such write-offs by about $4 billion.
Stocks gain moderately
NEW YORK — The stock market closed out a
session of wide swings with a moderate gain yes
terday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
8.86 to 1,778.62, bringing its gain over the past
two sessions to 43.1 1 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 156.25 million shares, up from 146.29
million Tuesday.
