Students enter meeting
About 125 slogan-chanting UCLA students
yesterday disrupted a session of the university's
investment advisory committee that was review
ing the University of California's holdings in
companies doing business with South Africa.
But they left in orderly fashion after Chancel
lor Charles Young, who chairs the advisory com
mittee composed of students, faculty and admi
nistrators, asked them to do so.
As they complied, the students referred to the
members of the committee as "white trash" and
brandished cardboard tombstones bearing the
names of South African blacks killed by police.
Anti-apartheid demonstrations continued in
Berkeley, meantime, where confrontations have
been going on since last week when police dis
mantled a small shantytown erected by protesters
to symbolize conditions facing blacks in South
Africa.
For the second day, the protesters formed a
human blockade around the Berkeley campus
administration building. The demonstrators dis
solved after an early afternoon rally.
At UCLA, before the fellow protesters left the
meeting, the investment advisory committee
voted down three resolutions relating to divest
ment or police brutality proposed by one of the
two student members of the advisory panel,
Frances Hasso, a UCLA international relations
major.
A high-ranking university official in Berkeley

disclosed yesterday that a campus police officer
has been placed on limited duty and recom
mended for counseling after reports that he used
excessive force in last week's demonstrations.
The committee instead agreed to a much
milder resolution supporting students' rights to
make their feelings known but deploring
brutality by anyone.
Explosives cause of fire
SAN FRANCISCO â€” The search for more
bodies in the ruins of a flattened industrial com
plex wound down yesterday as investigators
looked into the possibility that an illegal
fireworks factory may have caused the explosion
blamed for up to nine deaths.
Fire investigators have said they have the
names of nine people reported missing and
presumed killed in the $10 million Bay View In
dustrial Park blaze.
"We have names of nine too, but we've
recovered only seven, maybe eight." said Joseph
Surdkya, spokesman for the coroner's office. He
identified two victims as Patricia Livingston, 32,
a woodworker who made redwood trinkets and
souvenirs: and Phillip Marta, 19, a circulation
worker with The New York Times. The other
victims have not been identified.
Additional victims still could be discovered at
the fire site, but a fire captain at the scene said
specially trained search dogs that aided the effort

on Tuesday had been called off.
"They don't expect to find any more
(victims),*' said the captain who asked not to be
named. "They feel pretty confident they've got
all the people accounted for."
News reports quoted unidentified sources as
saying that a machine was found half buried in
the center of the Hunter's Point site. The ma
chine, which reportedly was operating at the time
of the explosion, could have produced powerful
fireworks such as barrel bombs called M-8()s and
cherry bombs.
"The machine had no other function other
than to make fireworks," one source was quoted
as saying.
U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said he met
with agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms on Tuesday to discuss
their search for records of telephone calls by
people in the suspected fireworks operation.
District Attorney Arlo Smith said his office
may obtain search warrants to check telephone
records and other material such as shipping in
voices.
But fire officials were tight-lipped about thoir
investigation.
