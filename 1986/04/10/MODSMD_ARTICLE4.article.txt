# COP slates offer differing views
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A Branner Hall debate last night between the
two slates running for ASSU Council of Presi
dents featured two quite different groups, one
vowing to improve student services and increase
awareness of minority issues, and the other
vowing to "make college fun."
"The Real Solution" slate — with Kim Craw
ford, Rudy Fuentes, Mary Thurber and Carey
White — said it hoped to revitalize student gov
ernment with outreach programs and to serve
the student body by serving as a springboard for
student initiatives.
The "Josh" slate — with Josh Weinstein, Jim
Suhre, Alex Danel and Chris Adamson —
called for parties, games and a new student un
ion, all aimed at what they termed the primary
purpose of college: fun.
The "Josh" presentation featured a song in
which the slate's members tried to rhyme the
words "solution," "union" and "illusion," and a
call for a complex new University building proj
ect. In the project, large white dots would be
painted on 12 trailers in Manzanita Park and
the trailers would then be airlifted to the
Mojave Desert, where the gods, the slate
asserted, would look down approvingly at their
"new Manzanita dominoes."
The "Josh" slate also proposed a campus-wide
hide-and-go-seek game in which University
President Donald Kennedy would have to find
all registered students; a musical chairs game in
Stanford Stadium: and a student lottery offering
as grand prizes a Ferrari and a mansion in
Atherton.

Members of the slate, which is composed of
four Chaparral staffers, occasionally offered
serious remarks, noting at one point that they
will "do everything possible" to restore funding
for five varsity teams whose funds were recently
cut by the Athletic Department. Their justifica
tion for the move was that "sports are fun."
"The Real Solution." which showed fewer
smiles but more serious proposals than their op
ponents. said that it sought to replace the West
ern Culture program with a world culture pro
gram, lessen misconceptions about theme
houses at Stanford, and ensure that the current
services provided by the ASSU remain func
tional.
The slate also vowed to increase student par
ticipation in the ASSU and to improve commu
nication with the administration.
"The Real Solution" noted that three mem
bers of the slate are active in the ASSU, and
said their knowledge of the ASSU system would
prove beneficial. The slate members also em
phasized work they have done on minority is
sues, programming and finance.
The "Josh" slate cited its members' creden
tials as well, noting that the four helped run the
Chaparral. The slate members said they had
eliminated the humor magazine's deficit in the
last year. "We're not all jokes," said Suhre.
"We know how to run a business."
Each slate began with an eight-minute
presentation, then each was given three minutes
for rebuttal, and then the candidates fielded
questions for about a half-hour. Members of the
"Josh" slate drank beer throughout the
presentation.
Weinstein, who donned decorative
X-ray glasses and tuxedo wear, often
served as spokesman for the "Josh"
slate, with Danel at one point trans
lating his colleague's statements into
Polish. For the musical numbers,
Suhre ably handled the guitar and
lead vocals.
The members of "The Real Solu
tion" divided their speaking time
evenly and remained on the wagon
for the entire hour.
They asserted that they, too, want
to "make college fun" but said they
knew when to get serious.
"It's good to have fun," said
Fuentes, "but we have a lot of in
itiatives out there that go beyond
fun."
The "Josh" slate noted that it is not
running as a joke but wants to win.
"We are a slate that likes to joke
around and have fun," Weinstein
said. "We're serious about winning,
but we want to show the joke in all
this.. .. What if, instead of
king, you had a court jester rule?"
The "Josh" slate referred to its op

ponents at different times as "The
Wrong Solution," "The Seven Per
cent Solution" and"The Final Solu
tion."
"The Real Solution" slate con
tended that "Josh" has failed to lay
out feasible methods for running the
ASSU.
The question-and-answer period
highlighted differences between the
two slates.
Asked about theme houses at Stan
ford, Fuentes and Crawford, of "The
Real Solution," discussed ways of
clearing up commonly held miscon
ceptions in hopes of encouraging
non-minorities to live in those
residences.
Weinstein responded to the ques
tion by proposing that the University
create a Polish theme house, with
beds on the ceilings. Adamson of
fered a more serious response, saying
that people who have not lived in a
theme house have no right to pass
judgment on their value.
Asked about how they will handle
the great amount of routine, clerical
work that comes with the presidential
job. White said "The Real Solution"
will be "professional" and will "get
the services done."
Weinstein said, "Fun is routine."

"The Real Solution" slate — with Kim Craw
ford, Rudy Fuentes, Mary Thurber and Carey
White — said it hoped to revitalize student gov
ernment with outreach programs and to serve
the student body by serving as a springboard for
student initiatives.
The "Josh" slate — with Josh Weinstein, Jim
Suhre, Alex Danel and Chris Adamson —
called for parties, games and a new student un
ion, all aimed at what they termed the primary
purpose of college: fun.
The "Josh" presentation featured a song in
which the slate's members tried to rhyme the
words "solution," "union" and "illusion," and a
call for a complex new University building proj
ect. In the project, large white dots would be
painted on 12 trailers in Manzanita Park and
the trailers would then be airlifted to the
Mojave Desert, where the gods, the slate
asserted, would look down approvingly at their
"new Manzanita dominoes."
The "Josh" slate also proposed a campus-wide
hide-and-go-seek game in which University
President Donald Kennedy would have to find
all registered students; a musical chairs game in
Stanford Stadium: and a student lottery offering
as grand prizes a Ferrari and a mansion in
Atherton.

Members of the slate, which is composed of
four Chaparral staffers, occasionally offered
serious remarks, noting at one point that they
will "do everything possible" to restore funding
for five varsity teams whose funds were recently
cut by the Athletic Department. Their justifica
tion for the move was that "sports are fun."
"The Real Solution." which showed fewer
smiles but more serious proposals than their op
ponents. said that it sought to replace the West
ern Culture program with a world culture pro
gram, lessen misconceptions about theme
houses at Stanford, and ensure that the current
services provided by the ASSU remain func
tional.
The slate also vowed to increase student par
ticipation in the ASSU and to improve commu
nication with the administration.
"The Real Solution" noted that three mem
bers of the slate are active in the ASSU, and
said their knowledge of the ASSU system would
prove beneficial. The slate members also em
phasized work they have done on minority is
sues, programming and finance.
The "Josh" slate cited its members' creden
tials as well, noting that the four helped run the
Chaparral. The slate members said they had
eliminated the humor magazine's deficit in the
last year. "We're not all jokes," said Suhre.
"We know how to run a business."
Each slate began with an eight-minute
presentation, then each was given three minutes
for rebuttal, and then the candidates fielded
questions for about a half-hour. Members of the
"Josh" slate drank beer throughout the
presentation.
Weinstein, who donned decorative
X-ray glasses and tuxedo wear, often
served as spokesman for the "Josh"
slate, with Danel at one point trans
lating his colleague's statements into
Polish. For the musical numbers,
Suhre ably handled the guitar and
lead vocals.
The members of "The Real Solu
tion" divided their speaking time
evenly and remained on the wagon
for the entire hour.
They asserted that they, too, want
to "make college fun" but said they
knew when to get serious.
"It's good to have fun," said
Fuentes, "but we have a lot of in
itiatives out there that go beyond
fun."
The "Josh" slate noted that it is not
running as a joke but wants to win.
"We are a slate that likes to joke
around and have fun," Weinstein
said. "We're serious about winning,
but we want to show the joke in all
this.. .. What if, instead of
king, you had a court jester rule?"
The "Josh" slate referred to its op

ponents at different times as "The
Wrong Solution," "The Seven Per
cent Solution" and"The Final Solu
tion."
"The Real Solution" slate con
tended that "Josh" has failed to lay
out feasible methods for running the
ASSU.
The question-and-answer period
highlighted differences between the
two slates.
Asked about theme houses at Stan
ford, Fuentes and Crawford, of "The
Real Solution," discussed ways of
clearing up commonly held miscon
ceptions in hopes of encouraging
non-minorities to live in those
residences.
Weinstein responded to the ques
tion by proposing that the University
create a Polish theme house, with
beds on the ceilings. Adamson of
fered a more serious response, saying
that people who have not lived in a
theme house have no right to pass
judgment on their value.
Asked about how they will handle
the great amount of routine, clerical
work that comes with the presidential
job. White said "The Real Solution"
will be "professional" and will "get
the services done."
Weinstein said, "Fun is routine."

A Branner Hall debate last night between the
two slates running for ASSU Council of Presi

vowing to improve student services and increase
awareness of minority issues, and the other
vowing to "make college fun."
