# ASSU to investigate food service contract
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate has formed a
subcommittee to investigate alle
gations that Stanford may contract
University Food Service to Saga,
the Menlo Park-based corporation
that currently operates conces
sions at the Coffee House and
Tresidder Union.
The senate formed the subcom
mittee after United Stanford
Workers (USW) representative
Linda Crouse told senators during
open forum Tuesday that she
believes the University is consid
ering a contract switch, adding
that such action would mean that
"(food service) workers would
lose the rights it took us years to
gain."
Crouse said that because
workers employed by University
Food Service "form the largest
part of the union," contracting
with Saga "would take them out of
the union."
Both University Food Service
Manager James Keeton and
Tresidder Union Food Service

Director Sue Tatum have said that
Crouse's claim is "untrue."
Keeton added that William
Massy, University vice president
of Business and Finance, assured
him last fall that a contract change
"is not being considered at this
time."
At Tuesday's senate meeting,
Crouse said that "students in
dorms should make a commitment
to boycott outside food services,"
adding that "community opinion is
the only thing that can fight" the
contract changes.
Undergraduate Senate Deputy
Chair Ed Renwick, a member of
the subcommittee, said the group's
task is to "research Crouse's
claims and decide what to do."
While the senate can organize a
boycott of student dormitories,
Renwick said he "questions the
success" of such action, and
"personally doubts" that a boycott
will take place.
The main role of the subcom
mittee on the USW issue is
"informational," according to
