# Alpha Sig to hire party guards

### MARCUS MABRY Staff writer 
In response to an increase in the number of disruptions
at campus parties by people from outside the Stanford
community. Alpha Sigma house has decided to hire three
professional security guards for its annual Exotic Erotic
Ball Saturday.
House Manager Conan Barker said that the chief rea
son for hiring the professional guards is that "basically, we
want to make sure that the party goes over well so that the
people from Stanford can enjoy it."
According to Diana Conklin. assistant dean of Student
Affairs and director of the Row. University officials have
witnessed a "dramatic increase" in the number of out
siders attending campus parties.
"It's not just Paly (Palo Alto High School) students
coming in from outside, and it's not just fraternities being
affected," Conklin said. "There have been incidences all
over â€” at dorm parties, at Row houses. There have been
hostile confrontations, and damage to houses. To those of
us who have been here a while, it just seems to be getting
worse."
Barker said the suggestion to hire professionals came
from house members and was prompted by the actions of

three different groups of high school students who crashed
a "closed" Alpha Sig alumni party at the house earlier this
year.
"We just want to make sure that we're prepared,"
Barker said. "We don't want to make it any less fun for
Stanford students, hut we don't want 200 high school stu
dents. That's what this is designed to prevent."
Conklin echoed Barker, asking, "Shouldn't Stanford
students be able to have parties and to share them with
other members of this community without worrying
about being run over by outsiders? And why should Stan
ford students foot the bill for the entertainment of Palo
Alto, Menlo Park, Redwood City and San Jose?"
The guards will cost Alpha Sigma between $200 and
$300. Barker said it is "definitely worth the cost," consid
ering that more than $1,000 was stolen from a house
member's room during a party a few years ago, and that
the total cost for Saturday's party exceeds $2,000.
He added that the extra $200 to $300 is "worth the as
surance that the Exotic Erotic Ball will not have to be shut
down by police."
Barker was referring to a February incident in which
the resident assistant of the Theta Xi fraternity called
police after non-Stanford students were disruptive at a
house party. The police later disbanded the party.
