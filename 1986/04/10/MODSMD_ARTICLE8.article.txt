### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Saying that colleges should get their priorities
straight when dealing with athletics, sports col
umnist Pete Axthelm gave a brief talk on gam
bling and then fielded questions from students
in an undergraduate course on gambling last
night.
Axthelm, who is currently writing a series of
columns for the San Francisco Examiner and
has been a regular analyst on NBC's pre-game
pro football show, spoke before about 50 stu
dents enrolled in the Undergraduate Special
course "The Psychological Processes and Con
sequences of Gambling."
Axthelm's talk consisted of humorous
anecdotes about acquaintances of his who are
gamblers and sport such creative names as Fatal
Jane, Doc, Bob the Pink Dinosaur and Fat
Man Jack.
During the question-and-answer period, the
topic turned to the relationship between gam
bling and college athletics. Axthelm was asked
his opinion on whether betting lines on college
football and basketball games should be printed
in the newspapers (as they currently are).
"First let's get our priorities in order," Ax
thelm responded. "Did the Tulane (University
basketball) fixes occur because someone picked
up a newspaper and saw the line? Obviously
not."

"What should we be more appalled al, the
fact that (Tulane player) "Hot Rod" Williams
fixed games or that when they arrested him and
gave him his rights he couldn't read them?"
Axthelm went on to say that among the prob
lems that face college sports today he thinks
gambling "ranks about 98th on the list."
He then used the recent departure of Stan
ford Basketball Coach Tom Davis to elaborate
on his point.
"It's silly that a basketball coach who calls
himself a doctor is selling himself around be
cause he's complaining that the school won't
lower its admissions standards," Axthelm said.
"Once you start saying that Stanford can't
compete because it can't get (high school recruit
Chris) Munk, you start raising the question why
is Stanford here — for giving an education or
getting to the final four?"
Getting back to talking about the kind of per
son who gambles, Axthelm didn't see any clear
cut pattern.
"I think it's the type of person who likes ac
tion," he said. "But I don't think it's based on
personalities. I know real wackos" — he men
tioned one acquaintance who lies on his back in
front of the television and spreads his legs up in
the air like goalposts when he needs a team to
make a field goal to cover his bet — "and 1
know gamblers in three-piece suits."
