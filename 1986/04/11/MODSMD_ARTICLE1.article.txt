# Salvadoran finds refuge in Columbae
## 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A new "student" has moved into Columbae House.
But he wears dark glasses and a red bandana over his
mouth, he refuses to reveal his last name, and his only
class is an intensive study of the English language. He is
Herman, a refugee from the violence in El Salvador and
an illegal alien in the United States.
Herman said he left his family and his native countiy
four years ago after his brother and two friends were as
sassinated by government forces. "I left because of the
persecution and murders that were going on in
discriminately in my country," he said. "What I want to
do is stay here for a few years (until the war is over) and
then go back.
"I have a family in El Salvador, and so I wear the sun
glasses and bandana in order to protect them," Herman
said yesterday. "So [the Salvadoran government] can't
take revenge on my family."
On Monday, Columbae residents had declared their
residence a sanctuary for Latin American refugees and
yesterday they announced that their search for a resident
had ended with Herman.
"He's really a nice guy. The reaction in the house has
been very positive," Columbae resident Mike Tarpey
said. The house plans to shelter Herman indefinitely, al
though Tarpey said they will have to find Herman another
place to stay this summer when the building closes.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said the Univer
sity's response will be to "wait and see what happens."

A Salvadoran refugee, known only as Herman, found sanctuary in Columbae House yes
terday. House members say they will shelter Herman indefinitely, while University offi
cials have adopted a wait-and-see approach.
dean of Student Affairs and director
of the Row, Columbae residents
asked that the administration over
look a standard three-day limit on the
number of days a student may have a
guest in University housing.
Meanwhile, Herman was settling
into his new home on Columbae's
ground floor and practicing English
with his new housemates.
In an interview yesterday, Herman
praised the activism of American
citizens and called on the U.S. gov
ernment to alter its foreign policy in
Latin America.
"I feel in general the American
public is really conscious of what's
going on," Herman said through in
terpreter Amy Sobel, a Columbae
resident. "I think the students have
given that message to [refugees] in
having invited us to come and stay.
It's been a pleasure. The stance of the
students have been very favorable."
Herman said he lives with the fear
that U.S. officials may arrest and
deport him at any time. Refugees
"feel [officials] could grab anyone
and take them," he said. "It is the
fear of being deported, the fear of
being killed (by the government upon
returning to El Salvador)."

This wooden cross is part of a "graveyard" built yesterday in White
Plaza by members of Sanctuary at Stanford. According to its builders,
the graveyard symbolizes the deaths of Salvadorans killed by "death
squads'* in the country.
