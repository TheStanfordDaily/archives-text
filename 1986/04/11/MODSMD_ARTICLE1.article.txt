# Salvadoran finds refuge in Columbae
## 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A new "student" has moved into Columbae House.
But he wears dark glasses and a red bandana over his
mouth, he refuses to reveal his last name, and his only
class is an intensive study of the English language. He is
Herman, a refugee from the violence in El Salvador and
an illegal alien in the United States.
Herman said he left his family and his native countiy
four years ago after his brother and two friends were as
sassinated by government forces. "I left because of the
persecution and murders that were going on in
discriminately in my country," he said. "What I want to
do is stay here for a few years (until the war is over) and
then go back.
"I have a family in El Salvador, and so I wear the sun
glasses and bandana in order to protect them," Herman
said yesterday. "So [the Salvadoran government] can't
take revenge on my family."
On Monday, Columbae residents had declared their
residence a sanctuary for Latin American refugees and
yesterday they announced that their search for a resident
had ended with Herman.
"He's really a nice guy. The reaction in the house has
been very positive," Columbae resident Mike Tarpey
said. The house plans to shelter Herman indefinitely, al
though Tarpey said they will have to find Herman another
place to stay this summer when the building closes.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said the Univer
sity's response will be to "wait and see what happens."
