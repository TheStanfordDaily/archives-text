The debt is a responsibility that should be shared by the North, par
ticularly the United States and the South," Hortensia Allende said in a
speech here yesterday.
More than 100 people attended her presentation in CERAS about
foreign debt in Latin America.
Allende, the widow of murdered Chilean leader Salvador Allende, as
sessed the foreign debt as "an obstacle to growth in Latin America." She
said via an interpreter, "No nation can spend 50 percent of its national
budget (repaying loans) without going broke. Why should the people of
Latin America pay for debts created by governments they did not
elect?"
Currently, Latin America's foreign debt is about $20 billion plus $2
billion in annual interest charges, according to Allende. "Foreign debt
compromises the political integrity of the debtor country," she said.
She likened the role of the United States to that of a schoolyard bully,
saying, "America treats Latin American countries as a reliable ally
whom they must control but not help."
"We must learn to live together," she said regarding the U.S.-Latin
American relations.
Salvador Allende was overthrown in a 1973 coup headed by Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, purportedly with the assistance of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Aeencv.
Allende was scheduled to speak at Stanford in 1983. However, she
never appeared because "the State Department decided that (she) was
too much of a risk, and she was denied a visa," said Prof. Fernando
Alegria of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.
