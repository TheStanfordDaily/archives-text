## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Inaction invites violence 
### 
In the last two weeks, renewed protests at UC-
Berkeley against investment in companies which con
duct business with South Africa have led to over 140
arrests. This surge of activity is part of the ongoing
nationwide campaign for divestment. But what has
been unexpected is the violent nature of these protests.
In what may be seen as the turning point in the divest
ment movement, the usual peaceful demonstrations
have been replaced by increasingly physical confronta
tions, with violence coming from both sides. Protesters
have claimed that police, dressed in riot gear, over
reacted and beat students, while police charged that
protesters threw rocks at them.
Indeed, most of the media coverage and discussion
surrounding these events has focused primarily on the
violent aspect of the protests, particularly the violence
attributed to the students. This focus, however, only
serves to divert attention from the issties — the situa
tion in South Africa and the call for divestment — to a
debate over the protests themselves. It is more benefi
cial to examine why the protests have become more
confrontational.
It has been a year since the divestment movement
was revived on university campuses and throughout
the nation. But while apartheid continues in South
Africa, so do investments in corporations doing busi
ness with that country. Over the past year, more than
1,000 people in South Africa were killed in the streets
by police, over 50,000 children died of malnutrition
and blacks still may not vote or live and work where
they please. But in response to demands by students
for divestment— to help pressure South Africa to dis
mantle the system of apartheid — the regents of the

University of California system have merely set up an
advisory group on investments which has recom
mended that the university divest itself of stock in one
company. The UC system currently has $2.4 billion of
stock in companies which conduct business with South
Africa.
The students at Berkeley and elsewhere are becom
ing impatient with the lack of response and action on
the part of university administrations. Many univer
sities have refused to acknowledge the repeated calls
for divestment and economic sanctions from students,
black South Africans and even Bishop Desmond Tutu.
Despite the increased violence in South Africa, univer
sities have taken very few measures to change their in
vestment policies and help the situation in South
Africa. At Stanford, although students have repeatedly
showed their support for divestment, the University
still holds $158 million of stock in 80 companies doing
business in South Africa and has repeatedly abstained
from voting on shareholder resolutions to persuade
these companies to leave South Africa.
On April 2 of this year, Bishop Tutu said, "Our
children are dying, our land is burning and bleeding.
And so I call on the international community to apply
punitive sanctions against this government to help us
establish a new South Africa — nonracial, democratic,
participatory and just. This is a nonviolent strategy to
help us do so." Divestment is one part of this non
violent strategy. But the longer it takes for divestment
to occur — as we have seen at Berkeley — the greater
the possibility that the divestment campaigns will
become increasingly violent.
