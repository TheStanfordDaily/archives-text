# Beware biz school mindset

"Where to?" the cabbie said to the young man entering
the cab.
"67th and Park," the young man moaned, the sadness
enveloping his voice.
"Something wrong?" the cabbie asked, displaying the
therapist-like sensitivity that cabbies and bartenders are
known for.
"Yeah, something's wrong. I just got rejected from biz
school. All seven of them."
" Does that mean you wouldn't be a good business
man?" the cabbie inquired.
"Not at all," the young man retorted. "I was rejected
because my GMAT scores were too low and all that

means is that I'm a lousy test-taker. The sight of that
Scantron answer sheet sends my heart into palpitations
and my palms become so sweaty that I can hardly hold the
pencil to darken the little ovals."
" Digressing a bit," the cabbie asked, "why do you want
to go to business school anyway?"
"Well, I'm not sure what I want to do, but I do know
that an MBA would help me do it, whatever it is."
"Will business school teach you important skills that
you'll need in the business world?"
"Not really, but it'll give me what I need to succeed: the
degree. Without that you can't even join the party of big
time business. The graduate degree is the invitation and
without it there's no admittance to the party. They don't
let in just anyone."
"So, are you going to look for a job now ?"
"Yes. I plan to make a lot of money."
"Sounds like you should start your own business. I was
reading in the paper the other day that that's how most
Americans get rich. Thousands of people in the past de
cade or so have started businesses and created personal
fortunes. Sound good?"
"Not a chance. Starting your own business is too risky.
Why should I do that when I can take the safe and predict
able route to wealth: investment banking. My dad's in the
business, so I'll definitely be able to land a good job. After
two years at, say, Morgan Stanley, I'll be practically
assured of a spot in a top-flight biz school."

"But why go to biz school if all you want from it is an in
vitation to the party, when you'll already be at the party?"
"Because after biz school I could go back into invest
ment banking as an associate rather than an analyst and
make even more money than before, maybe $60,000-
$70,000 a year."
" Really? That's a lot of cash."
"Yes, I know,"the young man confidently responded.
"I hear that those investment banker fellas work pretty
long hours."
"Seventy-eighty hours a week, usually."
"You get overtime?" the cabbie inquired.
"No."
"No?" the cabbie puzzled, furrowing his brow and
making some quick calculations. "Then, on an hourly
basis, you're making about as much as my cousin Ernie.
He's a garbage man in Detroit."
"You can't even compare the two jobs," the young man
replied haughtily. "I'll be working on Wall Street, the fi
nancial capital of the world."
"What do those investment bankers really do anyway?
I've had a few of them in the cab but they're always so
busy reading that Wall Street Journal that we never get a
chance to talk."
"Investment bankers are a central cog in the function
ing of the economy, of the society itself, even. They —
soon of course I'll be able to say we — routinely arrange
multimillion dollar financing deals for the largest and
most powerful companies in the country, linking together
those that have money with those that need money, a
function crucial to the operation of the economy. That's
why they make so much money, because what they do is
so important."
"Sounds pretty high level," the cabbie responded, "but
I've never had a need for an investment banker myself, so
it's hard for me to see their usefulness."
"Usefulness!" the young man indignantly said. "I don't
think you can name any single profession more important
than investment banking."
"Well," the cabbie reflected, "I think my cousin Ernie
is in a pretty important line of work."
"You said he's a garbage man! How can you say that's
as important as investment banking!"
They sat silently for a few moments.
"I'm going to make big money on Wall Street," said the
young man as the cab pulled to the curb in front of his des
tination. He quickly got out.
"I hope so," the cabbie responded as he collected the
fare. "Maybe even as much as my cousin Ernie." The
young man turned abruptly and walked away.
