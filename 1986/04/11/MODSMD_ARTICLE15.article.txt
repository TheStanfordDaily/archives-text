## Men must recognize reality of rape danger 
### 
In conversation, the key words bring out the ex
pected reactions: "Oh, rape, that's awful." The
woman labeled "sort-of-a-feminist" (at least in the
men's minds) will make the most effective case; she
will cite some astounding statistics and on cue we
will all say. "Oh. that's terrible." At dinner some
one may unwittingly make a sexist remark and
most of the women will sharply criticize him: he
may or may not back down, but it is unlikely that
he'll say it again "in mixed company."'

But occasionally the supposed triteness of the
general subject of so-called "women's issues" such
as sexism, sexual assault and rape disappears when
the hypothetical and real events start to come close
to home. In Wednesday's Daily (April 9), I read
about the student who last Friday afternoon
allowed a man whom she met near Tresidder Un
ion to carry her books and walk her back to her
residence. Though upon arrival she asked him to
wait for her in the lobby, he followed her up to her
room and made physical advances. This "really
clean-cut" (as she described him) fellow sexually
assaulted her. After reading the account I sincerely
thought. "Oh wow. I can't believe it. That's awful
. . ." and put down my Daily and left it at that.
Around dinner-time that evening, a friend visit

ing my dorm room said that she had "had a bad
day"and that something "terrible" had happened
to her that day. I urged her to continue, but it took
her some time before she could tell me. Earlier in
the afternoon she had been checking her mail at
her post office box when a stranger approached
from behind, placing his hand high between her
legs and running it down. She turned around in
shock and he said, "I didn't touch your ass: 1
touched your inner thigh and it was fleshy." The in
cident seems to have affected her deeply.
Later that evening I heard about the Stanford
student who, last Thursday around 8 p.m. — ironi
cally, on her way to one of the opening classes of a
women's beginning self-defense seminar — was
knocked down on the reasonably well-lit lawn in
front of Meyer library by a man who began to
sexually assault her. She broke free and ran. arriv
ing at her self-defense class in tears.
Frankly, I am frightened. These recent accounts
are leading me to understand the reality of the dan
ger to women. What this means in practical terms is
simple. Stanford men. if women ask you to escort
them to or from any place on campus, you should
gladly agree, without being condescending. Women
who have considered asking a friend to walk with
them to some location but have been hesitant to do
so should feel free to ask: nor should anyone who
has been asked behave or feel as if it is any trouble.

The time, the stroll and the chat along the way are
well worth the investment.
However, it must be emphasized that depen
dence on friends for escorts or the SURE Escort
service can only be a preventative measure for the
short-run. Given the harsh reality of the situation,
women should consider women's self-defense and
assertion classes a must, not a luxury. In that way,
the idea that women are the weaker sex and cannot
fend for themselves — and therefore make the per
fect victims — cannot be perpetuated. Stanford's
women's self-defense classes have only been able
to accommodate less than one-third of the interested
women: more classes should be made available in
upcoming quarters.
Nonetheless, keep in mind that the majority of
rapes are acquaintance rapes — rapes by friends or
someone you know. That is why men must examine
and change their attitudes as well. It is neither a
liberal nor a conservative issue: men must rethink
their own attitudes so that women can be safer. The
sexist remarks may be suppressed in mixed com
pany. or suppressed altogether, but it is the sexist
attitudes which ultimately find some outlet. I hope
that the man who assaulted my friend in front of
the post office reads this and feels shame; his action
was not "harmless," but an example which reveals
why all men must become more conscious of their
attitudes towards women.

simple. Stanford men. if women ask you to escort
them to or from any place on campus, you should
gladly agree, without being condescending. Women
who have considered asking a friend to walk with
them to some location but have been hesitant to do
so should feel free to ask: nor should anyone who
has been asked behave or feel as if it is any trouble.

The time, the stroll and the chat along the way are
well worth the investment.
However, it must be emphasized that depen
dence on friends for escorts or the SURE Escort
service can only be a preventative measure for the
short-run. Given the harsh reality of the situation,
women should consider women's self-defense and
assertion classes a must, not a luxury. In that way,
the idea that women are the weaker sex and cannot
fend for themselves — and therefore make the per
fect victims — cannot be perpetuated. Stanford's
women's self-defense classes have only been able
to accommodate less than one-third of the interested
women: more classes should be made available in
upcoming quarters.
Nonetheless, keep in mind that the majority of
rapes are acquaintance rapes — rapes by friends or
someone you know. That is why men must examine
and change their attitudes as well. It is neither a
liberal nor a conservative issue: men must rethink
their own attitudes so that women can be safer. The
sexist remarks may be suppressed in mixed com
pany. or suppressed altogether, but it is the sexist
attitudes which ultimately find some outlet. I hope
that the man who assaulted my friend in front of
the post office reads this and feels shame; his action
was not "harmless," but an example which reveals
why all men must become more conscious of their
attitudes towards women.
