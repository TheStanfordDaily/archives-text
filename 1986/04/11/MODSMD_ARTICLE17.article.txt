Kennedy response
was inappropriate
I am concerned about University
President Donald Kennedy's
response to Prof. John Manley's
criticisms on the Hoover Institution
issue. The derisive and petulant tone
of Kennedy's comments seems to me
to be unprofessional and not consis
tent with the dignity of the office of
president of Stanford.
Moreover, Kennedy states that
Manley provided no evidence of alle
gations relating to Stanford's anti
union posture. Kennedy knows full
well the details of Stanford's anti
union role. As I have pointed out on
countless occasions for the past five
or six years, Stanford has skirted the
law, at a minimum, and exploited
pure legal technicalities to discredit
and divide the United Stanford
Workers. Our university and our na
tion ought to be striving for more
cooperative relationships between
labor and management. Stanford's
emulation of employer conduct which
represents the lowest common
denominator on the labor scene un
dercuts that objective.
Finally, Kennedy berates Manley
for not discussing the Hoover matter
privately. Sixteen months ago Ken
nedy suggested that he would be in
terested in my ideas about the rela
tionship between the University and
companies that hold stock in South
Africa. I sent him a fairly detailed
memorandum in January 1985 and a
follow-up memo in February 1986. I
have never had the courtesy of a
response from Kennedy or his repre
sentatives, let alone a dialogue. Does
Manley know something about the
president's office that I didn't?

Behavior of frats
infringes on rights
I am writing this letter in response
to Luke Cole's viewpoint of April 4
("Greek system is indefensible") re
garding fraternities, specifically the
Delta Upsilon (DU) house. 1 have
just left the DU house after boarding
there during fall and winter quarters,
and I feel that I should underline the
pessimistic picture that Cole paints of

one of Stanford's more popular fra
ternities, regardless of his motive for
doing so. Having decided to write this
letter, I apologize to the house mem
bers who don't warrant these
criticisms.
I can't be sure that my criticisms
should be generalized to the frater
nity system in general, but I suspect
that they can.
During fall quarter I happened to
hear a member of the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) discussing with the
house president the probationary
status of the house. One of the IFC's
requests was that the DUs should try
to communicate the message of what
they stood for to the Stanford com
munity. That request struck me as
both naive from the IFC's point of
view and irrelevant from the DU's.
What the DUs and most fraternities
stand for should not be commun
icated to the Stanford community at
any cost, and in the DU's case, should
be kept a guarded secret.
Come on guys, be serious. Do you
honestly think you have anything
legitimate to offer an institution like
Stanford, which prides itself on values
such as tolerance, diversity and pro
viding an intellectually stimulating
environment for those of us who were
fortunate enough to get in?
In my six-month stay at the house I
didn't see anything that came close to
achieving these sort of ends, and I
doubt any of the members would
claim that the house tries to portray
these sorts of values — and why
should they? We live in a free
country, after all, and if Stanford
wants to uphold its claim of diversity,
why shouldn't homogenous cliques
like the DUs be allowed to exist
alongside other such groups as the
theme houses? In a free country don't
we still maintain the right to hold
sexist or racist views, and isn't this
just one of penalties we must pay for
freedom? Yes, indeed; so rather than
criticize the DUs for being a sexist,
elitist, racist clique, I am more con
cerned with criticizing them for the
way in which they infringe on the
rights of others both inside and
outside the fraternity. The DUs have
every right in a free society to hold
sexist, elitist and racist views. What
they don't have a right to is their bla
tant disregard for other people's
property, by which I refer to the end
less series of thefts and vandalism
that take place weekly, if not daily,

around the house — the sort of acts
that go beyond urinating on
Columbae's flower beds or stealing
street signs; the sort of acts that get
less privileged members of society put
away.
Inside the house, individuals' rights
are infringed upon in a more subtle,
legitimate manner. There is little or
no room for individualism in a group
in which the power of peer pressure
to conform to DU "idealism" is so
strong.
Not only is it possible to become
isolated from the rest of the Stanford
community in such an atmosphere,
but also, I fear, one is in danger of be
coming isolated from oneself in the
sea of conformity which I witnessed
at the house.
I'm sure that most of the house
members will move on to successful
careers after they have finished with
Stanford. And, indeed, most of them
will go on to hold responsible posi
tions in the world at large — a dis
comforting thought. Sooner or later
they'll grow up, so why not start now
like the rest of us?
With rush upon us, my message to
potential rushees is that yes, you will
get to meet plenty of cute girls, and to
party as much as you like, but is it
really worth it? My message to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
and the rest of the IFC is "wise up."

As Editor of The ASSU News, I
am, obviously, responsible for every
thing that goes on the page. In Wed
nesday's (April 9) issue, "The ASSU
Blues," I not only made a grievous
mistake, but I truly erred in my judg
ment.
I in no way wished to offend
anybody by the banner of the blues
singer, but as I look at it now, I see
that there is no way that it couldn't be
construed as racist. The bottom line is
that I was just plain wrong and 1
apologize not only to the readers of
th£ News but also to those associated
with its production. While I truly
regret that this incoasiderate and ig
norant racist presentation occurred, I
hope that I have learned something
from this experience as well.

As Editor of The ASSU News, I
am, obviously, responsible for every
thing that goes on the page. In Wed
nesday's (April 9) issue, "The ASSU
Blues," I not only made a grievous
mistake, but I truly erred in my judg
ment.
I in no way wished to offend
anybody by the banner of the blues
singer, but as I look at it now, I see
that there is no way that it couldn't be
construed as racist. The bottom line is
that I was just plain wrong and 1
apologize not only to the readers of
th£ News but also to those associated
with its production. While I truly
regret that this incoasiderate and ig
norant racist presentation occurred, I
hope that I have learned something
from this experience as well.

Kennedy response
was inappropriate
I am concerned about University
President Donald Kennedy's
response to Prof. John Manley's
criticisms on the Hoover Institution
issue. The derisive and petulant tone
of Kennedy's comments seems to me
to be unprofessional and not consis
tent with the dignity of the office of
president of Stanford.
Moreover, Kennedy states that
Manley provided no evidence of alle
gations relating to Stanford's anti
union posture. Kennedy knows full
well the details of Stanford's anti
union role. As I have pointed out on
countless occasions for the past five
or six years, Stanford has skirted the
law, at a minimum, and exploited
pure legal technicalities to discredit
and divide the United Stanford
Workers. Our university and our na
tion ought to be striving for more
cooperative relationships between
labor and management. Stanford's
emulation of employer conduct which
represents the lowest common
denominator on the labor scene un
dercuts that objective.
Finally, Kennedy berates Manley
for not discussing the Hoover matter
privately. Sixteen months ago Ken
nedy suggested that he would be in
terested in my ideas about the rela
tionship between the University and
companies that hold stock in South
Africa. I sent him a fairly detailed
memorandum in January 1985 and a
follow-up memo in February 1986. I
have never had the courtesy of a
response from Kennedy or his repre
sentatives, let alone a dialogue. Does
Manley know something about the
president's office that I didn't?

Behavior of frats
infringes on rights
I am writing this letter in response
to Luke Cole's viewpoint of April 4
("Greek system is indefensible") re
garding fraternities, specifically the
Delta Upsilon (DU) house. 1 have
just left the DU house after boarding
there during fall and winter quarters,
and I feel that I should underline the
pessimistic picture that Cole paints of

one of Stanford's more popular fra
ternities, regardless of his motive for
doing so. Having decided to write this
letter, I apologize to the house mem
bers who don't warrant these
criticisms.
I can't be sure that my criticisms
should be generalized to the frater
nity system in general, but I suspect
that they can.
During fall quarter I happened to
hear a member of the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) discussing with the
house president the probationary
status of the house. One of the IFC's
requests was that the DUs should try
to communicate the message of what
they stood for to the Stanford com
munity. That request struck me as
both naive from the IFC's point of
view and irrelevant from the DU's.
What the DUs and most fraternities
stand for should not be commun
icated to the Stanford community at
any cost, and in the DU's case, should
be kept a guarded secret.
Come on guys, be serious. Do you
honestly think you have anything
legitimate to offer an institution like
Stanford, which prides itself on values
such as tolerance, diversity and pro
viding an intellectually stimulating
environment for those of us who were
fortunate enough to get in?
In my six-month stay at the house I
didn't see anything that came close to
achieving these sort of ends, and I
doubt any of the members would
claim that the house tries to portray
these sorts of values — and why
should they? We live in a free
country, after all, and if Stanford
wants to uphold its claim of diversity,
why shouldn't homogenous cliques
like the DUs be allowed to exist
alongside other such groups as the
theme houses? In a free country don't
we still maintain the right to hold
sexist or racist views, and isn't this
just one of penalties we must pay for
freedom? Yes, indeed; so rather than
criticize the DUs for being a sexist,
elitist, racist clique, I am more con
cerned with criticizing them for the
way in which they infringe on the
rights of others both inside and
outside the fraternity. The DUs have
every right in a free society to hold
sexist, elitist and racist views. What
they don't have a right to is their bla
tant disregard for other people's
property, by which I refer to the end
less series of thefts and vandalism
that take place weekly, if not daily,

around the house — the sort of acts
that go beyond urinating on
Columbae's flower beds or stealing
street signs; the sort of acts that get
less privileged members of society put
away.
Inside the house, individuals' rights
are infringed upon in a more subtle,
legitimate manner. There is little or
no room for individualism in a group
in which the power of peer pressure
to conform to DU "idealism" is so
strong.
Not only is it possible to become
isolated from the rest of the Stanford
community in such an atmosphere,
but also, I fear, one is in danger of be
coming isolated from oneself in the
sea of conformity which I witnessed
at the house.
I'm sure that most of the house
members will move on to successful
careers after they have finished with
Stanford. And, indeed, most of them
will go on to hold responsible posi
tions in the world at large — a dis
comforting thought. Sooner or later
they'll grow up, so why not start now
like the rest of us?
With rush upon us, my message to
potential rushees is that yes, you will
get to meet plenty of cute girls, and to
party as much as you like, but is it
really worth it? My message to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
and the rest of the IFC is "wise up."
