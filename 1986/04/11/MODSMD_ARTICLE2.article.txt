# Shanty damaged by morning fire
## 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Fire singed the White Plaza shanty
early yesterday morning, partially
destroying one cardboard wall while
leaving the wood frame and cor
rugated metal roof intact.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said an anonymous caller re
ported the fire at 2:57 a.m. Police put
out the blaze with fire extinguishers
and canceled a call to the Palo Alto
Fire Department.
The fire was apparently set
"without an accelerant" at the bot
tom of two sides of the shanty, Her
rington said. No one was in the
vicinity when officers arrived, and
police said they have not identified
any suspects.
It was the second time that the
shanty, rebuilt Tuesday by anti
apartheid demonstrators to symbolize
black living conditions in South
Africa, has been struck by vandals.
An incident in the early hours of Feb.
7 left the original wooden shanty in
ruins, and a reinforced structure was
razed by a storm a week later.
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) member Mike Schmitz said
the incident is "another example of
the kind of forces we're ,up against,
another example (of the opposition)
that — be it from the right, the
(Stanford) administration or the
South African government — we find
ourselves faced with."

Herrington said police were
"keeping an eye on [the shanty] as
best we could" and had last patrolled
the area between 1:30 and 1:45 a.m.
SOSA members said the shack was
unoccupied yesterday morning.
Group members had said Wednesday
that they would constantly occupy the
shanty to deter vandals and answer
questions about the purpose of the
structure.
In a written statement on the inci
dent, Dean of Student Affairs Affairs
James Lyons said the incident
"should at least be seen as an affront
to the value this community places on
free speech — a value that is essential
to a free society and keystone for this
and any academic community.
"The symbolism of the 'shanty' is
an important way of physically con
veying the despair of daily lives for
blacks iri South Africa," Lyons wrote.
"I think that we should all be ap
palled that in a sophisticated environ
ment like Stanford, there could be
someone who has so little under
standing of our principles of free
speech that they are fearful of making
their point for all to see or hear, and
to take responsibility for their views.
"And I'm more than a little
troubled that someone should turn to
arson as a means to avoid the realities
that the 'shanty' represents," he said.
James Rosse, University vice presi
dent and provost, called the incident
"deporable and cowardly" and wrote
in a statement: "The shanty
represents the conditions under
which most black South Africans live.
Those on campus who care about the
immoral treatment of the South
African blacks had a right here to
state their views. The shanty is such a
statement."
SOSA plans to repair the latest
shanty "very soon," but for now will
leave the charred shack as a reminder
of the living conditions of South
African blacks and the opposition the
divestment movement here faces, ac
cording to Schmitz.
SOSA member Catherine Atkin
said the incident may have been a
result of opposition to a referendum
on the ballot for next week's ASSU
election. If passed, the referendum
would recommend withdrawing
ASSU money from a merged Univer
sity pool that includes investments in
companies doing business in South
Africa.
"You'd think if people were
against the referendum, they
wouldn't do something like this. [The
fire] just adds to our cause," Atkin
said.
While University officials have not
interfered with any of the shanties,
some administrators expressed con
cern that other student groups may

want to use White Plaza, and worried
about the safety of protesters and the
health of the lawn under the
structure.
"After the last shantytown was
vandalized in February, we spoke to a
couple of students involved and asked
them to think about alternative sites
so that if they rebuilt it, grounds and

maintenance crews would still be able
to water and mow the grass," said Mi
chael Ramsey-Perez, coordinator of
Student Organization Services.
He said that he and student
protesters "are trying to arrange a
meeting so that we can come to an
agreement with Grounds and
Services."

Ramsey-Perez added that he is
concerned about the safety of stu
dents who sometimes sit or sleep in
the shanty. "If students treat this as a
display not meant for inhabitation,
then we don't have to worry about
complying with local building and
health codes," he said. "Students
should not and cannot sleep in it."

The White Plaza shanty was damaged by fire early yesterday morning, just two days after it had been rebuilt
by members of Stanford Out of South Africa. In February, the shanty was vandalized, rebuilt and destroyed
by a storm.
