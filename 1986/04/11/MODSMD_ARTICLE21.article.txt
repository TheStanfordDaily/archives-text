## Don't get short with me 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
Isn't it wonderful that clothing manufacturers have
made psychedelic drugs practically obsolete with this
year's new summer wardrobe?
I hadn't even noticed their amazing addition to the
family of mind-altering substances until I was
sideswiped by a veritable Taco Bell Grande of
Guernica-shaped colors whistling "La Cucaracha"
through the spokes of a Schwinn cruiser the other day.
"Wha' thuh?" I managed to keep my footing, but I
almost glottalized a kamikaze caterpillar as it prepared
a slow three-pointer on my tastebuds.
If Huey Lewis ever met this hit-and-run hallucina

tion, he would make one scary
song out of it. KRQR would prob
ably never stop playing it.
Sanity took over soon enough,
though, soothing me in its mayon
naise Ed Bartles tones: "Now,
here at Ernest and Julio, we do
not usually get involved in passing
trends; but Ed here thought it
would be a good idea to show the
younger crowd that Bartles and
Jaymes is not just for the older
fine wine cooler connoisseur. And
so, in the interest of crass com
merciality, we are wearing these
colorful bloomers from Maui and
Sons. What's that, Ed? They
aren't bloomers? Well, I surely do
feel a lot less silly. There you have
it, folks. And thank you for your
support."

Yeah, picture sanity wearing
post-psilocybin-tacky-tourist shorts over its albino
white kneecaps, rocking on the front porch of your
brain. That's what it's like in my skull, at least, which is
why I get flustered so easily by Lite Brite colors.
Actually, I think they plagiarized some of those
geometric designs I used to create with chewable
multi-vitamin-sized pellets of colored plastic and used
them for their abbreviated, non-polyester-version gol
fing duds (all good things in modern Western civiliza
tion being pressed out of colored plastic in some form
or other.)
Come to think of it, this column isn't really about
any clothing style I may seem to be talking about, or
about plastic, and it's not even about any of the other
wonderful things I'll also mention soon: it's all just a
ploy, an exercise in hyphenation, an I-can-get-into
the-Guiness-Book-of-World-Records-before-you-can
Tom Wolfian hubris.
Yes, this column is about words, or rather the spaces
between words which we overlook until they're filled

with the discarded razor stubble of so many Atra com
mercials— hyphens. S-o-t-h-e-r-e.
Which is another thing I want to tillk about today.
Some of my closest friends have been telling me how I
look like the poster from "Eraserhead" and then they
recite this really pointless movie plot for me.
Just so I never have to listen to this synopsis again,
let's get it straight that 1 don't look exactly like 1 look
here. That is, this three-inch version of me isn't
supposed to resemble my 5-foot-3 version very much.
In fact. 1 think 1 look much better here than 1 do wher
ever I am now, so you should be glad you're reading
this.
The Daily's graphics department sent many an il
lustrious doodler to capture the strange meanderings

of my features (which, strangely
enough, resemble the meander
ings of my writing) but they all
either shriveled up and turned
into small curd cottage cheese at
the idea or produced heaps of
little pink eraser shards, but no
likable likenesses. Maybe that's
where the "Eraserhead" com
ments started..
I just have a face that is thus far
unreproducable, thank goodness.
So I'd like to pose a few ques
tions to the new Daily cartoonist,
who will waft around in the ethers
until Monday, at which time
Scotty will beam him or her down,
the all-knowing guru-editor will
free the genie by breaking the
pop-top seal on the Diet Coke
can, and the cosmic knife will take
the first dollop out of the purple

Pandora's box of peanut butter pleasure:
First, can you pronounce Hyundai.
Second, do you wear shorts that are louder than the
average Twisted Sister concert?
Third, do you think my face looks like Yogi the Bear
or Darth Vader? More importantly, would you ever
draw it that way?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, be
sure to stay out of asparagus-spearing range of me.
Others of my dear friends have commented that they
like the pedestals, but that they do seem a bit
presumptuous.
You see, they're ionic columns, and the lopsided
Grecian urn on top of them is my columnist aspect, and
all this grey stuff surrounding them is a column. If you
made it through all those hazy layers, congratulations.
You're now in the inner sanctum, a carbonated,
carburetor-like concoction of pea soup consistency
that comes with a handy draw-string closure and needs
no ironing, just like some pairs of shorts I've met.

aren't bloomers? Well, I surely do
feel a lot less silly. There you have
it, folks. And thank you for your
support."

Yeah, picture sanity wearing
post-psilocybin-tacky-tourist shorts over its albino
white kneecaps, rocking on the front porch of your
brain. That's what it's like in my skull, at least, which is
why I get flustered so easily by Lite Brite colors.
Actually, I think they plagiarized some of those
geometric designs I used to create with chewable
multi-vitamin-sized pellets of colored plastic and used
them for their abbreviated, non-polyester-version gol
fing duds (all good things in modern Western civiliza
tion being pressed out of colored plastic in some form
or other.)
Come to think of it, this column isn't really about
any clothing style I may seem to be talking about, or
about plastic, and it's not even about any of the other
wonderful things I'll also mention soon: it's all just a
ploy, an exercise in hyphenation, an I-can-get-into
the-Guiness-Book-of-World-Records-before-you-can
Tom Wolfian hubris.
Yes, this column is about words, or rather the spaces
between words which we overlook until they're filled

with the discarded razor stubble of so many Atra com
mercials— hyphens. S-o-t-h-e-r-e.
Which is another thing I want to tillk about today.
Some of my closest friends have been telling me how I
look like the poster from "Eraserhead" and then they
recite this really pointless movie plot for me.
Just so I never have to listen to this synopsis again,
let's get it straight that 1 don't look exactly like 1 look
here. That is, this three-inch version of me isn't
supposed to resemble my 5-foot-3 version very much.
In fact. 1 think 1 look much better here than 1 do wher
ever I am now, so you should be glad you're reading
this.
The Daily's graphics department sent many an il
lustrious doodler to capture the strange meanderings

of my features (which, strangely
enough, resemble the meander
ings of my writing) but they all
either shriveled up and turned
into small curd cottage cheese at
the idea or produced heaps of
little pink eraser shards, but no
likable likenesses. Maybe that's
where the "Eraserhead" com
ments started..
I just have a face that is thus far
unreproducable, thank goodness.
So I'd like to pose a few ques
tions to the new Daily cartoonist,
who will waft around in the ethers
until Monday, at which time
Scotty will beam him or her down,
the all-knowing guru-editor will
free the genie by breaking the
pop-top seal on the Diet Coke
can, and the cosmic knife will take
the first dollop out of the purple

Pandora's box of peanut butter pleasure:
First, can you pronounce Hyundai.
Second, do you wear shorts that are louder than the
average Twisted Sister concert?
Third, do you think my face looks like Yogi the Bear
or Darth Vader? More importantly, would you ever
draw it that way?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, be
sure to stay out of asparagus-spearing range of me.
Others of my dear friends have commented that they
like the pedestals, but that they do seem a bit
presumptuous.
You see, they're ionic columns, and the lopsided
Grecian urn on top of them is my columnist aspect, and
all this grey stuff surrounding them is a column. If you
made it through all those hazy layers, congratulations.
You're now in the inner sanctum, a carbonated,
carburetor-like concoction of pea soup consistency
that comes with a handy draw-string closure and needs
no ironing, just like some pairs of shorts I've met.

Isn't it wonderful that clothing manufacturers have
made psychedelic drugs practically obsolete with this
year's new summer wardrobe?
I hadn't even noticed their amazing addition to the
family of mind-altering substances until I was
sideswiped by a veritable Taco Bell Grande of
Guernica-shaped colors whistling "La Cucaracha"
through the spokes of a Schwinn cruiser the other day.
"Wha' thuh?" I managed to keep my footing, but I
almost glottalized a kamikaze caterpillar as it prepared
a slow three-pointer on my tastebuds.
If Huey Lewis ever met this hit-and-run hallucina

tion, he would make one scary
song out of it. KRQR would prob
ably never stop playing it.
Sanity took over soon enough,
though, soothing me in its mayon
naise Ed Bartles tones: "Now,
here at Ernest and Julio, we do
not usually get involved in passing
trends; but Ed here thought it
would be a good idea to show the
younger crowd that Bartles and
Jaymes is not just for the older
fine wine cooler connoisseur. And
so, in the interest of crass com
merciality, we are wearing these
colorful bloomers from Maui and
Sons. What's that, Ed? They
aren't bloomers? Well, I surely do
feel a lot less silly. There you have
it, folks. And thank you for your
support."
