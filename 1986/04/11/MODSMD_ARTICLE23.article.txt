We're not ragging on this record to get back at
Frank Lester for his Daily article a month ago
saying KZSU went "gaga" over "Around the
World in a Day." And so what if we did go gaga,
anyway? At least half its songs were good and a
couple were even great. The other half were attrac
tive enough at first listen — until sensationalism
and beat gave way to the realization that melodies
and concept had been forsaken.
Unfortunately, "Parade" is everything bad about
"Around the World." Songs without melodies (just
TRY to sing "Kiss" in the shower); songs so
stretched that by their end it's hard to remember
their beginning; music so minimalized that crucial
instruments, chords and phrases are left out.
Prince goes immediately from screaming
melody-barren beatfunk to crooning slow, Sinatra
style ballads (which are better played at 78 rpm, by
the way), making for what must be the most dis
jointed record of the decade.
What makes "Parade" so ultimately irritating,
though, is not the finger cymbals, the quirky
baritone sax, or the lack of smokin' Hendrix guitar
so much as the band's attitude. Having defined
"cool" for naive teenagers since "Purple Rain," the
bandmembers ('specially the Kid himself) assume
they continue to do so, despite the fact that they do
not.
Prince sings about his "character" in his upcom
ing movie, wails, pouts, and screams (we'd rather
hear Lisa's and Wendy's nails on a chalkboard,
thanks just the same) throughout, expecting us to
still care.
The record isn't completely merit-free, however.
Just as you're ready to give up on it, you hear
something that cooks and temporarily restores your
confidence and enjoyment quotient. These are

usually the danceable songs; the ones with all the
vital instruments and a minimum of simpy lyrics.
Besides, they kinda grow on you — and you'll only
hear them 40 jillion times on the radio.
And heck, the rich instrumentation (slow songs
only) isn't always hokey and overblown. But for the
most part, this just isn't the record for which we've
waited 10 whole months. Maybe next time our
heroic Revolutionaries will take a bit more time to
figure out what they want to do before they plunge
into it, so their audience doesn't get stuck with an
other obvious Royal All-Nighter.

In the tradition of Depeche's past albums,
"Black Celebration" is lead singer-songwriter Mar
tin Gore's latest installment in a saga of decline and
depression. He can only celebrate "the fact/That
we've seen the back/Of another black day." In his
world, " Death is everywhere. .. . There are flies on
the windscreen/There are lambs for the slaughter."
With this album, however, Gore abandons any
semblance of hope exhibited in previous albums,
even leaving behind the communist themes of "Get
the Balance Right" and the stellar "Construction
Time Again."
Musically, the record is true to Depeche Mode's
industrial techno-pop sound. Song constructions
are still simple, but they're losing the tremendous
pop hook that great songs like "People Are
People" and "Everything Counts" had.
Repetition, once a well-developed tool for their
music, weakens several songs. A few songs,
however, are strong enough to be reminiscent of
earlier successes. "But Not Tonight," "New
Dress" and "A Question of Lust" approach their
best material, but on their previous albums they
would be only mediocre cuts. Still, the band just
might get a couple of hits out of "Black Celebra
tion."

Robyn Hitchcock's name sounds like a bastar
dization of a "60s TV show, but on this live effort he
delivers the goods. Along with the preceding album
"Fegmania," Hitchcock provides for a continually
entertaining and surprising experience.
Hitchcock, along with Katrina and the Waves'
Kimberly Rew, was an original member of Britain's
Softboys, an early punk progenitor of the psyche
delia/paisley revival.
Hitchcock has been unjustly overlooked. His in
fluence on many strains of contemporary new wave
music is readily apparent from The Three O'Clock
to the Bangles and the Waterboys. What makes
Hitchcock so different, and therefore relatively less
popular, are his quirky and unpredictable lyrics.
His topics of interest are far from ordinary: "My
Wife and My Dead Wife," a necrophilian menage a
trois, and "Acid Bird," ("Sometimes I wish I was a
pretty girl so I could wreck myself in the shower.")
The sound he creates is a brilliant mix of heady pop
interspersed with some great guitar.
"We Gotta Let This Hen Out" is a very well
thought-out live effort. It assembles many of
Hitchcock's gems from his work with the Softboys
to the present.
After catching him live last month at the
Berkeley Square, I realized just how much talent
this man has. Hitchcock's vision, while definitely
off, is infectious in person; his show was one of the
most continually entertaining and surprising of any
I have seen in the last five years.
Most live albums are either sheer corporate
profit-taking or artist time-buying; "Hen" is a live
record with a purpose. It is a successful addition to
the catalog of Hitchcock's triumphs.

saying KZSU went "gaga" over "Around the
World in a Day." And so what if we did go gaga,
anyway? At least half its songs were good and a
couple were even great. The other half were attrac
tive enough at first listen — until sensationalism
and beat gave way to the realization that melodies
and concept had been forsaken.
Unfortunately, "Parade" is everything bad about
"Around the World." Songs without melodies (just
TRY to sing "Kiss" in the shower); songs so
stretched that by their end it's hard to remember
their beginning; music so minimalized that crucial
instruments, chords and phrases are left out.
Prince goes immediately from screaming
melody-barren beatfunk to crooning slow, Sinatra
style ballads (which are better played at 78 rpm, by
the way), making for what must be the most dis
jointed record of the decade.
What makes "Parade" so ultimately irritating,
though, is not the finger cymbals, the quirky
baritone sax, or the lack of smokin' Hendrix guitar
so much as the band's attitude. Having defined
"cool" for naive teenagers since "Purple Rain," the
bandmembers ('specially the Kid himself) assume
they continue to do so, despite the fact that they do
not.
Prince sings about his "character" in his upcom
ing movie, wails, pouts, and screams (we'd rather
hear Lisa's and Wendy's nails on a chalkboard,
thanks just the same) throughout, expecting us to
still care.
The record isn't completely merit-free, however.
Just as you're ready to give up on it, you hear
something that cooks and temporarily restores your
confidence and enjoyment quotient. These are

usually the danceable songs; the ones with all the
vital instruments and a minimum of simpy lyrics.
Besides, they kinda grow on you — and you'll only
hear them 40 jillion times on the radio.
And heck, the rich instrumentation (slow songs
only) isn't always hokey and overblown. But for the
most part, this just isn't the record for which we've
waited 10 whole months. Maybe next time our
heroic Revolutionaries will take a bit more time to
figure out what they want to do before they plunge
into it, so their audience doesn't get stuck with an
other obvious Royal All-Nighter.

In the tradition of Depeche's past albums,
"Black Celebration" is lead singer-songwriter Mar
tin Gore's latest installment in a saga of decline and
depression. He can only celebrate "the fact/That
we've seen the back/Of another black day." In his
world, " Death is everywhere. .. . There are flies on
the windscreen/There are lambs for the slaughter."
With this album, however, Gore abandons any
semblance of hope exhibited in previous albums,
even leaving behind the communist themes of "Get
the Balance Right" and the stellar "Construction
Time Again."
Musically, the record is true to Depeche Mode's
industrial techno-pop sound. Song constructions
are still simple, but they're losing the tremendous
pop hook that great songs like "People Are
People" and "Everything Counts" had.
Repetition, once a well-developed tool for their
music, weakens several songs. A few songs,
however, are strong enough to be reminiscent of
earlier successes. "But Not Tonight," "New
Dress" and "A Question of Lust" approach their
best material, but on their previous albums they
would be only mediocre cuts. Still, the band just
might get a couple of hits out of "Black Celebra
tion."

Robyn Hitchcock's name sounds like a bastar
dization of a "60s TV show, but on this live effort he
delivers the goods. Along with the preceding album
"Fegmania," Hitchcock provides for a continually
entertaining and surprising experience.
Hitchcock, along with Katrina and the Waves'
Kimberly Rew, was an original member of Britain's
Softboys, an early punk progenitor of the psyche
delia/paisley revival.
Hitchcock has been unjustly overlooked. His in
fluence on many strains of contemporary new wave
music is readily apparent from The Three O'Clock
to the Bangles and the Waterboys. What makes
Hitchcock so different, and therefore relatively less
popular, are his quirky and unpredictable lyrics.
His topics of interest are far from ordinary: "My
Wife and My Dead Wife," a necrophilian menage a
trois, and "Acid Bird," ("Sometimes I wish I was a
pretty girl so I could wreck myself in the shower.")
The sound he creates is a brilliant mix of heady pop
interspersed with some great guitar.
"We Gotta Let This Hen Out" is a very well
thought-out live effort. It assembles many of
Hitchcock's gems from his work with the Softboys
to the present.
After catching him live last month at the
Berkeley Square, I realized just how much talent
this man has. Hitchcock's vision, while definitely
off, is infectious in person; his show was one of the
most continually entertaining and surprising of any
I have seen in the last five years.
Most live albums are either sheer corporate
profit-taking or artist time-buying; "Hen" is a live
record with a purpose. It is a successful addition to
the catalog of Hitchcock's triumphs.
