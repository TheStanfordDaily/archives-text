# 'Cherry Orchard' blossoms in Eureka production
## 
### PETER MORGAN Senior staff writer 
"The Cherry Orchard," written by
Anton Chekhov in 1904, is consid
ered one of the greatest plays of all
time, ranking with "Hamlet" and
"Oedipus Rex" as a landmark in both
theatrical and literary traditions. And
like most "classics," Chekhov's plays
are often regarded as "period
pieces," interesting for their style but
not very entertaining to a "modern
audience."
The common man sees Chekhov in
about the same way he sees Shake
speare: a classic writer everyone
knows but few enjoy. Most "experts"
agree, though, that this image of the
Greeks, Shakespeare, Chekhov and
other "greats" is not the fault of the
authors, but of the ill-equipped com
panies that attempt to produce them.
It's not that good productions don't
exist, it's just that they are few and far
between.
Happily, the Eureka Theater's
recent opening of "The Cherry Or
chard" is one of the elite. In fact, it is
one of the most exciting shows I have
seen this year.
The play focuses on a period of
transition in Russian history between
the relaxed, leisurely era of the
landed aristocracy and the more ex
uberant, energetic one of the
capitalist and communist. The play
presents Madame Ranevsky and her
brother as representatives of the old
guard, and shows how their lives
chartge when they are forced to auc

tion their estate and cherry orchard in
order to survive economically.
Money lurks behind all the events
of the play, in fact, whether it is in the
form of the exuberant capitalist
Lopakhin or the critical student
Trofimov (an early socialist). Many
productions prefer to ignore the base
ness of the money topic in favor of
the more poetical topics that focus on
the mood of sentimental lament for
an age gone by.
The many love intrigues in the play
offer another attractive alternative to
"money matters". While this type of
production emphasizes the moods,
hopes and ambitions of Chekhov's
characters, it forgets that these char
acters also worry about the "trivial"
issues of life just as much. And thus
all too often seeing a Chekhov play
means watching a show with lots of
pauses emphasizing the famous

"subtext of silence" which Chekhov
is known for, pauses which are meant
to capture the tension of their
"boredom." Unfortunately, watching
actors being bored is boring.
So why the spiel on all this? Well,
it's just a matter of saying what a lot
of people may expect or have experi
enced with Chekhov isn't necessarily
what he's all about. In the Eureka's
production we are given a opportu
nity to see Chekhov done as a vital,
energetic playwright whose observa
tions about people are as engrossing
today as they were at the turn of the
century. It isn't a perfect show, but
the minor elements it misses in sur
mounting the obstacles that Chekhov
presents are forgettable.
What are these obstacles? First,
getting a 14-person cast with depth.
There are no cardboard characters in
Chekhov, particularly in "The Cherry

Orchard," since there is no true
central character. Balance amongst
the cast means confidence all around,
even for the maids. The Eureka's cast
is solid for the most part, and has
riveting performances by Steven
Jones and Richard Seyd as Lopakhin
and Trofimov. Obviously the
Eureka's adaptation has emphasized
these "political" characters, but
Abigail Van Alyn and Brian
Thompson are equally engrossing as
the v sentimental" Ranevsky and
Gayev.
Secondly, the Eureka's show
seethes with energy. The characters
are alive with ambitions and desires,
and we are allowed to feel these di
rectly. These are not portraits of
characters from a dead Victorian era.
All too often the lack of change in
Chekhov is interpreted as a lack of
energy in the characters and results in

tedious scenes of several characters
sitting about porches or tea rooms
talking aimlessly. Not so here, as
Trevor Griffiths' 1977 translation
leans on the "modern" side in
dialogue and makes the characters
just that much more accessible.
Finally, as already mentioned, the
Eureka show restores the balance on
stage between dream and reality. By
pushing the characters' obsession
with money they have not reduced
the play to left-wing diatribe about
the evils of bourgeois society (which
wouldn't have been surprising for the
left-wing orientation of the Eureka).
Rather, they have restored the bal
ance between the poetic and practical
in Chekhov. He is a great writer be
cause he captures both the sentimen
tal dreams and the harsh realities
which create the human experience,
not just one or the other.

There are some problems with the
show. One or two actors seem a little
too flat occasionally. There are a few
moments which rush over those fa
mous "pauses" undeservedly.
Sometimes the sneers of Trofimov
the idealist at the "bourgeois" char
acters seem a little too forced, making
the point a bit too heavy-handed.
But in general the show is
balanced: no one person or one argu
ment is "right," and the stimulation
of not being able to comfortably
categorize any one character kept me
engrossed and unaware that two-and
a-half hours had passed so quickly.
1 keep repeating the word
"engrossing," and that's probably the
best way to describe the show. It is
funny and sad, idealistic and practi
cal, but always interesting.
Trofimov's optimistic speeches about
the new age of the worker not only
prophesize the events of 1917, but
also contrast with those of 1956,
1968, and 1980.
The love interests between all the
characters display both the bitter and
the sweet of the most universal of
passions. Money and love in Chek
hov's world have no singular
meaning, only that which we attach to
them. This is what excites me in
Chekhov, and what the Eureka has
captured so well.
Productions like this don't come
around often, particularly of Chek
hov, so catch it while you can. "The
Cherry Orchard" plays through May
11 with student discounts available.
