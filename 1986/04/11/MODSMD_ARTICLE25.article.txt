# Pilobolus

I he following photographs were taken at last weekend's
performance by the dance troupe Pilobolus. Six Pilobolus
members landed on the stage at Memorial Auditorium for
three acrobatic exhibitions. The reputable Parisian news
rag called Le Monde reported the following: u On croyait
tout connaitre des possibility du corps humain. Pilobolus
les explore et renouvelle totalement." Tough to dispute,
huh? One can distinguish a Pilobolus dancer by his or her
creative body contortions. Obviously, these dancers are
not shy about using their bodies together to create dynamic
images. Sometimes they are funny. Sometimes they are
seini-nude, but unfortunately we can't print those
photographs. We can only enjoy them in the office (for
their contribution to the world of art, of course). Pilobolus
Dance Theatre members have been accused of defining a
new human geometry. Let these pictures be submitted as
evidence.
