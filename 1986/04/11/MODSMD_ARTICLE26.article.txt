## Whales... It's a fluke if you catch them 
### LIZ EGAN Editorial staff 
Maybe I'm a pessimist. But the first
thing the Oceanic Society says before
a whale-watching excursion is that
there is no guarantee that the huge
mammals will be sighted. So I
honestly didn't expect to see anything
but a small bump or spout of water
through some binoculars.
I was so wrong.
Not only did we have three sepa
rate sightings, but one of them in
cluded three whales slowly moving
together through the water about 30
yards off our bow.
This is the last weekend the
Oceanic Society will take people on
voyages in search of the migrating
gray whales, so I highly recommend
the trip to anyone who wants to see
more of what Jacques Cousteau has
been describing to us for years.
The Society has scheduled trips
leaving both from the San Francisco
wharf area and from Pillar Point, four
miles north of Half Moon Bay. I took
the Half Moon Bay excursion.
I' was surprised to learn that we
didn't have to travel far to pick up on
the whales' paths. The first whale we
spotted, a baby calf, was surfacing
only about a mile off shore. This is
normal, as the migration routes of
gray whales are typically very close to
the shores â€” they are shallow marine
creatures.
The gray whale, reaching 50 feet in
length and weighing up to 40 tons, is
the official Californa State Marine
Mammal. Driven to potential extinc
tion by whalers, the gray whale is the
only whale species that has managed
a dramatic comeback after a 1946 in
ternational agreement to limit the
whaling industry.
Today, migrating south from Arctic

waters, close to 17,000 gray whales
pass along the California coast from
December through January on an ap
proximately 6,000-mile journey to
the warm lagoons of Baja California,
Mexico. Traveling at about four knots
per hour, they cover about 100 miles
each day.
Pregnant females are the first to
reach the lagoons, and they're fol
lowed by the non-pregnant females,
males and finally immature animals.
Calves are then born in the warm,
sheltered waters deep in the lagoons.
Although most mating occurs in
the lagoon entrances and nearby sea,
one of the Society's guides told us
that whales have no qualms about
mating just about anywhere. In fact,
when we spotted the three swimming
together, she watched their rolling
patterns and did not eliminate the
possibility of a little "hanky panky."
(I really couldn't tell.)
The northern migration back to the
Bering Sea begins in February, and
the last to leave are the mothers with
their young calves, who have been
maturing in the calm waters. The
cycle is completed when the animals
return to their shallow feeding
grounds in the Arctic for the summer
months.
The secret to whale watching, as I
was told, is to know the animals'
breathing habits. Obviously, whales
are mammals that must come to the
water's surface to breathe . . . it's the
timing of the breaths that are impor
tant. Each specific type of whale has a
different cycle.
Normally, grays take two to five
breaths at approximately 12- to 20-
second intervals. They then dive for
three to seven minutes. On the boat,
we were told to keep an eye on our
watches to better predict how long

the particular whale typically dove.
To aid in deep dives, the fluke (tail)
is often raised after the last breath in
a series. An extended deep dive
usually lasts from eight to 10 minutes
and then the breathing sequence is
repeated.
The spout of a gray whale may rise
to 12 feet and is visible for miles.
These were easy to spot. More diffi
cult to locate were the "fluke prints."
As the whale swims under water, the
tail moves, creating an oblong, flat
tened area on the surface behind it.
The experienced guides were able to
follow the fluke prints and therefore

had a better idea of where the whale
might pop up again.
Sometimes gray whales raise their
heads out of the water, a behavior
called spy-hopping. Leaping partially
out of the water and falling back with
a splash is called breaching. Last Sun
day, unfortunately, breaching wasn't
on the agenda. If it had been, it prob
ably would have been either to
remove barnacles, to make a loud
noise or just to have fun.
(Undoubtedly the latter.)
Barnacles growing on and falling
off of gray whales create the distin

guishing mottled gray color. Calves
are born slate black, so the lighter
and more scarred the whale is, the
older (and more traveled) he is.
Lacking a dorsal fin, the gray whale
has a series of bumps, or knuckles,
extending from the middle of the
back to the base of the tail. The flukes
are made entirely of cartilage and
connective tissue.
Finally, gray whales belong to a
group of whales known as baleen
whales. Instead of teeth, grays have
baleen, a fiberlike substance similar
to human fingernails, which acts as a

filter to strain such food as am
phipods and small fish.
That is the end of my biology
lecture. Take the voyage and see for
yourself. Two marine naturalists are
aboard each excursion and are very
willing to talk for hours on the sub
ject.
The fee for the three-hour program
is $24 and special discounts are
available. The number to call is 474-
3385. If you don't make it this
weekend, the Oceanic Society takes
people out in the summer for longer
trips in search of the larger whales.
Jacques would be proud.

North Pacific: the Eastern Pacific brand known as the California stock
and the Western Pacific type known as the Korean stock. The Califor
nia stock was given protection in 1946 by an international agreement.

Their population was down to an estimated 1,800 animals from an
original population of from 15,000 to 24,000. The current population is
estimated at 15,000, making the gray whale the only whale species
driven to commercial extinction by the whaling industry that has
managed a comeback.
