# The 						season is here for the north shore area
## 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN 
For those who want the beauty of Lake Tahoe without
the crass commercialism of Stateline's casino strip, North
Lake Tahoe is an ideal mecca. While the North Shore's
main town, Tahoe City, is not without development, it is a
far cry from the endless miles of fast food and aging
motels of its southern counterpart.
North Lake Tahoe does have gambling, but it is a safe
20 to 30 minutes away to Incline Village and Reno. The
absence of crowd-drawing casinos has left Tahoe City
more a small town than a major city.
Tahoe is beautiful in all seasons. Yet for many visitors,
spring is the ideal time to visit this alpine shangri-la. With
this winter's heavy snowfall, the ski resorts should remain
open for the foreseeable future. At the same time, some
days get warm enough to sunbathe on the lake's placid
shores within sight of the snowcapped mountain peaks.
April begins to see the return of waterskiing, sailing and
swimming in the chilly, clear waters.
For ski enthusiasts there are several major resorts in the
area. Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows draw thousands
of skiers every weekend. Another popular, although less
crowded, resort is nearby Northstar Ski Area. In addition
to on-site accommodations, Northstar features all the
amenities of larger ski areas. It has a full service ski school
and rental shop, several restaurants and a small grocery
store.
However, Northstar's greatest attraction is its relatively
short lift lines. The ski area management strictly limits the
number of lift tickets sold each day and late arrivals on
weekends are likely to be sent to another ski area. The ski
area is best suited for beginning to advanced-intermediate
skiers.
For truly expert skiers, no North Shore resort can com
pete with Squaw Valley's array of Olympic-class runs.
Squaw skiers can save a few dollars off lift tickets by pur
chasing tickets in advance from any of Tahoe's Safewav

grocery stores.
For diehard Squaw skiers there are several places to
stay within walking distance of the slopes. Directly next to
the ski area is the Olympic Village Inn at Squaw Valley.
This large complex features beautiful mini-condos. Most
rooms have both living rooms, kitchenettes and separate
bedrooms. Some rooms have fireplaces. The complex has
a large pool (closed in winter) and several jacuzzis, which
are heated year-round. Although within walking distance
to the ski area, the Olympic Village offers a free ski
shuttle service.
Be warned, however, the resort is fairly new and still
seems to have a few bugs to work out. Our room had two
heaters, neither of which worked. After freezing for over
an hour, the management sent up a small portable space
heater with their apologies.
Unfortunately, the biggest faults of the Olympic Village
are errors in its design which are unlikely to be fixed.
There are no elevators and the walk up to the third floor
with all our luggage was a bit much. Also, there is a major
lack of parking anywhere near the living units. On several
occasions I was forced to park over a five-minute walk
from our room. For reservations or information call 916-
583-1501.
Fear not, though, as just across the road from Squaw
Valley is the Christy Hill Inn. Christy Hill features both a
small seven-room bed and breakfast inn, as well as a
brand-new set of self-contained condos nearby. The Inn is
also the site of the best dining in the Olympic Valley.
The accommodations of Christy Hill are both quaint and
classy. Each of the seven rooms has its own private bath
and comes with a queen-sized bed with luxurious down
comforter and feather pillows. During the winter ski
season, Christy Hill serves a complimentary breakfast to
its guests.

far enough from the main road for
guests to enjoy the peace and quiet of
the mountains. Room rates at the Inn
start at just $60 per night (after April
15).
Even if you don't manage to stay at
Christy Hill, be sure to stop by for
dinner. Ask for the table in front of
the fireplace; it's well worth the wait.
Both their baby coho salmon and
their tenderloin of beef are excep
tional. Reservations are a must on
weekends. For reservations or infor
mation on either the Christy Hill Inn
or Restaurant call 916-585-8551.
If you plan to ski at Northstar or
just want to stay closer to the scenic
lake, Tahoe City offers a wide variety
of accommodations. If you are in the
mood for a wild romantic weekend,
the Fantasy Inn chain has a hotel
right in the center of Tahoe City.
Their rooms feature private jacuzzi
spas (complete with complimentary
bubble bath), wall and ceiling mir
rors, AM/FM radios and color cable
TV (adult entertainment plus regular
cable programming). For rates and
information call Fantasy Inn 111 at
916-583-8578.
Foe a break from the typical apres
ski lounges, try the beautiful Mayfield
House Bed & Breakfast just off

Tahoe City's main strip. Mayfield
House is the sort of comfortable B &
B you'd expect to find in the wine
country or the North Coast.
Mayfield's charm comes from the
fact that it still feels like an individ
ual's home, with the different
bedrooms all labelled according to
their original use ("the den," "the
study," "Julia's room," etc.). If you
didn't know better you'd think you
just stepped into your grandmother s
house, complete with floral prints on
the walls and down comforters on the
beds.
Predictably, most of the wintertime
visitors leave fairly early in the morn
ing (after a wonderful complimentary
breakfast) to head up to the slopes.
But walking back into the living room
after a hard day's schussing offers a
chance to relax and unwind with the
other guests — which is especially
comfortable if someone has managed
to coax a fire out of the big fireplace.
The carafe of wine waiting in the
refrigerator also helps put a friendly
glow on the afternoon.
Mayfield House offers a variety of
gracious bedrooms, each with space
to take breakfast in your room, if
you're so inclined. This potential
seclusion is part of the romantic
charm of the house. Rates range from
$65-95 per night, double-occupancy.

after a hard day's schussing offers a
chance to relax and unwind with the
other guests — which is especially
comfortable if someone has managed
to coax a fire out of the big fireplace.
The carafe of wine waiting in the
refrigerator also helps put a friendly

Mayfield House offers a variety of
gracious bedrooms, each with space
to take breakfast in your room, if
you're so inclined. This potential
seclusion is part of the romantic
charm of the house. Rates range from

For those who want the beauty of Lake Tahoe without
the crass commercialism of Stateline's casino strip, North
Lake Tahoe is an ideal mecca. While the North Shore's
main town, Tahoe City, is not without development, it is a
far cry from the endless miles of fast food and aging
motels of its southern counterpart.
North Lake Tahoe does have gambling, but it is a safe
20 to 30 minutes away to Incline Village and Reno. The
absence of crowd-drawing casinos has left Tahoe City
more a small town than a major city.
Tahoe is beautiful in all seasons. Yet for many visitors,
spring is the ideal time to visit this alpine shangri-la. With
this winter's heavy snowfall, the ski resorts should remain
open for the foreseeable future. At the same time, some
days get warm enough to sunbathe on the lake's placid
shores within sight of the snowcapped mountain peaks.
April begins to see the return of waterskiing, sailing and
swimming in the chilly, clear waters.
For ski enthusiasts there are several major resorts in the
area. Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows draw thousands
of skiers every weekend. Another popular, although less
crowded, resort is nearby Northstar Ski Area. In addition
to on-site accommodations, Northstar features all the
amenities of larger ski areas. It has a full service ski school
and rental shop, several restaurants and a small grocery
store.
However, Northstar's greatest attraction is its relatively
short lift lines. The ski area management strictly limits the
number of lift tickets sold each day and late arrivals on
weekends are likely to be sent to another ski area. The ski
area is best suited for beginning to advanced-intermediate
skiers.
For truly expert skiers, no North Shore resort can com
pete with Squaw Valley's array of Olympic-class runs.
Squaw skiers can save a few dollars off lift tickets by pur
chasing tickets in advance from any of Tahoe's Safewav

grocery stores.
For diehard Squaw skiers there are several places to
stay within walking distance of the slopes. Directly next to
the ski area is the Olympic Village Inn at Squaw Valley.
This large complex features beautiful mini-condos. Most
rooms have both living rooms, kitchenettes and separate
bedrooms. Some rooms have fireplaces. The complex has
a large pool (closed in winter) and several jacuzzis, which
are heated year-round. Although within walking distance
to the ski area, the Olympic Village offers a free ski
shuttle service.
Be warned, however, the resort is fairly new and still
seems to have a few bugs to work out. Our room had two
heaters, neither of which worked. After freezing for over
an hour, the management sent up a small portable space
heater with their apologies.
Unfortunately, the biggest faults of the Olympic Village
are errors in its design which are unlikely to be fixed.
There are no elevators and the walk up to the third floor
with all our luggage was a bit much. Also, there is a major
lack of parking anywhere near the living units. On several
occasions I was forced to park over a five-minute walk
from our room. For reservations or information call 916-
583-1501.
Fear not, though, as just across the road from Squaw
Valley is the Christy Hill Inn. Christy Hill features both a
small seven-room bed and breakfast inn, as well as a
brand-new set of self-contained condos nearby. The Inn is
also the site of the best dining in the Olympic Valley.
The accommodations of Christy Hill are both quaint and
classy. Each of the seven rooms has its own private bath
and comes with a queen-sized bed with luxurious down
comforter and feather pillows. During the winter ski
season, Christy Hill serves a complimentary breakfast to
its guests.

far enough from the main road for
guests to enjoy the peace and quiet of
the mountains. Room rates at the Inn
start at just $60 per night (after April
15).
Even if you don't manage to stay at
Christy Hill, be sure to stop by for
dinner. Ask for the table in front of
the fireplace; it's well worth the wait.
Both their baby coho salmon and
their tenderloin of beef are excep
tional. Reservations are a must on
weekends. For reservations or infor
mation on either the Christy Hill Inn
or Restaurant call 916-585-8551.
If you plan to ski at Northstar or
just want to stay closer to the scenic
lake, Tahoe City offers a wide variety
of accommodations. If you are in the
mood for a wild romantic weekend,
the Fantasy Inn chain has a hotel
right in the center of Tahoe City.
Their rooms feature private jacuzzi
spas (complete with complimentary
bubble bath), wall and ceiling mir
rors, AM/FM radios and color cable
TV (adult entertainment plus regular
cable programming). For rates and
information call Fantasy Inn 111 at
916-583-8578.
Foe a break from the typical apres
ski lounges, try the beautiful Mayfield
House Bed & Breakfast just off

Tahoe City's main strip. Mayfield
House is the sort of comfortable B &
B you'd expect to find in the wine
country or the North Coast.
Mayfield's charm comes from the
fact that it still feels like an individ
ual's home, with the different
bedrooms all labelled according to
their original use ("the den," "the
study," "Julia's room," etc.). If you
didn't know better you'd think you
just stepped into your grandmother s
house, complete with floral prints on
the walls and down comforters on the
beds.
Predictably, most of the wintertime
visitors leave fairly early in the morn
ing (after a wonderful complimentary
breakfast) to head up to the slopes.
But walking back into the living room
after a hard day's schussing offers a
chance to relax and unwind with the
