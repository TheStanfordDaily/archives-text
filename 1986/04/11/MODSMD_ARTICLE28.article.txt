It's funny . . . when you hear the name Mama's,
you think of home. But we could hardly call it
home (at least at first) because we almost left
before we were seated. That's how annoying our
initial experience at Mama's Restaurant was. We
hate to be critical of someone named Mama, but it
was a good thing she finally got her act together.
Basically, after waiting in the hallway for about
10 minutes, we asked the maitre'd if we could be
seated at one of the numerous empty tables, or per
haps do our waiting in the bar. He told us to get
back in line. Others left. We stuck it out, and in
hindsight were glad we did.
After a 15-minute wait, we were seated at a
pleasant window table, which afforded us a view of
the many busy patrons of the Stanford Shopping
Center. The dining room had an airy appearance,
complete with many plants, mirrors and tables
draped with white tablecloths.
Bread and water quickly appeared, as did our
friendly waiter. He was knowledgable about the
food and had a very good memory (he didn't write
down our order).
We started with a bottle of the house wine (a
pleasant Chablis reasonably priced at $6.25), and
an order of escargots ($5.50). Both arrived
promptly. The escargots were prepared exactly as

expected — six snails served in their shells, basted
in butter and garlic with a hint of parsley. They
were excellent and lots of fun to eat.
Next came our Caesar salad ($4.50 per plate).
We expected this to be prepared at the table, as is
done in many fine restaurants, but unfortunately

this was not the case. Instead, our salads were
served fully prepared.
The large beds of fresh Romaine lettuce were
garnished with generous amounts of parmesan
cheese and home-made croutons, as well as a
couple of large anchovies. The bottom line is this: if
you love anchovies, you'll love Mama's Caesar
salad, but if you are not a big anchovy fan, you

mught find the whole creation a little overpower
ing. Your reviewers awarded this salad a split deci
sion.
Hunger was certainly no longer an issue upon the
arrival of our entrees. We sampled the New York
steak ($12.95) and the Chicken Jerusalem
($ 11.95). Both entrees were served with pasta and
a fresh vegetable — zucchini, to be specific.
The steak was a satisfying 12 ounces, and ac
curately cooked to order. The meat was tender and
not fatty — no complaints here.
The Chicken Jerusalem was certainly the more
interesting of the two. It was baked with fresh
mushrooms and green onions and served in a won
derful white wine cream sauce with baby artichoke
hearts. Quite a combination! The sauce was ab
solutely fantastic — a light sour cream-based crea
tion with a touch of paprika. Definitely one on the
best chicken dishes we've had in a long time.
Other entrees included veal, lamb, pasta, salads
and various seafood specialties. Mama's has a
nightly list of special entrees and appetizers as well.
There is also an early bird menu with a good se
lection of dinners served from 5 to 7 p.m. Prices for
these are less expensive than the normal $8 to $15
entrees.
Mama's is a good place to have a meal or perhaps
just a drink, if you happen to find yourself with
some extra cash after a day at the shopping center.
The service, atmosphere and food are well worth
the trip to the Versateller ... if only the maitre'd
could take some lessons in hospitality (Stanford
grad that he is).
