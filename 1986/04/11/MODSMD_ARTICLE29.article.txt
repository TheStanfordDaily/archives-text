## Cardinal annihilates Anteaters, 9-0 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In contrast to some of the mara
thons that the Cardinal women's ten
nis team has been playing this season,
the nation's top-ranked team needed
just an hour yesterday to wallop visit
ing UC-Irvine in the first five singles
matches, clinching the team victory.
While the first hour of yesterday's
match could only be termed a
nightmare for the Anteaters, the rest
of the match went no better for the
visitors, as Stanford cruised to a 9-0
victory, lifting its overall record to
13-1.
The Cardinal will receive more of a
challenge Sunday when Arizona
comes to the Farm for a match begin
ning at noon. "They're not scared of
us anymore," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said, referring to the
Wildcats' narrow 5-4 loss to the
Cardinal Feb. 22 in Tucson.
Arizona shocked No. 7 UCLA last
week and will come into Stanford on
an emotional high, according to
Brennan. "They may be thinking,
'Hey, we beat UCLA. We could beat
Stanford,' " he said.
Yesterday, any visions that Irvine
had of beating the Cardinal were
quickly forgotten. By the time Stan
ford junior Stephanie Savides
disposed of Irvine's Uma Rao 6-1, 6-
0, and Cardinal freshman Sonya
Kazazian knocked off Karin Bering
6-0, 6-1 to quickly put Stanford
ahead 2-0, it became apparent that
the Anteaters' mission for the after
noon would be to avoid a shutout.
Kazazian, a freshman from Bal
timore, received a rare chance to play
because of the lightweight opponent
and sophomore Cari Hagey's slight
stomach pull. Though her role on this
year's squad has been a limited one,
she is undefeated in singles and could
be a factor next season.
"I would like to see her battle for a
starting spot next year," Brennan
said, comparing her to Hagey and
sophomore Kay Tittle, who were
bothered by injuries last season as
freshmen but have been instrumental
figures this season.
Tittle put the Cardinal up 3-0 yes
terday, defeating Irvine's Kathy Rose
6-3, 6-2 in the No. 4 singles match.


Sisters Marianne (left) and Alyce Werdel led the Cardinal to a convincing victory over
UC-Irvine yesterday. Marianne, a freshman, led off at No. 1 singles with a 6-1, 6-2 victory


Todd Sitrin/Daily
over Stephanie Rohrer. Senior co-captain Alyce downed Colleen Patton 6-3, 6-1. They are
the third and fourth Werdels to attend Stanford.
Moments later, freshman Marianne
Werdel finished off Stephanie Rohrer
6-1, 6-2 in the No. 1 singles to put the
score at 4-0.
Werdel, playing at No. 1 because
junior Patty Fendick was kept out of
the singles, has been inconsistent this
season. Recently, however, she has
been playing up to her billing as the
top freshman in the nation.
"1 think she played her best match
of the year against Karin Shin
(Tuesday against California)," Bren
nan said.
After losing a heartbreaking tie
breaker in the first set of the match
against Shin, Werdel won the second
set 6-4 and then rallied from a deficit
to win the third set 7-6.
"Her ability to come back was
amazing," Brennan said.
Junior Leigh Anne Eldredge, the

No. 14 singles player nationally,
clinched yesterday's match with a 6-
2, 6-1 defeat of Irvine's Haruko
Shigekawa.
The remaining singles match was
won by Stanford's Alyce Werdel,
Marianne's older sister. Alyce, a
senior co-captain for the Cardinal,
swept the Anteaters' Colleen Patton
6-3, 6-1 in a match that took much
longer than the score indicated.
The doubles matches were more of
the same, though Irvine was able to
capture its first set of the day in the
final match.
Tittle and Marianne Werdel hastily
defeated Rao and Rose in the No. 3
doubles 6-1, 6-0.
Irvine's one brief, shining moment
came in the No. 2 doubles, when Pat
ton and Shigekawa took the first set
6-1 against Hagey and Savides. The
Anteaters' glory was short-lived,
however, as the Stanford pair
grabbed the second and third sets 6-0
and 6-2.

thons that the Cardinal women's ten
nis team has been playing this season,
the nation's top-ranked team needed
just an hour yesterday to wallop visit
ing UC-Irvine in the first five singles
matches, clinching the team victory.
While the first hour of yesterday's
match could only be termed a
nightmare for the Anteaters, the rest
of the match went no better for the
visitors, as Stanford cruised to a 9-0
victory, lifting its overall record to
13-1.
The Cardinal will receive more of a
challenge Sunday when Arizona
comes to the Farm for a match begin
ning at noon. "They're not scared of
us anymore," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said, referring to the
Wildcats' narrow 5-4 loss to the
Cardinal Feb. 22 in Tucson.
Arizona shocked No. 7 UCLA last
week and will come into Stanford on
an emotional high, according to
Brennan. "They may be thinking,
'Hey, we beat UCLA. We could beat
Stanford,' " he said.
Yesterday, any visions that Irvine
had of beating the Cardinal were
quickly forgotten. By the time Stan
ford junior Stephanie Savides
disposed of Irvine's Uma Rao 6-1, 6-
0, and Cardinal freshman Sonya
Kazazian knocked off Karin Bering
6-0, 6-1 to quickly put Stanford
ahead 2-0, it became apparent that
the Anteaters' mission for the after
noon would be to avoid a shutout.
Kazazian, a freshman from Bal
timore, received a rare chance to play
because of the lightweight opponent
and sophomore Cari Hagey's slight
stomach pull. Though her role on this
year's squad has been a limited one,
she is undefeated in singles and could
be a factor next season.
"I would like to see her battle for a
starting spot next year," Brennan
said, comparing her to Hagey and
sophomore Kay Tittle, who were
bothered by injuries last season as
freshmen but have been instrumental
figures this season.
Tittle put the Cardinal up 3-0 yes
terday, defeating Irvine's Kathy Rose
6-3, 6-2 in the No. 4 singles match.

over Stephanie Rohrer. Senior co-captain Alyce downed Colleen Patton 6-3, 6-1. They are
the third and fourth Werdels to attend Stanford.
Moments later, freshman Marianne
Werdel finished off Stephanie Rohrer
6-1, 6-2 in the No. 1 singles to put the
score at 4-0.
Werdel, playing at No. 1 because
junior Patty Fendick was kept out of
the singles, has been inconsistent this
season. Recently, however, she has
been playing up to her billing as the
top freshman in the nation.
"1 think she played her best match
of the year against Karin Shin
(Tuesday against California)," Bren
nan said.
After losing a heartbreaking tie
breaker in the first set of the match
against Shin, Werdel won the second
set 6-4 and then rallied from a deficit
to win the third set 7-6.
"Her ability to come back was
amazing," Brennan said.
Junior Leigh Anne Eldredge, the

No. 14 singles player nationally,
clinched yesterday's match with a 6-
2, 6-1 defeat of Irvine's Haruko
Shigekawa.
The remaining singles match was
won by Stanford's Alyce Werdel,
Marianne's older sister. Alyce, a
senior co-captain for the Cardinal,
swept the Anteaters' Colleen Patton
6-3, 6-1 in a match that took much
longer than the score indicated.
The doubles matches were more of
the same, though Irvine was able to
capture its first set of the day in the
final match.
Tittle and Marianne Werdel hastily
defeated Rao and Rose in the No. 3
doubles 6-1, 6-0.
Irvine's one brief, shining moment
came in the No. 2 doubles, when Pat
ton and Shigekawa took the first set
6-1 against Hagey and Savides. The
Anteaters' glory was short-lived,
however, as the Stanford pair
grabbed the second and third sets 6-0
and 6-2.
