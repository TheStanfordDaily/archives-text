## Cardinal annihilates Anteaters, 9-0 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In contrast to some of the mara
thons that the Cardinal women's ten
nis team has been playing this season,
the nation's top-ranked team needed
just an hour yesterday to wallop visit
ing UC-Irvine in the first five singles
matches, clinching the team victory.
While the first hour of yesterday's
match could only be termed a
nightmare for the Anteaters, the rest
of the match went no better for the
visitors, as Stanford cruised to a 9-0
victory, lifting its overall record to
13-1.
The Cardinal will receive more of a
challenge Sunday when Arizona
comes to the Farm for a match begin
ning at noon. "They're not scared of
us anymore," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said, referring to the
Wildcats' narrow 5-4 loss to the
Cardinal Feb. 22 in Tucson.
Arizona shocked No. 7 UCLA last
week and will come into Stanford on
an emotional high, according to
Brennan. "They may be thinking,
'Hey, we beat UCLA. We could beat
Stanford,' " he said.
Yesterday, any visions that Irvine
had of beating the Cardinal were
quickly forgotten. By the time Stan
ford junior Stephanie Savides
disposed of Irvine's Uma Rao 6-1, 6-
0, and Cardinal freshman Sonya
Kazazian knocked off Karin Bering
6-0, 6-1 to quickly put Stanford
ahead 2-0, it became apparent that
the Anteaters' mission for the after
noon would be to avoid a shutout.
Kazazian, a freshman from Bal
timore, received a rare chance to play
because of the lightweight opponent
and sophomore Cari Hagey's slight
stomach pull. Though her role on this
year's squad has been a limited one,
she is undefeated in singles and could
be a factor next season.
"I would like to see her battle for a
starting spot next year," Brennan
said, comparing her to Hagey and
sophomore Kay Tittle, who were
bothered by injuries last season as
freshmen but have been instrumental
figures this season.
Tittle put the Cardinal up 3-0 yes
terday, defeating Irvine's Kathy Rose
6-3, 6-2 in the No. 4 singles match.
