# Proposed focus program sparks controversy
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
In a forum last night with a top Residen
tial Education official, students living in
Yost House voiced strong disapproval of
the structure, if not the concept, of the
University's decision to launch an experi
mental Latin American/Iberian focus pro
gram in their residence.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Residen
tial Education, said, "The focus idea is a
way of linking and clustering activities on a
similar topic in a systematic manner." The
University developed the program in order
to strengthen the connections between
academic departments and the residences,
she said, adding that the focus houses
would "provide the structure for faculty to
get involved."
In addition to Yost, Adams House will
have a focus in human biology next year.
"Yost will feature programs on Iberian
and Latin American culture, politics, life
and society, while Adams will offer pro
grams on current topics in human biol
ogy," Supton wrote in a letter distributed
to residents of Yost and Adams Wednes
day.
Edmundo Fuenzalida, who is to assume

the resident fellow's position at Yost next
year, said he hoped the focus on Latin
American studies would enable students to
"see ttye way we (Latin Americans) think
and see the world."
In her letter to members of the two
houses, Supton described focus houses as
"halfway between general houses (those
with no official program emphasis) and
theme houses."
Supton stressed that the focus houses
would not be theme houses. "The focus
house is an experiment with another way
to have concentrated topics without having
a theme house." Supton said she hopes,
however, that by "putting together people
with similar interests, we could develop a
proposal for a theme house."
After the forum, most Yost residents ex
pressed interest in the Latin Ameri
can/Iberian focus. Sophomore Nichole
Rothstein said Yost residents "have
become enthusiastic" about the idea of the
focus house.
Opposition primarily centered on the
plan to reserve rooms in the focus houses
for "priority students." In her letter, Sup
ton wrote, "To give a boost to the experi
mental program, priorities for assignment
for up to 20 percent of the spaces (12

spaces in Yost, 18 in Adams) will be given
to students interested in the focus pro
gram. Students will be expected to take re
sponsibility for planning the focus program
and for hosting [faculty members]."
Supton said the priority students
would form "a diverse group who are will
ing to share their interest in the focus and
to plan activities."
Given their interest in the Latin Ameri
can/Iberian focus, many Yost residents did
not see the need for special students to
direct the program. "We could have the
Latin American focus with the regular
pool" with no loss in enthusiasm for the
program, Rothstein said.
The focus would be "just as dynamic
and successful as without priorities," she
said.
Junior Dixon Osburn said he felt that
since at Yost all house members are in
volved in developing activities, the priority
system would create a schism in the house.
"The 12 would feel compelled to organ
ize everything. They would feel like they
were in charge of it," Rothstein said.
Supton said she would be willing to re
think the priority issue if student concern
warranted it
Since they said they were very interested

in the program anyway, many students
questioned the need to label Yost a focus
house at all. "We don't want people to
think of Yost as constricted or structured,"
Osburn said.
Ellen Meyer, a sophomore, said, "The
enthusiasm would be there if the structure
wasn't imposed."
Osburn continued," Res Ed wants open
ness and diversity, but at the same time it is
introducing focus that leads to narrow
ness," adding that "labels are superficial
and lead to bias."
Supton, however, said, "We want to
designate that this (the focus program) is
different than a house with occasional pro
gram interest."
Students living in Adams and Yost said
they resented the University for not con
sulting them during the development of
the focus concept. No student was in
formed about the program until this week.
"The decision dropped on us like a 10-
ton rock," Yost junior Jeff Soesbe said.
Sandy Spataro, a sophomore in Adams,
said, "I think a lot of resentment toward
Res Ed" has come about from the lack of
student input in the creation of the focus
houses. "We're not so convinced of why it
has to be next year." she said.

In a forum last night with a top Residen
tial Education official, students living in
Yost House voiced strong disapproval of
the structure, if not the concept, of the
University's decision to launch an experi
mental Latin American/Iberian focus pro
gram in their residence.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Residen
tial Education, said, "The focus idea is a
way of linking and clustering activities on a
similar topic in a systematic manner." The
University developed the program in order
to strengthen the connections between
academic departments and the residences,
she said, adding that the focus houses
would "provide the structure for faculty to
get involved."
In addition to Yost, Adams House will
have a focus in human biology next year.
"Yost will feature programs on Iberian
and Latin American culture, politics, life
and society, while Adams will offer pro
grams on current topics in human biol
ogy," Supton wrote in a letter distributed
to residents of Yost and Adams Wednes
day.
Edmundo Fuenzalida, who is to assume

the resident fellow's position at Yost next
year, said he hoped the focus on Latin
American studies would enable students to
"see ttye way we (Latin Americans) think
and see the world."
In her letter to members of the two
houses, Supton described focus houses as
"halfway between general houses (those
with no official program emphasis) and
theme houses."
Supton stressed that the focus houses
would not be theme houses. "The focus
house is an experiment with another way
to have concentrated topics without having
a theme house." Supton said she hopes,
however, that by "putting together people
with similar interests, we could develop a
proposal for a theme house."
After the forum, most Yost residents ex
pressed interest in the Latin Ameri
can/Iberian focus. Sophomore Nichole
Rothstein said Yost residents "have
become enthusiastic" about the idea of the
focus house.
Opposition primarily centered on the
plan to reserve rooms in the focus houses
for "priority students." In her letter, Sup
ton wrote, "To give a boost to the experi
mental program, priorities for assignment
for up to 20 percent of the spaces (12

spaces in Yost, 18 in Adams) will be given
to students interested in the focus pro
gram. Students will be expected to take re
sponsibility for planning the focus program
and for hosting [faculty members]."
Supton said the priority students
would form "a diverse group who are will
ing to share their interest in the focus and
to plan activities."
Given their interest in the Latin Ameri
can/Iberian focus, many Yost residents did
not see the need for special students to
direct the program. "We could have the
Latin American focus with the regular
pool" with no loss in enthusiasm for the
program, Rothstein said.
The focus would be "just as dynamic
and successful as without priorities," she
said.
Junior Dixon Osburn said he felt that
since at Yost all house members are in
volved in developing activities, the priority
system would create a schism in the house.
"The 12 would feel compelled to organ
ize everything. They would feel like they
were in charge of it," Rothstein said.
Supton said she would be willing to re
think the priority issue if student concern
warranted it
Since they said they were very interested

in the program anyway, many students
questioned the need to label Yost a focus
house at all. "We don't want people to
think of Yost as constricted or structured,"
Osburn said.
Ellen Meyer, a sophomore, said, "The
enthusiasm would be there if the structure
wasn't imposed."
Osburn continued," Res Ed wants open
ness and diversity, but at the same time it is
introducing focus that leads to narrow
ness," adding that "labels are superficial
and lead to bias."
Supton, however, said, "We want to
designate that this (the focus program) is
different than a house with occasional pro
gram interest."
Students living in Adams and Yost said
they resented the University for not con
sulting them during the development of
the focus concept. No student was in
formed about the program until this week.
"The decision dropped on us like a 10-
ton rock," Yost junior Jeff Soesbe said.
Sandy Spataro, a sophomore in Adams,
said, "I think a lot of resentment toward
Res Ed" has come about from the lack of
student input in the creation of the focus
houses. "We're not so convinced of why it
has to be next year." she said.
