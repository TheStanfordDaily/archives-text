# Cal looks to climb out of Six-Pac cellar
## Big Game, baseball style 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Dare we say, it's bigger than the
Big Game?
It lasts longer, anyway. This thing
spans over three days, not just one.
What's more, it doubles your plea
sure — it happens twice each year.
It's got the band, the hype . . .
everything.
And, hurrah, it means something.
In fact, it means a whole lot.
All it's missing is a name, so here
we go: Presenting . . . The Bay Bridge
Baseball Series. Or maybe we could
call it the Route 17 Series. Take your
pick.
Either way, the Penisula's baseball
power, Stanford, plays host to its
northern rival, California, today in

the first game of a three-game
weekend set between the schools.
The first pitch is scheduled for 2:30
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
The series moves to Berkeley's
Evans Diamond for a 1 p.m. start to
morrow; then it's back to the Farm
for Sunday's 1 p.m. wrapup.
Despite the name, more than a
little bridge separates Stanford and
California. The Cardinal sits on the
Bay's high bank, in a tie with UCLA
atop the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion's standings with an 8-5 record;
the Golden Bears, 6-12, are on the
other side, in last place.
But the distance appears to be
shortening— the teams are headed in
the same direction. Stanford, 22-13
overall, has dropped four of its last
five games, including two of three

from the Bruins in Los Angeles last
weekend. California, 23-16, has lost
four straight Six-Pac contests, all to
Arizona in Tucson a week ago.
"They've hit a bad streak," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said, "but
it's basically all against one team,
Arizona. They've got talent and
plenty of it."
Many experts, including the staff
from Baseball America, picked Cali
fornia to capture the Six-Pac title this
year. Even Marquess expected the
Golden Bears, ranked as high as
fourth in the country in the
preseason, to tangle with Arizona at
the top of the loop's standings.
"Cal won't be in last place when its
all over, but I hope they continue it
(the slump) for at least one more
weekend," he said.
California returned six of eight po
sition players and two of three start
ing pitchers from last year's team,
which finished in a second-place tie
with Arizona, six games behind Six-
Pac champ Stanford.
Back is Cal's jack-of-all-trades,
senior left fielder Lance Blankenship.
The erstwhile third baseman, who has
anchored Cal's lineup for what seems
like forever, leads the team with a
.333 batting average and 27 stolen
bases.
Third baseman Jerry Goff boasts a
team-leading II home runs to go with
a .321 batting average. Kevin Moss
(.331) has been Coach Bob Milano's
"Mr. Clutch," 1 knocking in a team
high 42 runs.
Cal's demise can be traced to the
disappointing showing of the team's
pitching staff, a much-ballyhooed
group in the preseason. The corps
enters the Stanford series with a team
ERA of 4.54, nearly a full run more
than Stanford's Six-Pac best of 3.56.
Will Schock, expected to be Cal's
ace, has developed arm trouble and
will miss this weekend's games.
Milano will send Mark Sampson (3-3
with a 4.03 ERA) against Stanford's
Jack McDowell (8-2, 1.94) today.
Chris Crume, with a team-high six
wins, will go Saturday for the Bears.
Marquess' team, like Milano's, has
been in a tailspin lately, and the
reasons are much the same. "1 don't
think it's a slump," Marquess said,
"but we're not doing the things we
were doing earlier to win. On the
whole, of the games we've won. we've
gotten good pitching ... our pitching
has become a little inconsistent."
Except for Kevin Kunkel's perfor
mance last weekend (an eight-inning.

Walt Harris has been on the run all season despite fighting various in
juries. The fleet leftfielder ranks third in the Six-Pae with 23 steals.
two-run effort), Stanford's starters
have hit hard times. McDowell sur
rendered six runs in nine innings last
Friday, and Lee Plemel failed to last
through five frames.
Marquess said that Plemel (2-1,
2.70 ERA) would start Saturday but
declined to name Sunday's pitcher.
He'll choose between Kunkel, A 1
Osuna and Rob Wassenaar.
Speaking of Cal, Marquess said
"They have tremendous team
speed. .. . We're going to have our
hands full. They match up well

against us."
Milano's lineup is sprinkled with
batters who can hit from the left side
of the plate, a quality the the Cardinal
seems ill-equipped to handle.
Marquess has used only one left
handed pitcher this year, Osuna.
Card notes
All three games of the series can be
heard locally on KZSU, FM 90.1.
David Fisher and Susan Slusser will
handle much of the play-by-play.
Walt Harris, the Cardinal's left
fielder, has been nursing an injury in
his right hand. "It will gradually get
better," Marquess said, "but it's
goine to he an aggravation for him."
