The Cardinal women's softball team hopes to play
the role of captor today when it faces the Arizona State
Wildcats in a doubleheader at Baylands Field.
"We'd like to make Arizona State a victim," Stan
ford Coach Cathy Lincoln said.
Though only 3-15 thus far this season, Stanford
nonetheless has an optimistic outlook for its remaining
10 NCAA Western Region games.
"Last year, we got down on ourselves and each
other. We're sticking together well this season," Lin
coln said.
"We're trying to take it one game at a time, one
pitch at a time. We're not going to rush ourselves."
Lincoln continued. "We're walking out on the field
and saying to ourselves that we're going to win.
That task will not be an easy one. The Wildcats,
sporting a 23-13 record, are currently in the NCAA
top 10 and have consistently fielded strong teams.
"They are a good all-around club. They're young —
so they may be hungry," Lincoln said.
Arizona State's usual main course is opposing pitch
ing, which has suffered the torments of Wildcat hitters
for most of the season.
Backing its fine offense is a capable pitching staff
which, according to Lincoln, is traditionally strong.
Despite their overall offensive and defensive talents.

the Wildcats do perhaps possess one Achilles heel —
youth.
"They are starting more freshmen than what they
have had in the past," Lincoln said. "Hopefully, we'll
see some freshman mistakes, but after 30 or so games,
1 don't know about that."
Lincoln said the Cardinal's chances rest with its
defense, which has been somewhat of a trouble spot
this season, and continued strong pitching from its
starters.
"We certainly can't have any errors on the field, and
the pitchers have to put in solid performances." Lin
coln said
Stanford will start Laura Buchanan in the first game
while Betsy Watson will take the mound for the second
game. Throughout the season, Buchanan and Watson
have carried the pitching load — mainly because they
are the only pitchers on the team — a fact that Lincoln
admitted "hurts since we can't give other teams a lot of
different looks."
One new look that the Cardinal will sport today is a
injury-free lineup. Recently, two starters have
returned for action after temporary layovers due to in
juries.
Healthy bodies or not, for Stanford to clinch a victory
or two, "a total team effort" will be needed, Lincoln
said.
The Cardinal enters today's game with an 0-2 record
in the NCAA Western Region conference.
