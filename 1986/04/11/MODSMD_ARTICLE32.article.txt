# Spikers put season on the line
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's volleyball
team, the entire season rests on to
morrow night's game against UC-
Santa Barbara, which will begin at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion. That is, un
less Penn State fails to win the NCAA
East regional.
What does Penn State have to do
with Stanford making the West
regional? Well, in the past, the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation (CiVA) has usually sent
two members to the Final Four — the
league winner, which wins an auto
matic berth, and the winner of the
Western regional, which is fought
over by the second through fifth
place finishers in the 11-team league.
This year the Final Four is being
held at Penn State, which should
make everything clear. If the fifth
ranked Nittany Lions don't win their
regional, they will most likely be
given the at-large spot which has
traditionally gone to the winner of the
Western regional. In that case, the
Western regional will be played by
the top four finishers in the CIVA.
All that sounds very complicated,
but it comes down to this: the Card

inal, holding on to fifth at the mo
ment, would be knocked out of
postseason play unless it wins its final
three games, including the season
finale against undefeated USC.
UCLA would also have to lose three
of its last four.
Of couse, if Penn State takes its
regional, played before the West
regional, none of the above means

anything, and Stanford will have to
remain in the fifth spot to make the
playoffs.
That's why tomorrow night's
matchup with Santa Barbara is so cri
tical.
The Cardinal is 10-7 in league play,
and the Gauchos are right behind in
the standings, in sixth place with an 8-
8 record. Santa Barbara has a fairly
easy schedule followirfg the Stanford

game: the Cardinal must face No. I
USC. The victor of tomorrow night's
match will most likely earn the final
spot in the playoffs.
"It's been coming down to this
game for quite some time,'' Stanford
Co-Coach Fred Sturm said.
"This is our whole year: we've
been playing for this match," said
Stanford outside hitter Jon Root.
"Santa Barbara at Stanford is a
crucial match," UCLA Head Coach
Al Scates said. "UCSB only has one
tough match left — Stanford. Right
now Stanford looks like the fourth
seed in the regionals."
The Cardinal upset Santa Barbara
on the road earlier this season, but
that doesn't mean that the Gauchos
will be a pushover. The squad was
without the services of outside hitter
John Costy, who leads UCSB with
209 kills. The junior is healthy again,
and will team up with All-American
setter Jared Hoffman, who scored 25
kills against Stanford in the last
meeting between the two.
"Costy is their big hitter," Sturm
said,"and they have an outstanding
setter, Hoffman. The rest of the team
is balanced."
"They're at full strength," Root said. "Costy
is a really powerful hitter out of the back row."
Stanford, however, is not at full strength. All-
American Root has been beset with various in
juries that affected his play on the recent south
ern road trip. " The poor guy has been injury -
ridden all season," Sturm said. "He was in defi
nite pain against UCLA. His health is always a
factor, but even with his back, shoulder and

ankle, he's still had a great year. He'll find any
way to play if he can."
"I feel fair," Root said, "fair enough. I'm
living for this one game. Pain or pleasure, I'll be
there."
Regarding the potential playoff problems,
Sturm said, "We'll still do our best no matter
what the decision. It will have no bearing on
how we play.
"Santa Barbara should be a hard-fought
match. When Stanford plays Santa Barbara, it's
more than just a game, there's more at stake.
It's a rivalry," Sturm said.

209 kills. The junior is healthy again,
and will team up with All-American
setter Jared Hoffman, who scored 25
kills against Stanford in the last
meeting between the two.
"Costy is their big hitter," Sturm
said,"and they have an outstanding
setter, Hoffman. The rest of the team
is balanced."
"They're at full strength," Root said. "Costy
is a really powerful hitter out of the back row."
Stanford, however, is not at full strength. All-
American Root has been beset with various in
juries that affected his play on the recent south
ern road trip. " The poor guy has been injury -
ridden all season," Sturm said. "He was in defi
nite pain against UCLA. His health is always a
factor, but even with his back, shoulder and

ankle, he's still had a great year. He'll find any
way to play if he can."
"I feel fair," Root said, "fair enough. I'm
living for this one game. Pain or pleasure, I'll be
there."
Regarding the potential playoff problems,
Sturm said, "We'll still do our best no matter
what the decision. It will have no bearing on
how we play.
"Santa Barbara should be a hard-fought
match. When Stanford plays Santa Barbara, it's
more than just a game, there's more at stake.
It's a rivalry," Sturm said.

For the Stanford men's volleyball
team, the entire season rests on to
morrow night's game against UC-
Santa Barbara, which will begin at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion. That is, un
less Penn State fails to win the NCAA
East regional.
What does Penn State have to do
with Stanford making the West
regional? Well, in the past, the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation (CiVA) has usually sent
two members to the Final Four — the
league winner, which wins an auto
matic berth, and the winner of the
Western regional, which is fought
over by the second through fifth
place finishers in the 11-team league.
This year the Final Four is being
held at Penn State, which should
make everything clear. If the fifth
ranked Nittany Lions don't win their
regional, they will most likely be
given the at-large spot which has
traditionally gone to the winner of the
Western regional. In that case, the
Western regional will be played by
the top four finishers in the CIVA.
All that sounds very complicated,
but it comes down to this: the Card

inal, holding on to fifth at the mo
ment, would be knocked out of
postseason play unless it wins its final
three games, including the season
finale against undefeated USC.
UCLA would also have to lose three
of its last four.
Of couse, if Penn State takes its
regional, played before the West
regional, none of the above means

anything, and Stanford will have to
remain in the fifth spot to make the
playoffs.
That's why tomorrow night's
matchup with Santa Barbara is so cri
tical.
The Cardinal is 10-7 in league play,
and the Gauchos are right behind in
the standings, in sixth place with an 8-
8 record. Santa Barbara has a fairly
easy schedule followirfg the Stanford

game: the Cardinal must face No. I
USC. The victor of tomorrow night's
match will most likely earn the final
spot in the playoffs.
"It's been coming down to this
game for quite some time,'' Stanford
Co-Coach Fred Sturm said.
"This is our whole year: we've
been playing for this match," said
Stanford outside hitter Jon Root.
"Santa Barbara at Stanford is a
crucial match," UCLA Head Coach
Al Scates said. "UCSB only has one
tough match left — Stanford. Right
now Stanford looks like the fourth
seed in the regionals."
The Cardinal upset Santa Barbara
on the road earlier this season, but
that doesn't mean that the Gauchos
will be a pushover. The squad was
without the services of outside hitter
John Costy, who leads UCSB with
209 kills. The junior is healthy again,
and will team up with All-American
setter Jared Hoffman, who scored 25
kills against Stanford in the last
meeting between the two.
"Costy is their big hitter," Sturm
said,"and they have an outstanding
setter, Hoffman. The rest of the team
is balanced."
"They're at full strength," Root said. "Costy
is a really powerful hitter out of the back row."
