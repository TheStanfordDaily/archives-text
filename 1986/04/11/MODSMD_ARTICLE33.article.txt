# Inconsistent golfers return to the Farm
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford men's
golf team will attempt to once again
prove the adage "There's no place
like home,'' as it hosts the U.S. Inter
collegiate here at the Stanford Golf
Course.
Last fall marked the most recent il
lustration of that proverb, as Stanford
defeated a strong field to win the
Stanford Fall Intercollegiate by 10
strokes.
However, though it usually takes
advantage of playing on its own turf,
the Cardinal will have to overcome
another challenging field as well as its
own lack of consistency to repeat last
fall's success.
Top teams entered in the 54-hole.
two-day tournament are USC, which
finished second at Stanford last fall,
Arizona State, which was sixth at the
Henry Homburg Invitational in
Beaumont, Texas, two weeks ago,
Fresno State and Long Beach State.
"We also expect challenges from
Oregon, UOP (University of the
Pacific) and San Jose State," Stan
ford Coach Tim Schaaf said. "It's an
excellent field, and there are other
teams that could make a run."
Several of the top individual
players in the country will also be
teeing off Saturday for the first day of
27; holes, including ASU's Bill
Mayfair and Rich Beitz, Long Beach
State's Mike Ivy and Paul Goydus,

USC's Terence Miskell and Mike
Blewitt, Oregon State's Jeff Jarvis,
and Fresno State's Tim Lostalot.
Stanford boasts some fine individ
uals itself. Its six-man team consists
of Carl Wagner, who led the Cardinal
to its fall victory, Don Walsworth,
John Dickey, Phil Rowley, Roger
Miraglia and Rich Marik.
In addition, four members of the
Cardinal squad. Brad Geer, Mike
Pope, Casey Pittock and Jeff Gilbert,
will be playing as individuals but
won't have their scores counted with
the team's.
When Stanford won its home
tournament at a similar stage in the
fall season, the team was playing
stronger golf as a unit. However, the
Cardinal has been up and down in
1986, finishing as low as an 18th
place tie in the John Burns Invita
tional in Hawaii in Februaiy. In its
last tournament, the Henry Hom
burg, Stanford finished tied for 14th.
"We as a team need to do well to
re-establish ourselves as the top team
on the West Coast," Rowley said.
Much of Stanford's problems have
arisen from poor individual rounds
that deviate from the team's normal
performance.
So it remains to be seen which
Cardinal team will play this weekend:
the one that finished tied for 18th in
Hawaii or the squad that won its
tournament this fall. When Stanford
plays at home, it would be wise to bet
on the latter.

The Cardinal has been erratic on the links this season. After a promis
ing fall season which saw Stanford take its own tournament, the golfers
have faltered in the spring. Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf is hoping his
team can regain its fall form at this weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate
which will be held on the Farm.
