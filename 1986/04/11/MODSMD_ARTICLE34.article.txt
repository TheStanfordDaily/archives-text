# Marathon soccer in Maples
## 
### JIM GUNTON Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Sam Koch
has announced that his men's
soccer team will hold a 24-hour
soccer marathon today in order
to raise funds for the program.
"Varsity soccer isn't funded
like basketball or football,"
Koch said. "We don't have
three full-time assistants
working year round." It is be
cause of this lack of University
funds that the team must have
fund-raisers like the marathon.
Koch is not even a full-time
coach. "I'm part-time. I also
teach physical education here
at Stanford," Koch said.
As a result of its financial
straits, the soccer team is
forced to raise money itself.
"We've cleaned up the football
stadium after games — we did
the Super Bowl when it was
here — and we also clean up
after basketball games,"
goaltender Alan Branson said.
"This marathon is our big
fundraiser, though."
The marathon will start
today at 2:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. Twelve to 14 teams,
composed of varsity, junior
varsity and alumni members,
will play around the clock.
"Last year we raised about
$2,000," Koch said. "We're
shooting for $3,000, but we'll
just see how it goes. We don't
have a tally yet." This is the
second year for the soccer mar
athon, which was started by
Koch.
Since soccer receives only
level-two funding, recruiting
efforts are hindered.
"We have no recruiting
budget," Koch said. "The
recruiting that goes on comes
from my own pocket."
"Out of the five players that
the coach was going after this
year, I think he got maybe one of
them," Angel Vazquez said. "The
fact that Stanford can't afford to fly
recruits out here, of course, has some
bearing on its recruiting results."
Nonetheless, this year the team

finished second in the Pacific Soccer
Conference and fifth in the West
Coast rankings.
Today's marathon is an important
milestone if Stanford is to continue its
success in soccer.
"It's for the future of the Stanford
program," Vazquez said. "It's a good
way to motivate the younger players.
Plus, it's fun."
