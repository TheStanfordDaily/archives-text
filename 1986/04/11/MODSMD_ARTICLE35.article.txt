# Cardinal meets Arizonas
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Today and tomorrow, the fickle gods of the
home-court advantage will decide whether the
Stanford Tennis Stadium is a boon or bane to
the Cardinal mens tennis squad.
Last week, sixth-ranked Stanford began what
was supposed to be a hospitable seven-game
homestand. Instead, the Cardinal was upset by
Long Beach State and edged by UCLA before
rebounding for victories over USC and Califor
nia.
So, with unranked and Pac-10 cellar-dwelling
ArWona and visiting the Farm

this weekend, the god's odds should be on the
Stadium and the Cardinal.
But don't bet on it.
"I'd expect them to give us tougher matches
than they did down there (in Arizona)," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said. "We're going to
have to keep competing well. I don't want an
other Long Beach State "
Last month the Cardinal started its spring
season by defeating Arizona 6-2 and Arizona
State 6-3 in the Grand Canyon State.

and Arizona State. Stanford knocked off both squads earlier in the season on a southern
road trip.
16-13 overall and 0-7 in the Pac-10
and will face the Cardinal this after
noon in a 1:30 start, feature a
relatively young squad.
Arizona Coach Ted Kissell fields a
singles team that consists of three
sophomores and three juniors. Soph
omore lan Aler inhabits the No. 1
spot with a record of 15-14. Follow
ing him are junior Jose Wasserfrier
(18-8), sophomores John Schmitt
(18-10) and Benji Pappell (12-13),
junior Rob Horwood (13-16), and
sophomore Jose Rojas (18-10).
On Saturday Arizona State will
face Stanford at a new starting time
— noon. This season the Sun Devils

have achieved a couple of things that
have previously been out of their
reach.
First, at one point in the year ASU
was ranked 25th in the nation,
marking the first time since the team
has been in the Pac-10 that it has
been nationally ranked.
Second, ASU defeated state rival
Arizona this season for the first time
since Kissell and Sun Devil Coach
Lou Belken have been at their
respective helms.
ASLTs squad is also populated with
youngsters, featuring two freshmen,
one sophomore and three juniors.
On the other hand, the Cardinal,
whose record now stands at 10-3
overall and 4-1 in the conference, is
ladened with experienced players.
