# Last home meet for seniors
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
A sunny day, four good teams and
weeks to go before midterms. What
more could a track fan want?
If your answer is nothing, or if you
just need a good place to tan and
something exciting to watch, you're in
luck. Just pack up the cooler and
head down to Stanford Stadium,
" here tomorrow afternoon the Stan

ford track team hosts Washington,
San Diego State and Fresno State in
a four-way dual meet.
The field's a good one, so there'll
be plenty to watch. In the men's pole
vault, Fresno State will be bringing
two vaulters who've cleared 18 feet:
Mark Heppner, whose personal best
is 18-2, and Doug Fraley, who's been
over 18-6.
The current Stanford Stadium
record, held by world-rlass vaulter

Joe Dial, is 18-0, but with the likes of
Fraley and Heppner in the meet, it
may not stand much longer.
And even if you don't like the pole
vault, there's more. Tomorrow's meet
will also feature the last home ap
pearance of a talented crew of Stan
ford seniors.
Pam Dukes, Jeff Atkinson, Ceci
Hopp and the rest of the Cardinal
seniors will all be bidding a fond
farewell to the Stanford Stadium.
Dukes is currently in ninth place on
the NCAA's all-time list, and accord
ing to her and her coaches, it's only a
matter of time until she moves even
higher.
Atkinson, the Stanford 1,500-
meter record holder, will be trying to
qualify for this year's NCAAs. If
you've never seen Hopp (a former
NCAA champion) run, you've missed
something, to say the least.
And even if the the sentiment of a
senior's last race isn't appealing, the
team competition should make the
meet exciting. Earlier this season, the
Cardinal beat Washington in an in
door meet. Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson is looking for another win
tomorrow, but it may not be easy.
The Huskies are always tough.
"We've beat them, but we can still
expect a very good competitive ef
fort," Johnson said.
He also said that although Fresno
State and San Diego State are not
well-known track schools, this year's
squads are formidable. San Diego
State has beaten Arizona by 25
points, and Fresno State has a flock of
good athletes to go along with its
crew of national-caliber pole vaulters.
The field events get under way at
11 a.m. and the running begins at 1
p.m. If you agree with senior
steeplechaser Ryan Stoll, who said
that "there's no better way to spend a
Saturday," you might want to spend
tomorrow afternoon at Stanford
Stadium.

Farm for the track team this year.
