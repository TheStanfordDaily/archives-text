# NCAA sanctions Trojans for football transgressions
## 
### 
MISSION, Kan. (AP) — The
NCAA Committee on Infractions an
nounced Thursday it has adopted
Pacific-10 Conference penalties that
were imposed upon the University of
Southern California last December
for violations found in the school's
football program.
The penalties limit the number of
scholarships that may be awarded the
next two academic years and also
reduced by one the number of assis
tant coaches the school may use to
recruit off campus.
The two-year probationary period,
which took effect Dec. 1 1, 1985,
limits USC to 22 initial grants-in-aid
for the 1986-87 school year and 14
initial grants in the 1987-88 academic
year.
Under normal conditions, 30
grants-in-aid scholarships may be

awarded to new recruits each year for
football.
The penalty limited total grants to
91 and 92, respectively, for the next
two years as compared with the nor
mal limit of 95.
During the probationary period,
USC may use eight assistant coaches
for off-campus recruiting instead of
nine.
The significant violations found in
the case occurred during the 1984-85
academic year and primarily involved
the actions of one assistant football
coach — Russ Purnell — who
resigned during the processing of the
case. The violations found in the
case included improper distribution
of complimentary tickets, recruiting
contacts, minor recruiting induce
ments and out-of-season practice and
tryouts.
Frank J. Remington, chairman of

the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation's Committee on Infractions,
said the committee was concerned
that the violations took place during a
period USC was already on proba
tion.
USC Athletic Director Mike
McGee issued a statement which said,
"The NCAA action conforms to the
previously announced and enacted
action by the University and the
Pacific-10 Conference. We will have
four less football grants for the 1986-
87 academic year and three less for
the 1987-88 year.
"Given our present football roster,
that means we'll have 22 and 14
grants available, respectively, for
those two years. Programming is in
place that should ensure no future
reoccurrence of violations and we
now look forward to the upcoming
football season with optimism."
