# Hey, dude... let's go party

### LISA HERSCHBACH 
It is spring again, and time for the traditional slew
of all-campus bashes. Although two items are mis
sing from this spring quarter's party menu — the
Donner Street Party and Aquafollies — the campus
can still drink, dance and be decadent at the Exotic
Erotic Ball, Rincadelts and Splendor on the Grass.

Feature

"Keeping up the tradition was the big argument
for having the Donner Street Party," said Curtis
Cook, an RA in Donner. However, tradition was
not sufficient to convince 52 of the 101 residents
who voted on the issue to give up most of their
house funds, or their valuable time, to take on the
responsibility and risk involved in planning and ex
ecuting such a large-scale event.
Michael Jackson, an RF in Donner, said of the
party, "It is no longer a unique event, as it has been
billed in the past, because now lots of big, all
campus parties go on."
One other big, all-campus party will not be going
on this year, as well — Aquafollies.
According to Fraternal Affairs Advi
ser Joseph Pisano, the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) has decided not to hold
its traditional Saturday water-fest on
Lake Lagunita. Pisano cited high
costs, lack of time for planning be
cause of rush, and risk and responsi
bility, especially with regard to
security, as obstacles to the huge out
door event.
Michael Ramsey-Perez, coordina
tor for Student Organization
Services, explained that this year
"liability insurance has skyrocketed.
Premium rates for a party such as
Aquafollies — with a large crowd, al
cohol and near water — have gone
through the roof."
A few of Stanford's annual spring
quarter fetes, however, will procede
as usual. For the planners of these
events, preserving tradition and
creating history are worth the costs in
time and money.
Alpha Sigma is the only co-ed fra
ternity on campus, and their annual
Exotic Erotic Ball, to be held tonight,
"came out of a desire to be a different
kind of house on campus," according
to sophomore house manager Conan
Barker. "Because we are tucked
away in Cowell Cluster, we want to
do Something outrageous. It is our at
tempt at a rush party," he said.
Anyone who has attended the Ex
otic Erotic Ball will agree that it is
indeed outrageous. Stanford students
shed their jeans and sweats for
skimpy costumes of leopard skin,
lace, leather and chains.
"The tone of the party stems from
its original title, the Pimp and Pros
titute Party," said house president
David Hoagland, a junior. Alpha Sig
received heated criticism for the old
title. "The women's center even went
so far as to spray-paint 'Crime
Against Women' on the outside of
the house," Hoagland said.
According to Hoagland, the house
decided to change the name three or
four years ago "to take the heat off."
Since the name change there have
been no further problems. "It's kind
of ironic," Hoagland said. "The party
is just the same — only the name was
changed."
And what a party it is.

"People plan their costumes a year
in advance, and graduates from years
back return just to attend the party,"
Barker said.
"The house is always packed,"
Hoagland said. "It doesn't matter
what band we get." This year Alpha
Sig has hired a band from Oakland
called Hot Water, which plays
"Prince-type funk," according to
Hoagland.
Because of increasing problems
with outsiders at campus parties, Al
pha Sig has hired three security
guards who will check student l.D.'s.
Hoagland emphasized that "the idea
is not to N scare away Stanford stu
dents, but to keep out robbers and
high school students."

At the Exotic
Erotic Ball, stu
dents shed their
jeans and sweats
for skimpy
costumes of
leopard skin, lace,
leather and
chains.

The problem of security has also
been a consideration for the planners
of the sixth annual Rincadelt party,
said Rincadelt RA Rick Holtzapple,
junior. Rinconada residents are
negotiating with Frost Amphitheatre
in hopes that the party can be held
there. Said Holtzapple, "Frost would
be much better than Wilbur Field for
controlling who gets into the party
and who drinks."
In addition, Holtzapple said a
move to Frost would help to physi
cally contain the noise created by the
party. The noise from the Rincadelt
last year caused Stanford police to
close the party early, to the dismay of
Rinconada residents and party-goers.
There are problems, however, with

Frost as the site of such a party, such
as its policy that no alcohol be
allowed in the amphitheatre. Rin
conada residents will be informed of
the amphitheatre's decision by the
end of the week.
"Even if we have to have the party
in Wilbur Field, we are making a lot
better effort to make sure last year's
fiasco will not happen again. We've
contacted the police, and sent flyers
to residents in the area," Holtzapple
said.
Holtzapple attributed the survival
of the Rincadelt tradition to "the
commitment current residents feel to
people from previous years. There's
an inspiration to keep it going, even
though it's a lot of work."
The very name of the party, ex
plained Holtzapple, who lived in the
dorm as a freshman, "comes from the
brotherhood along the fraternal line
that the dorm felt. As freshmen, we
could have the closeness and every
thing that a fraternity has, but be in a
dorm."
Rinconada has booked the
Uptones for their gala event on May
3. The Stanford Band will also give its
traditional "farewell to the Dollies"
performance at the Rincadelt, since
the Donner Street Party has been
cancelled.
And to welcome the new Dollies,
the Band will perform May 11 at the
annual Splendor on the Grass con
cert, held in Manzanita Park. The
concert's tradition extends back nine
or 10 years, to a time when Man
zanita housed only undergraduates,
according to the Manzanita Park Of
fice.
"The concert proved to be a way
for the trailers, which are scattered
and isolated, to pull together as a
community and have the rest of the
Stanford community as their guests,"
said Ramsey-Perez. The tradition has
survived, although Manzanita is cur
rently two-thirds graduate students.
This year, in addition to the Stan
ford Band, approximately 10 other
bands will perform, for an expected
audience of 2,000-3,000 people, ac
cording to the Park Office. Music will
range from folk to jazz to rhythm
and-blues to rock.
Lisa Birnbach's "College Hand
book" lists Splendor on the Grass as
Stanford's "best party of the year."
Now go and judge for yourself which
you think is best.
