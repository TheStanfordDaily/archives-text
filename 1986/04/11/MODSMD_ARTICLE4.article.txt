# Hey, dude... let's go party

### LISA HERSCHBACH 
It is spring again, and time for the traditional slew
of all-campus bashes. Although two items are mis
sing from this spring quarter's party menu — the
Donner Street Party and Aquafollies — the campus
can still drink, dance and be decadent at the Exotic
Erotic Ball, Rincadelts and Splendor on the Grass.

"Keeping up the tradition was the big argument
for having the Donner Street Party," said Curtis
Cook, an RA in Donner. However, tradition was
not sufficient to convince 52 of the 101 residents
who voted on the issue to give up most of their
house funds, or their valuable time, to take on the
responsibility and risk involved in planning and ex
ecuting such a large-scale event.
Michael Jackson, an RF in Donner, said of the
party, "It is no longer a unique event, as it has been
billed in the past, because now lots of big, all
campus parties go on."
