Cabinet crisis may be averted
JERUSALEM — A reorganization of the Israeli Cabinet was re
ported to be imminent early today, with the promise of averting the col
lapse of the nation's 19-month-old coalition government
The new lineup began to take shape less than 24 hours after the
feuding coalition partners had appeared to rule out any compromise.
Officials said it could have a far-reaching impact on foreign and eco
nomic policy — particularly after October, when Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir are scheduled to tr&de posts
under the coalition agreement.
The crisis developed Monday when Peres, who heads the Labor
Alignment, demanded the resignation of Finance Minister Yitzhak
Modai, a member of Shamir's Likud Bloc, for making critical remarks
about Peres. The prime minister said that if Modai did not resign, he
would take steps at Sunday's regular Cabinet meeting to have him dis
missed.
A senior government official said the proposed compromise calls for
Modai to exchange posts with Shamir. Then, in October, when Shamir is
to take over as prime minister, Peres would take over the Finance Mini
stry rather than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
There was still opposition to the scheme yesterday night, in both par
ties, but Peres and Shamir reportedly favor the compromise and are ex
pected to prevail over their colleagues. They are expected to meet today
to seal the deal.
On Wednesday, Modai offered to resign for the good of the country,
but his Likud colleagues rejected the gesture. They said that if he were
forced out of the Finance Ministiy, they would all resign with him.
Shamir warned, "without the slightest doubt or hesitation," that if
Peres tried "to fire or cause the resignation of the Finance Minister, the
Likud will not participate in this government and the government will be
dismantled."
But yesterday, Israeli television quoted him as saying that he favored
the proposed Cabinet reorganization and that "the national unity gov
ernment was built on compromise and this is just another one of them."
Hanoi turns over remains of MIAs
HANOI, Vietnam — Vietnam handed over to a U.S. military delega
esn here yesterday 21 sets of human remains believed to be those of
.S. servicemen listed as missing in action in the Vietnam war.
The remains, turned over to a 20-man U.S. delegation from the
Hawaii-based Joint Casualty Resolution Center, will be flown to Hawaii
for formal identification.
The U.S. team, which arrived here earlier in the day from Bangkok,
Thailand, aboard a U.S. Air Force cargo plane, also returned two of the
26 sets of remains Vietnam handed over last August because tests had
shown they were not those of MIAs.
Since Vietnam and the United States began negotiations on the MIA
issue in 1982, Vietnam has handed over 128 sets of remains formally
identified as those of MI A's, not counting the remains turned over yes
terday.
Washington has listed 2,436 U.S. servicemen as missing in the Indoc
hina war, including 1,792 missing in Vietnam.
Yesterday's handover of remains, the first in 1986, brought to 54 the
number of sets of remains turned over to the United States by Vietnam
since the two countries began talks in the mid-1985 to quickly resolve
the MI A issue.
Vietnam early this year formally pledged to resolve the issue within
two years with the help of the Unite*} States, which lias made the resolu
tion of the issue a condition for the normalization of bilateral relations.
The head of the U.S. mission at yesterday's the handover ceremony at
the airport here, Lt. Col. Paul Mather, praised Vietnam's efforts to
resolve the MIA issue.
Both sides confirmed that another U.S. delegation would visit Hanoi
between April 23 and 26 to continue technical talks, which the two
countries have been holding every two months, about the search for
MIAs.
Air France office is bombed
LISBON, Portugal — A bomb exploded outside the office of the
French airline Air France here yesterday, causing major damage but no
injuries.
Authorities said the shock wave from the blast shattered window
panes in a 40-foot radius around the office, located on Lisbon's exclusive
Avenida de Liberdade.
An anonymous caller to a Portuguese news agency later claimed re
sponsibility for the blast on behalf of the French terrorist organization
"direct action."
Pakistani leader returns from exile
LAHORE, Pakistan — Hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis roared
their condemnation of President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and their sup
port for Benazir Bhutto yesterday as the opposition leader returned
from political exile.
The return of the daughter and political heir of former Prime Minister
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto appeared to mark Zia's most serious domestic poli
tical challenge. She has vowed to campaign for Zia's resignation and for
immediate national elections to replace the man who overthrew her
father in 1977 and then saw him executed.
Before her return, Bhutto, 32, had told interviewers in London that
she would not launch a "frontal attack" on Zia's government. But,
speaking at a massive rally in Lahore's old city tonight, Bhutto said that
if Zia refused to step down and schedule new elections, "the people will
pursue their own line of action."
The massive welcome — which many local residents judged the largest
gathering in Lahore since Pakistan's formation — confirmed that Bhutto
retains a powerful hold over a substantial segment of the population for
which her father remains a political hero.
"We knew she would get the largest crowd," said Mohabbat Ali
Dogar, a Lahore lawyer and a senior official of Prime Minister
Mohammed Khan Junejo's Moslem League party. "She is very popular
here in Punjab, and the government is keeping its hands off' the demon
stration.
In 1977, Zia overthrew Ali Bhutto in a military coup and immediately
declared martial law. Zia lifted the martial law last December as part of
a controlled return to civilian rule.
With the encouragement of the Reagan administration, Zia last year
held nonpartisan elections to a National Assembly — elections that
Bhutto's party and other opposition groups boycotted as unfair. The
elections gathered a respectable turnout, however, and produced a con
servative assembly from which Zia appointed Prime Minister Junejo and
a civilian Cabinet.
Bhutto's party and the 11 smaller members of the opposition Move
ment for the Restoration of Democracy have been permitted to resume
political activities under civilian rule, but have insisted on new elections,
which they say cannot be fair under Zia's authority.
Iran, Iraq clash in ground battles
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq said yesterday its troops killed 190 Iranian
soldiers in repelling a ground attack in the southern border region of the
Gulf war front. In Tehran, Iran reported repulsing an Iraqi attack in
the same sector. Iran said its warplanes inflicted heavy damage at Iraqi
troop concentrations and armored positions near Faka, a southern bor
der town about 36 miles northeast of Al-Amara.
Iran's Revolutionary Guard, meanwhile, set up a special command for
guerrilla operations and announced it would be escalating attacks behind
Iraqi lines. Volunteers were asked to enlist.
