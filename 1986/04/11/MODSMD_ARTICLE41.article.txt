# Khadafy linked to bombing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The United States had
warning of last weekend's bombing of a West Ber
lin discotheque that killed two persons, including a
American soldier, and now has "indisputable
evidence" that Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy
was behind the attack, according to NATO com
mander Bernard Rogers.
A highly placed government official yesterday
confirmed Rogers' account but said the warning of
a bomb attack in a specific area of West Berlin
where American servicemen go for entertainment
came through the U.S. intelligence net "days
before" the discotheque was bombed. This official
suggested that the administration reacted belatedly
to the intelligence and was now attempting to put a
favorable face on the situation.
Gen. Rogeis, speaking in Atlanta Wednesday,
said, "The disco in Berlin, the evidence is there.
We have indisputable evidence and I won't tell you
how we get it because. . .well, I can't tell you how
we get it. But it's there."
He said U.S. officials were attempting to warn
off-duty soldiers at gathering places in West Berlin
when the blast occurred early Saturday at the La
Belle club.
President Reagan said in his news conference
Wednesday night that the United States is prepared
to respond militarily if there is proof that Khadafy
was responsible, but Reagan stopped short of
saying there is definitive evidence linking the
Libyan leader to the attack.

Meanwhile, two U.S. aircraft carrier groups
sailed the Mediterranean to be in position should
Reagan decide to order military retaliation. The
Pentagon said the carrier USS Coral Sea — its or
ders to proceed to Norfolk, Va., suspended —
steamed from the Spanish port of Malaga yester
day. The carrier USS America and its battle group
already were at sea west of Sardinia after officials

canceled a visit to Cannes on the French Riviera.
Britain's Lord Carrington, the secretary general
of NATO, said in a television interview yesterday
that "I don't think the United States can sit back
and allow this sort of terrorism. . . without taking
some sort of retaliatory action."
"What it would be, I don't know,"he said on
NBC's "Today" show. "I don't think you could say
anything the United States would do would be sup
ported by the Europeans. But I can tell you there
would be a very great deal of sympathy and support
for the United States doing something."
On Capitol Hill yesterday, Sen. Sam Nunn (Ga.)
ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Commit
tee and a member of the Select Committee on In
telligence, complained about widespread disclosure
of highly sensitive intelligence information.
Nunn was among several senators who said yes
terday that if the Libyan connection to the bombing
can be firmly established, Reagan would be justi
fied in taking retaliatory action.
In a sign of growing European concern about
Libya, Spain recalled its ambassador to Tripoli. In
Madrid, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that
Ambassador Ricardo Peydro was being brought
home for consultations about Khadafy's reported
threat to attack nations that are host to U.S. mili
tary facilities. Several major bases in Spain support
U.S. operations and could play a role in an attack
against Libya.
