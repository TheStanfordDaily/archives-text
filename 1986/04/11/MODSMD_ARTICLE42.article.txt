# Aid to contras may be scuttled
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Rejecting a
last-minute plea by Secretary of State
George Shultz, the House Demo
cratic leadership yesterday adopted a
key parliamentary tactic that the
Reagan administration charges could
effectively scuttle its proposed $100
million aid package for the
Nicaraguan rebels.
At a half-hour meeting with House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill Jr.
(D-Mass.) Shultz urged that next
week's scheduled House vote on aid
to the counter-revolutionary rebels,
known as contras, be separated from
consideration of the fiscal 1986
1 supplemental-appropriations bill.
But O'Neill, according to his aides,
. rejected this and several hours later
the House Rules Committee ap
proved the controversial groundrules
tying the contra-aid package to the
appropriations measure when both
bills reach the House floor next week.
Those groundrules, if adopted by

the full House in what may be the key
showdown in the legislative battle,
would automatically incorporate the
contra-aid package into the spending
bill if both measures are approved by
the House. The administration has
strong objections to several provi
sions of the $1.7 billion appropria
tions bill and White House officials
yesterday threatened a presidential
veto even if that kills the contra aid at
the same time.
The administration also argues that
the contras are likely to be crushed by
Nicaragua's Sandinista government in
the weeks or months it will take for
the appropriations bill to clear the
Senate and finally be enacted.
House Republicans charged yester
day that by linking the two together,
Democratic opponents of administra
tion policy in Central America were
attempting to undermine that pro
contra policy by parliamentary ma
neuver.
