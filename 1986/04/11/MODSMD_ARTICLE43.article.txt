# House OKs gun control reform
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The House
easily passed legislation yesterday
to weaken the 1968 Gun Control
Act after adopting an amendment,
at the behest of the nation's police,
to continue a ban on interstate
sales of handguns.
The Volkmer bill would allow
interstate sales of rifles and shot
guns, ease record-keeping rules
for gun dealers, allow dealers to
make unrecorded sales from their
personal collections, require
evidence of "willful" violations in
prosecuting dealers, restrict
federal inspections of dealers and
mandate minimum sentences for
using a gun in a violent crime.
Law enforcement officials took
comfort in their lone victory but
did not hide their disappointment
at failing to win other changes in
the bill, which lifts restrictions on

interstate transportation of rifles
and handguns.
Final approval came on a 292 to
130 vote. NRA lobbyists said later
they would seek to have the Sen
ate, which approved a similar
measure 79 to 15 last summer,
adopt the House version to avoid a
House-Senate conference.
Hundreds of uniformed police
descended on the capitol to
oppose the bill, but they were
soundly beaten Wednesday when
the House voted 248 to 176
against a Hughes amendment of
fered on their behalf. That amend
ment retained the ban on inter
state handgun sales, as well as
banning silencers, barring un
recorded gun sales and maintain
ing local restrictions on interstate
transportation of firearms.
