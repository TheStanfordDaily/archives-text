U.S. holds nuclear test
WASHINGTON — A controversial and twice
postponed U.S. underground nuclear explosion,
which may induce the Soviet Union to end its
eight-month moratorium on nuclear testing, took
place just after dawn yesterday at the Nevada
Test Site, a Department of Energy official an
nounced.
Immediately following the announcement of
the test, the Soviet news agency Tass called it
"another demonstration of the Administration's
criminal contempt for the calls of U.S. and world
opinion to join in the Soviet Union's
moratorium," correspondent Celestine Bohlen
reported from Moscow.
The low-yield U.S. nuclear device, code
named Mighty Oak, was detonated 1,300 feet
below the surface to see how radiation would af
fect the new warhead for the MX intercontinen
tal missile, parts of the new Trident 2 submarine
launched missile, including its warhead, and
hardware for the new Midgetman missile, ac
cording to officials of the Defense Nuclear
Agency, which sponsored the test.
Last July, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
announced a moratorium and asked for U.S. par

ticipation in an effort to negotiate a ban on un
derground explosions. President Reagan refused,
saying U.S. tests would continue as long as nu
clear weapons are needed as a deterrent to war,
to assure the reliability of warheads in the U.S.
arsenal and to develop warheads for new weap
ons.
Last month, after eight U.S. tests while the So
viet Union conducted none, Gorbachev an
nounced that he would resume testing if the
United States exploded another weapon after
March 31.
U.S.-Soviet statement
WASHINGTON — U.S. and Soviet military
officials, after a year of talks since a Soviet sentry
killed Maj. Arthur Nicholson in East Germany,
have reached agreement on a joint statement and
some practical steps that should reduce some
what the risks of another such incident, Adminis
tration officials said.
The somewhat ambiguous agreement, in the
form of an "agreed summary" of the talks that
will be formally signed shortly, was reached last
month by U.S. and Soviet Army com

manders in Europe and later approved by the
White House.
In the pact, both nations acknowledge their re
sponsibility for the safety of the military liaison
missions attached to each other's headquarters
and promise not to use deadly force against them
when they are identified as such. But the docu
ment also notes that the duties of a sentry permit
him to use force against unidentified intruders.
The United States sought the joint responsibil
ity provision to give added protection to U.S.
officers in the future, while the Soviets
sought the sentry duty clause to justify their ac
tion in the Nicholson case.
Stocks continue surge
NEW YORK — The stock market pushed
ahead for the third straight session yesterday,
aided by hopes for still-lower interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
15.68 to 1,794.30, bringing its gain over the past
three sessions to 58.81 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 184.76 million shares, up from 156.25
million Wednesday.
