NASA may place order
DOWNEY — The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has notified Rockwell In
ternational Corp. to suspend making some
layoffs at its Downey space shuttle plant, a strong
indication that NASA will order a new space
shuttle orbiter, officials said yesterday.
Rockwell has also begun discussions with
hundreds of space shuttle subcontractors to de
termine how quickly they could restart produc
tion lines to build parts for a new orbiter to
replace the lost Challenger, Rockwell spokesmen
said.
Even though the Reagan Administration has
yet to announce a decision on building a new or
biter, Rockwell is preparing for shuttle produc
tion, a spokesman said. Rockwell has a history of
such "betting on the come" in its aerospace
work.
A new space shuttle would take three years to
produce and would cost $2.8 billion, of which
Rockwell's share would be about $2 billion.
NASA and Rockwell representatives reportedly
are discussing prices and schedules in meetings at

the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
Rockwell would need to hire a couple of
thousand new workers to produce a new shuttle,
a Rockwell spokesman said. The plant in
Downey, about 10 miles southeast of Los An
geles, where shuttle parts are made, currently
employs about 7,000 workers. Rockwell has laid
off nearly 2,000 employees since last year, when
the last of the space shuttles was delivered.
Man wanders to Russia
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The Soviet Union
has acknowledged that it has in custody a San
Francisco man who wandered across the U.S.-
Soviet border on the Bering Sea ice pack last
week, a U.S. Senate aide said yesterday.
The Soviets said John Weymouth is in good
health, and will be released at Little Diomede Is
land next week, said Steve Hansen, in the Wash
ington office of Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska.
Weymouth, 33, dubbed by Alaska villagers as
"The Wanderer" for his hikes across Alaska,
strolled away from Little Diomede on April 2,

heading west toward the Soviet's Big Diomede
Island.
Villagers in Little Diomede reported hearing
explosions and gunfire on the bigger island after
Weymouth's departure.
The two islands, about three miles apart in the
Bering Strait, are the closest landpoints between
the United States and the Soviet Union.
Big Diomede has no civilian inhabitants but
the Soviet Union keeps a military base there.
Americans normally are forbidden to travel to
the island.
The unexplained stroll capped a months-long
odyssey down the Yukon River and across west
ern Alaska by the reclusive young man, a nephew
of San Francisco newspaper columnist Herb
Caen and son of the late photographer Mason
Weymouth.
What, me worry?
In keeping with The Daily's policy of giving
people what they want, low morning clouds and
fog will dissipate becoming mostly sunny by af
ternoon with highs in the 60s to low 70s.
