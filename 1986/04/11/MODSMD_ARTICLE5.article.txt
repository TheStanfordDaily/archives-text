# Baird rips pro-life advocates
## 
### LARRY WEBER Editorial staff 
As a result of his disgust with "crimes against chas
tity" laws that prohibited abortion and other freedoms
he refers to as "sexual rights," Bill Baird bought a
truck and took his "Sexual Peace Corps" into New
York City's poorer neighborhoods to teach people
about abortion and contraception.
After eight stints in jail and 23 years, Baird brought
his pro-choice crusade to Kresge Auditorium last night
in a two-hour presentation, which included University
of California sociologist Kristen Luker.
"Show me any state law that calls an embryo a per
son. It's insanity. It would be like if I looked at an
acorn and said, 'Look at that oak tree,' " said Baird,
whom United Press International has referred to as
"the father of the abortion movement"
Baird said that if an embryo is considered a person,
then doctors performing abortions must be charged
with murder. He rejected this premise, saying that pro
lifers are too concerned with abortion itself and should
recognize that inadequate federal funding for educa
tion and housing presents more immediate social prob
lems.
"Take care of people already existing and quit wor

rying what goes on inside a women's body," Baird said.
However, a large part of Baird's time is devoted to
worrying about the internal workings of women. His
medical clinic in New York provides abortions.
"Working in a clinic now is working in a combat
zone," Baird said.
Along with the rise in abortion clinic bombings
across the country, Baird cited as evidence many inci
dents of violence perpetrated by pro-lifers at his Long
Island clinic.
He said that a group of anti-abortionists trespassed
into the clinic's operating rooms last December, where
pptients were awaiting treatment, and that groups have
stood outside the clinic shouting "Zeit Heil!" to
women as they enter.
"How dare you (pro-lifers) say that women across
this nation are murderers and Nazis. How dare you say
that because we differ from you, we're evil," Baird
said.
Baird's suggested the creation of a 50-foot
"demilitarized zone" around abortion clinics and a
500-foot "quiet zone," to protect women from public
calumny.
Luker provided profiles comparing the demographic
data and value systems of "average"
pro-life activists to "average" pro
choice advocates. Although the male
profiles of each group were similar,
the profiles of women were antitheti
cal, which she said indicates an in
herent moral rift between abortion
opponents and proponents.
Luker, citing her own research,
said that pro-choice women value
education and a position in the labor
force more than their pro-life coun
terparts, but the latter consider
having a family more important.
In addition, Luker said that pro-life
activists believe in "sexuality as
procreation," and consequently
reject the use of birth control and the
idea of any sexual relations that are
not heterosexual and intended for
reproduction.

In contrast, pro-choice advocates
perceive sexuality as a vehicle for in
timacy, and accept any sexual situa
tion that provides a basis for people
to get to know each other better,
Luker said.
This is a clash between deep
rooted moral codes, which eliminates
the possibility of a common ground
from which pro-choicers and pro
lifers can discuss the issues of abor
tion, Luker said.
"These folks have no common
zero. They have no point where their
values and morals overlap from which
they can begin a discussion."
Baird was not so diplomatic. "I ask
you to recognize that there is a war
going on," he said.
Baird, who presented the winning
position in the 1972 landmark Su
preme Court decision that legalized
birth control for unwed Americans,
cited "the abysmal failure in our edu
cational system" for a nationwide

"teen pregnancy epidemic."
Luker, the author of "Abortion
and the Politics of Motherhood,"
agreed that sexual education among
teenagers is lacking, attributing the
problem to an absence of adequate
role models.
"Have you ever seen anybody in a
clinch on 'Dynasty' say, 'Wait a min
ute, I've got to put in my
diaphragm?" she asked.
