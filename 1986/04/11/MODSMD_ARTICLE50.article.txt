# THE 						CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
Summary
(This statement was drafted by Senate staff but wa\ not formally approved by the Senate)
The New Constitution, if adopted, would effect these major changes:
Article Two: Legislative Branch — The Senate, currently twenty voting (10 grad/10 undergrad)
seats and 20 alternate (10 grad/10 undergrad) seats, would have thirty voting senators and no al
ternates. The 15 graduates would be elected at large by all graduates instead of by their graduate
school, which is currently the practice. There would be 15 undergraduates also.
Article Three: Executive Branch — A new position of Administrative Manager is created to han
dle day-to-day operations.
Article Four: Judicial Branch — The current "bill of rights" listing is replaced by a statement
recognizing the current Legislative and Judicial Charter (which includes the Honor Code, Funda
mental Standard, etc.) as the primary document governing student behavior and rights. Changes
to the L&JC would only be accepted if approved by a two-thirds vote of the students.

Article Five: Finances — In almost all cases, petition requirements for placing a student group's
Special Fee request on the ballot have been lowered. Special Fee requests placed on the ballot by
the Senate would not need petitions.
Article Six: Initiative, Referendum, and Recall — The procedures for initiatives, referenda, and
recall are clearly defined. Petition requirements are unaffected, except that for initiatives, includ
ing advisory referenda, calling of election would require fifteen percent instead of five percent.
Methods for placement on an existing ballot would be unaffected.
Article Seven: Amendment — The procedure for amendment is more clearly defined. Amend
ments by petition would have to be submitted to the Senate for notification before proceeding
with the petition. Calling of elections would require fifteen percent, while placement on an exist
ing ballot would be unaffected. Interpretations by the University would have to be accepted by
the Senate before they became effective.
There are no major changes in Articles 1 or 8. The New Constitution would effect many
changes less important than those listed here. See the text.
Throughout the New Constitution, the language is made easier to read and possibly less subject
to interpretation.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF STANFORD
UNIVERSITY: that the new Constitution replaces the current Constitution of the ASSU.
