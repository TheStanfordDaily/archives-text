# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
## Constitutional Amendment 4 
### 
Statement In Favor
Sponsor: Larry Bloch, ASSU Senator
The present process for amending the Constitution is
both cumbersome and complex. These provisions
streamline the process by having students come to the
Senate with their proposed amendments to which the
Senate can make suggestions including the troubles
hooting of possibly ambiguous phrasing. Students may
also call a special election to vote on a proposed
amendment with the petitions of 15 percent of the
members of the Association. These provisions also
protect student interests by creating a check on the
Board of Trustees' ability to subject an approved con
stitutional amendment to stipulated conditions and in
terpretation. Any such approved amendment accepted
by the Board of Trustees with such conditions would
not take effect until the conditions are approved by a
two-thirds vote of the Senate.
These provisions protect student interests by improv
ing the process for amending our constitution. Who
could be against that?

Summary
This amendment modifies the process by which
amendments to the ASSU Constitution are placed on
the ballot. All amendments would first be presented to
the Senate, which would have to decide at the first
meeting after an amendment was presented whether to
place it on the ballot. If the Senate fails to place the
proposed amendment on the ballot for the specific elec
tion requested, then petitions could be circulated.
Currently, a proposed amendment can be placed on
the ballot by a 5% petition. This measure would retain
this 5% petition requirement fot place an amendment
on the ballot for a regular election, but would require a
15% petition to call a special election.
The amendment also deals with the process by which
amendments to the ASSU Constitution are approved.
As is currently the case, amendments would require the
approval of two-thirds of the students voting on it, and
of the Board of Trustees (or the President, to whom
they have generally delegated this authority).
However, if the Trustees (or the President) attach
conditions to an amendment, the Senate would have to
accept those conditions before the amendment took ef
fect. This prevents the University from unilaterally
changing a Constitutional amendment after it has been
approved by the student body.

Senate Recommendation
YES. Currently, a small minority of the student body
(five percent, or approximately 650 students) can force
a special election costing up to $6000, a cost which is
paid by the student body through a fee surcharge. This
amendment would require a demonstration of substan
tial student interest in amending the Constitution
before a special election would be required.
The 15% petition which would be required to call a
special election on a constitutional amendment is com
parable to the requirements for placing a special fee re
quest on the ballot without Senate approval (which
takes either a 10% or a 20% petition, depending on the
group). Since a special fee lasts for only one year, while
a constitutional amendment is designed to last forever,
it should be at least as difficult to call a special election
to amend the Constitution as it is to place a fee request
on the ballot. At the same time, amendments could still
be placed on the ballot for the Spring quarter election
with a 5% petition.
By requiring all amendments to be presented to the
Senate initially, before petitions were circulated, the
Senate would be able to examine the proposed amend
ment and suggest changes in the language. If the Senate
failed to place it on the ballot by its next meeting, then
petitions could be circulated.
This amendment also safeguards the process by
which the Constitution is modified. In several recent
cases, the University has attached "conditions" or
"interpretations" to amendments after they have been
approved by the student body. Giving the Senate the
authority to accept or reject such conditions prevents
the meaning of an amendment from being changed
after the students have voted on it.
The Senate believes that this measure would substan
tially strengthen the process by which amendments to
the ASSU Constitution are presented to the student
body for approval, and recommends that you vote YES.
