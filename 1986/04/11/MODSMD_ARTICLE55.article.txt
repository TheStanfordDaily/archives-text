# Constitutional Amendment 5
## 
### 
Statement In Favor
Sponsor: Larry Bloch, ASSU Senator
These improvements in the initiative, referendum
and recall process buttress student powers by clarifying
our right to force a special election on an advisory ref
erendum while protecting the student body against
abuse of this costly process. A special election costs the
student body approximately $6000; so this process
should not be used indiscriminately to gauge student
sentiment, but this recourse should be available for is
sues which the students deem to be of sufficient impor
tance. Therefore a reasonable requirement of 15
percent petition is set to call a recall election or an advi
sory referendum.
Furthermore, these measures preserve the accounta
bility of members of the student government to the
students by clearly delineating the process for removing
public servants who are not performing satisfactorily.
Support this reform which will strengthen student
voice in our student government.

Summary
This amendment updates the section of Article VI of
the Constitution, which deals with powers of the mem
bers of the Association to adopt measures by initiative,
to overturn actions taken by the Senate by referendum,
and to recall elected officers.
Currently, a petition of five percent of the student
body can force a special election for an intiative or ref
erendum. This amendment would retain the 5%
petition requirement to place an initiative measure on
the Spring quarter election ballot, or any previously
planned special election. Petition requirements for
calling a special election would be increased as follows:
10% to call a special election to overturn an act of the
Senate ("referendum"), and 15% to call a special elec
tion to adopt an initiative measure.
The proposed language provides that a measure
adopted by initiative could be made binding on the
Senate, at least for the rest of the year in which it was
adopted; currently, the Senate could repeal an initiative
measure immediately after it was adopted by the stu
dent body. In the case of a referendum election on an
item of legislation passed by the Senate, that legislation
would be suspended in its effects once a referendum
was called, pending the vote of the student body.
This amendment also streamlines the section of Arti
cle VI of the Constitution which allows members of the
Association to recall ASSU officers (including mem
bers of the Senate). Much of the repetitive language in
the existing section is eliminated.
The proposed amendment would allow members of
the COP to be recalled individually, rather than limit
ing the recall power to recall the entire Council. The
provision for the dissolution of the Senate is eliminated,
but a single recall petition could be circulated to recall
each member of the Senate. No change is made to the
number of petition signatures required to call a recall
election.
Primary responsibility for verifying election petitions
and placing measures on the ballot is given by this
amendment to the Elections Commission, a non
political body, rather than to the Council of Presidents.

Senate Recommendation
YES. This amendment is necessary for a variety of
reasons. Currently, a small minority of the student body
(five percent, or approximately 650 students) can force
a special election costing up to $6000, a cost which is
paid by the student body through a fee surcharge. This
amendment would substitute instead a 10% or 15%
petition requirement for special elections, while retain
ing the current 5% requirement to place a measure on
the ballot for the Spring quarter election. Specifically, a
10% petition would be required to call an election to
overturn a decision of the Senate; this is the same as the
minimum petition currently required to place a special
fee on the ballot without Senate approval.
In addition, this amendment strengthens the student
body's protection against unreasonable actions by the
Senate in two ways. A measure approved by the Senate
would be suspended in its effect once a referendum pe
tition was submitted, pending the decision of the stu
dent body to approve or reject it. Measures passed by
initiative would be protected against repeal by the Sen
ate, at least until a new Senate had taken office. Both
these provisions are new.
This amendment also substantially reduces the com
plexity of the existing recall section of the Constitution.
By allowing COP members to be recalled as individ
uals, and by subsuming the provisions for dissolving the
Senate under the recall language, the emphasis is
placed on the accountability of individuals holding of
fice for their actions, rather than holding them ac
countable for actions of a larger body with which they
might have disagreed.
For these reasons, the Senate recommends a YES
vote on this amendment.
