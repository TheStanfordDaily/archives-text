# Constitutional Amendment 6
## 
### 
Statement In Favor
Sponsor: Jim DeLaHunt, ASSU Senator
Stanford's student fee system is an outstanding model of democratic taxation — ex
cept for the Association Fee. It costs $ 16 per year, and you never get to vote on it! The
ASSU Senate decides all alone how much to charge you for the Association Fee. This
amendment puts that power in your hands.
The Association Fee is given out to lots of small student groups, and so setting the
size of the Association Fee is a simple trade-off between more funding and lower
ASSU fees. Right now, the Senate tries to guess which you want. With this amend
ment, you can say yourself. Do you want more funding? You'll vote for an increase.
Do you want to cut ASSU fees? You can vote for a decrease. And if half the students
agree with you, the fee will move in the direction you want!
This amendment is carefully written to be responsive to students without endanger
ing the funding that student groups depend on. Fees will increase and decrease in small
increments, so that there will never be a year when there is suddenly no funding — and

no programming. On the other hand, we can make major changes to fees to to
changing circumstances. The fee will be set to the median, not the average, of the
votes, so extremists voting at the ends of the range won't have undue effect. And the
Senate will continue to do what it does well, namely judging how much money groups
need and giving it to them.
Cynics doubt that we students would ever vote to increase an ASSU Fee like this
one. Well, evidence shows that we can and do ... if the cause is worthy. Increasing
these Fees would take a majority, and approving Special Fees for groups like the Daily
or the Band also takes a majority. Special Fees pass, and so will necessary increases in
the Association Fee.
This amendment doesn't endanger your right to a refund of the Association Fee. It
doesn't raise or lower your ASSU fees — the existing Program Board and Publications
Board are locked in at their current levels. In fact, it is scrupulously neutral towards
raising or lowering fees. It doesn't create any new fees. All it does is give you more
control over how much of your money the ASSU takes away.
It sounds like a good idea, and it is. Vote yes — "Let Students Set the Association
Fee"!
