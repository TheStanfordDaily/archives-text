# REFERENDUM
## Sanctuary 
### 
Statement In Favor
The modern Sanctuary movement began in 1982 when a number of
churches extended assistance to refugees fleeing violence in Central America.
Over 275 churches as well as many cities and college campuses have provided
food, clothing, and shelter to the nearly 500,000 refugees who have come to
the U.S. from El Salvador and Guatemala in the past few years.
El Salvadorans and Guatemalans are fleeing their homelands primarily be
cause of violence. In both these Central American countries, death squads
and government security forces routinely kidnap, torture, and murder priests,
trade union organizers and others they consider to be "subversives." Since
1980, 25% of all Salvadorans have been forced to flee their homes because of
the civil war. Guatemala has pursued a policy of systematically killing the In
dian population (which makes up the majority of the country) and has been
declared the worst abuser of human rights in the western hemisphere by Am
nesty International. Altogether, more than 80,000 people have been killed in
El Salvador and Guatemala since 1979.
Those refugees who come to the U.S. have clear legal rights under both
domestic and international law. Article 45 of the Geneva Convention states
explicitly that refugees cannot be returned to a country of war. In addition,
U.S. law (the 1980 Refugee Act) states that anyone who faces the risk of per
secution in his or her homeland has a right to political asylum in this country.
However, the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) has denied
these refugees the legal protections guaranteed to them. While over 75% of
all refugees from the Soviet Union and Afghanistan are granted political
asylum, only two percent of Salvadorans and less than one percent of
Guatemalans are granted this status. The INS currently deports over 1,000
Salvadorans and Guatemalans every month, despite Amnesty International
documentation that at least one-third of these individuals are kidnapped,
tortured, or murdered when they return.
If Stanford students declared the University a sanctuary, we would be both
making a symbolic statement and actually helping refugees. We would ar
range for interested students to offer voluntary services for the refugee com
munity, would raise bail monies for imprisoned refugees, gather material aid
(food, clothing, etc.) for refugees and possibly arrange temporary housing on
campus. Sanctuary would also make the important statement that Stanford
students oppose the deportation of refugees.

Text Of The Resolution
WHEREAS:
• More than 80,000 people have been killed by the army and the death
squads in El Salvador and Guatemala since 1979. Hundreds of thousands of
Salvadorans and Guatemalans have fled the violence in their own countries.
Many of these refugees have found their way to the United States.
• In 1967, the United States signed the United Nations protocol on the status
of refugees, the principles of which were integrated into U.S. law when
congress passed the refugee act of 1980. The refugee act requires the U.S. to
grant asylum to anyone with a well grounded fear of persecution on the basis
of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or poli
tical opinion.
• Only 2.5% of Salvadorans and less than \% of Guatemalans who seek
asylum in the U.S. actually receive it. Thirty thousand Salvadorans have been
deported from the U.S. in the past two years, despite Amnesty International's
documentation that at least one third of those sent back are tortured, im
prisoned or killed.
• The Sanctuary movement is a humanitarian response to this situation and
an effort to alleviate the plight of refugees in this country. Many campuses,
churches and cities have already declared themselves Sanctuaries for
refugees. We believe Stanford should join them.
• A declaration of Sanctuary at Stanford would include the following:
— Arranging for students to offer voluntary services at established refugee
social service programs in the community.
— Raising bail monies for imprisoned refugees.
— Arranging temporary accommodations for refugees on campus.
— Gathering material aid (food, clothing, etc.) for distribution in the refugee
community.
— Conducting public education by arranging for refugees to speak to Stan
ford classes.
BE IT RESOLVED THAT WE DECLARE STANFORD A
