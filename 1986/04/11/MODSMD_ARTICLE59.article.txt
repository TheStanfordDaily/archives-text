# Total Divestment
## 
### 
Sponsor: Robby Perkins
Every nation except South Africa officially condemns the reality of apartheid and
advocates its abolition. The U.S. policy of "active" constructive engagement is inef
fective and even counterproductive in the struggle to end apartheid and the horren
dous conditions (including and especially the unjust detention of over 2,000 children
and the needless slaying of over 1,400 people since September 1984) that result for
the majority of South Africans. Apologists claim that investors can play a positive role
and that companies can have a positive influence, but the shareholder resolutions are
unsupported and ineffective while the desperate situation in South Africa worsens.
Consequently, the divestment movement (which now counts over 70 universities, 50
municipalities, and 16 states) is gaining strength as the means to end participation and
cooperation with the white racist regime that receives millions in taxes from companies
there. Stanford's present investment policy is undemocratic, as the most reliable statis
tics state that the vast majority of South Africans favor divestment (London Times —
Gallup Poll); and it is un-American: "all men are created equal.. . endowed . . . with
certain unalienable rights; life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" (Declaration of
Independence).
Divestment would be both an affirmation of our rights as students and an effective
contribution to the eradication of apartheid. We students pay dearly for a service that

the Board of Trustees is "entrusted" to provide. We consequently have the right to
demand changes in the service when aspects of it are unacceptable. Ranked #1 by uni
versity presidents and proud enough to invite Gorbachev, Stanford would lead others
to divest. In turn, U.S. policy towards South Africa would improve since history shows
universities are the harbinger of radical change. Finally, the fact that the U.S. is South
Africa's number one trading partner proves the validity of Bishop Tutu's assertion that
should the U.S. apply substantial economic pressure," Voila! Apartheid would be over
in next to no time."
The stated economic constraints against divestment are negligible if it is imple
mented over a reasonable timeframe. Transaction costs, liquidity and diversification
concerns are easily accommodated with risk-averse institutional investors like Stan
ford. It should therefore not be presumed that divestment would have to compromise
fiduciary responsibility.
Our present prejudiced investment policy is an embarrassment and disgrace and is
hypocritical for an institution founded in the spirit of the "love of humanity" (Stanford
University, The Founding Grant). Our commitment to the active, nonviolent abolition
of apartheid should be sincere. Please vote yes to divest.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY SHOULD MAKE AN IMMEDIATE
COMMITMENT TO TOTALLY DIVEST WITHIN A SPECIFIED
TIME FRAME FROM ALL COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN
SOUTH AFRICA UNDER APARTHEID LAWS.
