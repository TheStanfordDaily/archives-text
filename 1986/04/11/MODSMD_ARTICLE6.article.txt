# University trims energy costs
## 
### KRISTEN BROWN Staff writer 
Stanford expects to save $900,000
annually in energy costs through in
vestments totaling $2.5 million over
the next three years.
That is the estimated savings re
ported in the recently completed
1986-88 Energy Management Plan.
The plan was principally authored by
Ken Wilke, a recent Stanford
graduate who is currently an energy
engineer for the Energy Management
Group of the Operations and Mainte
nance Department.
Stanford pays $20 million a year
for utility costs of various facilities
and programs.
The purpose of Energy Manage
ment Program at Stanford is to mini
mize energy costs.
1986-88 building retrofits, ex
pected to cost $1.5 million over the
next three years, will save an esti
mated $500,000 annually.
The plan defines building retrofits
as "those where a thorough study is

made of all energy-using systems and
devices in a building. Selected conser
vation measures with high return on
investment are then carried out."
Phase II of Energy Management
and Control Systems (EMCS) is ex
pected to save $250,000 annually
with a total of cost of $750,000.
According to the plan, Phase I of
the EMCS, initiated in 1984, will
soon be in full operation. During the
first year, "Overall end-use consump
tion reductions of 1.9 percent for
electricity, 0.9 percent for steam and
5 percent for chilled water are ex
pected from the EMCS."
Future motor replacements and
motor controls will cost about
$173,700 but yield annual savings of
$71,500.
A variety of cost-effective lighting
programs should cost $80,700 and
provide annual savings of $43,286.
The total estimated payback for all
of these projects is 2.7 years.
A new cogeneration plant
("Cardinal Cogen") will provide the
campus with a stable energy supply,

and is slated for construction to begin
in the fall of 1985. The plant is ex
pected to be in operation by March
1987.
Cardinal Cogen will greatly in
crease energy security at Stanford.
The plan noted that, assuming a natu
ral gas supply, the University will
have a source of electricity indepen
dent from PG & E, and thus will not
be suject to PG & E power curtail
ments.
"In the event of a natural gas
shortage, the cogeneration plant will
qualify for a higher service priority
rating than Stanford currently
receives. Under worst-case condi
tions, No. 2 distillate oil can be used a
backup fuel for electricity and steam
production."
Cogeneration is a technology that
allows a single fuel to be used for the
coincidental production of electrical
and thermal energy.
Total savings of energy projects
already operating amount to over
$500,000, the report said.
