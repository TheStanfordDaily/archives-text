Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
