TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,230
Sponsor: Carey White
Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.

TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.

ommend a YES vote.

TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,230
Sponsor: Carey White
Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Amount Requested: $48,972
Sponsor: Marcia Fetterman
Senate Recommendation: YES

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.

TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,230
Sponsor: Carey White
Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.

TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,230
Sponsor: Carey White
Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.

TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,230
Sponsor: Carey White
Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.

TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,230
Sponsor: Carey White
Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.

TOTAL SPECIAL FEES $511,959 $12.85

Explanation
The table to the left lists the gross amount requested for each Special Fee
on the ballot, and indicates the amount each fee would contribute to the quar
terly total to be collected for each of the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quar
ters. The summer quarter fee would be approximately half that amount.
In other words, a fee listed as contributing "SI.OO per person per quarter"
to the total would result in the collection of $1.00 during each of the first
three quarters of the year, and of $0.50 during the Summer. (The actual col
lection schedule for each fee will be determined after the election.) The es
timates are based on the assumption that enrollment will be the same in
1986-87 as was projected for 1985-86.
Other Fees
The above table includes the Special Fees only, and does not include the
Association Fee which will also be collected, or any surcharges. The estimated
amount of these fees is shown below. The amount of the Association Fee will
be set by the ASSU Senate. The surcharges, which totalled $40,554 in 1985-
86, cover the cost of elections, administering the refund system, and other
fee-related costs borne by the ASSU.
ASSOCIATION FEE $192,512 4.81
SURCHARGES $ 40,554 1.01
TOTAL FEES $774,358 $19.41
ASSU Legal Counseling
Amount requested: $56,357
Sponsor: Robin Petersen
Senate Recommendation: YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides free legal advice and consultation to registered
students (except those who have obtained a refund). The Legal Counseling attorneys
currently see over 800 students per year on a variety of legal matters ranging from
traffic tickets and trespassing charges to divorces. For less than $ 1.50 a quarter, Legal
Counseling provides you with the equivalent of pre-paid legal insurance.
The Legal Counseling Office has long been one of the most widely respected ASSU
services. The Senate enthusiastically recommends that you vote YES on Legal Coun
seling.

ASSU News
Amount requested: $8,230
Sponsor: Carey White
Statement in favor
When you flip through the Daily and hit the ASSU News page, don't you feel like
you almost luive to stop and read some of it, just to see how outrageous it is this week?
It works. It's designed to get people to read it, and it works. People turn to the page,
start reading because it's funny, and end up picking up a little, here and there, about
what's happening in the ASSU. They get information, and they can enjoy getting it.
God knows, student government isn't so big a deal that people desperately need to
know about it. But every once in a while, it can help students or hurt them. Everyone
should have the chance to know what's going on if they want to — and if they don't
want to, they can still get a laugh.
Here's what we publish:
• How much money we're giving to student groups. We give out $750,000 a year in
small pieces — with the News, you can always check up on how we're doing.
• Ads for jobs in the ASSU. Some are actually good jobs, and who fills them makes a
difference in how helpful we are to students. Everyone has an equal shot at applying
now, because the jobs are published in the News.
• Roll-call votes of the Senate. Senators have been safe in the past, but no more —
now it's public how each Senator votes on controversial issues.
• The Senate's and the COP's projects and goals. They may be things you're interested
in — you can decide whether you want to get involved or start a recall campaign.
• Announcements of deadlines: funding deadlines, job applications, come-talk-to-us
before-we-screw-up deadlines.
• Totally random words and graphics. Rude Russian jokes. Evil messages. Senator
trading cards. Voodoo spells.
We can't guarantee it'll stay this funny — there's more information we need to
squeeze in, and the edit board will change. But it gets people information. And it's fun.

Besides all that, it's the smallest Special Fee on the ballot. 210 per student per quar
ter, 40 per issue. Almost as cheap as the Daily, and a hell of a lot funnier.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU News is a publication that for the past several years has tried to
dents know what the ASSU is up to. It has appeared in various forms, mostly as a flier
put on dorm dining room tables. This year, it has been printed as a full-page ad in the
Daily every other week. This Fee would continue a current 50% subsidy to allot the
ASSU News to continue appearing in the Daily.
Students have long asked for some reliable way for the ASSU to communicate with
the student body. The ASSU News was not able to answer that demand until this year,
when it began to be published in the Daily. For the first time, the ASSU News is
available to all students and is read by a large fraction of them.
Whatever you think of the kind of humor this year's News staff has come up with,
consider a moment — you have probably found out more via this year's ASSU News
than you have by any of the earlier incarnations. But even though we get a great bulk
discount, full-page ads in the Daily are expensive. The ASSU is paying for half the
cost, but we need you to pick up the other half. If you don't, there probably will not be
an ASSU News.
The Senate believes that 21 cents per student per quarter is a resonable contribution
to make to be informed about what the ASSU is doing for you. We urge you to vote
YES and stay informed.

ASSU Speakers Bureau
Amount Requested: $66,059
Sponsor: Dixon Osburn
Director, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Statement in favor
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a voluntary, student-run, student-financed organiza
tion dedicated to bringing outstanding speakers to Stanford University. The Bureau
develops all aspects of inviting speakers to Stanford, including contractual agreements,
travel, accommodations, facilities usage and promotion. The charge of the committee
members is to carry out these duties professionally and efficiently.
This year we have sponsored or co-sponsored "Apartheid: A Debate," Dr. Hunter
S. Thompson, Dr. Shirley Chisolm, the AIDS Challenge symposium, the Bay Area
Writers Series, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Haley, John Irving (April 21), Linus
Pauling (April 29) and Ted Turner (May 12). We have often had standing-room-only
audiences which we hope attests to the broad range of appeal, to the diversity and to
the quality of our speakers and our programs.
We have extended our efforts this year to the residences in the form of receptions
and smaller series, so that we can bring the outstanding leaders and thinkers of the
world closer to you. We have worked with the Stanford Instructional Television Net
work to access cable coverage of our events for dorms and for the Bay Area commu
nity. We have created an audip archives to record our events. And we have developed
strong ties with students, faculty and Bay Area residents who have contacts to enhance
our opportunity to attract the difficult-to-get speakers for you.
This year we propose a 1986-87 budget of $66,059, a moderate increase from this
year's working budget of $58,720. Our fee is the largest on the Spring Ballot because
of the enormous costs of bringing top-name speakers to Stanford. When you consider
that the honorarium alone for personalitie such Jeanne Kirkpatrick, David Letterman
and Carl Sagan starts at $20,000, our budget appears small. We do our very best to
ensure that we bring a wide selection of speakers at minimal costs to you. We believe
that our list of events this year attests to our success. We look to continue our success
in the 1986-87 academic year and to build upon tradition and quality.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is a student-run service organization that sponsors
guest speakers on many topics including politics, literature, and journalism. These
talks present a valuable educational opportunity to the community. Speakers this year
included the Hon. Shirley Chisholm, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
Alex Haley, and John Irving.
In the future, the Speakers Bureau plans to continue to concentrate on bringing
more major speakers to campus, of the type that student organizations cannot afford.
Thus, the bureau is requesting a significant amount of funds this year. The Senate
recommends a YES vote to enable the Bureau to continue its fantastic record of bring
ing interesting and dynamic speakers to Stanford.

Black Student Union
Amount Requested: $23,614
Sponsor: Kim Crawford
Statement In Favor
The Black Student Union is an educational, cultural, political and social organiza
tion that has served the Stanford community since 1967. The BSU works to unify the
Black community; to insure the survival and development of Black institutions, to
promote academic growth and excellence among Black students; and ultimately to
create a cadre of conscious Black people whose objective is to develop the Black fam
ily, community, and race.
The Black Student Union has several standing and ad hoc committees to assist in ac
complishing its necessary and diverse goals. These committees include: the African
History Committee, Committee on Western Culture, the Finance Committee, the
South Africa Committee, and the Ujamaa Committee. In addition, several indepen
dent branches of the BSU include: the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, the
Society of Black Scientists and Engineers, the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society, the
Stanford Black Pre-Business Society, the Black Business Students Association, the
Black American Law Students Association, and the Black Recruitment and Orienta
tion Committee.
The BSU promotes cultural diversity at Stanford, which educates and enriches the
entire Stanford community. Annual BSU programs include: Kwanzaa, an African-
American celebration; the Soul Food Dinner; the Martin Luther King Jr. Noon Rally;
and the Malcolm X Noon Rally.
The BSU also sponsors and supports speakers, films and programs that reflect the
Black community's diversity, needs and concerns.
Senate Recommendation: YES
We feel that the Black Student Union performs a valuable service not only for Black
students, but also for the entire community. It has strived to gain a firm, positive Uni
versity commitment toward admissions, the hiring of Black faculty and staff, and de
veloping courses and services responsive to Black students. The BSU also provides
many worthwhile events that benefit and enrich our community, including a Martin
Luther King rally and the Kwanzaa celebration. The Senate wholeheartedly recom
mends a YES vote for the BSU.

Boathouse Party Area
Amount Requested: $25,833
Sponsor: Andrew Cohen
Facilities Manager, ASSU Boathouse
Statement In Favor
Spring, Lake Lagunita, parties. These three words are why none of us went to Har
vard. There is nothing like a Friday happy hour, an evening Barbecue, or a late night
bash up at the Lake. In the past any and all student groups could rent the Boathouse
for gigs. This year, however, there might not be parties up at Lake Lag. No luaus, no
romantic sunset get-togethers, and no fun. What a drag. The reason for this tragedy is
that the old structure is no longer sturdy enough for big groups. There is only one solu
tion to this problem, and that is to build a new and better party area. That's what this
special fee request is all about.
The plan for the new party area calls for rehabilitating the empty space behind the
Boathouse. The area will include new trees & shrubs, a renovated BBQ, lights and a
power source for bands, a bathroom, and new sand for the beach. It has been designed
by the University Planning Office and they have agreed to pick up half of the costs
(that is also why the price tag is a little high; everything has to meet Stanford codes).
Any dorm, house, or group will be able to rent the area, and if passed it will be ready
for parties by May Ist.
The party area will be a fantastic addition to Lake Lag. It serves to renovate a
decaying area, creates an additional space for student groups to have social gatherings,
and the one-time cost will benefit students for many years to come. This fee is a great
thing, and if you don't vote yes you should seriously consider changing coasts.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Boathouse Party Area Special Fee would give the go-ahead for the University
to begin the construction of a barbeque/bandstand area by Lake Lagunita and the
Boathouse. This would be a joint student-University effort; we pay for about half of
the improvements while they pay for the rest.
The newly created party area would enable various student groups and residences to
hold get-togethers and festivities by the glorious waters of Lake Lagunita in the mild
days of Spring, Summer, and Fall. The Senate believes that the Boathouse Party Area
would be advantageous to maintaining the students psyches; therefore, we recom
mend a YES vote on the Boathouse Party Area Special Fee.

Graduate Student Association
Amount Requested: $14,666
Sponsor: D. Rex Wright
Statement In Favor
The Graduate Student Association (GS A) is one of the oldest student organizations
on campus. Our purpose is to improve the quality of graduate student life; we do so on
several levels. We serve as a contact for University administrators who make policy
decisions which affect graduate students. We give support to student groups which

deal with issues in which graduate students are interested. We also organize social
events to encourage students to meet those in other departments. Many GSA pro
grams benefit undergraduates and other members of the Stanford community. Some
examples are the receptions after the Tuesday Films, co-sponsorship of the Espresso
Bar, and support for the Holiday House program (for students who have to stay here
over Christmas Break).
Our proposed budget for next year includes funds to continue our successful pro
grams as well as to have some resources available to develop new programs. We will be
actively involved in the Orientation program for next year. We will sponsor TGIF's
and a dance each quarter. We will continue to build on our liaison network in the de
partments to make it easy for students to pass their suggestions and ideas to the GSA
executive. We actively encourage the involvement of new people with new ideas for
services and events for graduate students.
We are often asked why undergraduates should vote for the Graduate Student As
sociation's fee request. There are several good reasons.
This is the only fee assessment which predominantly support graduate student activ
ities, even though graduate students make up roughly half of the student population
(so that half of every fee assessment is paid by graduate students — even those fees
primarily associated with undergraduates). Graduate students are an important human
resource on this campus and contribute to programs which benefit the undergraduates:
tutoring and advising, participating and sharing their experience in political and social
action groups. They should have an organization whose sole responsibility is to protect
their interests and see to their needs. Still another reason is that many Stanford under
graduates will go on to professional or graduate school, and while there would appreci
ate the existence of an organization like the GSA.
Please support our fee assessment request. Without your vote, we will be unable to
provide support for the graduate students here at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association works to promote interaction among graduate
students in all departments through social events and other programming. Though
many of the issues the GSA focuses on are of primary interest to graduates (graduate
housing, stipends, etc.), several of its concerns (such as the improvement of teaching
assistant orientation) are of interest to graduates and undergraduates alike. The GSA
is well run and experienced, and the Senate recommends that you vote YES on this
fee.

KZSU
Amount Requested: Part I — $54,667
Part II — $9,800
Sponsor: John M. Hamilton
Statement In Favor
KZSU 90.1 is your student run campus radio station. Part lof our budget request
covers our basic operating costs. This insures that we can bring you historic events like
the Bishop Tutu speech, diverse you-want-it-you-got-it musical programming, and ex
tensive live coverage of Stanford sports action. In other words, everything you would
expect from a campus radio station.
Part II of our fee request is to bring you this programming at a quality level you
demand. We are undergoing capital equipment improvements. What capital equip
ment improvements means is new broadcasting equipment. Currently, our equipment
is state-of-the-art 1966. This is bad; this is very bad. Specifically, Part II will provide
the following:
A reel-to-reel tape deck that will improve our production sound and interview capa
bilities.
A cassette tape deck compatible with our production facilities that will enhance the
immediacy of our local news coverage.
A record cleaner so you don't bear those ghastly skips and scratches during your fa
vorite song.
Carpeting — our current bare concrete floors are acoustically equivalent to Stern
Dining Hall. This is bad; this is very bad.
We need both budgets. Yes, Part I will get us through next year, if that's what you
want. Part II will guarantee that KZSU continues in the years to come.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Eric M. Berg
Last Spring, citing the need to modernize their facilities, KZSU requested a 38%
increase in their special fee. To counter arguments that the student body was paying
too much of the station's costs while KZSU neglected to do outside fundraising, KZSU
agreed to increase income from outside underwriting from $3,000 to over $7,000.
Most of this income was to help cover costs of running the station.
A year later, when applying for a new special fee, KZSU had several embarrassing
discrepancies to explain. Last year, they wanted money to buy tape and cassette decks,
new carpeting, a record cleaner, and other minor equipment. This year, they want
money to buy tape and cassette decks, new carpeting, a record cleaner, and the same
list of other minor equipment. Why? Because, without authorization, the station spent
$14,000 to purchase a mixing board (not the $6,000 which had been budgeted), so
they were unable to buy any of the other equipment which the students had voted
money for.
Furthermore, KZSU chose to take their underwriting revenue, which was to have
supported general station operations (making KZSU less dependent on future Special
Fees), and spend it all on travel for their Sports department. In fact, even though
Sports seems to be the only department which can generate outside income, students
are still being asked to subsidize it by almost $3,000. Other college stations are able to
generate large amounts of underwriting income — Stanford students should be able to
do at least as well.
Despite this record of financial mismanagement, KZSU is now requesting total Spe
cial Fee funding of $64,467. To put this in perspective, note that until the current year,
KZSU and Club Sports received almost identical levels of funding. Next year, if their
full request is approved, KZSU's fee will be over 30% larger than what Club Sports
has requested!
Even though few Stanford students actually admit to listening to KZSU on a regular
basis, many students apparently vote funding for the station in the belief that "a
campus needs a radio station." Unfortunately, KZSU has taken advantage of this atti
tude by refusing to take any responsibility for making the station more self-supporting.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!

Statement In Opposition — Part II
Eric M. Berg
Part II of KZSU's special fee request consists of funds to purchase a number of
items of capital equipment.
As explained in the statement against Part I above, all of these things were origiAally
scheduled to be purchased with funds from KZSU's current (1985-86) fee. However,
the station decided to violate their budget and divert $8,000 from these other pur
chases to a mixing board. This resulted in a cost overrun of 133%, a number which
would make even the Pentagon proud. As a result, KZSU is now asking the student
body to vote a second time for things which we already agreed to pay for in our fees
this year!
Even if you want to see the student body continue to support KZSU's operations,
you shouldn't vote for Part II of their request. All of the funds required for the sta
tion's current operations are contained in Part I of their budget. Not even KZSU's
management expects Part II to pass — they just figured they had nothing to lose by
getting petitions and asking you for an extra $ 10,000, after their initial fee request had
been placed on the ballot by the Senate.
If both parts of KZSU's fee request pass, the station's total Special Fee will have in
creased 56% over a two-year period, a period in which most other fees increased by a
maximum of 30%. KZSU asks for larger and larger fees each year because it's easier
to get mpney from you than it is to make a serious effort at outside fundraising.
The only way KZSU is going to curtail ever-increasing reliance on fee funds is if
their fees have more trouble passing. Vote NO to send KZSU a message that they
need more outside funding, not more student fee money!
Senate Recommendation on PART I: NEUTRAL
Last year, KZSU's fee increased by a substantial amount over previous years. They
justified the large increase by saying that it would go to pay for sorely-needed new
equipment, that they would expand their efforts to seek sponsors who would under
write their programs, and that they wouldn't keep asking for such large fees in the
future.
But this year, KZSU is asking for almost as much as last year. They didn't manage to
buy all of the new equipment that they sorely needed last year, they were largely un
successful in finding new sponsors who would underwrite their programs, and they ex
pect to continue asking for fees as large as this one if the future.
We are concerned by the size of KZSU's request, which will be the second-largest
fee on this year's ballot, and by its dependence on special fee funding to the exclusion
of other funding sources, such as underwriting and listener contributions.
We believe that KZSU's additional capital expenditures are necessary and
worthwhile. Furthermore, we would not like to see the station cease operating next
year. However, because we also question the extent of KZSU's on-campus audience,
we are unsure if the station is worth the nearly $55,000 requested.
Therefore, our recommendation is NEUTRAL.

LSJUMB
Amount Requested: Part I — $34,371
Part II —$7,129
Sponsor: Jeff Stevens
Statement In Favor — Part I
The Stanford Band, or LSJUMB for short, is one of Stanford's most visible (and
audible!) student-run organizations. The sole aim of the LSJUMB is to provide spirit
and entertainment to the Stanford community (both on and off campus). We perform
at Stanford events year-round, both athletic and otherwise, in an attempt to 1) create
enthusiasm, and 2) motivate the people of Stanford to become involved in the activi
ties which take place in association with this University.
The first section of our budget can essentially be classified as our operating expenses
— in other words, all the funding needed to make the Band run smoothly on campus.
Once again, the LSJUMB requests your continued support.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Stanford Band provides entertainment for Stanford students, alumni, and other
members of the Stanford community. The Band performs at home football and bas
ketball games and at other University functions; its unique style of music and enter
tainment is widely recognized. In the past, the Stanford Band has performed at frosh
and alumni gatherings, and has played a key role in promoting campus spirit during
Big Game week. Therefore, the Senate recommends a YES vote on the Band's operat
ing budget.
Statement In Favor — Part II
Yes, besides performing in and around the Stanford community, we also travel.
Granted, our trips do not directly benefit each and every student; however, the spirited
masses who travel to away games, and the teams themselves, benefit tremendously.
The students who remain at Stanford also receive indirect benefits: their parents who
live in the "away" town are entertained, alumni are kept happy, and Stanford's image
is enhanced as not only a sports powerhouse, but also a wild, creative, energetic, funny
and diverse university.
Part II of our budget is written to fund a roadtrip during the basketball season in
1987. With the basektball team presently on the verge of becoming a strong force in
the Pacific 10 conference, support on the road could be the difference needed to make
Stanford basketball a playoff bound program. This part of our budget would finance a
winter trip to either Oregon or Washington to play for the weekend basketball games
in one of those states. Such a trip will be far less expensive than past Band roadtrips (a
reduction of over $20,000 from a major football roadtrip), and yet will provide our
athletic program and this university with vital support. We ask that the students recog
nize not only the Band's intense commitment to Stanford, but the students' own com
mitment to the diversity of Stanford — home and away. All Right Now!
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
The Senate divided the Band's budget into its operating and roadtrip components to
provide students the opportunity to decide whether or not to fund the trip. The Senate
believes the Band's winter road trip predominantly benefits the participating Band
members, not the Stanford community at large. Because a very substantial portion of
the roadtrip would be paid for with student funds, but most students would gain little
from this excursion, the Senate recommends aNO vote on the roadtrip budget. .

The All-Campus Party Fund
Amount Requested: Part I — $11,091
Part II — $9,145
Sponsor: David Smolen, Christian McGrath
Statement In Favor
The All-Campus Party Fund. You are probably asking yourself, "Is this for real?
Should I take this seriously?" The answer to both of those questions is a resounding
"YES!" We are for real, and we are very serious about putting on all-campus parties at
Stanford.
The All-Campus Party Fund is a volunteer student group whose sole purpose is the
planning and implementation of all-campus parties. We feel that such parties provide a
unique environment to socialize and meet new people. Smaller parties are worthwhile,
but they are also often somewhat exclusive as a result of their size and structure. Our
parties, however, will allow the entire student population the opportunity to come to
gether in a festive atmosphere.
The All-Campus Party Fund will also enable a large portion of the student popula
tion to be involved in the planning of campus parties. The Board will be comprised of
representatives from each class, graduate students, students from off-campus, and stu
dents from both the east and west sides of campus. As a result, these parties will truly
reflect the diverse interests of the Stanford student population. Our group is open to
all registered students of Stanford University, as are all of the parties that we will put
on.
"What kind of parties do you plan on throwing, and who's to say they won't be
duds?" These are probably your next questions. They won't be duds because our idea
of a party isn't simply pulling a beer truck onto Wilbur field and hoping people will
come. We have creative ideas, ideas such as a birthday party for Leland Jr. in the Quad
during Spring Quarter, or a Welcome Back to the Farm party in the fall at the newly
renovated Boathouse Party Area. Diverse forms of entertainment and refreshments,
cultural themes, and inventive locations will insure that All-Campus Party Fund
sponsored parties will have the high degree of quality that Stanford students demand.
We feel all Stanford students should have the opportunity to take part in organized
and creative parties. Vote for the All-Campus Party Fund and help improve the social
atmosphere at Stanford.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: YES
The Party Fund is a student organization that exists solely to throw a big all-campus
party each quarter. The Fall party will be at the Boathouse, the Winter party in
Maples, and the Spring party in the Quad. The first section of their budget pays only
for the Fall and Spring parties and for operating expenses.
This campus has many small parties, and even a few medium-sized ones, but almost
none open to and intended for all 12,000 students, grad and undergrad. Part of the
reason is that it's hard to find money for a truly all-campus party. The Party Fund in
tends to solve this by having a Special Fee devoted to the fun and recreation of the
entire student body. The Party Fund organization has been set up to make sure every
student — grad, undergrad, on-campus, off-campus, West campus. East Campus — in
represented.
The Senate believes in education and devotion to the higher scholarly ideals of this
institution of higher education, but the Senate also believes in having a good time. We
recommend a YES vote for the Party Fund.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: YES
The second part of the Party Fund fee pays for the Winter quarter party, which in
cludes a live band.
The Party Fund asked us to divide their Fee so that you could vote to have parties
without having to commit so much money in one chunk. We like parties, so we think
you should vote YES on both parts.

Stanford Axe Committee
Amount Requested: $21,363
Sponsors: Scott Roth, Michael Tuchin
Statement In Favor
With the return of the traditional Big Game Bonfire, a festive parade in San Fran
cisco and enthusiasm at football games like never before, the spirit at Stanford has
never been greater.
Through the hard work of the Stanford Axe Committee, these aforementioned
events were tremendous successes. For once, all Stanford students could put their aca
demic rigors aside for one week and unite.
True, the Bonfire was fun, but it wa* very expensive. Rising insurance and material
costs could once again remove the Bonfire from the Lagunita lakebed and place it
back in our memories.
The Axe Committee is more than just the Bonfire. The Axe Committee is respon
sible for the quarterly desk blotter, containing all University telephone numbers as
well as the schedules for sporting events, Sunday Night Flicks and many other things.
Most importantly, the Axe Committee maintains the Stanford Axe, the symbol of
the traditional rivalry between Stanford and U.C.-Berkeley.
It is important to consider that the Axe Committee does receive a large amount of
non-student financial support. Despite this, however, this fee assessment is vital if the
Axe Committee is to continue to program such events for the Stanford community.
When you consider if your money is being well-spent, remember that the Bonfire was
one of the biggest events on campus in recent years.
We wholeheartedly urge you to vote yes on the Axe Committee's fee request
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Axe Committee promotes Stanford spirit and roots for Stanford athletics all
year round, but especially in the week before the Big Game with Berkeley. This fee
will pay for part of the Big Game Week activities — the Bonfire, the march in San
Francisco, and rooting at the Big Game itself.
Last Fall's bonfire in Lake Lag was a roaring success, garnering high attendance and
media attention. But it was improvised on a shoestring budget, and without adequate
funding it cannot happen again. The Rally in San Francisco seems to be on a secure
footing once more, thanks in part to student-funded rally monitors. Axe security is vi
tal to make sure the Weenies can't steal the trophy that is so rightfully ours (and that
we have been able to steal so often from them).
The Axe Committee has a lean budget and a talented, experienced, and enthusiastic
leadership. The Senate heartily recommends a YES vote for the Axe Committee.

The Stanford Daily
Amount Requested: Part I — $12,114
Part II — $27,886
Sponsor: David Benwell
Statement In Favor
The Stanford Daily is requesting $40,000 for 1986-87, the same amount The Daily
received in 1985-86. With approximately 165 issues per year, Stanford students will
pay only 2 cents per issue.
Contrary to popular opinion and to the opinion of the ASS>U, the fee assessment
does not sit in The Daily's piggybank to be drawn upon in the event of emergency. The
money The Daily receives from the student fee assessment is used to fund operations
and pay the day-to-day expenses incurred in producing the paper. While over 90% of
The Daily's revenues are generated from advertising sales, funds received from the fee
assessment are necessary to enable The Daily to pay all of its production costs. Since
The Daily operates on a fine line between profit and loss, the fee assessment is crucial
in keeping The Daily financially solvent.
During 1984-85, The Daily lost $26,000. This year, The Daily is expected to be
marginally profitable. Should The Daily not receive its fee assessment for 1986-87,
The Daily runs the risk of continuing to incur operating losses, which would result in a
reduction of The Daily's ability to serve the interests of the Stanford community.
Specifically, should The Daily's request not pass, the Stanford community could ex
pect to see the following changes in the editorial content of the newspaper:
• Fewer articles, photos, opinions, and letters would appear in The Daily. A greater
percentage of the content of the paper would be advertisements.
• The editorial expansion currently underway would have to be halted. Departments
such as science, books, diversions and entertainment would suffer.
• Coverage of intramural and club sports would be reduced.
In addition, any threat to The Daily's financial health would reduce the paper's abil
ity to continue to attract good writers and editors.
To remain one of the best independent college newspapers in the country, the Daily
needs the support of Stanford students. While advertising revenues make up a great
proportion of The Daily's operating budget, the fee assessment is necessary to restore
The Daily to financial health. Only through the support of students can The Daily con
tinue to provide complete coverage of the Stanford community.
Statement In Opposition — Part I
Richard Beigel, ASSU senator
Look at the very last column of the Daily's budget, four lines from the bottom. Do
you see that number? You know, the 6-digit number beginning with a nine: Nine
hundred and eighty-eight thousand, five hundred ninety-one dollars. Can you say
that? Can you even fit it on your calculator? That's the Daily's total estimated ex
penses for next year.
OK, now look at the number just to the left of that one. It looks kind of the same,
doesn't it? That's the Daily's total estimated income for next year, and it's a teeny
weeny bit smaller than their expenses.
Now look one more number to the left. Do you see that little number? It looks kind
of lonely and out of place among all those bigger numbers, doesn't it? That's how
much money the Daily needs from the students in order to break even next year.
If they don't get that money then the poor little Stanford Daily Corporation will
have to cut down on the size of their newspaper. And then they might have to cut out
those exciting storie about USC women basketball stars, those mouth-watering
reviews of $60-dollar-dinner restaurants, those informative accounts of what hap
pened at the last faculty senate meeting, those even more informative corrections to
what happened at the last faculty senate meeting, those intriguing features about un
dergraduates doing DN A research on butterflies in Jasper Ridge, or maybe even those
hilariously funny Mem Strips.
How does that make you feel about giving your hard-earned bucks to the Daily? I
know how it makes me feel... but if I put that in writing, the Daily might write a nasty
editorial about me.
How much is the Daily asking you to pay on a per-issue basis? They say that it is
about one cent per issue. That's the same price as two rubber bands, 30 sheets of toilet
paper, or one-quarter of a piece of chewing gum (including tax). Now, isn't the Daily
really worth that much?
Well, maybe.
Senate Recommendation, Part I: NO
The Daily's request has been divided into two parts; the first is for $12,114, the
second for $27,886. This recommendation will deal with the first part only. •
The Daily claims that it needs this money in order to break even next year* and they
can produce a massive array of numbers to support their claim. While the Senate
agrees with their addition, the Senate believes that their estimates are overly conserva
tive. The Daily has outperformed its own estimates in recent years. Over the last two
years the Daily has had profits of approximately $75,000. We think it very likely that
the Daily will make a comfortable profit next year without the monetary assistance of
the student body.
Furthermore, the Senate noted that the Daily's payroll costs it over $200,000 (that
alone is more than three times the size of the largest fee assessment on the ballot),
without even counting more than $ 100,000 dollars in commissions on ad sales.
The Daily's total expenses are nearly one million dollars. This Fee request is just a
drop in their bucket (less than one percent of their total expenses). In the unlikely
event that the Daily's conservative income predictions come true, the loss of this fee
money could easily come out of their reserves, or in the worst case it might mean that
the Daily became one page shorter every two weeks.
Since the Daily doesn't really need your money, the Senate recommends that you
vote no on this first part of the Daily's Fee request.
Statement In Opposition — Part II
If you voted yes on section I, then you're already bailing out the poor little million
dollar-a-year Stanford Daily Corporation. Those guys even have the nerve to ask you
to give them an extra $30,000 so that they can put it into their savings account.
Is this a one-time request, just to give them reserves that will protect them against
unexpected hardships? Not at all. We gave them $20,000 last year to put into their
reserves. If the Daily turned off its presses today, it would have over $200,000 (look,
there's another six-digit number) in profits. But they will ask us to give them more
money for their reserves every year.
You were smart enough to get into Stanford. You can think of better things to do
with your money. You could keep it. You could give it to charity. You could feed it to
your dog.
Don't give it to the Daily.
Senate Recommendation, Part II: NO
Because of the concerns the Senate had about appropriating the first $12,000 for
the Daily, we feel that students should definitely not be asked to give any more just to
fund a budget reserve. If this $29,000 were passed also, it would be placed directly into
the Daily's reserves, which are already quite large.
The Senate therefore gives a NO recommendation to the Daily's second request.

Stanford Glee Club
Amount Requested: $9,407
Sponsors: Eric Richardson, Michael West
Statement In Favor
To promote international cultural exchange and support music at Stanford, the
Stanford Glee Club urges a yes vote on the group's fee assessment request.
The Glee Club has been offered an opportunity to represent Stanford on a tour be
hind the Iron Curtain next spring. Friendship Ambassadors, a NY-based exchange
firm, will make arrangements to take the singers from West Germany into Eastern
Europe on a two-week tour. The emphasis of the Glee Club's visit will be to introduce
jazz, pop and folk music to the people of Romania.
But we can't spread the reputation of Stanford behind the Iron Curtain without fi
nancial support. This fee request will enable the Glee Club to get to West Germany
and back. Members of the group and Friendship Ambassadors will take care of the rest
of the financing.
Your support of the Glee Club's request will:
Promote International Cultural Exchange — Americans don't get to travel in the
Eastern bloc that often and the tour will allow students to enrich Stanford with first
hand observations about life behind the Iron Curtain. It will also give Romanians a
glimpse of America and a sampling of some great music.
Support Music at Stanford — In addition to touring Eastern Europe, the fee assess
ment will allow the Glee Club to continue to perform for Stanford and the surrounding
community. "Gigs" on the group's 1986 performance calendar include: Tresidder
Noon Concerts, Campus Christmas Caroling, Dorm Concerts and our Annual Spring
Concert in Dir.kelspiel. New director Michael West has changed the group's focus to
jazz music in an effort to increase the group's exposure and make its performances
more enjoyable to the Stanford community.
Provide ASSU Funds for the First Time in Ten Years — the Glee Club does not ask
for ASSU funding every year. We are primarily self-supporting, with club members
paying dues to cover music and other costs. But large projects like this one force us to
seek support from the student body as a whole. Best of all, we have presented a very
conservative budget: Support of the Glee Club will cost less than a dollar per student
for 1986-87.
Statement In Opposition
Eric M. Berg
The Glee Club wants to send 17 of its members to Europe, and wants the student
body to pay $9,400 to allow them to go. This trip provides absolutely no benefit to the
remaining 13,000 or so Stanford students who wont get to go to Europe with the Glee
Club, and so there's no reason that we should be asked to pay for it.
The last time the Glee Club requested funding from the student body was in Spring
1982. In that election, there were 17 fee requests on the ballot. Sixteen of these
passed, while the Glee Club's was defeated by a 3-to-1 margin. Since that time, their
reasons for requesting funds from the student body obviously haven't improved. If we
turn this one down, maybe they'll leave us alone for another four years. Vote no!
Senate Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to sing in Eastern Europe this summer, and they wantyow to
pay for it. Well, the Senate doesn't believe in funding activities that benefit only seven
teen students, particularly when the activity takes place off campus. Furthermore, the
last time the Glee Club requested a Special Fee, it was defeated overwhelmingly. We
urge you to do the same. Vote NO on paying for this group's vacation.

Stanford-In-Government
Amount Requested: $24,236
Sponsor: Bob Mat hew
Statement In Favor
Stanford-in-Government (SIG) is a voluntary student organization that assists stu
dents in finding meaningful public sector internships in both Washington, D.C. and
Sacramento. Additionally, SIG has been dedicated to stimulating campus debate on is
sues of political concern by coordinating symposia and sponsoring speakers on public
policy issues. A brief outline of SlG's programs and services follows:

1) Public Policy forum. Throughout the year, Stanford-in-Government coordinates
debates and symposia on public policy-related issues. In the past, the Public Policy
Forum has sponsored or co-sponsored addresses by Walter Mondale, Ralph Nader,
Edward Kennedy, and Gary Hart. As part of the Great Decisions Series, SIG has pre
sented symposia on important public policy issues featuring leading experts from the
media, diplomatic corps, and academia.
2) Internship Information. SIG compiles a complete, accurate, and current list of
public service internships available in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento for the com
ing year. SIG assists undergraduate and graduate students in their job search.
3) Fellowship Program. SIG annually places Stanford students on Congressional
Committees where they have a unique opportunity to participate in the legislative
processes. During 1985-86, SIG will award stipends for fellowship positions with the
Office of Technology Assessment, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Rules
Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the USTR. The program is
funded entirely through alumni contributions.
4) Housing. SIG contacts alumni in the Washington area who might wish to house a
Stanford student for the summer. By April, the SIG office provides a list of house
sitting jobs and other low-cost housing options. SIG also offers the "Georgetown Op
tion," which places students in Georgetown University apartments.
5) Lobbying. In early spring, three members of the SIG Board travel to Washington,
D.C. to lobby for students on an individual basis. Unlike our Eastern counterparts,
Stanford students are often unable to personally interview for positions. The SIG lob
byists represent Stanford applicants and strongly promote their acceptance.
6) Financial Aid. SIG grants financial aid to students who otherwise would be
unable to accept a summer internship. This program is funded through alumni support.
1) Summer Activities. SIG sponsors educational and social activities in Washington,
D.C. This has included gatherings with Senators, Representatives, White House offi
cials, and journalists. Past programs have featured famous Washingtonians such as
Sandra Day O'Connor, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Howard Baker, and George Will.
Stanford-in-Government's programs accommodate students with a wide variety of
interests, from prospective Congressional interns, to pre-meds interested in working at
the National Institutes of Health, to graduate students attracted by our Great Deci
sions Speaker program.
Senate Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government provides a variety of useful programs which encourage
and facilitate student involvement in state and Federal government. It serves as a
clearing-house for information about internship opportunities in government, and it
organizes an annual "lobby trip" which helps students arrange Washington summer
internships.
All of Stanford-in-Government's Special Fee will be used for operating expenses.
The student stipend paid to interns will be financed exclusively through outside contri
butions.
Stanford-in-Government activities tie in well to the current enthusiasm for public
service. The Senate recommends that you vote YES for Stanford-in-Government.

The Women's Center
Amount Requested: $12,453
Sponsor: Millicent Bogert
Statement In Favor
The basic purpose of the Women's Center is to serve and support the women at
Stanford of various backgrounds and interests and to develop a focus for the women's
community. These goals are met in two ways. First, we maintain a physical space with
various services and resources within. We are open every afternoon so students can
drop in to talk, use our resources, or just study. This year we have been joined by a
University-supported half-time coordinator with whose help we are working to ex
pand our resources, outreach, networking and programming in order to serve a
broader base of the community. As a center, we provide space for many organizations
dealing with women's concerns, such as REP, SURE, Aurora, Stanford Feminist Un
ion, and the Self-Defense for Women classes. The center has organized a weekly sup
port group where women can gather to share personal concerns. We provide resources
and information on jobs, health care, sources of crisis help, campus events, and politi
cal issues. The center houses an ever-growing library of books and periodicals by and
for women. The collection includes biography, fiction, poetry, women's history,
writings by women of color, feminist theory, and other texts pertinent to all women.
Second, we plan programs both in the center itself and in other locations on campus.
This year, with the Third World Women's Caucus, we helped to bring women who had
been to the UN Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya; we co-sponsored Marilyn
Waring from New Zealand, who has been active in women's rights and the nuclear free
zone movement; we sponsored the Women in Science and Engineering Series in which
we invited women from those fields to come and talk with us about their experiences in
male-dominated fields. Winter quarter our series on Women of Color addressed issues
of discrimination and assimilation and we celebrated Virginia Woolfs birthday. This
spring we are bringing two prominent authors to Stanford, Marge Piercy and Cherrie
Moraga. It is worth noting that all of these events are free and open to the entire com
munity.
We are excited about the series planned for next year: Women in Athletics, Mother
ing/Child Care, Women Humorists as Social Commentators, and a film series. The
Women's Center continues to provide valuable services to the community. The center
functions as a presence which is supportive and responsive to the fluctuating needs of
all Stanford students.
Senate Recommendation: YES
The Stanford Women's Center is a resource center designed to meet the variety of
needs and interests of both graduate and undergraduate women at Stanford, The pro
gramming planned for 1986-87, especially the Women's Humorists Series, promises to
be of interest to both women and men of the Stanford community. The Senate heartily
recommends a YES vote for the Women's Center. n ' *

SURE
Amount Requested: $18,176
Sponsor: Julie Ann Yuen
Senate Recommendation: YES
SURE (Stanford United for Rape Elimination) was established a few years ago as a
volunteer organization concerned with women's safety on campus. Since that time
volunteer escorts (either one man or a team of two women) have been replaced by
salaried male drivers. The Senate is concerned about this change as well as questions
about its reliability this past year.
In addition, while the service is undoubtedly valuable in preventing attacks on
women, the organization has done little to decrease the hesitancy some women feel in
using the service. Despite these reservation* we feel that SU RE is an asset to the com
munity, and we recommend a YES vote.
