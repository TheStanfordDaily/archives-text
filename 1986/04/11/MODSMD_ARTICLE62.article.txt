# SENATE CANDIDATE STATEMENTS
## Undergraduate Senate Candidates 
### 
Leonard Adler
Freshman, Computer Science and Public Policy
(tentative)
Founder/president of The Stanford Collectors Club —
Fall, Winter Quarters 1985-86; Secretary, Roble Hall
— Fall, Winter Quarters 1985-86
The ASSU Senate is here to serve Stanford students.
As Senator my goal will be to make your life at Stan
ford just a little easier and a lot more enjoyable. I
already have some ideas which I think could improve
Stanford life such as: installing change machines in
dorms and having more Faculty Night Dinners (to in
crease student-teacher interaction). I also plan to make
myself accessible to students and listen to any sugges
tions you might have, because with your help (and a
vote for guess who) the Senate, while it still exists, just
might get something done.
Eric Allen
Sophomore, undeclared
President, Larkin House (Spring '85)
Senators have come and gone for years now, but the
problems of the Senate have remained the same — in
effectiveness, mass bureaucracy, and poor communica
tion with the students. It may be time to overhaul the
structure of the Senate. My responsibility as a Senator
will be to propose and support policies that finally
streamline the Senate and create a system in which the
Stanford community is effectively served. We can
establish a responsive and efficient Senate.
On a personal level, I intend to be a Senator noted
for his fair-mindedness and interest in the will of the
students.
Joel Lloyd Bellenson
Senior, Biology and International Relations
Current bureaucrat in ASSU; on Special Investigative
Committee re: Police Brutality; sponsored bill to make
Stanford a sanctuary; sponsored bill to place ASSU di
vestment on ballot; Member of COP of Stanford Hillel;
Member of SOS A; Member of Stanford Humanist Or
ganization; Student Member of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR)
In the beginning, after humans emerged from the
primordial slime, people existed in various states and
social structures. However, it came to pass that
bureaucracies proliferated and our human potential
was limited by the constraints of systems designed by
the greedy and the power hungry. Later a university in
Northern California appeared that followed this pat
tern. One reluctant individual, Joel, tried his hand at
combatting the values that predominated. And he
enjoyed moderate success. ASSU Divestment. Sanctu
ary. Statements in support of SWOPSI. Police Review
Board. Etcetera.
And so it came to pass that he sought re-election.
Give Joel a chance.
Danny Berns
Sophomore
Member, ASSU Committee on Undergraduate Resi
dential Education
The ASSU Senate should devote less time to rules
and regulations and more time to aiding student organi
zations. For example, changes need to be made in the
Funding Process so as to eliminate an inherently flawed
three-step procedure that is both time-consuming and

unfair. Organizations are forced to deal with the Pro
gram Board, the Appropriations Committee, and the
entire Senate, all of which wish to allocate different
amounts, before receiving any funding. A more simple
process is needed. Furthermore, I feel the ASSU needs
to continue its initiative in worthwhile service projects,
such as the Boat House.
Renee Blake
Junior, Biology
Coalition on Minority Admissions — central commit
tee; Tutorial/Motivational Program for East Palo Alto
Youths — co-coordinator
Students as well as all of mankind deserve the right to
grow and educate themselves in a system that is just
and allows for self-determination. My role as an ASSU
senator will be to represent all students in their
struggles to have their ideas heard, considered and im
plemented. I shall demand that the nature of our edu
cation at Stanford, the quality of community relations
and social responsibility be seriously addressed. It's
time to have Stanford take responsibility for its actions,
especially since we have the capability of making a pos
itive difference in our community and the world around
us.
Larry "Bear" Bloch
Junior, Biology
ASSU Senator '85-'B6; Chairman of ASSU Adminis
tration and Rules Committee '85-'B6; Chairman of
ASSU Undergraduate and Residential Education
Committee '85-'B6; ASSU Steering Committee '85-
'86; Student Conduct Legislative Council '85-'B6;
Koret Public Policy Symposium Fund '85-'B6; Concert
Network Advisory Board '85-'B6
While serving in the Senate, I have become con
vinced that the ASSU can best serve students by being
responsive to their needs and concerns throughout the
year. This means working to fund student groups who
make our university a community instead 'of just a
campus as well as forcefully communicating the stu
dents' views to the administration. The ASSU works
best when it facilitates the implementation of student
initiated projects instead of attempting to divine stu
dent wishes and generate the programs as service
projects. Student government knows how to get things
done, but students know what needs to be done.
Darrel Keith Brown
Junior, Mechanical Engineering
Tresidder Store Concept Group
Stanford is an institution of tremendous potential.
Too many times, however, it is not as accessible as it
should be to the very students it seeks. With the vast re
sources of Stanford University, both financial and intel
lectual, Stanford has an obligation to be at the forefront
of the social, cultural, and political issues that confront
us as students. As an ASSU senator, I would endeavor
to bring about a higher level of accessibility, constantly
alluded to but never achieved. As a community of stu
dents we owe it to ourselves to support the kinds of
diverse programming that can only serve to increase
our perspective.

George "Felix" Cuevas
Junior, Spanish and Education
Coordinator of Barrio Assistance; Editor of Estos
Tiempos
As a senator, I will work to make the Senate more
accountable to the Stanford student populace. I wish to
promote respect and understanding of the numerous
and varied student groups among the senators and the
rest of the campus. I will especially work to get student
community service groups to be recognized as an offi
cial part of Stanford University. I will espouse the
ideals put forth in "The People's Platform," written by
a coalition of individuals and student groups interested
in creating a more socially reponsible Stanford Univer
sity.
Jim Eliassen
Sophomore, undeclared
In deciding to run for the Senate I took into account
two things. First of all, I know very little about the func
tion of the ASSU apart from Sunday Flicks, ASSU
lecture notes, and refunds. Secondly, from my experi
ence I feel this is representative of many students at
Stanford. This may be a sign of apathy toward student
government or just that there is a lack of information
readily available for students to learn about general
ASSU functions. As a senator I would like to find ways
of improving student awareness of and involvement
with the ASSU.
Stacey Estrella
Sophomore, undeclared (prospective Economics major)
Stanford-in-Government — member of the Public
Policy Forum
As a member of the undergraduate senate, I would
like to clear up much of the confusion among the stu
dent body regarding the purpose of the ASSU and to
establish for the ASSU a positive rapport with the stu
dents at Stanford.
An understanding, on the part of the students, re
garding the organization's contribution to social
interaction and exchange through the financial support
of various student services and groups, will create a
more positive outlook for the ASSU.
In regard to the funding of student groups and
services, I am supportive to any group whose members
find their participation worthwhile. As long as these
groups are also made accessible to interested students,
these organizations are worth the time, effort, and
money which goes into allocating the ASSU's available
resources.
Ben Garcia
Junior, Electrical Engineering
Treasurer, Stanford Society of Chicano Engineers and
Scientists; Stanford Democrats; Stanford Newman
Choir; MEChA
I would like to promote change in the bureaucratic
methods in which Stanford conducts policy-making.
Students should have an easier ability to communicate
thefir concerns and needs in areas like: Housing, Finan
cial Aids, and Food Service. As expressed in The
People's Platform, Stanford's policies are not
responsive to the concerns of all members of the com
munity, especially those of minorities, progressives, and
women. I would like to change Stanford's: nonexistent
effort to come to the defense of Ethnic Studies and
