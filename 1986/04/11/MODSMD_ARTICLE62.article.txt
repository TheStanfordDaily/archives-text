## Undergraduate Senate Candidates 
### 
Leonard Adler
Freshman, Computer Science and Public Policy
(tentative)
Founder/president of The Stanford Collectors Club —
Fall, Winter Quarters 1985-86; Secretary, Roble Hall
— Fall, Winter Quarters 1985-86
The ASSU Senate is here to serve Stanford students.
As Senator my goal will be to make your life at Stan
ford just a little easier and a lot more enjoyable. I
already have some ideas which I think could improve
Stanford life such as: installing change machines in
dorms and having more Faculty Night Dinners (to in
crease student-teacher interaction). I also plan to make
myself accessible to students and listen to any sugges
tions you might have, because with your help (and a
vote for guess who) the Senate, while it still exists, just
might get something done.
Eric Allen
Sophomore, undeclared
President, Larkin House (Spring '85)
Senators have come and gone for years now, but the
problems of the Senate have remained the same — in
effectiveness, mass bureaucracy, and poor communica
tion with the students. It may be time to overhaul the
structure of the Senate. My responsibility as a Senator
will be to propose and support policies that finally
streamline the Senate and create a system in which the
Stanford community is effectively served. We can
establish a responsive and efficient Senate.
On a personal level, I intend to be a Senator noted
for his fair-mindedness and interest in the will of the
students.
Joel Lloyd Bellenson
Senior, Biology and International Relations
Current bureaucrat in ASSU; on Special Investigative
Committee re: Police Brutality; sponsored bill to make
Stanford a sanctuary; sponsored bill to place ASSU di
vestment on ballot; Member of COP of Stanford Hillel;
Member of SOS A; Member of Stanford Humanist Or
ganization; Student Member of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR)
In the beginning, after humans emerged from the
primordial slime, people existed in various states and
social structures. However, it came to pass that
bureaucracies proliferated and our human potential
was limited by the constraints of systems designed by
the greedy and the power hungry. Later a university in
Northern California appeared that followed this pat
tern. One reluctant individual, Joel, tried his hand at
combatting the values that predominated. And he
enjoyed moderate success. ASSU Divestment. Sanctu
ary. Statements in support of SWOPSI. Police Review
Board. Etcetera.
And so it came to pass that he sought re-election.
Give Joel a chance.
Danny Berns
Sophomore
Member, ASSU Committee on Undergraduate Resi
dential Education
The ASSU Senate should devote less time to rules
and regulations and more time to aiding student organi
zations. For example, changes need to be made in the
Funding Process so as to eliminate an inherently flawed
three-step procedure that is both time-consuming and

unfair. Organizations are forced to deal with the Pro
gram Board, the Appropriations Committee, and the
entire Senate, all of which wish to allocate different
amounts, before receiving any funding. A more simple
process is needed. Furthermore, I feel the ASSU needs
to continue its initiative in worthwhile service projects,
such as the Boat House.
Renee Blake
Junior, Biology
Coalition on Minority Admissions — central commit
tee; Tutorial/Motivational Program for East Palo Alto
Youths — co-coordinator
Students as well as all of mankind deserve the right to
grow and educate themselves in a system that is just
and allows for self-determination. My role as an ASSU
senator will be to represent all students in their
struggles to have their ideas heard, considered and im
plemented. I shall demand that the nature of our edu
cation at Stanford, the quality of community relations
and social responsibility be seriously addressed. It's
time to have Stanford take responsibility for its actions,
especially since we have the capability of making a pos
itive difference in our community and the world around
us.
Larry "Bear" Bloch
Junior, Biology
ASSU Senator '85-'B6; Chairman of ASSU Adminis
tration and Rules Committee '85-'B6; Chairman of
ASSU Undergraduate and Residential Education
Committee '85-'B6; ASSU Steering Committee '85-
'86; Student Conduct Legislative Council '85-'B6;
Koret Public Policy Symposium Fund '85-'B6; Concert
Network Advisory Board '85-'B6
While serving in the Senate, I have become con
vinced that the ASSU can best serve students by being
responsive to their needs and concerns throughout the
year. This means working to fund student groups who
make our university a community instead 'of just a
campus as well as forcefully communicating the stu
dents' views to the administration. The ASSU works
best when it facilitates the implementation of student
initiated projects instead of attempting to divine stu
dent wishes and generate the programs as service
projects. Student government knows how to get things
done, but students know what needs to be done.
Darrel Keith Brown
Junior, Mechanical Engineering
Tresidder Store Concept Group
Stanford is an institution of tremendous potential.
Too many times, however, it is not as accessible as it
should be to the very students it seeks. With the vast re
sources of Stanford University, both financial and intel
lectual, Stanford has an obligation to be at the forefront
of the social, cultural, and political issues that confront
us as students. As an ASSU senator, I would endeavor
to bring about a higher level of accessibility, constantly
alluded to but never achieved. As a community of stu
dents we owe it to ourselves to support the kinds of
diverse programming that can only serve to increase
our perspective.
Scott Chamness
No statement.

George "Felix" Cuevas
Junior, Spanish and Education
Coordinator of Barrio Assistance; Editor of Estos
Tiempos
As a senator, I will work to make the Senate more
accountable to the Stanford student populace. I wish to
promote respect and understanding of the numerous
and varied student groups among the senators and the
rest of the campus. I will especially work to get student
community service groups to be recognized as an offi
cial part of Stanford University. I will espouse the
ideals put forth in "The People's Platform," written by
a coalition of individuals and student groups interested
in creating a more socially reponsible Stanford Univer
sity.
Jim Eliassen
Sophomore, undeclared
In deciding to run for the Senate I took into account
two things. First of all, I know very little about the func
tion of the ASSU apart from Sunday Flicks, ASSU
lecture notes, and refunds. Secondly, from my experi
ence I feel this is representative of many students at
Stanford. This may be a sign of apathy toward student
government or just that there is a lack of information
readily available for students to learn about general
ASSU functions. As a senator I would like to find ways
of improving student awareness of and involvement
with the ASSU.
Stacey Estrella
Sophomore, undeclared (prospective Economics major)
Stanford-in-Government — member of the Public
Policy Forum
As a member of the undergraduate senate, I would
like to clear up much of the confusion among the stu
dent body regarding the purpose of the ASSU and to
establish for the ASSU a positive rapport with the stu
dents at Stanford.
An understanding, on the part of the students, re
garding the organization's contribution to social
interaction and exchange through the financial support
of various student services and groups, will create a
more positive outlook for the ASSU.
In regard to the funding of student groups and
services, I am supportive to any group whose members
find their participation worthwhile. As long as these
groups are also made accessible to interested students,
these organizations are worth the time, effort, and
money which goes into allocating the ASSU's available
resources.
Ben Garcia
Junior, Electrical Engineering
Treasurer, Stanford Society of Chicano Engineers and
Scientists; Stanford Democrats; Stanford Newman
Choir; MEChA
I would like to promote change in the bureaucratic
methods in which Stanford conducts policy-making.
Students should have an easier ability to communicate
thefir concerns and needs in areas like: Housing, Finan
cial Aids, and Food Service. As expressed in The
People's Platform, Stanford's policies are not
responsive to the concerns of all members of the com
munity, especially those of minorities, progressives, and
women. I would like to change Stanford's: nonexistent
effort to come to the defense of Ethnic Studies and
Theme Houses, negligible efforts in recruiting minority
and women professors, and unfair treatment of the
United Stanford Workers.
Matt Gallagher
Sophomore, Human Biology
84-'BS — House president Autumn Quarter, Donner;
'85-'B6— IM representative, Newman Center; '85-'B6
— Assistant Chairman, Big Game Bonfire (Axe Com
mittee); '85-'B6— Lathrop House president
I seek to represent the student body at Stanford in
terms of attitudes and goals. I feel that my involvement
in several other activities on campus (i.e. crew, Axe
Committee, Newman Center, Human Biology) qualify
me to act as an active and informed representative and
one who will make decisions that are best for the
greatest number of people. Simply, I'm fascinated by
my fellow students of Stanford — I enjoy getting to
know them, and working with them, so involvement is
natural. I'm excited about the responsibility and experi
ence that a prospective ASSU senatorship demands
and feel that I can contribute positively.
Hubert Ho
Freshman, undeclared
Senate? Who's in it? Where is it? Who in the hell
cares? I care, arid you should too. Today's Senate lacks
the necessary rapport with the students of Stanford.
(That's what the S's stand for in ASSU.) Treating the
students like peons, many of the Senators act like
pretentious facilitators. Bullshit! The Senate needs to
adopt a more visible role rather than its bureaucratic
closet position. Along with its control of finances, the
Senate should sponsor activities promoting unity
around campus. A real student center is needed to give
students a place to go. Senators should be accessible to
report Senate actions with your money to any groups
requesting such information.
Lisa Hulber
Freshman, undeclared
Public relations chairman, Stanford Glee Club '85-'B6;
Dorm council, Burbank House; Energy representative,
Burbank House
I feel that there is too much bureaucracy in the
ASSU and would like to institute changes in the Consti
tution to rectify this problem. I would also like to see
the ASSU made more accessible to the student body.
The students have valuable ideas and can make a con
tribution even if they choose not to seek an office in the
Senate. The ASSU has been instituted to serve the stu
dents and greater student input would foster such a
goal. If elected, I will work actively to make the ASSU
a better representation of the student body.
Mike Ivanitsky
Freshman, undeclared
Undergraduate Senate Associate, Oct. 1985-present;
Senate Associates Committee, Oct. 1985-present; Stu
dent Affairs Committee, Nov. 1985-present
As I see it, the Senate has two roles: to represent stu
dents' opinions to the "powers that be," and to support
activities which benefit all students.
The hottest issues concerning student opinion are di
vestment, and "Sanctuary," both of which 1 support. A
police review board is a must, in view of recent civil
rights violations. The Senate must not relent in its con
flicts with university administration.
I think we should fund any group which enhances life
at Stanford. I favor the new Constitution, since it forces
Senators to re-discover their real purpose: to serve stu
dents. ' . .

Susan H. Jancso (Otis) (Uzi)
Freshman, undeclared
Please vote for me. Thank you.
William King
Sophomore, Biology
Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization, central com
mittee member (Spring 1986-Winter 1987); Real
News, literary editor; University Subcommittee on Dis
tribution Requirements
Yes, I would rather be watching Gilligan's Island
than running for Senate. I'm running because I want
someone who can be held accountable, and will bring
up issues not always considered by the ASSU. "Why
does much of the minority community feel dis
regarded?" "Why are 'Third World' issues considered
'special interest group' issues?" As a black student, I
feel I have a very important perspective to bring to the
ASSU Senate. I will try to voice the concerns not only
of the minority community at Stanford, but the whole
concerned student body. I'm running to represent
people, not interests.
Michael Lee
Freshman, undeclared
I'm running for Senate because when I was little, kids
used to call me "Michael, Michael Motorcycle." And
I'm sick of it. I also want to make things easier and
more accessible; the current COP has moved nobly in
that direction, but we need to push further. Issues come
and go, but we can never get at them effectively when
they are veiled by bureaucracy and a lack of knowledge
of what the students really want. Rest assured that what
I can do will be done — I'm not gonna pussyfoot
around, punk. If Clint can do it, why can't I?
Rona Legmann
Freshman, International Relations
Member of Stanford-in-Government; Photographer
for "Stanford Quad" (yearbook); Peer Counselor at
the Bridge
Don't you hate it when you're not sure what exactly
your Student Senate does in its weekly meetings, let
alone, who your Senators even are? 000 ... I know I
hate that Perhaps that is why I'm writing today. In this
election I hope to convey to you my desire to be a
member of the Senate. I want to make each of you
aware of the issues your representatives support and to
make the Senate more accessible. Don't just sit back
and let a couple people determine your fate. Express
your desires and concerns; I'll be there to acknowledge
them.
Stacey Leyton
Sophomore, History
Member of: Sanctuary at Stanford; Stanford Central
American Action Network; Stanford Out of South
Africa; Student Labor Support Committee
I have been active in progressive politics since arriv
ing at Stanford; currently I am working to make Stan
ford a sanctuary for Central American refugees. I am
running to uphold the "People's Platform," a call for
change written in a convention by Third World and
progressive students. As senator, I will especially
promote issues of social responsibility (such as divest
ment) and of education (like shifting resources from
Western Culture to Ethnic Studies). Student govern
ment must actually represent and be accountable to stu
dents. 1 will be accountable and I want your vote on the
basis of the issues of the People's Platform.
Christopher "Jake" Madden
Sophomore

Abe said that you can't please all of the people all of
the time and I've always found this to be true. The most
I can do is keep an open mind, work hard, be conscien
tious, stick with it, and then hope for the best. That is
all I can promise.
Brett Mahoney
Sophomore, planned majors: Psychology and Interna
tional Relations
President, Capoeira Club 1984-85; Speaker for the
Beyond War Organization 1984-85; Peer Counselor at
Ujamaa and Bridge 1986
VOTE AWARENESS
University Awareness - Students
Students invest a great deal of money, time and
themselves into their stay at Stanford. Stanford should
reflect this input. Students must be allowed greater in
fluence concerning the formation of University policy.
Our needs must be met.
Awareness - Dignity
Respect must be maintained for the dignity of all
Stanford students. This respect includes a sensitivity to
minority groups and firm support of theme houses and
their programs.
Awareness - Resources
Many resources are available to students here, which
we may not even be aware of. These resources must be
maintained and publicized.
VOTE AWARENESS — VOTE MAHONEY
Rick T. Mikkelson
Freshman, undeclared
The ASSU Senate can do a better job of living up to
its leadership responsibilities. It is uniquely qualified to
lead students in promoting a moral justice, starting
right here on campus. Yet it seems hesitant to fulfill this
role.
To be sure, some have tried to facilitate such leader
ship. But for the ASSU to fully realize its potential will
require senators who direct their decisions toward this
higher calling.
Rick Mikkelson will be such a senator.
Chris Nadan
Sophomore, undeclared
2/85-10/85, Authorized Student Representative, Bran
ner. All-University Speakers Forum
The ASSU senate must represent student interests to
the University. Thus communication and efficiency
play important roles. I will replace petty power
struggles and bureaucracy with dedication and results.
In addition, the senate provides another vital service,
the distribution of money. I will streamline the funding
process, making it more responsive and equitable. The
ASSU must properly allocate funding, because many
varied student services and organizations depend on
ASSU funds for survival. With over $1,000,000 in as
sets, the ASSU can potentially do great things with
your money. My goal is to use it properly and realize
our potential.
David Porter
Senior, Industrial Engineering
ASSU president; chair, Black Community Services
Center Policy Board; ASSU senator; chair, Appropria
tions Committee; deputy chair, Nominations Commis
sion; administrative assistant, ASSU Council of

associate, Ujamaa; financial manager, Black Liberation
Month Planning Commission; treasurer, Blyth Fund;
member, Committee of Fifteen; member, Tresidder
Food Committee; treasurer, Alpha Phi Alpha Frater
nity, Inc.; member, SCLC
The ASSU governance structure is in need of much
review. If I am elected I will work to streamline the
structure and eliminate a lot of the bureaucratic red
tape. I will work primarily with the services which the
ASSU provides and attempt to make them more useful
to the student body. These areas include student or
ganization funding and programming such as Speakers
Bureau.

Vern Shure
Junior, Economics
Co-director of the Comedy Club of Stanford University
(1986); Member of the Committee of Fifteen (1985-
86)
The majority of undergraduates feel detached from
their student government. The Senate has done a poor
job representing students in the recent past simply be
cause Senators have rarely communicated with their
constituents. When is the last time a Senator came to
your house meeting? If elected I will work to foster the
kind of communication that will make Senators true
representatives of the student body. We have had
enough of empty and unrealistic campaign promises —
what Stanford needs is back-to-basics student govern
ment. We need representation in the true spirit of
democracy. I feel that I can provide such representa
tion.
Lena Slachmuijlder
Freshman, undeclared. Intended Political Sci
ence/History
Member of Stanford-in-Government; dorm discussion
leader winter and spring '86
Throughout the 1985-86 school year, I have demon
strated strong interest in making both myself and others
more aware of the political and social events surround
ing us. Though my participation has been limited to
Stanford-in-Government and the formation of a politi
cal awareness circle, Global Ed, I am confident that my
desire to continue realizing this interest will grow
stronger through my years at Stanford. I hope to bring
my high level of energy, enthusiasm, and initiative to
the Senate, where I will be able to direct these qualities
toward serving the interests of the students of Stanford.
Jeff Sloan
Sophomore, Political Science with possible double
major in Economics
Director, Internship Program, Stanford-in-
Government '85-'B6

As students, the ASSU Senate decisions affect our
lives. Making these decisions accurately and in the stu
dents' best interest requires a dedicated legislature. I
plan to give you a responsive, dedicated legislature that
will:
1) provide equitable funding for Stanford's 300+
student organizations;
2) reduce the Senate bureaucracy by proposing ad
ministrative reforms;
3) initiate more student awareness and involvement
in issues coming before the Senate.
But to do this, the present system needs changes, and
positive changes are difficult in a slow, bureaucratic
legislature. I will streamline Senate administration so
that student-desired changes can and WILL occur.
Jose Trujillo
Sophomore, Economics
I've but two goals: to assure that the ASSU provides
for the legitimate needs of all Stanford students, and to
make sure that each issue brought before the senate
receives a fair evaluation.
John van Loben Sels
Junior, Civil Engineering and Political Science
ASSU senator (1985-1986); Chairman Special Inves
tigative Committee; member, President's Committee
on Public Events
This year I worked hard for student interests both in
and out of senate meetings. When protestors were bru
talized at Old Union, I chaired the committee that
looked into the charges of misconduct. My committee
initiated and fought for a police policy review board to
help prevent future problems. When the student body
voiced its opinion on South Africa, I fought hard for a
divestment resolution. I also worked for unobstructive
funding policies for student groups. The problem is that
as an alternate senator I couldn't vote. I want to con
tinue to champion student interests with a voice that
counts.

Angela Wood

Secretary of Stanford College Republicans
Where the rolling foothills rise,
Up towards Lag and Meyer,
ASSU senate seeks new eyes,
Someone to inspire.
And you shall note,
As you vote,
The bank balance going higher.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!!!!!!
("Inspire what?" Why, new life for our governing body,
of course!)
Put some WOOD-WORK into our senate! Wood
would work for better appropriation of funds and a
more representative senate. Monetary allocations
should be preceded by careful and thorough considera
tion of a request. Services provided by ASSU must
reflect the interests of Stanford students, not merely the
whims of a few select individuals.
Vivian Wu
Sophomore, undeclared
1985-86 Asian American Student Advisor
(administrative intern for the Dean of Student Affairs)
As co-founder of the Third World Women's Caucus
and co-initiator of the People's Platform, I see the need
for Third World and progressive students to unite their
efforts in hopes of improving the quality of education at
Stanford University.
As the Asian American administrative intern and
advocate for the Asian American community at Stan
ford, I realize the importance of raising issues which af
fect Asian American students.
I unite with the People's Platform, and as an ASSU
Senator, I will do everything possible to see that the
People's Platform be addressed by the entire Stanford
community.
