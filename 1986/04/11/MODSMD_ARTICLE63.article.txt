Industrial Engineering/School of Engineering (Vf.S.l.£.
Program "Board kepresentative ('B5-'86); University
Committee on Public Events (' 84-'B5, '85-'B6)
Having served on the Program Board, the body re
sponsible for making funding recommendations to the
Senate, I believe that a key issue next year will be con
trolling the spending of the ASSU. It is quite evident
that there is a great deal of room for fiscal conservatism
in the Senate.
As an Industrial Engineer, it is also clear to me that
the ASSU could operate with far greater efficiency. I
hope that as a Senator, I would have a positive impact
on the implementation of the new Constitution should
it pass in the current election.
Zenon Kuc
Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering
ASSU graduate senator, 1985-86

Except for approving funding of student groups, the
ASSU Senate is f---ing useless. I hate the Senate. I hate
this stupid election. (Vote 'NO' on everything, just to
show 'em.) Why am I running for Senate? I just want to
protect you from the Senate. I want to deprive some
bureaucratic oaf who wants to join in this circle jerk of
red tape. I plan on sitting there, doing my homework,
and reminding everybody how stupid they are acting.
Remember, vote 'NO 1 on everything. (Was Alex Haley
worth $3,000? Is Ijerraro worth $12,500? I don't think
so.)
Michael Strange
Mechanical Engineering — Engineer
ASSU Graduate Senator '85-'B6; Committee on
Graduate Education and Research, co-chair

I am very interested in the relationship between the
engineering community and the University as a whole. I
feel the need for proper representation of the engineer
ing community is very important since it makes up a
large part of the population. The body requires an ef
fectual voice in the decisions which impact it. As a con
tinuing senator, issues I plan on furthering my pursuit
of include: removal of taxation of tuition credits
(section 127), present graduate student housing, near
future graduate student housing. Hopefully, my contin
ued participation as an ASSU senator will contribute to
the enhancement of engineering students, students in
general and to the University.
