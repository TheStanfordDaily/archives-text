Most students are clueless when it comes to the juris
diction of the Student Conduct Legislative Council and
its relationship to the Fundamental Standard. Some
might think that this would mean everything is going
smoothly, but they would be wrong, again. It would be
a great help to students if they were informed about
what is and what is not a violation of the Fundamental
Standard as well as what the range of disciplinary action
for various violations are. The dissemination of this in
formation would help students to make more informed
decisions about their conduct within the Stanford Com
munity.

Integrity is a defining characteristic of the Stanford
community. Whether the issue be fraternities or drink
ing policy, demands are often made for more responsi
bility in conducting our affairs.
Yet, there will always be those who abuse the trust
bestowed on students. While I will be a fair member of
the SCLC, I do not believe that those who violate the
student codes should be treated leniently. Cheating es
pecially deserves harsh punishment. The actions of rule
breakers only harm students who deserve the utmost
trust.
Also, 1 think Student Conduct Legislative Council is
a really cool name.

In past years, most SCLC candidate statements have
started: "Many students don't know what the SCLC

does. .. " and they were correct, but nobody did any
thing about it. Guess what boys and girls: The SCLC
writes that long blurb on the blue books you read when
you realize that, no, Aristotle was not optional reading
in Western Culture. Yes, the one no one understands.
Wouldn't it be nice if we had an honor code every one
knew and understood, before they got expelled? 1
thought so. Let's do something about it. Vote for Erik
Lillquist.

The Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard are
part of what makes Stanford what it is â€” an outstand
ing place to go to school. If elected I will do my best to
see that Stanford's rules governing student conduct are
not compromised in any manner, and that they are
fairly and consistently applied.
