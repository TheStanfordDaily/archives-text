It was almost Senior year, and things were looking
like they would be much the same as always. Predict
able. In fact, it seemed as though the usual kind of
slates with the same ideas would be running again.
"Pub Nites, Pub Nites, and maybe even some Pub
Nites," promised one of the slates. And this was the
one with the most ideas.
But then, just when everything threatened to remain
ordinary, they came ... the SLATE OUT OF
NOWHERE — a slate of four enterprising students
willing to pool their efforts to insure that Senior year
was no longer . .. plain. They were not just a bunch of
names, they had plans, BIG plans. They were not only
thinking about Pub Nites, but also the Mausoleum
party, Casino Night, the Senior Formal, the Sierra

Camp Retreat, and Disorientation. They also had new
ideas such as a Beach Trip, Senior Tailgaters, and a big
Bar-B-Que at the Lake, to name a few. They would
publish a Senior newsletter to keep you informed,
maintain a suggestion "hotline," and make the selec
tion process of YOUR Commencement speaker more
efficient. At last, hope was in sight, and there was much
rejoicing.

SLATERHOUSE 4 or The Students' Crusade

" A truly original slate ... the best I've seen in years.
From the beginning, and throughout, this slate exerts a
powerful hold; its episodes are vivid, fun, and entranc
ing, and its style is a triumph. This work (oh, what a
crime it is to call it a "work" when these superlative
slate members seem to be handling difficult tasks with
such ease and assurance!) is one to be lieved and
relived, thought about and remembered fondly as the
years go by."
— the Stanford Times Slate Review
setting: Stanford University, Bay Area pubs, the
Mausoleum, the City
time: 1986-87
plot summary:
The epic scope of this slate covers the hilarious
mayhem of a Senior Disorientation Week to the festive
sentimentality of the Senior Formal and beyond. It is a
supremely unconventional slate based on the incredible
experiences of seniors as they travel with ease from one
senior pub night to another, occasionally hitting a ran
dom Mausoleum Party or Senior Casino Night on their
way. The intensity and unabashed fun of these events
can only be experienced to be believed.
You've read the book, now live the year.
