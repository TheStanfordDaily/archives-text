JOSH. Josh is your humble servant. He is a friend
when you need him.Jos/j is not any better than you are.
Josh doesn't tell you he should be president, or even
that he ought to be president. He says simply, "1 would
like to be president, thank you/' That's Josh.
Josh and his companions aren't the "Real Solution.
Josh doesn't believe in political "solutions." Josh
believes in saying "thank you." Josh believes in things
like peace, love, understanding, and being a real son
of-a-bitch when students are getting the short shrift.
He's a believer.
Josh is your friend. When people ask you, "Who is
your President?" don't be left muttering, "Oh, some
body and somebody and a couple other people.' Hold
your head high and say, "Josh."
"1 would appreciate your vote, and I hope that you
will drop hy the office for achat, and perhaps a snack.

The "REAL SOLUTION" Council of Presidents
slate has united a representative, concerned, and effec
tive force from diverse interests within the Stanford
community. We feel that many student needs have
gone unaddressed due to lack of communication and
effective representation. So we have committed our
selves to work for a better solution by focussing on: the
promotion of diversity, an improvement in student
services, and an increase in student participation.
Promotion of Diversity:
• Lobbying faculty and administration ttf increase the
quality of quantity of ethnic studies programs. Our long
term goal is the equal presentation of all ethnic cultures
through a World Culture Program.
• Changing Residential Education's focus on conform
ity by supporting theme houses and increasing inter
dorm programming.
• Supporting and assisting the Sanctuary Movement at
Stanford.
• Improving relations between the general community
and Stanford students by supporting social services and
community education programs with the United Stan
ford Workers and the surrounding communities such as
East Palo Alto.

Student Services:
• Creating an environment in the Program and Publica
tions Boards conducive to increase mutual respect be
tween student organizations and board members.
• Strengthening the representation and effectiveness of
students on University committees.
• Transforming Tresidder Union into a student center
and providing means for student organizations to effec
tively utilize Tresidder's services, resources, and
facilities.
Participation:
• Assisting problem areas through productive commu
nication between student organizations, minority com
munities, and the Council of Presidents.
• Creating task forces, intern positions, and special
legislative committees to study and address student
problems, issues, and needs.
• Supporting and lobbying for divestment of University
interests from South Africa along with SOS A and other
established efforts.
These are the REAL issues that need to be con
fronted. We know our limitations but are committed to
work hard with student organizations and concerned
communities to address these issues. We believe that a
united effort covering many perspectives is the only
way student strength will succeed. We will dedicate
ourselves to serve you, the Stanford community. We
will make effective, efficient, and responsible use of our
experience and community ties to provide a RE A L SO
LUTION to Stanford student concerns.
We know how to net results. We will use our time and
efforts efficiently. We are representative through diver
sity. We believe in student service.
