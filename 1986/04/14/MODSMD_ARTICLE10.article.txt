### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Saying that human beings, an environment, and two
ways of life are being wantonly destroyed," Navajo elders
and representatives of the International Indian Treaty
Council on Friday gave a presentation in protest of a fed
eral law that mandates the relocation of thousands of na
tive Americans in Arizona.
Let s stop this apartheid in Arizona, an apartheid car
ried out by our own government with our tax dollars.
1 hen let s see what we can do about the apartheid in South
Africa, uaid Carl Dalton of the International Indian
Treaty Council, referring to what he said are parallels
between the iorced separation of the Navajo and Hopi
tribes and the torced separation of African tribes because
ot the so-called "homelands" policy of the South African
government.
In the course of the presentation, it was explained that
the law, which has been condemned by the Russell Tri
bunal in Rotterdam and the 43rd session of the Human
Rights Commission in Geneva as an act of genocide, was
intended by Congress to relieve alleged disputes between
the Hopi and Navajo.
I he speakers and the text of the slide show said claims
of a dispute were fabrications. The Hopi and Navajo, they

said, have lived together peacefully for many years. They
added that the tribes knew nothing of the 1974 law until
1977 when the federal government began erecting a fence
that was to divide Hopi and Navajo territory.
Motivating the law, they said, were the wishes of the
Peabody Coal Company to mine the rich coal and
uranium reserves that lie beneath the reservation lands.
The relocation frees up land that the company wants to
mine and allows it to make direct bargains with "puppet"
Navajo and Hopi tribal councils without the legal compli
cations caused by joint-use of the land, they said. Ac
cording to the speakers, the tribal councils are recognized
by fewer than 10 percent of the Hopi and Navajo.
Dalton said the majority of the people who are to be
relocated have protested the law and refuse to be moved
from the land on which their people have lived for cen
turies. He said those who have been moved have suffered
physically, spiritually and economically.
"Their Bible is the land," he said.
He added that 50 percent of those relocated have lost
their government-provided houses to fraud schemes of
real estate and loan companies that take advantage of the
peoples' ignorance of the workings of a cash economy.
The law establishes July 7 as the date by which all
relocation is to be completed, Dalton said.
