### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Political Science Prof. John Manley has issued a sec
ond open letter to University President Donald Ken
nedy charging that the president is "overly modest" to
assign prime responsibility for University policies to
others.
"Governance at Stanford is certainly vested in sev
eral constituencies," Manley said in the letter, "hut you
were clearly and directly involved in making and de
fending most of the general policies 1 cite: South Af
rica, nuclear weapons-related research, labor policy,
the Center for Integrated Systems, Hoover and the
Reagan library, and the general issue of openness.
"You are an activist president and, however you as
sess your independent power, it is overly modest to as
sign prime responsibility for such basic policies to
others. On these kind of issues the buck properly stops
at your desk."
Last Monday, Manley released an open letter to
Kennedy asserting that the University administration
"seems more concerned with expansion and national
rankings than human values." He lashed out against
University policies, citing what he called the administ
ration's unwillingness to acknowledge the validity of
critics' arguments and to invite open discussion.
Kennedy responded on Tuesday, saying in an open
letter to Manley that several constituencies — and not
Kennedy — "are responsible for most of the positions
with which you disagree." Kennedy charged that
Manley is frustrated because he has failed to get the
backing of his colleagues in many debates, and said the

professor has " invented an oppressor."
Kennedy, reached at home this weekend, told The
Daily he had nothing more to say regarding Manley's
charges. "I've said what I have to say to John. He's got
all the time in the world. ... I don't."
In his second letter. Manley defended his use of the
president's freshman Orientation address, responding
to Kennedy's accusation that Manley had distorted the
text of the speech. Manley said in the letter that "a
close reading of your speech to the Class of 1989
reveals nothing that changes the meaning of what I
quoted you as saying."
Manley also responded to Kennedy's assertion that
the professor knew his lower-than-average salary raise
was in no way retaliatory for speaking out against al
leged political activities at the Hoover Institution.
Manley said in his letter that he had never claimed
the low raise was retaliatory. "It is true that I raised
retaliation as a possibility, as a question," Manley said.
"But it is also true that 1 base my (salary) appeal to the
provost on a number of grounds, not primarily that
one."
Manley also countered Kennedy's assertion that the
professor had referred to the University's "anti-labor
reputation" without citing any evidence.
"How much evidence is needed that Stanford has an
anti-labor reputation?" Manley wrote. "Hardly a week
goes by without a new outbreak of labor trouble.
"Two days before my letter the USW [United Stan
ford Workers] picketed in protest over the layoff of 10
union workers: the week before, protests were heard
over the layoff of three union members (one with 20
years at Stanford) in Graphics and Printing."
