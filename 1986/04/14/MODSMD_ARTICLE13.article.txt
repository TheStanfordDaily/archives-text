In making a recommendation for the Council of
Presidents in tomorrow's ASSU Elections, the Real
choice appears to be better than no choice — but not
by much.
The comparison between "The Real Solution" slate
and the "Josh" slate is startling in its contrast. As rep
resentatives of the ASSU establishment, "The Real
Solution" is in danger of leading the senate back to
wards the direction of a stale senate that lacks initiative
and creativity. "Josh," on the other hand, appears to
be nothing more than a random, chaotic vote against
the "establishment." In last years ASSU Elections,
The Daily recommended the Hammer and Coffin slate
because it seemed to be a refreshing departure from
the typically bureaucracy clogged confines of past se
nates. But the Josh Slate takes this notion to ridiculous
and potentially damaging extremes.
Given these facts, there appears to be little choice
other than to cast a vote for "The Real Solution." "The
Real Solution," with its carefully balanced slate and a
"let's please everyone" attitude, certainly doesn't ap
pear to give the senate the kind of shakeup it needs,
but it can't be as potentially detrimental as "Josh."
Even though they come off as overly serious and possi
bly insincere, "The Real Solution" does have an abun
dance of experience and does address some vitally im
portant issues for the Stanford community. Student

opinions may differ with some of the stands taken by
" Real," but it is still important that these issues be ad
dressed and considered by a COP slate, and the "Josh"
slate simply does not incorporate them into their plat
form.
What has become manifestly clear in this whole
election is that the students need more choice. Two
extremely opposite candidates and platforms, as is this
year's case, hardly seems to offer any kind of choice
and this problem reflects the problems in the ASSU
Senate. At best, the students' present view of the se
nate is whimsical. It is a body that seems to accomplish
little and talk a lot. It is clear that a change is needed,
and the place to begin is with the ASSU Elections.
If students are concerned about the senate, as well
they should be, this concern should be reflected in
more involvement with the senate and a greater inter
est in its affairs. Hopefully, with a heightened interest
in the senate, we will see more COP platforms running
against each other in the future. As it now stands, we
have been relegated to selecting between two less
than-ideal extremes. If the senate is to be changed into
a more productive, serious and legitimate body, this
must change. If student voters can compare more COP
choices, then they can select, more effectively, the best
choice possible, and that's better for everyone.
For now, however, we urge a vote for "The Real
Solution."
