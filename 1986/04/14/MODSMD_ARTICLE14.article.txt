# ASSU Senate
## 
### 
Virtually all of the 28 senate candidates interviewed
by The Daily expressed dissatisfaction with the current
state of the ASSU. Citing bureaucratic slow-downs and
lack of senate accountability, the candidates identified
problems that have plagued the ASSU for years. The
Daily believes the following 10 candidates have the
energy, the commitment and the ideas to reform the
senate into an active and efficient body responsive to
student needs. In conjunction with a new constitution,
these 10 candidates could revive the ASSU to an or
ganization respected by the student body.
The "People's Platform" was one of several ideas
aimed at focusing the senate's attention on important
issues. While candidates running on that platform will
work on such issues as divestment and a world culture
program, others planned to concentrate on improve
ment of the funding process, expansion of ASSU stu
dent services and communication with the student
body. The Daily's recommendations include a variety
of approaches and a balance among good ideas.
The shortage of women and graduate students
among the candidates is disturbing. Hopefully, next
year's senate will change students' attitude toward the
ASSU in a direction that will encourage a more diverse
group to run in the future.
Leonard Adler/Freshman
Unlike many candidates who are almost exclusively
concerned with grand, sweeping issues facing the
ASSU, Adler would listen to individual students and
pursue the "little things" that make student life easier.
Starting with the premise that "the ASSU is here to
serve students," Adler proposes holding more faculty
student dinners and installing change machines in dor
mitories.
Eric Allen/Sophomore
Allen's prime concern is for working toward a more
efficient and responsive senate, but while pursuing
those lofty goals he also hopes to work on a new Dead
Week policy and a continuation of the ASSU News. A
refreshing combination of calm thoughtfulness and
hard working energy could make Allen the kind of
senator who gets the respect of students and the Uni
versity.
Joel Bellenson/Senior
When Bellenson ran for senate last year. The Daily
said he had the potential to be "the conscience of the
senate." After an admirable first term, he is back, no
less committed to his deep convictions. Bellenson, a
"People's Platform" candidate, is aware of the need for
change in the senate, and his knowledge and commit
ment could help bring it about.
Larry "Bear" Bloch/Junior
"Knowledge" and "experience" come to mind when
considering Bloch, another current senator. He hopes
once again to use the senate's funding procedure as a
means for achieving what students want. A veteran of
the funding process and the senate, Bloch says he
"know how to get things done, but students know what
needs to be done." Bloch inspires confidence that stu
dents' money is being spent wisely.

George "Felix" Cuevas/Junior
By focusing on the funding process, Cuevas hopes to
ensure fair consideration of community service prog
rams, which he says have been traditionally overlooked
by the ASSU. A longtime public service worker him
self, Cuevas reminds us that the Stanford community
includes more than students and faculty. He is en
dorsed by the "People's Platform," yet his focus is very
much on students.
Ben Garcia/Junior
Garcia is endorsed by the "People's Platform," but
his concerns also include the relatively mundane ones
of student housing, financial aid and food service. He
could be an eloquent participant in a full range of is
sues, while bringing humanitarian concern to all. Gar
cia has strong personal concerns, yet he would be a
good representative'.of all students.
Stacey Leyton/Sophomore
Leyton is no armchair student activist. She is a par
ticipant in the causes she espouses, and she would bring
that same enthusiasm and commitment to the ASSU.
She is running on the "People's Platform," but like the
others The Daily endorses she is open to other ideas
and student input. She would be an articulate spokes
person in defense of students' interests and humanita
rian interests of which all students can be proud.
Brett Mahoney/Sophomore
Awareness is the theme in Mahoney's platform —
awareness of other students, minority issues and re
sources available at Stanford. He sees the ASSU as the
means for promoting awareness of the various inter
ests, for making available resources that already exist
here and for exerting the collective voice of students in
the University's affairs. Mahoney knows what he wants
and has the experience and dignity to make people lis
ten.
Lena Slachmuijlder/Freshman
If anything could cure the woes of the senate, it
would be new blood. Slachmuijlder's enthusiasm and
novel ideas provide a refreshing approach to old prob
lems. She wants the ASSU to become an umbrella or
ganization for student groups, and exert influence in
the University and beyond. Through her wide range of
experiences at Stanford and some observation of the
senate at work, she knows student views and what the
senate can do with them.
John van Loben Sels/Junior
Of all the members of the current senate, alternate
van Loben Sels is one of the most dedicated. Now he
wants to follow up on the important issues he began in
his first term. Van Loben Sels has already proven he
can handle the "big issues" — divestment and the
police review board — and this year he hopes to "get
rid of the parliamentary mess" — another big task. Ex
perience and determination could help van Loben Sels
realize his goals.

ganization respected by the student body.
The "People's Platform" was one of several ideas
aimed at focusing the senate's attention on important
issues. While candidates running on that platform will
work on such issues as divestment and a world culture
program, others planned to concentrate on improve
ment of the funding process, expansion of ASSU stu
dent services and communication with the student
body. The Daily's recommendations include a variety
of approaches and a balance among good ideas.
The shortage of women and graduate students
among the candidates is disturbing. Hopefully, next
year's senate will change students' attitude toward the
ASSU in a direction that will encourage a more diverse
group to run in the future.
Leonard Adler/Freshman
Unlike many candidates who are almost exclusively
concerned with grand, sweeping issues facing the
ASSU, Adler would listen to individual students and
pursue the "little things" that make student life easier.
Starting with the premise that "the ASSU is here to
serve students," Adler proposes holding more faculty
student dinners and installing change machines in dor
mitories.
Eric Allen/Sophomore
Allen's prime concern is for working toward a more
efficient and responsive senate, but while pursuing
those lofty goals he also hopes to work on a new Dead
Week policy and a continuation of the ASSU News. A
refreshing combination of calm thoughtfulness and
hard working energy could make Allen the kind of
senator who gets the respect of students and the Uni
versity.
Joel Bellenson/Senior
When Bellenson ran for senate last year. The Daily
said he had the potential to be "the conscience of the
senate." After an admirable first term, he is back, no
less committed to his deep convictions. Bellenson, a
"People's Platform" candidate, is aware of the need for
change in the senate, and his knowledge and commit
ment could help bring it about.
Larry "Bear" Bloch/Junior
"Knowledge" and "experience" come to mind when
considering Bloch, another current senator. He hopes
once again to use the senate's funding procedure as a
means for achieving what students want. A veteran of
the funding process and the senate, Bloch says he
"know how to get things done, but students know what
needs to be done." Bloch inspires confidence that stu
dents' money is being spent wisely.

George "Felix" Cuevas/Junior
By focusing on the funding process, Cuevas hopes to
ensure fair consideration of community service prog
rams, which he says have been traditionally overlooked
by the ASSU. A longtime public service worker him
self, Cuevas reminds us that the Stanford community
includes more than students and faculty. He is en
dorsed by the "People's Platform," yet his focus is very
much on students.
Ben Garcia/Junior
Garcia is endorsed by the "People's Platform," but
his concerns also include the relatively mundane ones
of student housing, financial aid and food service. He
could be an eloquent participant in a full range of is
sues, while bringing humanitarian concern to all. Gar
cia has strong personal concerns, yet he would be a
good representative'.of all students.
Stacey Leyton/Sophomore
Leyton is no armchair student activist. She is a par
ticipant in the causes she espouses, and she would bring
that same enthusiasm and commitment to the ASSU.
She is running on the "People's Platform," but like the
others The Daily endorses she is open to other ideas
and student input. She would be an articulate spokes
person in defense of students' interests and humanita
rian interests of which all students can be proud.
Brett Mahoney/Sophomore
Awareness is the theme in Mahoney's platform —
awareness of other students, minority issues and re
sources available at Stanford. He sees the ASSU as the
means for promoting awareness of the various inter
ests, for making available resources that already exist
here and for exerting the collective voice of students in
the University's affairs. Mahoney knows what he wants
and has the experience and dignity to make people lis
ten.
Lena Slachmuijlder/Freshman
If anything could cure the woes of the senate, it
would be new blood. Slachmuijlder's enthusiasm and
novel ideas provide a refreshing approach to old prob
lems. She wants the ASSU to become an umbrella or
ganization for student groups, and exert influence in
the University and beyond. Through her wide range of
experiences at Stanford and some observation of the
senate at work, she knows student views and what the
senate can do with them.
John van Loben Sels/Junior
Of all the members of the current senate, alternate
van Loben Sels is one of the most dedicated. Now he
wants to follow up on the important issues he began in
his first term. Van Loben Sels has already proven he
can handle the "big issues" — divestment and the
police review board — and this year he hopes to "get
rid of the parliamentary mess" — another big task. Ex
perience and determination could help van Loben Sels
realize his goals.
Virtually all of the 28 senate candidates interviewed
by The Daily expressed dissatisfaction with the current
state of the ASSU. Citing bureaucratic slow-downs and
lack of senate accountability, the candidates identified
problems that have plagued the ASSU for years. The
Daily believes the following 10 candidates have the
energy, the commitment and the ideas to reform the
senate into an active and efficient body responsive to
student needs. In conjunction with a new constitution,
these 10 candidates could revive the ASSU to an or
ganization respected by the student body.
