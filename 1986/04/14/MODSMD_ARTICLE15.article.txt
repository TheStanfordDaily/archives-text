New Constitution
Recommendation: YES
The proposed constitution is a step in the right di
rection. albeit a small one. A decrease in the senate
members and the creation of an administration man
ager are the major changes to centralize governing, but
they are a disappointing compromise considering the
radical reform promised by the current COP. This con
stitution should serve as a starting block for more steps
to cut cumbersome ASSU procedures.
Constitutional Amendment Four
Recommendation: YES
This amendment improves the amending process by
providing for a greater petition percentage require
ment. a senate approval stage and ASSU checking of
Board of Trustees changes.

Constitutional Amendment Five

procedure and eliminates the unitary senate dissolu
tion.
Constitutional Amendment Six
Recommendation: YES
This increases the extent of student control in setting
the amount of the Association Fee. The student con
stituency would have more say in the decision-making

changes in the quality of programs sponsored by the
various organizations.
