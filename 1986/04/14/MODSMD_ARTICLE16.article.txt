Axe Committee
Amount requested: $21,363
Recommendation; YES
The Stanford Axe Committee helps make Big Game
the landmark event that it is. These are the people who
bring you Big Game Week events such as the Bonfire
and the Friday-night Rally in San Francisco. The Axe
Committee also works to promote Stanford spirit the
year round. Most importantly, though, it's Axe Com
mittee vigilance that keeps the Stanford Axe safe on
the Farm where it belongs — and out of the hands of
marauding Cal Weenies. In the interest of preserving
these indeed priceless Stanford traditions, we emphati
cally recommend a Yes vote for the Axe Committee
fee assessment.
Black Student Union
Amount requested: $32,614
Recommendation: YES
The BSU is a dedicated and well-run organization
uniquely geared to meet cultural, educational and
political needs of Stanford's large black community.
Each year the BSU sponsors programs such as soul
food dinner and the Kwanzaa celebration which enrich
not only black students, but also the entire University
community.
Boathouse Party Area
Amount requested: $25,833
Recommendation: NO
The old boathouse on Lake Lag has begun to rot.
The upper deck, formerly the scene of frequent spring
quarter faculty, student and alumni parties has been
declared unsafe for use by large groups. The Boat
house Party Area fee request would initiate construction
of a lighted and landscaped party area behind the
boathouse. There's nothing wrong with a party area
per se. What's wrong is that students are being asked to
pay $25,833 towards a project that, as a "campus im
provement," ought to be financed by the administra
tion. Looking ahead, we also question the wisdom of
building a pricey new party spot behind the boathouse
when the old boathouse itself is slated to be replaced
within a few years anyway. It seems that the boathouse
party area is intended to serve as an interim solution
until the new boathouse is ready. Altogether, $25,833
seems like an awful lot of money for students to have to
pay for a temporary measuie. We recommend a No
vote on the Boathouse Party Area.
Stanford Daily
Amount requested, part 1: $12,114
Recommendation: NEUTRAL
Amount requested, part 2: $27,886
Recommendation: NEUTRAL
The Daily has no choice but to remain formally neut
ral on its own fee request. Nevertheless, we think that
it is only fair to emphasize that The Daily relies sub
stantially on its annual fee assessment. If we lose our
fee money we will have to cut back on coverage — it's
as simple as that. On average, The Daily costs each
student less than two cents per issue. Not a bad deal.
The Daily is probably the most inexpensive newspaper
you will ever buy.
Glee Club
Amount requested: $9,407
Recommendation: NO
The Glee Club wants to go on a singing tour of East
ern Europe this summer — and they want you to help
pay for it. Although $9,407 is not a huge fee request, it
is more than the student body should be expected to
pay for a trip that will directly benefit only 17 students.
Privately, the Glee Club has already raised enough
money to cover all expenses except for airfare. Coming
up with the rest should not be too difficult.
Gradute Student Association
Amount requested: $14,666
Recommendation: YES
Well-managed and energetic, the Graduate Student
Association (GSA) looks out for the needs of Stanford
graduate students. In addition to putting on frequent
social events, the GSA also helps underwrite programs
such as the Espresso Bar and the Holiday House (for
students who have to stay on campus over Christmas).
On this year's election ballot, the GSA is the only fee
assessment exclusively dedicated to meeting the needs
of graduate students. It deserves undergraduate as well
as graduate support. As a GSA spokesman put it, "if
you want your TA's to be happy," vote YES on the
GSA fee assessment.
KZSU
Amount requested, part 1: $54,667
Recommendation: YES
Amount requested, part 2: $9,800
Recommendation: YES
KZSU may have trouble attracting student listeners,
but as Stanford's only campus radio station, it is a valu
able resource worthy of student support. Not only does
KZSU provide its student staff with hands-on broad
casting experience, but it also offers extensive coverage
of Cardinal sports and of campus events such as the re
cent visit by Bishop Desmond Tutu. Part 1 of KZSU's
fee request goes toward basic operating costs. Al
though we feel that KZSU should work harder at de
veloping outside funding sources, we recommend a
YES vote on Part 1.
In addition to basic operating costs, this year KZSU

is also asking for an extra $9,800 (Part 2) to help pay
for what it calls "capital equipment improvements"
such as a reel-to-reel tape deck, a record cleaner and
carpeting for the studio. Stanford students like to com
plain about KZSU's shortcomings. Approving this
one-time fee request might help the station correct
some of them.
The Band
Amount requested, part 1: $34,371
Recommendation: YES
Amount requested, part 2: $7,129
Recommendation: NO
The wild and crazy LSJUMB adds spark and spirit to
the Stanford campus all year round. The nationally
famous Stanford Band brings its unique style of enter
tainment to both athletic events and University func
tions. Part 1 of the Band's fee request is for operating
expenses. Because life without the Band is next to un
thinkable, we enthusiastically recommend approval of
Part 1.
Part 2 of the Band's fee request is harder to swallow.
The Band is requesting $7,129 to help finance a winter
road trip. While this trip would undoubtedly be great
fun for band members and a boost for the basketball
team, it would hardly benefit the rest of the student
body. We recommend a No vote.
All-Campus Party Fund
Amount requested, part 1: $11,091
Recommendation: NO
Amount requested, part 2: $9,145
Recommendation: NO
If approved, the All-Campus Party Fund would pay
for three big, all-campus parties next year, one each
quarter. Part 1 of the fee request would cover operat
ing expenses and costs for the Fall and Spring parties.
Part 2 would pay for a winter party. On a campus like
ours where fraternities, residences and student groups
throw open parties nearly every weekend, a special
fund for all-campus parties seems somewhat redun
dant. Such all-campus parties as Club Ujamaa, Splen
dor on the Grass, the Exotic Erotic Ball, Rincadelts
and the Betanooner have become Stanford traditions.
Sponsoring three more large and expensive all-campus
parties seems hardly necessary. We recommend a No
vote on both parts of the Party Fund's fee request.
Speakers Bureau
Amount requested: $66,059
Recommendation: YES
This student-operated organization continues to do a
superb job of bringing to the Stanford campus promi
nent and challenging speakers from the worlds of liter
ature, politics, journalism and science. Past speakers
have included Carl Sagan, Hunter S. Thompson, Bishop
Desmond Tutu and John Irving. We strongly urge sup
port for this valuable service.
Stanford-in-Government
Amount requested: $24,236
Recommendation: YES
Stanford-in-Government operates a variety of ser
vices which encourage student involvement in govern
ment. In addition to helping students find and apply for
government internships, this non-partisan organization
also sponsors frequent and varied symposia on current
political issues. Stanford-in-Government is well
deserving of student support.
SURE
Amount requested: $12,453
Recommendation: YES
Only a few years old, Stanford United for Rape
Elimination concerns iself with women's safety on
campus. SURE escorts are available to accompany
women traveling alone after dark. We feel that this
service is so indispensible that it ought to be funded by
the University, and not by fee assessment. But until
that happens, we urge students to continue their sup
port of SURE.
Stanford Women's Center
Amount requested: $12,453
Recommendation: YES
This resource center for women at Stanford provides
space for women to meet, health and job information
and crisis support. Programming at the center makes
an effort to reach out to the varied segments of Stan
ford's female population. Programs such as women's
self-defense classes, for example, offer a valuable re
source to all women in the Stanford community.
Events planned for next year include series on the
career/mothering dilemma, women humorists and
women in athletics. The Stanford Women's Center fills
a unique community need. We urge a Yes vote.
Tuesday Films „
Amount requested: $16,390
Recomendation: YES
The Tuesday Films series works to bring rare,
stimulating and unusual films of high artistic value to
the Stanford campus. These movies, offered free of
charge and often co-sponsored by various campus or
ganizations, offer students and faculty a thought
provoking alternative to standard fare Hollywood
cinema.
Note: Only those groups that interviewed with The
Daily were considered for fee assessment endorse
ments.
