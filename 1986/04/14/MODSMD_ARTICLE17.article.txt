## COP slates present their views 
### 
Fun is job one. We say that first because that is most important. Aloha
everyone, we re the Josh Slate and we're running for Council of Presi
dents of the ASSU. Some people, especially our opponents, The Real
Solution, don t think that we're serious about running for COP or that
we 11 be able to do the job, due to our unorthodox style and complete
allegiance to fun. The "Wrong Solution" states that being COP is a big
job and that they will not only run the COP "professionally," but also
get more students involved in the ASSU.
But more students will not want to get involved with the ASSU if it is
turned into a grudging salt mine. True, the ASSU controls money which
it needs to distribute with some amount of rationality. And we will.
Throwing money away is not fun. In the same way that buying too much
beer (or too little beer) for a party is not fun, spending funds on useless
items for the ASSU would not be fun. We will spend funds wisely so as to
get the most fun for all students from each ASSU dollar. And really, the
ASSU is only student government. It shouldn't be so heavy and serious.

JOSH

The way "some solutions talk, you'd think that it was a life or death
matter. Realistically, few people care enough about student government
to get involved as it is. But no one will get involved if it is a boring and
laborious organization caught up in its own seriousness.
We also want to get more students involved in the ASSU. And we
have a realistic plan to do so. We will make the ASSU (yes, you guessed
it) fun. People will want to get involved if we are COP because it will be
a blast. Someone will say, "Ya, I'll head the new ASSU Fake I.D. Ser
vice," or " Ya, I'll come by the COP office and talk about funding for my
student group over a brew with Josh, Al, Jim and Chris!"
Students will not come to the ASSU to talk to committees who have
boards up their backs and gavels in their hands. But they will come and
participate in a fun ASSU, one which realizes that this is college and
college should be fun. They'll come and join in our fun plans. And boy
do we have plans. We want to build a student union in Manzanita Park.
And after the trailers are painted black with white dots and turned into
giant dominoes (and then moved to the Mojave Desert), we'll have a
student-owned union complete with bowling, an outdoor stage and an
over 21 club (oh boy!). We also want to take a lot of pressure off of finals
by changing Wednesday through Friday of Dead Week into no-class
reading days. Who needs classes and homework causing us stress when
we could be studying for finals, or partying down because finals are a
whole week away? We also want to expand, not decrease sports, because
sports make student life fun. We are also for more student groups (and
also more student gropes). Both are fun. Let's have more.
We are serious about being COP. We are serious that the ASSU must
be fun to get students involved. We are serious that Fun Is Job One.
Fun is job one The Josh Slate

Where would you go if you had a problem or concern about life at
Stanford?
We believe that you should be able to go to the Council of Presidents for
worthwhile and professional advice and assistance. The COP should be
committed, experienced and available to anybody who wants their help.
That's why we believe you should vote for The Real Solution. We
have the experience to make the ASSU act on student initiatives and
ideas. Have you ever thought about revising the Dead Week policy or
any other University policy? Have you ever thought about making Tre
sidder more of a student center? Have you ever thought about really
pushing for more graduate housing? Have you ever thought about mak
ing Western Culture a more educational experience? We think you and
others have.
That's why we think running just to have fun doesn't cut it. There are
real concerns that go beyond fun. Is it fun to be harassed by Stanford
police and have nowhere to turn? Is it fun when your heritage is ignored

REAL SOLUTION

in the basic course that all freshmen are required to take? Is it fun when
the University tries to undercut you and the student government can't
help you out?
We certainly don't think so. The Real Solution is committed to a COP
and an ASSU that actually works for and with students. We can directly
address many issues that are important to you. We've been in responsi
ble positions both inside and outside the ASSU — in the ASSU Senate,
on the Program Board, in student groups, on University committees and
in student-run businesses. Coasequently, we know that student groups
want funding, advice and support. Students on University committees
need powerful support and resources because they go into every situa
tion outnumbered and under-experienced. Tresidder is being rebuilt and
students obviously need more control, which we can get for you, because
we have worked on this issue as well as many others. Students are con
cerned about the diversity of the curriculum and the enforcement of
academic policies. Our experience has and will allow us to work with the
University to make changes and implement ideas.
It takes long hours and dedication to run the ASSU efficiently and
fairly. We have demonstrated our commitment to a broad range of
communities and problems at Stanford. Therefore, we know we can be
effective presidents for you ... all of you. Vote yourself a real student
government that is serious about improving life at Stanford.

Fun is job one. We say that first because that is most important. Aloha
everyone, we re the Josh Slate and we're running for Council of Presi
dents of the ASSU. Some people, especially our opponents, The Real
Solution, don t think that we're serious about running for COP or that
we 11 be able to do the job, due to our unorthodox style and complete
allegiance to fun. The "Wrong Solution" states that being COP is a big
job and that they will not only run the COP "professionally," but also
get more students involved in the ASSU.
But more students will not want to get involved with the ASSU if it is
turned into a grudging salt mine. True, the ASSU controls money which
it needs to distribute with some amount of rationality. And we will.
Throwing money away is not fun. In the same way that buying too much
beer (or too little beer) for a party is not fun, spending funds on useless
items for the ASSU would not be fun. We will spend funds wisely so as to
get the most fun for all students from each ASSU dollar. And really, the
ASSU is only student government. It shouldn't be so heavy and serious.

The way "some solutions talk, you'd think that it was a life or death
matter. Realistically, few people care enough about student government
to get involved as it is. But no one will get involved if it is a boring and
laborious organization caught up in its own seriousness.
We also want to get more students involved in the ASSU. And we
have a realistic plan to do so. We will make the ASSU (yes, you guessed
it) fun. People will want to get involved if we are COP because it will be
a blast. Someone will say, "Ya, I'll head the new ASSU Fake I.D. Ser
vice," or " Ya, I'll come by the COP office and talk about funding for my
student group over a brew with Josh, Al, Jim and Chris!"
Students will not come to the ASSU to talk to committees who have
boards up their backs and gavels in their hands. But they will come and
participate in a fun ASSU, one which realizes that this is college and
college should be fun. They'll come and join in our fun plans. And boy
do we have plans. We want to build a student union in Manzanita Park.
And after the trailers are painted black with white dots and turned into
giant dominoes (and then moved to the Mojave Desert), we'll have a
student-owned union complete with bowling, an outdoor stage and an
over 21 club (oh boy!). We also want to take a lot of pressure off of finals
by changing Wednesday through Friday of Dead Week into no-class
reading days. Who needs classes and homework causing us stress when
we could be studying for finals, or partying down because finals are a
whole week away? We also want to expand, not decrease sports, because
sports make student life fun. We are also for more student groups (and
also more student gropes). Both are fun. Let's have more.
We are serious about being COP. We are serious that the ASSU must
be fun to get students involved. We are serious that Fun Is Job One.
Fun is job one The Josh Slate

Where would you go if you had a problem or concern about life at
Stanford?
We believe that you should be able to go to the Council of Presidents for
worthwhile and professional advice and assistance. The COP should be
committed, experienced and available to anybody who wants their help.
That's why we believe you should vote for The Real Solution. We
have the experience to make the ASSU act on student initiatives and
ideas. Have you ever thought about revising the Dead Week policy or
any other University policy? Have you ever thought about making Tre
sidder more of a student center? Have you ever thought about really
pushing for more graduate housing? Have you ever thought about mak
ing Western Culture a more educational experience? We think you and
others have.
That's why we think running just to have fun doesn't cut it. There are
real concerns that go beyond fun. Is it fun to be harassed by Stanford
police and have nowhere to turn? Is it fun when your heritage is ignored

REAL SOLUTION

in the basic course that all freshmen are required to take? Is it fun when
the University tries to undercut you and the student government can't
help you out?
We certainly don't think so. The Real Solution is committed to a COP
and an ASSU that actually works for and with students. We can directly
address many issues that are important to you. We've been in responsi
ble positions both inside and outside the ASSU — in the ASSU Senate,
on the Program Board, in student groups, on University committees and
in student-run businesses. Coasequently, we know that student groups
want funding, advice and support. Students on University committees
need powerful support and resources because they go into every situa
tion outnumbered and under-experienced. Tresidder is being rebuilt and
students obviously need more control, which we can get for you, because
we have worked on this issue as well as many others. Students are con
cerned about the diversity of the curriculum and the enforcement of
academic policies. Our experience has and will allow us to work with the
University to make changes and implement ideas.
It takes long hours and dedication to run the ASSU efficiently and
fairly. We have demonstrated our commitment to a broad range of
communities and problems at Stanford. Therefore, we know we can be
effective presidents for you ... all of you. Vote yourself a real student
government that is serious about improving life at Stanford.
