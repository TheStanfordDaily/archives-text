# Freshman beaten after leaving Rush parties
## 
### KEN FENYO Senior staff writer 
A freshman who suffered two broken
ribs and a collapsed lung in a fight Thurs
day night remained in stable but improving
condition yesterday following what Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons called a
"near-death" iitUviKin.
The freshman, David Curry, was said to
have been kicked by two other students
during the altercation, which occurred
after the three had attended fraternity
Rush parties.
Joe Henri, resident assistant in Curry's
Twain residence, said he and another stu
dent rushed Curry to Cowell Student
Health Center after the freshman com
plained that he could not breathe. Henri
added that Curry's "chest looked swollen."
From Cowell, Curry was moved to Stan
ford Hospital's Intensive Care Unit, Henri
said.
"He was bleeding internally," Lyons
said. His condition "was very critical when
he was taken to the hospital."
According to Diana Conklin, assistant
dean of Student Affairs and director of the
Row, the fight between Curry and
freshmen Bill McKlevy and Randy Von
Feldt occurred on Lasuen Mall, between

the Delta Upsilon and Sigma Chi frater
nities. Lyons said the fight took place at
approximately 3 a.m. Friday.
"He was kicked in addition to whatever
else happened," Conklin said. A member
of the DUs drove Curry home, she added.
The Judicial Affairs Office will begin
discussions with McKlevy and Von Feldt
today, Lyons said. -
Curry, McKlevy and Von Feldt were
"quite drunk" at the time of the alterca
tion, according to Lyons. All three stu
dents had attended Rush parties given by
the DU, Sigma Chi and Beta Theta Pi
fraternities, Lyons said, although he added
that he was not sure if the students had at
tended any other parties that night.
Von Feldt, a Branner resident, refused
to discuss the incident with The Daily.
McKlevy, who lives in Florence Moore,
was unavailable for comment.
Lyons said he has assigned Conklin and
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano to
gather facts concerning the fight. "We're
investigating from several angles," Conklin
said. "I m asking the IFC (Interfraternity
Council) to investigate the DU's role.
Sigma Chi and Beta will be talked to as
well."
If it is discovered that Curry or the other
two students had become intoxicated at

one of the Rush parties, then "clearly [the
implicated fraternity] would not be al
lowed to serve alcohol" at its social func
tions, Lyons said.
"This is just the kind of thing the Uni
versity is concerned about as a result of the
alcoholic Rush activities of the frats," he
said.
Noting that the Cu/ry indent might re
flect poorly on Rush in general, David
Northway, vice president of the IFC, said
the executive council of the IFC would
propose at a meeting on Thursday that al
cohol use might be curtailed for the dura
tion of Rush. The proposals could result in
"maybe even a dry rush," Northway said.
Reports of the incident both before and
after the fight between the freshmen re
main sketchy.
According to the brother of the
freshman, Daniel Curry, David Curry said
he, McKlevy, Von Feldt and two other
freshmen were talking outside of the DU
house about 2:30 a.m. Friday. Around 3
a.m., the fraternity members went into the
house, followed by McKlevy and Von
Feldt, David Curry said.
When David Curry attempted to enter
the house, the two other freshmen "told
Dave that it was 'time for him to go
home,' " Daniel Curry said. After David

demanded to speak to one of the DUs,
McKlevy and Von Feldt started walking
toward him.
"Dave got into a karate stance and pre
tended he knew karate in order to scare
them off," said Daniel Curry, who flew in
from Michigan on Friday. He added that
his brother was not sure if he tried to kick
one of the other two freshmen.
"Dave tried to run away, but they
chased him. He slipped on the grass, got up
and then tripped again in the road. .. . The
guys came up and started kicking him
many times in the back, stomach, hands
and legs," he said. "One of the frat guys
eventually broke it up and took him
home."
Conklin said she had heard "that the
fight started in the DU house after the
party ended."
After a house meeting yesterday called
to "piece together" the events of Friday
morning, Scott Hartman, the DU presi
dent, said the fight definitely did not begin
in the fraternity. While he admitted that
there existed a "fuzziness about where and
when the altercation started," Hartman
said, "My impression is that the fight
started while they were walking from
Sigma Chi to DUs."
