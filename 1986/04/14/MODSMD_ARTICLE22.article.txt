## Card sweeps Bears further into cellar 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
The pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, like
the components of a batting order,
need to be put together just right —
or else.
If they're scattered, or maybe mis
placed, the product isn't quite up to
snuff. But if they're grouped prop
erly, what emerges is sheer beauty.
After watching his team drop four
of its last five games, Mark Marquess,
Stanford's veteran coach-turned jig
saw mastermind, did a little rear
ranging of his team's puzzle before
this weekend's three-game series with
California. And like magic, all the
pieces fell together.
Lineup changes and additions
played a big role in the Cardinal's
sweep of the Golden Bears, which
was culminated by yesterday's 9-4
win at Sunken Diamond. Stanford's
refurbished offense, which had lagged
of late, generated 24 runs on 42 hits
in the three games.
Combined with Friday's 10-4 win
and Saturday's 5-4 victory, Stanford
upped its record in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division to
11-5 and remained in a first-place tie
with UCLA, which took three games
from USC over the weekend.
California, 6-15, fell deeper into the
Six Pac's cellar.
"This year I've had to coach more,
do more things," Marquess said.
"Last year it was easy ... we used the
same lineup eveiy day."
With the likes of seniors Rick
Lundblade, Pete Stanicek and John
Verducci, Marquess' task was a sim
ple one: fill in the lineup card and let
his stars do the rest. With plenty of
holes to patch this year, though. Mar
quess has been busy. Take this
weekend, for example.
• Marquess did the improbable: he
put right fielder Toi Cook, a slashing
hitter who entered the series with a
.267 batting average and one home
run in 155 at-bats, in the cleanup
spot.
And, presto. Cook responded. The
junior notched the game winning RBI
in Berkeley Saturday with a two-run
double off Cal's Mark Sampson (3-4)

in the first inning: and he did it again
yesterday, grounding a one-out single
to center in the bottom of the first to
score Ruben Amaro from third with
Stanford's first run of the ball game.
"Sure, I'd like the No. 4 guy to hit
25 dingers for us," Marquess said,
"but we don't have that. You have to
adjust to your personnel."
For his part. Cook (7-for-12 over
the three games with four RBI) felt at
home in the cleanup spot. "I like hit
ting fourth . . . it's a confidence
thing," Cook said. "By hitting me

there, they're showing confidence in
me and that helps."
Raved Marquess: "He's our best
hitter right now, especially in the
clutch over the last two weeks." Cook
leads the team with 16 RBI in Six-Pac
play.
Marquess also shifted left fielder
Walt Harris, who leads the team with
24 stolen bases, out of the leadoff
spot. "He's swinging the bat better
now that he's farther down in the
order," Marquess said of Harris, who
was 4-for-5 yesterday with two runs

scored, and 8-for-13 in the series.
• Marquess did the daring: he
moved freshman first baseman Ron
Witmeyer into a lineup that already
featured a rookie regular, Frank
Carey, at shortstop, and another
frosh, Ed Sprague, as the on-again,
off-again designated hitter.
Besides knocking in four runs over
the weekend Witmeyer lived up to his
billing as, in Marquess' words, "our
finest glove man at the position (first
base)." The left-hander showed good
range at first and an ability to dig out

the tough short hop.
Carey, for his part, had five base
hits in 11 trips to go with three RBI.
Sprague, who on Saturday replaced
Doug 'What have you done for us
lately?" Robbins (hitless in his last 10
at-bats) as the DH, went 4-for-9 for
the weekend and scored three times.
• Marquess went by the book when
he needed to: he called on southpaw
reliever A 1 Osuna to stifle the predo
minantly left-handed hitting Cal
lineup when trouble brewed.
"We were hoping to bring in A 1

twice this weekend with leads," Mar
quess said, "because we felt he
matched up well against Cal. ... He
did a great job for us."
Osuna, who suffered a loss, his sec
ond of the year, against UCLA a
week ago, rescued starter Kevin
Kunkel (3-3) yesterday, pitching
three frames of relief to help preserve
the win. He also recorded his first
save of the year Saturday by throwing
three scoreless innings in Stanford's
5-4 victory.
• And, even amidst this weekend's
climate of change. Marquess had the
patience to go with what has worked
in the past: he stuck with his ace, Jack
McDowell, in Friday's opener, al
though the right-hander, by his own
admission, "didn't have, for probably
the first time all year, good juice on
the fastball."
McDowell, 9-2, completed his
eighth game of the year, scattering
nine hits, walking one and striking out
seven along the way. He benefitted
from a four-run Stanford rally in the
bottom of the first and a six-run out
burst in the Cardinal seventh.
Card notes
By scoring five times this weekend,
Mark Davis broke former teammate
Pete Stanicek's record for most runs
scored in a career by a Six-Pac player.
Davis has now scored 224 runs in his
Stanford career . . . Davis also ex
tended his hitting streak to 11 games.
Sprague is working on a six-game
streak.
The Cardinal registered 11 of its 24
runs against Cal in the first inning . . .
Plenel (3-1), Saturday's winner, re
tired the first nine batters to face him
before surrendering Chris Mayo's in
field style in the fourth . . . Stanford
once again played without the benefit
of the longball. The Cardinal did not
hit a home run during the three
games. Cal hit three.
The coming week promises to be a
busy one for the Cardinal. The team
plays 2:30 p.m. games here against
San Jose St. tomorrow and UOP
Wednesday. Then Arizona St. comes
to town for a three-game set starting
Friday. UCLA and Stanford will
make up a pair of rain-delayed games
with a double-header next Monday.


California pitcher Doug Hylton may have unsettled Mark Davis a bit,
but it was Stanford that had Cal hopping most of the weekend. The
Cardinal swept a three-game series from the Bears, winning Friday and
yesterday at Sunken Diamond and Saturday at Cal's Evans Diamond.

Davis scored five times over the weekend, giving him 224 tallies for his
career. His second run Friday broke Pete Stanicek's Pacific 10 South
ern Division record for runs scored. Davis and the Cardinal will be kept
busy in the near future, with seven games in the next eight days.

One of the reasons for Stanford's 14-1 record this year has been the steady stream of victories provided by the
bottom half of the Cardinal's singles ladder, including No. 5 player Kay Tittle. Tittle came through again yes
terday against Arizona, beating Karen Buchholz 7-5, 6-4.

11-5 and remained in a first-place tie
with UCLA, which took three games
from USC over the weekend.
California, 6-15, fell deeper into the
Six Pac's cellar.
"This year I've had to coach more,
do more things," Marquess said.
"Last year it was easy ... we used the
same lineup eveiy day."
With the likes of seniors Rick
Lundblade, Pete Stanicek and John
Verducci, Marquess' task was a sim
ple one: fill in the lineup card and let
his stars do the rest. With plenty of
holes to patch this year, though. Mar
quess has been busy. Take this
weekend, for example.
• Marquess did the improbable: he
put right fielder Toi Cook, a slashing
hitter who entered the series with a
.267 batting average and one home
run in 155 at-bats, in the cleanup
spot.
And, presto. Cook responded. The
junior notched the game winning RBI
in Berkeley Saturday with a two-run
double off Cal's Mark Sampson (3-4)

in the first inning: and he did it again
yesterday, grounding a one-out single
to center in the bottom of the first to
score Ruben Amaro from third with
Stanford's first run of the ball game.
"Sure, I'd like the No. 4 guy to hit
25 dingers for us," Marquess said,
"but we don't have that. You have to
adjust to your personnel."
For his part. Cook (7-for-12 over
the three games with four RBI) felt at
home in the cleanup spot. "I like hit
ting fourth . . . it's a confidence
thing," Cook said. "By hitting me

there, they're showing confidence in
me and that helps."
Raved Marquess: "He's our best
hitter right now, especially in the
clutch over the last two weeks." Cook
leads the team with 16 RBI in Six-Pac
play.
Marquess also shifted left fielder
Walt Harris, who leads the team with
24 stolen bases, out of the leadoff
spot. "He's swinging the bat better
now that he's farther down in the
order," Marquess said of Harris, who
was 4-for-5 yesterday with two runs

scored, and 8-for-13 in the series.
• Marquess did the daring: he
moved freshman first baseman Ron
Witmeyer into a lineup that already
featured a rookie regular, Frank
Carey, at shortstop, and another
frosh, Ed Sprague, as the on-again,
off-again designated hitter.
Besides knocking in four runs over
the weekend Witmeyer lived up to his
billing as, in Marquess' words, "our
finest glove man at the position (first
base)." The left-hander showed good
range at first and an ability to dig out

the tough short hop.
Carey, for his part, had five base
hits in 11 trips to go with three RBI.
Sprague, who on Saturday replaced
Doug 'What have you done for us
lately?" Robbins (hitless in his last 10
at-bats) as the DH, went 4-for-9 for
the weekend and scored three times.
• Marquess went by the book when
he needed to: he called on southpaw
reliever A 1 Osuna to stifle the predo
minantly left-handed hitting Cal
lineup when trouble brewed.
"We were hoping to bring in A 1

twice this weekend with leads," Mar
quess said, "because we felt he
matched up well against Cal. ... He
did a great job for us."
Osuna, who suffered a loss, his sec
ond of the year, against UCLA a
week ago, rescued starter Kevin
Kunkel (3-3) yesterday, pitching
three frames of relief to help preserve
the win. He also recorded his first
save of the year Saturday by throwing
three scoreless innings in Stanford's
5-4 victory.
• And, even amidst this weekend's
climate of change. Marquess had the
patience to go with what has worked
in the past: he stuck with his ace, Jack
McDowell, in Friday's opener, al
though the right-hander, by his own
admission, "didn't have, for probably
the first time all year, good juice on
the fastball."
McDowell, 9-2, completed his
eighth game of the year, scattering
nine hits, walking one and striking out
seven along the way. He benefitted
from a four-run Stanford rally in the
bottom of the first and a six-run out
burst in the Cardinal seventh.
Card notes
By scoring five times this weekend,
Mark Davis broke former teammate
Pete Stanicek's record for most runs
scored in a career by a Six-Pac player.
Davis has now scored 224 runs in his
Stanford career . . . Davis also ex
tended his hitting streak to 11 games.
Sprague is working on a six-game
streak.
The Cardinal registered 11 of its 24
runs against Cal in the first inning . . .
Plenel (3-1), Saturday's winner, re
tired the first nine batters to face him
before surrendering Chris Mayo's in
field style in the fourth . . . Stanford
once again played without the benefit
of the longball. The Cardinal did not
hit a home run during the three
games. Cal hit three.
The coming week promises to be a
busy one for the Cardinal. The team
plays 2:30 p.m. games here against
San Jose St. tomorrow and UOP
Wednesday. Then Arizona St. comes
to town for a three-game set starting
Friday. UCLA and Stanford will
make up a pair of rain-delayed games
with a double-header next Monday.


California pitcher Doug Hylton may have unsettled Mark Davis a bit,
but it was Stanford that had Cal hopping most of the weekend. The
Cardinal swept a three-game series from the Bears, winning Friday and
yesterday at Sunken Diamond and Saturday at Cal's Evans Diamond.

Davis scored five times over the weekend, giving him 224 tallies for his
career. His second run Friday broke Pete Stanicek's Pacific 10 South
ern Division record for runs scored. Davis and the Cardinal will be kept
busy in the near future, with seven games in the next eight days.

One of the reasons for Stanford's 14-1 record this year has been the steady stream of victories provided by the
bottom half of the Cardinal's singles ladder, including No. 5 player Kay Tittle. Tittle came through again yes
terday against Arizona, beating Karen Buchholz 7-5, 6-4.
The pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, like
the components of a batting order,
need to be put together just right —
or else.
If they're scattered, or maybe mis
placed, the product isn't quite up to
snuff. But if they're grouped prop
erly, what emerges is sheer beauty.
After watching his team drop four
of its last five games, Mark Marquess,
Stanford's veteran coach-turned jig
saw mastermind, did a little rear
ranging of his team's puzzle before
this weekend's three-game series with
California. And like magic, all the
pieces fell together.
Lineup changes and additions
played a big role in the Cardinal's
sweep of the Golden Bears, which
was culminated by yesterday's 9-4
win at Sunken Diamond. Stanford's
refurbished offense, which had lagged
of late, generated 24 runs on 42 hits
in the three games.
Combined with Friday's 10-4 win
and Saturday's 5-4 victory, Stanford
upped its record in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division to
11-5 and remained in a first-place tie
