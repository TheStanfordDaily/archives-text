# Netters blast Cats, Devils
## Hatless Letts leads Stanford to victories 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Cardinal senior John Letts forgot
to wear his trademark hat this past
weekend, but he and his teammates
didn't forget how to accomplish the
task set before them.
"Workmanlike" was the word
Stanford Coach Dick Gould used to
describe the Cardinal's victories
over Arizona and Arizona State in
the sun and wind of the Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
On Friday the Cardinal breezed
through Arizona's singles lineup
and then fought hard to take all
three doubles matches and give
Stanford an unspectacular but
well-earned 9-0 shutout.
And in Saturday's match against
the Sun Devils, the Cardinal squad

overcame the absence of Jim Grabb
on the playing courts to snuff out
the Sun Devils 6-1.
The victories raised Stanford's
record to 12-3 overall and 6-1 in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Arizona
fell to 16-15 overall and 0-9 in the
conference. ASU is now 14-12,
1-7.
The windy weekend was marked
by the return to form of Letts. The
senior from Rolling Hills won both
his singles matches and teamed with
sophomore Patrick McEnroe to win
two doubles matches. And not once
all weekend did he don a cap.
"Actually, I just forgot it," Letts
said. "I can't remember the last
time I didn't wear one. I'll go back
to my hat, but if I lose with it I
might have to try a new look."

Gould, however, didn't pay much
attention to the headdress factor.
He just looked at Letts' perfor
mance.
"I was really pleased," he said.
"John had a tough match today
(Saturday) and he raised his game
for it. That gives the whole team a
boost."
The whole Cardinal team started
out like gangbusters Friday against
Arizona, and McEnroe led the
charge. The undefeated sophomore
clocked Wildcat lan Aler by a 6-1,
6-1 score. Letts finished his match
just minutes later, defeating Rob
Horwood 6-1, 6-0.
Stanford's No. 2 and No. 1
players, Grabb and Dan Goldie,
continued the sweep by trouncing
Jose Wasserfrier 6-1, 6-2 and Benji
Papell 6-2, 6-3, respectively. Car
dinal senior Eric Rosenfeld finally
clinched the match by defeating
Wildcat John Schmitt 6-3, 6-4, and
junior Scott Moody finished the
singles sweep by edging Jose Rojas
7-5, 6-4 at No. 6.
The Wildcats then regrouped and
gave the Cardinal a harder time in
the doubles play. With Goldie and
Grabb taking a rest, McEnroe and
Letts moved up to play No. 1 dou
bles. The Stanford duo rebounded
from losing the first set to the
Arizona team of Schmitt and Aler
to take the match 2-6, 6-4, 6-4.
The Cardinal pair of Rosenfeld
and Moody also bounced back from
a first set loss to defeat Papell and
Wasserfrier 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. In the
third doubles, Stanford juniors
Mark Jacobson and Geordie
McKee defeated Horwood and
Rojas 7-5, 6-4.
On Saturday, with Grabb sitting
out due to an aggravated muscle
pull, everyone except Goldie had to
move up a notch and face a tougher
Sun Devil. No problem.
Goldie. McEnroe and Rosenfeld
won their matches in straight sets,
while Letts and Moody both came
back strong in the third sets to de
feat their opponents and clinch
Stanford's 12th victory. In the sixth
singles match, Jacobson came up
just short against Jeff Karp. 7-6.
6-7, 7-5.
In doubles play. McEnroe and
Letts glided to victory over ASU's
Ken Kuperstein and Jeff Wood 6-3.
6-2. The other two doubles matches
were suspended due to darkness
with the score tied at one set apiece
in both.
Stanford ends its long homestand
streak tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
when it hosts 19th-ranked UC-
Irvine.
