### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
With a USC rematch less than a week away, the top
ranked but physically ailing Stanford women's tennis team
looked anything hut weak yesterday, dominating visiting
Arizona 8-1 and raising its record to 14-1.
Earlier in the season, the Wildcats almost upset the
Cardinal in Tucson. But yesterday's match was thoroughly
controlled by the nation's No. 1 team. The final score
might well have been 9-0 had Stanford not defaulted the
final doubles match.
Arizona, having catapaulted into the nation's elite by
knocking off heralded UCLA last week, started strongly
yesterday. In the No. 2 singles, the Wildcats' Sue Russo
took the first set from Cardinal freshman Marianne Wer
del. 6-3. Russo's teammate Jackie Ranger won the first set
of the No. 4 singles against junior Stephanie Savides, 7-5.
"Those shaky starts scare me." Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. Brennan was not scared for long, however.
Stanford sophomore Can Hagey won a key tie-breaker in
the first set of the No. 6 singles, and the Cardinal caught
fire.

Hagey continued her mastery of Arizona's JoJo Grum
mel. winning the second set 6-3 to give Stanford a I -0 lead
in the match.
Though playing with the stomach flu. Werdel refused to
quit against Russo. Trailing 5-4 in the second set and
down 0-2 on her serve. Werdel came back to take the set
7-5. She then disposed of Russo 6-2 in the third set to put
the Cardinal up 2-0.
"Marianne is really a tough competitor." Brennan said.
"She's one of the toughest I've ever encountered. She can
be dying and she'll continue to play."
Werdel continued to play yesterday despite getting sick
before and during the match. "I got sick right before the
match and in the middle of the match," she said. "I just
wanted to get it over."
She indicated that she prides herself on the ability to
come from behind. "That's my strength." Werdel said. "I
play well when I'm behind."
"She's at her best under pressure." Brennan added.
Savides rounded out the Cardinal sweep of the first
round of singles matches, taking the second and third sets
