# Singles perfection keys 8-1 win over Arizona
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
With a USC rematch less than a week away, the top
ranked but physically ailing Stanford women's tennis team
looked anything hut weak yesterday, dominating visiting
Arizona 8-1 and raising its record to 14-1.
Earlier in the season, the Wildcats almost upset the
Cardinal in Tucson. But yesterday's match was thoroughly
controlled by the nation's No. 1 team. The final score
might well have been 9-0 had Stanford not defaulted the
final doubles match.
Arizona, having catapaulted into the nation's elite by
knocking off heralded UCLA last week, started strongly
yesterday. In the No. 2 singles, the Wildcats' Sue Russo
took the first set from Cardinal freshman Marianne Wer
del. 6-3. Russo's teammate Jackie Ranger won the first set
of the No. 4 singles against junior Stephanie Savides, 7-5.
"Those shaky starts scare me." Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. Brennan was not scared for long, however.
Stanford sophomore Can Hagey won a key tie-breaker in
the first set of the No. 6 singles, and the Cardinal caught
fire.

Hagey continued her mastery of Arizona's JoJo Grum
mel. winning the second set 6-3 to give Stanford a I -0 lead
in the match.
Though playing with the stomach flu. Werdel refused to
quit against Russo. Trailing 5-4 in the second set and
down 0-2 on her serve. Werdel came back to take the set
7-5. She then disposed of Russo 6-2 in the third set to put
the Cardinal up 2-0.
"Marianne is really a tough competitor." Brennan said.
"She's one of the toughest I've ever encountered. She can
be dying and she'll continue to play."
Werdel continued to play yesterday despite getting sick
before and during the match. "I got sick right before the
match and in the middle of the match," she said. "I just
wanted to get it over."
She indicated that she prides herself on the ability to
come from behind. "That's my strength." Werdel said. "I
play well when I'm behind."
"She's at her best under pressure." Brennan added.
Savides rounded out the Cardinal sweep of the first
round of singles matches, taking the second and third sets
from Ranger by scores of 6-2 and 6-4.
The second round of singles began with a bang as Car
dinal junior Patty Fendick thumped Arizona's Jill Smoller
in the No. I singles, 6-3, 6-1. Fendick had lost to Smoller
in their earlier confrontation in Tucson.
"I thought Patty played a pretty good match," Brennan
said. "She's using a new racket which is giving her a
psychological edge.
"People ask me about how she's doing, and I say she's
playing better than ever," he added. "The new racket
gave her the edge she's needed."
Stanford's Kay Tittle continued to win quietly at the
No. 5 singles position. Despite playing with a sore wrist
and ailing knee yesterday, she defeated the Wildcats'
Karen Buchholz in straight sets, 7-5, 6-4.
"We're a good team, and we have good depth," Bren
nan said of the ability of Tittle and Hagey to win with reg
ularity at the No. 5 and No. 6 singles positions. "We al
ways win against an Arizona down at four, five and six."
Tittle's victory clinched the match, but Stanford was not
through beating up on the Wildcats. Junior Leigh Anne
Eldredge continued the onslaught, sweeping Arizona's
Chris Sieffret in the No. 3 singles match, 7-5, 6-0.
The Wildcats' only victory of the day came off the court,
as Brennan decided not to field a No. 3 doubles team.
The doubles matches that were played both went the
Cardinal's way, though they were decided in quite differ
ing manners.

Hagey and Savides quickly handled Sieffret and Buch
holz in the No. 2 doubles by a 6-3, 6-2 score. The final
point of the match epitomized the Wildcats' day-long
frustration as Sieffret completely missed an overhead
standing two feet from the net.
Unlike the other doubles match, the No. I doubles
match was a battle throughout. Stanford's team of Fen
dick and Eldredge dropped the first set but rebounded for
a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 victory over Smoller and Russo.
"That was a good win for Fendick and Eldredge,"'
Brennan said. "Smoller and Russo are one of the best
teams in the nation. As a matter of fact, Russo is probably
the best doubles player in the nation."
As convincing as Stanford's play has been the past
week, the team will probably drop to No. 2 in this week's
rankings because of its April 4 loss at USC. A victory over
the Trojans next weekend, however, would lift the team to
the nation's top spot once again, and the Cardinal is ea
gerly eyeing the upcoming match.
"I really think we're a little better than they are," Bren
nan said.
In USC's earlier victory, Cardinal freshman Eleni Ros
sides did not play because of shin splints in both legs. Ros
sides, who has not played since early March, is still ques
tionable for next weekend's match.
Rossides has requested the use of a golf cart so that she
can rest her leg this week. "She tells me if she can get a
golf cart, she can play (against USC)," Brennan said.
"But I think that's a play," he joked. "Next it'll be a
Mercedes and I can play Thursday."

frustration as Sieffret completely missed an overhead
standing two feet from the net.
Unlike the other doubles match, the No. I doubles
match was a battle throughout. Stanford's team of Fen
dick and Eldredge dropped the first set but rebounded for
a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 victory over Smoller and Russo.
"That was a good win for Fendick and Eldredge,"'
Brennan said. "Smoller and Russo are one of the best
teams in the nation. As a matter of fact, Russo is probably
the best doubles player in the nation."
As convincing as Stanford's play has been the past
week, the team will probably drop to No. 2 in this week's
rankings because of its April 4 loss at USC. A victory over
the Trojans next weekend, however, would lift the team to
the nation's top spot once again, and the Cardinal is ea
gerly eyeing the upcoming match.
"I really think we're a little better than they are," Bren
nan said.
In USC's earlier victory, Cardinal freshman Eleni Ros
sides did not play because of shin splints in both legs. Ros
sides, who has not played since early March, is still ques
tionable for next weekend's match.
Rossides has requested the use of a golf cart so that she
can rest her leg this week. "She tells me if she can get a
golf cart, she can play (against USC)," Brennan said.
"But I think that's a play," he joked. "Next it'll be a
Mercedes and I can play Thursday."
With a USC rematch less than a week away, the top
ranked but physically ailing Stanford women's tennis team
looked anything hut weak yesterday, dominating visiting
Arizona 8-1 and raising its record to 14-1.
Earlier in the season, the Wildcats almost upset the
Cardinal in Tucson. But yesterday's match was thoroughly
controlled by the nation's No. 1 team. The final score
might well have been 9-0 had Stanford not defaulted the
final doubles match.
Arizona, having catapaulted into the nation's elite by
knocking off heralded UCLA last week, started strongly
yesterday. In the No. 2 singles, the Wildcats' Sue Russo
took the first set from Cardinal freshman Marianne Wer
del. 6-3. Russo's teammate Jackie Ranger won the first set
of the No. 4 singles against junior Stephanie Savides, 7-5.
"Those shaky starts scare me." Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. Brennan was not scared for long, however.
Stanford sophomore Can Hagey won a key tie-breaker in
the first set of the No. 6 singles, and the Cardinal caught
fire.

Hagey continued her mastery of Arizona's JoJo Grum
mel. winning the second set 6-3 to give Stanford a I -0 lead
in the match.
Though playing with the stomach flu. Werdel refused to
quit against Russo. Trailing 5-4 in the second set and
down 0-2 on her serve. Werdel came back to take the set
7-5. She then disposed of Russo 6-2 in the third set to put
the Cardinal up 2-0.
"Marianne is really a tough competitor." Brennan said.
"She's one of the toughest I've ever encountered. She can
be dying and she'll continue to play."
Werdel continued to play yesterday despite getting sick
before and during the match. "I got sick right before the
match and in the middle of the match," she said. "I just
wanted to get it over."
She indicated that she prides herself on the ability to
come from behind. "That's my strength." Werdel said. "I
play well when I'm behind."
"She's at her best under pressure." Brennan added.
Savides rounded out the Cardinal sweep of the first
round of singles matches, taking the second and third sets
from Ranger by scores of 6-2 and 6-4.
The second round of singles began with a bang as Car
dinal junior Patty Fendick thumped Arizona's Jill Smoller
in the No. I singles, 6-3, 6-1. Fendick had lost to Smoller
in their earlier confrontation in Tucson.
"I thought Patty played a pretty good match," Brennan
said. "She's using a new racket which is giving her a
psychological edge.
"People ask me about how she's doing, and I say she's
playing better than ever," he added. "The new racket
gave her the edge she's needed."
Stanford's Kay Tittle continued to win quietly at the
No. 5 singles position. Despite playing with a sore wrist
and ailing knee yesterday, she defeated the Wildcats'
Karen Buchholz in straight sets, 7-5, 6-4.
"We're a good team, and we have good depth," Bren
nan said of the ability of Tittle and Hagey to win with reg
ularity at the No. 5 and No. 6 singles positions. "We al
ways win against an Arizona down at four, five and six."
Tittle's victory clinched the match, but Stanford was not
through beating up on the Wildcats. Junior Leigh Anne
Eldredge continued the onslaught, sweeping Arizona's
Chris Sieffret in the No. 3 singles match, 7-5, 6-0.
The Wildcats' only victory of the day came off the court,
as Brennan decided not to field a No. 3 doubles team.
The doubles matches that were played both went the
Cardinal's way, though they were decided in quite differ
ing manners.

Hagey and Savides quickly handled Sieffret and Buch
