# Stanford track falls in home finale
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
One of the funny things about track
meets is that you can't win them
without sprinters.
At Saturday's four-way dual meet
at Stanford Stadium, the Cardinal
track squad was unable to score
points in any race shorter than 800
meters, and although the distance
runners and throwers made a valiant
effort, it wasn't enough. Both the
Stanford men and women lost all
three of their dual meets.
The men's scores were San Diego
State 88, Stanford 57; Fresno State
83, Stanford 62; and Washington 76,
Stanford 60.
The women lost by a 91-69 count
to San Diego State, by 97-64 to
Fresno State and by 87-70 to
Washington.
It was the Cardinal's last home
meet of the season, as well as the final
Stanford appearance for the team's
seniors. And though it would have
been nicer to end their home careers
with a team victory, the Cardinal
seniors still managed to leave in style.
In the first race of the day, the
men's 3,000-meter steeplechase,
senior Ryan Stoll got Stanford off to a
good start with a big win. Stoll pa
tiently waited on the shoulder of
Fresno State's John King until two
laps remained. He then took off from
the tiring field and pushed his way
through to the finish line, winning
easily by 30 yards.
Next, it was senior Ceci Hopp's
turn. Running in the 3,000 meters,
Hopp showed why she was NCAA
champion at this distance. Quickly
leaving the field behind, Hopp
finished 16 seconds ahead of her
closest competitor, Stanford
freshman Kim Stevens, and over 26
seconds ahead of Dianne Fairman of
Fresno State, who placed third.
"It was my last home meet, so I was

especially up," Hopp said.
Hopp then finished her day by
placing third in the 800 meter and
running the anchor leg of the 1,600
meter relay.
With a blazing finish, senior Jeff
Atkinson garnered a win in the 1,500
meter. Through the first 1,200 met
ers, Atkinson was virtually even with
Washington's Bruce Stirling and Paul
Greer of San Diego State.
But when it came time for the kick,
with 300 meters to go, suddenly it was
all Atkinson.

At the 200-meter mark, Atkinson
was in a full sprint, and there was no
question who was going to win. His
kick propelled him to a three-second
win, with Stirling second and Greer
third.
In the women's weight events,
seniors Pam Dukes and Karen Nic
kerson, along with freshman Patty
Purpur showed why Stanford's weight
crew is ranked among the best in the
country.
Dukes won the shotput with a toss
of 54 feet, 4-1/4 inches, and Purpur

placed third with a throw of 49-10.
Nickerson was second in the discus
with a throw of 174-6, followed by
Purpur at 167-7 and Dukes at 164-0.
The winner of the event was San
Diego State's Laura Desnoo, a 1984
U.S. Olympian, whose toss of 184-8
was the nation's best this year.
Other senior winners for Stanford
were Pam Board in the 400 meter
hurdles and Alison Wiley, last year's
NCAA runner-up at 5,000 meters,
who easily outdistanced the 1,500
meter field.
