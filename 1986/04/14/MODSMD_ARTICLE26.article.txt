# Card golfers face tough test at Lady Sun Devil
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
With an NCAA tournament bid
within its grasp, the Stanford wo
men's golf team should get an idea
of how it will fare in postseason
play in the 54-hole Lady Sun Devil,
which commences today at the
Anasazi Golf Course in Phoenix.
The tournament, the Cardinal's
last before the Pac-West Confer
ence Championships April 25-27,
features eight of the nation's top 10
teams: top-ranked Tulsa, Florida,
San Jose State, tourney host
Arizona State, USC, Stanford,
Oklahoma State and UCLA.
"The field here is equal to our
tournament (the Stanford Women's
Intercollegiate) in the fall," Stan
ford Coach Tim Baldwin said.
"(The Lady Mustang in Dallas, the
Stanford tournament and the Lady

Sun Devil) are the three strongest
tournaments of the year and a good
preview of the NCAA champion
ships."'
The Lady Sun Devil also boasts
what Baldwin judged to be seven of
the nations top individuals. Lead
ing the way are defending NCAA
champion Danielle Ammaccapane
of ASU, and U.S. International's
two-time All American Laurette
Mauritz, who won the California
Intercollegiate here in the Bay
Area last week.
They will be challenged by
Florida's Karen Davies, Tulsa's
Adele Lukken, Tulsa's Melissa
McNamara, OSU's Robin Hood
and UCLA's Kay Cockerill.
The Cardinal is still missing Clare
Dolan due to tendinitis of the
wrist, but still fields a strong team
with Julie Carmichael, who was
fifth in the California Intercol

legiate, Kay Cornelius, Kathy
Kostas, Kathleen McCarthy and
Adrienne Gilmartin.
"I'm looking forward to a real
strong performance from our team
and everybody on it," Baldwin said.
Stanford, ranked seventh in the
last official ratings, figures to grab
one of the 14 spots in the NCAA's
May 28-31 in Columbus. In fact,
Baldwin predicts six Far West
teams will be traveling east: USIU,
USC, UCLA, ASU, SJSU and the
Cardinal.
Rankings are decided completely
mathematically, as the squads' 15
best rounds are evaluated with re
spect to the course rating they were
achieved on, making the rankings
completely objective.
So today through Wednesday,
Stanford should get a more subjec
tive idea of where it stands among
the cream of the golf crop.
