# Spikers win in 3 after 22-20 game
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Spurred on by a rowdy crowd
and a remarkable 22-20 first-game
victory, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team scored its biggest win
of the season, sweeping UC-Santa
Barbara 22-20, 15- 12, 15-5
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion.
The victory raised the Cardinal's
California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association (CIVA) record
to 11-7. The Gauchos dropped to
8-9.
A UCSB victory would have
deadlocked the two teams in their
battle for the final West Regional
playoff spot. Now Stanford needs
only to beat St. Mary's Wednesday
night at Maples to clinch the
playoff spot.
Just when the situation called
for a paramount effort, the Cardi
nal came up with clutch perfor
mances from everyone. "Everyone
on our team had a good all-around
game," sophomore Scott Fortune
said. "We played well as a team
which is really important."
As he has done all season,
senior Chris Braun led the Cardi
nal in hitting with 27 kills for a
.389 hitting percentage. Senior
Jon Root followed with 24 kills for
a .442 percentage, and Fortune
added 13 kills for a spectacular
.556 percentage.
Stanford needed a top-notch
effort and more to survive a hectic,
hour-long first game. The Cardinal
came out emotionally soaring at

the start of the match but quickly
fell behind.
"Everyone was totally pumped
up," Fortune said. "We were too
tight. We gave them that big lead."
Stanford regrouped, however,
and tHe game seesawed back and
forth between the two teams. At
21-20, the Cardinal finally ended
the marathon, winning its serve to
capture the game, 22-20.
"Both teams had a chance,"
Fortune said. "We finally pulled it
out."
The momentum generated by
the first-game victory carried
Stanford to a 6-0 lead at the outset
of the second game. As the Cardi
nal had done in the first game,
though, the Gauchos rallied to
take the lead and appeared to be
ready to even the match.
At this point, Stanford's offense
gathered itself and was simply too
much for UCSB. The Cardinal
roared past the Gauchos to take
the second game 15-12.
A demoralized UCSB team was
no match for the inspired Cardinal
in the third game. Stanford
crushed the Gauchos and their
playoff hopes with a 15-5 victory.
"We had control in the third
game," Fortune said. "They
couldn't stop our offense."
If the Cardinal can't beat St.
Mary's Wednesday night, it prob
ably wouldn't deserve to move on
to post-season play. The hapless
Gaels have recorded just one
CIV A victory.
