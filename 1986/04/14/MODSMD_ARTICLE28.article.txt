Despite playing what Cardinal
Coach Cathy Lincoln called "a total
team effort," the Stanford women's
softball team came up short, falling to
visiting Arizona State 5-0 in both
games of Saturday's doubleheader.
Both games remained tight until
the latter stages when the Sun Devils,
ranked third in the nation, found their
offensive groove and collected on
some timely hitting.
"We were never really out of the
games until the final innings â€” always
close," Lincoln said. "We made them

beat us. We did not beat ourselves."
Junior shortstop Laura Buchanan
voiced similar feelings, "No stupid
mental mistakes," she said. "The
mistakes were physical, not mental."
Ultimately, the heavy hitters of the
Sun Devil squad finally measured the
Cardinal starting pitchers Lisa
Buchanan and Betsy Watson, who
both pitched "as well as can be ex
pected of them," according to Lin
coln.
"Arizona State has some good
athletes. When it comes to the late
innings, they are going to hit the
ball," said Lincoln
Though the Stanford offense did

not produce any runs, it was far from
being completely stifled, consistently
getting lead-off hitters on base.
But as has been the case for most of
the season, the Cardinal could not
find the key hit, most notably in the
second game, when it stranded run
ners at second and third in the fourth
inning.
Overall, Lincoln was extremely
pleased with the team's performance
against the Sun Devils, claiming that
it was Stanford's best effort this sea
son.
"The kids kept fighting back," Lin
coln said. "The unity and attitude was
just tremendous."
