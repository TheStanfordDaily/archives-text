# COP slates offer differing solutions

Do you want community educa
tion programs, or do you want a
Stanford Adult Bookstore with no
one under 21 admitted?
Do you want stronger support
for existing theme houses, or do

News Analysis

you want to establish an fcskimo
theme house that melts every
spring?
Do you want to transform the
Western Culture program into a
world culture program, or do you
want to open a Stanford-in-
Atherton campus?
And do you want to improve
student services, or do you want to
staff the Stanford Post Office with
midgets who can't see over the
counter?

These are some of the choices
students will face ;is they decide
which Council of Presidents slate
to support in Stanford's annual
student government elections to
morrow and Wednesday.
The COP race pits a slate that
takes itself and student govern
ment seriously against a slate that
takes almost nothing seriously.
The election will show whether
students here view the ASSU as an
essential organization or a useless
bureaucracy. It will show whether
students want responsible, hard
working leaders or irreverent,
self-proclaimed clowns.
Josh Weinstein, point man of
the ever-jovial ' Josh'" slate, thinks
the students want clowns.
"People seem receptive to the
things we're saying," Weinstein
said. "The bottom line is fun. The
ASSU is a boring, political organiza
tion. ... We want to do things that
people have never done before. We
have the chance to do amazing things.
We want to hold picnics in the linear
accelerator — 'Don't turn it on, Ed!
We're still eating.
Weinstein claims that he has no
serious proposals. He just wants to
have fun.
But the slate includes three mem
bers — Jim Suhre, Alex Danel and
Chris Adamson — who do have some
serious things to say, despite Wein
stein's attempts to keep them laugh
ing.
"We're not all jokes," said Suhre in
Wednesday night's debate, explaining
that the slate's members had brought
the Chaparral out of the red. "We
know how to run a business."
Adamson said the slate plans to
fight a recent Athletic Department
decision to cut funding for five varsity
sports.
Danel laid out plans for a new stu
dent center to be built by 1988 in
Manzanita Park, and emphasized that
he will improve the Concert Network.
"The Real Solution," the slate of
ASSU insiders who think student
government is not a joking matter,
say the "Josh" proposals are at best,
unworkable, and at worst, insulting.
"By making everything into a joke,
you belittle some important issues,"
said slate member Kim Crawford.
"The Real Solution" — with
Crawford, Rudy Fuentes, Mary
Thurber and Carey White — is run
ning largely on a platform of minority
issues: the value of theme houses,
awareness of racism, ethnocentricity
in the Western Culture program. The
slate members say their opponents

are guilty of "subtle racism" by play
ing these campus issues off as jokes.
"There are important issues out
there," said Fuentes. "We're not
joking around, because someone has
to take them seriously."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons argues that there is a place for
humor in student government, but
not for insensitivity.
"I want to take student govern
ment very seriously, because it has
serious roles to play in this Univer
sity," Lyons said. "If student gov
ernment should ever become the
vehicle for nothing but humor ... it
becomes self-serving."
Lyons is frank in his appraisal of
the humor displayed by this years
student government, particularly a
"white supremacist" announcement
and " ASSU Blues," a recent edition
of "ASSU News," both published in
The Daily.
"The white supremacist ad was
meant to be humor," he said. "1
didn't find it funny. It led me to won
der whether they in fact harbor some
right-wing views."
Lyons called the ethnic humor in
the ASSU newsletter "tasteless gar
bage."
"If they thought that was humor,
they missed the mark by a wide
country mile," Lyons said.
Weinstein, editor of the newsletter,
showed a serious side when he
apologized for the "grievous mis
take" in a letter to The Daily.
Asked whether he is worried that
people perceive the "Josh" slate as
racist because it does not appear to
take minority issues seriously.
Weinstein said, "I don't care what
people say, because I know I'm not
racist or bigoted. It's a political ac
cusation."
Weinstein argues that "The Real
Solution" takes itself a little too seri
ously, and the slate's members smile
at the accusation.

"We do take ourselves a little too
seriously," said White, "but when you
get down to it, you find that we're
easygoing and really good with
people."
White says it is "a healthy thing" to
have the "Josh" slate, composed of
four Chaparral staff members, in the
election, and he adds that the current
COP, also Chaparral staffers, have
done a good job this year.
But White feels that the student
government will need experienced
leaders next year, and he says that
only his slate can provide that experi
ence.
"It helps to have at least one or two
people on the slate know the details,
know how things function," White
said, noting that several experienced
ASSU senators will be leaving this
year.
Current COP members Mike Col
lins and Leslie Leland argue that
ASSU experience is not an important
prerequisite to the COP job.
"Any bozo can be president," said
Leland, noting that responsiveness to
students is the most important quality
for ASSU leaders to possess.
Collins said it is irrelevant that
"The Real Solution" has more ex
perience in the ASSU. 'Goodness
knows that Carey is more qualified.
He lives, eats and breathes docu
ments. . . . But there's a great advan
tage to being an outsider. The job
we've done shows that being an in
sider isn't necessary."
Ed Renwick, the senate's deputy
chair, argues that ASSU experience is
an important prerequisite to "under
standing the realities of the (COP)
office."
But he notes that this year's COP
members are well-liked and have
been successful. "They've sort of
ushered in a change," he said. "It's
easy to take yourself too seriously
here."

"Any bozo can be president," said
Leland, noting that responsiveness to
students is the most important quality
for ASSU leaders to possess.
Collins said it is irrelevant that
"The Real Solution" has more ex
perience in the ASSU. 'Goodness
knows that Carey is more qualified.
He lives, eats and breathes docu
ments. . . . But there's a great advan
tage to being an outsider. The job
we've done shows that being an in
sider isn't necessary."
Ed Renwick, the senate's deputy
chair, argues that ASSU experience is
an important prerequisite to "under
standing the realities of the (COP)
office."
But he notes that this year's COP
members are well-liked and have
been successful. "They've sort of
ushered in a change," he said. "It's
easy to take yourself too seriously
here."

These are some of the choices
students will face ;is they decide
which Council of Presidents slate
to support in Stanford's annual
student government elections to
morrow and Wednesday.
The COP race pits a slate that
takes itself and student govern
ment seriously against a slate that
takes almost nothing seriously.
The election will show whether
students here view the ASSU as an
essential organization or a useless
bureaucracy. It will show whether
students want responsible, hard
working leaders or irreverent,
self-proclaimed clowns.
Josh Weinstein, point man of
the ever-jovial ' Josh'" slate, thinks
the students want clowns.
"People seem receptive to the
things we're saying," Weinstein
said. "The bottom line is fun. The
ASSU is a boring, political organiza
tion. ... We want to do things that
people have never done before. We
have the chance to do amazing things.
We want to hold picnics in the linear
accelerator — 'Don't turn it on, Ed!
We're still eating.
Weinstein claims that he has no
serious proposals. He just wants to
have fun.
But the slate includes three mem
bers — Jim Suhre, Alex Danel and
Chris Adamson — who do have some
serious things to say, despite Wein
stein's attempts to keep them laugh
ing.
"We're not all jokes," said Suhre in
Wednesday night's debate, explaining
that the slate's members had brought
the Chaparral out of the red. "We
know how to run a business."
Adamson said the slate plans to
fight a recent Athletic Department
decision to cut funding for five varsity
sports.
Danel laid out plans for a new stu
dent center to be built by 1988 in
Manzanita Park, and emphasized that
he will improve the Concert Network.
"The Real Solution," the slate of
ASSU insiders who think student
government is not a joking matter,
say the "Josh" proposals are at best,
unworkable, and at worst, insulting.
"By making everything into a joke,
you belittle some important issues,"
said slate member Kim Crawford.
"The Real Solution" — with
Crawford, Rudy Fuentes, Mary
Thurber and Carey White — is run
ning largely on a platform of minority
issues: the value of theme houses,
awareness of racism, ethnocentricity
in the Western Culture program. The
slate members say their opponents

are guilty of "subtle racism" by play
ing these campus issues off as jokes.
"There are important issues out
there," said Fuentes. "We're not
joking around, because someone has
to take them seriously."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons argues that there is a place for
humor in student government, but
not for insensitivity.
"I want to take student govern
ment very seriously, because it has
serious roles to play in this Univer
sity," Lyons said. "If student gov
ernment should ever become the
vehicle for nothing but humor ... it
becomes self-serving."
Lyons is frank in his appraisal of
the humor displayed by this years
student government, particularly a
"white supremacist" announcement
and " ASSU Blues," a recent edition
of "ASSU News," both published in
The Daily.
"The white supremacist ad was
meant to be humor," he said. "1
didn't find it funny. It led me to won
der whether they in fact harbor some
right-wing views."
Lyons called the ethnic humor in
the ASSU newsletter "tasteless gar
bage."
"If they thought that was humor,
they missed the mark by a wide
country mile," Lyons said.
Weinstein, editor of the newsletter,
showed a serious side when he
apologized for the "grievous mis
take" in a letter to The Daily.
Asked whether he is worried that
people perceive the "Josh" slate as
racist because it does not appear to
take minority issues seriously.
Weinstein said, "I don't care what
people say, because I know I'm not
racist or bigoted. It's a political ac
cusation."
Weinstein argues that "The Real
Solution" takes itself a little too seri
ously, and the slate's members smile
at the accusation.

"We do take ourselves a little too
seriously," said White, "but when you
get down to it, you find that we're
easygoing and really good with
people."
White says it is "a healthy thing" to
have the "Josh" slate, composed of
four Chaparral staff members, in the
election, and he adds that the current
COP, also Chaparral staffers, have
done a good job this year.
But White feels that the student
government will need experienced
leaders next year, and he says that
only his slate can provide that experi
ence.
"It helps to have at least one or two
people on the slate know the details,
know how things function," White
said, noting that several experienced
ASSU senators will be leaving this
year.
Current COP members Mike Col
lins and Leslie Leland argue that
ASSU experience is not an important
prerequisite to the COP job.
"Any bozo can be president," said
Leland, noting that responsiveness to
students is the most important quality
for ASSU leaders to possess.
Collins said it is irrelevant that

perience in the ASSU. 'Goodness
