# Golfers 4th in home tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
How did the Stanford men's golf team do in the U.S.
Intercollegiate here at the Stanford Golf Couse this
weekend? Well, listen to Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf.
"As a group, most of the people have played better
here before,' Schaaf said. "I think on our own course,
everyone else on the team expected to play a little
better than we did."
Hard to tell the Cardinal finished fourth, one of their
strongest finishes of the season, isn't it?
Actually, Schaaf was both pleased and proud of his
team's performance, especially yesterday as it rose
from ninth place after 27 holes. But, and Schaaf would
be the first to admit it, it seems that Stanford is so used
to winning at home, it needs to remind itself that its
showing against such a challenging field was impres
sive.
"I see some good signs," Schaaf said. "We haven't
completely shaken off the winter yet but it looks like
we're getting there."
USC hung on to edge out Fresno State for the tour
nament championship by two strokes ( 1 124-1 126),
with Arizona State settling for third despite an excel
lent final round.
"On the West Coast the top three teams have been

USC, Arizona State and Fresno State," Schaaf said.
'We've solidified ourselves as the fourth-ranked team."
Stanford's third round of 366 tied for low round of
the tournament, leaving it at 1141, just seven strokes
behind ASU.
"We seemed to get a little bit untracked today,"
Schaaf said. "The scoring still was pretty high — even
though the weather was perfect the course still played
tough. I was very, very pleased with how we played this
afternoon."
It was the cold, blustery conditions of Saturday that
really caused the golfers' ("survivors of the arctic," as
Athletic Director Andy Geiger termed them) scores to
balloon. USC and FSU tied for low score in the first
round with a 381; by contrast, over 10 teams golfed
that well or better in the third round.
Freshman Roger Miraglia led the Cardinal by
shooting 224, including a pair of 73s on the par-71
course, good for 10th place in the tournament.
"He's made more improvements in four months than
any player since I've been here," Schaaf said. "He's re
ally become a solid starter."
Don Walsworth and Carl Wagner shot 228 and 229,
respectively, while John Dickey, after a slow start, fired
Stanford's best round, a7l in the third, to finish at 231.
Rich Marik wound up at 235, and Phil Rowley con
cluded at 238.
