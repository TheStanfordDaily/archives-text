. Reagan meets with Nakasone
WASHINGTON — U.S. and Japanese officials say President Reagan
has a firm promise from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that the
Japanese leader will institute a program designed to restructure
Japanese society to satisfy his country's Western trading partners.
Nakasone, the officials said, is determined to rid Japan of its long
coveted trade surplus and convert its people into more leisurely,
higher-living and import-hungry consumers.
That was the conclusion drawn yesterday by officials from both sides
following a casual, midday meeting between the two leaders at the presi
dent's Camp David retreat in the Maryland mountains.
After years of concentrating nearly all their commercial efforts on de
veloping an economy built on exports, the Japanese now realize that
policy "is having a serious and adverse impact on relations with this
country and others in the world,'' said one U.S. official briefing reporters
after the meeting.
And a Japanese official who, like the American, described the talks on
condition he not be identified, said Reagan spoke of "mounting frustra
tion in the United States" over the inability of U.S. firms to compete
with Japanese products in either country.
The United States has about a $50 billion trade deficit with Japan.
"The prime minister said he realized Japan can't continue as is," the
official said. "It is high time for the Japanese economy to change its own
structure."
An American official who attended the talks said Nakasone assured
Reagan he is "determined to effect an historic change" in Japanese
lifestyle and culture to accommodate Western markets and interests.
Reagan, he said, was "impressed by the commitment and determination
of the prime minister" to eliminate the huge trade imbalance between
Japan and the West.
The prime minister also expressed sympathy to Reagan for the most
recent terrorist attack in Berlin in which an American soldier was killed
and more than 200 people, including 63 U.S. military personnel, were
wounded, the official said.
Feuding coalition reaches agreement
JERUSALEM — The feuding partners in Israel's coalition govern
ment agreed on a compromise yesterday that would see the finance and
justice ministers swap jobs in a bid to save the government. Prime
Minister Shimon Peres announced.
Peres had delayed the weekly Sunday Cabinet session twice, for more
than 13 hours, to allow his leftist Labor party and the rightist Likud bloc
headed by Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir to seek agreement.
Under the pact, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and Justice Minister
Moshe Nissim will exchange jobs, he said. Both are leaders of the small
liberal faction of the Likud bloc.
"There will be an exchange of portfolios. The minister of justice will
become the minister of finance, and the minister of finance will become
the minister of justice," Peres told reporters after a 10-minute Cabinet
meeting.
The conflict began earlier this month when Peres demanded Modai
leave the Finance Ministry by yesterday, the day the compromise was
reached, for publicly criticizing Peres and his economic policies. Likud
said the coalition agreement prevented Peres from firing Modai without
Shamir's approval.
The two parties argued over who should replace Modai and Peres'
demand that Modai not return to the Finance Ministry after Shamir
takes over the premiership in October. The bitter dispute brought the
government to the brink of collapse, with Likud ministers threatening a
mass resignation.
But Peres said yesterday:"I do believe the whole story wound up to
my satisfaction."
Peres announced the compromise, which is to last throughout the life
of the government until November 1988, at the beginning of the Cabinet
meeting, said Economics Minister Gad Yaakobi.
Yaakobi told The Associated Press the exchange of portfolios would
have to be approved by Parliament, probably on Wednesday.
Explosion caused Mexicana crash
NEW YORK— Investigators seeking the cause of the Mexicana Air
lines crash that killed 166 people last month have found strong evidence
the disaster was caused by an explosion in a wheel well, the New York
Times reported in today's editions.
The newspaper cited sources close to the inquiry into the March 31
crash as saying indications are that the explosion would more likely have
been caused by a mechanical problem with landing gear, such as an
exploding tire, than by a bomb.
The Times reported that none of the indicators that normally point to
sabotage, such as a residue of explosives or telltale patterns of structural
rupture, have been detected in the wreckage of the Boeing 727. The
newspaper also said investigators had not ruled sabotage out.
Stalin's daughter to return to West
NEW YORK — Stalin's daughter, who defected to the West in 1967
but returned to the Soviet Union in 1984, says she has received permis
sion to once again leave that country, the New York Times reported in
today's editions.
"I requested permission to leave and I got it," Svetlana Alliluyeva told
the newspaper yesterday in a telephone interview from her Moscow
hotel.
Alliluyeva said she planned to leave the Soviet Union by the end of
the month and was not sure when and if she would ever return, the
Times said.
"I can't think so far into the future." the newspaper quoted her as
saying. She declined to answer questions on what prompted her decision
to again leave the Soviet Union, which her father, Josef, ruled from the
late 1920s until his death in 1953.
In 1984, 17 years after defecting to the West in India and renouncing
her Soviet citizenship, Alliluyeva created a stir when she returned to
Moscow with her daughter, who was then 13 years old.
The daughter was born in the United States while Alliluyeva was mar
ried to William Wesley Peters, an American architect. They were di
vorced in 1973.
Alliluyeva, 59. and her daughter were granted Soviet citizenship by
special decree the year they returned.
According to the Times, an American diplomat said the State De
partment still considered Alliluyeva and her daughter to be U.S. citizeas.

In 1984, 17 years after defecting to the West in India and renouncing
her Soviet citizenship, Alliluyeva created a stir when she returned to
Moscow with her daughter, who was then 13 years old.
The daughter was born in the United States while Alliluyeva was mar
ried to William Wesley Peters, an American architect. They were di
vorced in 1973.
Alliluyeva, 59. and her daughter were granted Soviet citizenship by
special decree the year they returned.
According to the Times, an American diplomat said the State De
partment still considered Alliluyeva and her daughter to be U.S. citizeas.

39 others were injured early today in a stampede by Hindus during a
huge religious celebration at the city of Hardwar on the banks of the
Ganges River.
The stampede occurred as millions of pilgrims thronged Hardwar for a
dip in the Ganges on the climax of the festival of Khumbh Mela, held
once every 12 years.
The dead included 32 women and two children, the United News of
India news agency said.
It quoted police sources assaying the stampede occurred when one of
the pilgrims fell down in the crush of people and a crowd of others fell on
top of him.
Piles of clothes and luggage were strewn near the main bathing area in
Hardwar. which is located 150 miles northeast of New Delhi.
At least 500 people were killed in a stampede in Hardwar in 1954
during the festival, which draws more people than any other religious
event in the world.
. Reagan meets with Nakasone
WASHINGTON — U.S. and Japanese officials say President Reagan
has a firm promise from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that the
Japanese leader will institute a program designed to restructure
Japanese society to satisfy his country's Western trading partners.
Nakasone, the officials said, is determined to rid Japan of its long
coveted trade surplus and convert its people into more leisurely,
higher-living and import-hungry consumers.
That was the conclusion drawn yesterday by officials from both sides
following a casual, midday meeting between the two leaders at the presi
dent's Camp David retreat in the Maryland mountains.
After years of concentrating nearly all their commercial efforts on de
veloping an economy built on exports, the Japanese now realize that
policy "is having a serious and adverse impact on relations with this
country and others in the world,'' said one U.S. official briefing reporters
after the meeting.
And a Japanese official who, like the American, described the talks on
condition he not be identified, said Reagan spoke of "mounting frustra
tion in the United States" over the inability of U.S. firms to compete
with Japanese products in either country.
The United States has about a $50 billion trade deficit with Japan.
"The prime minister said he realized Japan can't continue as is," the
official said. "It is high time for the Japanese economy to change its own
structure."
An American official who attended the talks said Nakasone assured
Reagan he is "determined to effect an historic change" in Japanese
lifestyle and culture to accommodate Western markets and interests.
Reagan, he said, was "impressed by the commitment and determination
of the prime minister" to eliminate the huge trade imbalance between
Japan and the West.
The prime minister also expressed sympathy to Reagan for the most
recent terrorist attack in Berlin in which an American soldier was killed
and more than 200 people, including 63 U.S. military personnel, were
wounded, the official said.
Feuding coalition reaches agreement
JERUSALEM — The feuding partners in Israel's coalition govern
ment agreed on a compromise yesterday that would see the finance and
justice ministers swap jobs in a bid to save the government. Prime
Minister Shimon Peres announced.
Peres had delayed the weekly Sunday Cabinet session twice, for more
than 13 hours, to allow his leftist Labor party and the rightist Likud bloc
headed by Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir to seek agreement.
Under the pact, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and Justice Minister
Moshe Nissim will exchange jobs, he said. Both are leaders of the small
liberal faction of the Likud bloc.
"There will be an exchange of portfolios. The minister of justice will
become the minister of finance, and the minister of finance will become
the minister of justice," Peres told reporters after a 10-minute Cabinet
meeting.
The conflict began earlier this month when Peres demanded Modai
leave the Finance Ministry by yesterday, the day the compromise was
reached, for publicly criticizing Peres and his economic policies. Likud
said the coalition agreement prevented Peres from firing Modai without
Shamir's approval.
The two parties argued over who should replace Modai and Peres'
demand that Modai not return to the Finance Ministry after Shamir
takes over the premiership in October. The bitter dispute brought the
government to the brink of collapse, with Likud ministers threatening a
mass resignation.
But Peres said yesterday:"I do believe the whole story wound up to
my satisfaction."
Peres announced the compromise, which is to last throughout the life
of the government until November 1988, at the beginning of the Cabinet
meeting, said Economics Minister Gad Yaakobi.
Yaakobi told The Associated Press the exchange of portfolios would
have to be approved by Parliament, probably on Wednesday.
Explosion caused Mexicana crash
NEW YORK— Investigators seeking the cause of the Mexicana Air
lines crash that killed 166 people last month have found strong evidence
the disaster was caused by an explosion in a wheel well, the New York
Times reported in today's editions.
The newspaper cited sources close to the inquiry into the March 31
crash as saying indications are that the explosion would more likely have
been caused by a mechanical problem with landing gear, such as an
exploding tire, than by a bomb.
The Times reported that none of the indicators that normally point to
sabotage, such as a residue of explosives or telltale patterns of structural
rupture, have been detected in the wreckage of the Boeing 727. The
newspaper also said investigators had not ruled sabotage out.
Stalin's daughter to return to West
NEW YORK — Stalin's daughter, who defected to the West in 1967
but returned to the Soviet Union in 1984, says she has received permis
sion to once again leave that country, the New York Times reported in
today's editions.
"I requested permission to leave and I got it," Svetlana Alliluyeva told
the newspaper yesterday in a telephone interview from her Moscow
hotel.
Alliluyeva said she planned to leave the Soviet Union by the end of
the month and was not sure when and if she would ever return, the
Times said.
"I can't think so far into the future." the newspaper quoted her as
saying. She declined to answer questions on what prompted her decision
to again leave the Soviet Union, which her father, Josef, ruled from the
late 1920s until his death in 1953.
In 1984, 17 years after defecting to the West in India and renouncing
