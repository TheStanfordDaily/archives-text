# Foreigners moved to Libyan bases?
## Bishop of Tripoli reportedly arrested by gunmen in Benghazi 
### 
TRIPOLI, Libya — With U.S. warships cruising
nearby waters, Libya announced that it had forced
foreign workers, including U.S. citizens, to settle in
oil fields and army camps it claims are targets for
attacks by the United States.
A western diplomat, however, said yesterday
that there was no indication that any such forced
migration of foreigners had been carried out by the
government of Col. Moammar Khadafy. Libya
vowed it was ready to strike back at any assailant:
"Libya does not want aggression and does not work
to cause it," said a foreign ministry statement car
ried by the official J AN A news agency. "However,
if aggression is carried against it, it will retaliate
forcefully against all targets which constitute rear
bases for the aggression." The statement, moni
tored in London, did not say what was meant by
"rear bases."
Despite the rhetoric, Tripoli has remained quiet
for days and there were no signs yesterday of any
military preparation.
A statement released by a Libyan Information
Ministry official, who refused to be identified, said

"foreign workers have been forced to live in them
(oil fields) taking into account that the majority are
Americans."
The.statement also said: "The military camps
have been handed over to foreigners to repair them
and to use them to live there. Foreign workers have
been moved to army camps."
"Libya has got information that America is going
to attack several army camps and oil fields and pet
rochemical companies."
The Libyan statement said the moves took place
Saturday and that the army has been moved to un
disclosed locations.
In another important development, armed men
took away and apparently arrested the leader of the
Roman Catholic Church in Libya along with three
other priests and a nun in the coastal city of Ben
ghazi, source said yesterday.
A source close to Msgr. Giovanni Martinelli, 44,
the Bishop of Tripoli, told the Associated Press that
Martinelli was escorted away Thursday night while
on a visit to the western Libyan city along the
Mediterranean.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonym
ity, said Martinelli, a Libyan-born son of Italian pa
rents, had been staying in a house in Benghazi
along with the other priests and the nun.
Armed men entered the house and the five
"were taken away by unknown persons, but it cer
tainly seems to us that they were arrested," the
source said, adding he did not know how many
armed people had come to the house.
It could not be determined why the five may have
been arrested.
Italy's ambassador, Giorgio Reitano, was taking
undisclosed steps in an attempt to free the five, said
the source, adding: "But right now, it's not even
known where they are. It's terrible.''
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told re
porters covering Pope John Paul ll's historic visit to
Rome's main synagogue yesterday that the news
reports appeared to be true and that there would be
an official Vatican statement today on the case.
A Libyan Information Ministry spokesman
would say only: "In the Libyan media, there has
been nothing about it."
