# Official says U.S. willing to 'back away'

### 
WASHINGTON — The United
States would back away from its con
frontation with Col. Moammar
Khadafy if the Libyan leader changes
his conduct and stops plotting dozens
of terrorist acts worldwide, a top
State Department official says.
Deputy Secretary of State John
Whitehead, appearing yesterday on
the CBS-TV program "Face the Na
tion," said if Khadafy "stops training
terrorists, financing terrorists, sup
plying them with arms, supplying
them with documents ... we would
certainly back away from our ac
tions."
Whitehead, the No. 2 official at the

State Department, said the strategy
behind the United States making
known possible plans for military
force against Libya was the hope that
Khadafy will change his conduct —
not the desire to overthrow the Li
byan leader.
"The object of all this is to get
Khadafy to change his conduct,"
Whitehead said. "That is our objec
tive. We're not out to overthrow him.
We're not out to remove him in any
way."
Whitehead said U.S. officials have
information implicating Khadafy in
the bombing of a West Berlin night

club in which an American service
man was killed, and that Khadafy is
plotting "literally dozens of other ter
rorist actions around the world."
Vice President George Bush said
yesterday that "Libyans have their
fingerprints all over state-sponsored
terrorism," and the United States has
a duty to punish those who threaten
Americans overseas.
President Reagan is weighing the
use of military force against Libya in
retaliation for the attack. Whitehead
said, but added, "The prospect of
military action is something that only
the president will decide on. He has
not yet made that decision."

Reagan last week indicated his wil
lingness to take military action if the
perpetrators could be identified and
an appropriate target located.
Two U.S. aircraft carriers, the
America and Coral Sea, which last
month engaged Libyan forces in the
disputed Gulf of Sidra, remained
"underway in the Mediterranean,"
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Larry
Icenogle said. Pentagon sources said
Saturday the carriers were awaiting
orders off the coast of Sicily.
The Reagan Administration was
consulting with members of Congress
and U.S. allies in Western Europe
over the next step against Khadafy.
