Meese meets agents
MIAMI — The two slain robbery suspects who
killed two FBI agents and wounded five others
had no criminal records and were described as
hard-working family men, best friends who lived
seemingly quiet lives in a pleasant suburban
community.
U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese made a
special visit to Miami yesterday to meet with the
wounded agents and praise their work.
"I just told them how grateful we were for
their actions. I do know that this was an excellent
job of locating two very dangerous bank rob
bers," he said.
One of the dead suspects was recently profiled
as a born-again Christian in Home Life, a Chris
tian family magazine. Both had remarried after
their first wives died violently.
William Matix, 34, and Michael Piatt, 32, were
killed Friday in a bloody gunbattle with FBI
agents behind a shopping center in the suburban,
unincorporated community of Kendall.
Meese said the agents acted appropriately
during the shootout, which took place in a resi
dential neighborhood.
Mattix and Piatt have been linked to at least a
half-dozen bank and armored car robberies in
Dade County during the last year, according to
law enforcement officials.
California grape boycott
BOSTON — Cesar Chavez, president of the
United Farm Workers union, told supporters
yesterday to spread the word to boycott all

California-grown table grapes because growers
persist in spraying the plants with five chemicals
he says are dangerous.
Chavez, urging consumers to "protect them
selves by boycotting grapes," said chemical re
sidues sprayed on many grape varieties had sic
kened and killed some vineyard workers.
The boycott, instituted by the union last May,
extends to all seeded and seedless grapes, but not
to wines, grape juices or raisins, Chavez said.
"The public should be concerned about the
pesticides contained in their food," he said.
"Doesn't the consumer have a responsibility to
know what is in the food they feed their children?
He said pesticide residues had caused birth
defects, blindness and cancer among vineyard
workers. He said some workers have died re
cently from exposure to the pesticides.
A union proposal that growers test the grapes
for chemicals and publicize the results was re
jected by the California Table Grape Commis
sion, Chavez added.
David Stirling, general counsel to the Califor
nia Farm Labor Board, has labeled irresponsible
Chavez's charges that the pesticides could cause
diseases to consumers.
Alleged mobster killed
NEW YORK— A bomb exploded under a car
parked on a Brooklyn street yesterday, killing the
reputed No. 2 man in the Gambino crime family
and critically injuring another suspected
organized-crime figure, police said.
The dead man was identified as Frank De-
Cicco, 58, of Staten Island. In January, law

enforcement authorities said DeCicco was named
underboss of the Gambino family by its reputed
leader, John Gotti, The New York Times said.
The other victim, Frank Bellino, 65, whose ad
dress was not known, is a suspected member of
the Lucchese crime family, said police Sgt.
Raymond O'Donnell, who identified DeCicco as
a suspected "high-ranking member" of the Gam
bino family.
The men were approaching the car when the
bomb exploded and were taken by a police patrol
car to Victory Memorial Hospital, where De-
Cicco died, O'Donnell said.
The bomb, which police described as a "high
intensity explosive device," had been placed on
the ground beneath the front seat of the 1985
Buick Electra, O'Donnell said.
Accident mars festival
PONCH ATOULA, La. — A car driven by the
elderly mother of the parish sheriff went out of
control and plowed through a crowd walking to
the annual Strawberry Festival, killing one per
son and injuring as many as 30, authorities said.
Three people, including a 17-month-old child,
were critically injured, authorities said.
Residents grabbed blankets and ice packs and
turned their driveways and carports into first-aid
stations, while ambulances tried to make it
through jammed streets, police said.
The driver of the car was identified by police as
Inez Layrisson, about 80, mother of Tangipahoa
Parish Sheriff Ed Layrisson. She suffered cuts
and bruises in the accident and was under obser
