LOS ANGELES — Delegates to the Califor
nia Young Republicans convention yesterday en
dorsed Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos) for the
U.S. Senate nomination to oppose incumbent
Democrat Alan Cranston, a spokesman an
nounced.
Zschau, competing against 12 other candidates
for the nomination, was the only person nomi
nated during the vote at the Los Angeles Airport
Hilton. Eighty-two percent of the votes cast went
to Zschau, said Cathy Ferrar, state chairman of
the California Young Republicans, which has
4,000 members statewide.
"What this means is that the campaign is on
target in appealing to that very important group
of young Republicans under 40," said Sandra
Conlan, press secretary for the Zschau campaign.
Three hundred members of the organization
attended the convention, where 120 delegates
voted to endorse several candidates. Gov.
George Deukmejian received the group's en
dorsement for re-election. Mike Curb was sup

MIA market denounced
SAN FRANCISCO — A black market in MI A
remains appears to inhibit efforts to recover the
bodies of U.S. servicemen missing in action in In
dochina, a newspaper reported in today's edi

tions.
"Underground trafficking in genuine, fraudu
lent and indeterminate skeletal remains and/or
personal effects of deceased American military
personnel flourishes in Thailand and Southern
Laos," said the San Francisco Chronicle, in
quoting a classified report that the newspaper
said had been prepared for Sen. William
Armstrong ( R-Colo.) by William Cassidy, a con
sulting investigator to the Senate and a specialist
in Southeast Asian affairs.
The Cassidy report, which the newspaper said
was based on an investigation that began with a
tip from San Francisco Bay Area Vietnamese
refugees, said the trade amounted to a "sophisti
cated, well-organized black market having a de
fined structure and hierarchy," according to the
Chronicle.
The U.S. government's refusal to deal directly
with anti-Communist resistance forces that have
recovered MIA remains, according to the report,
"has encouraged a variety of go-betweens, pro
fiteers and intelligence fabricators to engage in a
host of frauds and deceptions."
Officials tied to polluters
SACRAMENTO — Five members of a reg
ional water quality control board — all appoin
tees of Gov. George Deukmejian — have had
ties to sewer districts or companies that have

been cited or admonished for polluting water, the
Sacramento Bee said yesterday.
The orders to stop polluting were issued or re
commended by Roy Hampson, who was fired
Friday from his job as executive director of the
eight-member Lahontan Regional Water Quality
Control Board.
Board members said Hampson was fired be
cause he repeatedly resisted their directives, the
Bee said. They said there were no political
reasons involved in the dismissal, a motive
Hampson's supporters suggest.
The Board's duties involve monitoring, pro
tecting and enforcing water quality standards in
an area that stretches along the eastern slope of
the Sierra Nevada, from Oregon to the desert and
mountains of Southern California.
The Board's chairman, Dale Sare, a South
Lake Tahoe attorney, represents an aircraft ser
vice company that was cited by the board's staff
earlier this year for polluting the upper Truckee
River, according to the Bee.
The State Attorney General's office raised a
conflict-of-interest concern last week over Sare's
connection to the company, Jimsair Inc.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today. Chance of rain in af
ternoon from San Francisco northward with a
slight chance elsewhere. Highs in the upper 50s
to low 70s, variable winds to 15 mph.
