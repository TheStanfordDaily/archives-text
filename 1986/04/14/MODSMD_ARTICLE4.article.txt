# Protesters' trial to begin today

### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
Twenty-two students and one
Stanford professor will go on trial at
8:30 a.m. today to face charges
stemming from October anti
apartheid sit-ins at Old Union.
Presiding over the trial at the Palo
Alto Municipal Court will be Judge
Franklin Elia. Elia was assigned to
the case earlier this month after the
District Attorney's office issued a
peremptory challenge to prevent
black judge La Doris Cordell from
hearing the case.
Elia is the same judge who presided
over last July's trial, in which a jury
found nine Stanford students guilty of
trespassing and refusing to disperse
— charges incurred during a May 28
anti-apartheid sit-in at Old Union.
Elia gave the students the option of
probation for a period of three
months, after which time their re
cords would be cleared if they broke
no laws.
Elia expressed sympathy for last
summer's protesters, saying, "1 think
I understand where you're coming
from. As far as apartheid is con
cerned, I don't think any decent
civilized human being can disagree
with your arguments." However, he
added, "The law is very clear on the
subject of trespassing."
Today's trial involves charges of
trespassing, unlawful assembly and

refusal to disperse following anti
apartheid demonstrations at Stanford
Oct. 11, 14 and 16.
Forty-eight protesters were ar
rested during the demonstrations for
refusing to leave Old Union when the
building closed in protest of the racist
apartheid policy in South Africa and
the University's refusal to divest of
investments in companies that do
business in that country. Twenty
three of the 48 will stand trial today.
Despite what he described as last
year's relatively lenient sentencing.
Deputy District Attorney Peter Waite
said he will try to prosecute for the
maximum sentencing for the charges
of trespassing, unlawful assembly and
refusal to disperse. Each charge car
ries a maximum penalty of one year in
a county jail and a fine not to exceed
$ 1,000, he said.
"That's my job," Waite said, ad
ding, "There's no reason not to have
laws enforced equally, whether we
are dealing with a poor person or a
rich Stanford student."
But Waite conceded that he doesn't
think maximum sentencing is a prob
able outcome. "I've never seen any
one impose maximum sentencing — I
don't want to speculate, but I don't
think it is very likely," he said.
Waite said he expects the trial to
last at least two weeks, but County
Public Defender Aram James, who
represents seven of the 23 defen
dants, said that he estimates the time
from pre-trial motions through ver

diet to last anywhere from one to four
weeks, depending on what defenses
the court will allow.
James said that he will be raising
what is known as the "necessity de
fense," which essentially says that
even though a law was technically

violated, it was done to prevent a
greater harm of the law, thus making
it acceptable.
There are six attorneys for the de
fense, and three of the students plan
to act as their own attorneys, accord
ing to James.
