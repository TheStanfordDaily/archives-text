# Art flourishes in classroom

"I do it basically for the fun of it," said senior Jon
Kaplan. "There's a certain something about the
thought of 6.000 degrees in my hands â€” a real
feeling of power."
Kaplan, an International Relations/Math Sci
ences major, was describing an activity that the
Schwinn company never quite foresaw: welding to
gether pieces of two bicycles to create a human
figure.

Some 20 students explored such avenues in two
winter quarter classes, introduction to Assemblage
and Introduction to Sculpture. Their collected
works are currently on display in the basement
hallway of the Art Building until April 22.
The students' art, crafted chiefly from metal,
cardboard and wood but including such materials as
a telephone receiver and broken glass, strikes the
observer as being intensely personal expressions of
creativity.
"These projects represent prob
lems of logic stressing the visual as
pect," explained the courses' in
structor Richard Putz, an experienced
sculptor and 1981 graduate of Stan
ford's Master of Fine Arts program.
'T stress the hands-on approach
rather than the book approach. It's
tough for beginning students to come
into a class like this without any trad

itional 'shop' experience. It's a lot
harder than it looks."
And this class definitely had its
trying moments. When was the last
time your English professor tore up
two-thirds of your only copy of a 30-
page creative essay? Can you recall a
course where your midterm essay was
distributed to all the class members
for an in-class critique?
Each piece on display at the stu
dent show in the Cummings Art
Building was subjected to such
scrutiny. Recognizing that many of
the students in the class were being

confronted by new problems and new
ways of thinking, Putz advanced the
students slowly. In their first specific
project they could use only
cardboard. Their second project was
restructured to two materials and the
students could choose their own
materials for their final project.

The students weren't exactly free to
ignore quality when experimenting on
their own, however.
"My second work was completely
destroyed during a critique session,"
said Anamary Smith, an undeclared
sophomore. "And my final work got
twisted about 180 degrees."

Her assemblage began as an explo
ration into a "broken heart" theme
but evolved into an abstracted study
of color and form stressing an aged,
antique look and feel.
"I wanted to take something
apart," Smith said. "When was the
last time you did something like
that?" She also stressed that her work
is important to her because it chroni
cles her break from conventional
ways of thinking.
Putz said that he encourages the
predictable critics of such studio clas

ses to try their hand at an art class and
discover why many of their Stanford
peers continue to dabble in sculpture
after their first class experience. "Out
of some 20 students last quarter, I've
got three who arranged independent
studies in sculpture this quarter," he
said.
Besides two class meetings and an
open studio each week, the student
artists heard a guest lecture, visited
the Stanford Art Museum and its
Rodin collection, and trekked to San
Francisco for a tour of the Museum of
Modern Art and several art galleries.
