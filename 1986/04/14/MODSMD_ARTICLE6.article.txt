### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
A small, smoky fire late yesterday
morning caused extensive damage to
a mechanical engineering experiment
in Building 500.
The fire was confined to a second
floor thermoscience laboratory in the
low, stone building, one of the vener
able engineering structures from
pre-Campus West days that parallel
the south side of the Main Quad
rangle.
Although several students were in
the building at the time, there were
no reported injuries. The Stanford
Risk Management team was called as
a precautionary measure but hazard
ous materials were not involved in the
incident.
According to Battalion Chief Don
Dudak of the Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment. damage was confined to a room
containing a heat transfer experiment
by Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Robert Moffat. Although smoke and

water damage to the rest of the
building was minimal, Capt. Richard
Rogers estimated damage to the ex
periment itself would total in excess
of $100,000.
A failed and overheated cooling
system appeared to be the cause of
the smoky blaze in the $250,000 ex
periment, which represented more
than two years of work, Dudak said.
Palo Alto Communication Services
received a report of the fire at ap
proximately 11:30 p.m., said Stanford
Police Sgt. Ernest Brooks. Nearby
police units arrived at the scene in
approximately one minute, followed
quickly by fire department vehicles.
Although it has not yet been de
termined whether an alarm system
detected the fire, firefighters reported
that the alarm was activated by the
time the first fire units arrived.
The fire was controlled in "less
than 10 minutes," Dudak said. Seven
pieces of equipment and 15
firefighters eventually responded to
the alarm.
