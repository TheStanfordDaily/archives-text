Calling U.S. policy in Europe
"reactive and unfocused in respect
to arms control," the co-director of
Stanford's Center on International
Security and Arms Control said in a
speech here Saturday that Euro
peans are seeking to play a more
independent role in determining
their own foreign policies.
Speaking in Annenberg Au
ditorium, Political Science Prof.
John Lewis, who is also chairman of
the International Strategic Institute
at Stanford, said he feared the
United States may have lost its
chance for pioneering new arms
control measures in Europe. "The
initiative has passed into European
and Soviet hands," he said.
Saying that European leaders
consider "the conventional nuclear
arms build-up not as necessary as
the U.S. believes," Lewis credited
them for introducing arms control
into the strategic negotiations of the
superpowers.
Although he said that "what will
happen between the 27th and 28th
Soviet (Communist Party) Con
gresses is not all that clear," Lewis
predicted that the Soviet Union
would place much more emphasis
upon negotiating with the Euro
peans directly.
Lewis characterized the new gen
eration of Soviets as "yupniks" who
he said desire cars and other
luxuries, as their U.S. counterparts
do. "The Russians no longer feel
that they're in a two-part situa
tion. . .. There has been a change
in mood," he said. Consequently,
Lewis predicted the Soviets would
attempt to introduce non-military

issues, like collective economic se
curity, into the dialogue.
Lewis divided the goals of U.S.
policy in Europe into four parts: to
strengthen the cooperation be
tween the NATO allies; lessen
East-West reliance upon nuclear
weapons; to minimize East-West
confrontations; and to develop
more sophisticated methods for de
aling with variable factors such as
terrorism and nuclear accidents.
In his discussion of current
U.S.-Soviet security negotiations,
Lewis cited three major talks: the
Mutual and Balanced Force Re
duction talks (MBFR), the

Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force
talks (INF), and the Conference in
Security and Confidence-Building
Measures in Europe (CDE).
MBFR began in 1973 and con
cerns the strategic deployment of
conventional weapons in Europe.
From the outset, these talks have
been plagued by the problems of
on-site inspections and unverifiable
troop counts. While these negotia
tions have yielded no tangible re
sults, Lewis said that "at least
what's happened is that the two
sides are talking, exchanging infor
mation, getting to know each
other."
