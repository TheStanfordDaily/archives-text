# Before you buy an upgrade from anyone with a fancy
color ad, put them to the test: Ask them if they use
sockets. Then ask what kind. Are they tin or gold?
Closed or open frame? With four contacts or one? At
Mac Doctor , we use the best sockets money can
buy. OPEN FRAME, FOUR-CONTACT, GOLD sockets. That means your
memory chips will stay cool, stay in place, and stay in good electrical
contact-a few features well worth their weight in gold.
Mac Doctor, we know
I I how to spend your money.

tives to this standard view? What if the voices of women, minorities and non-Christians were heard?
What if... ?
