# U.S. bombs Libya in retaliation against terrorism
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff With wire reports 
The United States staged a series of air strikes against
Libyan targets yesterday to "pre-empt and discourage"
Libyan-sponsored terrorism, the White House announced
last night.
A group of F-111 warplanes bombed military targets in
the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi at about 4 p.m.
Pacific time in what Reagan Administration officials
characterized as a "signal" to Libyan leader Col. Moam
mar Khadafy that there are "costs" for sponsoring ter
rorism against U.S. citizens.
In an address to the nation, President Reagan justified
the bombings by presenting what he called "irrefutable
evidence" that Libya was behind the bombing of a West
Berlin nightclub April 5 that left one U.S. soldier dead.
The president said "evidence is now conclusive" that di
rectives were sent by Tripoli to agents in Libya's embassy
in East Germany to launch the attack on the La Belle dis
cotheque. Reagan said that the embassy sent a message

back to Libya after the bombing declaring the mission had
been a success.
"[Khadafy] counted on America to be passive," Reagan
said. "He counted wrong. . . . When our citizens are
abused or attacked anywhere in the world ... we will re
spond in self-defense."
Reagan added, "We have done what we had to do. .. .
If necessary, we will do it again."
Secretary of State George Shultz, briefing reporters
after the president's address, said the attack was "not a
question of settling scores," but a direct response to ter
rorists who think their actions carry no risks.
"We will take the action that is wise as we see the situa
tion unfold," Shultz said. "What is clear tonight is that the
United States will take military action under certain cir
cumstances."
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger called the air
strikes an "unmistakable signal" which will "go far toward
deterring further acts" of terrorism around the world.
Weinberger echoed an earlier statement by Reagan that
only military targets which were seen as part of Libya's
"terrorist infrastructure" were selected for bombing. He

added that he knew of no casualties on either side as a re
sult of the air strikes.
Late news reports and footage from Libya indicated
that the damage resulting from the air strikes was greater
than had earlier been suspected. Indications were that be
sides the military installations pointed out by Weinberger,
the well-to-do 7th of April district in Tripoli had been se
verely hit. The French Embassy was also reportedly dam
aged by the concussion of a bomb.
ABC's Charles Glass, reporting from Tripoli, said
scores of civilians — mostly Libyan, but some foreigners
— had been wounded. Eight children were reportedly
among that number.
According to Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole
(R-Kan.), congressional leaders were briefed about the air
strikes hours before they occurred. Dole said there would
have been time to call off the operation had there been
strong opposition from congressional leaders.
"There wasn't any substantial opposition," Dole said.
"There was a feeling that they should have been consulted
earlier."
There were no early reactions from U.S. allies, but

France and Spain reportedly refused the United States
permission to use their airspace as a path for planes to
conduct the attack. Heated dispute is expected in the
House of Commons tomorrow over British Prime Minis
ter Margaret Thatcher's decision to allow U.S. bombers to
launch their attack from British bases.
Early Soviet reaction was rhetorically sharp but other
wise muted. The commentary of political news analyst
Vladimir Goncharov was carried by the official Soviet
news agency, Tass, and said the United States "had
started speaking in its true tongue — the tongue of bombs,
flame and death."
Weinberger said an Air Force F-11 l jet was unac
counted for after the attack, but he did not know if it had
been shot down. Libyan radio said three U.S. planes had
been hit and the crew of one jet had been killed "by Li
byan citizens."
Weinberger said the attacks were mounted against five
targets near Tripoli and Benghazi using 18 F-11 1 bombers
from U.S. bases in England and 15 A-6 and A-7 attack
jets off the Navy carriers America and Coral
Sea.
A broadcast by Libya Radio, monitored
by the British Broadcasting Corp., said "the
savage American invaders carried out a
treacherous and barbaric air strike . . .
against the residence of the brother leader of

the revolution (Khadafy). A number of
members of the family of the brother leader
were injured as a result of this raid."
Knowledgeable officials said Khadafy's
headquarters was one target of the raid,
though it was not on the Pentagon's list of
targets. Reagan himself described the at
tacks as "concentrated and carefully
targeted to minimize casualties among Li
byan people, with whom we have no quar
rel."

Early reaction from Stanford was re
served. Hoover Fellow Lewis Gann, a
specialist in Africa and the Middle East, said
he wasn't willing to speculate on what might
occur next in the region because of the
fluidity of the situation. Gann said he hoped
the attack would serve as a deterrent to
further terrorism by the Khadafy regime,
though he would have preferred that the
United States use covert means to get their
message across.
