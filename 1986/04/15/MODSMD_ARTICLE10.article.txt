### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
Panelists speaking at History Corner
last night condemned atrocities they said
the El Salvadoran and Guatemalan gov
ernments have committed and unanim
ously supported the sanctuary movement
at Stanford.
According to Don Gagliardi, a member
of the Stanford sanctuary movement and a
first-year law student, the purpose of last
night s discussion was to educate students
on the campus-wide referendum on this
week's ASSU ballot.
The panel, which included a Stanford
law professor, a member of Amnesty In
ternational, a graduate student from El
Salvador and a refugee, discussed very
different aspects of refugees' situations,
but all said the Stanford sanctuary move

ment was worthy of support.
Law Prof. Bill Hing told the audience of
about 35 that U.S. immigration laws
"have no set provisions for people fleeing
Ã¼biquitous violence. Right now, you can
not be granted asylum just because you
fear for your life. You must show proof
that you have been singled out and will be
persecuted. This is virtually impossible to
do," he said.
"The United States has failed to inter
pret the immigration acts with any sense of
compassion," he said. "It is this insen
sitivity that has led to the need for a
sanctuary movement. The movement will
both provide support for refugees as well
as expose the U.S. for its complicity in the
atrocities in Guatemala and El Salvador."
Galen Hilgard, a member of the
sanctuary movement here, emphasized
Hing's political evaluation of the move

ment.
"In a university, it is fitting that the
sanctuary movement should take on a
political and educational role," she said.
"This means two things. First, that we
provide aid to refugees. Secondly, that we
stress publicity in our being a sanctuary
and educate the community that the U.S.
dollar is being used for oppression."
A refugee from El Salvador, who iden
tified herself only as Consuela, said
through an interpreter, "In my country it
is a crime to be young. The government
accuses the youth of subversion. Two of
my sons disappeared after they were ac
cused of subversion; they were both stu
dents, aged 14 and 16. I was forced to flee
the country after that to save my other
children.
"The truth is, in all honesty, that our
country is starving to death," she said.
