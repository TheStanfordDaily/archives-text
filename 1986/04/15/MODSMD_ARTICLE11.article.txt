University President Donald Kennedy will
address the Stanford community at an open
forum next month on governance and "humani
zation" of the University, Personnel Director
Rob Parker said yesterday.
The forum, arranged with Kennedy by a
student-faculty committee, is aimed at improv
ing relations between the University administ
ration and the community, according to Dow
Woodward, professor of biological sciences and
a member of the organizing committee. "It is
designed to probe questions of governance at
Stanford."
Among the participants will be Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley, an outspoken critic of
administration policies. But Parker emphasized
that the forum is "not intended to be a debate

between President Kennedy and Prof. Manley."
The forum, organized chiefly by Parker and
Lowell Price, associate provost in the Univer
sity's Office of Management and Budget, is
scheduled for Friday, May 9 at 7 p.m. in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
"There will be more publicity when the
agenda is finalized," Parker said, noting that the
list of speakers is not yet complete.
The idea for the forum emerged last fall,
during University disputes with the United
Stanford Workers, according to Woodward. He
said the forum has been expanded to include
several University issues in addition to labor.
The forum comes in the wake of Manley's
sharp criticism of the Kennedy administration
last week. Manley charged that the administra
tion stifles open discussion at Stanford.
Parker said the forum might lead to a series of
open meetings if it proves beneficial.
