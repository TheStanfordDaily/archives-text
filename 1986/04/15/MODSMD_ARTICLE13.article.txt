Prudence dictates
that fetus deserves
benefit of doubt
The recent appearance at Stanford
by abortion advocate Bill Baird was a
rather curious affair. Were the event's
organizers aware that an opposing
view exists, and if so. why was no one
invited to present it?
Had the pro-life position been rep
resented. Baird might have been
asked an obvious question: "Is the
fetus a human being?" Apparently
the distinction between the unborn
and the newborn is not always clear,
for abortionists occasionally kill in
fants ex litem which have frustrated
the good doctors' attempts to dis
patch them in ntero. Furthermore,
infants which are born months before
the end of the usual nine-month ges
tation period can now survive outside
the womb. Of course, even before a
fetus is viable, it has a heartbeat,
brain waves, fingers, toes and most of
the other characteristics which distin
guish a person from a baked potato.

To use Baird's arboreal analogy, a
12-week-old fetus looks much more
like a small oak tree than like an
acorn.
Given the difficulty of determining
exactly when life begins, prudence
dictates that we regard abortion as
the possible, even probable, destruc
tion of a human being. In the absence
of any compelling evidence that the
fetus is not a human being, abortion
on demand seems grossly irresponsi
ble at best.

Vote YES on
referendum for
stock divestment
Beginning this month. Bishop De
smond Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize, urged interna
tional economic sanctions against the
white minority government of South

Africa. He stated last fall that he
would call for economic sanctions
April 1 if no progress was made in
dismantling apartheid. He said his
appeal was to the people, "especially
the young people in the universities,
who have already helped change the
moral climate . . . against apartheid."
Already a number of universities,
most notably Columbia, as well as
states, cities and church organizations
have divested from divested from
South Africa. This week, students
here will have an opportunity to vote
on a referendum that states: "Stan
ford University should make an im
mediate commitment to totally divest
within a specified time frame from all
companies doing business in a South
Africa under apartheid laws."
Two decades ago, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. called for economic
sanctions against South Africa. Today
the United States is the No. 1 trader
with South Africa. Apartheid
maximizes the economic exploitation
of cheap black labor and as such it is
not reformable. Corporations that
argue that they provide jobs are not
looking clearly at the situation.
Apartheid means increased profits.

The Sullivan Principles are essentially
workplace guidelines, and Rev. Sulli
van, their author, has recently stated
that they are not enough. They do
nothing to challenge the fundamental
principle of apartheid.
The shanty in White Plaza reminds
us of the conditions of blacks in South
Africa. Tutu went on to say, "1 have
no hope of real change from this gov
ernment, unless they are forced." Di
vestment is a beginning, a first step
toward total corporate disengage
ment. We support Tutu's non-violent
strategy for change and we urge
Stanford students to vote yes on this
referendum.
