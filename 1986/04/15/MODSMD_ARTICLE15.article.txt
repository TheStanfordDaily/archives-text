The Advisory Referendum on Divestment, on which
students will vote on today and tomorrow, calls upon the
University to divest of its holdings incorporations that
do business in South Africa. It is, in other words, an in
itiative in support of "blanket" divestment.
Policy by referendum is a difficult business at best; this
referendum contains serious defects that make it more
difficult still. Last year, on the Motorola question, the very
same students who submitted the referendum wrote the
con argument as well as the pro argument: and this year
no con aJTgument at all appeal's in the Elections Handbook.
There is, of course, the explanation that the present re
ferendum qualified for the ballot by petition after the
ASSU Senate had stopped meeting for winter quarter.
But to have only one side presented in the election mate
rials is to strip the process of its essential claim to validity.
Without supposing that the following statement will
provide an adequate substitute for ballot arguments, we
nevertheless want to summarize some of the reasons for
opposing blanket divestment. These were discussed, often
at considerable length, during the events of last spring: but
many members of the community were not here then, or
were focused on other matters.

ROBERT E. FREELEN

First, there is a process, in which duly appointed stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni participate, for evaluating
the performance with respect to South Africa of corpora
tions in which Stanford is a shareholder. The Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR) is conscientiously en
gaged in that process; although it moves more slowly than
many would prefer, it is our belief that a case-by-case
analysis is the only fair way to decide whether Stanford
should continue its relationship with a particular corpora
tion. To aid in the analysis, the University has provided
additional resources to support the work of the CI Rand
the Treasurer's Office. We continue to require that com
panies must adopt the Sullivan Principles, including the
Fourth Amplification, which requires corporations to op
pose the apartheid laws, or perform in an equivalent way,
in order to be included in the Stanford portfolio.
Those who advocate "blanket divestment" believe that
doing business in South Africa is prima facie evidence of
"substantial social injury" — the ClR's criterion. Our
view is somewhat different: it is that the presumption of
such injury may be rebutted by corporate efforts both in
and outside the workplace. We believe that fairness re
quires us to examine that balance in each case.
The proponents of blanket divestment often argue that
disassociation from firms doing business in South Africa is
required in order to demonstrate our moral revulsion
against apartheid; thus the pro-divestment movement
often calls itself the anti-apartheid movement, as though a

conviction in the latter domain compelled the former pos
ition as well. But there are a variety of channels into which
disapproval of apartheid can be directed. There are efforts
to work with other universities, foundations, corporations
and elected officials to provide educational, medical and
other sorts of help to the oppressed in South Africa. There
are ways to influence policy with respect to South Africa
— including, but not limited to, legislative initiatives to in
crease the power of U.S. economic sanctions against the
Afrikaaner government. There are, finally, efforts to in
duce corporations to increase their pressure against that
government to change the laws that uphold the institution
of apartheid. Administrators, students and faculty at this
University have all been at work, in various ways, on each
of these alternatives.

Blanket divestment will not
change the character of the
problems in South Africa; it
will only make them appear
more distant.

Stereotyping companies that derive 1 or 2 percent
of their sales from South Africa as unworthy (regardless of
their actions toward ending apartheid) is itself an act of
prejudice. That the evaluation of individual performance
is difficult, time-consuming and subject to error is no ex
cuse for blanket stereotyping. That principle is important
to us in other contexts, and it must be conserved.
Blanket divestment will not change the character of the
problems in South Africa; it will only make them appear
more distant, and give us a kind of comfort we should not
want and do not deserve. And it will do so on a basis that
is undiscriminating and unfair to corporations that have a
wide range of levels of social responsibility. It Is always
difficult to opt for the slow and patient course when there
is a clear alternative that seems to possess the qualities of
a moral imperative: but that is exactly the kind of choice
the voters have on this referendum question. As in so
many other complex matters, the short solution is not the
best solution.

rials is to strip the process of its essential claim to validity.
Without supposing that the following statement will
provide an adequate substitute for ballot arguments, we
nevertheless want to summarize some of the reasons for
opposing blanket divestment. These were discussed, often
at considerable length, during the events of last spring: but
many members of the community were not here then, or
were focused on other matters.

First, there is a process, in which duly appointed stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni participate, for evaluating
the performance with respect to South Africa of corpora
tions in which Stanford is a shareholder. The Committee
on Investment Responsibility (CIR) is conscientiously en
gaged in that process; although it moves more slowly than
many would prefer, it is our belief that a case-by-case
analysis is the only fair way to decide whether Stanford
should continue its relationship with a particular corpora
tion. To aid in the analysis, the University has provided
additional resources to support the work of the CI Rand
the Treasurer's Office. We continue to require that com
panies must adopt the Sullivan Principles, including the
Fourth Amplification, which requires corporations to op
pose the apartheid laws, or perform in an equivalent way,
in order to be included in the Stanford portfolio.
Those who advocate "blanket divestment" believe that
doing business in South Africa is prima facie evidence of
"substantial social injury" — the ClR's criterion. Our
view is somewhat different: it is that the presumption of
such injury may be rebutted by corporate efforts both in
and outside the workplace. We believe that fairness re
quires us to examine that balance in each case.
The proponents of blanket divestment often argue that
disassociation from firms doing business in South Africa is
required in order to demonstrate our moral revulsion
against apartheid; thus the pro-divestment movement
often calls itself the anti-apartheid movement, as though a

conviction in the latter domain compelled the former pos
ition as well. But there are a variety of channels into which
disapproval of apartheid can be directed. There are efforts
to work with other universities, foundations, corporations
and elected officials to provide educational, medical and
other sorts of help to the oppressed in South Africa. There
are ways to influence policy with respect to South Africa
— including, but not limited to, legislative initiatives to in
crease the power of U.S. economic sanctions against the
Afrikaaner government. There are, finally, efforts to in
duce corporations to increase their pressure against that
government to change the laws that uphold the institution
of apartheid. Administrators, students and faculty at this
University have all been at work, in various ways, on each
of these alternatives.

Blanket divestment will not
change the character of the
problems in South Africa; it
will only make them appear
more distant.

Stereotyping companies that derive 1 or 2 percent
of their sales from South Africa as unworthy (regardless of
their actions toward ending apartheid) is itself an act of
prejudice. That the evaluation of individual performance
is difficult, time-consuming and subject to error is no ex
cuse for blanket stereotyping. That principle is important
to us in other contexts, and it must be conserved.
Blanket divestment will not change the character of the
problems in South Africa; it will only make them appear
more distant, and give us a kind of comfort we should not
want and do not deserve. And it will do so on a basis that
is undiscriminating and unfair to corporations that have a
wide range of levels of social responsibility. It Is always
difficult to opt for the slow and patient course when there
is a clear alternative that seems to possess the qualities of
a moral imperative: but that is exactly the kind of choice
the voters have on this referendum question. As in so
many other complex matters, the short solution is not the
best solution.
