# Millions owed in tickets
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Stanford students have run up a tab
of $2.7 million in unpaid parking tic
kets since 1980, but no one seems io
know quite how to go about collecting
any of it.
Suggestions range from towing the
vehicles of repeat offenders to placing
a hold on their academic registration.
Parking violations are the govern
ment's business, not the school's,
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington told the San Francisco
Chronicle last week.
"Students (who fail to pay the
fines) are breaking the law on Stan
ford property. That's Stanford's busi
ness," Santa Clara County Depart
ment of Revtnue iieau Bob McGrath
said yesterday.
Although Stanford police issue the
citations for campus parking viola
tions, the fines are paid to the De
partment of Revenue. Those who do
not pay may have their vehicle regist
ration placed on "hold" at the De
partment of Motor Vehicles (DMV),
meaning the registration cannot be
renewed, but the county can do little
else. The result of lax penalties has
been a buildup of 86,000 unpaid
parking tickets since 1980, most of
them belonging to repeat offenders.
McGrath explained that many
scofflaws are non-California residents
who avoid paying parking fines by
returning to their home states, leaving
the county powerless to collect.
"1 hesitate to have you publish it,
but there's nothing set up between
the DMV and other states [to collect
the fines]," McGrath said, adding that
there would probably be no change in
the present system.
"It's too complicated," he said.
County Supervisor Dianne
McKenna, who intends to meet with
University representatives in the near
future to discuss the matter, said yes
terday that she is looking for a
"win-win" solution to the problem of
collecting the revenue.
"The county is suffering a deficit,
so they want the money. Stanford
wants the money to pay for the
people (who issue the citations) . . .
whatever (solution) the county came
up with would have to be mutually
agreed upon," McKenna said.
She had no specific comments re
garding suggestions by some county
officials that offering Stanford a share
of the revenue would lead to more
effective collection efforts.
"1 have not talked to Stanford yet,"
McKenna said. "We have to talk to
county staff before we test the waters
at the University."
Herrington is quoted in the April
11 Chronicle as stating that the "ul
timate solution'" to the problem
would be to toughen laws which allow
campus police to tow cars with five or
more outstanding tickets. He
criticized another proposed solution
— requiring students to pay their fines before
being allowed to register — as being "illegal."
McGrath, however, insisted that linking
academics to parking fines could prove effective
at Stanford.
"As far as I know, it's not illegal. Some
schools in Southern California are doing it al
ready," McGrath said.
