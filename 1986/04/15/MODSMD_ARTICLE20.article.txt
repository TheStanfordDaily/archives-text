## Union-ited we stand, and other random thoughts 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Bug Me mailbag:
Last week I ran a question about the ab
sence of a book detection system at Green
Library. The questioner, "Anonymous," re
ferred in his inquiry to "crabby human
backpack inspectors" and implied the desira
bility of eliminating the same. This week I re
ceived a rebuttal from R.T. Carr 111, one of
the backpack inspectors at Green. It's quite
an eloquent letter and, I think, makes a very
good point, so I'd like to present a portion of
it here:
Leave it to some person to malign the re
spected name of" Anonymous." This respected
author of hooks, plays and music is spinning in
his hallowed tomb at the misuse and misap
propriation of his name!
How could any user of the library consider
us portal monitors as unneeded? Woidd any
purpose be served by "eliminating the crabby
human backpack inspectors"?
Point by point....
1) I can speak for myself here. I have yet to
see a "crabby" portal monitor. Cheerful
people are attracted to this heavy public contact
job. I personally have seen many folks who are
amazed portal monitors keep the good humor
they possess as a genre.
2) Thank you, Anonymous, for the accolade
"human." I accept it gladly.
3) "Backpack examiners" was flippantly
mischaracterized. My function, as I see it, is to
protect our fine collection for its users (stu

dents, faculty). When the alarm goes off at
Meyer, one still has to be checked, so what's
the problem?
On the ot!\er side, we act as "Information,
please" to visitors, parents and the many fine
guests who pilgrimage here to see Stanford and
its fine facilities.
. . . whatever happens, this portal monitor
will be on the job and doing the best he can,
too. And I'll even help you, dear Anonymous,
if you give me a chance.
A good point, well made. As a footnote, I
also dislike it when people sign " Anonymous"
to their questions. The least you could do is
make up a clever pseudonym. Anyway, on
with the column.
Dear Bug Me,
Why is the Old Union called "Old Union,"
while the new union is called " Tresidder
Union"? Is it because when they built the old
union no good profs had died yet? What was
the old union called before there was a new
union? Did it used to have a bowling alley,
too?
-John Dougherty
Hmmmm ... and why is Stanford's motto
in German when everything else on campus
(including the architecture) is Spanish?
You see, "tresidder" is actually a Spanish
word for "new." And that explains the whole
thing.
Not really. What this question calls for,
basically, is a history of the student union at
Stanford. Here it goes:
According to Orrin Elliott's book, "Stan

ford University: The First 25 Years," Stan
ford didn't really have any student union until
quite a few years after its founding in 1891.
The first approximation of a student union —
in the form of a men's clubhouse — was prop
osed in 1909 by the omnipresent Herbert
Hoover, Class of 1895.
At about the same time, a similar building
for women was proposed. And in 1912,
Hoover put forward the suggestion that both
clubhouses be built on the same site. Con
struction began in December 1913 and
finished in February 1915.

What is now the Clubhouse was then the
Women's Clubhouse, and what is now the
Nitery and Graduate Studies Office was then
the Men's Clubhouse. The Men's Clubhouse
was more commonly called the "Stanford
Union." Given that Hoover provided both the
financial and planning impetus for the project,
it might have been logical to name the new
union after him. However, he was neither
dead nor, probably, desirous of the commem
oration. Besides, some visionary must have
realized that Hoover's name needed to be

saved for bigger (or at least taller) things.
The actual Stanford union (the building
which now contains Admissions, Financial
Aids, the Bursar and all those other fun
places) was built in 1922. It was originally a
women's dormitory. By that time, the Univer
sity's first president, David Starr Jordan, had
had part of the Quad named after him and the
school's second chief, John Casper Branner,
was soon to have his name attached to a new
dorm (completed in 1924). With no past
presidents remaining to take names from, it
seems only appropriate that the original name
of the Men's Clubhouse should be assigned to
the whole complex of the two clubhouses and
the new residence, once they were all com
pleted and attached.
In 1962, a new student union was built. At
that point, another dorm had already been
named after Stanford's third president, Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and so the new student union
was logically given the name of the fourth
president, Donald Bertrand Tresidder.
"Tresidder Memorial Union" shortens
nicely to "Tresidder" (I think it's a pretty cool
name myself), whereas shortening Stanford
Union to "Stanford" might have caused some
confusion. (Then people would start calling
the Stanford Bookstore and Stanford Memo
rial Church "Stanford," too.) So, what is now
the Old Union used to be called "Union
Hall," or just "the Union." The word "old"
really has two meanings, one being "aged," or
"not young," and the other being "erstwhile"
or "former." In the case of the Old Union,
both meanings apply, and so it's a very fitting

name.
Someday, another new union will be built,
and then we'll have "Old Tresidder" and
"Very Old Union."
Dear Bug Me,
What is the fate of the howling trophy case in
LOTS II?
- Quasimodo
I first talked to Cheryl St. Clair, manager of
the recreation center at Tresidder. She told
me that the issue of the trophy case hadn't re
ally been discussed, but that it would probably
remain where it is until the planned renova
tion of Tresidder takes place (in a year or so).
She also told me that a lot of the trophies be
long to individuals who are ready to claim
them should the case be removed.
There are also a few team trophies, ac
cording to St. Clair. "I imagine there will be a
place for those, but I'm not sure where," she
said.
There is still a Stanford bowling team (it's a
club sport), which now bowls off campus. The
team is inactive this year, but will resume play
next year.
I talked to the team's coach, Warren
Newell, who said that the team certainly "has
some sentimental attachment" to the
trophies. Newell hopes that some other place
can be found for them, and suggested upstairs
at Tresidder.
My final calls were to several people in the
Athletic Department. Judging from the way
they blew me off, I don't think they have
much interest in the trophy case.

osed in 1909 by the omnipresent Herbert
Hoover, Class of 1895.
At about the same time, a similar building
for women was proposed. And in 1912,
Hoover put forward the suggestion that both
clubhouses be built on the same site. Con
struction began in December 1913 and
finished in February 1915.

What is now the Clubhouse was then the
Women's Clubhouse, and what is now the
Nitery and Graduate Studies Office was then
the Men's Clubhouse. The Men's Clubhouse
was more commonly called the "Stanford
Union." Given that Hoover provided both the
financial and planning impetus for the project,
it might have been logical to name the new
union after him. However, he was neither
dead nor, probably, desirous of the commem
oration. Besides, some visionary must have
realized that Hoover's name needed to be

saved for bigger (or at least taller) things.
The actual Stanford union (the building
which now contains Admissions, Financial
Aids, the Bursar and all those other fun
places) was built in 1922. It was originally a
women's dormitory. By that time, the Univer
sity's first president, David Starr Jordan, had
had part of the Quad named after him and the
school's second chief, John Casper Branner,
was soon to have his name attached to a new
dorm (completed in 1924). With no past
presidents remaining to take names from, it
seems only appropriate that the original name
of the Men's Clubhouse should be assigned to
the whole complex of the two clubhouses and
the new residence, once they were all com
pleted and attached.
In 1962, a new student union was built. At
that point, another dorm had already been
named after Stanford's third president, Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and so the new student union
was logically given the name of the fourth
president, Donald Bertrand Tresidder.
"Tresidder Memorial Union" shortens
nicely to "Tresidder" (I think it's a pretty cool
name myself), whereas shortening Stanford
Union to "Stanford" might have caused some
confusion. (Then people would start calling
the Stanford Bookstore and Stanford Memo
rial Church "Stanford," too.) So, what is now
the Old Union used to be called "Union
Hall," or just "the Union." The word "old"
really has two meanings, one being "aged," or
"not young," and the other being "erstwhile"
or "former." In the case of the Old Union,
both meanings apply, and so it's a very fitting

name.
Someday, another new union will be built,
and then we'll have "Old Tresidder" and
"Very Old Union."
Dear Bug Me,
What is the fate of the howling trophy case in
LOTS II?
- Quasimodo
I first talked to Cheryl St. Clair, manager of
the recreation center at Tresidder. She told
me that the issue of the trophy case hadn't re
ally been discussed, but that it would probably
remain where it is until the planned renova
tion of Tresidder takes place (in a year or so).
She also told me that a lot of the trophies be
long to individuals who are ready to claim
them should the case be removed.
There are also a few team trophies, ac
cording to St. Clair. "I imagine there will be a
place for those, but I'm not sure where," she
said.
There is still a Stanford bowling team (it's a
club sport), which now bowls off campus. The
team is inactive this year, but will resume play
next year.
I talked to the team's coach, Warren
Newell, who said that the team certainly "has
some sentimental attachment" to the
trophies. Newell hopes that some other place
can be found for them, and suggested upstairs
at Tresidder.
My final calls were to several people in the
Athletic Department. Judging from the way
they blew me off, I don't think they have
much interest in the trophy case.

Last week I ran a question about the ab
sence of a book detection system at Green
Library. The questioner, "Anonymous," re
ferred in his inquiry to "crabby human
backpack inspectors" and implied the desira
bility of eliminating the same. This week I re
ceived a rebuttal from R.T. Carr 111, one of
the backpack inspectors at Green. It's quite
an eloquent letter and, I think, makes a very
good point, so I'd like to present a portion of
it here:
Leave it to some person to malign the re
spected name of" Anonymous." This respected
author of hooks, plays and music is spinning in
his hallowed tomb at the misuse and misap
propriation of his name!
How could any user of the library consider
us portal monitors as unneeded? Woidd any
purpose be served by "eliminating the crabby
human backpack inspectors"?
Point by point....
1) I can speak for myself here. I have yet to
see a "crabby" portal monitor. Cheerful
people are attracted to this heavy public contact
job. I personally have seen many folks who are
amazed portal monitors keep the good humor
they possess as a genre.
2) Thank you, Anonymous, for the accolade
"human." I accept it gladly.
3) "Backpack examiners" was flippantly
mischaracterized. My function, as I see it, is to
protect our fine collection for its users (stu

dents, faculty). When the alarm goes off at
Meyer, one still has to be checked, so what's
the problem?
On the ot!\er side, we act as "Information,
please" to visitors, parents and the many fine
guests who pilgrimage here to see Stanford and
its fine facilities.
. . . whatever happens, this portal monitor
will be on the job and doing the best he can,
too. And I'll even help you, dear Anonymous,
if you give me a chance.
A good point, well made. As a footnote, I
also dislike it when people sign " Anonymous"
to their questions. The least you could do is
make up a clever pseudonym. Anyway, on
with the column.
Dear Bug Me,
Why is the Old Union called "Old Union,"
while the new union is called " Tresidder
Union"? Is it because when they built the old
union no good profs had died yet? What was
the old union called before there was a new
union? Did it used to have a bowling alley,
too?
-John Dougherty
Hmmmm ... and why is Stanford's motto
in German when everything else on campus
(including the architecture) is Spanish?
You see, "tresidder" is actually a Spanish
word for "new." And that explains the whole
thing.
Not really. What this question calls for,
basically, is a history of the student union at
Stanford. Here it goes:
According to Orrin Elliott's book, "Stan

ford University: The First 25 Years," Stan
ford didn't really have any student union until
quite a few years after its founding in 1891.
The first approximation of a student union —
in the form of a men's clubhouse — was prop
