## Credit where credit is due New-found friends offer new credit card opportunities 
### KEN SAWYER Editorial staff 
I've become a very popular person lately.
Friends I never knew I had are appearing left
and right. My post office box is never empty
and my "friends" are begging me to write to
them.
Although the letters I receive are neither
perfumed nor personally signed, they are let
ters nonetheless. How did I become the lucky
recipient of so many literary expressions of
goodwill?
I read magazines and receive student-rate
subscriptions. You see, the magazine sub
scription service from which I order my
periodicals sells my name and address to
soon-to-be friends of mine like Vernon Ken
ney (I'll tell you about Vernon later).
I thought I was getting a great deal when I
ordered my magazines through this student
discount service. I had no idea that as an extra
bonus I would also get a bunch of new-found
friends who were going to do a number of
great things for me.
But before I go on, let me tell you a little bit
about my "friends." They are all marketing
managers for credit card firms, and all offer
me great opportunities to establish a credit
rating, buy neat things their stores sell and
look like a big shot when I pull out my wallet
containing 50 credit cards.
Let's peek inside my first bit of mail: "My
name is Vernon Kenney, you don't know me
but I have two surprises for you. As vice
president of credit for Montgomery Ward I
have good news." (I got a little excited here as
I fantasized that a possible summer job offer
was going to be extended or that I had won a
contest of some sort.)
"First, you've been selected to receive this
limited offer for a Montgomery Ward credit
card (gosh, what good news!). . . . The second
surprise is the new shopping world of
Montgomery Ward has more brand name
merchandise than ever (truly surprising)."
Richard Skagen extended an invitation to
me on behalf of Sears. Dick writes, "Sears is
pleased to invite you to apply for a Sears cre
dit card." Dick adds, "On the day you
graduate, you may find it hard to establish a
good credit rating." I don't think he knows
that Vernon doesn't care if I have a credit
rating or not. Dick didn't mention the brand
name merchandise that Sears sells; perhaps he
figured that I wasn't much interested in
Cheryl Tiegs jeans.

Ed Cassady writes that "Shell would like to
establish a business relationship with you." I
guess Ed doesn't want to be my friend, just
sell me his gasoline. He explains that "a Shell
credit card has been reserved for you." I al
ways thought one had to call for a reservation;
I'm just glad Ed doesn't run a restaurant.
I think you understand my friends now, but
if you're like me you probably don't really

understand what you should do about these
offers. Probably you'll throw them in the
trash, but was about credit ratings? The truth
is that having one or two credit cards can be a
good thing for your credit rating, but that
having six or more might jeopardize your cre
dit rating.
Having a large number of credit cards can
send a signal to a bank telling them that you
need all these credit cards because you are
"cash-poor" and need to borrow as much

money aspossible. Also, if you have 12 credit
cards and receive 12 monthly bills which you
don't pay until the last minute, there is a good
chance (if you're at all like me) that you'll
forget to pay one or two and your credit rating
will turn sour overnight. Additionally, if you
lose your wallet you'll be on the phone all day
trying to call all the stores and cancel your
cards.

Hence, I recommend that you toss most of
the credit card solicitations in the trash and
search for a credit card on your own. Obvi
ously Mastercard, Visa and American Express
are the big names, and you can't go wrong
with one of these. However, more important
than the credit card itself is the bank that is
sues it.
One Visa may look like another, but it un
doubtedly is not. Annual fees on Visa cards
vary from nothing to $25, and annual interest

rates vary from 12.5 percent to 19.8 percent.
Also, and perhaps more importantly, the
perks each bank offers vary greatly.
First National Bank of Boston and Mary
land Bank of Delaware are two banks that
offer a toll-free message service at no extra
charge when you buy a Mastercard or Visa
from them. With this service, you can leave or
receive messages at no charge by calling an

800 number. Friends or relatives can also call
the number and leave messages for you.
First National Bank of Chicago and
Citicorp offer automatic 10 percent disconts
on rental cars if you pay for the car with their
credit card. Chemical Bank and Manufactur
ers Hanover Trust, as well as many other
banks, allow credit card holders to write
checks against their card account. The main
advantage is that the checks are accepted at
many stores that do not accept credit cards.

Chase Manhattan Bank, Maryland Bank of
Delaware and Chemical Bank are three in
stitutions that register and insure'all your cre
dit cards against loss or theft. If you lose your
cards the bank will automatically cancel all
your cards and insure that you are not respon
sible for fraudulent use of the credit cards.
Other banks allow emergency cash ad
vances. If you need cash you can call an 800
number and the bank will make arrangements
for you to get cash from a Western Union of
fice or from a local bank. Almost all banks
offer free travel life insurance ranging from
$100,000 to $650,000.
For an additional $25, many banks will en
roll credit card customers in a toll-free dis
count shopping service. Through this service,
customers can order flowers, clothes, cars, etc.
at as much as 50 percent below list price.
Bank America encourages credit card hol
ders to invest an additional $33 in
TripAmerica travel service, which offer dis
counts on vacations. For example, you can get
two free days in Lake Tahoe or Disney World
with a rental c*r when you have accumulated
$3,000 in airline ticket purchases.
Bank America also offers (for $98) a ser
vice through which you can receive free unli
mited legal advice by phone. Also, the lawyers
will draft legal documents such as real estate
contracts and leases at no charge.
Clearly, there is a plethora of choices and
options. Of course, in addition to the variety
of Mastercard and Visa cards, there are also a
number of other cards with additional
bonuses. Diners Club, Carte Blanche and the
new Discovery card from Sears are just a few
cards you might consider.
My advice about credit cards is simple: get a
Mastercard or Visa card that has no annual
fee (for a list of banks that issue no-fee cards,
write Bankcard Holders of America, 333
Pennsylvania Ave. S.E., Washington, D.C.
20003 â€” it costs $1.95).
The interest rates that these banks charge is
probably a little higher than average. How
ever, if you pay your bill in full when it arrives
(as do about one-third of Americans) you
won't need to worry about interest rates.
There is one caveat, however. When
choosing a card, check and find out whether
the bank provides a grace period after you
make a purchase before charging interest.
Approximately one-fourth of all banks charge
interest on the purchase date rather than on
the date your bill comes due.

Richard Skagen extended an invitation to
me on behalf of Sears. Dick writes, "Sears is
pleased to invite you to apply for a Sears cre
dit card." Dick adds, "On the day you
graduate, you may find it hard to establish a
good credit rating." I don't think he knows
that Vernon doesn't care if I have a credit
rating or not. Dick didn't mention the brand
name merchandise that Sears sells; perhaps he
figured that I wasn't much interested in
Cheryl Tiegs jeans.

Ed Cassady writes that "Shell would like to
establish a business relationship with you." I
guess Ed doesn't want to be my friend, just
sell me his gasoline. He explains that "a Shell
credit card has been reserved for you." I al
ways thought one had to call for a reservation;
I'm just glad Ed doesn't run a restaurant.
I think you understand my friends now, but
if you're like me you probably don't really

understand what you should do about these
offers. Probably you'll throw them in the
trash, but was about credit ratings? The truth
is that having one or two credit cards can be a
good thing for your credit rating, but that
having six or more might jeopardize your cre
dit rating.
Having a large number of credit cards can
send a signal to a bank telling them that you
need all these credit cards because you are
"cash-poor" and need to borrow as much

money aspossible. Also, if you have 12 credit
cards and receive 12 monthly bills which you
don't pay until the last minute, there is a good
chance (if you're at all like me) that you'll
forget to pay one or two and your credit rating
will turn sour overnight. Additionally, if you
lose your wallet you'll be on the phone all day
trying to call all the stores and cancel your
cards.

Hence, I recommend that you toss most of
the credit card solicitations in the trash and
search for a credit card on your own. Obvi
ously Mastercard, Visa and American Express
are the big names, and you can't go wrong
with one of these. However, more important
than the credit card itself is the bank that is
sues it.
One Visa may look like another, but it un
doubtedly is not. Annual fees on Visa cards
vary from nothing to $25, and annual interest

rates vary from 12.5 percent to 19.8 percent.
Also, and perhaps more importantly, the
perks each bank offers vary greatly.
First National Bank of Boston and Mary
land Bank of Delaware are two banks that
offer a toll-free message service at no extra
charge when you buy a Mastercard or Visa
from them. With this service, you can leave or
receive messages at no charge by calling an

800 number. Friends or relatives can also call
the number and leave messages for you.
First National Bank of Chicago and
Citicorp offer automatic 10 percent disconts
on rental cars if you pay for the car with their
credit card. Chemical Bank and Manufactur
ers Hanover Trust, as well as many other
banks, allow credit card holders to write
checks against their card account. The main
advantage is that the checks are accepted at
many stores that do not accept credit cards.

Chase Manhattan Bank, Maryland Bank of
Delaware and Chemical Bank are three in
stitutions that register and insure'all your cre
dit cards against loss or theft. If you lose your
cards the bank will automatically cancel all
your cards and insure that you are not respon
sible for fraudulent use of the credit cards.
Other banks allow emergency cash ad
vances. If you need cash you can call an 800
number and the bank will make arrangements
for you to get cash from a Western Union of
fice or from a local bank. Almost all banks
offer free travel life insurance ranging from
$100,000 to $650,000.
For an additional $25, many banks will en
roll credit card customers in a toll-free dis
count shopping service. Through this service,
customers can order flowers, clothes, cars, etc.
at as much as 50 percent below list price.
Bank America encourages credit card hol
ders to invest an additional $33 in
TripAmerica travel service, which offer dis
counts on vacations. For example, you can get
two free days in Lake Tahoe or Disney World
with a rental c*r when you have accumulated
$3,000 in airline ticket purchases.
Bank America also offers (for $98) a ser
vice through which you can receive free unli
mited legal advice by phone. Also, the lawyers
will draft legal documents such as real estate
contracts and leases at no charge.
Clearly, there is a plethora of choices and
options. Of course, in addition to the variety
of Mastercard and Visa cards, there are also a
number of other cards with additional
bonuses. Diners Club, Carte Blanche and the
new Discovery card from Sears are just a few
cards you might consider.
My advice about credit cards is simple: get a
Mastercard or Visa card that has no annual
fee (for a list of banks that issue no-fee cards,
write Bankcard Holders of America, 333
Pennsylvania Ave. S.E., Washington, D.C.
20003 â€” it costs $1.95).
The interest rates that these banks charge is
probably a little higher than average. How
ever, if you pay your bill in full when it arrives
(as do about one-third of Americans) you
won't need to worry about interest rates.
There is one caveat, however. When
choosing a card, check and find out whether
the bank provides a grace period after you
make a purchase before charging interest.
Approximately one-fourth of all banks charge
interest on the purchase date rather than on
the date your bill comes due.

I've become a very popular person lately.
Friends I never knew I had are appearing left
and right. My post office box is never empty
and my "friends" are begging me to write to
them.
Although the letters I receive are neither
perfumed nor personally signed, they are let
ters nonetheless. How did I become the lucky
recipient of so many literary expressions of
goodwill?
I read magazines and receive student-rate
subscriptions. You see, the magazine sub
scription service from which I order my
periodicals sells my name and address to
soon-to-be friends of mine like Vernon Ken
ney (I'll tell you about Vernon later).
I thought I was getting a great deal when I
ordered my magazines through this student
discount service. I had no idea that as an extra
bonus I would also get a bunch of new-found
friends who were going to do a number of
great things for me.
But before I go on, let me tell you a little bit
about my "friends." They are all marketing
managers for credit card firms, and all offer
me great opportunities to establish a credit
rating, buy neat things their stores sell and
look like a big shot when I pull out my wallet
containing 50 credit cards.
Let's peek inside my first bit of mail: "My
name is Vernon Kenney, you don't know me
but I have two surprises for you. As vice
president of credit for Montgomery Ward I
have good news." (I got a little excited here as
I fantasized that a possible summer job offer
was going to be extended or that I had won a
contest of some sort.)
"First, you've been selected to receive this
limited offer for a Montgomery Ward credit
card (gosh, what good news!). . . . The second
surprise is the new shopping world of
Montgomery Ward has more brand name
merchandise than ever (truly surprising)."
