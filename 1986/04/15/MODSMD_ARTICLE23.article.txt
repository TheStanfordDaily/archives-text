## British film takes lingering look at ethnicity 'Laundrette' is a confection worth catching 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"My Beautiful Laundrette," a
bright, new social comedy from Eng
land, sparkles, especially when set be
side the mostly moldy offerings of this
spring's crop of movies. Its shine
comes not just from an enormously
appealing cast of characters, or from
terrific dialogue, but from the entire
socio-political milieu it spins to
gether. The movie is a delicious con
fection, with a plethora of surprising
ingredients: it's impossible (and un
desirable) to separate the ingredients,
peg them in neat little categories and
then pin a label on the whole mixture.
The setting is modern South Lon
don, where a family of Pakistanis is
thriving in a variety of businesses —
some legitimate, some not. This is, of
course, Thatcher's England, where
hard work and shrewd enterprise are
the key to success (at least according
to some of the characters). Young
Omar (Gordon Warnecke), the son of
a bed-ridden, left-wing intellectual
(Roshan Seth), is ready to succeed.
His cheerfully entrepreneurial uncle,
Nassar (Saeed Jaffrey), is ready to
help him, and gets him started wash
ing cars in his parking garage. Soon
Omar, through hard work, but mostly
through shrewd enterprise, has
graduated to running his uncle's
bombed-out laundrette, which he
transforms with help from his friend
and lover, Johnny (Daniel Day
Lewis), and unwitting help from a
drug-dealing uncle, Salim (Derrick
Branche).
The movie was made for British
television, but you'd never know it
from the complexity of the characters
and their relationships, of from the
day-glo brightness and depth of the
photography (by Oliver Stapleton).
The harsh luster of the images sets the
tone for the movie, which, much like
the characters themselves, is brash
and confident. Part of what's so ex
citing about "My Beautiful Laun
drette" is the exuberant liveliness of

its characters — principally the
Pakistanis, or "Pakis," as they're cal
led by the roaming white trash who
cruise the desolate neighborhoods.
Nassar and his extended family, who
hold gatherings at his London man
sion, have a variety of shady busines
ses, and they revel in their prosperity.
Nassar, who's at the center of the
family, is a grand sensualist; he has a
white mistress (Shirley Anne Field),
and he's happy when she flirts openly

with Omar. He also loves his family,
and is just as happy when his rebel
daughter, Tania (Rita Wolf), also
goes after Omar. Nassar embodies
what he feels is the promise of Eng
land; here, he says, one can make lots
of money. For Nassar money, sex and
happiness are inseparable.
Omar's father is the flip side of the
ideological coin; he was a leading
socialist intellectual in Pakistan, but
in London he's a vodka-sotten wash
out, unable to attend to even his bod
ily functions. His mind is still sharp.

though, and when he and Nassar talk
near the end of the movie, they
lucidly discuss the strengths and pit
falls of their respective beliefs. In fact,
the characters in this movie spend
much time discussing their socio
politics. But they're never just push
ing around a series of position papers;
these people grab onto their beliefs
and turn them into designs for living.
Besides the Pakistanis, the other
"family" we see is the community of

white street punks, who are aimless,
anarchist casualties of Thatcher's En
gland. They hate the Pakis for their
color and for their success; they be
lieve the Pakis were brought to Eng
land to serve the white population,
and they become confused and em
bittered when one of their own,
Johnny, goes willingly to work for
Nassar and Omar. The scriptwriter,
Hanif Kureishi, sets up his not-so
obvious conflicts, and then goes de
eper to show us the underside of the
love-hate relationships. Omar, in ad

dition to his love for Johnny, also
enjoys the idea of a white boy work
ing for him, particularly since Johnny
and his gang had previous run-ins
with his family when Omar was in
school (this partly led to the suicide of
Omar's mother). And when Johnny
shows up at Nassar's home, he's
ultra-conscious of how out of place he
is, and doesn't know quite how to be
have: the family's reaction to him is
one of amused contempt.

Johnny is torn between his loyalty
to his street chums — his roots — and
his realization that he's doomed if he
continues with them. He's intelligent
enough to realize that Omar and his
family are his ticket out of the street,
but he also understands that he'll
never completely fit in with their
community. (Tania understands this
too, which is why she comes to like
him much more than she likes Omar.)
His precarious position has made him
a little shell-shocked and wary, and
his relationship with Omar has a hint

of desperation. Lewis is completely
authentic in this role: his street punk
with reserves of intelligence and
kindness could be a cliche or a vac
uum, but Lewis' uncanny awareness
makes it work. Near the end, when
Salim is being attacked by the white
punks, Johnny is forced to make a
choice; this moment is the most dis
turbing in the movie, because Lewis
makes us feel and understand the har
rowing implications of his decision.

Omar's smiling, shrewd oppor
tunism and position as a favorite
nephew shield him from having to
make a comparable decision. Omar
knows what he wants when he ap
proaches his uncle, and his uncle rec
ognizes much of himself in this wil
ling, unprepossessing young man with
the entrepreneurial gleam in his eye.
Omar is a model of flexible morality;
when he has to steal, he steals, and he
would probably sleep with any of the
characters if he thought that it would
help him succeed. Yet, perhaps be

cause of his freewheeling self
interest, Omar is an immensely like
able character; he's audacious when
he has to be, and Warnecke gives him
a sneaky effrontery that's positively
winning.
Director Stephen Frears soon has
his large, varied cast of characters and
ideas bouncing off one another like
careening billiard balls; at times, the
different levels of awareness, instinct
and desire recall Alan Rudolph's
"Choose Me." If the cutting were a
fraction less precise, or the movie a
little less full of great material, the is
sues raised would be like dead weight
on the screen. (Only in a few in
stances, chiefly involving Omar's
father, did I feel that this was the
case.) What Frears and Kureishi do
here is astonishing: They create the
sense of a whole community living
and thriving off of the South London
decay, and each aspect they reveal is a
surprising discovery. The issues grow
naturally out of the characters and
their interactions; they never seem
forced, even when the movie rushes
along to fit everything in (when you
think back on it, you're surprised at
how much is packed into this film).
I've called the movie a social com
edy, but even that's too restrictive a
definition. The social comedy is om
nipresent — Omar and Nassar man
age their tawdry little service shops in
natty business suits, Nassar hires
Johnny to evict a black poet from one
of his slummy apartments — but it
only adds to our sense of the larger is
sues. Peter Rainer of the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner referred to the
movie as a kind of pipsqueak "God
father," in which immigrants are
again seduced by the dark side of the
capitalist dream. I think he's right,
though, unlike Coppola, Frears and
Kureishi keep their mixture light and
frothy; they like these characters too
much to pass harsh judgments.
Johnny, Omar, Nassar and his family
are drive by urges — sexual, financial,
political — that are terribly human.
Who can pass judgment on those?
