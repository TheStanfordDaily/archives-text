# Mellencamp stages faith-renewing rock show
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
A couple of years ago, 1 would
never have admitted to liking John
Cougar.
Back then, listening to Cougar was
about as cool as listening to Wham! is
now. If you turned up the radio and
tapped you feet when "Jack and
Diane" came on. the guys next to you
in the Springsteen T-shirts would
look at each other, roll a package of
cigarettes out of their shirtsleeve and
slowly shake their heads. Cougar had
a reputation as a shameless imitator, a
Midwestern teenybopper star who
ripped off every American artist he
could find, plugged them into his Top
40 formula and sold records to junior
high kids. He seemed to be the kind
of guy who would have radio hits for a
couple of years, run out of things to
imitate and plummet out of sight.
That impression was dead wrong.
Since that time. Cougar has dropped
his manufactured name in favor of his
real one (Mellencamp) and hardened
his music into a sincere, surprisingly
moving brand of rock that is im
mediately identifiable as his own. In
his last two albums — "Uh-huh" and
"Scarecrow" — he has grown up into
a respectably "serious" artist who has
not forgotten that the primary reason
he is on stage is to play guitar and
have a good time with the people who
came to listen to him sing.
I'm a Cougar convert. Last Wed
nesday night. I joined a few thousand
other converts in the Oakland Col
iseum to see the first of his two Bay
Area shows, and found even more re
ason to like this short, long-haired

guy from the Indiana farm country.
He poured out two-and-a-half hours
of sheer rock 'n' roll energy, racing
around the stage, dancing with the
audience and the band and giving the
general impression that there was
nothing he would rather he doing that
night than playing tunes with all these
great people up here for all you great
people down there.

Cougar had a
reputation as a
shameless im
itator, a Midwest
ern teenybopper
star ....

He opened with the anthemic
"Small Town," the biggest hit off
"Scarecrow." and the crowd went
into a frenzy of cheering that rarely
let up until he closed by playing
"Under the Boardwalk" with the
house lights up. He stuck with
"Scarecrow" material almost exclu
sively for the first part of the concert,
playing them a little too cautiously at
first, perhaps, a little too close to the
vinyl. He started opening up the
throttle when he pulled an audience
member on stage to sing the chorus of
"Hand to Hold on To" with him. The

two guitarists, tentative at first, slowly
started turning up, and by the time
they hit the raucous "Authority
Song" and "Play Guitar" midway
through the second set, they were
cooking together furiously.
The rest of the nine-piece band — a
fiddle and two female singers joined
the guitarists, keyboards and drums
— picked up the pace as well. After
sending the older members of the au
dience (and there were a surprising
number of them) into a frenzy with an
impassioned "Pink Houses," they
came back to encore with an impres
sive set of 1960s covers, including an
incredible version of James Brown's
"Cold Sweat" and CCR's "Proud
Mary."
Cougar's imitative qualities were
there to a degree — some of his
monologues sounded pretty Boss-like
— but he carried every little stage
maneuver off with such sincerity that
it seemed like his own.
A large part of Mellencamp's ap
peal is that he is so likable. He can get
away with telling a long story about
how he wrote "Ain't Even Done with
the Night" for his first girlfriend and
playing simple high school songs like
"Hurt So Good" because he is able to
laugh at himself while he does it. He
knows when to take rock seriously —
he stopped the show at one point to
ask concert-goers to write their con
gressmen about the plight of the
American farmer — and when to
treat it as simple, good-time music.
Wednesday night, he mixed the two
elements perfectly; he left the audi
ence, this convert in particular, feel
ing good about the state of American
rock 'n' roll.

nesday night. I joined a few thousand
other converts in the Oakland Col
iseum to see the first of his two Bay
Area shows, and found even more re
ason to like this short, long-haired

guy from the Indiana farm country.
He poured out two-and-a-half hours
of sheer rock 'n' roll energy, racing
around the stage, dancing with the
audience and the band and giving the
general impression that there was
nothing he would rather he doing that
night than playing tunes with all these
great people up here for all you great
people down there.

Cougar had a
reputation as a
shameless im
itator, a Midwest
ern teenybopper
star ....

He opened with the anthemic
"Small Town," the biggest hit off
"Scarecrow." and the crowd went
into a frenzy of cheering that rarely
let up until he closed by playing
"Under the Boardwalk" with the
house lights up. He stuck with
"Scarecrow" material almost exclu
sively for the first part of the concert,
playing them a little too cautiously at
first, perhaps, a little too close to the
vinyl. He started opening up the
throttle when he pulled an audience
member on stage to sing the chorus of
"Hand to Hold on To" with him. The

two guitarists, tentative at first, slowly
started turning up, and by the time
they hit the raucous "Authority
Song" and "Play Guitar" midway
through the second set, they were
cooking together furiously.
The rest of the nine-piece band — a
fiddle and two female singers joined
the guitarists, keyboards and drums
— picked up the pace as well. After
sending the older members of the au
dience (and there were a surprising
number of them) into a frenzy with an
impassioned "Pink Houses," they
came back to encore with an impres
sive set of 1960s covers, including an
incredible version of James Brown's
"Cold Sweat" and CCR's "Proud
Mary."
Cougar's imitative qualities were
there to a degree — some of his
monologues sounded pretty Boss-like
— but he carried every little stage
maneuver off with such sincerity that
it seemed like his own.
A large part of Mellencamp's ap
peal is that he is so likable. He can get
away with telling a long story about
how he wrote "Ain't Even Done with
the Night" for his first girlfriend and
playing simple high school songs like
"Hurt So Good" because he is able to
laugh at himself while he does it. He
knows when to take rock seriously —
he stopped the show at one point to
ask concert-goers to write their con
gressmen about the plight of the
American farmer — and when to
treat it as simple, good-time music.
Wednesday night, he mixed the two
elements perfectly; he left the audi
ence, this convert in particular, feel
ing good about the state of American
rock 'n' roll.
