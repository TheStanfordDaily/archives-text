## Spartans look to break Card dominance 
### CHRIS MYERS 
The San Jose State Spartans are
like the neighborhood pipsqueak who
repeatedly gets beat up by the local
bully bui just keeps coming back for
more. In this case, the bully is the
seventh-ranked Stanford baseball
team, which has already pummeled
the Spartans five times this season.
In the last three seasons, Stanford
is 12-1 against San Jose State. The
last time the Spartans could manage a
victory over the Cardinal was Feb. 10,
1984.

• The Spartans come back for more
this afternoon, taking to the Sunken
Diamond field at 2:30 for their sixth
and final meeting of the season with
the Cardinal.
Today's game is the start of a long
homestand for Stanford. Any Cardi
nal fan who has missed the action so
far this year and is suffering from
withdrawal can undergo immersion
therapy this week, as the team plays
eight games in as many days. All but
the last game will be at Sunken
Diamond.
After meeting non-conference op
ponents San Jose State and the Uni
versity of the Pacific today and to
morrow, respectively, the Cardinal
will host Arizona State for a three
game series over the weekend and
then play a make-up doubleheader
against UCLA on Monday. Next

Tuesday the team will travel to
Fresno State.
After a three-game sweep of
California over the weekend, Stan
ford remains atop the Pacific 10
Southern Division, still tied with
UCLA. The Bruins pulled out their
own broom over the weekend,
sweeping three games from USC. The
Cardinal improved its Pac-10 record
to 11-5 with the weekend spree.
Today, Stanford looks to improve
on its 14-8 non-conference record.
The Cardinal has dropped its last two
non-league matchups, losing two
weeks ago to San Francisco State and
to Santa Clara last week.
Despite its season-long dominance
of the Spartans, Stanford can't look
past this afternoon's game, either.
"We've been burned too many
times in midweek (non-conference)
games," Stanford Asst. Coach Dean
Stotz said. "We're finally figuring out
that we're not invincible, that we
can't just show up against anybody."
San Jose State, 3-6 in the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association and 15-22
on the year, is coming off a 21-5
thrashing of No. 24 UC-Santa Bar
bara (which took two of three from
the Cardinal earlier this year). Take
away the five losses to Stanford and
the Spartans' season record is nearly
.500.
"They're obviously playing better
than earlier in the season," Stotz said.
But so is the Cardinal, which broke
out of an offensive rut with 42 hits
and 24 runs in the series with Cal.
With the insertion of smooth-fielding
freshman Ron Witmeyer into the
lineup at first base, Stanford also
seems to finally be shoring up an in
field which has been a trouble spot all
year.
"We're starting to swing the bat
better, and we're played a lot better
defense the last three weeks," Stotz
said.
Freshman right-hander Steve Chit
ren is the likely starter for Stanford
this afternoon. Chitren has struggled
in both of his last two outings, and
enter today's game with a 2-4 record
and a 5.04 earned run average. Stotz
said that the freshman's biggest pro
blem is his control.
"He just hasn't thrown enough
strikes," Stotz explained. "The hits or
his stuff aren't that bad, but he
couples the hits around a couple

walks, and that gets him in trouble."
Stanford will need strong perfor
mances from Chitren and all his
pitching companions over the next
week. With eight games in eight days,
the pitching staff will, in Stotz's
words, "get taxed."
It's probably all too appropriate
that the Cardinal begins its taxing
week with a game on April 15.
Hopefully, Stanford will continue to
withhold victories from its opponents.
Stanford students ought to declare

themselves exempt from studying and
take advantage of this excellent op
portunity to catch their league
leading team in action.
Card notes
The Cardinal has outrun its oppo
nents this season to the tune of 113
steals to 23. Catcher John Ramos has
13 thefts, which means that he has
stolen more than half as many bases
as opponents have stolen off him.
Walt Harris has singlehandedly sto

len more bases than Cardinal foes
with 24. Toi Cook and Ruben Amaro
are the most efficient thieves with
22-of-24 and 11 - of -12 steals, respec
tively. Even pitcher Kevin Kunkel has
played a part in the Stanford running
game, although he was thrown out on
his only attempted steal.
Jack McDowell continues to anchor
the Cardinal pitching staff. The
fireballing righthander is working on
a string of six complete games and
boasts a 9-2 record, 5-1 in Six-Pac

action. McDowell has a 2.14 ERA
and averages better than a strikeout
an inning.
Harris is on a hitting tear. The
leftfielder went 8-for-13 against Cal,
has a six-game hitting streak and
leads the team in hits with 50. He has
also gone errorless this year.
The Cardinal as a team feasted on
Cal pitching. Stanford garnered 42
hits in the weekend set with the Bears
to raise its team batting average to
.302.


Kym Boyman/Daily
Freshman Frank Carey is known primarily for his defensive skills, carried a lively bat lately. Carey is in the midst of a five-game hitting
having committed only one error in his last 11 games, but he has also streak in which he has gone 7-for-17 for a .412 average.

San Jose State, 3-6 in the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association and 15-22
on the year, is coming off a 21-5
thrashing of No. 24 UC-Santa Bar
bara (which took two of three from
the Cardinal earlier this year). Take
away the five losses to Stanford and
the Spartans' season record is nearly
.500.
"They're obviously playing better
than earlier in the season," Stotz said.
But so is the Cardinal, which broke
out of an offensive rut with 42 hits
and 24 runs in the series with Cal.
With the insertion of smooth-fielding
freshman Ron Witmeyer into the
lineup at first base, Stanford also
seems to finally be shoring up an in
field which has been a trouble spot all
year.
"We're starting to swing the bat
better, and we're played a lot better
defense the last three weeks," Stotz
said.
Freshman right-hander Steve Chit
ren is the likely starter for Stanford
this afternoon. Chitren has struggled
in both of his last two outings, and
enter today's game with a 2-4 record
and a 5.04 earned run average. Stotz
said that the freshman's biggest pro
blem is his control.
"He just hasn't thrown enough
strikes," Stotz explained. "The hits or
his stuff aren't that bad, but he
couples the hits around a couple

walks, and that gets him in trouble."
Stanford will need strong perfor
mances from Chitren and all his
pitching companions over the next
week. With eight games in eight days,
the pitching staff will, in Stotz's
words, "get taxed."
It's probably all too appropriate
that the Cardinal begins its taxing
week with a game on April 15.
Hopefully, Stanford will continue to
withhold victories from its opponents.
Stanford students ought to declare

themselves exempt from studying and
take advantage of this excellent op
portunity to catch their league
leading team in action.
Card notes
The Cardinal has outrun its oppo
nents this season to the tune of 113
steals to 23. Catcher John Ramos has
13 thefts, which means that he has
stolen more than half as many bases
as opponents have stolen off him.
Walt Harris has singlehandedly sto

len more bases than Cardinal foes
with 24. Toi Cook and Ruben Amaro
are the most efficient thieves with
22-of-24 and 11 - of -12 steals, respec
tively. Even pitcher Kevin Kunkel has
played a part in the Stanford running
game, although he was thrown out on
his only attempted steal.
Jack McDowell continues to anchor
the Cardinal pitching staff. The
fireballing righthander is working on
a string of six complete games and
boasts a 9-2 record, 5-1 in Six-Pac

action. McDowell has a 2.14 ERA
and averages better than a strikeout
an inning.
Harris is on a hitting tear. The
leftfielder went 8-for-13 against Cal,
has a six-game hitting streak and
leads the team in hits with 50. He has
also gone errorless this year.
The Cardinal as a team feasted on
Cal pitching. Stanford garnered 42
hits in the weekend set with the Bears
to raise its team batting average to
.302.

Freshman Frank Carey is known primarily for his defensive skills, carried a lively bat lately. Carey is in the midst of a five-game hitting
having committed only one error in his last 11 games, but he has also streak in which he has gone 7-for-17 for a .412 average.
The San Jose State Spartans are
like the neighborhood pipsqueak who
repeatedly gets beat up by the local
bully bui just keeps coming back for
more. In this case, the bully is the
seventh-ranked Stanford baseball
team, which has already pummeled
the Spartans five times this season.
In the last three seasons, Stanford
is 12-1 against San Jose State. The
last time the Spartans could manage a
victory over the Cardinal was Feb. 10,
1984.

• The Spartans come back for more
this afternoon, taking to the Sunken
Diamond field at 2:30 for their sixth
and final meeting of the season with
the Cardinal.
Today's game is the start of a long
homestand for Stanford. Any Cardi
nal fan who has missed the action so
far this year and is suffering from
withdrawal can undergo immersion
therapy this week, as the team plays
eight games in as many days. All but
the last game will be at Sunken
Diamond.
After meeting non-conference op
ponents San Jose State and the Uni
versity of the Pacific today and to
morrow, respectively, the Cardinal
will host Arizona State for a three
game series over the weekend and
then play a make-up doubleheader
against UCLA on Monday. Next

Tuesday the team will travel to
Fresno State.
After a three-game sweep of
California over the weekend, Stan
ford remains atop the Pacific 10
Southern Division, still tied with
UCLA. The Bruins pulled out their
own broom over the weekend,
sweeping three games from USC. The
Cardinal improved its Pac-10 record
to 11-5 with the weekend spree.
Today, Stanford looks to improve
on its 14-8 non-conference record.
The Cardinal has dropped its last two
non-league matchups, losing two
weeks ago to San Francisco State and
to Santa Clara last week.
Despite its season-long dominance
of the Spartans, Stanford can't look
past this afternoon's game, either.
"We've been burned too many
times in midweek (non-conference)
games," Stanford Asst. Coach Dean
Stotz said. "We're finally figuring out
