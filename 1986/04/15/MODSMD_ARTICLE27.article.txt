# Anteaters visit No. 6 Cardinal
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Stanford will try to avoid a sense of deja vu
today when it hosts UC-Irvine in a 1:30 p.m.
men's tennis match on the Varsity Courts.
Earlier this month, the sixth-ranked Car

dinal hosted 16th-ranked Long Beach State
on a Tuesday that preceded big weekend
matches with USC and UCLA. The 49ers
routed the Cardinal squad, which might
have been looking forward to playing its Los
Angeles rivals.
Well, today is a Tuesday, and Stanford is

hosting the 19th-ranked UC-lrvine Anteat
ers. And this weekend, the Cardinal travels
to L.A. for crucial matches against the Tro
jans and Bruins. See the parallels?
Don't fret too much, however, because
this isn't the same Stanford squad as before.
Since the Long Beach loss, the newly steeled
Cardinal has won four out of five Pac-10
matches, with the only loss coming at hands
of UCLA by a 5-4 score.
Still, Stanford Coach Dick Gould re
minded his players of their recent histoiy
yesterday at practice and warned against a
repeat performance.
"Long Beach State is a better team (than
Irvine), but look what happened last time we
were in this situation," he said.
Gould said he thinks that his team is now
playing better, and successive 8-1, 9-0 and
6-1 victories over California, Arizona and
Arizona State back up that feeling.
On the other side of the court, the An
teaters, who boast a record of 16-9, still har
bor an outside hope that they will get into
the NCAA tournament.
"The door is slamming shut on us," Irvine
Coach Greg Patton said yesterday. "So we
have to throw our whole body into it (to
day's match) to keep it from shutting. We
have two big matches left — Stanford and
USC — and if we can win those then we've
still got a shot."
Yesterday, the Anteaters raised their
Pacific Coast Athletic Conference to 4-1 by
defeating San Jose State 8-1. Surprisingly,
Irvine's lone loss came at the No. 1 singles
spot, which is inhabited by senior Bruce
Man Song Hing.
The 18th-ranked senior fell victim to San
Jose's Malcolm Allen by a 2-6, 6-4, 7-5
score.
"Bruce has been having a phenomenal
season for us," Patton said. "But what I
think happened (yesterday) was that he's
been playing so many of the top players in
the nation that he let down a bit and their
guy (Allen) was gunning for him."
Man Song Hing will have to look up on
the court today, as he will probably face
Stanford senior Dan Goldie, who is ranked
third in the country. Goldie has now won
three straight matches and has given up a
total of only 11 games in those victories.
"I'm hitting the ball well now," Goldie
said. "It's just a matter of whether I can
compete mentally on the court or not."
Stanford will have to compete tomorrow
without the services of senior Jim Grabb.
Grabb aggravated a pulled muscle over the
weekend and will be taking a rest.
Due to that injury. Cardinal sophomore
Patrick McEnroe will probably move into
the No. 2 position behind Goldie. The
44th-ranked McEnroe will be putting his
perfect 15-0 record on the line.
Over the weekend. McEnroe teamed with
senior John Letts to win both No. 1 doubles
matches in convincing fashion.
Rounding out the singles lineup for the
Cardinal will be seniors Letts and Eric
Rosenfeld and juniors Scott Moody and
Mark Jacobson.
