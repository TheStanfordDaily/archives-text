# Golfers in 11th place
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin knew that the
competition would be tough at the Lady Sun
Devil women's golf tournament in Phoenix,
Ariz., hut he had nevertheless counted on the
Cardinal to make an impressive showing.
Instead, Stanford finds itself not only tied for
11th place after the first round of the 54-hole
tournament on the par-72 Anasazi Golf Course,
but also the only one of the eight participating
national top-10 teams not in the first 10 in
Phoenix.
"Actually. I think we're a little frustrated."
Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy said. "We're all
just a little impatient."
McCarthy, however, is confident of the Car
dinal's chances going into the last 36 holes.
"I have a lot of faith in this team," she said. "I
don't worry about us. I know some good rounds
are in there. We're capable of shooting some
good numbers."
USC, whose men won the U.S. Intercollegiate
at Stanford yesterday, leads Oklahoma State by

one stroke, 300-301. The threesome of San Jose
State. Florida and UCLA is only one stroke be
hind OSU. All five squads are top-10 teams.
Stanford is not the only squad not living up to
expectations. New Mexico, which is not known
as one of the top teams in the West, stands in
sixth place at 305, one stroke ahead of top
ranked Tulsa. In addition, host school Arizona
State entered two teams, and its B team is one
stroke ahead of the A team in ninth.
Stanford is tied with Lamar at 3 13, 13 strokes
behind the Trojans. Kay Cornelius and
McCarthy lead the team with scores of 77, while
Kathy Kostas is at 79.
Julie Carmichael shot an 80 and Adrienne
Gilmartin recorded an 89.
"Kathy and Julie said they had played well
but weren't rewarded." McCarthy said.
The team is also attempting to acclimate itself
to a very different type of golf course from its
home Stanford course.
"It's a very unique golf course,'* McCarthy
said. "It doesn't have any trees, and the greens
are elevated. If you go for the pin a lot, you're
taking chances."
