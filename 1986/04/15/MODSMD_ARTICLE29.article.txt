Ultimate frisbee
The Stanford men's and women's
ultimate frisbee teams competed this
weekend in the first Stanford Invita
tional Halley's Comet Open. The in
tramural fields took on a colorful hue
as a myriad collection of tie-dyed and
silk-screened T-shirts mixed with
flying discs while 12 men's and eight
women's teams came together from
all over the West to battle for sepa
rate championships.
In men's play, Stanford defeated
the only other collegiate teams in the
tournament — Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and UC-Santa Barbara —
during the opening day, but a loss to a
talented club team — the South Bay
Fisters — on Sunday prevented
Stanford from reaching the semi
finals.
South Bay eventually won the
men's championship 17-14 over a
club team from Berkeley.
Stanford captain Peter Lyon said
that "the all-around performance of
the team was solid, especially the play
of quarterbacks Sandy Koonce, Peter
Hecht, Spencer Heywood and the in

spiring improvement of first-year
player Keith Sarkinson."
The Stanford men are now gearing
up for the Collegiate Sectionals in two
weeks, which will help determine
their seeding for the College Region
al in Santa Barbara on May 3 and 4.
In the women's division last
weekend, eight teams from California
and Oregon gathered to begin play on
a windy Saturday morning. The Car
dinal's first game was with an estab
lished club team from Santa Clara.
Stanford, which is building a team
from a base of a few experienced
players, was beaten by both the gusty
winds and the expert throws of its
competitor.
The Cardinal came back, however,
to beat Palo Alto and advance to the
quarterfinals against Humboldt.
The Humboldt game was very
competitive as both sides traded
leads. The contest eventually went
into overtime and, sparked by the
throws of Liz Applegate and key
catches by Cathy Stewart and Lisa
Mackey, Stanford came from behind
to win 12-9.
In Sunday's semifinals, the Cardi
nal was upended by the eventual

tournament-champion Berkeley
team. Nevertheless, Stanford's en
thusiasm remains high. "The future
abounds with possibilities," captain
Charlotte Lowson said.
Cycling
Despite a disappointing perfor
mance Saturday at the Santa Barbara
Road Race, the Stanford cycling team
came back to hammer out nearly 200
points at the Santa Barbara Criterium
on Sunday.
The Cardinal was led by Laura
Rodman, who won the women's race
and collected 39 points.
Russell Mead and Brad Chen
placed second and third, respectively,
in the men's A race, while Tom
Moyer took sixth. Bob Borchers
picked up additional points as well,
taking eighth in the B race.
Dave Bartholomew took home a
third-place trophy in the C race and
Jennifer Hubbert won Stanford
points with a sixth-place finish.
Saturday, the Cardinal did not fare

quite as well, losing several riders to
crashes. A bright spot was Tom
McMinn, who won the C race. Bor
chers sprinted for eighth place in the
B race, and Rodman finished fourth
for the women. Also scoring points
for Stanford were Bartholomew, Ed
Reuss, Pam Stevenson and Michelle
Stubbs.
Next weekend, the Cardinal cyclists
travel to King City and San Ardo for
two long road races.
Men's lacrosse
Playing without its first-string
goalie, the Stanford men s lacrosse
team struggled in the Michelob West
ern States Lacrosse Tournament held
last weekend at Stanford.
The Cardinal first fell victim to a
tough Seaspray team from Van
couver, Canada, on Saturday. The
visitors jumped out to an early lead
and were in command of the game
throughout.
"Every time we made a mistake,
they made a goal," Stanford's John

Patrick said. "Half of their goals were
behind-the-back and trick shots."
Patrick led the team with four goals
and four assists. Senior John Cox
added three goals.
Later in the day in the consolation
bracket, the Cardinal again lost, this
time to the San Francisco club team.
"1 think everyone was kind of down,"
Patrick said. "We could have beaten
them."
Stanford recorded its only victory
of the weekend on Sunday against the
Los Angeles club team by an 11-6
score. "We played really well, with
spread-out scoring," Patrick said.
The Cardinal played the entire
tournament without top goalie Peter
Manos. Sophomore Gene Delia Mag
giore filled in admirably, according to
Patrick.
"He did a great job," Patrick said.
"But it's hard to do anything against
the kind of players he was seeing."
Seaspray went on to capture the
tournament championship, beating
Whittier in the final game.
Stanford next plays Berkeley on
April 26. If victorious there, the Car
dinal will travel to Santa Barbara on

May 3 and 4 for the semifinals and fi
nals of the California Northern Divi
sion Playoffs.
Women's lacrosse
Avenging last weekend's 9-7 loss at
Berkeley, the Stanford women's lac
rosse No. I team knocked off
California 9-5 on Saturday en route
to a sweep of the competition at the
women's lacrosse tournament being
held on the Farm.
The No. I team also decisively beat
teams from Davis and UC-Santa
Barbara.
"It was a very high-scoring (tour
nament)," Stanford's Justina Ray
said. "Everyone was scoring.
Everyone deserves mention."
The No. 2 Cardinal team suffered
narrow losses against the Berkeley
and Santa Barbara teams, but re
bounded to wallop Davis.
The Cardinal is looking toward the
Seattle tournament in three weeks for
some emotional competition. Van
couver, Stanford's biggest rival, will
be competing in Seattle.

in the men's A race, while Tom
Moyer took sixth. Bob Borchers
picked up additional points as well,
taking eighth in the B race.
Dave Bartholomew took home a
third-place trophy in the C race and
Jennifer Hubbert won Stanford
points with a sixth-place finish.
Saturday, the Cardinal did not fare

quite as well, losing several riders to
crashes. A bright spot was Tom
McMinn, who won the C race. Bor
chers sprinted for eighth place in the
B race, and Rodman finished fourth
for the women. Also scoring points
for Stanford were Bartholomew, Ed
Reuss, Pam Stevenson and Michelle
Stubbs.
Next weekend, the Cardinal cyclists
travel to King City and San Ardo for
two long road races.
Men's lacrosse
Playing without its first-string
goalie, the Stanford men s lacrosse
team struggled in the Michelob West
ern States Lacrosse Tournament held
last weekend at Stanford.
The Cardinal first fell victim to a
tough Seaspray team from Van
couver, Canada, on Saturday. The
visitors jumped out to an early lead
and were in command of the game
throughout.
"Every time we made a mistake,
they made a goal," Stanford's John

Patrick said. "Half of their goals were
behind-the-back and trick shots."
Patrick led the team with four goals
and four assists. Senior John Cox
added three goals.
Later in the day in the consolation
bracket, the Cardinal again lost, this
time to the San Francisco club team.
"1 think everyone was kind of down,"
Patrick said. "We could have beaten
them."
Stanford recorded its only victory
of the weekend on Sunday against the
Los Angeles club team by an 11-6
score. "We played really well, with
spread-out scoring," Patrick said.
The Cardinal played the entire
tournament without top goalie Peter
Manos. Sophomore Gene Delia Mag
giore filled in admirably, according to
Patrick.
"He did a great job," Patrick said.
"But it's hard to do anything against
the kind of players he was seeing."
Seaspray went on to capture the
tournament championship, beating
Whittier in the final game.
Stanford next plays Berkeley on
April 26. If victorious there, the Car
dinal will travel to Santa Barbara on

May 3 and 4 for the semifinals and fi
nals of the California Northern Divi
sion Playoffs.
Women's lacrosse
Avenging last weekend's 9-7 loss at
Berkeley, the Stanford women's lac
rosse No. I team knocked off
California 9-5 on Saturday en route
to a sweep of the competition at the
women's lacrosse tournament being
held on the Farm.
The No. I team also decisively beat
teams from Davis and UC-Santa
Barbara.
"It was a very high-scoring (tour
nament)," Stanford's Justina Ray
said. "Everyone was scoring.
Everyone deserves mention."
The No. 2 Cardinal team suffered
narrow losses against the Berkeley
and Santa Barbara teams, but re
bounded to wallop Davis.
The Cardinal is looking toward the
Seattle tournament in three weeks for
some emotional competition. Van
couver, Stanford's biggest rival, will
be competing in Seattle.
Ultimate frisbee
The Stanford men's and women's
ultimate frisbee teams competed this
weekend in the first Stanford Invita
tional Halley's Comet Open. The in
tramural fields took on a colorful hue
as a myriad collection of tie-dyed and
silk-screened T-shirts mixed with
flying discs while 12 men's and eight
women's teams came together from
all over the West to battle for sepa
rate championships.
In men's play, Stanford defeated
the only other collegiate teams in the
tournament — Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and UC-Santa Barbara —
during the opening day, but a loss to a
talented club team — the South Bay
Fisters — on Sunday prevented
Stanford from reaching the semi
finals.
South Bay eventually won the
men's championship 17-14 over a
club team from Berkeley.
Stanford captain Peter Lyon said
that "the all-around performance of
the team was solid, especially the play
of quarterbacks Sandy Koonce, Peter
Hecht, Spencer Heywood and the in

spiring improvement of first-year
player Keith Sarkinson."
The Stanford men are now gearing
up for the Collegiate Sectionals in two
weeks, which will help determine
their seeding for the College Region
al in Santa Barbara on May 3 and 4.
In the women's division last
weekend, eight teams from California
and Oregon gathered to begin play on
a windy Saturday morning. The Car
dinal's first game was with an estab
lished club team from Santa Clara.
Stanford, which is building a team
from a base of a few experienced
players, was beaten by both the gusty
winds and the expert throws of its
competitor.
The Cardinal came back, however,
to beat Palo Alto and advance to the
quarterfinals against Humboldt.
The Humboldt game was very
competitive as both sides traded
leads. The contest eventually went
into overtime and, sparked by the
throws of Liz Applegate and key
catches by Cathy Stewart and Lisa
Mackey, Stanford came from behind
to win 12-9.
In Sunday's semifinals, the Cardi
nal was upended by the eventual

tournament-champion Berkeley
team. Nevertheless, Stanford's en
thusiasm remains high. "The future
abounds with possibilities," captain
Charlotte Lowson said.
Cycling
Despite a disappointing perfor
mance Saturday at the Santa Barbara
Road Race, the Stanford cycling team
came back to hammer out nearly 200
points at the Santa Barbara Criterium
on Sunday.
The Cardinal was led by Laura
Rodman, who won the women's race
and collected 39 points.
Russell Mead and Brad Chen
placed second and third, respectively,
in the men's A race, while Tom
Moyer took sixth. Bob Borchers
picked up additional points as well,
taking eighth in the B race.
