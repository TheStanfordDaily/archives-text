# Brennan signs top tennis prospect for Stanford
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
For the past several seasons, Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan has lured
Northern California's top junior wo
men's tennis player to the Farm, and
this year will be no different.
Sunday, Brennan's recruiting once
again paid off as he received a verbal
commitment from San Jose's Lisa
Green.
Green is not only Northern
California's top prospect, but she is
the No. 3 recruit in the nation, fol
lowing Patty O' Reilly, who has signed
with Duke, and Kerri Reiter, who will
attend Miami.
"She's really quite good," Brennan
said yesterday. "I'm excited about her
coming here."
Green, who attends Pioneer High
School in San Jose, chose Stanford

over other schools because of its ath
letic and academic reputation.
"The team's really good, and the
school is really good," Green said in
an interview last night.
Though she is currently ranked No.
1 in Northern California and No. 15
nationally on the junior circuit, Green
was relatively unknown as recently as
a couple of years ago.
"She wasn't a nationally known
name," Brennan said. "But she is
now."
Green attributes her recent rise in
prominence to mental adjustments
and increased national exposure.
"Last year I made the (Junior)
Wightman Cup team, so that helped,"
she said.
To break into the Cardinal lineup
will be a chore for Green. Currently,
Stanford is ranked No. 1 in the na
tion, and the Cardinal will return its

top seven players next season.
"The team is really tough and
deep," Green said. "It'll be hard to
break into the top six."
"I would think she would be
knocking at the door," Brennan said,
referring to her chances of making the
top six next season. "She's got a year
from now. A lot of things could hap
pen."
Through her junior career, Green
has been a baseline player. "She's a
very aggressive backcourt player,"
Brennan said. "She has excellent an
ticipation."
Brennan labeled Green as a "de
ceptive" player, noting that much of
her ability to win lies in her competi
tiveness.
"Lisa's a very feisty competitor,"
he said. "She's one of those players
who people say, 'Ah, she won't win,'
and then she wins."
