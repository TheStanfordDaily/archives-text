LOS ANGELES (AP) â€”
The Los Angeles Clippers have
scheduled a news conference
for today and are expected to
replace general manager Carl
Scheer with former Laker star
Elgin Baylor.
The Clippers finished the
NBA season with a 32-5 re
cord, third in the Pacific Divi
sion but not good enough for a
playoff spot.
They posted a reasonably
strong finish despite the loss of
Derek Smith, who was out most
of the season with a knee in
jury, the month-long absence
of veteran guard Norm Nixon
because of a contract dispute
and the slow development of
rookie center Benoit Benjamin.
