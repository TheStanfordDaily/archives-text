# Giants open in S.F.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Vida
Blue will be going after his 200 th
major league pitching victory and
trying to protect the San Francisco
Giants' First-place position when the
team takes the field for its Candles
tick Park season opener today.
A sellout crowd of more than
50,000 is expected for this after
noon's game against the Houston
Astros. The weather forecast in
cluded a threat of rain, and the
Giants' hitters face the threat of
pitcher Bob Knepper, who shut them
out on five hits last Thursday night in
Houston.
Most of the Giants' fans will be
getting their first looks at first base
man Will Clark, off to a .308 start in
the big leagues, and second baseman
Rob Thompson, the rookies who
cracked the 1986 starting lineup.
The Giants went 4-2 on their
season-opening road trip to climb
into the National League West lead, a
very unfamiliar place for the team
which finished last with a 62-100 re
cord in 1985. Two of the road vic-

Tories came in extra-inning thrillers
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, de
fending division champs.
In the final game of the three-game
weekend series at Dodger Stadium,
the Giants fell 3-2 but mounted a
ninth-inning threat against pitcher
Orel Hershiser.
"We battled them all series. No,
make that they battled us. We were
the aggressors," said Jeffrey Leonard,
the outfielder who went by the name
Jeff before this season.
"We'll play every game like it's the
last game of the World Series. That's
the approach this club has to take,"
Manager Roger Craig said early in
the road trip.
Leonard has a .357 batting aver
age, three homers and seven RBI
through one week of the season.
Center fielder Dan Gladden, at .357,
and catcher Bob Brenly, .400, are two
other players off to excellent starts
this year and aiming to come back
strong from miserable 1985 showings.
Leonard hit .241, Gladden .243
and Brenly .220 last season.
