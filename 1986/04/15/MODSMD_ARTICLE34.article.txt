U.S.-Japan trade talks end
WASHINGTON — Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
ended talks with President Reagan yesterday with a prediction that his
country's economic reforms should begin to ease the U.S.-Japan trade
imbalance this fall.
Reagan and Nakasone, who held discussions over two days, agreed
that Japan also should make some fundamental changes in its society to
gradually whittle down huge trade surpluses and promote international
economic harmony.
"I believe that Japan must tackle the epoch-making task of structural
adjustment and transform its economic structure into one dependent on
domestic demand, rather than exports, leading to a significant increase in
imports," Nakasone said in departing remarks in the Rose Garden.
"Japan must effect an historic turn, and I am determined to accept the
challenge."
Reagan praised Nakasone's commitment to undertake the difficult
task of restructuring Japan's export-oriented economy to make it mesh
better with those of Japan's trading partners.
"There are no quick or easy fixes, but we do know protectionism is not
the answer," Reagan said.
The changes Nakasone intends to promote are spelled out in a report
released in Japan earlier this month.
The recommendations include shortening the average work week
from six days to five, raising wages, encouraging more consumer spend
ing on housing and other personal comforts and reducing personal sav
ings.
The Japanese government will outline a "work schedule" to imple
ment the recommendations soon, Nakasone said, adding that some mea
sures can be put into effect immediately while others will take a long
time.
At a news conference after leaving the White House, Nakasone held
out hope that the United States' $5 . billion trade deficit with Japan —
which has tripled since Nakasone took office in 1982 — will begin to
ease soon because of such factors as Japan's earlier decisions to reduce
tariffs on 2, .00 items and to strengthen the value of the yen against the
dollar.
As a result, Japan's imports of manufactured goods, particularly
machinery, increased $5.4 billion in 1985 over the previous year,
Nakasone said.
"So. if we maintain this trend and also further expand domestic de
mand in Japan, then the trade relations between our two countries will
begin to change conspicuously," he said. "And I myself expect that
sometime around this coming fall, this trend will become tangible."
While Nakasone said Japan is willing to embrace wide-ranging re
forms in its economy, he said the United States should tackle high
budget deficits and lower interest rates.
Reagan and Nakasone also touched on Japan's 1983 decision to con
sider lowering barriers to imports of products in four major areas where
the United States excels in manufacturing — telecommunications,
sophisticated electronics, forest products and medical equipment and
pharmaceuticals.
A U.S. official, who spoke only on condition he remain anonymous,
said no new categories were added to the list but that trade negotiators
would discuss that issue later.
Tutu elected new church leader
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — Bishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his anti-apartheid campaign, yesterday
was elected leader of the Anglican Church for all of southern Africa.
The announcement came after a day-long meeting of some 500 Angli
can clergy and lay people who convened to choose a new archbishop of
Cape Town, the highest Anglican position in the region.
Archbishop Phillip Russell is retiring in August after five years on the
job, and Tutu will take over Sept. 1.
Tutu, who last year became Johannesburg's first black bishop, was
considered a leading contender to succeed but he was opposed by some
conservative whites who criticized his outspoken political involvement.
Other leading candidates were Bishop Michael Nuttall of Natal Pro
vince and Bishop Bruce Evans of Port Elizabeth, two whites who also
are vocal apartheid opponents.
American tried for war crimes
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia — Andrija Artukovic. who was extradited
from the United States, went on trial yesterday for Nazi war crimes. The
alleged "Butcher of the Balkans" appeared to doze as the prosecutor
read the indictment.
The 86-year-old former interior minister of the Nazi puppet state of
Croatia, who lived for years in Seal Beach, sat in a special enclosure of
bulletproof glass. His defense lawyers say he is senile and nearly blind.
Artukovic is charged with ordering thousands of people killed during
World War 11. He faces a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if
convicted in the trial, which is expected to last the rest of the month.
He wsa flown here Feb. 12 from the United States, where he had lived
for nearly 40 years. American courts ruled that he entered the country
under a false identity.
Artukovic had avoided extradition for years because of a law permit
ting people to remain in the United States if they might be persecuted in
their native countries for their political beliefs. The law was amended in
the late 1970s to allow extradition of people accused of persecuting
others.
Prosecutor Ivanka Pintar-Gajer told the court yesterday:"The ac
cused's crime, both in scale and in gravity, places Andrija Artukovic in
the ranks of the greatest and most notorious war criminals, whom man
kind has condemned in trials at Nuremburg and elsewhere."
She did not say what penalty she would ask. In Yugoslav courts, the
prosecution usually makes that request in its summation.
The indictment, summarizing eyewitness accounts and documents, ac
cused Artukovic of ordering the murders of an unspecified number of
Jews, Gypsies. Serbs and political prisoners. As interior minister of
Croatia, he was in charge of police and concentration camps.
Yugoslav authorities repeatedly have accused Artukovic of responsi
bility for at least 700,000 deaths. A preliminary indictment mentioned
231,000.
Artukovic ordered four separate massacres of civilians and partisans,
the 32-page indictment said. It gave grisly details about conditions in
Croatian concentration camps: babies slammed against prison walls,
living people crammed into ovens at the Jasenovac camp and Artukovic
urging his subordinates to kill Jews.
Only 16 foreign reporters were allowed into the courtroom. Others
watching on television monitors saw Artukovic. his mouth agape, nod his
head with his eyes closed as the indictment was read.
The defense contended in pre-trial statements that Artukovic was in
no condition to stand trial.
Artukovic answered promptly and correctly when Chief Judge Milko
Gajski asked him details about his biography, such as the year of his
birth and his mother's maiden name.

Sex' and lifelong companion of the late Jean-Paul Sartre, died yester
day. She was 78 years old.

after Sartre's death on April 15. 1980.
