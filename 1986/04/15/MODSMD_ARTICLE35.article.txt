# Challenger debris recovered

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. â€” A
salvage ship has recovered a two-ton
piece of Challenger rocket debris with
a 2-foot-square hole burned through
steel casing at the joint blamed for the
explosion of the space shuttle, the
Navy said yesterday.
The 10-foot-by-20-foot piece,
which could be vital to the investiga
tion, was pulled from the floor of the
Atlantic Ocean about 40 miles nor
theast of here by the Stena Work
horse after a robot submarine at
tached lift lines to it.
The retrieval was made at 5 a.m.
Sunday in 560 feet of water, the Navy
said.
Lt. Cmdr. Deborah Burnette, a
Navy spokeswoman, said the hole
burned in the joint and casing by a
plume of escaping flame measured
1-foot-by-2-feet. The surrounding
area was badly scorched..
The recovery was announced ear
lier by the presidential shuttle com
mission, and a member of the com
mission was coming here to inspect
the piece.
A statement by commission
Chairman William Rogers said: "One
of the two sections of critical interest"
was recovered and that it was from
the joint area where a leak in the right
booster rocket is thought to have oc
curred, causing the shuttle's explosion
on Jan. 28.
" A burnt out area of the joint tang
at about the 300 degree position is
evident," the statement said.
The other key piece, the bottom of

the joint, has not been located but is
believed to be in the same area.
Investigators have said the accident
that killed seven astronauts was
caused by a failure in this joint. But
they don't know exactly how it failed,
and they feel that by recovering the
part containing the joint they may
find out.
Experts believe a leak in the joint
allowed flame to escape, eventually
severing the bottom rocket attach
ment and causing the top of the
booster to swivel into the large exter
nal fuel tank, setting off the explo
sion.

J.R. Thompson Jr., vice chairman
of a NASA task force working with
the commission, said last week the in
vestigation is focusing on possibly
defective O-rings designed to stop hot
gases from escaping through the
joint; on the effect of the rotation of
the joint when subjected to ignition
pressures; on characteristics of the
putty intended to put pressure on the
rings; a possible joint alignment pro
blem; and the effect the freezing
temperatures and high winds aloft on
launch day might have had on the
rings or the putty.
Recovering the two pieces of the

joint have been high priority items of
the salvage team.
But Thompson said last month that
even if they were not recovered, he
believed there was sufficient evidence
to pinpoint the cause of the accident.
More recently, commission
member Richard Feynman said test
ing of sub-scale models designed to
recreate the conditions on the day of
the explosion would never be able to
find the exact cause.
Feynman said, however, that a new
joint could be built to prevent all pos
sible causes.
The man in charge of redesigning
the joint, James Kingsbury, head of
engineering at NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., said last week that 70 engineers
are working on 10 possible alterations
in the joint.
Eight of 11 salvage ships were at
sea yesterday, searching for other de
bris. Only about 20 percent of the
shuttle and its boosters and external
fuel tank have been recovered.
NASA is expected to announce
soon that it has completed operations
in the area where the crew cabin
wreckage and astronaut remains were
found. That area is 18 miles offshore
at a depth of 87 feet.
Most of the key cabin debris has
been retrieved, and sources report di
vers believe they have recovered all
the remains they expect to find.
The remains are being examined
and identified in a medical labora
tory here.
