# Marcos supporters, police clash

### 
MANILA, Philippines â€” Anti-riot police once
loyal to Ferdinand Marcos fired into a stone
throwing crowd of the ex-president's supporters
yesterday. One person was killed, hospital officials
reported.
They said some 60 people, including 18 police
men, were injured in the fighting at the City Hall in
the Manila suburb of San Juan.
The battle occurred several hours before pro-
Marcos legislators met in a Manila office building
and declared they had reopened the abolished Na
tional Assembly.
In the first major confrontation between police
and demonstrators opposed to President Corazon
Aquino, 60 police charged into nearly 1,000 people
blockading the San Juan City Hall.
The demonstrators were protesting the govern
ment's ouster of Joseph Estrada, a Marcos loyalist,
as the mayor of San Juan.
A police official claimed there was shooting from
the crowd, but the official police report did not
mention any guns in the hands of demonstrators.
Reporters saw some plainclothes officers in the
police lines armed with rifles.
Aquino, at a meeting with military commanders

Friday, asked them to show maximum tolerance for
the demonstrators, according to presidential
spokesman Rene Saguisag.
Meanwhile, the chief prosecutor in the case in
volving the 1983 assassination of Aquino's hus
band, ex-Sen. Benigno Aquino, formally accused
Marcos of interfering with the trial. Prosecutor
Manuel Herrera made the allegation in an affidavit
filed with the Supreme Court, which is considering
overturning the verdict acquitting 25 military offic
ers and one civilian.
Aquino, coasidered Marcos' main rival, was slain
at the Manila airport as he returned from self-exile
in the United States.
About 2,000 pro-Marcos people gathered in
front of the Asian Institute of Tourism where ex
legislators from Marcos' New Society Movement
met and declared they had reopened the National
Assembly, which Aquino abolished after she came
to power.
They cheered as Arturo Tolentino, Marcos' vice
presidential running mate in the Feb. 7 election,
entered the building.
Some of the Marcos supporters used stones and
sticks to chase away a smaller pro-Aquino group
that approached the area.

"We're still for Marcos," the crowd chanted in
the Tagalog language, waving banners that said:
"We want the legal president back" and "God
chose Marcos and Tolentino."
Pro-Marcos demonstrations have increased in
recent days, with 15,000 people at a downtown
rally Sunday and several hundred providing a de
fensive blockade for a radio station that said it re
ceived threats after carrying a live interview with
Marcos.
Some of the Marcos loyalists claim the allega
tions that the ex-president stole billions of dollars
in government funds were propaganda from the
Aquino government.
But little was said about Marcos in the meeting
attended by 93 members of the abolished 190-seat
parliament.
Tolentino, 76, did not take the oath of office
when Marcos had himself sworn in for another term
just hours before he fled his palace for exile in
Hawaii.
But Tolentino says he is the legal vice president,
and officials of the New Society Movement said
Tolentino will have a public oath-taking in a few
weeks.
