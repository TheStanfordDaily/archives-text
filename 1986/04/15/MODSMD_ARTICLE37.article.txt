Bombings questioned
NEW YORK — The car-bombing murder of
the No. 2 man in the nation's largest organized
crime family is a sign that underworld violence is
rising as Mafia leadership descends to younger,
less-experienced mobsters, the head of the state
Organized Crime Task Force said yesterday.
But the task force chief, Ronald Goldstock,
said it is too early to say why Frank DeCicco was
blown up on a Brooklyn street Sunday, and too
early to say if it would spur reprisals.
"There's a lot of speculation on a motive,"
noted Richard Nicastro, New York City chief of
detectives. "There's nothing concrete."
The blast that killed DeCicco and critically in
jured Frank Bellino, another reputed mobster,
came four months after the Manhattan curbside
shooting of Paul Castellano, 70-year-old boss of
the Gambino family.
Within weeks investigators were describing
John Gotti, the man who reportedly engineered
Castellano's murder, as his successor. Gotti later
chose DeCicco as his underboss, investigators ag
reed, but they differed as to why.
Some said the appointment was an attempt to
placate Castellano's supporters in the family,

while others saw it as a reward for having helped
set up Castellano for assassination.
Accordingly, some attribute DeCicco's killing
to revenge by the Castellano faction, while others
pointed to Gotti's desire to eliminate a man he
never fully trusted in the first place.
FBI funeral attended
MIAMI — FBI Director William Webster at
tended the funeral yesterday for one of two
agents slain in a gunbattle with suspected bank
robbers on the bloodiest day in FBI history, and
he praised the agents as heroes who gave their
lives to protect others.
Webster vowed an exhaustive investigation
into the duel and the background of the agents'
killers, a pair described as family men with no
criminal records who also died in Friday morn
ing's shootout.
"Before we're through, we're going to know
everything about them from the time they were
born to the time they died," Webster said of the
gunmen.
Webster joined more than 800 people packed
into Visitation Roman Catholic Church, which

slain agent Benjamin Grogan attended. An esti
mated 700 more, including Miami Mayor Xavier
Suarez, Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno
and hundreds of uniformed law-enforcement of
ficers, their badges handed in black, stood out
side.
"Like the prophets of old, Benjamin Grogan
and Gerald Dove gave their lives confronting the
effects of this type of moral disease," said Ar
chbishop Edward McCarthy.
