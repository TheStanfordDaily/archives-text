"Stalker" identified
LOS ANGELES — A sobbing woman pointed
to Richard Ramirez in court yesterday, saying he
was "the Night Stalker" who raped and
sodomized her in a bedroom where her murdered
husband lay under a sheet.
The young woman also indicated the assailant
sodomized her K-year-old son and said he forced
her to perform oral copulation on him before he
tied with the family's jewelry and money.
The woman frequently broke down and sobbed
into her hands at the hearing, which will deter
mine if Ramirez stands trial in a string of mur
ders. rapes and beatings that terrorized Southern
California last year.
Some spectators in the crowded courtroom

also wept as she struggled to explain the details of
her helpless captivity and hours of beatings and
rape.

were written by superspy John Walker, but a few
contained Whitworth's handwriting or finger
prints. The prosecution also contends Whitworth.
