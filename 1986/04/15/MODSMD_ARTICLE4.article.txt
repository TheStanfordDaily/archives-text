# Key trial decision due today
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
The fate of 23 Stanford protesters who are
standing trial for charges incurred during
October's anti-apartheid sit-ins will hinge on
a decision to be made this morning by
Municipal Court Judge Franklin Elia, attor
neys for the defense say.
Elia will decide whether or not to allow a
jury to hear what is known in legal terms as
the "necessity defense" â€” a defense that es
sentially justifies possible violation of the
law or statute providing the actions were
taken to prevent a greater harm.
"The decision is crucial to how the trial

proceeds. It is crucial as to whether we have
a jury trial that means much to anyone,"
defense attorney Tony Press said. Press, one
of six defense attorneys (three protesters
have decided to defend themselves), is rep
resenting senior Robby Perkins at this
week's trial in department 3 1 of the Palo
Alto Municipal Court on 270 Grant Ave.
County Public Defender Aram Jones,
who is now representing eight of the pro
testers, said the necessity defense is "a de
fense of justification." According to James,
in order to argue the necessity defense, the
group of protesters must show that their
sit-ins at Old Union on Oct. 11, 14 and 16
were the culmination of all reasonable at

tempts to prevent apartheid cruelties in
South Africa.
"If the necessity defense is not allowed,
the jury will be prevented from hearing a
large portion of the students' motives for
taking their action," James said.
In what he described as "an important
victory," James was able to get Stanford
Prof. Joel Samoff qualified by Judge Elia as
an expert witness to determine whether or
not divestment could cause change in South
Africa. Samoffs qualification indicates that
the judge feels there are important issues at
stake, James said.
