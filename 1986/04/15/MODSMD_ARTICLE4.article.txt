# Key trial decision due today
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
The fate of 23 Stanford protesters who are
standing trial for charges incurred during
October's anti-apartheid sit-ins will hinge on
a decision to be made this morning by
Municipal Court Judge Franklin Elia, attor
neys for the defense say.
Elia will decide whether or not to allow a
jury to hear what is known in legal terms as
the "necessity defense" — a defense that es
sentially justifies possible violation of the
law or statute providing the actions were
taken to prevent a greater harm.
"The decision is crucial to how the trial

proceeds. It is crucial as to whether we have
a jury trial that means much to anyone,"
defense attorney Tony Press said. Press, one
of six defense attorneys (three protesters
have decided to defend themselves), is rep
resenting senior Robby Perkins at this
week's trial in department 3 1 of the Palo
Alto Municipal Court on 270 Grant Ave.
County Public Defender Aram Jones,
who is now representing eight of the pro
testers, said the necessity defense is "a de
fense of justification." According to James,
in order to argue the necessity defense, the
group of protesters must show that their
sit-ins at Old Union on Oct. 11, 14 and 16
were the culmination of all reasonable at

tempts to prevent apartheid cruelties in
South Africa.
"If the necessity defense is not allowed,
the jury will be prevented from hearing a
large portion of the students' motives for
taking their action," James said.
In what he described as "an important
victory," James was able to get Stanford
Prof. Joel Samoff qualified by Judge Elia as
an expert witness to determine whether or
not divestment could cause change in South
Africa. Samoffs qualification indicates that
the judge feels there are important issues at
stake, James said.
The prosecution, led by Deputy District
Attorney Peter Waite, presented various
limiting motions which, if upheld, would
prevent certain evidence from being pre
sented in the trial. Three defense attorneys

summed up the prosecutions limiting mo
tions as keeping the defense from present
ing:
• evidence for the necessity defense;
• evidence of Stanford's divestment policies;
• unformation about the state of affairs in
South Africa;
• evidence of police brutality;
• or arguments about defendants' First
Amendment rights and political beliefs.
"Basically their view is: 'These people

were trespassing, let's find them guilty — no
other information is relevant,' " Press said.
Defense attorney John Starbuck said the
chances of winning the case are "excellent if
we get to present our full defense."
According to Starbuck, tomorrow's court
proceedings will include jury selection.
Twelve jurors will be selected from a pros
pective field of 495. Defense attorneys esti
mate between three to five days for the
selection process.
