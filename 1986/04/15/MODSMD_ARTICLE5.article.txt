# ASSU vote begins today
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
When polls for the ASSU elections open at 9 a.m.
today, students will be voting for a Council of Presidents,
senior class presidents and ASSU senators as well as de
ciding whether to adopt a new constitution.
The new constitution and three amendments are aimed
at cutting general ASSU bureaucratic red tape and pro
viding easy access for student groups seeking funding. The
proposed constitution eliminates alternate senators but
raises the number of voting senators from 20 to 30.
Additionally, the petition requirements for placing a
special fee request on the ballot would be lowered. The
language throughout the new constitution has been made
clearer so that it will be more accessible to all students,
proponents of the constitution say.
During the elections, students will also vote on some
controversial political issues, including a referendum to
make Stanford a sanctuary for El Salvadoran and
Guatemalan refugees and an advisory referendum on the
issue of total University divestment of stock in companies
doing business in South Africa.
Two slates running for COP advocate almost opposite
approaches to student government. The rarely serious
"Josh" slate is running under the motto "Fun is job one,"
and promises that its unorthodox style will enliven student
government and attract increased student participation in
the ASSU. "People will want to get involved (in the
ASSU) if we are COP because it will be a blast," members
of the slate say.
In contrast to the joking "Josh" slate, the "Real Solu
tion" slate emphasizes its dedication and commitment to
student government. All four of the individuals running
on this slate have held positions in the ASSU or a campus
minority organizatidn.
Three slates will contend for senior class presidents,
"Slate of Shock," "Slaughterhouse 4" and "Slate out of
Nowhere." All three have witty names and slogans and
promise senior pub nights, senior casino night and a dis
orientation week, plus more fun.
The race for ASSU senators proves to offer the widest
choice. Thirty-four undergraduates will be running for 10
senatorial positions and 10 positions as alternates. How
ever, only seven graduate students are running for 20
graduate senate posts. According to Elections Commis
sioner Robert Miller, the remaining slots will be filled by
"write-in" candidates.
Besides electing candidates, students will be asked to
vote on special fee requests. The largest request, $66,059,
is made by the Stanford Speakers Bureau and would work
out to $1.65 per person per quarter.
Polls will close tomorrow at midnight. Miller says that
he expects the results of the election to be in sometime
early Thursday afternoon.
