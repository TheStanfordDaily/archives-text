# University land annexation bill dropped
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
A bill designed to prevent San Mateo County
communities from annexing University property
was dropped after Stanford and its neighbors
agreed to tiy to reach an agreement together.
Assemblyman Dominic Cortese (D-San Jose)
cancelled today's hearing for the bill after last
Wednesday's successful meeting between rep
resentatives of Stanford. Menlo Park, Portola
Valley. Woodside and the county Local Agen
cies Formation Commission (LAFCo).
The meeting, held in Sacramento, produced
several results: Cortese said he would not rein
troduce the bill for one year; the San Mateo
County communities said they would not in
itiate annexation of University property for one
year; and the parties involved agreed to begin

negotiating an agreement outlining future use
and annexation of University property.
All parties involved in the annexation dispute
are eager to pursue negotiations and avoid state
legislation.
The meeting was "very positive," said Andy
Doty, director of community relations for the
University. The tone of the meeting was "very
friendly, and I think it's going to stay that way."
he added.
Sue Crane, mayor of Portola Valley, agreed
that the meeting was positive. "Everyone is in
terested in negotiating an agreement," she said.
The Woodside representative. Town Man
ager Les Doolittle, also said the meeting was
positive, adding that "Woodside and the Uni
versity have more areas of agreement than dis
agreement."

The University is hoping to negotiate an a
greement similar to one it now has in Santa
Clara County with Palo Alto, Doty said. That
agreement stipulates that University property
planned for academic use cannot be annexed
without permission. It also outlines uses of that
property and calls for the annex tion of property
planned for non-academic use.
But the situation in San Mateo County is dif
ferent, Crane said. The agreement with Santa
Clara County was made at a different time and
under different circumstances, she said, adding
that Palo Alto was already developed when
those negotiations began.
Doolittle also stressed that the current situa
tion in San Mateo County is different, citing the
fact that issues like the Stanford Shopping
Center and Stanford Industrial Park had been

decided when the Santa Clara County negotia
tions began.
The University's land use policy rules out
commercial use of the lands in question, but
Stanford's neighbors have said that even
academic uses could affect them adversely.
The two sides have different concerns in the
talks scheduled to begin in the next week.
Stanford's neighbors are most worried about
the "level of academic activity - ' on college land
next to its borders, while the University wants to
ensure that they do not annex property, pre
venting future educational use.
Both Crane and Doolittle said annexation
was not a major issue for their cities, but they
expressed concern over the population density
and traffic associated with future academic
buildings on neighboring University property.
Representatives attending Wednesday's
meeting included Crane; Doolittle; Ted Soren
son, Menlo Park vice mayor; Bill Davis, execu
tive director of LAFCo; and three University
representatives: Doty; Bob Freelen, vice presi
dent for public affairs; and Jacyn Mitchell, di
rector of government relations.
