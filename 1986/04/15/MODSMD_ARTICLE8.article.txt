# Kennedy: divestment unlikely
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
told representatives of the Black Student
Union (BSU) yesterday that if the student
body passes a referendum this week advising
divestment, the Board of Trustees will look
closely hut probably not take any action.
At a press conference following a meeting
with Kennedy yesterday afternoon, BSU
spokesman David Pryor said, "The BSU is
dismayed at the University's ambivalence on
the divestment issue. We see this as part of a
pattern of disrespect for the views of people
of color."
Pryor called for the University to support
the referendum on today's ASSU ballot and
"abide by the will of the majority."
BSU Secretary Amanda Kemp added that
"continued investment in South Africa

raises substantial doubts in the various
minority communities as to the University's
commitment to meeting our needs and re
specting our concerns."
Kemp said that in the meeting Kennedy
offered no new arguments against divest
ment of University holdings of companies
doing business in South Africa. He
explained that the University's trustees have
a responsibility not just to students now, but
also to students of the future.
"Basically, ijothing is going to change
(Kennedy's) mind except a new argument,"
Kemp said.
The BSU representatives also discussed
with Kennedy the possibility of altering or
changing Stanford's Western Culture cur
riculum. The group supports changes in the
present program because it "virtually ig
nores the contributions and existence of
people of color and women," Kemp said.
Possibilities for change in the Western

Culture program include adding anAmeri
can Culture track, as an alternative to the
existing choices, which would emphasize the
contributions of women and minority
gioups, and a more dramatic change from a
Western Culture program to a World Cul
ture program, according to Kemp.
Kennedy said he would be interested in
forming a student-faculty committee to dis
cuss changes in the Western Culture pro
gram, according to Kemp. She said that it is
likely that the administration and the BSU
will be able to work together on the issue.
The University's position on divestment
and the present Western Culture curriculum
"serves to obstruct Stanford's realization of
being a moral institution of higher learning,"
Kemp said. "The Black Student Union has a
vision of a university that is inclusive and re
spectful of all the members of which it is
composed."
