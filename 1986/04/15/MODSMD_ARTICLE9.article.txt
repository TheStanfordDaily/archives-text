# Students examine Lebanon problems
## 
### KEVIN MONTAGUE 
Four Lebanese students discussed the
problems facing their country during a pre
sentation on "The Lebanese Struggle for
Peace: The 1 Ith Anniversary of the Civil
War" at Bechtel International Center yes
terday.
Tayeb El-Hibri, Najib Abhoud. Amine
Khechefe and Fadi Chehade addressed the
problem of Christian-Moslem conflict in
Lebanon.
EI-Hibri began with a presentation of the
Moslem perspective of the conflict. He
traced the evolution of the country from its
feudal beginnings in the Ottoman Empire to
the European colonialism era to the forma
tion of a national constitution in 1926. With
only slight modifications, El-Hibri said, that
constitution is still in use today.
Following adoption of the constitution, the
major Christian and Moslem leaders met and
established a national pact. The pact was in
tended to provide for peaceful coexistence of
the Christians and Moslems, but instead has
been used to preserve the power of the op
pressive Christian minority, El-Hibri said.
El-Hibri said that while the pact was good
in principle, it is not effective because it fails

to address the many socio-economic groups
that were left out of it.
"The diverse religious oligarchy shaped
the opposition," he said. "There were many
groups . . . which were left out of the for
mula."
El-Hibri ended with an agenda of prop
osed changes, including increased welfare
programs for the poor, increased economic
development outside of Mount Lebanon, in
creased educational programs and an end to
confessional politics.
Chehade spoke from the viewpoint of the
Christian Lebanese. He drew parallels bet
ween the persecution of Christians in Egypt
and trends in Lebanon, then used the paral
lels to explain the growing climate of fear
and militancy in the Lebanese Christian
community.
According to Chehade, the Suni Moslems
broke the national pact, the basic agreement
of coexistence between Moslem and Christ
ian communities, by allying themselves with
outside Arab forces, especially the PLO.
He said the PLO used "passionate
ideological politics" on the youths of the
slums in Lebanon in order to use them
against the already "tottering" state.
