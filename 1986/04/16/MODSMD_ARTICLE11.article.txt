Correction: The Daily's editorial statement on
Monday regarding the Boathouse Party Area fee re
quest contained a serious factual error. We stated in
correctly that "... the old boathouse itself is slated to
be replaced within a few years. . . In fact, the Uni
versity has no plans to replace the boathouse. Accord
ing to Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Margaret Ann
Fidler, the University is contemplating making im
provements on the existing boathouse, although no
timetable has yet been established. Fidler further
explained that any boathouse improvements would be

far from extensive, and would likely fall far short of
making the boathouse deck safe for large parties again.
Hence, The Daily's characteriaztion of the proposed
boathouse as an "interim solution until the new boath
ouse is ready" was, quite simply, wrong. We sincerely
apologize to all concerned.
However, based upon serious concerns regarding the
project's funding and expense — outlined in Monday's
statement — The Daily editorial board stands by its
"No" recomendation on the Boathouse Party Area fee
request.
