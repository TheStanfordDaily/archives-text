## Viewpoint Kudos to Reagan for Libya strike 
### 
Before the media or any other critics of our gov
ernment have a chance to criticize the Reagan Ad
ministration's decision to attack Libya, I want to be
among the first to support and applaud the military
operation. Let's get it straight from the start that I
am not a warmonger, nor do I believe in irrationally
jumping to unnecessary measures on such matters.
But let's face it — Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy had it coming! For years he has actively
supported terrorists and terrorist operations that

ISAAC WINER

have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
innocent victims, including many Americans. It's
high time someone stood up for the value of human
life and civil decency that we hold so highly in the
free world today. President Reagan's decision to
use military force was not only prudent, responsible
and well thought out. but the decision came about
only as an alternative of last resort.
Some might argue that there are other means of
responding to terrorism that should have been at
tempted before using military force. Be not mista
ken! The United States, in its most recent attempts
to combat international terrorism and Khadafy,
exhausted all other means of persuading Khadafy
that terrorism is evil and that the free world will
simply not tolerate any terrorist activity. We have
tried political diplomacy as well as economic sanc
tions: neither seems to work. Terrorists and mur
derers such as Khadafy understand and respect
only one language — military force. I am not happy
that Libyan civilians might have been endangered
in the confrontation: I understand that they are not

necessarily to blame for their leader's irrationality.
Yet, as the leader of the free world, what precisely
is Reagan supposed to do when innocent Ameri
cans and others continue to be murdered at the
hands of terrorists supported by the government of
Khadafy. If the Libyan people fear further U.S.
retaliation to Khadafy's participation in interna
tional terrorism, they need only democratically do
away with their leader. Only 15 years ago the Li
byan people were friends of the United States. In
the streets of Tripoli today they burn the American
flag and shout screams of violence and hatred
under the deceptive leadership of their malevolent
leader.
While I understand that the use of military force
will not completely dissuade terrorist activity, it is
absolutely essential that the United States send the
message to Khadafy that those who continue to
participate in terrorist activity will pay a heavy price
for such unacceptable behavior. It is unfortunate
that this confrontation with Khadafy will probably
not be the last. However, sooner or later Khadafy
will learn that crime does not pay. The fact of the
matter is that nobody likes Khadafy. not even the
leaders of other Arab nations. While they might
publicly participate in condemning the U.S. attack
and supporting Khadafy, such lip service is mere
rhetoric intended primarily for the consumption of
radical Arab constituencies within Arab nations
themselves. Khadafy's active support of interna
tional terrorism destabilizes not only the Middle
East region but the entire world and is a menace to
the free world and an embarrassment to most Arab
leaders.
My only wish is that more countries, especially
our European allies, would participate in and sup

port the United States' attempts to combat
Khadafy and his malevolent activities. In the recent
confrontation only Great Britain actively supported
the military operation by allowing U.S. F-11l
bombers to take off from U.S. Air Force bases in
Britain. Hats off to Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. But the rest of our NATO allies, par
ticularly Portugal, Spain and France, should be
ashamed of themselves. None of these countries
allowed the planes from Great Britain to fly in their
air space, which consequently forced our pilots to
fly around Europe and through the Strait of Gib
raltar in order to access the international air space
of the Mediterranean Sea. God forbid if any of
those planes had crashed because they had to fly
such an unnecessarily risky, long and convoluted
distance, more than two times greater than the
shortest route.
But European unwillingness to support our gov
ernment's wishes is not surprising. After all, N ATO
has not paticipated in any U.S. economic sanctions
of Libya during the past three years, an action
which, if supported by NATO, could easily have
averted the most recent military confrontation.
Ironically, it is the people of the free European na
tions of NATO who suffer most from terrorist ac
tivities supported by barbarians like Khadafy. If the
free world's attempt to combat international ter
rorism in the future is to be optimally feasible, swift
and successful, the United States must have the un
selfish and undying support of her European allies.
Only then will there be an end to the madness, ir
rationality and violence associated with interna
tional terrorism and those who support it.

of the Mediterranean Sea. God forbid if any of
those planes had crashed because they had to fly
such an unnecessarily risky, long and convoluted
distance, more than two times greater than the
shortest route.
But European unwillingness to support our gov
ernment's wishes is not surprising. After all, N ATO
has not paticipated in any U.S. economic sanctions
of Libya during the past three years, an action
which, if supported by NATO, could easily have
averted the most recent military confrontation.
Ironically, it is the people of the free European na
tions of NATO who suffer most from terrorist ac
tivities supported by barbarians like Khadafy. If the
free world's attempt to combat international ter
rorism in the future is to be optimally feasible, swift
and successful, the United States must have the un
selfish and undying support of her European allies.
Only then will there be an end to the madness, ir
rationality and violence associated with interna
tional terrorism and those who support it.

Before the media or any other critics of our gov
ernment have a chance to criticize the Reagan Ad
ministration's decision to attack Libya, I want to be
among the first to support and applaud the military
operation. Let's get it straight from the start that I
am not a warmonger, nor do I believe in irrationally
jumping to unnecessary measures on such matters.
But let's face it — Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy had it coming! For years he has actively
supported terrorists and terrorist operations that

have been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
innocent victims, including many Americans. It's
high time someone stood up for the value of human
life and civil decency that we hold so highly in the
free world today. President Reagan's decision to
use military force was not only prudent, responsible
and well thought out. but the decision came about
only as an alternative of last resort.
Some might argue that there are other means of
responding to terrorism that should have been at
tempted before using military force. Be not mista
ken! The United States, in its most recent attempts
to combat international terrorism and Khadafy,
exhausted all other means of persuading Khadafy
that terrorism is evil and that the free world will
simply not tolerate any terrorist activity. We have
tried political diplomacy as well as economic sanc
tions: neither seems to work. Terrorists and mur
derers such as Khadafy understand and respect
only one language — military force. I am not happy
that Libyan civilians might have been endangered
in the confrontation: I understand that they are not

necessarily to blame for their leader's irrationality.
Yet, as the leader of the free world, what precisely
is Reagan supposed to do when innocent Ameri
cans and others continue to be murdered at the
hands of terrorists supported by the government of
Khadafy. If the Libyan people fear further U.S.
retaliation to Khadafy's participation in interna
tional terrorism, they need only democratically do
away with their leader. Only 15 years ago the Li
byan people were friends of the United States. In
the streets of Tripoli today they burn the American
flag and shout screams of violence and hatred
under the deceptive leadership of their malevolent
leader.
While I understand that the use of military force
will not completely dissuade terrorist activity, it is
absolutely essential that the United States send the
message to Khadafy that those who continue to
participate in terrorist activity will pay a heavy price
for such unacceptable behavior. It is unfortunate
that this confrontation with Khadafy will probably
not be the last. However, sooner or later Khadafy
will learn that crime does not pay. The fact of the
matter is that nobody likes Khadafy. not even the
leaders of other Arab nations. While they might
publicly participate in condemning the U.S. attack
and supporting Khadafy, such lip service is mere
rhetoric intended primarily for the consumption of
radical Arab constituencies within Arab nations
themselves. Khadafy's active support of interna
tional terrorism destabilizes not only the Middle
East region but the entire world and is a menace to
the free world and an embarrassment to most Arab
leaders.
My only wish is that more countries, especially
our European allies, would participate in and sup

port the United States' attempts to combat
Khadafy and his malevolent activities. In the recent
confrontation only Great Britain actively supported
the military operation by allowing U.S. F-11l
bombers to take off from U.S. Air Force bases in
Britain. Hats off to Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. But the rest of our NATO allies, par
ticularly Portugal, Spain and France, should be
ashamed of themselves. None of these countries
allowed the planes from Great Britain to fly in their
air space, which consequently forced our pilots to
fly around Europe and through the Strait of Gib
raltar in order to access the international air space
of the Mediterranean Sea. God forbid if any of
those planes had crashed because they had to fly
such an unnecessarily risky, long and convoluted
distance, more than two times greater than the
shortest route.
