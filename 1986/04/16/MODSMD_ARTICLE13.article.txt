# Step up affirmative action
## 
### 
A lot of people at Stanford are patting themselves on
the back this Spring about rejecting high school basketball
star Chris Munk's admission application. We are told that
Munk's rejection shows that academics are more impor
tant than athletics at Stanford (the one-time home of such
intellectual luminaries as John Elway, Tony Hill and John
McEnroe). But Munk's rejection also says something
about the status of affirmative action at Stanford, and the
message is more than a little disquieting. ,

As I understand it (from the San Francisco Chronicle,
not a source I like to rely on), Munk is a bright, persona
ble young black athlete from an economically deprived
broken home in one of San Francisco's poorest neighbor
hoods. Though not brought up in an intellectually rich en
vironment, Munk had a real desire to go to Stanford, and
brought his high school GPA up significantly at the same
time he moved out of the regular track of classes and into
the academic track. Simultaneously, he became one of the
nation's 10 best in his chosen extracurricular activity, bas
ketball. Nonetheless, the powers that be at Stanford de
cided that Munk must matriculate elsewhere.
Stanford is relatively proud of its record concerning af
firmative action. Stanford lets in a few more blacks,
Chicanos, Native Americans and Asian-Americans than
do comparable institutions in the East. But the raw num
bers are misleading. Stanford is letting in few if any blacks
from the ghettos, Chicanos from the barrios, native
Americans from the reservations or Asian-Americans
from the Chinatowns. Most of Stanford's minority stu
dents are from the same suburban environment that pro
duces most of Stanford's non-minority students.
I do not mean to say that Stanford's current "suburban"
minority group members don't deserve to be here; they
do. Most didn't need any kind of affirmative action to get
in. And of course most of Stanford's current minority
population have at one time or another been the targets of
prejudice and discrimination, and the rest of us can learn
much from their experiences.
But the "suburban" minorities have largely overcome
the discrimination which they have faced. There is a black
middle class in this country which is very hard to distin
guish statistically from the white middle class. The
Asian-American middle class is if anything more prosper
ous than the white middle class.
However, there is another minority population in this
country which hasn't even begun to overcome the cen

turies of prejudice and discrimination which it has faced.
For instance, the black underclass in America's cities is
probably worse off today than it was 20 years ago. It is this
kind of community which needs affirmative action, yet
these are precisely the people whom Stanford, and other
universities, are ignoring. Without educational oppor
tunities, the cycle of poverty in the inner cities must con
tinue, and another generation will go to waste there.
Some conservatives like U.S. Civil Rights Commission
Chairman Clarence Pendleton maintain that affirmative
action is immoral because it is itself discriminatory. It
might be true that affirmative action in favor of someone
like Pendleton himself would be discriminatory, since he
long ago overcame whatever racial prejudice he has faced
in his life. (In fact, Pendleton got rich by exploiting the
very same minority set-aside programs he now deplores.)
But there is no explanation for the continuing economic
and educational deprivation in barrios and ghettos except
for the current effects of past and present discrimination.
To tolerate this deprivation is to continue to discriminate,
and to continue to discriminate is the real immoral act.
When applied to residents of the inner cities, affirmative
action is not discrimination; it is a remedy for discrimina
tion. Only when it reaches the Harlems of this country is
affirmative action real, and not illusory.
The argument against real affirmative action at univer
sities is that it will "lower academic standards." The ar
gument doesn't wash. Except for a few extreme racists like
William Shockley, pretty much everybody agrees that in
tellectual potential is spread evenly throughout the popu
lation, including the inner cities. When Stanford accepts a
largely suburban student body, it is ignoring academic
potential, not cultivating it. The lack of poor, inner-city
admittees isn't a sign of high standards; it is a sign of lazi
ness in the Admissions Department.
Of course, it is harder to spot intellectual talent in
Oakland or Watts than it is in Atherton or Portola Valley.
Parents who had no educational opportunities themselves
have a hard time enriching the education of their bright
children. Unsafe inner-city schools with overworked, un
derqualified teachers stultify the students there who have
the most imagination and intelligence. Real affirmative
action requires looking beyond grades and test scores.
Sometimes real affirmative action requires taking a
chance on a "borderline case."
Having said all this, I can't be sure it applies to
Munk. Plenty of schools (DePaul, Georgia, UNLV and
North Carolina State spring to mind) will admit a basket
ball player who reads at an elementary school level. That
is exploitation, not education. Stanford can't and
shouldn't do remedial education at that level. But Stan
ford, like the rest of society, has a responsibility to the
economically-deprived, and it isn't discharging that re
sponsibility. I think it's time for Stanford to take a chance
on a few more Chris Munks.

not a source I like to rely on), Munk is a bright, persona
ble young black athlete from an economically deprived
broken home in one of San Francisco's poorest neighbor
hoods. Though not brought up in an intellectually rich en
vironment, Munk had a real desire to go to Stanford, and
brought his high school GPA up significantly at the same
time he moved out of the regular track of classes and into
the academic track. Simultaneously, he became one of the
nation's 10 best in his chosen extracurricular activity, bas
ketball. Nonetheless, the powers that be at Stanford de
cided that Munk must matriculate elsewhere.
Stanford is relatively proud of its record concerning af
firmative action. Stanford lets in a few more blacks,
Chicanos, Native Americans and Asian-Americans than
do comparable institutions in the East. But the raw num
bers are misleading. Stanford is letting in few if any blacks
from the ghettos, Chicanos from the barrios, native
Americans from the reservations or Asian-Americans
from the Chinatowns. Most of Stanford's minority stu
dents are from the same suburban environment that pro
duces most of Stanford's non-minority students.
I do not mean to say that Stanford's current "suburban"
minority group members don't deserve to be here; they
do. Most didn't need any kind of affirmative action to get
in. And of course most of Stanford's current minority
population have at one time or another been the targets of
prejudice and discrimination, and the rest of us can learn
much from their experiences.
But the "suburban" minorities have largely overcome
the discrimination which they have faced. There is a black
middle class in this country which is very hard to distin
guish statistically from the white middle class. The
Asian-American middle class is if anything more prosper
ous than the white middle class.
However, there is another minority population in this
country which hasn't even begun to overcome the cen

turies of prejudice and discrimination which it has faced.
For instance, the black underclass in America's cities is
probably worse off today than it was 20 years ago. It is this
kind of community which needs affirmative action, yet
these are precisely the people whom Stanford, and other
universities, are ignoring. Without educational oppor
tunities, the cycle of poverty in the inner cities must con
tinue, and another generation will go to waste there.
Some conservatives like U.S. Civil Rights Commission
Chairman Clarence Pendleton maintain that affirmative
action is immoral because it is itself discriminatory. It
might be true that affirmative action in favor of someone
like Pendleton himself would be discriminatory, since he
long ago overcame whatever racial prejudice he has faced
in his life. (In fact, Pendleton got rich by exploiting the
very same minority set-aside programs he now deplores.)
But there is no explanation for the continuing economic
and educational deprivation in barrios and ghettos except
for the current effects of past and present discrimination.
To tolerate this deprivation is to continue to discriminate,
and to continue to discriminate is the real immoral act.
When applied to residents of the inner cities, affirmative
action is not discrimination; it is a remedy for discrimina
tion. Only when it reaches the Harlems of this country is
affirmative action real, and not illusory.
The argument against real affirmative action at univer
sities is that it will "lower academic standards." The ar
gument doesn't wash. Except for a few extreme racists like
William Shockley, pretty much everybody agrees that in
tellectual potential is spread evenly throughout the popu
lation, including the inner cities. When Stanford accepts a
largely suburban student body, it is ignoring academic
potential, not cultivating it. The lack of poor, inner-city
admittees isn't a sign of high standards; it is a sign of lazi
ness in the Admissions Department.
Of course, it is harder to spot intellectual talent in
Oakland or Watts than it is in Atherton or Portola Valley.
Parents who had no educational opportunities themselves
have a hard time enriching the education of their bright
children. Unsafe inner-city schools with overworked, un
derqualified teachers stultify the students there who have
the most imagination and intelligence. Real affirmative
action requires looking beyond grades and test scores.
Sometimes real affirmative action requires taking a
chance on a "borderline case."
Having said all this, I can't be sure it applies to
Munk. Plenty of schools (DePaul, Georgia, UNLV and
North Carolina State spring to mind) will admit a basket
ball player who reads at an elementary school level. That
is exploitation, not education. Stanford can't and
shouldn't do remedial education at that level. But Stan
ford, like the rest of society, has a responsibility to the
economically-deprived, and it isn't discharging that re
sponsibility. I think it's time for Stanford to take a chance
on a few more Chris Munks.

A lot of people at Stanford are patting themselves on
the back this Spring about rejecting high school basketball
star Chris Munk's admission application. We are told that
Munk's rejection shows that academics are more impor
tant than athletics at Stanford (the one-time home of such
intellectual luminaries as John Elway, Tony Hill and John
McEnroe). But Munk's rejection also says something
about the status of affirmative action at Stanford, and the
message is more than a little disquieting. ,
