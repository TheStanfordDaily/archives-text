## Exercise ups insulin efficiency 
### JENNIFER SMITH Editorial staff 
We all know that regular exercise is
important to good health, and we
could all list plenty of reasons why.
Now a Stanford Medical Center study
has found a new reason. Regular
exercise has been shown to increase
the efficiency of sugar metabolism by
raising the body's sensitivity to insu
lin.
The study has important implica
tions for the treatment of "all people
for whom insulin doesn't work per
fectly well," according to Dr. Gerald
Reaven, Stanford professor of
medicine and endocrinologist. This
includes many older people, as well as
those with problems like type II diab
etes and hypertension.
Insulin is a hormone manufactured
by cells in the pancreas and secreted
into the blood stream after meals. It
stimulates glucose (sugar)
metabolism, allowing other body cells
to take glucose from the blood and
use it as fuel. This also stabilizes the
amount of sugar in the blood.
Reaven's study shows that those
who exercise regularly secrete less in
sulin in metabolizing glucose than
those who don't. This finding is "re
levant to a whole series of individuals
in which insulin may play an impor
tant role," according to Reavan.
People with type II diabetes, for in

stance, secrete insulin but are resis
tant to the action of the insulin. An
exercise program may help break
down this resistance.

The study also helps explain why
obesity may increase one's chances of
developing diabetes. Nearly two
thirds of all type II diabetics are
overweight.

The elderly are another group that
can benefit from the study. "When
people get older," Reaven said, "they
tend to transport glucose less effi-

ciently." This is partially due to the
fact that older people tend to get
heavier and more sedentary, he said.
Regular exercise can help normalize
glucose metabolism. However, Rea

ven said, the study was conducted
using subjects who exercised quite
heavily and there is an "ongoing ef
fort to find out how well-trained an
individual must be."
Although exercise increases muscle
mass, which in turn readily uses up
glucose, Reaven was able to control
for this change in body composition,
showing that increased glucose intake
is not totally a function of increased
muscle mass.
Specifically, the study determined
that exercise affects sensitivity to in
sulin at a sub-cellular level. When in
sulin is released into the blood stream
it binds to receptor molecules, which
is necessary for the cells' use of glu
cose. By comparing this process in
people who exercise and those who
don't, Reaven was able to isolate the
effect of exercise as occuring after in
sulin binds to the receptor. This, he
said, discounted the theory that exer
cise may somehow be simply in
creasing the number of receptors.
Future studies, Reaven said, will
further explore the sub-cellular
mechanism by which exercise in
creases glucose processing. His re
search team is seeking diabetic and
non-diabetic volunteers between the
ages of 20 and 75 to participate in
these studies. Anyone interested in
volunteering should contact Dr.
Claire Hollenbeck at 723-0266.
