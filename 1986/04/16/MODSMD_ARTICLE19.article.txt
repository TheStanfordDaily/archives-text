Blood is often called the "gift of
life ." Like any gift, it can be given
or received, and Stanford students,
according to Rhoda Burns, re
cruitment supervisor of the Stan
ford University Blood Bank, are
very good about giving blood in
the form of blood donations.
Burns estimated that Stanford
students make about 4.000 dona
tions to the Blood Bank over a
seven-month period. "No univer
sity donates as much blood as
Stanford," said Burns.
Blood is collected through vari
ous blood drives in dorms, frater
nities and the business and law
schools. The Blood Bank also has
many regular donors whom they
refer to as "repeat donors."
One kind of donation which has
increased three-fold in the last
year, according to a press release
from the Stanford Medical Center,
is autologous blood donations.
According to Burns, these are
blood donations people make for
themselves. "This is absolutely the
safest form of blood transfusion."
People often decide to make an

autologous donation before they
have surgery, Burns said. The
option must be ordered by a physi
cian, and donors will make three
to four donations a month or so
prior to surgery, since the Blood
Bank does not freeze blood. To in
crease awareness of this option.
Burns mentioned that the Blood
Bank is trying to spread the word
by informing more physicians
about autologous donations.
According to Burns, autologous
donations have increased due to
the fear associated with acquired
immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS). But Burns said research
has shown that directed donations
and regular volunteer donations
are just as safe.
Directed donations, according
to Burns, are donations in which a
person designates the recipient of
his blood gift. These cost more be
cause of the extra time and money
it takes to "isolate the donated
blood unit and save it for the pa
tient," Burns said.
To make sure blood is safe for
transfusion, the Blood Bank runs
tests on blood after a donation has
been received, according to Burns.
