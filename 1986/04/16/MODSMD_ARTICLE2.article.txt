# University bans DU Rush parties
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
In the wake of the fight early Fri
day morning that put a Stanford
freshman in the hospital with broken
ribs and a collapsed lung. Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano yesterday
banned all Rush and other social ac
tivities at the Delta Upsilon fraternity
and questioned the continued housing
and University recognition of the
DUs.
In a letter to DU President Scott
Hartman, Pisano wrote, "Until
further notice, there are to be no so
cial events sponsored by the members
of Delta Upsilon, with or without al
cohol, at the DU house or elsewhere.
This includes Rush events." The re
strictions will remain in effect pend
ing the outcome of an inquiry into the
altercation by the Office of Student
Affairs.
Both Pisano and Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Diana Conklin said
the future of the DUs on campus was
unclear. "I am quite alarmed at their
apparent lack of ability to control
their activities in any responsible
manner. I have to wonder whether
this is an environment that is safe for
Stanford students to live in or even to
visit. It is not at all clear to me that
they should continue to enjoy the
privilege of housing," Conklin said.
Row Director Conklin said she and
Pisano "will decide within the next
few weeks what action will be taken"
against the fraternity.
Although the Office of Student

Affairs is continuing to investigate the
role of other fraternities in the fight,
Pisano said the University decision
was "DU-specific." Conklin added,
"I would hope the community can
make distinctions between the DUs
and other fraternities."
The University decision against the
DUs comes after a series of events in
volving the fraternity, culminating
with the fight between David Curry
and two other freshmen shortly be
fore 3 a.m. Friday.
Curry was allegedly kicked by
freshmen Randy Von Feldt and Bill
McKelvy during the altercation,
which occurred after the three had
attended fraternity Rush parties.
On Monday, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons told The Daily that
Curry, McKelvy and Von Feldt were
"quite drunk" at the time of the fight.
In his letter to Hartman, Pisano wrote
that there exists evidence that "those
freshmen involved in the fight were
drinking with DU members shortly
before the altercation."
In addition to the fight, Pisano
wrote that the action against the DUs
"is necessary because of Delta Upsi
lon s history of alcohol misuse and
related abuses, because of the group's
apparent inability to control its be
havior, even in the face of a recent
probation, and because rushees were
served alcohol at the house after the
hours designated by the Interfrater
nity Council (IFC)." IFC regulations
prohibit the serving of alcohol at
