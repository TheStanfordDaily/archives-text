# University bans DU Rush parties
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
In the wake of the fight early Fri
day morning that put a Stanford
freshman in the hospital with broken
ribs and a collapsed lung. Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano yesterday
banned all Rush and other social ac
tivities at the Delta Upsilon fraternity
and questioned the continued housing
and University recognition of the
DUs.
In a letter to DU President Scott
Hartman, Pisano wrote, "Until
further notice, there are to be no so
cial events sponsored by the members
of Delta Upsilon, with or without al
cohol, at the DU house or elsewhere.
This includes Rush events." The re
strictions will remain in effect pend
ing the outcome of an inquiry into the
altercation by the Office of Student
Affairs.
Both Pisano and Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Diana Conklin said
the future of the DUs on campus was
unclear. "I am quite alarmed at their
apparent lack of ability to control
their activities in any responsible
manner. I have to wonder whether
this is an environment that is safe for
Stanford students to live in or even to
visit. It is not at all clear to me that
they should continue to enjoy the
privilege of housing," Conklin said.
Row Director Conklin said she and
Pisano "will decide within the next
few weeks what action will be taken"
against the fraternity.
Although the Office of Student

Affairs is continuing to investigate the
role of other fraternities in the fight,
Pisano said the University decision
was "DU-specific." Conklin added,
"I would hope the community can
make distinctions between the DUs
and other fraternities."
The University decision against the
DUs comes after a series of events in
volving the fraternity, culminating
with the fight between David Curry
and two other freshmen shortly be
fore 3 a.m. Friday.
Curry was allegedly kicked by
freshmen Randy Von Feldt and Bill
McKelvy during the altercation,
which occurred after the three had
attended fraternity Rush parties.
On Monday, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons told The Daily that
Curry, McKelvy and Von Feldt were
"quite drunk" at the time of the fight.
In his letter to Hartman, Pisano wrote
that there exists evidence that "those
freshmen involved in the fight were
drinking with DU members shortly
before the altercation."
In addition to the fight, Pisano
wrote that the action against the DUs
"is necessary because of Delta Upsi
lon s history of alcohol misuse and
related abuses, because of the group's
apparent inability to control its be
havior, even in the face of a recent
probation, and because rushees were
served alcohol at the house after the
hours designated by the Interfrater
nity Council (IFC)." IFC regulations
prohibit the serving of alcohol at
Rush parties after 10:30 p.m.
Hartman said that although he
closed the bar down at 10:30 p.m., a
keg of beer "intended for house
members only" remained in a DU
room. "There were some rushees who
got alcohol after hours," he said.
In another incident on Friday, a
member of the DU house dragged a
couch to a third-floor balcony of the
house, lit it on fire and pushed it over
the edge, Pisano said, adding that
while the incident resulted in no dam
age to the house, the police had to be
called to the scene. The DU
responsible for the incident has been
disassociated from the fraternity,
Hartman said. "We wanted to put out
to the Stanford community that that
was not acceptable behavior."
Noting that the result of the inquiry
into the fight and other incidents is
still pending, Hartman compared the
University's punishment of the DUs
to "handing out sentences before the
trial." While he admitted that the
three freshmen "did at least a part of
their drinking" at DUs, Hartman ac

cused the University of "attempting
to link [the fact] that they did drink in
our house" to the fight.
As a result of the police investiga
tion into the fight on Friday, Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said he
would submit a report to the District
Attorney's Office today recom
mending that a complaint be issued
for "felony battery" against McKelvy
and Von Feldt.
Curry was moved out of intensive
care at Stanford Hospital yesterday.
Since his condition has continued to
improve, police were able to inter
view him in the hospital yesterday,
Niemeyer said.
The fight apparently started on the
way from the Sigma Chi fraternity,
Niemeyer said. According to John
Christensen, president of the Sigma
Chis, "At 3 a.m., the three freshmen
... rudely tried to enter the house.
They came in and were promptly tos
sed out." Curry, McKelvy and Von
Feldt were in the house for no more
than five minutes, Christensen said.
Niemeyer called the incident "a
gross misunderstanding that resulted
in a brutal beating." He added that
"clearly, alcohol abuse caused this
situation."

freshmen involved in the fight were
drinking with DU members shortly
before the altercation."
In addition to the fight, Pisano
wrote that the action against the DUs
"is necessary because of Delta Upsi
lon s history of alcohol misuse and
related abuses, because of the group's
apparent inability to control its be
havior, even in the face of a recent
probation, and because rushees were
served alcohol at the house after the
hours designated by the Interfrater
nity Council (IFC)." IFC regulations
prohibit the serving of alcohol at
Rush parties after 10:30 p.m.
Hartman said that although he
closed the bar down at 10:30 p.m., a
keg of beer "intended for house
members only" remained in a DU
room. "There were some rushees who
got alcohol after hours," he said.
In another incident on Friday, a
member of the DU house dragged a
couch to a third-floor balcony of the
house, lit it on fire and pushed it over
the edge, Pisano said, adding that
while the incident resulted in no dam
age to the house, the police had to be
called to the scene. The DU
responsible for the incident has been
disassociated from the fraternity,
Hartman said. "We wanted to put out
to the Stanford community that that
was not acceptable behavior."
Noting that the result of the inquiry
into the fight and other incidents is
still pending, Hartman compared the
University's punishment of the DUs
to "handing out sentences before the
trial." While he admitted that the
three freshmen "did at least a part of
their drinking" at DUs, Hartman ac

cused the University of "attempting
to link [the fact] that they did drink in
our house" to the fight.
As a result of the police investiga
tion into the fight on Friday, Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said he
would submit a report to the District
Attorney's Office today recom
mending that a complaint be issued
for "felony battery" against McKelvy
and Von Feldt.
Curry was moved out of intensive
care at Stanford Hospital yesterday.
Since his condition has continued to
improve, police were able to inter
view him in the hospital yesterday,
Niemeyer said.
The fight apparently started on the
way from the Sigma Chi fraternity,
Niemeyer said. According to John
Christensen, president of the Sigma
Chis, "At 3 a.m., the three freshmen
... rudely tried to enter the house.
They came in and were promptly tos
sed out." Curry, McKelvy and Von
Feldt were in the house for no more
than five minutes, Christensen said.
Niemeyer called the incident "a
gross misunderstanding that resulted
in a brutal beating." He added that
"clearly, alcohol abuse caused this
situation."
In the wake of the fight early Fri
day morning that put a Stanford
freshman in the hospital with broken
ribs and a collapsed lung. Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano yesterday
banned all Rush and other social ac
tivities at the Delta Upsilon fraternity
and questioned the continued housing
and University recognition of the
DUs.
In a letter to DU President Scott
Hartman, Pisano wrote, "Until
further notice, there are to be no so
cial events sponsored by the members
of Delta Upsilon, with or without al
cohol, at the DU house or elsewhere.
This includes Rush events." The re
strictions will remain in effect pend
ing the outcome of an inquiry into the
altercation by the Office of Student
Affairs.
Both Pisano and Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Diana Conklin said
the future of the DUs on campus was
unclear. "I am quite alarmed at their
apparent lack of ability to control
their activities in any responsible
manner. I have to wonder whether
this is an environment that is safe for
Stanford students to live in or even to
visit. It is not at all clear to me that
they should continue to enjoy the
privilege of housing," Conklin said.
Row Director Conklin said she and
Pisano "will decide within the next
few weeks what action will be taken"
against the fraternity.
Although the Office of Student

Affairs is continuing to investigate the
role of other fraternities in the fight,
Pisano said the University decision
was "DU-specific." Conklin added,
"I would hope the community can
make distinctions between the DUs
and other fraternities."
The University decision against the
DUs comes after a series of events in
volving the fraternity, culminating
with the fight between David Curry
and two other freshmen shortly be
fore 3 a.m. Friday.
Curry was allegedly kicked by
freshmen Randy Von Feldt and Bill
McKelvy during the altercation,
which occurred after the three had
attended fraternity Rush parties.
On Monday, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons told The Daily that
Curry, McKelvy and Von Feldt were
"quite drunk" at the time of the fight.
