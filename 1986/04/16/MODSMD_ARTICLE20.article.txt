## McCarthy hurt as Card falls to 12th 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Following the progress of the
Stanford women's golf team at the
Lady Sun Devil in Phoenix, Ariz.,
one gets the impression that the
team is running on a treadmill,
moving at the same pace and
neither gaining nor losing much
ground.
The Cardinal shot 312 in yes
terday's second round of the 54-
hole tournament — a gain of one
stroke over Monday's opening
score — but cancelled that out by
falling out of an 1 Ith-place tie into
12th place.
However, Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin's "excuse" for the team's
performance, as he calls it, is
legitimate. Kathleen McCarthy
tore a muscle in her back during
the morning warmups, but played
nevertheless. Her round of 86,
normally poor by her standards,
now becomes impressive.
"She could hardly make a full
swing," Baldwin said.
McCarthy was treated yesterday
and will play tomorrow. Baldwin
was unsure whether or not she
would be any more effective.
However, there is still hope that
the Cardinal will show its top-10
form before the tourney ends.
"There are a lot of teams
packed around that score (625 for
the two days)," Stanford's Julie
Carmichael said. "I think we
should be able to move up to sixth
place if we play well tomorrow."
"We would have done well ex
cept (for McCarthy's injury),"
Baldwin said. "The other girls
played really well, (though) Ad
rienne Gilmartin played poorly."

Kathy Kostas paced the team
yesterday with a 75 on the par-72
Anasazi Golf Course to put her at
154 for the two days. Kay Cor
nelius leads the team with a 153
after shooting 76 yesterday.
Carmichael improved on an
opening round 80 with a 77, while
Gilmartin's 84 was her second
straight mediocre round (she shot
89 on Monday). McCarthy's injury
yesterday ruined a decent start in
the tournament, as her score
jumped to 163.
The real story of the tournament
is Florida's magnificent second
round. The second-ranked Gators,
tied for third (with San Jose State)
after Monday, shot a one-under
par 287 as a team to simply blow
by first-round leader USC and
take a 12-stroke lead over the
second-place Trojans, 589-601.
"They were just outstanding,
utterly outstanding," Baldwin
said.
Oklahoma State fell from sec
ond place to third, two strokes be
hind USC but five strokes ahead of
surprising New Mexico. UCLA
remained in fifth place at 609, with
San Jose State dropping to sixth
place, a stroke behind the Bruins.
Lamar broke its tie with Stan
ford by shooting 303 yesterday to
move into eighth place, four
swings behind U.S. International.
Top-ranked Tulsa and host
Arizona State round out the top
10.
With the whole team just 13
over par after two rounds, it is no
surprise that Florida has the top
two individual leaders so far.
Karen Davies is one-under for the
two days at 143, with teammate
Lisa Stanley just one-over at 145.
