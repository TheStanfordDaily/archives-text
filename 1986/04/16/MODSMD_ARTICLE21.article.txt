The last time the Stanford men's
volleyball team faced St. Mary's, the
match lasted 42 minutes and the
Gaels managed only 10 points. This
time around, the Cardinal is solidly in

faces top-ranked USC on Saturday.
USC is undefeated in conference
play.
"We have to win this game,"
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw said.

One of the keys to Stanford's drive for a postseason berth has been the
play of Steve Blue, who has 174 kills and leads the team's starters in hit

Mary's would put Stanford into the NCAA West regional.
