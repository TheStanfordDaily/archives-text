# Spikers look for playoff bid against St. Mary's
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
The last time the Stanford men's
volleyball team faced St. Mary's, the
match lasted 42 minutes and the
Gaels managed only 10 points. This
time around, the Cardinal is solidly in
fifth place in the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
(CIVA) with an 11-7 record, while
St. Mary's is in last place in the 11-
team league at 1-17. The match is to
night at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
The Gaels missed two starters in
that earlier match, however, as Paul
Beardon and Kevin McGuire were
both absent. The team has an excel
lent coach in Eugene Glazenberg, a
Soviet emigre and a former member
of the Soviet national team, but this is
the first season that the Gaels have
played in the CIVA and the first time
that volleyball has been a varsity
sport at St. Mary's. No recruiting has
been done until this year.
"St. Mary's was missing two star
ters last time," Stanford outside hitter
Jon Root said. "They're up and
down, and capable of playing well,
more so at home than on the road.
They don't have much experience
yet."
This match is important for Stan
ford, despite St. Mary's poor record.
The Cardinal must hold on to fifth
place to make the Western regionals,
and cannot afford to lose to the bot
tom team in the league, for the squad
faces top-ranked USC on Saturday.
USC is undefeated in conference
play.
"We have to win this game,"
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw said.
"It assures us a playoff spot because it

One of the keys to Stanford's drive for a postseason berth has been the
play of Steve Blue, who has 174 kills and leads the team's starters in hit
ting percentage at .320. A win for the Cardinal tonight against St.
Mary's would put Stanford into the NCAA West regional.
guarantees us fifth place."
The Gaels wiil have to dramatically
improve on their previous perfor
mance, as St. Mary's hit only .073 the
last time the two teams met as op
posed to the outstanding .458 per
centage the Cardinal totaled that
night. Stanford also scored five ser
vice aces in the match, all by Scott
Fortune.
Seniors Chris Braun and Root will
lead the Stanford effort. Both re
corded a team-high eight kills at St.
Mary's earlier in the year. Braun tops
the squad with 380 kills, followed by
sophomore Fortune who has 246.
Root is third with 235 despite being
injured much of the season. Steve
Blue has a .320 hitting percentage,
highest among the starters, to go
along with his 174 kills. Braun has a
.317 average on the year.
"We don't want to let up or look
ahead," Shaw said. "St. Mary's has
proved they can knock off a good
team by beating San Diego State."
When reminded that the squad
needed only 42 minutes to down the

Gaels last time. Root said confidently
of tonight's matchup, "I predict 52
minutes."
"Stanford is playing very well right
now." Glazenberg said. "They're in a
real good situation. They have a good
team, one of the best in the country.
It is difficult for us to play them, but
we will do our best and see what hap
pens."
The East regional will be played
this weekend, so Stanford will know
by Monday whether the team will
compete in the West regional — as
suming. of course, that the team
finishes league play in fifth place. If
favorite Penn State, the host of this
year's Final Four, loses in the East,
the Nittany Lions will most likely get
the at-large bid that usually goes to
the winner of the Western regional.
In that case, the top four CIV A
finishers will play for one playoff spot
instead of the conference winner au
tomatically receiving a bid and the
next four meeting in the regional to
battle for the at-large bid. If that hap
pens, the Cardinal will probably be
knocked out of postseason play.
"We're just hoping Penn State
wins," Shaw said. "Then there won't
be any problem."

This match is important for Stan
ford, despite St. Mary's poor record.
The Cardinal must hold on to fifth
place to make the Western regionals,
and cannot afford to lose to the bot
tom team in the league, for the squad
faces top-ranked USC on Saturday.
USC is undefeated in conference
play.

One of the keys to Stanford's drive for a postseason berth has been the
play of Steve Blue, who has 174 kills and leads the team's starters in hit
ting percentage at .320. A win for the Cardinal tonight against St.
Mary's would put Stanford into the NCAA West regional.
guarantees us fifth place."
The Gaels wiil have to dramatically
improve on their previous perfor
mance, as St. Mary's hit only .073 the
last time the two teams met as op
posed to the outstanding .458 per
centage the Cardinal totaled that
night. Stanford also scored five ser
vice aces in the match, all by Scott
Fortune.
Seniors Chris Braun and Root will
lead the Stanford effort. Both re
corded a team-high eight kills at St.
Mary's earlier in the year. Braun tops
the squad with 380 kills, followed by
sophomore Fortune who has 246.
Root is third with 235 despite being
injured much of the season. Steve
Blue has a .320 hitting percentage,
highest among the starters, to go
along with his 174 kills. Braun has a
.317 average on the year.
"We don't want to let up or look
ahead," Shaw said. "St. Mary's has
proved they can knock off a good
team by beating San Diego State."
When reminded that the squad
needed only 42 minutes to down the

Gaels last time. Root said confidently
of tonight's matchup, "I predict 52
minutes."
"Stanford is playing very well right
now." Glazenberg said. "They're in a
real good situation. They have a good
team, one of the best in the country.
It is difficult for us to play them, but
we will do our best and see what hap
pens."
The East regional will be played
this weekend, so Stanford will know
by Monday whether the team will
compete in the West regional — as
suming. of course, that the team
finishes league play in fifth place. If
favorite Penn State, the host of this
year's Final Four, loses in the East,
the Nittany Lions will most likely get
the at-large bid that usually goes to
the winner of the Western regional.
In that case, the top four CIV A
finishers will play for one playoff spot
instead of the conference winner au
tomatically receiving a bid and the
next four meeting in the regional to
battle for the at-large bid. If that hap
pens, the Cardinal will probably be
knocked out of postseason play.
"We're just hoping Penn State
wins," Shaw said. "Then there won't
be any problem."
