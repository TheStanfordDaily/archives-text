## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff writer 
Coming off an impressive showing against third-ranked
Arizona State last weekend, the Stanford softball team
enters today's doubleheader against Arizona with some
newfound confidence.
"It felt great being out there (against Arizona State),
first baseman Anna Sanchez said. "For the first time. I
believed that we were going to win. I look forward to this
game (Arizona), knowing that we can win."
Starting pitcher Lisa Buchanan echoed Sanchez's feel
ings. "We needed a boost like that (the Arizona State
game)," she said. "We have more confidence."
To beat Arizona, a team that has been traditionally
tough and has been consistently "up there." according to
Buchanan, Stanford will need to produce more offense.
"We've gotten people on base, but we have not brought
them home." Buchanan said. "It (scoring) takes a bunch
of hits."

Similarly, Sanchez stressed that Stanford needs to have
"total concentration at the plate" in order to break the
offensive drought.
For a doubleheader sweep or split, Stanford will proba
bly have to enhance its scoring output considerably
against Arizona. Not only do the Wildcats have some fine
hitters, but more important, they will not see too many
Stanford pitchers.
In fact, Arizona will only face Buchanan, who is
scheduled to pitch both games. Betsy Watson, the other
starting pitcher, is studying for MCATs and will be out
temporarily.
Buchanan, a solid starter for the Cardinal this season,
plans to rely mostly on the rise ball in the first game while
shifting to more off-speed stuff in the final game in order
to combat fatigue.
"It's a lot less tiring to throw the drop and curve," said
Buchanan.
Today's games will be played at Bay lands Field begin
ning at 1 p.m.
