# Stanford blanks UC-Irvine 6-0
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's tennis
team, yesterday's rain-delayed match
was well worth the wait. For the vis
iting UC-Irvine Anteaters, it was a
disaster.
After a two-and-a-half-hour delay
due to showers, the two teams took
the courts at 4 p.m. for what turned
out to be a rather quick stay. The
Cardinal swept all six singles matches
to record a 6-0 victory.
Due to the delay, the doubles
matches were not played, but the
victory still counts and raises Stan
ford's record to 13-3. The Anteaters'
record drops to 16-10.
Senior Dan Goldie and sophomore
Patrick McEnroe led the way for the
Cardinal in the No. 1 and 2 spots. The
pair swept easily through their
matches, with Goldie trouncing Ir
vine's Darren Yates 6-1, 6-1, and
McEnroe squashing Ken Derr 6-1,
6-2.
The lengthy wait before play began
didn't seem to affect the Cardinal
squad that much.
"It was a little tough waiting all
day," McEnroe said after the match.
"But I started off well and just sort of
cruised from there."
On the other hand, the delay
seemed to hurt the concentration of
the lOth-ranked Anteater squad, and
Irvine coach Greg Patton wasn't too
happy afterward.
"Our attitude sucked today," he
said. "My guys were wimps. This is
the first time ever in 10 years that
they've embarrassed me. (Yester
day's performance) isn't characteris
tic of these guys, but you can bet
they're going to hear it the rest of the
year."
Patton wasn't down on everyone,
however.
"My two guys who played fifth and
sixth played their hearts out after sit
ting around all day,"he said. "Let's

just say that if I had an opportunity to
play one of the best teams in the
country I'd rise to the occasion."
The fifth and sixth men, Mike
Downs and Mike Codigan. played the
only two close matches of the after
noon. Downs dropped the first set 6-4
to Stanford's Scott Moody, but rallied
to take the second by a 6-3 score.
Moody then toughed it out to win the
final set 6-3 and take the match.
In the sixth singles, Codigan lost
two close sets to Cardinal Mark
Jacobson, 6-4, 6-4. Jacobson was
performing with a mixed set of tools.
"I was volleying well and hitting
good approach shots," he said. "My
backhand and return (of serve) were
off. but I did have my forehand
going."
Earlier, Stanford seniors John Letts
and Eric Rosenfeld had completed
their matches to notch the third and
fourth Stanford victories of the day.
Rosenfeld was pitted in the No. 3
singles against a fellow baseliner,
Mark Kaplan. The Anteater gave the
Cardinal trouble early with long
baseline rallies, but Rosenfeld took
control midway through the first set
enroute to a 6-4, 6-0 victory.
In the No. 4 singles, Letts coasted
to his fourth consecutive victory, de
feating Julian Barham 6-3, 6-1.
The victory was the fifth consecu
tive win for the Cardinal. In the past
week, the Stanford players have lost
only two individual matches while
winning 29.
"I'll tell you â€” we're not playing
badly right now," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "We've had four
real good matches in a row now."
And with the Cardinal making an
important road trip to USC and
UCLA this weekend, that streak is
especially important.
"A match like this one going into
USC and UCLA is helpful," Gould
said. "The big thing now is how well
we are physically."
