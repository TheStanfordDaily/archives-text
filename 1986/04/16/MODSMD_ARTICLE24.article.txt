# After a B.A., not QBs
## Patriot star Veris returns to graduate

The final gun sounded the end of the 1984 Big
Game, and the scoreboard read Stanford 27, California
10. Senior defensive tackle Garin Veris grabbed the
Axe and held it high over his head. His finale as a col
lege player had ended up just the way he had hoped.
Most Stanford students thought they had seen the
last of Veris. But Veris and the New England
Patriots of the National Football League knew better.
They knew that he would make a fine defensive end in
the professional ranks. As a result. Veris was taken in
the second round of the 1985 NFL draft. Not only did
he make the Patriots' squad, he proceeded to start as a
rookie.
Through the efforts of Veris and his teammates. New
England breezed through its regular season and into
the playoffs as a wild-card team. They reached the
Super Bowl, only to lose to the Chicago Bears. Despite
the loss. 1985 was a storybook year for the 6-foot-6.
253-pound Veris. You see, Veris fulfilled a life-long
aspiration in less than one year.
"I guess I've always wanted to play pro ball since I
was in grade school." he said. "When you start to play
in Pop Warner and in high school it's a goal that
everyone dreams about. The desire just kept getting

stronger. I guess you could say that it (being drafted
and playing in the Super Bowl) was a dream come
true."
Veris, a native of Chillicothe, Ohio, was a coach's
dream. Originally recruited by former Stanford Coach
Paul Wiggin as a tight end. Veris was projected as a
player who could play either offense or defense. As a
tight end he had the size and speed to be a formidable
target. Defensively, his strength and size would allow
him to neutralize just about any running game. He, like
many other student-athletes here, chose the Farm over
many other schools because of its combination of
academics and athletics.
"I chose Stanford because it was a complete pack
age." he said. "It had a strong football program and
excellent academics. I came out here on my last re
cruiting trip about three or four days before letter of
intent day, and I fell in love with the place."
When he arrived on the Farm, Veris found out that
his future lay on defense. Veris was not pleased with
the coaches' decision, but he made the best of the situ
ation.
" As a freshman your main concern is getting playing
time. If the coaches thought that I'd make an impact on
defense, I was happy to play there. I did miss having

Instead of quarterbacks like Washington's Steve Pelluer, former Stanford standout Garin Veris has his
sights set on a political science degree, which he plans to get after two more quarters. In the fall, how
ever, Veris keeps his attention focused on signal-callers and running backs as a defensive end for the
New England Patriots.
my hands on the ball, though," Veris
said.
The coaches must have h d good
foresight. Veris quickly developed a
reputation in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence as a relentless pass rusher and an
impenetrable wall against the run. In
his senior year, Veris led the team in
tackles for losses (11) and in sacks
with five. He was named All Pac-10
and was an honorable mention All-
American.
But wait a minute. Wasn't there a
guy named Garin Veris on the Theta
Delta Chi basketball team that helped
it win the A League championship
this winter? Yes, they are one and the
same. Shortly after the end of the pro
season Veris returned to his old
haunts to finish up some coursework
for his political science degree.
"1 have about two quarters of work
left to graduate," Veris said. "De
pending on how we (the Patriots) do,
I should finish up either winter or
spring quarter next year. I arrived
back on campus about two weeks
before the basketball playoffs and 1

was asked to come back and play on
our team."
One would think that after being
away from school and thrust into the
national spotlight, coming back to
lectures, papers and Sunday Flicks
would be low on Veris list of things
to do. Veris disagrees.
"I came back to school with a new
attitude. I'm really able to do things
and enjoy school more than when I
was here playing football. I'm having
a good time."
Getting to the Super Bowl is a
career for most players in the NFL.
Veris made it in his first year, so what
is left for him?
"Obviously," Veris said, "the next
step is to get back and win. Getting
there was a lot of work for everyone,
but it's worth it. I'm going to continue
working hard to stay on top."
Football ends eventually for
everyone. What are Veris' plans for
the future? Simple â€” he just wants to
be successful.
"I'd like to have a long, good
career," he said. "After that, I hope
to have enough money saved up so
that I can live comfortably. Most of
all, I'd like to come out of football
healthy."
