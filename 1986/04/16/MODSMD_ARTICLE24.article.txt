# After a B.A., not QBs
## Patriot star Veris returns to graduate

The final gun sounded the end of the 1984 Big
Game, and the scoreboard read Stanford 27, California
10. Senior defensive tackle Garin Veris grabbed the
Axe and held it high over his head. His finale as a col
lege player had ended up just the way he had hoped.
Most Stanford students thought they had seen the
last of Veris. But Veris and the New England
Patriots of the National Football League knew better.
They knew that he would make a fine defensive end in
the professional ranks. As a result. Veris was taken in
the second round of the 1985 NFL draft. Not only did
he make the Patriots' squad, he proceeded to start as a
rookie.
Through the efforts of Veris and his teammates. New
England breezed through its regular season and into
the playoffs as a wild-card team. They reached the
Super Bowl, only to lose to the Chicago Bears. Despite
the loss. 1985 was a storybook year for the 6-foot-6.
253-pound Veris. You see, Veris fulfilled a life-long
aspiration in less than one year.
"I guess I've always wanted to play pro ball since I
was in grade school." he said. "When you start to play
in Pop Warner and in high school it's a goal that
everyone dreams about. The desire just kept getting

stronger. I guess you could say that it (being drafted
and playing in the Super Bowl) was a dream come
true."
Veris, a native of Chillicothe, Ohio, was a coach's
dream. Originally recruited by former Stanford Coach
Paul Wiggin as a tight end. Veris was projected as a
player who could play either offense or defense. As a
tight end he had the size and speed to be a formidable
target. Defensively, his strength and size would allow
him to neutralize just about any running game. He, like
many other student-athletes here, chose the Farm over
many other schools because of its combination of
academics and athletics.
"I chose Stanford because it was a complete pack
age." he said. "It had a strong football program and
excellent academics. I came out here on my last re
cruiting trip about three or four days before letter of
intent day, and I fell in love with the place."
When he arrived on the Farm, Veris found out that
his future lay on defense. Veris was not pleased with
the coaches' decision, but he made the best of the situ
ation.
" As a freshman your main concern is getting playing
time. If the coaches thought that I'd make an impact on
defense, I was happy to play there. I did miss having

Instead of quarterbacks like Washington's Steve Pelluer, former Stanford standout Garin Veris has his
sights set on a political science degree, which he plans to get after two more quarters. In the fall, how
ever, Veris keeps his attention focused on signal-callers and running backs as a defensive end for the
New England Patriots.
