# Card all washed out vs. SJSU
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
I he sun wasn't shining, the birds
weren't chirping and the ballplayers
weren't playing.
Yesterday's Sunken Diamond
matchup of No. 7 Stanford and non
conference opponent San Jose State
was cancelled due to rain.
The Cardinal will try again this af
ternoon, playing host to another
Pacific Coast Athletic Association
opponent, the University of the
Pacific. Game time is 2:30 p.m.
The Tigers bring a 4-5 PCAA re
cord and an 18-17 season mark to this
afternoon's game. Stanford and UOP
hist met a year ago, with the Cardinal
squeezing out a 5-4 victory.
The Tigers' likely starter is the ace
of their staff, righthander Mike Pitz.
Pitz sports a 7-1 record and spiffy

2.53 ERA coming into the game. He
has struck out 63 in 12 appearances.
Yesterday's cancellation was prob
ably a relief to the Cardinal, which
still faces a rugged schedule of seven
games in the next seven days. Stan
ford sits atop the Pacific 10 Southern
Division, tied with UCLA at 11-5.
The Bruins come to Stanford next
Monday for a make-up doub
leheader.
Before that, though, is a three
game homestand against Arizona
State. The Cardinal will try to use to
day's game as a springboard into the
weekend's league action.
Riding a three-game winning
streak, Stanford will look to continue
the hot hitting of the past weekend's
series with California. The Cardinal
collected 42 hits in its sweep of the
Bears, raising the team's Six-Pac bat
ting average to an outstanding .308.
