# Card women hoopsters sign prep All-American Azzi
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Since Tara VanDerveer took over as coach last sea
son, the Stanford women's basketball program has
gone nowhere but up. In her first year at the helm, the
Cardinal posted a 13-15 overall record, a significant
improvement over 1984-85, when Stanford went 9-19.
That improvement is likely to continue, as Stanford
has signed three outstanding recruits to letters of in
tent. Two of the three new players are guards, where
the Cardinal especially needs help due to the gradua
tion of senior point guard Virginia Sourlis.
The top find for Stanford is Jennifer Azzi, a 5-foot-7
point guard from Oak Ridge, Tenn. In her senior year
at Oak Ridge High School, Azzi averaged 15 points,
five assists, five steals and four rebounds per game.
"Jennifer is one of the top point guards in the coun
try and was recruited by all the top schools," VanDer
veer said. "She is a floor leader and a superb passer.
She sees the floor well and has excellent speed and
quickness at a position that is open and critical to our
success."

VanDerveer is not the only one who thinks highly of
Azzi. The East Tennessee Player of the Year was re
cruited by such national powerhouses as Ohio State,
Tennessee, Louisiana Tech and NCAA champion
Texas. She was named to the All-America teams of
Street and Smith, the Amateur Athletic Union and
Parade magazine.
"We are all very excited that Jennifer has decided to
attend Stanford," Van Derveer said. "She is a blue-chip
recruit."
Blue-chip would also be an accurate description of
5-7 guard Stacy Parson of Sylmar, who signed with
Stanford on Friday. Parson averaged 19.8 points, 10
rebounds, 5.6 assists and 3.6 steals per game for a
Kennedy High of Granada Hills team that went 21-3
this season.
Parson was named Most Valuable Player of the Los
Angeles area and earned a spot on Converse's All -
America team.
Stanford's third recruit is Katy Steding, a 6-1 for
ward from Lake Oswego, Ore. Steding, named Oregon
Prep Player of the Year, signed with the Cardinal dur
ing the early signing period in November.
