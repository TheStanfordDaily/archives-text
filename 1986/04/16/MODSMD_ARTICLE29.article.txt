U.S. diplomat shot in Sudan
WASHINGTON — An American employee at the U.S. Embassy in
Sudan was shot and seriously wounded yesterday in Khartoum, the State
Department said.
The spokeswoman said U.S. officials do not know who was responsi
ble for the assault, and no group has claimed responsibility. However,
the incident followed anti-American protests sparked by the U.S.
bombing of neighboring Libya.
The White House said it had few details about the attack, but spokes
man Dale Petroskey said President Reagan had been told of the shoot
ing.
State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman would not identify
the victim. v She initially identified him as a diplomat, but another State
Department spokeswoman, Diane Kelly, later described him as a
lower-ranking embassy employee who was not in a policymaking posi
tion.
The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that the victim was a techni
cian. Kelly would not confirm that, however.
Stockman said he was shot in the head by unknown assailants and has
been hospitalized in serious condition.
Robert Bruce, another State Department spokesman, said the Ameri
can was leaving the embassy in his car when another car drove up beside
him and shots were fired.
Bruce, who works on the department's Africa desk, said the attack
took place in the afternoon or early evening, Eastern Standard Time.
Earlier yesterday, about 200 demonstrators shouting "Down, down
U.S. A." marched through Khartoum's street to protest the U.S. air raids
on Libya.
Marchers, who included some Libyans, also shouted for the govern
ment to close the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum. They filed past the resi
dence of U.S. Ambassador Hume Moran with a truck filled with riot
police trailing behind, officials said.
In Washington, National Public Radio, quoting an Administration
source, said the attack was presumed to be a Libyan operation. It said
there had been several intelligence reports that the Libyans had been
planning some sort of action against U.S. officials in the Sudan.
Sudan was very close to the United States under the presidency of
Gaafar Nimeiri, but has mended fences with Libya in the year since he
was ousted in a bloodless coup on April 6, 1985. The United States is
among Sudan's largest aid donors.
The Sudanese foreign ministry described the U.S. attack on Libya
early yesterday as a dangerous threat to the region and to world peace.
The statement said Sudan was ready to supply its northwestern
neighbor with all possible helf for its victims, and appealed to friendly
countries to stand by Libya.
"It is regretful that events devloped in such a manner that the security
of a small state like Libya is threatened by a superpower like the U.S."
the Sudanese statement said.
In November, the State Department announced it was bringing home
some U.S. personnel and dependents from Sudan because of the pre
sence of Libyan terrorists in Khartoum.
The department said that because of terrorists and the failure of the
Sudanese government to deal with the situation, the embassy staff would
be reduced about 10 percent and Americans were being advised to stay
out of the city.
AT&T, pulls out of S. Africa
NEW YORK — American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has agreed to
cut its limited business ties to South Africa, but will continue to provide
basic long-distance telephone service to that country, the company con
firmed yesterday.
AT&T, although a giant in the United States, has no plants or sales
offices in South Africa. The move is important mainly for its symbolic
value, according to financial analysts and actists against South Africa's
racial policies.
AT&T plans to phase out purchases of precious metals from South
Africa, cut off computer sales and refuse to provide special long-distance
services such as international 800 dialing, spokesman John Geoghegan
said.
The company will announce the measures at its annual meeting today
in San Francisco, he said. The steps were negotiated with a group of five
employees at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.
"We do have shareowners and employees who are very deeply con
cerned on this issue (apartheid). Our involvement is really quite small; it
was easier for us than it might be for another corporation," said Frank
Ovaitt, AT&T's director of university relations and coordinator of the
South Africa issue.
Companies such as Ford Motor Co., U.S. Steel Corp., General Motors
Corp. and Citicorp have much greater involvement in South Africa, with
multimillion-dollar operations that employ thousands of South Africans.
Activists have urged the companies to withdraw, while the managements
have argued that they can do more good by remaining.
AT&T bought $5.5 million worth of platinum and palladium in 1985
under contracts with Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., a South African
mining company. AT&T gave a required two-year notice in December
1985 that it would allow the contract to expire at the end of 1987, Ovaitt
said. After that AT&T will meet its needs by recycling, he said.
Platinum and palladium are used mainly in relay contacts in sophisti
cated electronic equipment.
Schlesinger warns U.S. on oil
IRVING, Texas — The U.S. air strikes on Libya would have been im
possible without the world oil glut that has reduced the possibility of
Middle East oil boycotts against the United States, former Energy Sec
retary James Schlesinger said yesterday.
However, he advised representatives of 10 oil-producing states hit
hard by falling oil prices, increasing U.S. dependency on foreign oil is
sowing the seeds of another energy crisis that could throw the nation's
defense policies into disarray.
He noted that the only U.S. ally that supported the bombings was
Britain, the only European country except Norway with its own oil sup
ply.
Seven governors and representatives of three other oil-producing
states were scheduled to attend the "energy summit," called by Texas
Gov. Mark White to hash out the special crisis facing states that rely on
oil revenue.
Governors scheduled to appear with White were John Carlin of Kan
sas, Ed Herschler of Wyoming. Toney AnayaofNew Mexico, G.E.Nigh
of Oklahoma, George Sinner of North Dakota and Bill Sheffield of
Alaska.
Schlesinger, speaking at a luncheon, said the falling oil prices are "br
inging political instability to countries whose stability we are deeply con
cerned about." such as Egypt, Indonesia and Mexico.
He predicted that because the glut of crude and falling prices on the
world market are lowering new drilling and production in this country,
the United States will be more than 50 percent dependent on foreign oil
by 1990.
The Energy Department has reported that oil imports amounted to 34
percent of U.S. consumption in January, compared with 27 percent in
January 1985. The figure was 35 percent just before the 1973 Arab oil
embargo and 43 percent before the 1978 Iranian revolution.
That dependency on overseas oil "significantly constrains our foreign
policy, and if the United States is constrained there is no one to substi
tute for us." Schlesinger said.
"We can't win this as an economic issue. We need to stress the signifi
cance for national security and raise public awareness."
Falling prices are exacerbating the long-term problem of the nation's
strategic energy supplies. "But people aren't worrying about the 19905,
Schlesinger said.
