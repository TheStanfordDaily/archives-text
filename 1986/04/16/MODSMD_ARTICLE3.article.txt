# Prosecution error could lead to trial dismissal
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
An error by the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Office may result in the
dismissal of this week s trial involving 23
Stanford protesters.
Defense attorneys are citing prosecutor
ial misconduct, arguing that they were de
nied an adequate opportunity to prepare
potential defenses for the trial.
Their claims center around videotapes
made of the anti-apartheid sit-ins at Old
Union Oct. 11, 14 and 16. According to
defense attorney John Starbuck, tapes
were made of all three sit-ins and trans
fered to a master tape, which was edited by
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"Capt. Niemeyer went through the tapes
and edited what he thought was relevant,"
said Starbuck, one of six defense attorneys
involved in the trial. Niemeyer testified
before Municipal Court Judge Franklin
Elia today that he had told Deputy District
Attorney Peter Waite about the existence
of both edited and unedited tapes. Star
buck said.
The defense attorneys maintain they
were only given a copy of the edited tape
to prepare their defense. "We had made
repeated requests for the original version,"

Starbuck said.
Starbuck claims the unedited version
contains "a wealth of information" that
might have helped lawyers prepare a better
defense. "Three months with this faulty
tape and now all of a sudden there's
another tape," he said.
County Public Defender Aram Jones,
who is representing eight of the protesters,
said the existence of another tape caught
him "totally by surprise" and has promp
ted him to argue for dismissal of the case.
According to defense attorney Tony
Press, who is defending senior Robby Per
kins, "The prosecution has a duty to pro
vide all potentially relevant and exculpat
ory evidence well in advance of the trial.
Without knowing all the evidence, it is im
possible to prepare an adequate defense."
Waite called the tape incident "a mis
take."
"I think it's a technicality," he said, ad
ding that he didn't think the tape mix-up
was serious.
Starbuck disagreed with Waite's notion
of a simple mistake. "For a sharp pro
secutor as intelligent and experienced as
Mr. Waite, it seems unlikely that this was
something he did unintentionally," Star
buck said.
Calling the incident "something that was

lax and unprofessional," Starbuck said he
believed the trial should be dismissed "if
only to teach the District Attorney that he
can't do this again."
At the end of yesterday's court session.
Elia called for both sides to prepare points
and authorities regarding the videotapes.
According to James, the court impounded
all the videotapes that were to be used as
evidence. Elia indicated he would look
over the briefs during today's noon recess
and would reach a decision on the dismis
sal when the court reconvenes at around
1:30 p.m.
In what James called "a pivotal ruling,"
Elia ruled yesterday against allowing a jury
to hear the "necessity defense," one that
essentially justifies possible violation of a
law or statute providing the actions were
taken to prevent a greater harm.
Defense lawyers were hoping the neces
sity defense would be allowed, making it
possible for them to bring up issues such as
divestment and apartheid in South Africa
to explain the protesters' motives for their
sit-ins.
Concerning yesterday's decision, James
said, "We are disappointed, but we know
that Judge Elia made a good-faith ruling.
We'll live with the ruling, and we'll take it
from here."

Waite said he was pleased with Elia's
decision about the necessity defense. "It's
good because it focuses the issues of the
case on whether a violation of the law has
occurred and not on extraneous issues," he
said.
Lawyers for the defense said they are
disappointed in the community support.
"It was pathetic," said James of Monday's
opening-day attendance.
One of the 23 protesters standing trial
for charges of trespassing, unlawful assem
bly and refusal to disperse is Statistics Prof.
Charles Stein. In an interview with The
Daily last week. Stein, who has been
teaching at Stanford for 33 years, said the
protesters would be grateful if students
attended the trial. "The important thing is
that people do something about apar
theid," he said, adding, "I think it's more
important to stop Stanford's involvement
in South Africa than to win the trial."
Today's court proceedings will continue
the process of jury selection started yester
day. Twelve jurors will be selected from a
field of 495. According to James, defense
attorneys will be allowed to ask potential
jurors questions about divestment, Stan
ford and apartheid as it relates to divest
ment.
