# Raids may affect summit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The White
House yesterday proclaimed U.S. air
raids on Libya a success that "struck a
blow against terrorism." But the at
tacks appear to have jeopardized
prospects for a U.S.-Soviet summit
later this year.
Libya, meanwhile, apparently re
taliated by firing at a U.S. Coast
Guard installation on a tiny Mediter
ranean island 175 miles off the Li
byan coast.
In Tripoli, where many private
homes were damaged, it was clear the
raid" also left civilian casualties.
"Those bloody Americans say they
don't hit civilians," muttered Taher
Gubbia, a U.S.-educated English
professor outside the ruins of his
house.
Two Western diplomats, insisting
on anonymity, estimated about 100
people had been killed in the U.S.
bombardment of Tripoli. Libyan offi
cials said only that many people were
dead. Casualties in Benghazi were not
reported, but Libyan radio claimed
that homes, schools and a center for
the disabled were destroyed.
Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger sidestepped questions about
civilian casualties and damage to resi
dential buildings and the French Em
bassy, saying he was waiting for full
reports on the damage.
The U.S. bombing raid on Libya
also killed the 15-month-oid daugh
ter of Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy and seriously wounded two
of his young sons, doctors said yester
day.
President Reagan said "the United
States won but a single engagement in
the long battle against terrorism" and
pledged to continue with more strikes

if necessary.
"We would prefer not to have to
repeat the events of last night," he
told a group of business executives.
But he said that would be up to
Khadafy, whom he labeled as an
arch-terrorist.
"What is required is for Libya to
end its pursuit of terror for political
goals," said Reagan. "The choice is
theirs."
Presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes said the nighttime U.S.
bombings "successfully ac
complished" their main objectives of
damaging Khadafy's ability to perpet
rate terrorism and showing him the
United States would strike to punish
him for past attacks on Americans
and to pre-empt future ones.
An air and sea search was under
way for an Air Force F-111 fighter
bomber and its two-man crew missing
after the Monday night attack. The
Pentagon identified the missing air
men as Capt. Fernando Ribas-
Dominicci, 33, of Puerto Rico, the
pilot; and Capt. Paul Lorence, 31, of
San Francisco, the weapons systems
officer.
Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims
said rescue planes continued to search
over the water off Libya after dark
yesterday but had found "no evidence
of survivors, no beepers, no strobes"
to indicate where the lost plane went
down.
He said the search and rescue op
eration was not drawing fire and no
other U.S. forces were in the area, de
spite Libyan reports of a renewed at
tack.
The Soviet Union, responding to
the bombing raids, called off a plan
ned meeting next month between

Secretary of State George Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, casting doubt on plans
for a second summit this year bet
ween the leaders of the two countries.
The White House called the Soviet
decision "a mistake." Shultz and
Shevardnadze were to have discussed
arrangements for Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to the Un
ited States to meet with Reagan, a
trip the two leaders agreed on last
November but for which no date has
been set.
Speakes said: "The Soviet decision
shows where they stand on the im
portant issue of international ter
rorism. It also says something about
their commitment to work construc
tively on issues on the U.S.-Soviet
agenda, including arms reductions
and regional crises."
The raid's repercussions rippled
through the Mediterranean and be
yond:
• In Britain, which Prime Minister
Thatcher allowed to be used as a base
for the U.S. attack, opposition leaders
assailed her decision. Anti-American
protesters demonstrated outside U.S.
diplomatic in West Ger
many, Greece, Austria and Cyprus.
• The Arab world denounced the
military strike. Even U.S.-supported
Egypt, generally hostile to Libya, ex
pressed "alarm and strong resent
ment."
• At an OPEC meeting in Geneva,
Libya's petroleum minister called for
an oil embargo against the United
States.
Barely 15 hours after the bombing
of targets in and around Tripoli and
the western port city of Benghazi,
Libya announced a retaliatory strike

of its own against a U.S. telecom
munications station on the tiny
Mediterranean island of Lampedusa.
A U.S. Coast Guard spokesman
said at least two missiles were fired
from an unidentified ship or plane at
a Coast Guard long-range navigation
station on the Italian island north of
the Libyan coast.
The spokesman, Nicholas Sandifer,
said a report from the island indicated
the missiles landed in the water just
off the island, causing no damage or
casualties.
Speakes said the United States was
still assessing the situation and he
could not say what the response might
be. He said there were 31 Coast
Guard personnel at the long-range
navigation site and that they had no
weapons other than personal small
arms.
Speakes also confirmed that a truck
laden with rocket launchers had
exploded outside Yokota U.S. Air
Force Base in Japan at 3:10 a.m. PST
but said it was too early to say
whether the incident was the result of
a terrorist attack. He said there were
no injuries.
U.S. military and diplomatic in
stallations throughout the world are
on full alert, and Speakes said Ameri
cans have been constantly advised "to
be prudent and cautious when you're
traveling."
Speakes declined to say whether
the military operation agaiast Libya
was complete, but officials at both the
White House and the Pentagon in
sisted numerous times yesterday af
ternoon that no new U.S. action was
under way despite reports of new
episodes of anti-aircraft fire in
Tripoli.

professor outside the ruins of his
house.
Two Western diplomats, insisting
on anonymity, estimated about 100
people had been killed in the U.S.
bombardment of Tripoli. Libyan offi
cials said only that many people were
dead. Casualties in Benghazi were not
reported, but Libyan radio claimed
that homes, schools and a center for
the disabled were destroyed.
Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger sidestepped questions about
civilian casualties and damage to resi
dential buildings and the French Em
bassy, saying he was waiting for full
reports on the damage.
The U.S. bombing raid on Libya
also killed the 15-month-oid daugh
ter of Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy and seriously wounded two
of his young sons, doctors said yester
day.
President Reagan said "the United
States won but a single engagement in
the long battle against terrorism" and
pledged to continue with more strikes

if necessary.
"We would prefer not to have to
repeat the events of last night," he
told a group of business executives.
But he said that would be up to
Khadafy, whom he labeled as an
arch-terrorist.
"What is required is for Libya to
end its pursuit of terror for political
goals," said Reagan. "The choice is
theirs."
Presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes said the nighttime U.S.
bombings "successfully ac
complished" their main objectives of
damaging Khadafy's ability to perpet
rate terrorism and showing him the
United States would strike to punish
him for past attacks on Americans
and to pre-empt future ones.
An air and sea search was under
way for an Air Force F-111 fighter
bomber and its two-man crew missing
after the Monday night attack. The
Pentagon identified the missing air
men as Capt. Fernando Ribas-
Dominicci, 33, of Puerto Rico, the
pilot; and Capt. Paul Lorence, 31, of
San Francisco, the weapons systems
officer.
Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims
said rescue planes continued to search
over the water off Libya after dark
yesterday but had found "no evidence
of survivors, no beepers, no strobes"
to indicate where the lost plane went
down.
He said the search and rescue op
eration was not drawing fire and no
other U.S. forces were in the area, de
spite Libyan reports of a renewed at
tack.
The Soviet Union, responding to
the bombing raids, called off a plan
ned meeting next month between

Secretary of State George Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, casting doubt on plans
for a second summit this year bet
ween the leaders of the two countries.
The White House called the Soviet
decision "a mistake." Shultz and
Shevardnadze were to have discussed
arrangements for Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to the Un
ited States to meet with Reagan, a
trip the two leaders agreed on last
November but for which no date has
been set.
Speakes said: "The Soviet decision
shows where they stand on the im
portant issue of international ter
rorism. It also says something about
their commitment to work construc
tively on issues on the U.S.-Soviet
agenda, including arms reductions
and regional crises."
The raid's repercussions rippled
through the Mediterranean and be
yond:
• In Britain, which Prime Minister
Thatcher allowed to be used as a base
for the U.S. attack, opposition leaders
assailed her decision. Anti-American
protesters demonstrated outside U.S.
diplomatic in West Ger
many, Greece, Austria and Cyprus.
• The Arab world denounced the
military strike. Even U.S.-supported
Egypt, generally hostile to Libya, ex
pressed "alarm and strong resent
ment."
• At an OPEC meeting in Geneva,
Libya's petroleum minister called for
an oil embargo against the United
States.
Barely 15 hours after the bombing
of targets in and around Tripoli and
the western port city of Benghazi,
Libya announced a retaliatory strike

of its own against a U.S. telecom
munications station on the tiny
Mediterranean island of Lampedusa.
A U.S. Coast Guard spokesman
said at least two missiles were fired
from an unidentified ship or plane at
a Coast Guard long-range navigation
station on the Italian island north of
the Libyan coast.
The spokesman, Nicholas Sandifer,
said a report from the island indicated
the missiles landed in the water just
off the island, causing no damage or
casualties.
Speakes said the United States was
still assessing the situation and he
could not say what the response might
be. He said there were 31 Coast
Guard personnel at the long-range
navigation site and that they had no
weapons other than personal small
arms.
Speakes also confirmed that a truck
laden with rocket launchers had
exploded outside Yokota U.S. Air
Force Base in Japan at 3:10 a.m. PST
but said it was too early to say
whether the incident was the result of
a terrorist attack. He said there were
no injuries.
U.S. military and diplomatic in
stallations throughout the world are
on full alert, and Speakes said Ameri
cans have been constantly advised "to
be prudent and cautious when you're
traveling."
Speakes declined to say whether
the military operation agaiast Libya
was complete, but officials at both the
White House and the Pentagon in
sisted numerous times yesterday af
ternoon that no new U.S. action was
under way despite reports of new
episodes of anti-aircraft fire in
Tripoli.
WASHINGTON — The White
House yesterday proclaimed U.S. air
raids on Libya a success that "struck a
blow against terrorism." But the at
tacks appear to have jeopardized
prospects for a U.S.-Soviet summit
later this year.
Libya, meanwhile, apparently re
taliated by firing at a U.S. Coast
Guard installation on a tiny Mediter
ranean island 175 miles off the Li
byan coast.
In Tripoli, where many private
homes were damaged, it was clear the
