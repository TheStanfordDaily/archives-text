Contra aid set back
WASHINGTON — President Reagan im
plored the House yesterday to approve $100
million for contra rebels in Nicaragua, saying Li
byan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy has sent
weapons and advisers there to "bring his war
home to the United States."
As the House prepared to coasider Reagan's
request for military and other assistance for the
rebels, the president told a group of business
executives that Khadafy "has bragged that he is
helping the Nicaraguans because they fight
America on its on ground."
Addressing the American Business Council on
the day after U.S. warplanes bombed a host of
targets in Libya in reprisal for terrorist acts
against Americans, Reagan said: "I would re
mind the House voting this week that this arch
terrorist has sent $400 million and an arsenal of
weapons and advisers into Nicaragua to bring his
war home to the United States."
"We do not underestimate the brutality of this
evil man," Reagan said. "Col. Khadafy ought not
to underestimate either the capacity or legitimate
anger of a free people."
House Republicans, meantime, were fighting
to overturn parliamentary ground rules which
clouded prospects for approval of the Reagan
Administration's request.
The House in a near party-line 221-202 vote
rebuffed an attempt by furious Republican lead
ers to substitute new ground rules for ones im
posed by the House Democratic leadership.
The rules drafted by the Democratic majority
on the House rules committee were then ap
proved in a narrow 212-208 vote.
Republican leaders said the decision to tie the
contra aid plan to an unrelated $1.7 billion sup
plemental appropriations bill was a blatant politi
cal move designed to kill the aid program and
leave the rebels with no U.S. support of any kind.
But Democrats said the GOP should be grate
ful for a second chance of obtaining aid for the
anti-Sandinista guerrillas in light of their 222-210

defeat on the issue last month.
Only one Republican joined 220 Democrats to
oppose Reagan s position. Twenty-seven Demo
crats and 175 Republicans supported the White
House.
The parliamentary jockeying came as lawmak
ers began to consider anew Reagan's contra aid
program. The Senate approved the plan in late
March by a narrow margin, but with several con
ditions on how and when the money could be sent
to the counterrevolutionaries.
Airport arrest made
SALT LAKE CITY — A California woman
was booked for investigation of drug possession
after allegedly grabbing her purse and running
through an airport security checkpoint, forcing
officials to recheck 3,000 passengers, officials
said.
At least 25 flights were delayed more than an
hour Monday as the passengers and their baggage
were screened by metal detectors a second time,
said Tim Phillips, director of operations at Salt
Lake International Airport.
According to airport operations manager Tim
Riley, a woman was going through a checkpoint
when guards noticed an unidentified object and
asked her to open her purse.
Police Lt. Aaron Kennard said guards saw
what they thought was marijuana in the purse.
"She grabbed her purse and ran. With that, sec
urity was breached," he said.
Guards found the woman two minutes later on
a plane she had boarded with a companion, with
whom she apparently had switched bags, Riley
said. Because of the time lapse, passengers who
had already boarded planes were asked to leave
them with their carry-on baggage and all the
planes were searched before passengers were al
lowed to reboard, he said.
Kathleen Hoover, 24, of Concord, was booked
into the county jail for investigation of possession
of a controlled substance and bail was set at

$ 100, said Sgt. John Merrick.
An airport employee identified Hoover as the
woman who failed to open her purse, but told in
vestigators she was not carrying the same purse
when apprehended, said airport operations man
ager Frank Ratcliff.
Kennard said Hoover had a ticket for a Fron
tier Airlines flight to San Francisco.
He said Hoover's companion, Vickie Camp,
24, also of Concord, was questioned and re
leased.
The FA A planned to investigate the incident,
said C.C. Anthony, manager of the agency's field
security office in Denver.
Riley said that while passengers are sometimes
detained if they are suspected of possessing il
legal drugs, security personnel are primarily con
cerned with apprehending weapons.
"Because that bag was unaccounted for for
nearly five minutes, we couldn't guarantee the
safety of the passengers," he said.
Security at the airport had been tightened re
cently in response to worldwide terrorism, but
Riley said the incident would have sparked the
same response before.
Stocks up slightly
NEW YORK — Stock prices finished slightly
higher yesterday in a moderate session restrained
by the U.S. bombing raid on Libya, but many
market analysts predicted Wall Street's advance
would accelerate as the week progressed.
"I think the market's performance was unbe
lievably positive," said Theodore Halligan, an
analyst at the investment firm of Piper Jaffray &
Hopwood in New York. "The fact that the mar
ket did not take a hit indicates confidence in
President Reagan."
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks,
Wall Street's best-known indicator, advanced
4.34 points to 1,809.65 after seesawing in a nar
row range on both sides of Monday's closing level
of 1,805.31.
