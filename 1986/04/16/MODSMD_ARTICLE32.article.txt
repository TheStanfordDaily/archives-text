Espionage trial begins
BEALE AIR FORCE BASE — A 25-year
old airman was scheduled to go on trial yesterday
on espionage charges that accuse him of trying to
turn over classified information about his spy
plane squadron to the Soviet Union.
Airman Bruce Ott, an administrative clerk in a
squadron that flies the SR-71 spy planes, was ar
rested in January in Davis.
Air Force security officers said Ott attempted
to pass a copy of a classified regulation and his
squadron's personnel roster to a Soviet agent.
However, no secret material reached the Soviets,
according to an Air Force spokesman, Capt. Joe
Saxon. Ott pleaded innocent.
The SR-71, called the "Blackbird"' by the Air
Force, can fly at the edge of space at three times
the speed of sound and is equipped with sophisti
cated cameras and electronic equipment.
Ott originally was charged under a section of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice that carried
a possible penalty of death or life in prison.
But that section did not take effect until March
I. after Ott allegedly committed his crime, so he
was recharged under a code section that carries a
maximum penalty of 32 years in prison.

Lie test allowed
SAN FRANCISCO — Jurors in the Jerry
Whitworth spy trial can be told spymaster John
Walker flunked a lie detector test, a federal judge
said yesterday in a tentative ruling that bolstered
defense hopes to discredit the prosecution's star
witness.
U.S. District Judge John Vukasin rejected a
defense request to bar Walkers testimony, which
is scheduled to begin April 28. But Vukasin said
he had decided tentatively that evidence of the
lie-detector test would be admitted "for the li
mited purpose of questioning the credibility of
witnesses."
The prosecution said it would offer additional
arguments to try to get the judge to change his
ruling before lie detector evidence is offered.
Jarvis backs cuts
CITY OF COMMERCE — Tax activist How
ard Jarvis submitted petitions yesterday for a
November ballot initiative to reverse a California
Supreme Court ruling which Jarvis says circum
vents Proposition 13 limits on local tax hikes.

Jarvis, joined by economist Arthur Laffer, a
candidate for the Republican nomination for the
U.S. Senate in the June 3 primary, is spearhead
ing the initiative which he calls the Taxpayers
Voting Rights Act. He filed his petitions with the
Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder Office.
Jarvis' initiative would reverse a 1982 ruling by
the state Supreme Court that allows local gov
ernments to raise general taxes without the
two-thirds vote of the people required by Prop
osition 13. Proposition 13, which Jarvis authored
with retired Republican businessman Paul Gann
in 1978, cut property taxes by about 57 percent.
Jarvis said his initiative would allow citizens to
vote on local tax increases.
Laffer, accompanying Jarvis, repeated his re
commendations for a federal "flat tax." Laffer
said his plan calls for elimination of such major
federal taxes as gift, estate, income, corporate in
come, Social Security payroll and some minor
federal taxes.
