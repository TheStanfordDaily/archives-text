As all Stanford students know, the resident as
sistant plays a major role in a Stanford residence.
With 410 applicants for the approximately 190
RA positions available for the 1986-87 school year,
it's apparent that a number of students are anxious
for an opportunity to fulfill that role. Actually,
given the high number of RA applicants in past
years, this year's turnout is no surprise. "It's up six
from last year," according to Robin Hensley, pro-
gram coordinatory for Residential
Education.
What inspires many applicants to
apply for RA positions? "Mostly, I've
gotten a lot out of the Residential
Education program, and I wanted a
chance to give something back,"
explained junior John Hogan, an RA
applicant.
Junior Matt Fingerhutt said that he
hopes to find an RA position in a
freshman dorm. "For some people, it
(freshman year) is just a huge ad
justment, and if 1 could help some
people ease that transition period,
then that would be great," he said.
"To get students involved is really
important to me — especially
freshmen."

To accommodate the large number
of applicants, Hensley said that Res
Ed has tried to make the application
process as convenient as possible.
"We changed the process this year,
and we tried to give the applicants
more information sooner and make it
more streamlined," Hensley said.
"More information is in writing for
them, so hopefully there's less run
ning around for information."
The applicants, who attended gen
eral information meetings in March
and submitted their applications ear
lier this quarter, began group and indi
vidual interviews with resident fel
lows yesterday that will continue until
May 4.
The interviewing process will be
enough to keep both applicants and
RFs busy for the next couple of

weeks.
According to Toyon RF Gregson
Davis, "Each candidate will get two
interviews with us — one group 'get
acquainted' session for about two
hours, and an individual interview
that will last 20-30 minutes."
However, Davis also noted that
each RF is different. "This process is
not uniform," he said. "RFs have
different methods of doing this."
"I try to interview as many people
as possible," said Rob Robinson, RF
for West Court Lagunita. "Every
year, I seem to interview about 50
people."
Just as their interviewing styles
vary slightly, each RF has special
qualities that they look for in RA
applicants. Applicants were given an
indication of this in a booklet of RF

biographies that was provided by Res
Ed.
Davis stressed a sense of responsi
bility as a key characteristic for a
Toyon RA. "It's important, because
they have to make decisions every
day,"he said.
Robinson also mentioned several
traits he would be looking for in pros
pective West Lagunita RAs. "I cer
tainly look for people who are warm,
who strike me as the kind of people
whom others would go to with
academic and personal problems, and
people with a lot of enthusiasm."
"I think that most people are
looking for what I'm looking for,
perhaps with accents on different
things," Robinson said.
Current RAs stress that applicants
should be aware that the role of the

RA varies from residence to resi
dence. "It's different no matter what
house, and I've experienced that dif
ference," explained Kathy Ko, who
was an RA in Roble last year and is
currently an RA in Adams House in
Sterling Quad.
"Last year, it was a very large
dorm. I expected to do a lot more
counseling, but it ended up being a lot
more programming." Ko said. "This
year in Adams, it's been much more
what I thought of an RA job as being.
There's been an even balance bet
ween programming and counseling
problems."
Additionally, an RA position in a
Row House or theme house differs
from that in a larger dorm. "In theme
houses — at least in this one —
there's so much going on already,"

said Libby Osborne, RA in Haus
Mitteleuropa. "You find that a lot of
programming is done just sitting
around the dinner table."
Osborne said, "1 think one other
thing that comes to mind is that we
get a lot of people who are going
overseas or have just come back, so it
helps to have had the same experi
ence."
Whatever kind of residences
applicants would prefer to work in,
they should get a better indication
during the interviews.
On May 5, applicants will submit
their seven choices of residence to
Res Ed. Their choices will be
matched with preference lists sub
mitted by RFs. Letters of assignment
to 1986-87 RA positions will be
mailed out on May 13.

(freshman year) is just a huge ad
justment, and if 1 could help some
people ease that transition period,
then that would be great," he said.
"To get students involved is really
important to me — especially
freshmen."

To accommodate the large number
of applicants, Hensley said that Res
Ed has tried to make the application
process as convenient as possible.
"We changed the process this year,
and we tried to give the applicants
more information sooner and make it
more streamlined," Hensley said.
"More information is in writing for
them, so hopefully there's less run
ning around for information."
The applicants, who attended gen
eral information meetings in March
and submitted their applications ear
lier this quarter, began group and indi
vidual interviews with resident fel
lows yesterday that will continue until
May 4.
The interviewing process will be
enough to keep both applicants and
RFs busy for the next couple of

weeks.
According to Toyon RF Gregson
Davis, "Each candidate will get two
interviews with us — one group 'get
acquainted' session for about two
hours, and an individual interview
that will last 20-30 minutes."
However, Davis also noted that
each RF is different. "This process is
not uniform," he said. "RFs have
different methods of doing this."
"I try to interview as many people
as possible," said Rob Robinson, RF
for West Court Lagunita. "Every
year, I seem to interview about 50
people."
Just as their interviewing styles
vary slightly, each RF has special
qualities that they look for in RA
applicants. Applicants were given an
indication of this in a booklet of RF

biographies that was provided by Res
Ed.
Davis stressed a sense of responsi
bility as a key characteristic for a
Toyon RA. "It's important, because
they have to make decisions every
day,"he said.
Robinson also mentioned several
traits he would be looking for in pros
pective West Lagunita RAs. "I cer
tainly look for people who are warm,
who strike me as the kind of people
whom others would go to with
academic and personal problems, and
people with a lot of enthusiasm."
"I think that most people are
looking for what I'm looking for,
perhaps with accents on different
things," Robinson said.
Current RAs stress that applicants
should be aware that the role of the

RA varies from residence to resi
dence. "It's different no matter what
house, and I've experienced that dif
ference," explained Kathy Ko, who
was an RA in Roble last year and is
currently an RA in Adams House in
Sterling Quad.
"Last year, it was a very large
dorm. I expected to do a lot more
counseling, but it ended up being a lot
more programming." Ko said. "This
year in Adams, it's been much more
what I thought of an RA job as being.
There's been an even balance bet
ween programming and counseling
problems."
Additionally, an RA position in a
Row House or theme house differs
from that in a larger dorm. "In theme
houses — at least in this one —
there's so much going on already,"

said Libby Osborne, RA in Haus
Mitteleuropa. "You find that a lot of
programming is done just sitting
around the dinner table."
Osborne said, "1 think one other
thing that comes to mind is that we
get a lot of people who are going
overseas or have just come back, so it
helps to have had the same experi
ence."
Whatever kind of residences
applicants would prefer to work in,
they should get a better indication
during the interviews.
On May 5, applicants will submit
their seven choices of residence to
Res Ed. Their choices will be
matched with preference lists sub
mitted by RFs. Letters of assignment
to 1986-87 RA positions will be
mailed out on May 13.

As all Stanford students know, the resident as
sistant plays a major role in a Stanford residence.
With 410 applicants for the approximately 190
RA positions available for the 1986-87 school year,
it's apparent that a number of students are anxious
for an opportunity to fulfill that role. Actually,
given the high number of RA applicants in past
years, this year's turnout is no surprise. "It's up six
from last year," according to Robin Hensley, pro-
gram coordinatory for Residential
Education.
What inspires many applicants to
apply for RA positions? "Mostly, I've
gotten a lot out of the Residential
Education program, and I wanted a
chance to give something back,"
explained junior John Hogan, an RA
applicant.
Junior Matt Fingerhutt said that he
hopes to find an RA position in a
freshman dorm. "For some people, it
(freshman year) is just a huge ad
justment, and if 1 could help some
people ease that transition period,
then that would be great," he said.
