In the aftermath of the largest U.S. military opera
tion since the Vietnam War, Bay Area analysts are
taking a wait-and-see attitude toward events in Libya
as more details about Monday's air strikes come to
light.
The bombing of Libya's two largest cities by 33 U.S.
fighter jets should "give pause to nation-states who get
themselves directly involved" in promoting worldwide
terrorism, according to James Noyes, a research fellow
in Middle Eastern affairs at the Hoover Institution.
Noyes was referring to the alleged role of Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Khadafy in directing the bomb
ing of a West Berlin discotheque on April 5 that left
one American soldier dead and scores of others
wounded.
Noyes pointed to evidence of Khadafy's role in the
West Berlin incident, cited by President Reagan in his
address to the nation Monday night, as justification for
the air strikes. There is "no question'" about the cer
tainty of the evidence, which Reagan said consists of
messages passed between Khadafy and agents at
Libya's embassy in East Germany, Noyes said.
The agents allegedly carried out the attack on the

disco and sent a wire to Khadafy shortly thereafter tel
ling him the bombing was a success "and could not be
traced to Libyan people," according to a report in yes
terday's Los Angeles Times.
Noyes said those messages justified U.S. action, ad
ding that the attack was a "statement" to Khadafy that
state-sponsored terrorism is not risk-free. Noyes also
said the Reagan Administration had been looking for
an opportunity to make that statement since Reagan's
first week in office.
Apparently referring to the president's "swift and
effective retribution" remarks in his first inaugural ad
dress, Noyes said the Administration "oversold" the
American people on its "capacity to deal with ter
rorism. Once the haze of rhetoric had been lifted and
it became clear to the Administration that terrorists did
not form a distinct target against which force could be
directed, Noyes said the question became, "Who do
you bash?"
"In the Libyan situation, for once, there was a clear
link," Noyes said.
Noyes said he supported the Administration's action
against Libya, but expressed reservations about its
long-term effectiveness in eliminating terrorism.
