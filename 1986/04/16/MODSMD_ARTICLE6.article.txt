# Profs, create better solar cell

In an important breakthrough,
Stanford engineers have developed a
solar cell so efficient that it could sig
nificantly reduce the cost of solar
energy.
If successfully manufactured, the
new photovoltaic cell — the most ef
ficient ever demonstrated — could
generate enough electricity for mass
use.
According to Richard Swanson, as
sociate professor of electrical en
gineering and the leader of the team
that developed the solar cell, resear
chers have been able to convert 27.5
percent of the concentrated sunlight
flowing into the cell into electricity.
He predicts that the silicon-based
cell, which is located on the roof of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory,
will soon be 29 percent efficient.
In comparison, the highest effi
ciency rate reached by any other ex
perimental solar technology is 26 per
cent. Most solar cells available com

mercially can convert only 13 to 14
percent of the light reaching them.
"This 27.5 percent cell is the high
est photovoltaic cell efficiency of any
type. It represents something of a
world record, I guess you could say,"
Swanson said.
Swanson and his research team
have been working on the $200 mil
lion project for three years. He esti
mated that once the technology has
been fully developed, the solar cell
will produce electricity for a cost of
about $2 a watt — a cost substantially
lower than the current cost of $5 to
$8 per watt.
Swanson said use of the cell "would
be most economical where there is
the most sun, such as the desert
Southwest," adding that the cell
would be viable for other locations
that generally have good weather,
such as Texas and California.
The new cell is relatively cost
efficient because the system concen
trates sunlight and requires a smaller
and less expensive cell than other
conventional solar technologies.

Light coming into the system is
concentrated 500 times by a Fresnel
lens into a high-powered beam and
focused on the center of the cell. The
cell, made from an extremely thin sili
con slab, is called a "point contact
cell" because the electric current is
collected in a series of tiny holes or
points on the surface of the silicon
cell.
When the concentrated sunlight
hits the cell it excites electrons in the
silicon and then frees the negatively
charged particles by breaking chemi
cal bonds in the silicon. In conven
tional solar cells, many of these elec
trons recombine with positively
charged silicon cells before thev can
be removed. But in the new cells, im
purities have been added to the sili
con in the tiny holes or points, pre
venting most electrons from recom
bining.
If things go well with manufactur
ing, the new solar cell should be
generating large-scale power within
three years, Swanson said.
