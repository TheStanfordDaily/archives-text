# University puts grad benefit tax on hold
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Stanford will delay plans to with
hold tax on spring quarter tuition be
nefits for graduate students with
teaching or research positions, pend
ing congressional legislation which is
expected to exempt such tuition
benefits from taxation.
In a March 31 letter to campus de
partment heads, deans of schools and
graduate students with "taxable
teaching and research assistantships,"
Vice Provost Elizabeth Traugott

stated that although previous legisla
tion exempting such tuition benefits
expired Dec. 31, 1985, "it is consi
dered likely that an extension (of the
legislation), in one form or another,
will be enacted before the end of the
year ... we are postponing with
holding at this time."
Traugott said in the letter that if
Congress fails to renew the tax
exempt status of such students, tui
tion benefits received in 1986 will be
subject to taxation.
"In the meantime, the University
plans to collect data, on a quarterly

basis for each affected student, with
respect to the tuition award amount
to be reported as income assuming
(the legislation) is not extended,"
Traugott states in the letter.
"The amount which would be
withheld depends on each individual's
tax status," Traugott said Sunday. "If
[a student receives] no other income
the maximum would be around $500,
but a person receiving additional in
come might well be pushed into a
higher tax bracket."
Traugott estimated that a congres
sional decision not to extend the

exempt status of student TAships and
RAships would result in a withhold
ing of approximately $500 for 300 to
400 students. Students whose tuition
benefits would be taxed for the first
time would not be penalized for de
laying payment until April 1987.
"The complexities of the situation
are quite enormous," Traugott said,
adding that Congress has already mis
sed at least three deadlines by which
it was to have decided the issue.
"The last promise was last Tues
day,'' Traugott said. "The tax situa
tion in Congress is very volatile."
