# Halberstam rips 'Rambo' image

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Calling Sylvester Stallone "our new, cinematic
Joseph McCarthy, author David Halberstam last
night blasted the movie "Rambo: First Blood, Part
II" and its portrayal of the Vietnam War.
Halberstam, speaking before more than 150
people at Branner Hall, said the movie is "a very
real example of how to obliterate history, to sum
mon the worst kind of emotions."
In the movie, a box-office hit starring Stallone,
Halberstam said the Vietnamese are shown as
"weak and incompetent" people who are cruel and
need the help of advisers from the Soviet Union.
"There were no Russian advisers," Halberstam
said, refuting the movie's portrayal of the war.
"[The North Vietnamese] could teach the Rus
sians."
Halberstam said the U.S. citizens who fought in
the war or witnessed the action saw the "vitality,
toughness and bravery of the other side." He said
that despite greatly inferior artillery and weapons,
the Vietnamese were fighting "a war of passion, of
purpose."
"We had absolute military superiority, and they
had absolute political superiority," said Hal
berstam, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The

Best and the Brightest," an account of U.S. in
volvement in the Vietnam War.
Halberstam said the movie also "wipes out the
most important lesson of the war — that the world
is pluralistic" and does not conform to the political
ideology of one country.
"[The movie] reflects a kind of special American
ignorance of the world, and I think you see it today
in Central America— that these countries have no
history of their own," said Halberstam, who co
vered the Vietnam War for two years for The New
York Times.
Stallone's movies, including the "Rocky" series,
"reflect the worst kind of jingoism and, I think, the
worst kind racism," Halberstam said, adding that
Stallone has capitalized on "a sense of frustration in
the American people."
Halberstam compared Stallone to the hero
figure that John Wayne represented in movies after
World War 11. "IWayne] portrayed in celluloid
these roles but had never heard a shot fired in
anger." Stallone did not fight in Vietnam, Hal
berstam said.
"The idea that he is now perceived as a hero is
comic," Halberstam said, noting that there are two
kinds of war heroes, including "the false hero of
Mr. Stallone."
The other type of hero, he said, is the "quieter

kind, like Gov. Robert Kerrey (D-Neb.), who was
severely wounded in Vietnam."
Kerrey was scheduled to speak with Halberstam,
but was unable to come because of political matters
in Nebraska. In his place, Kerrey sent a 10-minute
videotape in which he gave his impressions and
views of the movie.
In the videotape, Kerrey said the movie s por
trayal of Vietnam veterans as "avenging types" was
inaccurate. Real heroes are "not on a mission of
vengeance, but on a mission of mercy," he said.
Writers from "Rambo" were also invited to the
discussion, but declined repeated invitations from
David Hoffman, a Branner resident assistant.
"It's not surprising that they're not here. I'd hate
to defend that movie," Halberstam said.
In a brief question-and-answer period that fol
lowed his speech, Halberstam commented on
Monday's bombings by the United States of Libya.
U.S. military power "is being used out of frustra
tion and rhetoric, without a kind of wisdom," Hal
berstam said, questioning whether U.S. action is "a
wise application of power."
"If you strike against a snake, are you going to
kill it?" he asked the audience.
"So far, what [the U.S. strike against Libya] has
done is show isolation from our allies," Halberstam
said.
