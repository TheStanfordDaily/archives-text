### 
The passage of a bill in the House last week aimed at
relaxing restrictions on the buying, selling and
transporting of firearms is, to say the least, way off tar
get.
Approved by a margin of 292-130, the bill would
mark the first significant change in the Gun Control
Act of 1968 â€” a law passed in the wake of the asssas
sinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert
Kennedy. If the bill becomes law, it will end the ban on
interstate sales of rifles and shotguns, ease record
keeping requirements on gun dealers, restrict the abil
ity of federal officials to conduct surprise investigations
of gun dealers and permit carrying firearms across state
lines.
The bill would retain the existing ban on the sale of
handguns across state lines, but this is a small victory
for gun control proponents in the face of a large defeat.
Instead of weakening gun control, Congress should
be working to strengthen it. Perhaps a tax on firearms
would act as a deterrent to would-be buyers. Some
states now require "hunter saftey" courses before ob
taining a hunting license, and a similar program could
be instituted nationwide to educate gun purchasers on
gun safety. But such efforts would hardly make up for

the damage that would result if the House bill becomes
law, which is likely to occur since a similar bill was
passed by the Senate last summer.
In light of a recent Gallup Poll showing that most
Americans favor some type of gun control, it is impor
tant to consider the lobbying efforts behind the House
bill. The National Rifle Association (NRA), one of the
most vocal interest groups in the nation and the major
proponent of the House bill, has argued for years that
gun control laws have placed too many restrictions on
law-abiding citizens who own firearms for protection
or sport. The strongest opponents of the bill, the na
tion's police officers, argue such legislation will impede
law enforcement and make the work of police officers
more dangerous. If the House bill becomes law, the
police Officers will have greater difficulty protecting
those law-abiding citizens who fought to weaken gun
control laws.
Because most police officers confront gun-related
violence every day, they make a convincing argument.
Yet in this case, it seems that money, not reason, may
have been the deciding factor. The NRA spent $1.6
million on its campaign against the 1968 law; the Inter
national Association of Chiefs of Police spent $ 15,000.
