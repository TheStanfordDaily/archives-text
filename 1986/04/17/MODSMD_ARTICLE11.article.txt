## Theme houses foster segregation 
### 
Once again, it's Draw time. Many people around
campus are talking about whom they want to live with and
where they should get priorities. And once again, I've
heard the praises of ethnic theme houses — "rich, reward
ing and enjoyable." In the Office of Residential Educa
tion's viewpoint (The Daily, April 10), "Theme Houses
offer cross-cultural learning," it states that ethnic theme
houses privde a profitable alternative for our academic
community. After living in Ujamaa for a year, I have a
much different perspective.

First of all, Res Ed states that theme houses offer a
residence where members of the ethnic community can
live in a "supportive, comfortable setting." They claim that
theme houses facilitate the transition from high school to
college; however, they fail to see the detrimental effects of
such a cultural cushion. In Ujamaa, for instance, incoming
freshmen are recruited to live in the theme house before
they graduate from high school. As freshmen, they receive
little of the "frosh" attention which other dorms on
campus provide. Instead of spending dorm funds on activ
ities which bring dorm members together both socially ad
intellectually, a large percentage of dorm dues are alloca
ted in support of the ethnic community. These causes are
worthwhile, but should they be such a significant expend
iture of dorm dues? Furthermore, these students often
remain in the same house throughout their Stanford years.
Failing to take full advantage of Stanford's diversity, they
obtain a limited view of campus life as they remain in the
security of the theme house.
The second and third points which Res Ed makes in
volve the enormous educational possibilities within the
theme house experience. In theory, living in a theme
house could be an extremely valuable experience. Much
can be learned from ethnic groups and their culture:
however, in this respect, Stanford theme houses ulti
mately become counterproductive.
My experience in Ujamaa illustrates that internal ten
sions eliminate much of their potential value. Whether it
is explicit or implicit, racial segregation exists within
theme houses on campus. The last spots filled in the Draw,
they house residents who often are forced to live there. As
a result, many residents feel alienated within their own
home. To accentuate this fact, the abundance of theme as
sociates and RAs give each resident very little impact on
dorm programming. Far from "comfortable, harmonious

and supportive," often residents don't even feel "at
home" in their own dorm.
Theme houses are not only segregated within — be
tween the members of the ethnic community and those
who drew over 4,000 — but also, they are separated from
the rest of the Stanford community. Stanford forever
professes diversity, but one who lives in a theme house
throughout his Stanford years fails to benefit from what
the rest of the campus has to offer. Why should Stanford
promote an artificial segregation of ethnic communities?
A valuable part of everyone's education should be learn
ing how to work together. Segregating certain communi
ties largely defeats this learning process.
The original intention of theme houses is definitely ad
mirable, but for years, Stanford's theme houses have
failed to fulfill their purpose. This is sufficiently demon
strated by the high Draw numbers and high turnovers

indeed, learn a lot about black culture and community,
but the environment was hardly conducive to this residen
tial education. Racial hostility and tension often over
whelm the potential benefits of the theme house system.
Ethnic communities can maintain a strong — and more
healthy — sense of unity through non-residential clubs
such as the Black Student Union or El Centro. By actively
promoting such groups, Stanford can eliminate many of
the problems inherent within theme houses without
sacrificing their positive aspects. With strong clubs, mem
bers can gain support and acceptance without being
segregated from the rest of the Stanford community.
Res Ed has attempted to create an intellectually
stimulating atmosphere in theme houses, but obviously
the system has failed in many respects. Isn't it time to rec
ognize the inherent flaws in the system and to move
toward a more integrated campus?

whelm the potential benefits of the theme house system.
Ethnic communities can maintain a strong — and more
healthy — sense of unity through non-residential clubs
such as the Black Student Union or El Centro. By actively
promoting such groups, Stanford can eliminate many of
the problems inherent within theme houses without
sacrificing their positive aspects. With strong clubs, mem
bers can gain support and acceptance without being
segregated from the rest of the Stanford community.
Res Ed has attempted to create an intellectually
stimulating atmosphere in theme houses, but obviously
the system has failed in many respects. Isn't it time to rec
ognize the inherent flaws in the system and to move
toward a more integrated campus?
