# For whom hometown voices toll
## 
### 
My hometown is a great place. Ernest Hemingway lived
there once. Do not think I am very much impressed by
that. He did not live there for a very long time — only for
about six months while working for The Kansas City Star
— and he did not use the Midwest as the backdrop for his
great stories of the absinthe-drinking, bullfight-loving
generation of the 19205. And though Kansas City may not
have been the moveable feast he later found in Paris, the
town is significant on the Hemingway map (his life in
many ways can be read like a journey on a map — from
the early days of Illinois and Michigan and Missouri, to
Italy and the war, and then, essentially across the globe:
France, Spain, Italy, Canada, Cuba, various parts of
Africa, Florida and Idaho) because it is where he began
as a journalist, a writing career in which he would toss the
English sentence on the grindstone and pound it back into
shape.

I was a young Hemingway fan: Sometimes this made my
life a little confusing — not knowing when I first started
writing whether I was making my own stories or whether I
was a Hemingway story myself. In any case, I used to
imagine his days roaming Kansas City as a newspaper
reporter. In Hemingway's time, Kansas City was a clean
town with fine, wide streets, many parks, some good bars
and plenty of parking. Today's version is not altogether
different. The buildings are more worn and have different
names or they are gone, and everything is probably a bit
more cluttered. That is the way things are when towns get
older. There are, however, some Hemingway landmarks
still around. I grew up in a house about a five-minute bike
ride away from one in which he worked on the conclusion
of "A Farewell to Arms" (this was in the late '20s while
on one of his stays with friends), and The Kansas City Star
building is still red-bricked and on 17th and Grand. The
intersection of 15th and Grand, which is the setting for a
vignette from "In Our Time," is just two streets down
from where my grandfather opened his parts business
when he came to Kansas City.
And then there is the story "God Rest You Merry,
Gentlemen" which takes place in one of the city's hospi
tals, and which begins — "In those days the distances
were all very different, the dirt blew off the hills that have
now been cut down, and Kansas City was very much like
Constantinople. You may not believe this. No one
believes this; but it is true." I was skeptical. It is a fine
story, though — it tells of a confused young boy who
comes into the emergency room on Christmas Day and
asks to be castrated, saying it is the penance for his lustful
ness; turned away, he is brough back later self-multilated
with a razor — and projects against a Kansas City setting
the kind of senseless, commonplace violence Hemingway
encountered during his war years.
I've seen all these Hemingway spots and that was fine,
but I discovered that I really couldn't find Hemingway in
them. I hear that if you go to Key West, Fla., there are
so many Hemingway sights that you begin to think of him
not so much as a writer but as a commercial phenomenon.

A look-alike contest is held each year and in the old days,
1 imagine every bartender or bar owner declared his es
tablishment the model for Freddie's Place in "To Have
and To Have Not."
So, more than anything else, Kansas City is suggestive
of Hemingway, and that is far nicer than having a business
of him. When 1 think' of my hometown, I think more of the
places around today than of those which Hemingway may
have frequented, and I know some good ones: Greek
places where they serve spicy appetizers and entrees with
lots of olive oil and afterwards a strong ouzo (I confess
that the first time I had this stomach-burning, heart
warming, dream-inspiring drink I smiled a little
Hemingwayishly while I poured drops of water into the
clear liquid, stir it into the whitish opaque so dear to him),
places where you can get newspapers and coffee and good
talk, all-night places where if you want pastrami at 3 a.m.
you can have it.
There's a really fine spot on Main Street called Mil
ton's. It is a jazz bar and you can go and sip brandy until
late into the night there and no one cares how old you are.
Milton Morris, who began the enterprise and who was a
major figure in the promotion of jazz in Kansas City, died
several years ago and the bar was bought by local business
interests. They only have live jazz one or two nights a
week, but in its place they make use of an extensive record
collection.
We used to go to Milton's growing up in Kansas City,
and I think old Papa Hemingway would have approved; it
was a place to sit and drink, and. most importantly, to ob
serve the different types who made up our town. Because
the bar shares a city block with an X-rated bookstore and
other forms of adult entertainment, there were always a
couple of rummies who loitered around. Then there were
mid-town folks who stopped in for a drink on their way
home. Jazz lovers would come just for the music. If
businessmen were there they would loosen their ties.
Visitors to the city would drop by to have a look, often
over-dressed. (No one makes himself look especially nice
to go to Milton's). Some, like us, would drive 20 minutes
just to take it all in.
We watched all these people from low couches which
were against the wall and facing the bar, or we sat at one
of the tables in between. When I looked at the faces,
seeing in some defeat, in others a vagueness, in some nos
talgia, in many a brightness made brighter with each drink
and well-handled sax duet piped through the stereo
speakers, I thought to myself these people have come to
this club which once made the neighborhood move to the
syncopated beat of the Jazz Age and which today relies
most on recorded material and liquor sales, a club now
oddly out of place from where it belonged, and we con
veniently call them Kansas Citians for no other reason
than the fact that they have collectively gathered them
selves to this one-time trading post on the Missouri River.
What I remember most distinclty is listening to them,
try ing to glean from their conversations — their words
and the way they used them — something of the character
of my hometown.
That is what the writer does. Ernest Hemingway did it
in my hometown, finding in the voices of its people his
voice, a voice which would speak to all of us. And having
listened to these hometown voices in Milton's, I've
decided that Kansas Citians have some interesting stories.
Maybe someday I will write them. I heard some pretty
good ones.

over-dressed. (No one makes himself look especially nice

just to take it all in.
We watched all these people from low couches which
were against the wall and facing the bar, or we sat at one
of the tables in between. When I looked at the faces,

and well-handled sax duet piped through the stereo

this club which once made the neighborhood move to the
syncopated beat of the Jazz Age and which today relies
most on recorded material and liquor sales, a club now
oddly out of place from where it belonged, and we con

in my hometown, finding in the voices of its people his
voice, a voice which would speak to all of us. And having
listened to these hometown voices in Milton's, I've

Maybe someday I will write them. I heard some pretty
good ones.

My hometown is a great place. Ernest Hemingway lived
there once. Do not think I am very much impressed by
that. He did not live there for a very long time — only for
about six months while working for The Kansas City Star
— and he did not use the Midwest as the backdrop for his
great stories of the absinthe-drinking, bullfight-loving
generation of the 19205. And though Kansas City may not
have been the moveable feast he later found in Paris, the
town is significant on the Hemingway map (his life in
many ways can be read like a journey on a map — from
the early days of Illinois and Michigan and Missouri, to
Italy and the war, and then, essentially across the globe:
France, Spain, Italy, Canada, Cuba, various parts of
Africa, Florida and Idaho) because it is where he began
as a journalist, a writing career in which he would toss the
English sentence on the grindstone and pound it back into
shape.

I was a young Hemingway fan: Sometimes this made my
life a little confusing — not knowing when I first started
writing whether I was making my own stories or whether I
was a Hemingway story myself. In any case, I used to
imagine his days roaming Kansas City as a newspaper
reporter. In Hemingway's time, Kansas City was a clean
town with fine, wide streets, many parks, some good bars
and plenty of parking. Today's version is not altogether
different. The buildings are more worn and have different
names or they are gone, and everything is probably a bit
more cluttered. That is the way things are when towns get
older. There are, however, some Hemingway landmarks
still around. I grew up in a house about a five-minute bike
ride away from one in which he worked on the conclusion
of "A Farewell to Arms" (this was in the late '20s while
on one of his stays with friends), and The Kansas City Star
building is still red-bricked and on 17th and Grand. The
intersection of 15th and Grand, which is the setting for a
vignette from "In Our Time," is just two streets down
from where my grandfather opened his parts business
when he came to Kansas City.
And then there is the story "God Rest You Merry,
Gentlemen" which takes place in one of the city's hospi
tals, and which begins — "In those days the distances
were all very different, the dirt blew off the hills that have
now been cut down, and Kansas City was very much like
Constantinople. You may not believe this. No one
believes this; but it is true." I was skeptical. It is a fine
story, though — it tells of a confused young boy who
comes into the emergency room on Christmas Day and
asks to be castrated, saying it is the penance for his lustful
ness; turned away, he is brough back later self-multilated
with a razor — and projects against a Kansas City setting
the kind of senseless, commonplace violence Hemingway
encountered during his war years.
I've seen all these Hemingway spots and that was fine,
but I discovered that I really couldn't find Hemingway in
them. I hear that if you go to Key West, Fla., there are
so many Hemingway sights that you begin to think of him
not so much as a writer but as a commercial phenomenon.

A look-alike contest is held each year and in the old days,
1 imagine every bartender or bar owner declared his es
tablishment the model for Freddie's Place in "To Have
and To Have Not."
So, more than anything else, Kansas City is suggestive
of Hemingway, and that is far nicer than having a business
of him. When 1 think' of my hometown, I think more of the
places around today than of those which Hemingway may
have frequented, and I know some good ones: Greek
places where they serve spicy appetizers and entrees with
lots of olive oil and afterwards a strong ouzo (I confess
that the first time I had this stomach-burning, heart
warming, dream-inspiring drink I smiled a little
Hemingwayishly while I poured drops of water into the
clear liquid, stir it into the whitish opaque so dear to him),
places where you can get newspapers and coffee and good
talk, all-night places where if you want pastrami at 3 a.m.
you can have it.
There's a really fine spot on Main Street called Mil
ton's. It is a jazz bar and you can go and sip brandy until
late into the night there and no one cares how old you are.
Milton Morris, who began the enterprise and who was a
major figure in the promotion of jazz in Kansas City, died
several years ago and the bar was bought by local business
interests. They only have live jazz one or two nights a
week, but in its place they make use of an extensive record
collection.
We used to go to Milton's growing up in Kansas City,
and I think old Papa Hemingway would have approved; it
was a place to sit and drink, and. most importantly, to ob
serve the different types who made up our town. Because
the bar shares a city block with an X-rated bookstore and
other forms of adult entertainment, there were always a
couple of rummies who loitered around. Then there were
mid-town folks who stopped in for a drink on their way
home. Jazz lovers would come just for the music. If
businessmen were there they would loosen their ties.
Visitors to the city would drop by to have a look, often
over-dressed. (No one makes himself look especially nice
to go to Milton's). Some, like us, would drive 20 minutes
