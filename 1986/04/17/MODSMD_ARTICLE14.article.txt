Beating highlights
need for standards
I was appalled to see that a Stan
ford student sustained serious injuries
in a confrontation with other students
after having attended Rush activities.
It is doubtless true that this was an
isolated incident, but it does point to
a disturbing trend that has been in
creasingly evident over the past few
weeks. The fraternity system has
come under heavy censure, and while
not all fraternities nor all members of
any one fraternity are implicated, the
overall picture is grim. Fraternities
are a problem, and one that must be
dealt with.
The University alcohol policy is ex
tremely liberal, for the California
drinking age is 21. and the fact that il
legal alcohol is so prominent
demonstrates a tolerance on the part
of authorities that is being consis
tently abused. The Office of Student
Affairs is not deliberately trying to
make students' lives miserable, but is
attempting to control a situation that
has gotten out of hand. Such control
is possible, as demonstrated by the
responsibility of a small number of
fraternities that are attempting to rec
tify the situation. The Sigma Phi Ep
silons should be congratulated on a
move that has restored my personal
faith in the fraternity system. That
members of certain fraternities have
been heard to remark that "dry rush - '

is intrinsically impossible, however,
points to the most fundamental prob
lem. Fraternities and sororities on
campus have become identified with
excessive drinking and irresponsible
behavior, and while the generaliza
tion may not be universally applica
ble, it nonetheless exists.
I urge all students to reevaluate
their outlook on the current debate
and encourage mature and intelligent
behavior. If fraternities are to remain
on campus, they must prove that they
are willing to adopt certain funda
mental standards of decency. Until
they are willing to do so, either indi
vidually or collectively, the Univer
sity ought to impose strict standards
hitherto not even contemplated in or
der to ensure that future incidents of
drunken violence are not associated
with a world-class academic institu
tion like Stanford.

Anti-labor stance
has long history
In his letter to Political Science
Prof. John Manley, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy criticizes Man
ley for failing to provide evidence
that Kennedy's administration is anti
labor.
If Kennedy really wants evidence. I

suggest that he re-read the last six
years of The Daily, that he contact
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) officials who charged his ad
ministration with seriously violating
labor law in 1984 and that he talk to
the reknowned labor law professor
(William Gould) on his own faculty
who has repeatedly written about
Stanford's destructive labor tactics.
However, if Kennedy really wants
evidence that his administration is
anti-labor I suggest that he check
with workers here. After all, if Ken
nedy's administration is anti-labor we
workers should know, because we
live under his labor policies every
day.
Stanford workers, in fact, have
made their view on this issue very
clear. In 1973, Stanford workers were
among the first in the nation to vote
for a large union at a university. We
did this, not because we were smarter
than workers at other universities,
but because Stanford management
was so bad we had to have a union for
protection. In 1984 Stanford workers
again voted for the union, but voted
for it by a much greater margin than
in 1973. That's because management
under the current Kennedy adminis
tration is much worse than manage
ment was in '73. And it is even
clearer that we have to have the un
ions for protection.
In his response to Manley, Ken
nedy tries to blame others for his
administration's policies. But the fact
is that Kennedy put his anti-labor at-

torney, Pricilla Wheeler, into her po
sition of authority as managing
attorney for labor, and he has kept
her in that position despite her ob
vious anti-labor tactics.
Sadly, the Kennedy administration
has damaged not only labor relations,
but the academic community as a
whole. This adminstration has
brought corporations and the profit
motive directly into academic re
search, has brought weapons research
to the Stanford Linear Accelerator,
and Star Wars research to campus.
It has attacked minority theme
houses, SWOPSI, graduate student
housing, has virtually eliminated af
firmative action and has supported
Stanford's investment stock in South
Africa because it is profitable. In
short, Kennedy's administration has
increasingly run the University like a
corporation and has effectively
destroyed the comparatively inde
pendent academic community that
existed here 10 years ago.
In his response to Manley, Kennedy
conveniently denied responsibility for
his adminstration's action. But when
he leaves Stanford, Kennedy will be
long remembered as the president
who "corporatized" the University.
A sad legacy, indeed.
Legacies, however, can be undone.
Hopefully, future Stanford faculty,
students and workers will be commit
ted to undoing the damage that the
Kennedy administration has done.
