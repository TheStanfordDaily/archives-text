## 'Bohemian Paris' traces roots of counterculture 
### ISAAC BARCHAS 
"Bohemian Paris: Culture, Politics
and the Boundaries of Political Life,
1830-1930"
By Jerrold Seigel
Go back a few years, way back,
past "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test," Berkeley and Woodstock. Past
Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs
and Allan Ginsberg. Keep going back
in time, looking for the roots of the
modern counterculture — from
today's punks and mods to yester
day's Impressionists — and you will
find Parisian Bohemia.
What was Bohemia? It was a con
centrated stew of youth, art, the un
derworld, sexual experimentation,
literature, drugs, politics and poverty
arising out of the French Revolution
and centered in Paris. "Its borders
were poverty and hope, art and illu
sion, love and shame, work, gaiety,
courage, slander, necessity and the
hospital .... To trace its frontiers
was to cross constantly back and forth
between reality and fantasy," writes
Jerrold Seigel in his attempt to define
Bohemia and chronicle its most active
century.
But Seigel's dissatisfaction with
such a vague definition of Bohemia
— more a listing of its characteristics
than a description of its nature — lies
at the core of "Bohemian Paris." He
tries to find the Bohemian essence by
placing Bohemia in a larger social and
economic context, and he carefully
backs up his analysis with anecdotes
and biographies of one of the most in
teresting times in modern history. Ul
timately, these enormously interest
ing and entertaining vignettes are
what make the book enjoyable and
worthwhile.
It is too easy to see the long hair,
radical politics and art of Bohemia as
utterly separate from staid, bourgeois

Paris. According to Seigel, Bohemia
was not separate from the bourgeois,
but rather a manifestation of it.
Bohemian couterculture served a ne
cessary function in French society: it
tested the boundaries of that society
and, due to its extremism, urged soci
ety into new and more democratic
politics and cultures. Moreover, it
provided a bleeder valve for the cul
tural and political pressures within
the post-Old Regime society. Seigel
writes, "Bohemia was a revelation of
tendencies nurtured by society as a
whole, as revolution and innovation
caused inherited structures and as
sumptions to give way." The individ
ual Bohemians used drugs, alcohol
and sex to explore personal dilemma;
in the same way, Seigel says, bour
geois society as a whole used
Bohemia to explore its own crises and
probe its own boundaries and direc
tions.
Ah, the individual Bohemians. Al
though uncertain of when Bohemian
life started — Seigel has as much
trouble finding the origins of
Bohemia as did the Parisians who
named the young artists after wan
dering Czechoslovakian gypsies —
Seigel presents with certainty its first
citizen and popularizer, Henry
Murger. Murger, a writer without
great talent, was the first to write
about Bohemia; Puccini's "La
Boheme" finds its basis in Murger's
then-famous autobiographical
writings. In his writings on Bohemian
life, Murger popularized the image of
the starving artist which persists to
this day. To Murger, Bohemia was an
apprentice shop for artists looking for
stimulation to creativity.
One such artist was Charles
Baudelaire. Both fascinated and
repelled by Bohemian squalor,
Baudelaire turned to drugs and alco
hol to inspire the creative distance
from which he worked. "The vision

ary possibilities of every form of in
toxication, alcohol, drugs, sexuality,
politics, had to be cultivated despite
the dangers to personal integrity they
posed and the inescapable loss of
control they brought in their wake,"
writes Seigel. Such Rabelaisian excess
not only gave Bohemia its distinctive
flavor, but also helped heighten the
connection between art and individ
ual experience, thus encouraging ar
tistic modernity.
After the Commune of 1871,
Bohemia changed from an artistic
gathering place and training ground
into a theater. The cabaret sprang up,
popularizing Bohemia and making it
accessible to those outside the circle
of true Bohemians. As cabaret art
and the newspapers which sur
rounded it fed one another, art was

gradually turned into a market com
modity, with the petit presse acting as
ad sheets for the new product. The
cabarets themselves became known
for their sensual indulgence and
Bohemia gradually became more vi
olent.
A typical anecdote of the time: "By
early November, Allan Verlaine (a
poet) was deep in drink, and appear
ing publicly with Arthur Rimbaud in
ways that made the nature of their at
tachment all too clear. He made vio
lent scenes with his wife, culminating
on the night of Jan. 13, 1872,
when he threw their son against a wall
(the baby was unhurt) and tried to
strangle Mathilde (his wife). That was
the beginning of the end of their mar
riage; he tried to set her hair on fire in
May and chased her around the table

with a knife in June. In July, Mathilde
went to Belgium, where Verlaiue was
living with Rimbaud, in an attempt to
bring him back. ..
Bohemia had changed dramati
cally. Aside from the political
changes that had taken place by 1871
and the demographic and architec
tural changes of the new Paris, Seigel
hints that Bohemia lent personality to
the scientific impersonalism of the
Third Republic. Fed up with
liberalism's cut-and-dried scientific
approach to life, the bourgeoisie
looked back with longing to the ages
of emotions and angers. Their vehicle
for this retrospection, ironically, was
Bohemia, the same Bohemia which
had provided their glimpses into the
political and artistic future.
Then, around the turn of the cen
tury, the character of Bohemia
changed again, in location as well as
in spirit. Montemartre and modern
art became, respectively, the physical
and intellectual centers of Bohemia,
its cast including artists and poets like
Picasso, Braque, Gis, Salmon, Jacob
and Apollinaire, who used art to blur
the divisions between real and unreal.
Bohemia became even more closely
linked with criminality and prostitu
tion, and began to dissolve. By 1922,
voices proclaimed the death of
Bohemia, but not before Stein,
Fitzgerald and Hemingway showed
up to breathe brief new life into the
dying lifestyle which, Seigel claims,
gave birth to Surrealism and Dadaism
before it expired around 1930.
Seigel attributes Bohemia's fall
largely to a shift in attitudes among
the young bourgeois who tradition
ally made up the counterculture. In
addition, as society became more
liberal, it usurped some of the terri
tory which had been Bohemia's own.
Finally, it cost a lot of money to be
Bohemian; Depression-era financial
responsibility played a large part in

the end of Bohemia's 100-year
reign in Paris.
Seigel gives us a fine look at the
early counterculture in "Bohemian
Paris." Unfortunately, his method of
approaching Bohemia — class analy
sis — though illuminating, proves in
appropriate to discussion of the sub
ject. Class analysis can be a useful
academic tool; too much concentra
tion on the individual can blind one to
the general trends and themes of his
tory. However, it can be an unwieldy
club with which to attack basically in
dividual phenomena, such as
Bohemianism. Seigel seems to set up
two level of analysis, one social and
one personal, both of which work
within their limitations. His attempts
to blend the two, however, recall the
Saturday morning cartoon character
who try to catch thousands of
raindrops from hundreds of holes in
the roof; it quickly becomes absurd.
His larger social analysis cannot con
tain the extraordinary individualism
which made Bohemia unique.
Perhaps Seigel trapped himself by
attempting to define Bohemia, which
does not readily lend itself to defini
tion. Any effort to define Bohemia
seems doomed to failure, as its char
acters and anecdotes burst through
any one classification. In a way, the
reader can glean far more informa
tion about Bohemia from Seigel's
biographies — Murger, Baudelaire,
Jarry, to name a few — than from his
analysis. It is unfortunate that Seigel
was unwilling or afraid to let the
biographies speak for themselves. In
a way, I find myself wishing that
Seigel had collaborated with Hunter
Thompson or Tom Wolfe or some
other American journalist with less
fear of glorifying individual excess.
The work would have been less schol
arly, but it might have given the
reader a better sense of the true
Bohemia.


Jerrold Seigel's exploration of the Bohemian underworld in Paris suf
fers from its somewhat scholarly focus.
