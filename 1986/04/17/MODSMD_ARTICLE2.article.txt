# Res Ed sends sanctuary warning
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education has
refused to waive its three-day limit on
house guests to allow Columbae House to
continue sheltering a Salvadoran refugee.
Columbae residents, however, say they
will continue to offer sanctuary to the
refugee, known only as Herman, and will
search actively for other residences that
will welcome him as well.
Residents at Casa Zapata, who are now
considering declaring their house a sanc
tuary for Central American refugees, have

allowed Herman to stay there for the last
three nights.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of the Row,
called Columbae's decision to provide
sanctuary an "obvious abrogation of the
guest policy."
"Stanford housing is for Stanford stu
dents only. .. . The Stanford guest policy
exists to allow for an occasional, very
short-term visit by friends or relatives,"
Conklin wrote Columbae residents.
Because Herman is seeking refuge in the
house, he is "not the same as a house
guest," Conklin said.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Stu

dent Affairs, added, "We just didn't see
any reason to make an exception (to the
guest policy) in this particular case."
Adding that those who house Herman
"run the risk of losing their own housing,"
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, said,
"I have nothing to add beyond what the
policy states. The University would have to
consider withdrawing their (the residents
of Columbae's) housing privileges, accord
ing to the Housing Agreement Policy."
Columbae residents have isslied a state
ment assessing their feelings and describ
ing how they will deal with the situation
created by Res Ed's denial of their request.
"Herman is welcome at Columbae and

remains our house guest indefinitely. Fur
thermore, we will actively work to find
other places for him to stay in order to ex
pand our outreach activities," they said in
the statement.
The outreach activities of Columbae are
directed at promoting "educational
publicity for sanctuary and the plight of
refugees," according to Chuck Meyer, a
Columbae resident assistant.
"We are continuing with tutoring in En
glish and helping Herman find work in the
community. I am glad that we are able to
help him and hope that we can continue
without any sanctions being brought down
upon us," Meyer said.
