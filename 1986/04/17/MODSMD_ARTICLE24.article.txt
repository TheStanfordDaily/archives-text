## Cardinal trounces Gaels 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
Dickens' famous lines, "It was the
best of times, it was the worst of
times," could well be applied to St.
Mary's 15-9, 15-7, 15-8 loss to the
Stanford volleyball team here last
night.
It was the best of times for a Gael
squad which improved in nearly all
statistical categories from an earlier
15-5, 15-2, 15-3 shellacking at the
hands of the Cardinal and held early
leads in all three games last night.
However, it was also the worst of
times, as St. Mary's dropped its 18th
California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association game out of 19 and con
tinued its struggle through its first
year of CI V A competition.
"I see improvement out of those
guys every time they play," Stanford
Co-Coach Don Shaw said of the
Gaels, who are in their first year of
varsity competition. "They've got a
couple pretty good players out
there."
"We played not bad," St. Mary's
Coach Eugene Glazenberg said. "I
guess we could play a little better.
This is our first year in the CIV A, and
this is the toughest league in the na
tion."
Despite coming out a little flat in
the first game and quickly falling be
hind 3-0, the Cardinal eventually
righted itself and took 10 out of the
next 1 1 points. The pattern was
repeated in the last two games, as the
Gaels would jump out to a quick lead
before succumbing to Stanford's
frontline firepower.
"I thought we were a little sloppy,"
Shaw said of his squad, which is com
ing off an emotional win over UC-
Santa Barbara Saturday and looking
forward to a rematch with No. 1 USC
this Saturday.
"It's kind of a bad attitude when
you realize you don't have to be at
your best to win the match," Shaw

continued. "This one is just a tough
one to play. It's just a natural let
down."
The nature of the opponent did al
low the Cardinal to give several
reserves playing time.
"The guys who came off the bench
carried us this game," Shaw said of
the quartet of Dan Parr, Brett
Monello, Brad Nelson and David
Johnson, who combined to hit over
.700. "It was a good opportunity for
some guys to play. They got to swing
at a few balls and did a good job."
With the Cardinal getting so much

bench support, many starters, includ
ing Chris Braun — who sat out the
last two games — took extended
breathers on the bench.
"We got to rest Braun, and he's
been hurting a little," Stanford's Jon
Root said.
"We didn't need his (Braun's) hit
ting so we decided to get some other
guys in there," Shaw said.
One starter who didn't rest was
Root. Root played all three games in
an encouraging outing for the injury
plagued outside hitter. The senior
tied Monello for game honors in kills

with 11 and also led all players with
28 digs.
'Tm spending a lot of time in the
training room," Root said after ap
plying a post-game icepack to his
right shouder. "It (the shoulder) feels
okay now. I played okay."
The Cardinal improves to 12-7 in
CIV A play and 14-7 overall and finds
itself solidly in fifth place in the con
ference and in strong contention for
an NCAA berth. Stanford dominated
the statistics, outhitting the Gaels
.375 to .147.
