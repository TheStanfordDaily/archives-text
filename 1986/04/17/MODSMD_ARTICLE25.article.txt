# NBA first-round playoff forecasts
## 
### 
Jack Nicholson, sitting in the
front row, was once overheard to
say on a CBS-televised NBA
playoff game, "This is the playoffs,
this is the playoffs."
In his usual big-screen swagger,
Jack was simply voicing what most
already knew and were in the
process of enjoying — a first
round game between the Los An
geles Lakers and the Portland
Trailblazers. Once again, the time
is right for Jack to contribute his
courtside perceptions.

Who will win? To adhere to the
theme of the obvious, it certainly
will not be the Chicago Bulls.
Saddled with the task of facing the
Boston Celtics, the Bulls have as
much chance of winning as a turtle
does of developing bipedalism.
The Celtics' frontline of Larry
Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert
Parish and Bill Walton is currently
the best in the NBA. Chicago
counters with Orlando Woolridge
and a couple other guys known
only to the Windy City. Michael
"Buy My Shoes" Jordan will no
doubt cause problems, but he will
have little support other than his
expensive hightops.
Prediction: Boston in a sweep.
About as surprising as the end to
" Rambo."

The Milwaukee-New Jersey se
ries is a buck of a different color.
New Jersey, led by the resurgent
Mike Gminski at center, has the
talent to match up with the Bucks.
Still, Milwaukee's depth will
prove to be the key difference as
long as third-string center Paul
Mokeski stays cemented to the
bench. If he ventures forth, well
Prediction: Milwaukee 3-2.
Final game will be decided by two.
On the surface, the Phila
delphia-Washington match
up could be intriguing — es
pecially with Philly center Moses
Malone out of action. But I will
mention one name and that should
suffice: Charles Barkley.
Selected for neither the 1984
Olympic Team nor the 1985-86
All-Star game, the Round Mound
of Rebound has recently estab
lished himself as the premier
power forward in the game.
Barkley will dominate.
Prediction: Philadelphia 3-1.
The Bullets' Jeff Malone (the
other guy) will score big.
The postseason square-off be
tween Detroit and Atlanta should
provide a lot of offensive
firewords. Dominique "The
Human Highlight Film" Wilkins
and Isiah "A Child Shall Lead
Them"' Thomas will alternate
spectacular theatrics. But in the
end, it will be the steady
boardwork of Detroit center Bill
Laimbeer that will swing the tide.
Prediction: Detroit 3-2. Don't
bet on it, though. Of course, 1
would. All right, so I'm uncertain
about this one.
