There is happiness in Mudville today.
For the first time in the history of
Stanford varsity women's softball, the
Cardinal won a league game.
After losing 2-1 in extra innings to
Arizona in the first game, Stanford —
behind the two-hit pitching of junior
Laura Buchanan — bounced back to
claim the second game 1-0, thus making
its mark in Cardinal softball history.
"We were ecstatic about this," Stan
ford Coach Kathy Lincoln said after
wards. "The kids just played tremen
dous."
The best kid of the afternoon was no
doubt Buchanan, who started and com
pleted both games, pitching a nine
hitter in the first game while recording a
shutout in the second.
In both games, Buchanan was consis
tently "getting ahead of hitters," ac
cording to Lincoln.
"She was smart, forcing them
(Arizona hitters) to hit the ball — let
ting the defense back her up," Lincoln
said
Behind was the ever-able infield
corps of second baseman Tish Peterson,
shortstop Lisa Buchanan and third
baseman Cathy Dominguez, all of whom
had fine defensive games, Lincoln said.
Offensively, the big numbers once

again were not prominent, but there
was a keen difference this time out —
clutch hitting.
"Arizona kept right in there. When
we had to, we pulled through," Lincoln
said.
The lone run in the second game was
scored by catcher Vija Brookshire, who
singled with one out in the first inning.
Brookshire advanced to second and
third on a wild pitch and a passed ball.
Dominguez brought Brookshire home
with a timely single.
The lead held, despite some nervous
moments in the bottom of the seventh
and final inning, when Arizona
stranded a runner at second after a
sharp line drive was gathered in by
Peterson for the last out.
"It (the confidence level) started with
Arizona State," Lincoln said."The
whole team pulled together and it
carried through to this game. Winning
is contagious.
"We have confidence that we can
win. We're on a roll. Who knows what
can happen now?" she added.
Stanford will take its historical win
ning streak into today's Western
Region tournament at the University of
the Pacific, where approximately 16
West Coast teams are slated to play.
The Cardinal is scheduled to play
U.S. International University, Califor
nia and New Mexico.
