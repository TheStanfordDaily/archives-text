### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
With basically just three-fifths of a
squad, the Stanford women's golf team
finished 10th out of 18 teams in the Lady
Sun Devil in Phoenix, which concluded
yesterday at the Anasazi Golf Course.
Stanford shot 306 as a team yesterday to
rise from 12th place in one of the most
challenging tournaments of the season.
The Cardinal ended up with a three-round
total of 931, finishing three strokes ahead
of New Mexico (which fell from fourth to
11th yesterday).
"We got solid performances from (Kay)
Cornelius, (Kathy) Kostas and (Julie) Car
michael." Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
said. "Kathleen McCarthy continues to
struggle, and we did not get much help
from our No. 5 player (Adrienne Gilmar
tin)."
Cornelius led the team yesterday and for
the tourney, as she shot a three-over-par
75 to end up at 228. Kostas stroked a 77 to
finish at 231, while Carmichael, the team's

No. 1 player, fired a 76 to close at 233.
McCarthy was hampered the last two
rounds by a torn muscle in her back she
suffered during Tuesday's warmups. She
managed to shoot an 82 despite the injury,
but still finished at a disappointing 245.
Gilmartin improved from an opening
round 89 to a 78 yesterday, but still wound
up poorly at 251.
"This tournament included nine of the
nation's top 10 teams," Baldwin said. "We
finished 10th with virtually no help from
our No. 4 and 5 players."
Second-ranked Florida simply
dominated the tournament, winning by a
whopping 21 strokes over USC (883-904).
The Gators, which trailed the Trojans by
two strokes Monday, shot a one-under-par
287 Tuesday before shooting 294 yester
day to coast to the victory.
"Florida definitely established itself as
the No. 1 team in the country," Baldwin
said.
