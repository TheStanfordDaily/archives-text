# McDowell turning up the heat
## Fireballer brings intensity, talent to Stanford pitching staff 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Intense competitiveness. It's the attitude that
makes good athletes into great ones.
Jack McDowell has it.
"He is probably the most competitive person
on the team," infielder Paul Marca said. "His
competitive spirit is so visible that his
teammates will get into the game. People want
to play behind him."
"His attitude is great â€” every hitter he wants
to get out," catcher John Ramos said. "Every
hitter is a personal challenge to him. You don't
find that in many pitchers."
McDowell, bolstered by this competitive
spirit, entered Stanford in 1984 as a top
prospect and has disappointed no one, produc
ing remarkable results in his two-year stay on
the Farm. He has a 9-2 record this season.
McDowell was a hitter's nightmare in high
school.
Attending Notre Dame High School in Sher
man Oaks, the No. 1-ranked high school team
in the nation according to USA Today,
McDowell was a perfect 10-0 with an 0.30
earned run average in his senior year. He was
selected as the San Fernando Valley Player of
the Year and CIF 4-A Player of the Year.
These results prompted the Boston Red Sox
to draft McDowell out of high school in the
20th round and offer him an $80,000 package
to turn professional. McDowell said he never
really considered taking the offer.
During the summer of 1984, McDowell was
a member of the U.S. Junior Baseball team. He
helped the United States to a silver-medal
finish in the World Youth Baseball Champion
ship in Canada. McDowell was 3-0 in the
tournament with an 0.67 ERA. He was named
the tournament's co-Most Valuable Player.
Then, McDowell took Stanford by storm.
Joining a veteran team that was top-ranked
for much of the season last year, McDowell was
able to move right into the starting rotation. He
finished at 11-4 with a 4.15 ERA, recording
Stanford's lone win at the College World Se
ries. McDowell was an honorable mention All -
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division pick
and was selected as co-Freshman of the Year
by Baseball America.
McDowell has brought the intensity he dem
onstrated in high school with him to college.
"It was a tough mental adjustment, more so
than physical," McDowell said. "I had the tal
ent, but it was just gaining the confidence to
put my game together."
Last summer, McDowell competed on the
U.S. National team which traveled to Japan,
Korea and Canada. International competition
proved to improve his pitching skills.
"The competition is great," McDowell said.
"It's a different type of game. It really tests
your skill when you compete against different
nations."
Despite his accomplishments, McDowell was
just a freshman in 1985 on a predominantly
older team. This season proved to be an even
better measure of his talent.
"Last year I kind of took a back seat: I was
just happy to win my game on Sunday,"

McDowell said. "This year I figured I would be
the No. 1 pitcher and being the No. I pitcher
puts you in a leadership role."
This season, McDowell has dominated.
His 93 strikeouts in 92.3 innings pitched and
his 9-2 record speak for themselves. In Six-Pac
play, McDowell is 5-1 with a 2.21 ERA.
He has improved since last season.
"There are pitchers strikes and then there
are hitter's strikes," McDowell said. "One of
the main differences between this year and last
year is that my control is better this year within
the strike zone."
McDowell's 93 strikeouts this season give
him a good shot at breaking the Stanford

season strikeout record ot 144 set by Steve
Dunning in 1970.
"There are not many college pitchers better
than Jack,"' Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "He is one of the best around."
With most Six-Pac games played in three
game series, the ability to win the first game
and set a tone for the remainder of the series is
important. McDowell, starting the first game of
every series, has five of the Cardinal's I 1 Pac
-10 wins. He is a commanding presence on the
mound.
"It's nice to have a guy as consistent as he is
out there," outfielder Walt Harris said.
"Everyone is pretty confident, with Jack on the

mound, of our chances of winning."
"He is the ace of our staff,"
Marquess said. "Winning the first
game of a series is important, and he
has done that this year. That is a real
plus."
Only a sophomore, McDowell is

well ahead of the pace needed to
break Jeff Ballard's Stanford career
records for wins (37), strikeouts
(315) and innings pitched (428).
McDowell has 20 career wins, 181
career strikeouts and has pitched 220
innings in his brief career.
"My strength is definitely my
fastball," McDowell said. "It is the
basis for any good pitcher, throwing
the ball hard."
In addition to winning games,

McDowell motivates others to play
with the same intensity he displays.
"He pumps up the players,"
Ramos said. "It really excites him to
get guys out. The other guys look up
to Jack."
McDowell is constantly working to
improve his game. In fall baseball, he
developed a slider to go with his
fastball and split-fingered fastball.
"I am getting close to where I want
to be," McDowell said. "I just want

to keep improving and keep strong."
Like any college baseball player,
the possibility of leaving school after
his junior year for the professional
ranks exists for McDowell. He will
certainly be drafted and is highly re
garded by professional scouts.
"It's tough to say," McDowell said.
"It depends on what round I'm
drafted in and how much I'm offered.
All that has to be weighed against
completing a Stanford education."
