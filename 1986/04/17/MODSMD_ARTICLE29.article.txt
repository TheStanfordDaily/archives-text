# Top-ranked netters wary of upset-minded USIU
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Ordinarily, a team with a 14-12 record would present
very few problems for the nation's No. 1-ranked team.
When the women s tennis team from U.S. International
University visits Stanford today for a 1:30 p.m. match,
however, the top-ranked Cardinal will be battling a team
with upset on its mind.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan, for one, is scared.
We re nervous, he said. "They've beaten some pretty
good teams."
Brennan is not the only one who realizes that USIU is
better than its mediocre won-lost percentage. In the most
recent NCAA rankings, the Gulls were slated as the No.
12 team in the nation.
The word "international" in the university's name is
rather appropriate for this year's USIU team. Israel's Kefi
Binyamini plays at No. 1 singles for the Gulls and has
compiled a 18-17 record this season. At No. 2 singles for
USIU is Canada's Sylvie Tetreault, who is 21-15 thus far.
The worldy flavor of the USIU team continues down
the ladder with the likes of Elizma Nortje and Bettina
Wieneke at the No. 3 and 4 singles spots. Nortje is 21-11
on the season, and Wieneke has recorded 19 victories
while dropping 17 matches.
The international apsect is more than just an interesting
sidelight. It presents a unique problem for the Cardinal
with regards to scouting the Gulls.

When Stanford plays USC or UCLA, the individual
players on each team know each other well, having played
against one another throughout their early years.
When playing one of the foreign athletes on the USIU
team, however, "it's a little bit of a question mark," ac
cording to Brennan. "It's not a girl you've grown up with
in the juniors."
In addition to the problem presented by the Gulls' un
publicized talent, the Cardinal is not 100 percent physi
cally. Sophomore Kay Tittle, 13-1 on the season, will not
play at No. 5 singles today due to an ailing knee.
"It's just a gamble we'll have to take," Brennan said of
not playing Tittle. "It may cost us the match, but we have
to have her for USC (Saturday)."
Freshman Eleni Rossides, 4-1 at No. 2 singles prior to
coming up with shin splints in both legs in early March,
will not play today or Saturday. "It's a definite no," Bren
nan said. "We're hoping now for the NCAAs (May 15-
23)."
Those members of the Cardinal team who are physi
cally ready to go have lost valuable practice time this week
to Mother Nature. "I would feel better if we had gotten
together the past few days," Brennan said. "I have a
feeling we'll have some shaky first sets."
Playing in place of Rossides and Tittle will be sopho
more Cari Hagey and freshman Sonya Kazazian. Hagey
has consistently been victorious in Rossides' absence, ac
cumulating a 6-1 singles record. Kazazian is 2-0 in a lim
ited role this season.
