# Yost nixes focus plan
## students say no to Res Ed 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
The University yesterday canceled plans to launch a
Latin American/Iberian focus program in Yost House
next year after students and resident fellows there voiced
strong disapproval of the plan.
The "focus house" experiment would have been a resi
dential structure halfway between that of a regular dor
mitory, with no special theme, and that of a theme house,
according to Asst. Dean of Residential Education Alice
Supton.
However, Supton said strong negative reaction from
residents "made it difficult" to go ahead with the program
at Yost.
Supton said the University lacked sufficient time before
the Draw to inform students about the focus program or
to build a consensus among Yost residents.
Adams House residents will meet now to consider a Res
Ed proposal for a human biology focus at their residence
next year, and Supton said she would abide by the resi
dents' wishes.
"If students support it, we'll go with it," Supton said.
"We'll have to sense at the meeting whether to go ahead
or not."
At a meeting with Supton last week, Yost residents ex
pressed interest in the Latin American/Iberian focus, but
voiced strong opposition to the structure of the program,
especially to the "focus house" label and the plan to
reserve rooms in the house for "priority students" inter
ested in the focus.
Fifty of the 60 Yost residents — plus current Resident
Fellow Miguel Mendez and 1986-87 RF Edmundo Fuen
zalida — reiterated the concerns in a letter to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons Monday, saying that the
"focus house" label would distort the character of Yost
House.
"Students easily misunderstand labels such as 'focus'
and 'theme,' " they wrote. "The labels imply a specific
commitment to the house. .. . The labels thereby limit the
interest in Yost to those who specifically concern them
selves with the Latin American/Iberian culture."
In the letter, the students and resident fellows argued
that by offering special priorities to students already inter
ested in the focus. Res Ed would be limiting the house's
ability to introduce unexposed students to the focus.
Students already interested in the focus "would bring
with them preconceptions about a culture which may be
detrimental to extending one's cultural awareness," they
said.
Supton had proposed that up to 20
percent of the spaces in Yost go to
students interested in the Latin
American/Iberian focus.
Students also complained that the
focus plan could cause a split among
house residents.
"Non-priority students . . . will
have the ideas (for the focus)
imposed on them by others, creating
a schism among the residents of the
house," they wrote.
Supton said that although Yost will
not have the "focus" label, Latin
American/Iberian programs will be
conducted at the house.
" There definitely will be an excit
ing emphasis on Latin Ameri
can/Iberian life, culture, politics and
society," Supton said. "Edmundo will
be sparking the creative imagination
of the Yost residents."
Supton said she hopes Yost resi
dents will organize a theme or focus
house proposal of their own.
