Republicans maneuver on contras
WASHINGTON — House Republicans used a surprise tactic yester
day to abruptly stop House consideration of President Reagan's $100
million Nicaraguan aid proposal, saying they wanted to divorce it from
an unrelated spending bill Reagan badly wants to veto.
Democrats claimed the Republicans acted out of desperation because
they did not have the votes to defeat a key proposal opposed by the
White House. Both sides agreed the issue of contra aid is not dead and
will resurface, perhaps under different ground rules, within a few weeks.
The Republican minority pulled its surprise by voitng for an amend
ment that would have ended the Reagan program of aiding the anti-
Sandinista guerillas in Nicaragua — an amendment that had been widely
expected to fail.
As a consequence, the amendment by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.)
passed 361 -66 with only one Republican opposing it. It would bar all aid
to the contras while making $27 million available for Nicaraguan
refugees.
The unexpected ploy, which blocked consideration of an amendment
opposed by the White House, was characterized by GOP leader as a
move to free the aid plan from a $1.7 billion catch-all spending bill
Reagan says is "pork barrel" lesislation "brimming with waste and
excess."
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill Jr. immediately withdrew the aid plan
from consideration temporarily.
"When you have a rotten rule to play by you are forced to take uncon
ventional action," said House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois,
who called the procedure under which the House was operating a "sham
charade."
The Democratic ground rules, he said, were, "a variation of the old
con game, heads I win, tail you lose."
"You in the majority leadership who thought you could ignore the
plight of democracy in Nicaragua by turning this debate into one in
which we had to choose between aid to the Contras and a supplemental
appropriations bill loaded with goodies," said Michel. "I have to say
again we just can't play that game."
The Republican tactic prevented the House from voting on an amend
ment by Rep. Daivd McCurdy (D-Okla.) — opposed by the White
House — that would delay all military aid to the contras and require
direct negotiations between the United States and Nicaragua's Sandi
nista government. It also would require another affirmative vote by both
houses to free the money for arms.
Michel outlined a complicated procedure to revive the Reagan plan,
unencumbered by being attached to the spending bill and O'Neill said he
had given his word to Democrats that there would be a vote on the
McCurdy amendment.
O'Neill later sent world to reporters that he would permit the aid plan
and amendments to it to be offered in the normal manner, perhaps as a
rider to the defense appropriations bill which is expected to reach the
House floor sometime in May.
F-11l still missing
WASHINGTON — Military commanders at the Pentagon are
actively investigating the possibility that the F-11l bomber missing from
this week's aerial raids on Libya may have droped a bomb off-target
after being hit by anti-aircraft fire, Administration sources said yester
day.
The search for an answer to what happened to the F-11l has been
complicated by incomplete reports from other American pilots engaged
in the pre-dawn raid and the inability of Navy searchers to locate any
sign of the missing plane, the sources said.
Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
the search for the two missing crewmen had been called off after Navy
planes and ships failed to find any trace of the men or their aircraft.
The Administration sources, who agreed to discuss the matter only if
not identified, said the Pentagon had not ruled out the possibility that
the missing F-11l never made it back out to sea after its bombing run.
U.S. scolds Soviets
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration — asserting "We're
not trying to assassinate" Moammar Khadafy — said yesterday that the
American raid on Libya could have been avoided if the Soviet Union
had heeded requests to "restrain the Libyans" from anti-American ter
rorism.
Confronted with diplomatic criticism of the raids, the Administration
said that if the Soviets had acted on its pleas, authorities might have been
able to foil the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque, which killed an
American serviceman and a Turkish woman and wounded some 200
others.
State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the Soviets also were
warned that supplying SA-5 missiles might encourage Khadafy to "take
risks which would force us to respond. This in fact turned out to be the
case."
Socialite Guinness freed
DUBLIN, Ireland — Police and soldiers surrounded a hideout and
rescued Jennifer Guinness at dawn yesterday. The Dublin socialite said
she had hidden a car jack under her pillow, hoping for a chance to hit
one of her kidnappers.
The three men who held her surrendered peacefully after six hours of
negotiations at the house in Dublin, police said.
Guinness, the petite 48-year-old wife of merchant banker John
Guinness, looked none the worse for her eight-day ordeal when she ap
peared at a news conference. Police praised her coolness and courage.
She said the three masked men who seized her at herclifftop mansion
April 8 put her in the trunk of their car. She slipped the jack inside her
coat and later hid it under the pillow of the bed on which she was forced
to spend most of her time in captivity.
When the gang discovered the jack after two days, she said, the leader
"was absolutely hopping mad and 1 was so pleased. I really felt great
about it."
She said she tried to persuade her captors that they had grabbed the
wrong girl. Seeing television coverage of the family's lavish lifestyle a
member of the gang burst into her room shouting: "You're worth mil
lions!"
The Guinness family is one of Ireland's richest, with branches in
brewing and banking.
Police Superintendent Frank Hanlon said the ransom of 2 million Irish
pounds ($2.6 million) that the kidnappers demanded was not paid.
U.S. citizens in Sudan warned
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration yesterday prepared
to withdraw large numbers of Americans from Sudan because of the
shooting of a U.S. embassy employee in the capital city of Khartoum,
massive anti-American demonstrations and "life threatening" terrorists.
The State Department upgraded a previous travel advisory for the
city, saying "due to the presence in Khartoum of terrorists posing life
threatening dangers to U.S. citizens, Americans should not travel to the
Sudanese capital of Khartoum."'
The previous advisory mentioned dangers, but did not say they were
"life threatening."
There are about 200 American officials in Sudan and an equal number
of dependents, plus about 700 other Americans in Khartoum.
Earlier, anther official rejected the notion that the embassy would be
closed, saying, "we're not going to let terrorists push us out of a
country."

to withdraw large numbers of Americans from Sudan because of the
shooting of a U.S. embassy employee in the capital city of Khartoum,
massive anti-American demonstrations and "life threatening" terrorists.
The State Department upgraded a previous travel advisory for the
city, saying "due to the presence in Khartoum of terrorists posing life
threatening dangers to U.S. citizens, Americans should not travel to the
Sudanese capital of Khartoum."'
The previous advisory mentioned dangers, but did not say they were
"life threatening."
There are about 200 American officials in Sudan and an equal number
of dependents, plus about 700 other Americans in Khartoum.
Earlier, anther official rejected the notion that the embassy would be
closed, saying, "we're not going to let terrorists push us out of a
country."
Republicans maneuver on contras
WASHINGTON — House Republicans used a surprise tactic yester
day to abruptly stop House consideration of President Reagan's $100
million Nicaraguan aid proposal, saying they wanted to divorce it from
an unrelated spending bill Reagan badly wants to veto.
Democrats claimed the Republicans acted out of desperation because
they did not have the votes to defeat a key proposal opposed by the
White House. Both sides agreed the issue of contra aid is not dead and
will resurface, perhaps under different ground rules, within a few weeks.
The Republican minority pulled its surprise by voitng for an amend
ment that would have ended the Reagan program of aiding the anti-
Sandinista guerillas in Nicaragua — an amendment that had been widely
expected to fail.
As a consequence, the amendment by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.)
passed 361 -66 with only one Republican opposing it. It would bar all aid
to the contras while making $27 million available for Nicaraguan
refugees.
The unexpected ploy, which blocked consideration of an amendment
opposed by the White House, was characterized by GOP leader as a
move to free the aid plan from a $1.7 billion catch-all spending bill
Reagan says is "pork barrel" lesislation "brimming with waste and
excess."
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill Jr. immediately withdrew the aid plan
from consideration temporarily.
"When you have a rotten rule to play by you are forced to take uncon
ventional action," said House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois,
who called the procedure under which the House was operating a "sham
charade."
The Democratic ground rules, he said, were, "a variation of the old
con game, heads I win, tail you lose."
"You in the majority leadership who thought you could ignore the
plight of democracy in Nicaragua by turning this debate into one in
which we had to choose between aid to the Contras and a supplemental
appropriations bill loaded with goodies," said Michel. "I have to say
again we just can't play that game."
The Republican tactic prevented the House from voting on an amend
ment by Rep. Daivd McCurdy (D-Okla.) — opposed by the White
House — that would delay all military aid to the contras and require
direct negotiations between the United States and Nicaragua's Sandi
nista government. It also would require another affirmative vote by both
houses to free the money for arms.
Michel outlined a complicated procedure to revive the Reagan plan,
unencumbered by being attached to the spending bill and O'Neill said he
had given his word to Democrats that there would be a vote on the
McCurdy amendment.
O'Neill later sent world to reporters that he would permit the aid plan
and amendments to it to be offered in the normal manner, perhaps as a
rider to the defense appropriations bill which is expected to reach the
House floor sometime in May.
F-11l still missing
WASHINGTON — Military commanders at the Pentagon are
actively investigating the possibility that the F-11l bomber missing from
this week's aerial raids on Libya may have droped a bomb off-target
after being hit by anti-aircraft fire, Administration sources said yester
day.
The search for an answer to what happened to the F-11l has been
complicated by incomplete reports from other American pilots engaged
in the pre-dawn raid and the inability of Navy searchers to locate any
sign of the missing plane, the sources said.
Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
the search for the two missing crewmen had been called off after Navy
planes and ships failed to find any trace of the men or their aircraft.
The Administration sources, who agreed to discuss the matter only if
not identified, said the Pentagon had not ruled out the possibility that
the missing F-11l never made it back out to sea after its bombing run.
U.S. scolds Soviets
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration — asserting "We're
not trying to assassinate" Moammar Khadafy — said yesterday that the
American raid on Libya could have been avoided if the Soviet Union
had heeded requests to "restrain the Libyans" from anti-American ter
rorism.
Confronted with diplomatic criticism of the raids, the Administration
said that if the Soviets had acted on its pleas, authorities might have been
able to foil the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque, which killed an
American serviceman and a Turkish woman and wounded some 200
others.
State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the Soviets also were
warned that supplying SA-5 missiles might encourage Khadafy to "take
risks which would force us to respond. This in fact turned out to be the
case."
Socialite Guinness freed
DUBLIN, Ireland — Police and soldiers surrounded a hideout and
rescued Jennifer Guinness at dawn yesterday. The Dublin socialite said
she had hidden a car jack under her pillow, hoping for a chance to hit
one of her kidnappers.
The three men who held her surrendered peacefully after six hours of
negotiations at the house in Dublin, police said.
Guinness, the petite 48-year-old wife of merchant banker John
Guinness, looked none the worse for her eight-day ordeal when she ap
peared at a news conference. Police praised her coolness and courage.
She said the three masked men who seized her at herclifftop mansion
April 8 put her in the trunk of their car. She slipped the jack inside her
coat and later hid it under the pillow of the bed on which she was forced
to spend most of her time in captivity.
When the gang discovered the jack after two days, she said, the leader
"was absolutely hopping mad and 1 was so pleased. I really felt great
about it."
She said she tried to persuade her captors that they had grabbed the
wrong girl. Seeing television coverage of the family's lavish lifestyle a
member of the gang burst into her room shouting: "You're worth mil
lions!"
The Guinness family is one of Ireland's richest, with branches in
brewing and banking.
Police Superintendent Frank Hanlon said the ransom of 2 million Irish
pounds ($2.6 million) that the kidnappers demanded was not paid.
