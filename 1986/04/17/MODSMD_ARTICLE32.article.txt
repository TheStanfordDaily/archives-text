# Khadafy reappears, blasts U.S.

### 
TRIPOLI, Libya — Moammar Khadafy
emerged from two days' seclusion late yesterday,
condemned the United States for its air attack on
Libya and vowed that his people are ready to fight
on and die.
But the Libyan leader, whose baby daughter was
reported killed in the raid, told Americans, "We
will not kill your children. We are not like you, we
do not bombard cities."
Khadafy's appearance on Libyan television,
during which he disclaimed responsibility for anti-
American terror attacks, dispelled speculation he
had left the country or been killed or seriously
injured in the Tuesday morning air raid, staged by
waves of U.S. warplanes that dumped one bomb
just 10 yards from the Khadafy residence in his
fortress headquarters here.
Earlier last night, anti-aircraft fire streaked the
black skies over this seaside capital for a second
day and gunfire ricocheted around the
headquarters compound. Government officials
denied the street gunfire signaled factional fighting
among the Libyans.

Anti-aircraft crews first opened up in mid
afternoon yesterday at what officials said was a
high-flying U.S. reconnaisance jet. A Washington
source acknowledged that reconnaisance planes
had flown over this north African nation.
The Libyans also said there were new U.S. air at
tacks yesterday against Tripoli and towns south and
east of here. But the Pentagon denied it, and
reporters here found no signs of new bombard
ments.
For almost two full days after the damaging U.S.
air bombardment of Tripoli, Khadafy had
remained out of sight. Earlier yesterday, he failed
to appear for a promised meeting with journalists
at his headquarters.
Then, at 11:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. EST), the Libyan
leader appeared on state television, dressed in a
white army uniform and speaking in a studio with a
map of Africa behind him.
"We are ready to die and we are ready to carry
on fighting and defending our country," he
declared, speaking in Arabic.
He said President Reagan "has issued orders to

his armed forces to kill our children. We have not
issued any orders to murder anybody."
The attacks, which the United States said were
targeted on five security and military installations
in Tripoli and the eastern Libyan city ot Benghazi,
also severely damaged a civilian neighborhood in
Tripoli. Western diplomats said at least 100 people,
and probably many more, were killed in Tripoli.
Doctors said Khadafy's 15-month-old adopted
daughter, Hana, was among the dead, and his two
sons, aged 4 and 3-1/2, were seriously injured.
Khadafy said Reagan "should be put on trial as a
war criminal and murderer of children."
Prior to Khadafy's public appearance, the
Reagan Administration yesterday had received in
telligence indicating that Khadafy had fled his
Tripoli headquarters and gone into the Libyan des
ert, government sources said.
Speculation of a coup in Libya moved through
Washington, and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said reports of gunfire in Tripoli could
indicate that "there may well be some people...who
are trying to take matters into their own hands.
