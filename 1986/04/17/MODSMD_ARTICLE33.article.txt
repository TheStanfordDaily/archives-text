# Court rules for right to die
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — A state ap
peals panel yesterday ordered a
county hospital to stop force-feeding
a paralyzed woman who tried to
starve herself to death two years ago.
Doctors caring for 28-year-old
Elizabeth Bouvia had insisted on in
serting a feeding tube last January,
saying her weight had dropped and
they worried she was trying to com
mit suicide.
However, the unamimous, force
fully worded opinion by the 2nd Ap
pellate Court said a patient has the

right to refuse medical treatment —
even if it is life-sustaining.
"She has a right to refuse the in
creased dehumanizing aspects of her
condition created by the insertion of a
permanent tube through her nose and
into her stomach," wrote Associate
Justice Edwin Beach.
A concurring opinion, written by
Associate Justice Lynn Compton, was
far more impassioned.
"Whatever choice Elizabeth
Bouvia may ultimately make, I can
only hope that her courage, persis
tence and example will cause our

soicety to deal realistically with the
plight of those unfortunate individ
uals to whom death beckons as a
welcome respite from suffering,"
Compton wrote.
"If there is ever a time when we
ought to be able to get the
'government off our backs' it is when
we face death — either by choice or
otherwise."
Bouvia, who is unable to care for
herself, has been living since last
December at the county-operated
High Desert Hospital in Lancaster,
about 50 miles north of Los Angeles.

A quadriplegic, she has had cerebral
palsy since birth and also suffers from
progressive arthritis.
Her unsuccessful court battle to be
allowed to starve herself while under
care at a Riverside County hospital
two years ago was highly publicized.
She says she now is willing to take liq
uid nourishment, although solid food
makes her nauseous.
Steve Carnevale, a deputy Lost
Angeles County counselor, said he
wasn't sure if the case would be ap
pealed.
