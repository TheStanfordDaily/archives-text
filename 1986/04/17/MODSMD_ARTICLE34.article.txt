Cronkite may blast off
COLUMBIA, S.C. — One hundred jour
nalists, including CBS correspondent Walter
Cronkite and free-lance reporter Geraldo
Rivera, were announced yesterday as semi
finalists in the race to become the first reporter to
ride the space shuttle.
Officials with the Journalist-in-Space project
released the names of the 100 semfnnalists in an
afternoon news conferance.
The semifinalists still face three more selection
panels and their space flight cannot be scheduled
until the outcome of a Presidential commission's
investigation of the Jan. 28 explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger.
The semifinalists are separated into five
regions, with 20 journalists from each region.
The 100 were selected from a group of 1,703 ap
plicants which included reporters, editors, colum
nists, news directors, anchormen and a photogra
pher.
The 100 regional nominees include 37 appli
cants from newspapers, 36 from the broadcast
media, 12 from magazines, four from wire
services and 11 free-lance journalists.
3,500 fugitives captured
SAN DIEGO — More than 3,500 criminals
were arrested in the western United States and

Mexico during an eight-week operation that
sometimes played on the greed of the fugitives to
return them to custody, officials said yesterday.
The arrest effort was headed by the U.S. Mar
shal's Service, which deputized local, state, and
federal officials from 34 agencies to serve war
rants as part of a Fugitive Investigative Strike
Team, the ninth such operation in the last four
years.
Stanley Morris, director of the marshal's ser
vice, said the manhunt operated from Phoenix
and Tuscon, Ariz.; San Diego; Albuquerque,
N.M.; El Paso, San Antonio, Mc Allen and Hous
ton, Texas; and the Mexican cities of Tijuana,
Nogales, Juarez, Matamoros and Mexico City.
"There are more fugitives on the streets of this
country than there are locked up in jail," Morris
said in a news conference announcing the results
of FIST 9.
More than $130 million in narcotics and other
contraband was seized during FIST 9, including
865 pounds of cocaine in the back of a truck
driven by one of the fugitives arrested in El Paso,
Morris said.
Old volcano emits ash
VANCOUVER, Wash. — Mount St. Helens
spewed a plume of ash and steam up to 25,000
feet yesterday evening, the first eruptive activity
at the volcano in about 10 months.

Geologist Richard Waitt of the U.S. Geologi
cal Survey called it a gas and ash emission, but
said it was not classified an eruption because the
mountain was not producing lava or spitting out
large amounts of stones or ash.
A plume of gas with some ash in it rose to
20,000 to 25,000 feet above sea level at about
5:15 p.m. PST, Waitt said.
"This does not mean an eruption is going on.
Steam and ash plumes used to be fairly common
at Mount St. Helens." said Jim Zolig, a seis
mologist with the UCGS in Seattle.
Small earthquakes were detected by monitor
ing equipmernt earlier yesterday, and the emis
sion was accompanied by a "modest seismic
event,"the University of Washington said.
