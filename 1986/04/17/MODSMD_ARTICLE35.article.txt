' Night Stalker' named
LOS ANGELES — A witness testifying yes
terday under a grant of immunity linked Richard
Ramirez to key "Night Stalker" evidence, includ
ing stolen jewelry, a pentagram and a hat with
the logo AC-DC.
Felipe Solano, who admitted he frequently
bought stolen goods from Ramirez, also placed
the murder defendant in the San Francisco area
about the time a Night Stalker murder was com
mitted there.
Solano, 53, a gray-haired, Spanish-speaking
man who testified through a translator, said he
knew Ramirez by the name Ricardo Moreno and
did not learn his true identity until he was ar
rested and charged with multiple murders.
"He told me he could bring me things that 1
wanted," Solano said of his relationship with
Ramirez, which began in December 1984 and
lasted until the arrest in late August 1985.
Ramirez in accused of 14 murders and 54
other felonies in the string of attacks that ter
rorized widely scattered areas of the state last
summer. Municipal Court Judge James Nelson
will determine at the close of the preliminary
hearing whether Ramirez must stand trial on the
charges.
The witness said his only crime was receiving
stolen goods. During the lunch recess, the prose
cutor obtained a grant of immunity to free him
from the threat of possible prosecution for his
role.
Solano said he last saw Ramirez three days
before his arrest when Ramirez asked him for
money so he could leave the state. He said
Ramirez had a handgun.
Solano's testimony came on a day when the
judge, noting the hearing might end sooner than

expected, also heard testimony about the dis
covery of a brutally beaten woman handcuffed to
a door in the house where her husband lay mur
dered.
Oakland sues Raiders
OAKLAND — Oakland has decided to take
its six-year court battle over the Raiders football
team to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The city council voted 6-3 Tuesday night to
keep fighting for the team, which moved to Los
Angeles.
Oakland will file its request for a hearing
before the court next month, said David Self, the
city attorney handling the case.
The city contends it has the right to take over
the team under state law that allows cities to ac
quire private property for public use. It has spent
$1.2 million on the eminent domain case since it
started its legal fight in 1980, the year the
Raiders' owners said they were moving to Los
Angeles.
A lower court found that Oakland's attempts
to use its eminent domain powers to get the team
back would be unconstitutional because it would
interfere with the National Football League's
right to engage in interstate commerce. The state
Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
If the U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the
case and rules in favor of Oakland, the matter
would then return to California courts.
Oakland has "everything to gain and ex
tremely little to lose" by appealing the case. Self
said.
Mayor Lionel Wilson announced the council
decision following an executive session in his of

fice. The decision later was ratified by the council
in a public session.
Californians are happy
SAN FRANCISCO— Eighty-nine percent of
adults in California are either "very happy" or
"pretty happy," an increase of 12 percent in two
years, according to a new California poll.
The poll was conducted among 1,008 adults
between March 17 and March 26. The margin of
error was not immediately available.
In 1983, 25 percent said they were very happy,
52 percent said they were pretty happy and 22
percent said they were not too happy. In 1986,
however, 35 percent said they were very happy,
54 percent were pretty happy and only 11 per
cent were not too happy.
The poll found no significant differences in the
degree to which men and women described their
state of happiness. There were also no major dif
ferences among age groups as far as happiness
goes.
Not surprisingly, married people were des
cribed as significantly happier than those who
were divorced, widowed or separating. People
with low incomes are also less inclined to say that
they are happy compared to upper income re
spondents.

about the time a Night Stalker murder was com
mitted there.
Solano, 53, a gray-haired, Spanish-speaking
man who testified through a translator, said he
knew Ramirez by the name Ricardo Moreno and
did not learn his true identity until he was ar
rested and charged with multiple murders.
"He told me he could bring me things that 1
wanted," Solano said of his relationship with
Ramirez, which began in December 1984 and
lasted until the arrest in late August 1985.
Ramirez in accused of 14 murders and 54
other felonies in the string of attacks that ter
rorized widely scattered areas of the state last
summer. Municipal Court Judge James Nelson
will determine at the close of the preliminary
hearing whether Ramirez must stand trial on the
charges.
The witness said his only crime was receiving
stolen goods. During the lunch recess, the prose
cutor obtained a grant of immunity to free him
from the threat of possible prosecution for his
role.
Solano said he last saw Ramirez three days
before his arrest when Ramirez asked him for
money so he could leave the state. He said
Ramirez had a handgun.
Solano's testimony came on a day when the
judge, noting the hearing might end sooner than

expected, also heard testimony about the dis
covery of a brutally beaten woman handcuffed to
a door in the house where her husband lay mur
dered.
Oakland sues Raiders
OAKLAND — Oakland has decided to take
its six-year court battle over the Raiders football
team to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The city council voted 6-3 Tuesday night to
keep fighting for the team, which moved to Los
Angeles.
Oakland will file its request for a hearing
before the court next month, said David Self, the
city attorney handling the case.
The city contends it has the right to take over
the team under state law that allows cities to ac
quire private property for public use. It has spent
$1.2 million on the eminent domain case since it
started its legal fight in 1980, the year the
Raiders' owners said they were moving to Los
Angeles.
A lower court found that Oakland's attempts
to use its eminent domain powers to get the team
back would be unconstitutional because it would
interfere with the National Football League's
right to engage in interstate commerce. The state
Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
If the U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the
case and rules in favor of Oakland, the matter
would then return to California courts.
Oakland has "everything to gain and ex
tremely little to lose" by appealing the case. Self
said.
Mayor Lionel Wilson announced the council
decision following an executive session in his of

fice. The decision later was ratified by the council
in a public session.
Californians are happy
SAN FRANCISCO— Eighty-nine percent of
adults in California are either "very happy" or
"pretty happy," an increase of 12 percent in two
years, according to a new California poll.
The poll was conducted among 1,008 adults
between March 17 and March 26. The margin of
error was not immediately available.
In 1983, 25 percent said they were very happy,
52 percent said they were pretty happy and 22
percent said they were not too happy. In 1986,
however, 35 percent said they were very happy,
54 percent were pretty happy and only 11 per
cent were not too happy.
The poll found no significant differences in the
degree to which men and women described their
state of happiness. There were also no major dif
ferences among age groups as far as happiness
goes.
Not surprisingly, married people were des
cribed as significantly happier than those who
were divorced, widowed or separating. People
with low incomes are also less inclined to say that
they are happy compared to upper income re
spondents.
