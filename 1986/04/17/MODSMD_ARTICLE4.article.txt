# Judge rules out dismissing trial
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
A Palo Alto Municipal Court judge
yesterday denied a motion made
Tuesday by defense attorneys to dis
miss the trial of 23 Stanford anti
apartheid protesters.
Tuesday's pretrial court proceed
ings revealed a mistake by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Of
fice which defense attorneys believed
constituted grounds for dismissal of
the case, but Judge Franklin Elia
ruled against the dismissal yesterday
afternoon.
"In [Elia's] estimation, the prose
cutor's misconduct was not in bad
faith and was not intentional," said
defense attorney John Starbuck, add
ing, "We believe it was a misreading
of the law."
The defense's claim centered
around videotapes made of the anti
apartheid sit-ins at Old Union Oct.
11, 14 and 16. Edited and unedited
versions of the tapes existed, but
defense attorneys were only given the
edited version.
According to defense attorney
Tony Press, the prosecution must
provide all potentially relevant
evidence to the defense well in ad
vance of the trial. Defense attorneys
argued that not being provided with
the unedited tape amounted to
prosecutorial misconduct, and moved
to dismiss the trial.
According to Starbuck, Elia did
grant a continuance, which would
give the defense additional time to
prepare.
Deputy District Attorney Peter
Waite, who is prosecuting the case,

said the length of the continuance was
not specified. "The court has left it up
to [the defense] to determine how
long a continuance they might want."
Waite said of the videotape inci
dent: "It was a mistake, it's not what 1
intended." He added that he had no
objections to the continuance.
Elia also ruled yesterday against al
lowing defense attorneys to argue
freedom of speech as a defense. On
Tuesday, Elia left open the possibility
for this "First Amendment defense,"
by making only a tentative denial.
Yesterday he formally ruled against
it.
Senior Robby Perkins, one of the
23 protesters standing trial, said he
has been disappointed with the trial
proceedings. "Things haven't gone
well at all," Perkins said of Elia's
denials of the First Amendment
defense and trial dismissal.
"At this point I don't see a real
solid chance of successfully maintain
ing our innocence throughout the
trial," Perkins said.
Today's pretrial motions will con
tinue with the jury selection process
started Tuesday. Yesterday some po
tential jurors were excluded because
of ties to Stanford. According to
Waite, the final jury of 12 could be
selected by the end of the day.
The 23 protesters, who include Sta
tistics Prof. Charles Stein, face
charges of trespassing, unlawful as
sembly and refusal to disperse.
The Final 12 will be selected from
an original pool of 495. According to
County Public Defender Aram Jones,
defense attorneys are allowed to ask
potential jurors questions about di
vestment. Stanford and apartheid.
