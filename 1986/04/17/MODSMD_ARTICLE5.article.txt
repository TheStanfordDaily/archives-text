This is the first in a series of articles on stu
dent publications around campus.
"Hey guys, I've got a germ. How about a
takeoff on 'Leave it to Beaver' called
'Leave it to Gipper?' "
A group of about 30 people stared at the

unfortunate confessor of the unfortunate
idea. The silence said it all —forget it, bud.
This is how a typical staff meeting at the
Chaparral might go. The editor of the last
issue of the Chaparral, senior Ron Herbst,
explained how this college humor magazine
formulates its satires, cartoons and stories.
"Basically, it takes a long time to get
everyone settled down at the meetings.
Those who refuse to shut up are forced to
stand in the corner," he said. "Finally, we

start tossing ideas around — we call them
'germs.' Someone brings up a germ, then we
go through all possible permutations of it."
Herbst said that any interested person can
join at any time, but not without notice. "We
usually make new people tell a joke.
Sometimes they have to wear our pair of X
ray sunglasses while they're telling it,"he
said.
The weekly meetings are on Wednesday
evenings at 8. They usually last about an
hour. Herbst noted that "meetings are really
well populated, with about 30 present, but
only 15 people help out a lot."
The new editor, sophomore Josh
Weinstein, said that a lot of new people have
joined the "Chappie" staff, especially fresh
men. One predominant complaint, however,
is that there are not enough women.
The rising tide of newcomers seems to
coincide with the rising popularity of the

magazine. "The past few years have
been great for the Chaparral; it has
really become a sleek publication,"
Weinstein remarked.
Unfortunately, the past year or so
has also included some financial diffi
culties. Business Manager Jim Suhre
explained, "First, we lost the fee
assessment last spring. Then our
former business manager stopped out
unexpectedly, and the records were
lost in the process. When things fi
nally cleared out, we realized that we
owed a large debt to our printer."
Suhre, a sophomore, took over last
autumn. His main task was to elimi
nate that debt. He began running the
Chaparral like a business, finding
ways of cutting expenses here and
there. "We are seeking to eliminate
the debt sometime next year," he
said.
Funding for the Chaparral comes
from the Publications Board, from
advertising and from sales. "We
make our profits from sales," Suhre
explained. "We are making small
amounts of profits, somewhere in the
low hundreds of dollars. Usually our
profits stay in the account for future
issues, but now they are going straight
to the printer."

Suhre also noted that "in times of
trouble, the Hammer and Coffin So
ciety sometimes helps."
The exact affiliation of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society with the
Chaparral is uncertain: it is a Chappie
secret that has special overtones.
Suhre would only refer to the society
as "our publisher."
Herbst recounted part of the story
of the society's beginnings: "The H &
C Society was founded in 1906 by
members of the Chaparral — in a
pub. That was the night when the
great earthquake destroyed half the
campus. They saw it as sort of sign
from above. ..
In any case, the Hammer and Cof
fin Society helps the Chaparral with
its pranks, in addition to providing
support in times of need. "We're the
ones who put the Mickey Mouse face
on the Clock Tower the night before
its opening in the spring of 1983,"
Herbst said.
Herbst also told how, years ago,
students from the Chappie somehow
managed to change the headlines of
The Stanford Daily. The main story
was one big pun: "Tragedy Strikes
Bowling Team — Nobody Spared."
More recently, however, the Chapar
ral is famed for its floating "Lambo"
at last autumn's Big Game.

The next issue will be coming out
sometime in May. It is expected to
match, if not exceed, the sales of the
last Chaparral — over 1,700 copies.
Not since the 1960s has the magazine
been so popular.
Why the former decline in sales?
Herbst reasoned, "We are here to
perpetuate campus humor. Campus
humor is very special; it has more bite
— more than other humor, such as
television sit-coms. There are less
holds on it. We are getting cruder and
cruder all the time. We offend some
people. Some people won't read the
Chaparral because it is full of black
humor."
But the staff at the Chaparral is
working harder than ever to put out a
quality magazine, Herbst said. The
Chaparral is the second oldest humor
magazine in the nation (it was
founded in 1899), but Herbst said it is
by no means inferior to the oldest
magazine, thej Harvard Lampoon.
There is no real rivalry between the
two magazines, Weinstein said. He
even hopes that someday the two
magazines will do an issue together.
In the end, the rivalry is not impor
tant. Weinstein said, "It is important
to make others laugh and to have
fun."
