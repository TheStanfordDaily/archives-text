# Affirmative action
## In hiring and admissions, how does the University measure up? 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
In the first article of a three-part series, The Daily
examines the state of affirmative action at Stanford:
its successes, its failures and its prospects for the
future.
To many people, the phrase "affirmative action"'
conjures up images of quotas, federal bureaucracy
and allegations of "reverse discrimination."
Although this public perception and the current
attitudes of many federal officials to affirmative ac
tion indicate that approval of mandated policies
may be eroding, Stanford remains unwavering in its
support of affirmative action programs in both the
admission of students and the hiring of faculty and

staff, according to University administrators.
In a long-standing effort to promote educational
and institutional diversity, Stanford has opted to
follow hiring and admissions policies that attempt
to ensure that the University community in some
way reflects a broad spectrum of society, officials
say.
Administrators responsible for developing Stan
ford's affirmative action plan vigorously defend the
oft-maligned and misunderstood policy.
"Our educational purposes will be served best if
we reflect the full range and the full capacity of this
society," University President Donald Kennedy
said in a written statement reaffirming Stanford's
commitment to the principle of diversity through
affirmative action.

The Stanford plan represents a deep-rooted
commitment to the premise that "diversity is good
for the institution in itself," said Santiago
Rodriguez, University affirmative action officer.
An affirmative action program counters any det
rimental effects of a predominantly white
"majority culture," said Jim Bouquin, University
director of disabled student services.
A lack of diversity in an educational environ
ment "goes against the grain of any kind of
reasonable definition of education or learning,"
Bouquin said, noting a need to counteract the pos
sible Stanford stereotype of a "white, rich, straight
toothed jogger."
