# Affirmative action
## In hiring and admissions, how does the University measure up? 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
In the first article of a three-part series, The Daily
examines the state of affirmative action at Stanford:
its successes, its failures and its prospects for the
future.
To many people, the phrase "affirmative action"'
conjures up images of quotas, federal bureaucracy
and allegations of "reverse discrimination."
Although this public perception and the current
attitudes of many federal officials to affirmative ac
tion indicate that approval of mandated policies
may be eroding, Stanford remains unwavering in its
support of affirmative action programs in both the
admission of students and the hiring of faculty and

staff, according to University administrators.
In a long-standing effort to promote educational
and institutional diversity, Stanford has opted to
follow hiring and admissions policies that attempt
to ensure that the University community in some
way reflects a broad spectrum of society, officials
say.
Administrators responsible for developing Stan
ford's affirmative action plan vigorously defend the
oft-maligned and misunderstood policy.
"Our educational purposes will be served best if
we reflect the full range and the full capacity of this
society," University President Donald Kennedy
said in a written statement reaffirming Stanford's
commitment to the principle of diversity through
affirmative action.

The Stanford plan represents a deep-rooted
commitment to the premise that "diversity is good
for the institution in itself," said Santiago
Rodriguez, University affirmative action officer.
An affirmative action program counters any det
rimental effects of a predominantly white
"majority culture," said Jim Bouquin, University
director of disabled student services.
A lack of diversity in an educational environ
ment "goes against the grain of any kind of
reasonable definition of education or learning,"
Bouquin said, noting a need to counteract the pos
sible Stanford stereotype of a "white, rich, straight
toothed jogger."
Although Stanford makes an infor
mal effort to achieve an acceptable
gender and racial balance, it also ad
dresses this concern through an ex
haustive study of the demographics of
the entire University community.
Statistical analysis as well as personal
observation are combined into a sys
tematic affirmative action plan to
identify pioblems and to chart prog
ress toward specific goals.
University administrators cite con
fusion over subtle differences be
tween "equal opportunity" and
affirmative action in employment
as a possible source of much of the
public disillusionment with the policy.
A component of the Civil Rights
Act of 1 964 which prohibits any form
of discrimination, equal employment
opportunity (EEO) law guarantees
individual rights that are race- and
sex-neutral.
Affirmative action was originally
mandated in a Johnson Administra
tion executive order that directed all

federal contractors to establish pro
grams to promote the hiring of indi
viduals who traditionally had been
excluded or under-represented in the
workforce.
A product of the realization that
the EEO alone would not ensure in
tegration of the workforce, affirma
tive action, unlike EEO, is race- and
sex-conscious in attempting to rem
edy past systemic discrimination un
der the premise that "equal opportu
nity by itself does not change sys
tems," Rodriguez said.
Although race- and sex-conscious,
affirmative action is intended to
broaden applicant pools rather than
supplant merit considerations in
hiring practices or admissions stand
ards.
"The University must not sacrifice
job-related standards when it engages
in affirmative action," Kennedy said.
"The best qualified person. ~ must
always be hired — that is the essence
of equal opportunity. Affirmative ac
tion simply asks us to cast our net
more widely, to broaden the competi
tion and to develop innovative human
resource management strategies for
groups that have historically been

relegated to the periphery of sociey.
Under the federal requirement for
affirmative action goals and
timetables, women and specified ra
cial groups — blacks, Hispanics,
Asian-Americans and Native
Americans — are included in the
University plan.
The plan also includes certain
"protected classes" without the goal
and timetable requirement, but
guaranteeing equal employment op
portunities without regard to veteran
status, age, physical impairment or
sexual orientation.
The University attempts to balance
sex-conscious and sex-neutral
philosophies by using affirmative ac
tion programs to broaden applicant
pools, EEO principles to ensure fair
hiring practices and reviews of the re
sulting workforce and student popu
lation to judge the failure or success
of the plan.
Although Stanford is mandated to
have a plan because of its status as a
federal contractor, the University
would have the plan "whether the
government says so or not,"
Rodriguez said.

c »H e ral codes specify that the Uni
versity must submit periodic statisti
cal reports to indicate compliance
with federal guidelines. Ultimate re
sponsibility for the implementation of
any affirmative action program rests
with the University president, but
Kennedy has delegated responsibili
ties throughout the University admin
istration-
Responsibility for EEO compli
ance and affirmative action programs
throughout the University has been
delegated to Rodriguez. Faculty af
firmative action is the responsibility
of Provost James Rosse, and other
University vice presidents have been
appointed in their own departments.
The vice presidents have appointed
affirmative action coordinators to aid
in implementation of policy.
While the University has main
tained a formal plan since the mid
-19705, Stanford constantly upgrades
the policy. Despite some notable suc
cess in the integration of women into
the faculty, workforce and student
populations, administrators admit
that Stanford still has a long way to go
in achieving its self-imposed goals.
