# Former Jamaican leader speaks

"The Third World must begin marginal
delinkage form the North and build a foundation
for relative self-reliance" in order to overcome the
"primary obstacles to Third World development:
racism and debt," the former Prime Minister of
Jamaica said here last night.
Michael Manley, an outspoken critic of "modern
investment imperialism" and a leader in the call for
a reorganized international economy, enjoys a
broad international following, and despite a one
hour delay was welcomed with a standing ovation
by the capacity Kresge audience.
"When operating in a free-market, lesser
developed countries become more dependent,"
Manley said, pointing out that foreign investment
drains economic resources from periphery nations
and decreases their purchasing power by forcing in
creased debt.
Jamaica's debt stands at over one-and-a-half
times Jamaica's gross national product with 40 per
cent of its foreign exchange being used to cover in
terest costs, he said.
"The United States has not cooperated with any
proposais to change the international economic
system. The IMF (International Monetary Fund)
operates in a manner that is hostile to the Third
World, and multinational corporations are in
sensitive to our needs," he said.
Manley likened the IMF system to a series of
charades. "Mexico pretends it can pay its debt, the
U.S. pretends Mexico can find a way, and the bank
ers pretend their money is safe." He asserted that
this creates an unstable world environment.

The Socialist International's Economic Commit
tee, which Manley chairs, has recently developed a
proposal to help manage the Third World debt, he
said. The report calls for repayment to be limited to
no more than 20 percent of the value of a debtor
nation's exports, the elimination of all sub-Saharan
African debt and the establishment of a special in
ternational bond to satisfy creditors by substituting
for repayment.

Manley said he does not call for a severence of
economic ties between the developed and Third
worlds because he realizes that small nations re
quire foreign investment. He said, however, the
Third World can avoid exploitation through
regional economic planning among lesser
developed nations.
Problems with racism also plague the Third
World, Manley said, calling the fight against apart
heid "the sacred struggle of our time" and urging
divestment of South Africa-related stock.
"The Nicaraguan government is a
democratically elected regime, but the United
States has no difficulty imposing embargoes against
it. But South Africa remains the most immoral
regime worldwide, and yet there is no embargo
against it," Manley said.
Manley was the recipient of a special United Na
tions medal in 1978 for his work to counter apart
heid.
Manley heads the socialist opposition People's
National Party (PNP) in Jamaica and leads Prime
Minister Seaga in all recent polls, with 61 percent
support. He has called for elections since January
1985, but Seaga said he will wait until 1988 to call
elections when he is constitutionally required to do
so.
Manley was overwhelmingly defeated by Seaga
in 1980 after eight years as Prime Minister. He
accused the United States of sabotaging the
Jamaican economy in order to assure his defeat,
saying "there is no doubt that manipulation played
a role." At the time, former U.N. Ambassador
Andrew Young accused the National Security
Council of targeting Manley's defeat.
