### SUSAN GREIM 
Five Stanford faculty members
and one staff member have been
selected as recipients of the 62nd
annual John Simon Guggenheim
Memorial Fellowships for 1986.
The awardees include Judith
Brown, associate professor of his
tory; Solomon Feferman, profes
sor of mathematics and
philosophy; Peter Hammond, pro
fessor of economics; Leonard
Herzenberg, professor of genetics;
Vikram Seth, writer and senior
editor for the Stanford Press; and
Virginia Walbot, associate profes
sor of biological sciences.
Recipients were selected on the
basis of unusually distinguished
achievement in the past, and ex
ceptional promise for future ac
complishment in the arts, scholar
ship and sciences. Along with the
honor of being selected for a Gug
genheim Fellowship, comes one
year of paid leave that enables the

fellow to do intense research.
Feferman, who since 1982 has
been assembling volumes of Kurt
Godel's published and un
published works, plans to spend
part of his year in Switzerland
doing theoretical work in logic.
Hammond, director of eco
nomic studies at Stanford, plans to
have a "fruitful year" at the Cen
ter of Operations Research in Bel
gium. His research, which he has
been working on for the last 10
years, concerned limited informa
tion and economic policy.
Other Stanford faculty involved
with the Guggenheim Foundation
were Nobel laureate Kenneth Ar
row, professor of economics, and
Joan Kenney, professor of opera
tions research at Stanford, who
served on this year's committee of
selection for the awards.
The Stanford recipients were
among 272 winners chosen from
3,717 applications for awards,
totaling $5,899,000.
