# Union protests layoffs
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN 
Twenty members of United Stan
ford Workers (USW) picketed
outside the office of Information
Technology Services (ITS) Director
Ed Shaw yesterday to protest the
layoff of 10 ITS employees last
month.
The union, which represents 1,300
University technical, maintenance
and service workers, charged that the
layoffs were part of a long-term effort
by Stanford to weaken the union
"little by little," acting USW Presi
dent Dennis Blake said.
The layoffs "were directed towards
people who were very active in the
union," said Aloha Keylor, USW vice
president and one of those laid off.
"There was no consistent criteria
such as seniority used to determine
who would be laid off."
Shaw denied the charge, saying the
layoffs were the result of economic
realities. "It is absolutely false that
ITS did anything with reference to
the union," he said. Changing tech
nologies in data entry and printing
made the layoffs necessary, he said.
The incidents protested were two
separate actions, according to Shaw.
Four employees of the Graphic and
Printing Services (GAPS) arm of ITS
were laid off effective March 10 be
cause "there were more people than
necessary in the backshop and in cus
tomer service. New technologies,
such as the Macintosh personal com
puter, have made graphics printing
very inexpensive and decreased
demand for our services," he said.
The other six employees were laid
off April 4 from the data entry
branch of ITS because remote termi
nals are replacing centralized data
entry, he said.
Blake charged Shaw with
"mismanagment of GAPS as a set
up: you can turn around and blame
the workers because you're not
making enough. Then you pick and
choose who you want to get rid of."
In addition to Keylor, two others
were USW leaders: Don Fernandez,
a member of the union's Affirmative
Action Committee, and Ramiro
Quirez, a supporter of USWs Strike
Preparation Committee.
In regard to the GAPS action, "an
investigation we began at the time has
concluded that the layoffs were in
violation of contract, without regard
for seniority and for discriminatory
reasons," said Mary Ann Tenuto,
USW associate staff counsel.
Concerning the data entry layoffs,
Blake argued that ITS should have
retrained those employees "to use the
remote terminals, rather than putting
them out on the street."
But Shaw said, "Remote terminals
are being used to enter data over
which ITS has no control. They are
being used by people who used to
need secretaries to input data, but are
now doing it themselves."
Senior Steven Phillips, chairman of
the Black Student Union and a par
ticipant in the protest, said he was
"deeply distressed by the University's
actions towards minorities in the
USW."
Of the 10 j, laid off, four were
Asian, three Hispanic and two black,
said Tenuto.
Shaw denied all charges of racism.
The USW holds Shaw responsible
for the layoffs, according to a flier
distributed by union members.
Placards were piled outside his office
at the conclusion of the hour-long
demonstration. On April 6 USW
members picketed his Stanford
residence in a demonstration Shaw
called "inappropriate but within their
rights."
