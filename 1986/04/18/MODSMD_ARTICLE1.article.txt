Twenty members of United Stan
ford Workers (USW) picketed
outside the office of Information
Technology Services (ITS) Director
Ed Shaw yesterday to protest the
layoff of 10 ITS employees last
month.
The union, which represents 1,300
University technical, maintenance
and service workers, charged that the
layoffs were part of a long-term effort
by Stanford to weaken the union
"little by little," acting USW Presi

people who were very active in the
union," said Aloha Keylor, USW vice
president and one of those laid off.
"There was no consistent criteria
such as seniority used to determine
who would be laid off."
Shaw denied the charge, saying the
layoffs were the result of economic

ITS did anything with reference to

made the layoffs necessary, he said.
The incidents protested were two
separate actions, according to Shaw.
Four employees of the Graphic and
Printing Services (GAPS) arm of ITS
were laid off effective March 10 be

necessary in the backshop and in cus

such as the Macintosh personal com
puter, have made graphics printing
very inexpensive and decreased
demand for our services," he said.
The other six employees were laid
off April 4 from the data entry
branch of ITS because remote termi
nals are replacing centralized data
entry, he said.
Blake charged Shaw with
"mismanagment of GAPS as a set
up: you can turn around and blame
the workers because you're not
making enough. Then you pick and
