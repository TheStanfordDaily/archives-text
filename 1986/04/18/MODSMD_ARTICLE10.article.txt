"What is important in the world is
how free individuals are ... so long as
they don't interfere with the freedom
of others," said Nobel Prize-winning
economist Milton Friedman in a
speech last night sponsored by Stan
ford Libertarians and Stanford Col
lege Republicans.
Friedman, a member of President
Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory
Board and a senior research fellow at
the Hoover Institution, explained
that the basis for the importance he
attaches to freedom is "humility."
Because nobody can know what is
morally wrong, Friedman said, the
"only appropriate response is discus
sion, persuasion, never coercion."
Friedman continued by defining
freedom as "the absence of coercion
to the fullest possible extent," ex
plaining that only the threat of physi

cal violence constitutes coercion.
Because laws carry the threat of
physical harm, Friedman said he
believes in limited government.
Friedman, who defined himself as
"a libertarian, with a small T " and
"a Republican with a large' R,' " con
tinued to develop the theme of his
desire for freedom as he spoke on the
subjects of libertarianism, the Liber
tarian Party and the Republican
Party.
Friedman explained that he is a
Republican instead of a Libertarian,
although he espouses many liber
tarian ideals, because he can ac
complish more of his goals as a Re
publican than as a Libertarian.
The value of the Libertarian Party,
Friedman said, is that as a "party of
principles" it can persuade members
of the two major parties to adopt
some of these principles.
But the Libertarian Party will cease
to be a party of principles as soon as it

starts electing candidates to office, he
said. If this happens, many more
diverse people will be attracted to the
party and it will lose its focus on
liberty.
According to Friedman, this has
happened to the Republican and
Democratic parties. Because these
parties are now "coalitions of
minorities," they must be
"expediency parties," concentrating
on pleasing the most people instead
of concentrating on what is right.
For a similar reason, these two par
ties are never substantially different,
Friedman said, explaining that they
must remain similar because they are
both competing for the support of a
large and diverse portion of the popu
lation.
The fact that two parties exist is
still significant, Friedman continued,
because the slight differences be
tween the two pull them both back
and forth between different positions,
allowing change to occur.
