## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Results Irom this week's ASSU spring elections will not
be available until tomorrow at 4 p.m., due to what Elec
tions Commissioner Robin Miller has described as
"operational difficulties."
Although Miller would not clarify the exact problems
causing the delay. Assoc. Elections Commissioner Maria
Huntalas explained in general terras a mix-up involving
the computer program that runs with the Scantron ma
chine."
According to Huntalas, "you have to know where the
program is on the tape" that runs the Scantron machine.
Since "there is no catalog" of programs for that tape,
members of this elections commission have been attempt
ing to contact a member of last year's commission to find
out where the program is located on the tape.
l he person the election officials have attempted to
contact had not returned their calls as of 8 p.m. yesterday,

Huntalas said. However, she said last night that the com
mission "should get preliminary results tomorrow after
noon," with "more accurate" results posted Monday.
Miller, however, said the results will not be available
until Saturday at 4 p.m. He called the computer a "minor
component" in the entire problem. The commissioners
still have to separate the ballots, he said.
"Our first guess" as to when results would be available
"was way too optimistic," Miller said.
While the commissioners have been able to start "hand
counting" the write-in ballots, which include ballots for
senior class president, the advisory measures and the
graduate ballot revisions, Huntalas said they "don't want
to announce results until we can do everything." She
added that "we still haven't gotten the absentee and over
seas ballots," which could influence the results.
Miller agreed that there is no possibility that results
from the write-in ballots can be reported before all other
ballots have been tallied.
