# Rinc-a-delt party to be held in Frostâ€”without alcohol
## 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Because of a University decision
that alcohol cannot be served in
Frost Amphitheatre, next month's
annual Rinc-a-delt party will be
alcohol-free.
The benefits of holding the May
3 event in Frost, where the Univer
sity prohibits liquor for safety
reasons, outweighed the costs of
not serving alcohol, according to
Rinconada house officers.
"Looking at the security and
noise problems (associated with
holding the party on Wilbur Field
or another area near the dorm), we
decided it was worth not having al
cohol if we could have the party in
Frost," RA Rick Holtzapple said.
"It's not really a decision against
alcohol. It's a decision to go with
Frost," Holtzapple said, noting that
the dry event is not meant as part of
a recent trend toward alcohol-free
campus parties or in response to

recent alcohol-related incidents at
fraternities.
Last year's Rinc-a-delt was cut
short when police closed down the
party because of neighborhood
complaints about noise. Holtzapple
said holding the party in Frost will
avoid noise disruptions and party
crashing by non-Stanford students.
The decision to have the party in
Frost despite the University ban on
alcohol "is part of a trend to keep
Stanford parties for Stanford stu
dents," Holtzapple added. House
residents plan either to check for
Stanford identification at the en
trance to Frost or hire security
guards, he said.
Ellie Oppenheim, associate dean
of Student Affairs and director of
Tresidder Union, said her office,
which is responsible for supervising
such use of University land, "views
each situation individually" but
decided that alcohol in Frost could
create safety problems.
Oppenheim said Frost is a diffi

cult place to manage because of the
terraced floor and trees that sur
round the amphitheater.
Oppenheim characterized the
Rinc-a-delt as "a major public
event"and said that smaller
residence parties, where alcohol is
often served regardless of age,
present "somewhat different con
cerns."
Rinconada House President Phil
Klein said the house residents'
response to the University's deci
sion was "mixed."
"People's first reaction was: 'My
God, how can we have a party with
out beer? It'll just be a concert," "
Klein said, noting that he expects a
smaller crowd than if there were al
cohol. "We've got to make it a
party without [alcohol]."
Rinc-a-delt organizers had
originally hoped to hold the party
in Frost and serve alcohol, but Op
penheim and Tresidder Asst.
Director Nancy Howe ruled out al
cohol Monday.
