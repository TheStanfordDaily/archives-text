## An Independent Newspaper Test ban rejection right 
### 
Last Thursday, the United States exploded a small
nuclear device under the deserts of Nevada. The next
day, the Soviet Union attacked the U.S. test as
"dangerous" and "destabilizing," and declared that its
self-imposed eight-month moritorium on nuclear
weapons testing had come to an end. Another golden
opportunity for arms negotiation seemed lost — this
time by President Reagan's stubborn insistence to keep
on testing.
But was the Reagan Administration in the wrong
this time? First of all, the timing of the Soviet offer was
obviously in their favor. After completing an extensive
program of testing, Gorbachev chose Aug. 6 — the
anniversary of the Hiroshima holocaust— to announce
his ban and to challenge the United States to do the
same. Acceptance would have forced the United States
to forego a series of previously planned tests. The
United States declined and the Soviets — even as they

made impassioned pleas for U.S. testing to stop — con
tinued with preparations for resuming their own tests.
More important than the back-and-forth
propaganda war, however, is that as a starting point for
arms control, a test ban just doesn't make sense. While
we may agree that arms control is vital and long
overdue, a comprehensive agreement must include all
facets of the issue — development, testing and deploy
ment of weapons. Limiting one without the other two
is useless if not counterproductive. A moritorium on
testing alone will simply result in a world in which we
have more and larger weapons which we are less sure
will actually work. This will not benefit anyone; in this
area, there is no room for doubt.
Now is the time to move ahead with an across-the
board arms control agreement. But the Reagan Ad
ministration, in rejecting a cosmetic test ban treaty,
made the correct decision.
