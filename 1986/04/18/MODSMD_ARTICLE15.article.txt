## Viewpoint Bombing a terrorist act? 
### 
It has been fascinating since the Monday bombings of
Libya to see how that act has been justified by the United
States.
The justification for the U.S. bombing of Libya has
been premised on a distinction between terrorism and
self-defense, between Libyan actions (bombing a West
Berlin discotheque) and U.S. actions (bombing Tripoli
and Benghazi). The wartime impulse to polarize enemy
from ally certainly contributes to a sharpening of the dis
tinction, but on what grounds does the distiction stand?
What keeps President Reagan excluded from the com
pany of terrorists? The animating principle of the distinc
tion between terrorist and self-defender, between "them"
and "us" surfaced when a reporter asked Defense Secre
tary Casper Weinberger about Libyan casualties caused
by the bombing. He said something like, "We don't even
know yet that we've killed anybody." His answer gave
away the whole secret.

JOHN D. PETERS

A terrorist is brutal, barbarous and inhuman because he
is immediately aware of the consequences of his actions.
There is not remoteness or alienation in terrorist action:
he is directly implicated in the destruction of flesh and
blood, often to the point of including his own (as in suicide
bombings). Terrorism is morally outrageous because it
destroys specific human beings in living color without bat
ting an eye. It admits to harboring violent and vicious
motives.
Consider, in contrast, Weinberger's Olympian abstrac
tion. He was free to hold forth about "elements"
(bombers) and "targets" (people) as he pointed to the
map of Europe and northern Africa. Secretary of State
George Shultz, like the good business school professor
that he is, spoke of the bombing as "raising the cost" of
Libyan terrorism — as if he was talking about supply and
demand curves, as if Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy could be expected to behave like a
"rational"/io/no economicus calculating costs and
benefits. Anybody could see that Weinberger and Shultz
were anything but bloodthirsty, crazed, death-drunk
fanatics. They appeared as competent bureaucrats. Their
"humanity" was in no way tarnished by barbarous emo
tions or impulses.
Joseph Stalin summed up these matters best with a hor
rifyingly matter-of-fact comment: "One death is a
tragedy; a million deaths a statistic." Brutality prevails at
the local level while massive destruction is unthinkable or
even banal. The human race has not yet developed the
moral discourse for comprehending the terror of abstract
destruction. It is striking that terrorism, which deals in vi

olent and vivid death for a few, seems more outrageous
than the constant, silent violence of famine, oppression or
even genocide. Our moral sensibilites remain outraged at
willful murder, yet fail to be aroused by massive destruc
tion without a defined agent. One of the great historical
anomalies of the 20th century is the capacity of civilized
individuals to kill others on a massive scale (the problem,
one might say, of how the culture that produced Beetho
ven and Goethe also produced Hitler and Eichmann).
Consider a thought experiment. Let us suppose that
Reagan, instead of using airplanes from Britain, had
somehow gotten somebody in Libya (undercover agents,
say) to plant the bombs. For the sake of argument, let us
say that the bombs thus planted caused identical destruc
tion to those dropped from the planes (including killing
the 15-month-old adopted daughter of a head of state).
What would then exclude Reagan et al. from the com
pany of terrorists? Why is it that bombs from airplanes are
civilized and planted bombs are barbarous?
Reagan's claims of civilization for himself and barba
rism for Khadafy turn on the question of methodology
alone. Concrete destruction is barbarous, abstract
destruction is civilized. The key issue is the intent and
technique of the agent. Reagan seems to be able to claim a
spiritual superiority because of rational calculation of self
defense and bomb tonnage rather than any concrete en
gagement in the destruction (which would make him a ter
rorist). As Aldous Huxley noted, modern warfare tends to
become a matter of geometry. Talking about lines of
force, points of conflict and units obscures the incon
venient fact that individuals are killed. Reagan's methods
(which stem from the structure of the modern state) have
the remarkable property of being able to diffuse responsi
bility for death and destruction almost infinitely. One can
point to the author of a terrorist act; but who bombed
Libya? The pilots? The designers of the planes? The Pent
agon? Weinberger, Shultz or Reagan? "Civilized men"
have an advantage, it seems, over barbarians: the deaths
they cause are authorless.
The question of the purity of method seems downright
narcissistic when one thinks of innocent deaths, on either
side of the we/they divide. The things that distinguish t le
bombing of Libya from "terrorism" disappear when one
shifts from agents to victims. For how can one kill in order
to preserve life?
Even if the bombing does prove to put a temporary halt
to terrorism (which nobody seems to believe), the ways it
has been justified only serve to continue a far more in
sidious reign of terror: the idea that killing people is okay
when it is done by the proper methods, with the right state
of mind and without any concrete engagement. The ap
parent justification is ultimately a condemnation.

destroys specific human beings in living color without bat
ting an eye. It admits to harboring violent and vicious
motives.
Consider, in contrast, Weinberger's Olympian abstrac
tion. He was free to hold forth about "elements"
(bombers) and "targets" (people) as he pointed to the
map of Europe and northern Africa. Secretary of State
George Shultz, like the good business school professor
that he is, spoke of the bombing as "raising the cost" of
Libyan terrorism — as if he was talking about supply and
demand curves, as if Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy could be expected to behave like a
"rational"/io/no economicus calculating costs and
benefits. Anybody could see that Weinberger and Shultz
were anything but bloodthirsty, crazed, death-drunk
fanatics. They appeared as competent bureaucrats. Their
"humanity" was in no way tarnished by barbarous emo
tions or impulses.
Joseph Stalin summed up these matters best with a hor
rifyingly matter-of-fact comment: "One death is a
tragedy; a million deaths a statistic." Brutality prevails at
the local level while massive destruction is unthinkable or
even banal. The human race has not yet developed the
moral discourse for comprehending the terror of abstract
destruction. It is striking that terrorism, which deals in vi

olent and vivid death for a few, seems more outrageous
than the constant, silent violence of famine, oppression or
even genocide. Our moral sensibilites remain outraged at
willful murder, yet fail to be aroused by massive destruc
tion without a defined agent. One of the great historical
anomalies of the 20th century is the capacity of civilized
individuals to kill others on a massive scale (the problem,
one might say, of how the culture that produced Beetho
ven and Goethe also produced Hitler and Eichmann).
Consider a thought experiment. Let us suppose that
Reagan, instead of using airplanes from Britain, had
somehow gotten somebody in Libya (undercover agents,
say) to plant the bombs. For the sake of argument, let us
say that the bombs thus planted caused identical destruc
tion to those dropped from the planes (including killing
the 15-month-old adopted daughter of a head of state).
What would then exclude Reagan et al. from the com
pany of terrorists? Why is it that bombs from airplanes are
civilized and planted bombs are barbarous?
Reagan's claims of civilization for himself and barba
rism for Khadafy turn on the question of methodology
alone. Concrete destruction is barbarous, abstract
destruction is civilized. The key issue is the intent and
technique of the agent. Reagan seems to be able to claim a
spiritual superiority because of rational calculation of self
defense and bomb tonnage rather than any concrete en
gagement in the destruction (which would make him a ter
rorist). As Aldous Huxley noted, modern warfare tends to
become a matter of geometry. Talking about lines of
force, points of conflict and units obscures the incon
venient fact that individuals are killed. Reagan's methods
(which stem from the structure of the modern state) have
the remarkable property of being able to diffuse responsi
bility for death and destruction almost infinitely. One can
point to the author of a terrorist act; but who bombed
Libya? The pilots? The designers of the planes? The Pent
agon? Weinberger, Shultz or Reagan? "Civilized men"
have an advantage, it seems, over barbarians: the deaths
they cause are authorless.
The question of the purity of method seems downright
narcissistic when one thinks of innocent deaths, on either
side of the we/they divide. The things that distinguish t le
bombing of Libya from "terrorism" disappear when one
shifts from agents to victims. For how can one kill in order
to preserve life?
Even if the bombing does prove to put a temporary halt
to terrorism (which nobody seems to believe), the ways it
has been justified only serve to continue a far more in
sidious reign of terror: the idea that killing people is okay
when it is done by the proper methods, with the right state
of mind and without any concrete engagement. The ap
parent justification is ultimately a condemnation.

It has been fascinating since the Monday bombings of
Libya to see how that act has been justified by the United
States.
The justification for the U.S. bombing of Libya has
been premised on a distinction between terrorism and
self-defense, between Libyan actions (bombing a West
Berlin discotheque) and U.S. actions (bombing Tripoli
and Benghazi). The wartime impulse to polarize enemy
from ally certainly contributes to a sharpening of the dis
tinction, but on what grounds does the distiction stand?
What keeps President Reagan excluded from the com
pany of terrorists? The animating principle of the distinc
tion between terrorist and self-defender, between "them"
and "us" surfaced when a reporter asked Defense Secre
tary Casper Weinberger about Libyan casualties caused
by the bombing. He said something like, "We don't even
know yet that we've killed anybody." His answer gave
away the whole secret.

JOHN D. PETERS

A terrorist is brutal, barbarous and inhuman because he
is immediately aware of the consequences of his actions.
There is not remoteness or alienation in terrorist action:
he is directly implicated in the destruction of flesh and
blood, often to the point of including his own (as in suicide
bombings). Terrorism is morally outrageous because it
destroys specific human beings in living color without bat
ting an eye. It admits to harboring violent and vicious
motives.
