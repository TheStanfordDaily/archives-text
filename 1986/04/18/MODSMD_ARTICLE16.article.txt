# Attack won't deter terrorism
## 
### 
Three days ago, the president showed the world that
he's mad as hell and isn't going to take it anymore.
Americans, on the whole, are pretty pleased with their
"fearless leader." And yet the attack on Libya has dan
gerously escalated the conflict, and will probably increase
terrorist activity rather than reduce it.
We're pleased anyway. For years the United States has
felt like a victimized, helpless giant in the face of ter
rorism. And now finally, finally, the most evil terrorist of
all — Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy — has got
ten his just deserts.
But before we get too smug, we should consider some
issues. What was the purpose of the attack? To weaken
terrorist organizations? To deter future terrorist attacks?
Or to punish the perpetrators of terrorism? Did the attack
accomplish any of these goals? And did the United States
have any other option short of using military force?

The Reagan Admistration claimed to have alt three
goals in mind, and yet it seems almost certain that the first
two — weakening or deterring terrorism — were not ac
complished. Because of the very nature of terrorism
(independent cells acting semi-autonomously with spon
sorship from more than one state and organization),
knocking out a few training camps just won't do the job.
It is also very difficult to deter terrorism. For deterrence
to work, terrorists must believe that if they perpetrate ter
rorism, they will be worse off than they would be if they
didn't perpetrate terrorism. And yet since terrorists are
willing to die for their cause anyway, or feel they have
nothing to lose, the threat of death probably has little ef
fect. I doubt that any terrorist sat up in bed the morning
after the bombing and said, "Well hey, I suppose I'd bet
ter stop killing civilians, or else the United States may
bomb another Libyan target." More likely, the bombing
of Libya has made terrorism seem even more honorable
and more necessary as the only way of fighting back
against a power that is far superior militarily.
It seems most probable that the United States bombed
Libya in an effort to punish Khadafy, who the Adminis
tration sees as responsible for most of the world's ter
rorism. The Administration saw the need to punish
Khadafy because it didn't see another alternative, except
to continue to stand by and take it. Punishing Khadafy is
good for the U.S. morale, but that's about as far as it goes.
U.S. military action was largely an expression of the
frustration felt by a supeipower that was being kicked
around by whippersnappers. Terrorists have been killing
innocent civilians, and Reagan felt he could no longer
stand aside with a small stick, even if he was speaking
loudly. But a reasonable question to ask is: why did the
United States choose Libya? After all, it is well known
that Syria and Iran back terrorism also. But Syria is more

closely allied with the Soviet Union than is Libya, so a
strike there carries the danger of superpower confronta
tion. And a strike in Iran could lead to some messy tan
gling with the Persian Gulf war. Khadafy audaciously ex
presses his support for terrorism, he is not closely allied
with the Soviet Union and his military is nothing
compared with that of the United States. Libya, consider
ing all this, was the logical choice. The United States had
to do something, so it used Libya as an example to terror
ists everywhere.
Did the United States have another option aside from
military action? In one very real sense, no they didn't.
Given the Administration's overall Middle East policy,
the strong rhetorical stance President Reagan and his ad
visers have always taken against terrorism, Reagan's
desire to show that we are no longer victims of the
"Vietnam syndrome" and are willing to back up political
resolve with military might, the recent escalation in ter
rorism, and the fact that the United States has not been
able to convince its Western European allies to join it in
economic sanction against Libya, it is very understandable
that the Administration saw no other way out. Especially
after the incident in the Gulf of Sidra, a clash between the
United States and Libya seemed practically inevitable.
However, this does not mean that the United States was
inevitably fated to attack Libya. The events that led to the
U.S. attack must be seen as arising from Reagan's overall
Middle East policy. This policy is one seen by much of the
Arab population as exploitative — and to a large extent
they are right. The United States Ls not seen this way in
every Arab country, and probably not by most leaders of
the Arab world. And yet Khadafy, though his methods
may be odd at times, expresses sentiments popular among
many Arab people, especially among the Palestinians.
Khadafy has been able to exploit the Palestinian hatred
toward the United States in a way he probably would not
have been able to do if the Palestinian problem had been
addressed equitably.
The Palestmian-Isreali conflict is not the only conflict in
the Middle East, but it is the one that has produced the
most violence and bitterness toward the United States. All
along, the Administration should have been paying more
attention to solving that problem — cutting off terrorism
at the source instead of tackling the almost impossible
task of dealing with it after the fact.
Okay, so maybe the current situations could have been
headed off five years ago, but what is the United States
supposed to do now? I only hope that if Khadafy lives, he
won't be seen by the Arabs as a superhero for standing up
to the United States, and generate a newly enthusiastic
following determined to get back at the United States. Or
if he dies, I hope he won't be seen a martyr to be em
ulated. Perhaps the bombing of Libya will bring about
some positive results. Ironically enough, positive results
are more likely to be seen in Western Europe than the
Middle East. Perhaps this show of force will convince our
allies to join us in economic sanctions. Sanctions will
probably, in the long run, allow the United States to have
more influence over Libya than will periodic military ac
tion.
