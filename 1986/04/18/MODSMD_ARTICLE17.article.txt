Contra aid likely
to escalate conflict
In March, 1 sent a letter to my (or
more appropriately our) congress
man, Rep. Ed Zschau, urging him to
vote against the $100 million in mili
tary aid for the contras (the
Nicaraguan rebels) who have been
sporadically battling the Sandinista
regime for the past five years. Last
week. I received a letter from Zschau.
informing me that he supports contra
aid because it will "create incentives
for the Sandinistas to negotiate
seriously." The inherent flaw in his
carrot-and-stick approach is readily
apparent: as long as the contras con
tinue to pose a military threat to the
regime, the Sandinistas will not en
dorse the Contadora peace plan
which (among other things) calls for
Sandinista disarmament. For this rea
son, our congressman's scheme
translates only into a perpetuation of
the present conflict.
The controversial aid bill, which
goes before the House for a final vote
next week, calls for immediate trans
fer of 525 million in military aid to
the contras with the remaining $75
million to be put on hold for 90 days
while the Contadora group attempts
to reach a diplomatic settlement.
Unfortunately, the futility of
diplomatic efforts in the present at
mosphere was revealed last week
when the Contadora talks broke
down because the Sandinistas refused

to sign the draft proposal as long as
the United States continued to sup
port the contras. Although the Sandi
nistas" popularly perceived recal
citrance has played into the Reagan
Administration's hands, their behav
ior remains justified. Why should the
Sandinistas agree to disarmament
while the United States resuscitates
the battle-weary rebels? Conse
quently, Sandinista President Daniel
Ortega has recently proposed a con
tingency plan: the Sandinistas will
sign the latest Contadora draft pro
posal if the U.S. Congress rejects aid
to the contras.
Zschau's rationale for supporting
the contras can stem from two
sources. Either he is unaware of the
fundamental contradiction in his ar
gument. or like the Reagan Adminis
tration, he does not desire a
diplomatic solution to the
"Nicaraguan problem," and is only
finding a way to project the blame
onto the Sandinista government. The
latter proposition seems more
plausible since the Administration
has made it clear that the contras' ul
timate mission is to overthrow the
Sandinista regime. For this reason, I
perceive Zschau's attempt to tie con
tra aid to diplomacy as merely an un
persuasive ploy to gain popular sup
port for a dubious policy towards
Nicaragua.
Consequently, I will not be
surprised when the House grants
Reagan his contra aid next week.
Moreover, I will understand why the
Sandinista regime will refuse to

endorse a Contadora-type plan in the
next 90 days. Finally, I foresee an es
calation of the guerrilla war resulting
from the contra's enhanced war
fighting capabilities, which could
quite possibly draw in some of our
forces stationed in neighboring Hon
duras.

'Tombstones' are
symbols of victims
As a member of Sanctuary at Stan
ford, I am writing to explain the sym
bolism of the "tombstones" erected
in front of the Stanford Bookstore
last week.
Since 1979, over 80.000 Sal
vadorans and Guatemalans have
been killed by the violence in their
own countries. These crosses are a
memorial to the victims of this vio
lence. and a plea to Stanford and the
United States to grant those fleeing
that violence-safe asylum in our
country.
The 1980 Refugee Act states that
anyone who faces the risk of persecu
tion in his or her homeland has a right
to political asylum in this county. I
ask Stanford students to consider one
thing: It is reported that at least one
third of the over 1.000 Salvadorans
and Guatemalans deported each
month are tortured, kidnapped or
murdered when they return. Is the

United States really upholding its
own law in these cases? If not, isn't it
up to us as citizens to do so?

Death and gore;
reason for glee?
Yee-haw! Bomb the suckers!!!
Right on. I haven't come like this
since Grenada. Man, oh man, did we
kick ass. We killed people. Well, we
killed Libyans, and that's almost as
good. I wonder how many we got. A
couple hundred, at least. Think of
that! Shrapnel flying into their little
terrorist bodies, the skin melting off
their faces, loose limbs sticking up out
of rubble everywhere you look.
That'll teach em to respect the
sanctity of human life.
I can't tell you how proud I am to
be an American, how glad I am that I
already paid my taxes, so luckily some
of my money paid to kill one or two
of those little maggots. Wheeeew!
I've been wanting to do something
like this for a long time. We sure have
some country.
Oh, sorry, I gotta go. "The 700
Club"' is on. But I just wanted to offer
Master Reagan my sincerest con
gratulations for showing the world
just what sort of a country this is,
anyway. God bless.
