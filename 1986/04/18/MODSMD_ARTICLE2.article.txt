# Salvadoran to seek refuge in fraternity
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
Herman has been offered a new home.
In support of a growing sanctuary movement
here, the members of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity have volunteered their house as the
Salvadoran refugee's next place of residence.
Herman will live with the Dekes beginning Sun
day for up to three days, according to senior
Matt Bryza, a house resident.
The action will enable Herman, who is known
only by his first name, to continue living at Stan
ford while allowing students who house him to
comply with a residential policy limiting the
length a guest may stay in a University
residence to three days.
Yet the major benefit of Herman's nomadic
existence will be its effect of allowing him to
touch more people, said Bryza, the originator of
the Dekes' decision to house Herman.

"The whole point of this is to get the word out
to as many people as possible," he said.
Herman's continuous movement will also al
low him to elude potential pursuers from either
the Immigration and Naturalization Service or
the government of El Salvador, Bryza said, add
ing that the latter is of particular concern to
Herman. In addition, Herman reportedly
prefers to move around because it allows him to
tell more people about conditions in his
homeland and the plight of Central American
refugees.
Bryza said his decision to try to convince his
housemates to let Herman stay stemmed from
hearing Herman speak at a mass Sunday at
Memorial Church. He said he left the church
stunned at his ignorance about the situation of
Central American refugees, and he wished to do
something to help them and at the same time
inform people about what he termed the in-

policy.
When he heard Herman was being
housed at Casa Zapata, where he
stayed Wednesday and yesterday
after a three-day stint in Columbae
House, Bryza said he proposed to

other DKE house residents that his
house be next. The Dekes' reception
of the idea was almost unanimously
positive. "Everyone's pretty happy
about it,"he said.
Bryza said he hoped the action
would both increase attention to the
sanctuary issue and decrease bad
feelings about fraternities on campus.
"We think it's really necessary to

raise the consciousness of the frater
nity system in general and of my
house in particular," he said. "And
hopefully this will also improve the
image of fraternities at Stanford."
After sleeping at Casa Zapata
again tonight, Herman will visit Sal
vadoran friends in San Francisco to
morrow and make the move to the
DKE house Sunday.
