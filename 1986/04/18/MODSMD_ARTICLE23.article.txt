## Be a clown, be a bozo

"Howdy, boys and kiris, I'm Bozo the Clown!"
— Bozo the Clown
My Dad has this theory that I'll call the Bozo
Constant. It goes like this: "Any organization
you're ever involved in is going to have its share of
bozos."
I doubt that in my Dad's organizational
framework of the world he actually envisions guys
in baggy polka dots and cotton candy hair poking
their red licorice noses into corporate board rooms,
doodling in the margins of annual reports or making
pork bellies of themselves

on the commodities mar
ket, but I thought it was a
real honking noisemaker
of an image, so here it is.
What the Bozo Con
stant means is that wher
ever you are — Hewlett
Packard, Elks Lodge
3192, Stanford Univer
sity, Libya, wherever —
there's a certain
percentage of space set
aside for bozos. Depend-

ing on how pessimistic you are, that bozo rate can
range from a tenth to a quarter to 99 percent of the
population of whatever subgroup you're stuck in.
I'm not exactly acting like a non-bozo, either;
polite people (who aren't bozos) don't talk about
bozos. In fact, polite people make great bozo hosts,
because they won't be rude to their bozo infesta
tions. Bozos know this.
If someone you've just met seems to take an inex
plicable liking to you, don't attribute it to increased
secretions from your charm gland, it's just the bozo
way of building up guilt for the moment you realize
you don't want to be in its presence another second.
You see, even though bozos have a Jolly Green
Giant perspective of themselves compared to most
other sentient beings, they are dependent on a host
for applause, attention and that crucial contrast
which sets a bozo off as something just a little bit
more susceptible to D-Con 4-Gone than the rest of
humanity.
Which brings us to the Second Law of Bozo
Physics — after the Bozo Constant — which states
that bozos can't exist in a vacuum. If you've been
sitting by yourself, worrying about your bozo ten
dencies, just put a child-proof lid on your chewable
angst tablets. Bozo is a transitive verb; bozos have
to inflict themselves on someone.
A bozo by itself is like pizza topping without any
crust underneath. It's not really a pizza, and from a
distance it looks like any other harmless puddle of
mozzarella lava, but it can still wrap itself around
your waist with the Dentu-Grip bond of "that extra
five pounds" and no amount of lettuce munching
will pry it loose.
No matter how thick-crusted you are, a bozo can
find a way to pester your pasta and otherwise make
you feel like the whole elephant-dung-sawdust
buttered-popcorn circus has come to your town to
stay.
Not to fear, all you have to do is learn the bozo
indicators and then avoid people who exhibit them.
You must have met a bozo or two in your life, so see
if my description fits your recollections.
First, there's Bozospeak, most easily identifiable
by the use of the word, "myself," instead of "I" or
"me," due to the bozo's indecision about which of
the other two forms to use, as in, "John and myself
have three classes together. Isn't that great, John?"
When nothing else is going on in a bozo brain, it
will occupy itself by reciting some of its favorite
words — like, cool, blow off, kegger, moral, dude,
326-6552 — the magical incantations with which it
wins all its friends.
All of this vocabulary forms the idioticon, the
mass of cliched jargon that forms the common lan
guage among bozos worldwide.
You can tell a bozo by that one aspect of its ap
pearance in which it revels, some idiosyncrasy
which it won't be seen in public without — a neon
green pair of simulation Vuarnets, a shiny polyester
Little League windbreaker, an impressively flexed
muscle or supercilious swayback stance — anything
which has less taste than a rice cake.
The Third Law talks about each individual's bozo
coefficient. No one person is a bozo all the time, so
to maintain the Bozo Constant, we all have to share
the bozo burden.
Those people who put "NO BOZOS" stickers on
their windshields are hopeless Utopians. So do your
civic duty; be a bozo.
