# Visiting prof. challenges students
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
The only blacks at (JSC in the mid
-1960s were black athletes, UC-Berkeley
Sociology Prof. Harry Edwards told his
class, and there were so few of them that if
they were seen walking around campus
late at night they would be detained by the
police.
This led to a running joke among the
black athletes, he said, that went some
thing like this:
If the cops stopped you, they would first
throw a football at you. If you fumbled
that, they threw a basketball at you. If you
fumbled that, they would pick you up be
cause there's no way you should be on
campus . . . unless you could run away
from them, which meant that you were on
the track team.
This remark drew delighted laughter
from the 50 students taking Edwards'
SWOPSI course titled "Focus on the Black
Athlete: Hero, Pawn or 20th Century
Gladiator?" The class is a series of lectures
designed to show how sports reflect soci
ety, and it focuses on the black athlete's
role.
Filled with anecdotes, Edwards' lectures
reveal he is no stranger to the potential ex
plosiveness of the issues he discusses. "I've
been controversial for most of my adult
life," he said.
Back in the early '60s, Edwards arrived
at San Jose State University on a scholar
ship in track and basketball. He soon
began to organize the black athletes on
campus because of "the racism that
prevailed there."
"The administration wanted the black
athletes to stay in physical education. If
you wanted to major in something else,
you had to petition. I had to petition to
major in sociology."
Evidently some officials didn't like Ed
wards' restless activism, because Edwards
was subsequently "kicked off' the track
team despite the fact that he was the cap
tain. +
After completing his master's degree at
Cornell University, Edwards returned to
San Jose State as an instructor. There he
resumed his outspoken protests, appealing
to the athletes of the San Jose and Univer
sity of Texas football teams to refuse to
play their scheduled game.
"That was the only time in the history of
NCAA Division I football that a game

(was) cancelled as a result of political
protest," Edwards said.
Fans for and against the athletes' deci
sion were arming themselves, and accord
ing to Edwards, "Before it was over, a cer
tain Gov. (Ronald) Reagan was talking
about calling in the troops to make sure
the game was played."
Apparently, SJSU officials were not
pleased with that turn of events, and Ed
wards was soon fired, with the explanation
that he had become "too big" for the
school.
Edwards' troubles didn't end there.
After finishing his doctorate at Cornell, he
began teaching at UC-Berkeley in 1970.
He said he soon learned of "the collusion
between the university and the FBI to de
termine that my type of behavior would
not be rewarded with a tenured position."
Sound like UC-Berkeley? "Berkeley
behind the barricades is an entirely differ
ent trip from what you see in the media,"
Edwards explained. "Berkeley is a very,
very conservative institution."
Edwards' differences with the adminis
tration exploded into controversy when he
was denied tenure in 1977, a decision that
he fought loudly, drawing reactions from
the White House and editorials in
newspapers throughout the world.
Later that year, for the first time in the
history of a major university, the decision
to deny tenure was overturned.
These days, Edwards is teaching classes
in the field that he founded, the sociology
of sport. And his students here rave about
the SWOPSI course.
"This is probably going to be my favor
ite class this year," said one. Others
praised him as an "inspiring and a vibrant
speaker" and "pretty outspoken and fun.
His size is interesting. You have to watch
him."'
You could hardly miss him. At 6-foot-8
and 270 pounds, Edwards does command
attention. He strides up and down the
front of the classroom, waving his hands
and acting out stereotypes for emphasis.
He listens to students' questions and
answers them seriously — often calling
them "brother" or "sister" and throwing
in a humorous comment.
"Don't call me 'professor' — only my
colleagues call me that. Call me Harry," he
said.
"We're going to talk about some things
and be straightforward. We'll be cool and

learn a lot .. . don't take anything per
sonally," he told the predominately black
class.
Edwards has noticed that the students
love his class. "The reaction has been

overwhelmingly positive. Students came
up and asked if they could bring their
friends, their roommates . . . one student
asked me if he could bring his mom. I said
sure."

Cornell University, Edwards returned to
San Jose State as an instructor. There he
resumed his outspoken protests, appealing
to the athletes of the San Jose and Univer
sity of Texas football teams to refuse to
play their scheduled game.
"That was the only time in the history of
NCAA Division I football that a game

(was) cancelled as a result of political
protest," Edwards said.
Fans for and against the athletes' deci
sion were arming themselves, and accord
ing to Edwards, "Before it was over, a cer
tain Gov. (Ronald) Reagan was talking
about calling in the troops to make sure
the game was played."
Apparently, SJSU officials were not
pleased with that turn of events, and Ed
wards was soon fired, with the explanation
that he had become "too big" for the
school.
Edwards' troubles didn't end there.
After finishing his doctorate at Cornell, he
began teaching at UC-Berkeley in 1970.
He said he soon learned of "the collusion
between the university and the FBI to de
termine that my type of behavior would
not be rewarded with a tenured position."
Sound like UC-Berkeley? "Berkeley
behind the barricades is an entirely differ
ent trip from what you see in the media,"
Edwards explained. "Berkeley is a very,
very conservative institution."
Edwards' differences with the adminis
tration exploded into controversy when he
was denied tenure in 1977, a decision that
he fought loudly, drawing reactions from
the White House and editorials in
newspapers throughout the world.
Later that year, for the first time in the
history of a major university, the decision
to deny tenure was overturned.
These days, Edwards is teaching classes
in the field that he founded, the sociology
of sport. And his students here rave about
the SWOPSI course.
"This is probably going to be my favor
ite class this year," said one. Others
praised him as an "inspiring and a vibrant
speaker" and "pretty outspoken and fun.
His size is interesting. You have to watch
him."'
You could hardly miss him. At 6-foot-8
and 270 pounds, Edwards does command
attention. He strides up and down the
front of the classroom, waving his hands
and acting out stereotypes for emphasis.
He listens to students' questions and
answers them seriously — often calling
them "brother" or "sister" and throwing
in a humorous comment.
"Don't call me 'professor' — only my
colleagues call me that. Call me Harry," he
said.
"We're going to talk about some things
and be straightforward. We'll be cool and

learn a lot .. . don't take anything per
sonally," he told the predominately black
class.
Edwards has noticed that the students
love his class. "The reaction has been

overwhelmingly positive. Students came
up and asked if they could bring their
friends, their roommates . . . one student
asked me if he could bring his mom. I said
sure."

UC-Berkeley Sociology Prof. Harry Edwards, who is teaching a SWOPSI class
this quarter, encourages an informal atmosphere in the class, telling his students
to call him "Harry" instead of "professor."
The only blacks at (JSC in the mid
-1960s were black athletes, UC-Berkeley
Sociology Prof. Harry Edwards told his
class, and there were so few of them that if
they were seen walking around campus
late at night they would be detained by the
police.
This led to a running joke among the
black athletes, he said, that went some
thing like this:
If the cops stopped you, they would first
throw a football at you. If you fumbled
that, they threw a basketball at you. If you
fumbled that, they would pick you up be
cause there's no way you should be on
campus . . . unless you could run away
from them, which meant that you were on
the track team.
This remark drew delighted laughter
from the 50 students taking Edwards'
SWOPSI course titled "Focus on the Black
Athlete: Hero, Pawn or 20th Century
Gladiator?" The class is a series of lectures
designed to show how sports reflect soci
ety, and it focuses on the black athlete's
role.
Filled with anecdotes, Edwards' lectures
reveal he is no stranger to the potential ex
plosiveness of the issues he discusses. "I've
been controversial for most of my adult
life," he said.
Back in the early '60s, Edwards arrived
at San Jose State University on a scholar
ship in track and basketball. He soon
began to organize the black athletes on
campus because of "the racism that
prevailed there."
"The administration wanted the black
athletes to stay in physical education. If
you wanted to major in something else,
you had to petition. I had to petition to
major in sociology."
Evidently some officials didn't like Ed
wards' restless activism, because Edwards
was subsequently "kicked off' the track
team despite the fact that he was the cap
