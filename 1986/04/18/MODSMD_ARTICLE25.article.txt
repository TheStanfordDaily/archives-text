## Author Halberstam blasts collegiate athletics 
### MORTY POSNER Editorial staff JOHN POLLACK 
Denouncing recruiting for collegiate sports as
often "brutal," "cruel" and "shameless,"
Pulitzer-prize winning author David Hal
berstam last night said that college recruiters
who "represent the elite" promise athletes
"everything but an education."
Opening the Stanford Humanities Center's
"Sports, Culture and Society" conference, Hal
berstam, author of two sports books — "The
Breaks of the Game" and"The Amateurs" —
told a group of about 70 at the Tresidder Oak
Lounge that recruiters "venture into the world
of the underclass" and "take what they can get
for two to three years of eligibility."
Halberstam also criticized network television
for being too financially involved in collegiate
sports to report about recruiting abuses.
He cited sportscaster Brent Musberger's wil
lingness during the NCAA basketball tourna
ment to discuss the Duke team's high
percentage of graduating seniors while remain
ing silent about the lower percentages of the
other Final Four teams.
Halberstam also cited sportscaster Howard
Cosell for not reporting the similar abuses on
television and on lower revenue radio.
"(Cosell) tells it like it is on radio but not on
television," Halberstam said.
Halberstam emphasized that collegiate ath
letes should be considered students first and

suggested guidelines to prevent recruiting
abuses.
According to Halberstam, colleges should
publish the percentages of their athletes who
graduate yearly, and when recruiting in ghetto
areas, recruiters should select five other stu
dents who are accomplished in other non
athletic disciplines.
Halberstam said that television "distorted"
and "played with" sports like basketball and
football. He also criticized what he called the
"omr;i-season" of sports in which several sports
seasons coincide.
Lengthened playoff schedules are necessary
to rekindle the interest of fans bored by the
large number of mediocre teams who play
during the regular season, he said.
High television revenues also cause the
"Steinbrennerization" of owners, a term that
Halberstam used to describe how owners and
players are thrust into the celebrity spotlight
rather than the game itself.
Responding to criticisms of television's effect
on sports, Roy Eisenhardt, president of the
Oakland A's, said in a panel discussion follow
ing Halberstam's talk that television coverage of
women's sports helps to provide previously un
available role models for women in sports.
Nancy Ditz, winner of the 1986 Los Angeles
Marathon and a U.S. National Marathon cham
pion, agreed. She noted that TV coverage of the
1984 women's Olympic marathon provided the
opportunity "to see women in this graceful and
powerful sport."
