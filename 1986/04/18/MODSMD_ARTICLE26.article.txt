### LISA HERSCHBACH Staff writer 
More than 15 of the world's foremost scholars and philosophers will
gather at Stanford today and tomorrow to participate in a symposium
entitled "Nietzsche in Italy," sponsored by the University's Department
of French and Italian. The symposium will focus on the reception of
Nietzsche's work in pre- and post-war Italy and on his Turin writings.
"At the turn of the century, during the fascist period, Nietzsche had an
enormous effect in Italy because his language was used to justify fascist
ideology," said Robert Harrison, an Italian professor at Stanford. "And
even in present-day Italy, Nietzsche continues to be the focal point of
what modern Italian philosophers are doing. This justifies a conference
of this sort," he said.
Nietzsche wrote his last five books while living in Italy, before going
mad in Turin in 1889, according to Harrison. "This symposium aims to
inteipret his madness and how it relates to his works. The occasion will
open up a whole new dimension in the study of Nietzsche," Harrison
said.
In addition to four members of the Stanford faculty, distinguished
scholars from all over the nation, as well as from France and Italy, will
speak at the conference.
Among the speakers will be Michel Serres, professor of philosophy at
the Sorbonne in Paris and recent recipient of the Prix Medicis, which
Harrison called "the equivalent to the Pulitzer Prize in America."
Giorgio Agamben, the foremost philosopher in Italy today, according
to Harrison, will also be a panel member. Louis Marin, director of Ecole
des Hautes Etudes, and a philosopher whom Harrison describes as
"world famous for his work on Utopias," will join Serres and Agamben.
All sessions will take place in the auditorium of the Center for Educa
tional Research at Stanford (CERAS). For additional information con
