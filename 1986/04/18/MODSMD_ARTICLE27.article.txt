## Cardinal colors "the Islands" 
### DAVE HETZEL 
Odysseus' jaunt around the Greek isles would
surely have paled in comparison to the trek that
200 Stanford students recently made to Hawaii.
Battling forces that Odysseus had probably not
seen the likes of, such as Rick, the Hawaiian-
Airlines-steward-turned-I aw-enforcement
agent, Stanford students made their way to the
island of Oahu. And with a little luck and a
couple of federal marshals, they returned.
Those who had waited all quarter for the
Hawaii-bound flight had to maintain their com
posure throughout a five-hour flight. Surpris
ingly, the return flight was half-an-hour shorter.
One native islander said the time difference was
due to various tradewinds and true of all flights
to and from Hawaii.
En route to Oahu, one of the seven main is
lands that constitute Hawaii, students with
beach oriented minds prepared themselves for
the island experience, unquestionably better
than any trip to the inferior beaches in south
eastern "back there." And besides, where else
can you get lei'd Hawaiian style within an hour
of arriving.
To the west and slightly north of Oahu lay
Kauai, Nihau and Kaula. While Molokai, Lanai,
Maui and"The Big Island" 1 are southeast of

Oahu. The weather in the Hawaiian islands
tends to be a little more overcast than what the
average tourist expects.
In the Honolulu-Waikiki Beach area where
Stanford students shacked up in the Waikiki
Marina Hotel, there is an annual rainfall of 20
to 50 inches. Luckily, almost no rain dampened
the Stanford stay from March 21 to 28.
The Waikiki Marina was introduced to Stan
ford post-final dorm life and the following
morning eviction was threatened. So everyone
settled down to the serious business of exploring
Waikiki and Honolulu.
With the famous Waikiki Beach only a three
block walk from the hotel, most made it their
first stop. Perhaps one of the nicest places to
stay while vacationing in Waikiki is the Royal
Hawaiian, a relatively older hotel with a unique
architecture which creates an atmosphere the
other modern high-rise hotels lack. Located
within 50 yards of the the surf, the Royal
Hawaiian seems to be a great place to stay, es
pecially if your money is as abundant as those
Ã¼biquitous Macademia nuts.
Many students attended happy hours at
Popo's, Cilly's and Moose McGillycuddy's to
"suck 'em up." With the drinking age at IS, al

most all downed a mai'tai. a staple in Hawaiian
bars.
Then it was off to The Shorebird, The Pink
Cadillac, The Wave or Masquerades for dancing
and romancing. There was even a midweek
booze cruise on which one Stanford female took
first place in the sensuous banana lick contest.
A Stanford male secured third place after losing
his pants in the buns competition. The limelight
also fell on Stanford junior Fred Haberle who
won the Ernest P. Worell imitation contest at
The Wave.
Deathly hunger pangs drove multitudes to
breakfast specials, which abounded. Otners
saved themselves for a MahiMahi burger,
prepared from the indigenous MahiMahi fish.
Some practiced there culinary wizardry and
pounded hotel bologna sandwiches. Island din
ners range anywhere from a 99-cent Wendy's
bacon cheeseburger to elegant Chinese dinners
upwards of $25 and professional luaus that
usually cost about $20.
Hanauma Bay provided scenery other than
awesome figures that students could become
fish-eyed over. Snorkelers could see and feed
dozens of different species of fish and maybe
even a sea turtle or eel. For about $ 10 a day. a
visitor could rent mask, snorkel and fins. Un
derwater cameras were also available. If

travelers have made it all the way to Oahu, they
should not miss Hanauma Bay ... no matter
what their level of snorkeling skill.
Other water sports included surfing at
Waikiki Beach. Although no pipeline waves
ever emerged, the surf was ideal for beginners.
Those seeking the thrill of cliff diving or at least
watching it, ventured to the north side of the is
land.
Among the island bargains were Macadamia
nuts, pineapples, pukka jewelry, which practi
cally grows like mold on vendors stands, and of
course those $1.79 T-shirts. Pineapples could be
purchased and arrangements made so that
mainland-bound travelers could pick their
pineapples up at the airport and not have to
deal with agricultural customs.
Sitting in Honolulu Airport preparing to
depart, thoughts of island summer jobs and
transfer units from the University of Hawaii
danced through many a head. Others con
templated their peeling $350 tans, while those
who had logged in life threatening times of
happy hours, simply slept.
Leader of the pack, Darren Scheider, com
mented on the trip saying, "It was wild.'* Asked
about Hawaii Part 11, Scheider chuckeled, "I
had fun. I hope everyone else did. But I won't
be doing it next year." Till then, MAH ALO!
