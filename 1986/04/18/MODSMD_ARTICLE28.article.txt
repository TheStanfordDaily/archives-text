Nataraja Restaurant serves a delicate Indian haute
cuisine in a beautiful setting, and is a Bay Area dining ex
perience not to he missed.
I guarantee that if you eat there once, you'll want to go
hack.
The Indian restaurant, located on University Avenue in
Palo Alto, opened last May and is currently gearing up for
its first anniversary celebration, featuring special buffet
dinners during the week of May 2.
Nataraja's specialties include an assortment of Tan
doori entrees — fish, lamb chops, king prawns, sheekh
kebab — and several dishes of the North Indian and
Moghlai cuisines. Tandoori dishes are prepared in
"Mesquite" Indian clay ovens and are tender and quite
good.
Though the gourmet often believes that Indian food is
too spicy to be a real delicacy, Nataraja's food is mild and
delicious. Indeed, the restaurant's dishes compare
favorably with specialties of top restaurants in the area.
Equally attractive is its pleasant ambiance. The restau
rant's plain exterior belies its ornate interior, decorated
with plants, instruments and oil sketches. Candles and
fresh flowers on the tables and quiet music contribute to
the atmosphere.
Appetizers ($3 each) include assorted pakoras
(seasoned and batter-fried vegetables with chutney dip),
chicken lollipops (batter-fried spring chicken winglets),
and samosas (tasty triangles of wheat pasta stuffed with
potatoes, peas and spices, deep fried and served with mint
chutney —my favorite). Nataraja offers several salads,
soups, rice dishes and Tandoori breads. The aromatic rice
dishes are extraordinary. One such dish offers layered rich
Indian rice pilaff with chicken or lamb, garnered with
raisins, dried nuts and eggs, and flavored with saffron.
The Tandoori entrees range from $8.75 to $14.75. The
combo dish, at $12.75, offers a taste of each Tandoori
entree, and is reason enough to come to Nataraja.
For the world's sweetest dessert, order the Gulab
Jamun, warm milk dumplings in sugar syrup. Nataraja of
fers several ice creams as well. Each dish costs $3.25.
Finally, Nataraja serves rich coffee in which it takes
great pride.
In addition to daily buffet lunches ($5.95) and
candlelight dinners Tuesday through Saturday, Nataraja
offers a Sunday champagne buffet brunch ($10.95 for
adults, $5.95 forchildren) from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Patrons
can call for reservations for all meals.
The restaurant is offering a 15 percent discount for all
Stanford faculty and students (simply present a school
ID), and a2O percent discount for Stanford groups of four
or more.
