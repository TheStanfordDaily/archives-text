# Compadres: more than a hangout

Compadres on the El Camino is a restaurant
where people can expect a relaxed meal in a casual
setting. Because of this. Compadres has become a
favorite spot of Stanford students. The evening we
ate here a large group of students from a dorm was
seated at a table next to ours and another group
was coming in as we left.
We found that what makes Compadres so
popular is the food, service and atmosphere.
As soon ;us we arrived at the restaurant, we were
promptly seated by a friendly hostess. A basket of
tortilla chips with salsa was set out before us, and
glasses of water filled before the Beaver could say
"Gee. Wally. this is swell!"
We started with drinks and an appetizer of
potato nachos. Potato nachos ($5.95) is definitely

an appetizer for three or more people. Thick, crispy
fried potato slices are served on a large dish with
sour cream, avocado, olives, cheese and everything
else that goes well with nachos. We also ordered a
pinacolada and a margarita from the full bar.
For dinner we ordered the chicken mole (58.95),
carne asada ($12.95) and babyback ribs (512.95).
We thought the chicken mole was a bit dry and
lacked taste. On the other hand, the carne asada, a
grilled steak, seemed to melt in our mouths.
Though they were prepared in smoked ovens, the
baby-back ribs did not have the full richness of
smoked cooking. Yet they were still tasty and
meaty.
We recommend the babyback ribs, but caution
anyone to consider ordering only half of a slab be
cause a full slab is pretty hefty.
We particularly noticed the quality of the service.
Even though we arrived at around 6 p.m. on a
Saturday, we were quickly seated. The time be
tween placing our orders and having our meals
before us was around 15 minutes.
Our waitress was verv friendlv and took and han

died our orders attentively. All around us, busboys
made sure that no water glass stood less than half
full and that the tortilla chips and sauce were
plentiful.
Besides the food and service, atmosphere is also
a strong point at Compadres. We find that it is a
casual place where one could feel comfortable
about taking a date or just enjoying a meal with a
bunch of friends.
The music ranges from reggae, which does not
really fit in with the atmosphere of a Mexican res
taurant. to a strolling trio which does enliven the
setting. The lighting in the restaurant is bright and
amiable.
Compadres is a restaurant where one can depend
on a consistently good meal. On the occasion that
we reviewed the restaurant, we ordered dishes
which we thought were different from the standard
fare of burritos and enchiladas because we knew
from previous experience that Compadres
prepared these dishes well.
For Compadre s good serv ice. casual atmosphere
and reasonable prices for good food, we say. to
quote Joe Bob. "Check it out."
