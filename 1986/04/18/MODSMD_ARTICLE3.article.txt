# 22 protesters are sentenced
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
As the pre-trial proceedings con
tinued yesterday of anti-apartheid
protesters arrested at Old Union sit
ins last October, presiding Municipal
Court Judge Franklin Elia handed
down sentences ranging from four
days in custody to 20 hours of com
munity service.
During the proceedings, 19 stu
dents, one professor and one Palo
Alto resident changed their pleas
from not guilty to no contest to
trespassing charges, while another
student pleaded guilty to similar
charges.
The remaining protester, graduate
student Eric Diesel, deciding to con
tinue his plea of not guilty, still faces
charges of trespassing, unlawful as
sembly and refusal to disperse. The
jury for Diesel's case will be chosen
today, and the trial will begin Mon
day morning.

According to junior Jim Costain,
who was sentenced to two days in
custody, the 22 arrestees who
changed their pleas did so because
"we've had the moral basis of the trial
thrown out/' He referred to Elia's
decision Wednesday to rule out the
arrestees' "necessity defense," which
justifies possible violation of the law
providing the actions were taken to
prevent a greater harm.
"We're refusing a jury trial because
important defenses are not going to
be heard by the jury," Costain said,
adding that theirs was "essentially a
moral case."
Elia gave the arrestees a choice
between three possible sentences.
Fifteen students chose custody at the
Elmwood County Jail starting at 3
p.m. yesterday; Statistics Prof.
Charles Stein chose two weekends of
enforced work for the county starting
May 17; and four students committed
to a set number of hours of approved
community service to be completed
by June 2.
The longest term in custody was
given to sophomore David Romo,
who will serve four days for trespass
ing, with the fifth day credited to time
served. Romo faces a stiffer sentence
than the other protesters because this
was his second conviction of the same
offense in front of the same judge.
Delivering a statement before re
ceiving his sentence, Romo said his
participation in the protests was
"telling America's powerful that they
have blood on their hands" as a result
of their unwillingness to divest from
companies doing business in South
Africa.
Sophomore Peter Heslin was sen
tenced to four days in custody, two of
which were credited to time served,
because he was arrested for trespass
ing on two separate occasions in the
October protests. Before receiving
his sentence, Heslin charged that al
though Elia was "playing a role" as
judge, "that role should be changed"
to allow moral issues to be considered
as a viable defense.
"I do not accept this as a fair and
just trial," Heslin said, adding that he
would accept only a jail term because
the alternative of community service
is a "euphemism just like
'constructive engagement.' "
Others sentenced to two days in
custody were Palo Alto resident Rob
Levitsky and seniors Glenn Baker,
David Pan and Brad Hightower. Sen
tenced to one day in custody, with
one day credited to time served, were
graduate students Cam Baker and
Rick Motamedi; seniors Lisa Price,
Romney Peterson, Lisa Ruben and
Ronny Nissimov; junior Mary Poxon;
and sophomore David Potter.
Stein, accepting his sentence to two
work weekends, said the "immediate
motive" for his participation in the
protests was "the beating of Robby

Perkins." He added that he "had con
sidered acting against apartheid for
some time" before the October inci
dent, and that he hoped his actions
"would lead other faculty members to
take action."
Sentenced to 20 hours of commu
nity service to be completed by June
2 were juniors Warren Habib and
Council of Presidents (COP) member
Tim Quirk; and COP member Mike
Collins, a senior. This sentence in
cludes a year's probation, which can
be requested to be repealed after the
arrestees have proven completion of
their 20 hours of community service.
COP member Andy Frisch, the
only one of the 23 arrestees to plead
guilty, agreed to a sentence of 40
hours of community service, with the
same probation stipulations as those
sentenced to 20 hours. Before accept
ing his sentence, Frisch, a junior, told
the court that "rational discourse
should occur between the people in
power (the University administra
tion) and those who live under that
power (Stanford students)."
Senior Robby Perkins, who is
pursuing a civil suit concerning al
leged police brutality during arrests at
the Oct. 14 sit-in, was sentenced to
two days custody, which were both
credited to the time served in Octo
ber. Speaking of those arrestees who
were taken to jail yesterday, Perkins
said, "It shows how little the Univer
sity cares about its students, that (the
administration) let them be taken to
jail."
