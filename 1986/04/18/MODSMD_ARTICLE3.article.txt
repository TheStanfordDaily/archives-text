As the pre-trial proceedings con
tinued yesterday of anti-apartheid
protesters arrested at Old Union sit
ins last October, presiding Municipal
Court Judge Franklin Elia handed
down sentences ranging from four
days in custody to 20 hours of com

During the proceedings, 19 stu

trespassing charges, while another
student pleaded guilty to similar
charges.
The remaining protester, graduate
student Eric Diesel, deciding to con
tinue his plea of not guilty, still faces
charges of trespassing, unlawful as
sembly and refusal to disperse. The
jury for Diesel's case will be chosen
today, and the trial will begin Mon
day morning.

According to junior Jim Costain,
who was sentenced to two days in
custody, the 22 arrestees who
changed their pleas did so because
"we've had the moral basis of the trial
thrown out/' He referred to Elia's
decision Wednesday to rule out the
arrestees' "necessity defense," which
justifies possible violation of the law
providing the actions were taken to
prevent a greater harm.
"We're refusing a jury trial because
important defenses are not going to
be heard by the jury," Costain said,
adding that theirs was "essentially a
moral case."
Elia gave the arrestees a choice
between three possible sentences.
Fifteen students chose custody at the
Elmwood County Jail starting at 3
p.m. yesterday; Statistics Prof.
Charles Stein chose two weekends of
enforced work for the county starting
May 17; and four students committed
