# Carmel B&B supplies comfort of your own home
## 
### MIKE MADISON 
Like most well-run, comfortable
establishments in this area, the Sea
View Inn in Carmel has a Stanford
connection. Over the past 1 1
years, Stanford grads Diane and
Marshall Hydorn have completely
refurbished an 80-year-old Vic
torian house in the middle of a
tree-lined beachfront neighbor
hood.
The Sea View has eight rooms,
some merely comfortable, some
truly elegant, two sitting rooms
with fireplaces, a generous front
porch and a garden in back. No
hot tubs. No television. No cham
pagne when you arrive. No Clint
Eastwood. The Sea View has
humanity, and it has it for a
reasonable price.
We arrived on a sunny Saturday
afternoon. The weekend manager.
Janet, was struggling to keep up
with the flood of phone calls arriv
ing at the Sea View. Janet was
Carmel's "host" that day.
("Hosting" duty rotates among all
the inns and lodges in Carmel and
Carmel Valley: the host each day
operates a clearinghouse for all
unbooked rooms in the area.)
She escorted us to a smallish but
comfortable third-floor room that
had an ocean view, a private bath
(shower, no tub) and a queen-size
bed made up with two handmade
quilts. A small refrigerator
beneath the staircase on the first
floor holds cold drinks (payment is
on the honor system), and we took
a pair and sat out on the deck
chairs on the porch for a few
hours.
A brief tour of the house and
some of the other rooms revealed
the innkeepers' touch everywhere.
The house apparently was de
signed (for you architecture buffs)
by Bernard Maybeck just after the
great San Francisco earthquake in
1906 and is hardly a latecomer to
the bed-and-breakfast boom.
The Sea View has been welcom
ing overnight guests for more than
60 years. The Hydorns have in
stalled fresh hardwood floors and
repainted, wallpapered, carpeted
and furnished the whole place.
The third floor will be completely
remodeled (again) next fall, with
the addition of dormer windows.
We saw two of the second floor
rooms, both with private baths and
window seats. One had a canopied
bed, a view of the ocean and an
old-fashioned bathtub with feet:
the other boasted a fourposter bed
and a small sitting room of its own
overlooking the garden. On the
night we stayed there, the first was
taken by a couple on their second
anniversary, the second by two
people on their honeymoon.
Late in the afternoon we walked
the three blocks from the Sea
View to the beach and watched
surfers surf and tourists tour.

When we got back, Janet had set
out the evening's complimentary
bottle of sherry. Glasses in hand,
we enjoyed a small fire burning in
the fireplace, and played back
gammon on a beautiful solid wood
game table.
Also available was a basket
filled with menus from Carmel,
Pacific Grove and Monterey res
taurants. Janet offered the names
of her own favorites and volun
teered to make reservations for us
where she could. (Note: In addi
tion to making your overnight
reservations well ahead of time,
make restaurant reservations too,
where possible.
The Sea View is only five blocks
from Ocean Avenue, Carmel's
main street, and seven blocks from
the edge of the business district.
We ate at a tiny European place in
Carmel called La Boheme, which
offers a different fixed menu every
night and does not accept reserva
tions. At about $15 per person,
the food was terrific, the single
room a bit overcrowded and the
service quite aggressive.
We returned for a sound night's
sleep and awoke to the smell of
freshly baked muffins. Breakfast
each morning consists of Diane's
baking, plus cereals, fruit, juice
and coffee/tea/etc. We were for
tunate enough to be there for Sun
day breakfast and each week's
special meal: homemade quiche.
Diane poured the coffee, intro
ducing herself to the guests as they
came down.
We left soon after breakfast to
return to the Bay Area, noticing
on our way out that the water
colors along the stairwell were
painted by Marshall.
What struck us throughout was
the sense that the Sea View is a
bed-and-breakfast true to the
original idea — the Hydorns have
been running the inn since long
before it became fashionable to go
off for a weekend to some
luxurious retreat, and it feels most
of all like they have opened up
their own home each night to a
small group of particularly lucky
and special people.
Like all homes, it can be many
things. It is an inexpensive yet
comfortable place to stay while
visiting the peninsula. It is a quiet
and warm place to read and relax,
to "get away from it all" as its pa
trons did 60 years ago when the
Sea View sat on an empty bluff.
The Sea View Inn is located on
Camino Real between 1 Ith and
12th Streets. It features eight
rooms, six with private bath ($55
to $85 per night) and two with
shared bath ($4B per night). Rates
increase $3 per room on June 1.
No pets, no smoking indoors and
no children under 12. For reserva
tions. write P.O. Box 4138, Car
mel, CA 93921 or call <408)624-
8778.

of all like they have opened up
their own home each night to a
small group of particularly lucky
and special people.
Like all homes, it can be many
things. It is an inexpensive yet
comfortable place to stay while
visiting the peninsula. It is a quiet
and warm place to read and relax,
to "get away from it all" as its pa
trons did 60 years ago when the
Sea View sat on an empty bluff.
The Sea View Inn is located on
Camino Real between 1 Ith and
12th Streets. It features eight
rooms, six with private bath ($55
to $85 per night) and two with
shared bath ($4B per night). Rates
increase $3 per room on June 1.
No pets, no smoking indoors and
no children under 12. For reserva
tions. write P.O. Box 4138, Car
mel, CA 93921 or call <408)624-
8778.
Like most well-run, comfortable
establishments in this area, the Sea
View Inn in Carmel has a Stanford
connection. Over the past 1 1
years, Stanford grads Diane and
Marshall Hydorn have completely
refurbished an 80-year-old Vic
torian house in the middle of a
tree-lined beachfront neighbor
hood.
The Sea View has eight rooms,
some merely comfortable, some
truly elegant, two sitting rooms
with fireplaces, a generous front
porch and a garden in back. No
hot tubs. No television. No cham
pagne when you arrive. No Clint
Eastwood. The Sea View has
humanity, and it has it for a
reasonable price.
We arrived on a sunny Saturday
afternoon. The weekend manager.
Janet, was struggling to keep up
with the flood of phone calls arriv
ing at the Sea View. Janet was
Carmel's "host" that day.
("Hosting" duty rotates among all
the inns and lodges in Carmel and
Carmel Valley: the host each day
operates a clearinghouse for all
unbooked rooms in the area.)
She escorted us to a smallish but
comfortable third-floor room that
had an ocean view, a private bath
(shower, no tub) and a queen-size
bed made up with two handmade
quilts. A small refrigerator
beneath the staircase on the first
floor holds cold drinks (payment is
on the honor system), and we took
a pair and sat out on the deck
chairs on the porch for a few
hours.
A brief tour of the house and
some of the other rooms revealed
the innkeepers' touch everywhere.
The house apparently was de
signed (for you architecture buffs)
by Bernard Maybeck just after the
great San Francisco earthquake in
1906 and is hardly a latecomer to
the bed-and-breakfast boom.
The Sea View has been welcom
ing overnight guests for more than
60 years. The Hydorns have in
stalled fresh hardwood floors and
repainted, wallpapered, carpeted
and furnished the whole place.
The third floor will be completely
remodeled (again) next fall, with
the addition of dormer windows.
We saw two of the second floor
rooms, both with private baths and
window seats. One had a canopied
bed, a view of the ocean and an
old-fashioned bathtub with feet:
the other boasted a fourposter bed
and a small sitting room of its own
overlooking the garden. On the
night we stayed there, the first was
taken by a couple on their second
anniversary, the second by two
people on their honeymoon.
Late in the afternoon we walked
the three blocks from the Sea
View to the beach and watched
surfers surf and tourists tour.

When we got back, Janet had set
out the evening's complimentary
bottle of sherry. Glasses in hand,
we enjoyed a small fire burning in
the fireplace, and played back
gammon on a beautiful solid wood
game table.
Also available was a basket
filled with menus from Carmel,
Pacific Grove and Monterey res
taurants. Janet offered the names
of her own favorites and volun
teered to make reservations for us
where she could. (Note: In addi
tion to making your overnight
reservations well ahead of time,
make restaurant reservations too,
where possible.
The Sea View is only five blocks
from Ocean Avenue, Carmel's
main street, and seven blocks from
the edge of the business district.
We ate at a tiny European place in
Carmel called La Boheme, which
offers a different fixed menu every
night and does not accept reserva
tions. At about $15 per person,
the food was terrific, the single
room a bit overcrowded and the
service quite aggressive.
We returned for a sound night's
sleep and awoke to the smell of
freshly baked muffins. Breakfast
each morning consists of Diane's
baking, plus cereals, fruit, juice
and coffee/tea/etc. We were for
tunate enough to be there for Sun
day breakfast and each week's
special meal: homemade quiche.
Diane poured the coffee, intro
ducing herself to the guests as they
came down.
We left soon after breakfast to
return to the Bay Area, noticing
on our way out that the water
colors along the stairwell were
painted by Marshall.
What struck us throughout was
the sense that the Sea View is a
bed-and-breakfast true to the
original idea — the Hydorns have
been running the inn since long
before it became fashionable to go
off for a weekend to some
luxurious retreat, and it feels most
of all like they have opened up
their own home each night to a
small group of particularly lucky
and special people.
