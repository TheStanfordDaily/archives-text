### Atul Gawande, John Wallin Telford Work 
Selected tracks from these new
releases will be played Monday night
at 6 on K/.SU-FM (90.1). This week's
ratings system is in favorite phrases
recently exchanged between University
President Donald Kennedy and Politi
cal Science Prof. John Manley.
The Art of Noise: u ln Visible Silence"
. .increasingly more authoritar
ian under (Kennedy's) regime."
. .increasingly more authoritar
ian under (Kennedy's) regime."

. .increasingly more
authoritarian under (Kennedy's)
regime."
. .increasingly more authoritar
ian under (Kennedy's) regime."
In case you happen to fall into the
category of music fans who only like
Good Good Music, you probably
aren't yet aware of The Art of Noise,
who are the uncontested Kings of
Good Awful Music. If the Beatles'
"Revolution 9" were recorded today,

it'd he done up digitally by these
guys.
In Art s first and second releases,
no machine or snippet of uttered
prose was safe from emulator pur
gatory and eternal "r-re-remix
ximer" limbo. Industrial nightmares
became teen dance hits: car ignitions
were transformed into beatbox
choruses: and there was no lyrical
message in sight.
On this, the band's third release,
things are somewhat different. The
effects are more refined than before,
though they're still in the same ball
park as those earlier snippets of
noise.
Danceability is down, monotony
and political conscience
("Instruments of Darkness" seems to
deal with South Africa) are up. The
songs are more complex and layered
than before, so one listen won't be
sufficient to satisfy.
In fact, after one listen you'll prob
ably be ready to take an icepick to the
record, whether or not you've taken it
off your turntable at the time.
Don't do it. Tie yourself down and
listen over and over and over again.
Laurie Anderson: "Home of the
Brave"
"To escape that reality, you have
invented an oppressor."
"To escape that reality, you have
invented an oppressor."
"To escape that reality, you have
invented an oppressor."
"To escape that reality. ..
If you've never been able to stand
Laurie Anderson, you might as well
disregard this because her new al
bum, a soundtrack for her upcoming
film, is not substantially different

from previous albums.
After all, her stuff is "art," not
music you can go jogging to. Much of
the difficulty in making another al
bum like this is lapsing into reworking
old themes and old styles so that it
becomes just plain boring.
But in "Home of the Brave," An
derson manages to maintain the
vitality of her previous albums ("Big
Science," "Mister Heartbreak" and
the live mega-set "United States") by
continuing to come up with vignettes
of human idiosyncrasies that simulta
neously puzzle us and make us laugh.
The approach works largely be
cause of her incredible timing and her
ability to take our ordinary, everyday
phrases and twist them around just
enough to make a mockery of our
existence.
For the first time, she attempts a
more musical approach than in earlier
albums, adding backing singers and
musicians including Adrian Belew on
guitar. This is only partially effective.
Her creativity fails to be captured in
the music, as it clearly is in her voice
and words. At times, she is strangely
melodic, but it is then that she loses
her effectiveness as a detached com
mentator on the human experience.
Pet Shop Boys: u Please"
"Stanford acts more and more like
a big business."
"Stanford acts more and more like
a big business."
"Stanford acts more and more like
a big business."
It took 'em three years and several
radically different versions of a pro
posed hit single, but the Pet Shop
Boys finally have an album. Phew! At
least they did something right — in its

primitive state, all "West End Girls"
could do was be the hippest of the hip
on long-dead "Rock of the '80s" sta
tions.
But the new and improved version
was picked up like all get-out; even
KSUX ("Smokin' Hot Hits") added
it, and has now also picked up the
follow-up single, "Opportunities
(Let's Make Lots of Money)."
What the Pets' impending success
really means, though, is that those of
us who liked their sound back when
they were cool either have to find an
excuse to still like them or dump
them for someone who hasn't been
discovered yet.
So let's see. Why do we like the
band? They're fashionable, their hair
never gets mussed in their videos, and
their mushy, grandiose mega
instrumentation is easy on the diges

tion after a food service lunch. And
yes, Virginia, the English, made-for-
MTV, undermusical/overproduced
Bronski-Goes-To-Spandau style that
rules Hollywood balance sheets runs
rampant, too.
Hey, it could be worse.
Why else do we like the Boys?
Their songs are pointless, contrived
and all sound alike. Their drum tracks
are synthesized. There are 99 pictures
of the band members on the album
jacket, and there are only two band
members to start with.
Overall, then, we like the PSBs for
the same reasons you do. Their in
nocuous, teeny-yup songs are pleas
ant for now — so why not give them a
moment to bask in the glory of Zoo
Picks praise?

"Stanford acts more and more like

It took 'em three years and several
radically different versions of a pro
posed hit single, but the Pet Shop
Boys finally have an album. Phew! At
least they did something right — in its

primitive state, all "West End Girls"
could do was be the hippest of the hip
on long-dead "Rock of the '80s" sta
tions.
But the new and improved version
was picked up like all get-out; even
KSUX ("Smokin' Hot Hits") added
it, and has now also picked up the
follow-up single, "Opportunities
(Let's Make Lots of Money)."
What the Pets' impending success
really means, though, is that those of
us who liked their sound back when
they were cool either have to find an
excuse to still like them or dump
them for someone who hasn't been
discovered yet.
So let's see. Why do we like the
band? They're fashionable, their hair
never gets mussed in their videos, and
their mushy, grandiose mega
instrumentation is easy on the diges

tion after a food service lunch. And
yes, Virginia, the English, made-for-
MTV, undermusical/overproduced
Bronski-Goes-To-Spandau style that
rules Hollywood balance sheets runs
rampant, too.
Hey, it could be worse.
Why else do we like the Boys?
Their songs are pointless, contrived
and all sound alike. Their drum tracks
are synthesized. There are 99 pictures
of the band members on the album
jacket, and there are only two band
members to start with.
Overall, then, we like the PSBs for
the same reasons you do. Their in
nocuous, teeny-yup songs are pleas
ant for now — so why not give them a
moment to bask in the glory of Zoo
Picks praise?

Selected tracks from these new
releases will be played Monday night
at 6 on K/.SU-FM (90.1). This week's
ratings system is in favorite phrases
recently exchanged between University
President Donald Kennedy and Politi
cal Science Prof. John Manley.

In case you happen to fall into the
category of music fans who only like
Good Good Music, you probably
aren't yet aware of The Art of Noise,
who are the uncontested Kings of
Good Awful Music. If the Beatles'
"Revolution 9" were recorded today,

it'd he done up digitally by these
guys.
In Art s first and second releases,
no machine or snippet of uttered
prose was safe from emulator pur
gatory and eternal "r-re-remix
ximer" limbo. Industrial nightmares
became teen dance hits: car ignitions
were transformed into beatbox
choruses: and there was no lyrical
message in sight.
On this, the band's third release,
things are somewhat different. The
effects are more refined than before,
though they're still in the same ball
park as those earlier snippets of
noise.
Danceability is down, monotony
and political conscience
("Instruments of Darkness" seems to
deal with South Africa) are up. The
songs are more complex and layered
than before, so one listen won't be
sufficient to satisfy.
In fact, after one listen you'll prob
ably be ready to take an icepick to the
record, whether or not you've taken it
off your turntable at the time.
Don't do it. Tie yourself down and
listen over and over and over again.
Laurie Anderson: "Home of the

If you've never been able to stand
Laurie Anderson, you might as well
disregard this because her new al
bum, a soundtrack for her upcoming
film, is not substantially different

from previous albums.
After all, her stuff is "art," not
music you can go jogging to. Much of
the difficulty in making another al
bum like this is lapsing into reworking
old themes and old styles so that it
becomes just plain boring.
But in "Home of the Brave," An
derson manages to maintain the
vitality of her previous albums ("Big
Science," "Mister Heartbreak" and
the live mega-set "United States") by
continuing to come up with vignettes
of human idiosyncrasies that simulta
neously puzzle us and make us laugh.
The approach works largely be
cause of her incredible timing and her
ability to take our ordinary, everyday
phrases and twist them around just
enough to make a mockery of our
existence.
For the first time, she attempts a
more musical approach than in earlier
albums, adding backing singers and
musicians including Adrian Belew on
guitar. This is only partially effective.
Her creativity fails to be captured in
the music, as it clearly is in her voice
and words. At times, she is strangely
melodic, but it is then that she loses
her effectiveness as a detached com
mentator on the human experience.
