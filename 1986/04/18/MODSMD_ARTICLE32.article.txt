Yojimbo (1961)
Pagoda Theatre, San Francisco
The opening scene of Akira
Kurosawa's 21st movie is a tribute to
American Westerns ("High Noon"
in particular): Sanjuro (Toshiru
Mifune) stalks bravely up and down
the street of a small town while
everyone else hides. But Kurosawa
charges this scene, and indeed the
whole movie, with his own auda
cious blend of comedy and horror —
a dog trots indifferently through the
street carrying a human hand in its
mouth. This hilarious mock-Western
about a mercenary in mid- 19th cen
tury Japan who hires himself out to
the terrified men on both sides of a
civil war ("Yojimbo" means "the
bodyguard") influenced Sergio
Leone's spaghetti Westerns and pos
sibly Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" as well (both Kurosawa and
Penn mix comedy and violence and
arrive at surprising results). And in
turn it was influenced by John Ford
and Howard Hawks — though what
is most entertaining about
"Yojimbo" are the ways in which
Kurosawa reverses our Western-fed
expectations. Sanjuro is the only
man of courage on the screen; the
others are frightened, ineffectual in
sects. Appropriately, Toshiro
Mifune underplays skillfully while
all the other actors (Eijiro Tono,
Kamatari Fujiwata, Takashi
Shimura, Seizaburo Kawazu, Isuzu
Yamada) do wildly funny bur
lesques, their faces frozen in pain
and anger like gargoyles.

music by Masaru Sato.
Plays Tuesday with "The Bad
Sleep Well."
Midnight Express (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The tale of Billy Hayes, who was
put in a Turkish jail for attempting
to smuggle hash out of the country,
has been turned into a lurid piece of
audience manipulation by director

Alan Parker and screenwriter Oliver
Stone. Parker has no compunctions
about interpolating the sound of a
racing heartbeat into the soundtrack
to rev up the suspense, or employing
a glossy tabloid style for the prison
scenes. When it was released, this
shameful movie pretended to be a
plea for reform: A postscript
proclaimed that it had opened the
door for negotiations between the
United States and Turkey about the
release of American prisoners. You
got the idea that the purveyors of
this most crass slice of Hollywood
commercialism were actually buck
ing for a Nobel Peace Prize. With
Brad Davis as Billy, John Hurt,
Randy Quaid, Bo Hopkins, Mike
Kellin and Paul Smith.
Plays Wednesday through Friday
with "Kiss of the Spider Woman."
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish arisotocracy in pre-war Fer
rara; this movie, adapted by Giorgio
Bassani and Vittorio De Sica from
Bassani's semi-autobiographical
novel, shows us the last gasps of that
aristocracy, before Mussolini
snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid —
images whirl in your head years after
you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback
for De Sica, whose films after his
neo-realist masterpieces had been
disappointments. It was a triumph,
but his last; he was dead by 1974.
Dominique Sanda (whose beauty is
other-worldly) and Helmut Berger
play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays this Wednesday with "The
Tin Drum."
Jewel of the Nile (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
This sequel to "Romancing the
Stone" is a rather dry, redundant

reworking of the tricks in the
original. Joan Wilder and Jack Col
ton (Kathleen Turner and Michael
Douglas again) are on their world
cruise, and, as a fairytale couple,
they need a fairytale adventure to
give their relationship a boost. It
comes in the form of a sinisterly
charming prince (Spiros Focas). The
silly, clumsily staged reprise of the
original's opening sequence sets the
tone for the rest of the movie, and
Danny DeVito's one-note perfor
mance from "Romancing" is given
more play here. This is symptomatic
of producer and star Douglas' sense
of humor and creativity. Directed by
Lewis Teague and written by Mark
Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner,
who mostly discard the female sen
sibility of the original.
Plays Sunday.
Young Sherlock Holmes (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Barry Levinson
("Diner") tries to be Steven Speil
berg in this tired piece of adventure
juvenilia; it's a bizarre misapplica
tion of Levinson's considerable tal
ents. The movie was written by Chris
Columbus ("Gremlins,"
"Goonies"), who blatantly steals the
evil religious cult plot from "Indiana
Jones" and mines parts of his earlier
scripts as well. (It's far, far too early
in his career for Columbus to be
repeating himself — we may think
he has nothing but kiddy adventures
in his head.) Fortunately, the
filmmakers found some appealing
young performers for the lead roles:
Nicholas Rowe plays a tall, some
what frail-looking, intensely intel
lectual Holmes; Alan Cox uncannily
perfect as the befuddled Watson;
Sophie Ward is the likeable heroine
(she looks like a young Amy Irving,
and, amusingly, Rowe looks like a
young, lanky Speilberg). Levinson
can't do much with the action
scenes, but there's some nicely
realized period detail and a couple
of quite effective hallucinatory hor
rors.
Plays Sunday with "101 Dalma
tions."
The Deer Hunter (1978)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Michael Cimino's astonishingly
powerful (and extremely contover
sial) movie about the effects of a
Vietnamese POW camp on three
buddies from a Pennsylvania steel
town gives off both left-wing and
right-wing vibrations. Politically it's
a mess, and it is fueled by a particu
larly inscrutable brand of machismo,
but Cimino and Deric Washburn
(who collaborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt to
grapple with the Vietnam experi
ence. The film flounders out of an
understandable inability to assim

ilate a far too recent nightmare; it
isn't a hard sell (as many outraged
critics have claimed). As the sur
vivor, Michael, Robert De Niro
gives a supremely intelligent reading
of a tough, closed-off role, but the
most memorable performances are
by Christopher Walken as his best
friend and Meryl Streep as the
woman they share. With John
Savage and the late John Cazale.
Vilmos Zsigmond's meticulous
cinematography helps to keep you
interested through the overlong
opening stateside section.
Plays tommorow with "Coming
Home."
The Trip to Bountiful (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Watching this Peter Masterson
film of a Horton Foote 1953 teleplay
is like experiencing sensory depriva
tion. Since nothing surprising or dra
matic ever happens, the movie has a
drawn-out quality, yet people might
feel comfortable with it precisely be
cause, like TV, it doesn't demand
one's full attention. The story is
about grandmotherly Carrie Watts,
who journeys to her hometown of
Bountiful, Texas, where she hopes
to recapture a more pleasant and
prosperous past. Geraldine Page's
Oscar for her performance here Is a
dubious distinction; she scores
points for acting sly and cute, but her
role is not, to put it kindly, one
which an actor can grow in. Foote's
material is not just repetitive, it's old
hat from the beginning; it's grand
mother schtick. The pace is torpid,
and Masterson's directing style is so
static and enervating that the editing
glitches — cutting away from or to a
character too soon — stick out a
mile. With John Heard, Carlin
Glynn and Richard Bradford.
Plays this week with "Kiss of the
Spider Woman."
Terms of Endearment (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jack Nicholson dominates this
James Brooks movie by playing
against his role as Garrett
Breedlove, a slightly seedy
astronaut. The movie, which began
life as an oddball 1975 novel by
Larry McMurty, is essentially a story
about the delicate balance two
strong women, Aurora and Emma
Greenway, preserve in their mother
daughter relationship; all the men in
their lives — husbands and lovers —
are weak and rather pathetic. (You
sense that McMurtry and Brooks
think there's something sexy about
ineffectual men.) Brooks really
takes his tone from the last 50 pages
of the novel, in which Emma learns
she has cancer, and audiences
respond to his movie because it
makes them weep. Debra Winger is
terrific as Emma — she's zesty in a

loose, improvisatory style — but
Shirley MacLaine, as Aurora, ap
pears somewhat hard and sharp and
unsympathetic: her timing is just
about perfect, but she doesn't show
a great deal of depth. The film has a
number of good sequences, and a
lovely cameo by John Lithgow, but
Brooks is not a director yet (Oscar
or no Oscar), and much of what he
does here is fairly shameless. With
Jeff Daniels as Emma's husband,
Flap.
Plays tonight with "Twice in a
Lifetime."
Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Director Hector Babenco's
adaptation of Manuel Puig's 1976
novel works on the audience in dis
appointingly obvious ways. Both
movie and book are set in a prison
cell in an unnamed South American
country, where Valentin (Raul
Julia), a Marxist revolutionary, is
beaten and questioned regularly by
the guards. He's cared for by his
cellmate Molina (William Hurt), a
homosexual imprisoned for corrupt
ing a minor, who attempts to enter
tain Valentin and himself with an
elaborate telling of a romantic 1940s
Nazi propaganda film. The novel is
about fantasy and escapism, and the
loving/manipulative relationship of
Molina and Valentin, but the movie
gives the material an artsy
sentimental gloss that flattens the
characters and the book's meanings.
Hurt is wonderful in his role, though
Molina's flighty romanticism is not
quite within his range. Leonard
Schrader wrote the screenplay.
Featuring Sonia Braga in a dual role
and Hereon Capri.
Plays this week with "The Trip to
Bountiful."
Out of Africa (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adapta
tion of Isak Dinesen's memoir suf
fers from an excess of tastefulness
and respect for its subject, and the
two stare — Meryl Streep as Dinesen
and Robert Redford as her lover,
Denys Finch Hatton — don't display
a single romantic impulse; they
never connect with each other (or
the audience) emotionally. The
movie begins as Dinesen marries the
Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke (a
marvelous Klaus Maria Brandauer)
— she seemingly for the title, he
expressly for the money — and to
gether they start a coffee plantation
in British East Africa in 1914. She
soon drops this adulterous playboy
husband and becomes involved with
hunter and , ide Finch Hatton.
Dinesen was a skilled enough writer
to engage one emotionally at the
same time she was turninc her expe

riences into an unabashed romantic
idyll. Pollack doesn't display a com
parable skill, and he adamantly
refuses to whip up any excitement or
tension. Streep gives another per
fectly polished, technically accom
plished performance that fails to
suggest any inner life to her charac
ter, but the film's biggest problems
lie with Redford. He has taken to
playing ideals, and here he is meant
to be the wild, unconquerable spirit
of Africa. In this film (as in "The
Natural") Redford floats above the
other actors, swathed in a gauzy aura
that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a
more energetic supporting perfor
mance.
Plays this week
Twice in a Lifetime (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This family drama about adultery
and divorce uses 1970s self-analysis
pedantry to justify 1950s (and
1980s) small-town family and com
munity cliches, making it a truly in
tolerable hybrid. Gene Hackman is
Harry, a Seattle steelworker who
abandons his family for a barmaid
(Ann-Margret), and the movie
presents his bailing out as the best
solution for everybody. Colin Wel
land's script also puts this family's
aggressively middle-class values on a
pedestal, so both Harry and we
aren't meant to question them, we're
meant to admire them. The movie
avoids all ugly emotions by cutting
away from the key confrontational
scenes, because otherwise we might
not buy its pop psycho-platitudes
about life, love and fulfillment. For a
great movie on the same theme, see
"Shoot the Moon." Directed by Bud
Yorkin, with Ellen Burstyn as the
drippy-devoted wife, Amy Madigan
as the upset daughter, Ally Sheedy
and Brian Dennehy.
Plays tonight with "Terms of En
dearment."

("Diner") tries to be Steven Speil
berg in this tired piece of adventure
juvenilia; it's a bizarre misapplica
tion of Levinson's considerable tal
ents. The movie was written by Chris
Columbus ("Gremlins,"
"Goonies"), who blatantly steals the
evil religious cult plot from "Indiana
Jones" and mines parts of his earlier
scripts as well. (It's far, far too early
in his career for Columbus to be
repeating himself — we may think
he has nothing but kiddy adventures
in his head.) Fortunately, the
filmmakers found some appealing
young performers for the lead roles:
Nicholas Rowe plays a tall, some
what frail-looking, intensely intel
lectual Holmes; Alan Cox uncannily
perfect as the befuddled Watson;
Sophie Ward is the likeable heroine
(she looks like a young Amy Irving,
and, amusingly, Rowe looks like a
young, lanky Speilberg). Levinson
can't do much with the action
scenes, but there's some nicely
realized period detail and a couple
of quite effective hallucinatory hor
rors.
Plays Sunday with "101 Dalma

The Deer Hunter (1978)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Michael Cimino's astonishingly
powerful (and extremely contover
sial) movie about the effects of a
Vietnamese POW camp on three
buddies from a Pennsylvania steel
town gives off both left-wing and
right-wing vibrations. Politically it's
a mess, and it is fueled by a particu
larly inscrutable brand of machismo,
but Cimino and Deric Washburn
(who collaborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt to
grapple with the Vietnam experi
ence. The film flounders out of an
understandable inability to assim

ilate a far too recent nightmare; it
isn't a hard sell (as many outraged
critics have claimed). As the sur
vivor, Michael, Robert De Niro
gives a supremely intelligent reading
of a tough, closed-off role, but the
most memorable performances are
by Christopher Walken as his best
friend and Meryl Streep as the
woman they share. With John
Savage and the late John Cazale.
Vilmos Zsigmond's meticulous
cinematography helps to keep you
interested through the overlong
opening stateside section.
Plays tommorow with "Coming
Home."
The Trip to Bountiful (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Watching this Peter Masterson
film of a Horton Foote 1953 teleplay
is like experiencing sensory depriva
tion. Since nothing surprising or dra
matic ever happens, the movie has a
drawn-out quality, yet people might
feel comfortable with it precisely be
cause, like TV, it doesn't demand
one's full attention. The story is
about grandmotherly Carrie Watts,
who journeys to her hometown of
Bountiful, Texas, where she hopes
to recapture a more pleasant and
prosperous past. Geraldine Page's
Oscar for her performance here Is a
dubious distinction; she scores
points for acting sly and cute, but her
role is not, to put it kindly, one
which an actor can grow in. Foote's
material is not just repetitive, it's old
hat from the beginning; it's grand
mother schtick. The pace is torpid,
and Masterson's directing style is so
static and enervating that the editing
glitches — cutting away from or to a
character too soon — stick out a
mile. With John Heard, Carlin
Glynn and Richard Bradford.
Plays this week with "Kiss of the
Spider Woman."
Terms of Endearment (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jack Nicholson dominates this
James Brooks movie by playing
against his role as Garrett
Breedlove, a slightly seedy
astronaut. The movie, which began
life as an oddball 1975 novel by
Larry McMurty, is essentially a story
about the delicate balance two
strong women, Aurora and Emma
Greenway, preserve in their mother
daughter relationship; all the men in
their lives — husbands and lovers —
are weak and rather pathetic. (You
sense that McMurtry and Brooks
think there's something sexy about
ineffectual men.) Brooks really
takes his tone from the last 50 pages
of the novel, in which Emma learns
she has cancer, and audiences
respond to his movie because it
makes them weep. Debra Winger is
terrific as Emma — she's zesty in a

loose, improvisatory style — but
Shirley MacLaine, as Aurora, ap
pears somewhat hard and sharp and
unsympathetic: her timing is just
about perfect, but she doesn't show
a great deal of depth. The film has a
number of good sequences, and a
lovely cameo by John Lithgow, but
Brooks is not a director yet (Oscar
or no Oscar), and much of what he
does here is fairly shameless. With
Jeff Daniels as Emma's husband,
Flap.
Plays tonight with "Twice in a
Lifetime."
Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Director Hector Babenco's
adaptation of Manuel Puig's 1976
novel works on the audience in dis
appointingly obvious ways. Both
movie and book are set in a prison
cell in an unnamed South American
country, where Valentin (Raul
Julia), a Marxist revolutionary, is
beaten and questioned regularly by
the guards. He's cared for by his
cellmate Molina (William Hurt), a
homosexual imprisoned for corrupt
ing a minor, who attempts to enter
tain Valentin and himself with an
elaborate telling of a romantic 1940s
Nazi propaganda film. The novel is
about fantasy and escapism, and the
loving/manipulative relationship of
Molina and Valentin, but the movie
gives the material an artsy
sentimental gloss that flattens the
characters and the book's meanings.
Hurt is wonderful in his role, though
Molina's flighty romanticism is not
quite within his range. Leonard
Schrader wrote the screenplay.
Featuring Sonia Braga in a dual role
and Hereon Capri.
Plays this week with "The Trip to
Bountiful."
Out of Africa (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adapta
tion of Isak Dinesen's memoir suf
fers from an excess of tastefulness
and respect for its subject, and the
two stare — Meryl Streep as Dinesen
and Robert Redford as her lover,
Denys Finch Hatton — don't display
a single romantic impulse; they
never connect with each other (or
the audience) emotionally. The
movie begins as Dinesen marries the
Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke (a
marvelous Klaus Maria Brandauer)
— she seemingly for the title, he
expressly for the money — and to
gether they start a coffee plantation
in British East Africa in 1914. She
soon drops this adulterous playboy
husband and becomes involved with
hunter and , ide Finch Hatton.
Dinesen was a skilled enough writer
to engage one emotionally at the
same time she was turninc her expe

riences into an unabashed romantic
idyll. Pollack doesn't display a com
parable skill, and he adamantly
refuses to whip up any excitement or
tension. Streep gives another per
fectly polished, technically accom
plished performance that fails to
suggest any inner life to her charac
ter, but the film's biggest problems
lie with Redford. He has taken to
playing ideals, and here he is meant
to be the wild, unconquerable spirit
of Africa. In this film (as in "The
Natural") Redford floats above the
other actors, swathed in a gauzy aura
that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a
more energetic supporting perfor
mance.

Twice in a Lifetime (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This family drama about adultery
and divorce uses 1970s self-analysis
pedantry to justify 1950s (and
1980s) small-town family and com
munity cliches, making it a truly in
tolerable hybrid. Gene Hackman is
Harry, a Seattle steelworker who
abandons his family for a barmaid
(Ann-Margret), and the movie
presents his bailing out as the best
solution for everybody. Colin Wel
land's script also puts this family's
aggressively middle-class values on a
pedestal, so both Harry and we
aren't meant to question them, we're
meant to admire them. The movie
avoids all ugly emotions by cutting
away from the key confrontational
scenes, because otherwise we might
not buy its pop psycho-platitudes
about life, love and fulfillment. For a
great movie on the same theme, see
"Shoot the Moon." Directed by Bud
Yorkin, with Ellen Burstyn as the
drippy-devoted wife, Amy Madigan
as the upset daughter, Ally Sheedy
and Brian Dennehy.
Plays tonight with "Terms of En
dearment."

Yojimbo (1961)
Pagoda Theatre, San Francisco
The opening scene of Akira
Kurosawa's 21st movie is a tribute to
American Westerns ("High Noon"
in particular): Sanjuro (Toshiru
Mifune) stalks bravely up and down
the street of a small town while
everyone else hides. But Kurosawa
charges this scene, and indeed the
whole movie, with his own auda
cious blend of comedy and horror —
a dog trots indifferently through the
street carrying a human hand in its
mouth. This hilarious mock-Western
about a mercenary in mid- 19th cen
tury Japan who hires himself out to
the terrified men on both sides of a
civil war ("Yojimbo" means "the
bodyguard") influenced Sergio
Leone's spaghetti Westerns and pos
sibly Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" as well (both Kurosawa and
Penn mix comedy and violence and
arrive at surprising results). And in
turn it was influenced by John Ford
and Howard Hawks — though what
is most entertaining about
"Yojimbo" are the ways in which
Kurosawa reverses our Western-fed
expectations. Sanjuro is the only
man of courage on the screen; the
others are frightened, ineffectual in
sects. Appropriately, Toshiro
Mifune underplays skillfully while
all the other actors (Eijiro Tono,
Kamatari Fujiwata, Takashi
Shimura, Seizaburo Kawazu, Isuzu
Yamada) do wildly funny bur
lesques, their faces frozen in pain
and anger like gargoyles.

Midnight Express (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The tale of Billy Hayes, who was
put in a Turkish jail for attempting
to smuggle hash out of the country,
has been turned into a lurid piece of
audience manipulation by director

Alan Parker and screenwriter Oliver
Stone. Parker has no compunctions
about interpolating the sound of a
racing heartbeat into the soundtrack
to rev up the suspense, or employing
a glossy tabloid style for the prison
scenes. When it was released, this
shameful movie pretended to be a
plea for reform: A postscript
proclaimed that it had opened the
door for negotiations between the
United States and Turkey about the
release of American prisoners. You
got the idea that the purveyors of
this most crass slice of Hollywood
commercialism were actually buck
ing for a Nobel Peace Prize. With
Brad Davis as Billy, John Hurt,
Randy Quaid, Bo Hopkins, Mike
Kellin and Paul Smith.
Plays Wednesday through Friday
with "Kiss of the Spider Woman."
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish arisotocracy in pre-war Fer
rara; this movie, adapted by Giorgio
Bassani and Vittorio De Sica from
Bassani's semi-autobiographical
novel, shows us the last gasps of that
aristocracy, before Mussolini
snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid —
images whirl in your head years after
you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback
for De Sica, whose films after his
neo-realist masterpieces had been
disappointments. It was a triumph,
but his last; he was dead by 1974.
Dominique Sanda (whose beauty is
other-worldly) and Helmut Berger
play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays this Wednesday with "The
Tin Drum."
Jewel of the Nile (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
This sequel to "Romancing the
Stone" is a rather dry, redundant

reworking of the tricks in the
original. Joan Wilder and Jack Col
ton (Kathleen Turner and Michael
Douglas again) are on their world
cruise, and, as a fairytale couple,
they need a fairytale adventure to
give their relationship a boost. It
comes in the form of a sinisterly
charming prince (Spiros Focas). The
silly, clumsily staged reprise of the
original's opening sequence sets the
tone for the rest of the movie, and
Danny DeVito's one-note perfor
mance from "Romancing" is given
more play here. This is symptomatic
of producer and star Douglas' sense
of humor and creativity. Directed by
Lewis Teague and written by Mark
Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner,
who mostly discard the female sen
sibility of the original.

a great deal of depth. The film has a
number of good sequences, and a
lovely cameo by John Lithgow, but
Brooks is not a director yet (Oscar
or no Oscar), and much of what he
does here is fairly shameless. With
Jeff Daniels as Emma's husband,
Flap.
Plays tonight with "Twice in a
Lifetime."
Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Director Hector Babenco's
adaptation of Manuel Puig's 1976
novel works on the audience in dis
appointingly obvious ways. Both
movie and book are set in a prison
cell in an unnamed South American
country, where Valentin (Raul
Julia), a Marxist revolutionary, is
beaten and questioned regularly by
the guards. He's cared for by his
cellmate Molina (William Hurt), a
homosexual imprisoned for corrupt
ing a minor, who attempts to enter
tain Valentin and himself with an
elaborate telling of a romantic 1940s
Nazi propaganda film. The novel is
about fantasy and escapism, and the
loving/manipulative relationship of
Molina and Valentin, but the movie
gives the material an artsy
sentimental gloss that flattens the
characters and the book's meanings.
Hurt is wonderful in his role, though
Molina's flighty romanticism is not
quite within his range. Leonard
Schrader wrote the screenplay.
Featuring Sonia Braga in a dual role
and Hereon Capri.
Plays this week with "The Trip to
Bountiful."
Out of Africa (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adapta
tion of Isak Dinesen's memoir suf
fers from an excess of tastefulness
and respect for its subject, and the
two stare — Meryl Streep as Dinesen
and Robert Redford as her lover,
Denys Finch Hatton — don't display
a single romantic impulse; they
never connect with each other (or
the audience) emotionally. The
movie begins as Dinesen marries the
Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke (a
marvelous Klaus Maria Brandauer)
— she seemingly for the title, he
expressly for the money — and to
gether they start a coffee plantation
in British East Africa in 1914. She
soon drops this adulterous playboy
husband and becomes involved with
hunter and , ide Finch Hatton.
Dinesen was a skilled enough writer
to engage one emotionally at the
same time she was turninc her expe

riences into an unabashed romantic
idyll. Pollack doesn't display a com
parable skill, and he adamantly
refuses to whip up any excitement or
tension. Streep gives another per
fectly polished, technically accom
plished performance that fails to
suggest any inner life to her charac
ter, but the film's biggest problems
lie with Redford. He has taken to
playing ideals, and here he is meant
to be the wild, unconquerable spirit
of Africa. In this film (as in "The
Natural") Redford floats above the
other actors, swathed in a gauzy aura
that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a
more energetic supporting perfor
mance.

Twice in a Lifetime (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This family drama about adultery
and divorce uses 1970s self-analysis
pedantry to justify 1950s (and
1980s) small-town family and com
munity cliches, making it a truly in
tolerable hybrid. Gene Hackman is
Harry, a Seattle steelworker who
abandons his family for a barmaid
(Ann-Margret), and the movie
presents his bailing out as the best
solution for everybody. Colin Wel
land's script also puts this family's
aggressively middle-class values on a
pedestal, so both Harry and we
aren't meant to question them, we're
meant to admire them. The movie
avoids all ugly emotions by cutting
away from the key confrontational
scenes, because otherwise we might
not buy its pop psycho-platitudes
about life, love and fulfillment. For a
great movie on the same theme, see
"Shoot the Moon." Directed by Bud
Yorkin, with Ellen Burstyn as the
drippy-devoted wife, Amy Madigan
as the upset daughter, Ally Sheedy
and Brian Dennehy.
Plays tonight with "Terms of En
dearment."

Yojimbo (1961)
Pagoda Theatre, San Francisco
The opening scene of Akira
Kurosawa's 21st movie is a tribute to
American Westerns ("High Noon"
in particular): Sanjuro (Toshiru
Mifune) stalks bravely up and down
the street of a small town while
everyone else hides. But Kurosawa
charges this scene, and indeed the
whole movie, with his own auda
cious blend of comedy and horror —
a dog trots indifferently through the
street carrying a human hand in its
mouth. This hilarious mock-Western
about a mercenary in mid- 19th cen
tury Japan who hires himself out to
the terrified men on both sides of a
civil war ("Yojimbo" means "the
bodyguard") influenced Sergio
Leone's spaghetti Westerns and pos
sibly Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" as well (both Kurosawa and
Penn mix comedy and violence and
arrive at surprising results). And in
turn it was influenced by John Ford
and Howard Hawks — though what
is most entertaining about
"Yojimbo" are the ways in which
Kurosawa reverses our Western-fed
expectations. Sanjuro is the only
man of courage on the screen; the
others are frightened, ineffectual in
sects. Appropriately, Toshiro
Mifune underplays skillfully while
all the other actors (Eijiro Tono,
Kamatari Fujiwata, Takashi
Shimura, Seizaburo Kawazu, Isuzu
Yamada) do wildly funny bur
lesques, their faces frozen in pain
and anger like gargoyles.
Photographed by Kazuo Miyagawa;
music by Masaru Sato.
Plays Tuesday with "The Bad
Sleep Well."
Midnight Express (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The tale of Billy Hayes, who was
put in a Turkish jail for attempting
to smuggle hash out of the country,
has been turned into a lurid piece of
audience manipulation by director

Alan Parker and screenwriter Oliver
Stone. Parker has no compunctions
about interpolating the sound of a
racing heartbeat into the soundtrack
to rev up the suspense, or employing
a glossy tabloid style for the prison
scenes. When it was released, this
shameful movie pretended to be a
plea for reform: A postscript
proclaimed that it had opened the
door for negotiations between the
United States and Turkey about the
release of American prisoners. You
got the idea that the purveyors of
this most crass slice of Hollywood
commercialism were actually buck
ing for a Nobel Peace Prize. With
Brad Davis as Billy, John Hurt,
Randy Quaid, Bo Hopkins, Mike
Kellin and Paul Smith.
Plays Wednesday through Friday
with "Kiss of the Spider Woman."
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish arisotocracy in pre-war Fer
rara; this movie, adapted by Giorgio
Bassani and Vittorio De Sica from
Bassani's semi-autobiographical
novel, shows us the last gasps of that
aristocracy, before Mussolini
snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid —
images whirl in your head years after
you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback
for De Sica, whose films after his
neo-realist masterpieces had been
disappointments. It was a triumph,
but his last; he was dead by 1974.
Dominique Sanda (whose beauty is
other-worldly) and Helmut Berger
play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays this Wednesday with "The
Tin Drum."
Jewel of the Nile (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
This sequel to "Romancing the
Stone" is a rather dry, redundant

reworking of the tricks in the
original. Joan Wilder and Jack Col
ton (Kathleen Turner and Michael
Douglas again) are on their world
cruise, and, as a fairytale couple,
they need a fairytale adventure to
give their relationship a boost. It
comes in the form of a sinisterly
charming prince (Spiros Focas). The
silly, clumsily staged reprise of the
original's opening sequence sets the
tone for the rest of the movie, and
Danny DeVito's one-note perfor
mance from "Romancing" is given
more play here. This is symptomatic
of producer and star Douglas' sense
of humor and creativity. Directed by
Lewis Teague and written by Mark
Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner,
who mostly discard the female sen
sibility of the original.
Plays Sunday.
Young Sherlock Holmes (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Barry Levinson
("Diner") tries to be Steven Speil
berg in this tired piece of adventure
juvenilia; it's a bizarre misapplica
tion of Levinson's considerable tal
ents. The movie was written by Chris
Columbus ("Gremlins,"
"Goonies"), who blatantly steals the
evil religious cult plot from "Indiana
Jones" and mines parts of his earlier
scripts as well. (It's far, far too early
in his career for Columbus to be
repeating himself — we may think
he has nothing but kiddy adventures
in his head.) Fortunately, the
filmmakers found some appealing
young performers for the lead roles:
Nicholas Rowe plays a tall, some
what frail-looking, intensely intel
lectual Holmes; Alan Cox uncannily
perfect as the befuddled Watson;
Sophie Ward is the likeable heroine
(she looks like a young Amy Irving,
and, amusingly, Rowe looks like a
young, lanky Speilberg). Levinson
can't do much with the action
scenes, but there's some nicely
realized period detail and a couple
of quite effective hallucinatory hor
rors.
Plays Sunday with "101 Dalma
tions."
The Deer Hunter (1978)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Michael Cimino's astonishingly
powerful (and extremely contover
sial) movie about the effects of a
Vietnamese POW camp on three
buddies from a Pennsylvania steel
town gives off both left-wing and
right-wing vibrations. Politically it's
a mess, and it is fueled by a particu
larly inscrutable brand of machismo,
but Cimino and Deric Washburn
(who collaborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt to
grapple with the Vietnam experi
ence. The film flounders out of an
understandable inability to assim

ilate a far too recent nightmare; it
isn't a hard sell (as many outraged
critics have claimed). As the sur
vivor, Michael, Robert De Niro
gives a supremely intelligent reading
of a tough, closed-off role, but the
most memorable performances are
by Christopher Walken as his best
friend and Meryl Streep as the
woman they share. With John
Savage and the late John Cazale.
Vilmos Zsigmond's meticulous
cinematography helps to keep you
interested through the overlong
opening stateside section.
Plays tommorow with "Coming
Home."
The Trip to Bountiful (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Watching this Peter Masterson
film of a Horton Foote 1953 teleplay
is like experiencing sensory depriva
tion. Since nothing surprising or dra
matic ever happens, the movie has a
drawn-out quality, yet people might
feel comfortable with it precisely be
cause, like TV, it doesn't demand
one's full attention. The story is
about grandmotherly Carrie Watts,
who journeys to her hometown of
Bountiful, Texas, where she hopes
to recapture a more pleasant and
prosperous past. Geraldine Page's
Oscar for her performance here Is a
dubious distinction; she scores
points for acting sly and cute, but her
role is not, to put it kindly, one
which an actor can grow in. Foote's
material is not just repetitive, it's old
hat from the beginning; it's grand
mother schtick. The pace is torpid,
and Masterson's directing style is so
static and enervating that the editing
glitches — cutting away from or to a
character too soon — stick out a
mile. With John Heard, Carlin
Glynn and Richard Bradford.
Plays this week with "Kiss of the
Spider Woman."
Terms of Endearment (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jack Nicholson dominates this
James Brooks movie by playing
against his role as Garrett
Breedlove, a slightly seedy
astronaut. The movie, which began
life as an oddball 1975 novel by
Larry McMurty, is essentially a story
about the delicate balance two
strong women, Aurora and Emma
Greenway, preserve in their mother
daughter relationship; all the men in
their lives — husbands and lovers —
are weak and rather pathetic. (You
sense that McMurtry and Brooks
think there's something sexy about
ineffectual men.) Brooks really
takes his tone from the last 50 pages
of the novel, in which Emma learns
she has cancer, and audiences
respond to his movie because it
makes them weep. Debra Winger is
terrific as Emma — she's zesty in a

loose, improvisatory style — but
Shirley MacLaine, as Aurora, ap
pears somewhat hard and sharp and
unsympathetic: her timing is just
about perfect, but she doesn't show
a great deal of depth. The film has a
number of good sequences, and a
lovely cameo by John Lithgow, but
Brooks is not a director yet (Oscar
or no Oscar), and much of what he

American Westerns ("High Noon"
in particular): Sanjuro (Toshiru
Mifune) stalks bravely up and down
the street of a small town while
everyone else hides. But Kurosawa
charges this scene, and indeed the
whole movie, with his own auda
cious blend of comedy and horror —
a dog trots indifferently through the
street carrying a human hand in its
mouth. This hilarious mock-Western
about a mercenary in mid- 19th cen
tury Japan who hires himself out to
the terrified men on both sides of a
civil war ("Yojimbo" means "the
bodyguard") influenced Sergio
Leone's spaghetti Westerns and pos
sibly Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" as well (both Kurosawa and
Penn mix comedy and violence and
arrive at surprising results). And in
turn it was influenced by John Ford
and Howard Hawks — though what
is most entertaining about
"Yojimbo" are the ways in which
Kurosawa reverses our Western-fed
expectations. Sanjuro is the only
man of courage on the screen; the
others are frightened, ineffectual in
sects. Appropriately, Toshiro
Mifune underplays skillfully while
all the other actors (Eijiro Tono,
Kamatari Fujiwata, Takashi
Shimura, Seizaburo Kawazu, Isuzu
Yamada) do wildly funny bur
lesques, their faces frozen in pain
and anger like gargoyles.

Midnight Express (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The tale of Billy Hayes, who was
put in a Turkish jail for attempting
to smuggle hash out of the country,
has been turned into a lurid piece of
audience manipulation by director

Alan Parker and screenwriter Oliver
Stone. Parker has no compunctions
about interpolating the sound of a
racing heartbeat into the soundtrack
to rev up the suspense, or employing
a glossy tabloid style for the prison
scenes. When it was released, this
shameful movie pretended to be a
plea for reform: A postscript
proclaimed that it had opened the
door for negotiations between the
United States and Turkey about the
release of American prisoners. You
got the idea that the purveyors of
this most crass slice of Hollywood
commercialism were actually buck
ing for a Nobel Peace Prize. With
Brad Davis as Billy, John Hurt,
Randy Quaid, Bo Hopkins, Mike
Kellin and Paul Smith.
Plays Wednesday through Friday
with "Kiss of the Spider Woman."
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish arisotocracy in pre-war Fer
rara; this movie, adapted by Giorgio
Bassani and Vittorio De Sica from
Bassani's semi-autobiographical
novel, shows us the last gasps of that
aristocracy, before Mussolini
snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid —
images whirl in your head years after
you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback
for De Sica, whose films after his
neo-realist masterpieces had been
disappointments. It was a triumph,
but his last; he was dead by 1974.
Dominique Sanda (whose beauty is
other-worldly) and Helmut Berger
play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays this Wednesday with "The
Tin Drum."
Jewel of the Nile (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
This sequel to "Romancing the
Stone" is a rather dry, redundant

reworking of the tricks in the
original. Joan Wilder and Jack Col
ton (Kathleen Turner and Michael
Douglas again) are on their world
cruise, and, as a fairytale couple,
they need a fairytale adventure to
give their relationship a boost. It
comes in the form of a sinisterly
charming prince (Spiros Focas). The
silly, clumsily staged reprise of the
original's opening sequence sets the
tone for the rest of the movie, and
Danny DeVito's one-note perfor
mance from "Romancing" is given
more play here. This is symptomatic
of producer and star Douglas' sense
of humor and creativity. Directed by
Lewis Teague and written by Mark
Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner,
who mostly discard the female sen
sibility of the original.
Plays Sunday.
Young Sherlock Holmes (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Barry Levinson
("Diner") tries to be Steven Speil
berg in this tired piece of adventure
juvenilia; it's a bizarre misapplica
tion of Levinson's considerable tal
ents. The movie was written by Chris
Columbus ("Gremlins,"
"Goonies"), who blatantly steals the
evil religious cult plot from "Indiana
Jones" and mines parts of his earlier
scripts as well. (It's far, far too early
in his career for Columbus to be
repeating himself — we may think
he has nothing but kiddy adventures
in his head.) Fortunately, the
filmmakers found some appealing
young performers for the lead roles:
Nicholas Rowe plays a tall, some
what frail-looking, intensely intel
lectual Holmes; Alan Cox uncannily
perfect as the befuddled Watson;
Sophie Ward is the likeable heroine
(she looks like a young Amy Irving,
and, amusingly, Rowe looks like a
young, lanky Speilberg). Levinson
can't do much with the action
scenes, but there's some nicely
realized period detail and a couple
of quite effective hallucinatory hor
rors.
Plays Sunday with "101 Dalma
tions."
The Deer Hunter (1978)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Michael Cimino's astonishingly
powerful (and extremely contover
sial) movie about the effects of a
Vietnamese POW camp on three
buddies from a Pennsylvania steel
town gives off both left-wing and
right-wing vibrations. Politically it's
a mess, and it is fueled by a particu
larly inscrutable brand of machismo,
but Cimino and Deric Washburn
(who collaborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt to
grapple with the Vietnam experi
ence. The film flounders out of an
understandable inability to assim

ilate a far too recent nightmare; it
isn't a hard sell (as many outraged
critics have claimed). As the sur
vivor, Michael, Robert De Niro
gives a supremely intelligent reading
of a tough, closed-off role, but the
most memorable performances are
by Christopher Walken as his best
friend and Meryl Streep as the
woman they share. With John
Savage and the late John Cazale.
Vilmos Zsigmond's meticulous
cinematography helps to keep you
interested through the overlong
opening stateside section.
Plays tommorow with "Coming
Home."
The Trip to Bountiful (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Watching this Peter Masterson
film of a Horton Foote 1953 teleplay
is like experiencing sensory depriva
tion. Since nothing surprising or dra
matic ever happens, the movie has a
drawn-out quality, yet people might
feel comfortable with it precisely be
cause, like TV, it doesn't demand
one's full attention. The story is
about grandmotherly Carrie Watts,
who journeys to her hometown of
Bountiful, Texas, where she hopes
to recapture a more pleasant and
prosperous past. Geraldine Page's
Oscar for her performance here Is a
dubious distinction; she scores
points for acting sly and cute, but her
role is not, to put it kindly, one
which an actor can grow in. Foote's
material is not just repetitive, it's old
hat from the beginning; it's grand
mother schtick. The pace is torpid,
and Masterson's directing style is so
static and enervating that the editing
glitches — cutting away from or to a
character too soon — stick out a
mile. With John Heard, Carlin
Glynn and Richard Bradford.
Plays this week with "Kiss of the
Spider Woman."
Terms of Endearment (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jack Nicholson dominates this
James Brooks movie by playing
against his role as Garrett
Breedlove, a slightly seedy
astronaut. The movie, which began
life as an oddball 1975 novel by
Larry McMurty, is essentially a story
about the delicate balance two
strong women, Aurora and Emma
Greenway, preserve in their mother
daughter relationship; all the men in
their lives — husbands and lovers —
are weak and rather pathetic. (You
sense that McMurtry and Brooks
think there's something sexy about
ineffectual men.) Brooks really
takes his tone from the last 50 pages
of the novel, in which Emma learns
she has cancer, and audiences
respond to his movie because it
makes them weep. Debra Winger is
terrific as Emma — she's zesty in a

loose, improvisatory style — but
Shirley MacLaine, as Aurora, ap
pears somewhat hard and sharp and
unsympathetic: her timing is just
about perfect, but she doesn't show
a great deal of depth. The film has a
number of good sequences, and a
lovely cameo by John Lithgow, but
Brooks is not a director yet (Oscar
or no Oscar), and much of what he
does here is fairly shameless. With
Jeff Daniels as Emma's husband,
Flap.

Lifetime."
Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Director Hector Babenco's
adaptation of Manuel Puig's 1976
novel works on the audience in dis
appointingly obvious ways. Both
movie and book are set in a prison
cell in an unnamed South American
country, where Valentin (Raul
Julia), a Marxist revolutionary, is
beaten and questioned regularly by
the guards. He's cared for by his
cellmate Molina (William Hurt), a
homosexual imprisoned for corrupt
ing a minor, who attempts to enter
tain Valentin and himself with an
elaborate telling of a romantic 1940s
Nazi propaganda film. The novel is
about fantasy and escapism, and the
loving/manipulative relationship of
Molina and Valentin, but the movie
gives the material an artsy
sentimental gloss that flattens the
characters and the book's meanings.
Hurt is wonderful in his role, though
Molina's flighty romanticism is not
quite within his range. Leonard
Schrader wrote the screenplay.
Featuring Sonia Braga in a dual role
and Hereon Capri.
Plays this week with "The Trip to
Bountiful."
Out of Africa (1985)
Century 10, Mountain View
Director Sidney Pollack and
screenwriter Kurt Luedtke's adapta
tion of Isak Dinesen's memoir suf
fers from an excess of tastefulness
and respect for its subject, and the
two stare — Meryl Streep as Dinesen
and Robert Redford as her lover,
Denys Finch Hatton — don't display
a single romantic impulse; they
never connect with each other (or
the audience) emotionally. The
movie begins as Dinesen marries the
Baron Bror von Blixen-Finecke (a
marvelous Klaus Maria Brandauer)
— she seemingly for the title, he
expressly for the money — and to
gether they start a coffee plantation
in British East Africa in 1914. She
soon drops this adulterous playboy
husband and becomes involved with
hunter and , ide Finch Hatton.
Dinesen was a skilled enough writer
to engage one emotionally at the
same time she was turninc her expe

riences into an unabashed romantic
idyll. Pollack doesn't display a com
parable skill, and he adamantly
refuses to whip up any excitement or
tension. Streep gives another per
fectly polished, technically accom
plished performance that fails to
suggest any inner life to her charac
ter, but the film's biggest problems
lie with Redford. He has taken to
playing ideals, and here he is meant
to be the wild, unconquerable spirit
of Africa. In this film (as in "The
Natural") Redford floats above the
other actors, swathed in a gauzy aura
that lets no human emotions
through. With Michael Kitchen in a
more energetic supporting perfor
mance.

Twice in a Lifetime (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This family drama about adultery
and divorce uses 1970s self-analysis
pedantry to justify 1950s (and
1980s) small-town family and com
munity cliches, making it a truly in
tolerable hybrid. Gene Hackman is
Harry, a Seattle steelworker who
abandons his family for a barmaid
(Ann-Margret), and the movie
presents his bailing out as the best
solution for everybody. Colin Wel
land's script also puts this family's
aggressively middle-class values on a
pedestal, so both Harry and we
aren't meant to question them, we're
meant to admire them. The movie
avoids all ugly emotions by cutting
away from the key confrontational
scenes, because otherwise we might
not buy its pop psycho-platitudes
about life, love and fulfillment. For a
great movie on the same theme, see
"Shoot the Moon." Directed by Bud
Yorkin, with Ellen Burstyn as the
drippy-devoted wife, Amy Madigan
as the upset daughter, Ally Sheedy
and Brian Dennehy.
Plays tonight with "Terms of En
dearment."
