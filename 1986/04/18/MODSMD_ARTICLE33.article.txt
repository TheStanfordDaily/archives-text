## Stanford prepares for weekend with win Top-ranked Trojans set to invade Farm 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In sports, you have your friendly
rivalries and your intense rivalries.
The Stanford-USC women's tennis
rivalry is most definitely the latter.
Example No. I: During the waning
moments of yesterday's home match
between the Cardinal and U.S. Inter
national University, Linda Gates, a
Stanford senior last season, stepped
up to the court microphone.
Gates, a veteran of Stanford-USC
battles, reminded the few spectators
on hand to show up for tomorrow's
noontime match with the "dirty
Trojans."

Example No. 2: As top-ranked
USC was handing the No. 2 Cardinal
its only defeat of the season April 4 in
Los Angeles, Trojan Dana Levy
decided to make the most of the sit
uation.
As she and teammate Caroline
Kuhlman edged closer to winning
their doubles match and clinching the
6-3 team victory, Levy celebrated
each point in a grandiose fashion that
would have made Jimmy Connors
proud. Since then. Cardinal players
have pinned her with the not-so
affectionate nickname "Dino".
Example No. 3: The past four
seasons, Stanford and USC have
traded turns winning the NCAA
championship.
That's enough to create a rivalry
between any two teams. The Card
inal's only dual-match losses during
that period have come against the
Trojans, two in Los Angeles and one
on the Farm. This season, USC is 17-
1. Stanford is 15-1.
Simply put, tomorrow's match
should be nothing short of excellent.
"It's definitely the biggest rivalry in
our region," Stanford junior Patty

Fendick said yesterday.
"Playing 'SC here is obviously the
biggest dual match," sophomore Kay
Tittle said. "The intensity of the
rivalry makes it the most fun."
Fendick and Tittle will be two of
the key players to watch tomorrow
Fendick, 9-4 playing at No. 1 singles
this season, will encounter her biggest
challenge of the year in Kuhlman.
The Trojan sophomore is the nation's
No. 1 singles player, having compiled
a 25-0 record this season.
Kuhlman knocked off Fendick 7-6,
6-4 in the teams' previous match, but
Fendick has lifted the level of her
game since then. "I'm playing a lot
better," she said. "We'll at least be
starting on even ground this time."
Brennan listed Fendick's chances
as "very good. She's home. She's
playing well. I think the timing's per
fect."
Tittle sat out yesterday's match
with knee and arm ailments, but she
said that she will be ready tomorrow.
"I think I'll be fine," she said. "I've
taken a few days off and the workouts
have been lighter.
"I've done something to my left
forearm," added Tittle, who has led
the Cardinal this season with a 13-1
record at No. 5 singles. "I don't know
if it's tendonitis\or a stress fracture.
Right now it's something I can play
with."
Tittle indicated that tomorrow's
outcome will be decided in the three
set matches. "Last time, there were
several three-set matches," she said.
"It's just a matter of who wins those
matches. It's going to be real close."
"I think we can win," Brennan
added, noting the psychological im
portance of the match. "Obviously, if
we lose to USC twice, we might be a
little psyched out."
Brennan and his players urged stu
dents to attend the match. "They
(USC) get a lot of people to watch the
match there," he said. "It would be a
shame if we didn't here. There's a lot
riding on it."
"We've always had real good
crowds for USC," Fendick added.
"It's always close and always excit
ing."
Admission is free for those with
Stanford student ID cards. General
admission tickets will be on sale at the
match for $2.

Patty Fendick will have her hands full this weekend when she meets No. 1 ranked and undefeated Caroline
Kuhlman of USC. The Stanford junior has been playing well of late, though, and said, "The last two matches
have been my best."
