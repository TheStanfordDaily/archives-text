### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The way that the Stanford women's
tennis teams has been destroying its
opponents recently, you'd think that
the No. 2 Cardinal has been schedul
ing a bunch of patsies.
To the contrary, said Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan. "We've
played good teams. We've just beaten
them," he said yesterday, following
Stanford's 9-0 romp over No. 12 U.S.
International University at the Var
sity Tennis Courts.
USIU figured to be a challenge for
the Cardinal, which wits playing with
out freshman Eleni Rossides and
sophomore Kay Tittle in singles. But
Stanford played possibly its best ten
nis of the season and annihilated the
Gulls, who were not able to take a set
from the Cardinal.
"I think we played very, very well,"
Brennan said. "This (USIU) is a
pretty good team."
The Gulls were playing on the
Stanford tennis courts for the first
time and were slightly intimidated.
"It's always a good sign when the op
posing players walk into the stadium,
look at the board with all of the
championship years listed on it, and
take out their cameras to take
pictures," Brennan said.
"They (USIU) didn't look very
sharp," he added.
One player who did look sharp was
Cardinal junior Patty Fendick.
Playing at No. 1 singles, she used an
assortment of shots to dismantle
USIU's Sylvie Tetreault 6-0, 6-2.
"The last two matches have been
my best," Fendick said. "I'm hitting a
lot harder."
Fendick's doubles partner, junior
Leigh Anne Eldredge, upped her
dual match record to 11-2 and gave
Stanford a 2-0 lead with a 6-1, 6-2
victory over the Gulls' Elizma Nortje
in the No. 3 singles slot.
The No. 2 singles match featured a
tremendous contrast in styles. Card
inal freshman Marianne Werdel,
loaded with powerful groundstrokes,
was too much for USIU's Kefi
