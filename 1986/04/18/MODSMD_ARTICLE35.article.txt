### BRANDI WATSON Staff Writer 
Take Highway 101 north to
Ralston, then turn right and there
you are at the Redwood City
Boathouse, site of one of the
premier collegiate crew regattas of
the year — the Redwood Shores
Stanford Rowing Classic.
The Stanford men's and
women's crew teams will host five
of the top rowing schools in the
country this weekend on the Card
inal home course. The field in
cludes teams from Brown, Wis
consin, UCLA, California and
Washington. All teams are flown
out at the expense of the sponsor.
Redwood Shores.
"This is a really good opportu
nity to see excellent racing," Stan

ford Women's Coach John Davis
said. "There are big match-ups for
both the women and the men."
The women's events will feature
previously No. 1 Washington and
current No. 1 Wisconsin, who beat
the Huskies two weeks ago in San
Diego to snatch the top ranking.
"Wisconsin is remarkable," Davis
said.
The Cardinal women's team is
hoping to keep close company
with these two teams, however.
Coming off a narrow loss to both
of them in San Diego, the Cardinal
has worked hard for this reunion.
"We keep getting better and
better," Davis said. "But it really
depends on how much we improve
and how much they improve. We
have to concentrate on what we're
doing. We don't have to row over our
heads and do what they can do."
Stanford may even find its position
an asset. "This is a tremendous posi
tion to be in," Davis said. "It's nice to
be an underdog, especially an under
dog with a good shot."
This regatta will feature head-to
head competition between two teams
in a round-robin style.
Tough races may better charac
terize the men's events. "We are fully
realizing how good all the crews we're
racing are," Stanford Men's Coach
Ken Dreyfuss said. "Every team in
the regatta is going to be tough."
The Stanford men are also a force
to be reckoned with. "We have the
strongest and best prepared varsity
crew since I've been at Stanford,"
Dreyfuss said.
Races are scheduled to begin at 9
a.m. tomorrow and Sunday. Accord
ing to Dreyfuss, "The way this season
is unfolding, this should be an excit
ing, high-level regatta."
