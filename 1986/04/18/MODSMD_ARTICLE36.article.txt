# Netters look to southern challenge
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
It's tempting to compare this weekend's matches
to great final battles, last hurrah's, apocalyptic
duels, etc. After all, this is the last time in the dis
tinguished careers of four Stanford seniors that the
Cardinal will travel to Los Angeles to face long
time nemeses UCLA and USC.
Will it be another Little Big Horn, where the
Cardinal is annihilated on foreign territory by the
Bruins and Trojans? Will it be the Alamo, where
the Cardinal puts up a long and brave fight to come
up just short? Or will it be another Iwo Jima, where
Stanford conquers a foreign land and raises the
Cardinal flag in victory?
A sentimental factor is present also. After all,
when Stanford seniors Dan Goldie, Jim Grabb,
John Letts and Eric Rosenfeld were freshmen they
drove the Cardinal to a sweep of UCLA and USC
in L.A. and ended the season with the NCAA
Championship trophy in their hands.
So, the Cardinal should probably be a little
choked up about this final road trip, right? Nope.
The players have more important things on their
minds. "Yeah. I'm looking forward to it,"
Rosenfeld said. "But (the last southern road trip)

isn't that big a deal. These players aren't going to
disappear."
Stanford is on a bit of a roll, and that's what
Rosenfeld is thinking about.
"Everyone is playing well in my eyes right now,
and the whole team seems really hungry to me," he
said. "With each day we're getting more into it and
more eager so I'm curious to see how we'll do this
weekend."
When asked if he'd especially like to see the
seniors win this weekend, Stanford Coach Dick
Gould played down any exceptional stress on the
matches.
"I'd like to win any time," he said. "The impor
tant thing is that we continue playing well and keep
our competitive edge."
The competition will definitely be keen, as the
matches will feature three of the top six teams in
the country, No. 2 UCLA, No. 4 USC and No. 6
Stanford. Furthermore, seven of the top 30 players
in the nation will battle on the singles courts.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, Grabb is very
doubtful for this weekend's matches. The senior
has been suffering from a chronically pulled groin
this season, which he reaggravated in last Friday's
match against Arizona.
Stanford will first face the Trojans at 1 p.m.
today. Two weeks ago, the Cardinal defeated

USC at Stanford by a 5-4 score. That victory began
a five game win streak by the Cardinal squad.
Since that match, USC has dropped from third to
fourth in the rankings, and lost to UCLA last week
by a 5-4 score for the second time this year.
Trojan freshman Luke Jensen, however, has
moved up in the rankings from 12th to sixth. If
Grabb doesn't play, Jensen will probably face
Cardinal sophomore Patrick McEnroe. Jensen and
McEnroe were doubles partners in junior competi
tion.
USC will feature another weapon in senior Rick
Leach who has maintained his No. 1 ranking in the
nation.
In tomorrow's noontime match at UCLA, Stan
ford may be out for some revenge. Last year the
Bruins routed the Cardinal by an 8-1 score.
"Since we got smoked last year I think we've got
something to prove," McEnroe said.
The Cardinal will have to prove it against several
nationally ranked players, and in an Olympic size
tennis stadium. Bruin sophomore Brad Pearce has
moved into the No. 2 spot in the nation in the latest
rankings. He is followed by teammates Michael
Kures at No. 27 and Tim Trigueiro at No. 29.
In the rankings released Wednesday, Goldie
dropped to No. 10, while McEnroe moved from
44th to No. 17.
