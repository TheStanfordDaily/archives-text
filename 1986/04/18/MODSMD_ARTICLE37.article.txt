# Batsmen put lead on line

### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Crunch Time. That's what Billy
Packer calls those last few, deciding
moments of a basketball game, when
it's all on the line. It's something like
football's gut check.
But baseball, a sport long known
for its outlandish metaphors, can't
boast a comparable term. If one were
ever needed, it would be now — the
Cardinal's Crunch Time has come.
Stanford, which begins the
weekend in a first-place tie with
UCLA atop the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's Southern Division, will play
five league games in the space of the
next four days.
The games should go a long way
toward sorting out the mess at the top
of the league's standings.
Arizona State, 3- x /i games behind
the leaders with an 8-9 Six-Pac mark,
comes to Sunken Diamond for a
three-game set starting this afternoon
at 2:30. The teams will play 1 p.m.
games tomorrow and Sunday.
Then, UCLA comes to town for a
doubleheader on Monday.

"It's so early," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "Right now.
four teams have a shot at (the Pacific
10 Conference's Southern Division
championship). But things could
change in a real hurry ... one bad
weekend and . . . who knows?"

Six-Pac standings
1. Stanford 11-5
UCLA 11-5
3. Arizona 10-8
4. Arizona St. 8-9
5. USC 8-12
6. California 6-15

And, well, it could be all over.
After this weekend, the Cardinal will
have completed a big chunk of its Six-
Pac campaign: only three series, or
nine league games, will remain in its
30-game Six-Pac schedule.
Marquess said that he's going to
approach one game at a time, that he
"won't save anybody for UCLA."
With that kind of thinking, though,
his pitching staff could be depleted in
a hurry. Jack McDowell. 9-2 with
2.14 ERA, is listed as today's starter

against ASU's Royal Clayton, 3-2
and 4.83. Lee Plemel, 3-1, will face
Rick Dempster, who beat Stanford in
Tempe. tomorrow. Marquess will
choose between Kevin Kunkel and
Rob Wassenaar for Sunday's series
finale.
That leaves few hurlers to go
against UCLA Monday. Steve
Chitren, out of the rotation since
slumping at midseason, has been
mentioned.
"We'll see just what we have left
for UCLA," Marquess said.
Marquess said that ASU. winners
of two of three from Arizona last
weekend, has regrouped since the
teams' encounter earlier this month.
"They're playing well now, probably
as well as they've played all year."
Center fielder Rick Morris leads
ASU in almost every important of
fensive category. His .402 batting
average. 14 home runs, 16 doubles
and 53 RBI are team bests.
Though Morris' act is a tough one
to follow, other Sun Devils also come
to Sunken Diamond with big num

Ruben Amaro gets a kick out of running the bases. The third baseman and leadoff hitter is 1 l-for-12 in stolen
base attempts and has yet to be thrown out in Six-Pac play as he has nabbed seven steals.
bers. Designated hitter Ted Dyson
boasts a .371 batting average, nine
home runs and 42 RBI: first baseman
Roger Smith has hit seven home runs
to go with a .308 batting average.
"They're (ASU) a very well
balanced team," Marquess said.
"They hit the ball well, they have
good power ... a solid team."
As for his team. Marquess plans to
stick with the formula that produced
last weekend's three-game sweep of
California.
That means Toi Cook — whom
Marquess called "probably our hot
test hitter" — will hit in the cleanup
spot, freshman Ron Witmeyer will
play first and Ed Sprague, another
frosh, will be the DH.
