# Spikers meet USC
## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
USC is 19-0 in the California
Intercollegiate Volleyball Associ
ation and No. I in the nation. The
Stanford men's volleyball team is
the only squad left with a chance
to beat the Trojans in tomorrow
night's season finale at 7:30 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal is 12-7 in league
play, holding on to fifth place in
the conference which guarantees
the team a playoff spot if Penn
State wins the East Regional. If
the Nittany Lions, hosts of this
year's Final Four, fail to win their
regional, then they will probably
be given the at-large spot that
usually goes to the winner of the
West Regional.
In that case, the regional will be
held between the top four CIV A
teams and Stanford will be
knocked out of post-season play.
The squad will know its fate by
Monday, as the Eastern playoffs
start tomorrow.
Since the Cardinal is assured of
finishing in fifth, the crucial match
this weekend is really Penn State,
not USC. However, tomorrow
night's game against the Trojans is
important for other reasons.
Tomorrow night will be the final
home match for four graduating
seniors: Chris Braun, Brett
Monello, Dan Parr and Jon Root.
The team would also love to knock

off the top team in the nation
before a home crowd.
"This is the last home game of
the year for the seniors,'* Root
said, "and we're the only team left
that can beat SC. Everyone really
wants to win this one. The crowd
will be a big factor. We hope to get
a lot of support since this is out
last match, and we've made the
playoffs for the second year in a
row."
"Stanford is in pretty good
shape," Stanford Co-Coach Don
Shaw said. "We're fired up to play
these guys. USC is shooting for a
perfect season; we'll try to deny
them and prove that we deserve a
playoff spot. I think we have a
good chance."
USC defeated Stanford in three
games the first time the two met
this season. The Trojans are led by
senior setter Rudy Dvorak,
brotjier of Olympic setter Dusty
Dvorak and former Stanford set
ter Diedre Dvorak.
"He's probably the best in the
conference," Shaw said, "and pos
sibly the best in the country. He
runs their offense very well."
Junior Adam Johnson tops USC
with 483 kills and also has a .343
hitting percentage. Dave Yoder,
brother of USC Coach Bob
Yoder, is second with 372, and
freshman Tom Duke has 337 kills
and leads the squad with a .427
average.
