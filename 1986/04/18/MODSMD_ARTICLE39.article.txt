# Track competes in different meets
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
For the Stanford track team, it's
that time of the season to wait for
what's to come and try to get ready
for it.
With the big meets still a few weeks
away and the preseason over, Stan
ford Coach Brooks Johnson is
patiently biding his time, saving his
athletes for a later date.
"We're woodshedding for Cal, get
ting people healthy," he said. "It's
time for a lot of rest or a lot of work,
whichever they need.'"
The California meet is on May 3,
and for the next two weeks, the Card
inal athletes will be competing
primarily as individuals. Johnson will
be sending his athletes to various

meets around the country in which
they'll have a chance to face strong
competition and possibly qualify for
the NCAAs.
This weekend the Cardinal will be
just down the road, competing in the
Bruce Jenner Bud Light Classic at
San Jose City College, as well as all
the way across the country, where the
team will take part in the Eastern
Airlines Florida State Invitational.
The names may sound a bit com
mercial. But, in the track world, big
sponsors mean big meets and good
competition, and that's exactly what
the team is after.
The Florida State meet will bring
together many of the best women's
teams in the country, including
Louisiana State and a Texas squad
Johnson called "an awesome team.'"

Johnson will accompany eight ot
the team's top women who have
qualified for the meet.
Seniors Alison Wiley and Ceci
Hopp. sophomore Christa Curtin and
freshman Kim Stevens will run the
distance races. Seniors Pam Board
and Denise Gatzambide. along with
freshman Dawn Wilson, will enter the
hurdles.
Sophomore Lisa Bernhagen, who
has already qualified for the NCAAs
with a jump of 6-0. will take part in
the high jump.
Back in San Jose. Stanford Asst.
Coach Dave Wollman will be in
charge of 12 more of the team's bet
ter athletes, who will vie in the Jen
tier's tough field.
Highlighting the meet for the Card -
inal will be senior jumper Phil Can

non and discus throwers Karen Dick
erson. Patty Purpur and Pam Dukes.
Returning last week from an in
jury, Cannon competed for the first
time this year and placed third in the
meet. His reemergence as a top
jumper could be very important to
the team as the season progresses.
Recently, Dukes has been on a tear
in the shotput. Improving constantly,
she has moved into ninth place on the
all-time NCAA list, and she is a
threat to break the school record held
by Carol Cady.
But this week Wollman has opted
to rest her in the shotput. The move is
designed to get Dukes up to her full
potential for next week's Mt. Sac
Relays, in which she may be compet
ing head to head v\ ith Cady.
