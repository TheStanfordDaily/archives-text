# Academic Council to meet next month
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The full University Academic Council will
meet May 1 to discuss faculty benefits, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy an
nounced at a Faculty Senate meeting here
yesterday.
The meeting will focus on broad benefit is
sues such as faculty housing and medical
plans, services "that draw the University into
ever more complex relationships with its fac
ulty and senior staff as landlord, financial
counselor (and) assistant in various impor
tant matters in financial choice," Kennedy
said.
The Academic Council is a formal organi
zation of all of the more than 1,000 members
of the Stanford professoriate. The Faculty
Senate serves as a representative body of the
council. Because the council has ceded much

of its power to the senate, the regular council
meetings are considered somewhat of a joke
in faculty circles because of their poor atten
dance.
Kennedy humorously referred to his
presentation as one intended for "members
of this senate and to the members of the
Academic Council who may augment it, if
any."
Several senate members are leading ef
forts to restore powers to the once-august
body. Following criticism from English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz and Mathematics Prof. Hal
sey Royden, a proposal to abolish mandated
annual council meetings was withdrawn from
consideration at an April 3 senate meeting.
Ironically, the same proposal drew praise
for restoring the power of the council to call
meetings by petition. Petitioned meetings
would be the most likely method of
appealing senate decisions.
Under the proposal, no official ac
tion could be taken if fewer than 20
percent of council members attended
a petitioned meeting.
Since the senate was created in
1968, none of its decisions has been
reversed on appeal to the full council.
