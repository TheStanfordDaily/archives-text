# Sailors confident entering races

### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
The collegiate sailing season is swiftly coming to
an end â€” maybe too swiftly for the Stanford sailing
team's liking.
Coming off of outstanding performances in its
last regattas, the team is in top form and hoping to
keep its winning ways going as it heads into the
North Series Seven and Team Regatta this
weekend in Santa Cruz.
"I'm predicting us winning on Saturday and Sun
day," Stanford Coach Joe Petrucci said. 'Til be
very disappointed if we don't win both."

This year the Cardinal has had little trouble an
nihilating the Northern California schools it will
face this weekend. Tomorrow will feature the
seventh and last races in the North Series which
Stanford has virtually dominated. The top six teams
from these races will go to the district qualifiers
featuring teams from all of California.
"We've got this one sewn up going in." Petrucci
said.
Sunday, the Cardinal will field three of its top
skipper-crew combinations in the team racing com
petition. The top two schools in this will meet the
top two schools from Southern California in three
weeks.

More importantly this weekend, the quickly im
proving Cardinal women's team will have a chance
to test the water first hand in Santa Cruz in prepa
ration for its national qualifiers to be held there
next weekend.
The high winds and big waves at Santa Cruz can
defeat a team as easily as any competition.
Petrucci said he has high hopes for the women's
team after changing its training program and
reactivating a number of sailors.
Ihis weekend will also provide sailing time for
the rest of the team. Eight Stanford boats will be
entered encompassing nearly all team combina
tions.
