# Stanford winning streak ends quickly at one game
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff writer 
Perhaps still celebrating yesterday's first-ever Pacific
West League victory, the Stanford women's softball team
ended its short-lived winning streak, falling to U.S. Inter
national University 5-0 in the first game of the round
robin Western Region Tournament.
USIU, an "up and down team," according to Stanford
Coach Cathy Lincoln, did all of its damage in the third in
ning, batting around the order until five runs had been
scored.
Stanford helped its opponent's cause by committing
some unfortunate fielding errors, including one dropped
ball that continued the rally. The Cardinal had previously
played the last two games without an error.
"They had the breaks. It (the loss) was probably a let
down from yesterday," Lincoln said. "We were a little
tired too."
Stanford starting pitcher Lisa Buchanan was one player
who most likely felt the effect of fatigue. Not only did Bu
chanan pitch yesterday's game, but she also completed the
doubleheader against Arizona in the last scheduled series.
Lincoln acknowledged that Buchanan did tire and per

haps "tried too hard to do it by herself."
Buchanan received little bolstering from Stanford bats,
however. Of late, the Cardinal offense has stagnated
somewhat, to put it mildly. In fact, in the last two games,
Stanford has only managed four hits.
"We weren't aggressive at the plate. Couple of hits â€”
couldn't get a rally going. . . Lincoln said.
Despite the loss, Lincoln was not all that troubled. "It
(the loss) was a disappointment in that we had such a high
yesterday (victory over Arizona). We were a little
drained."
Stanford will hope to switch back to its winning ways
when it faces California and New Mexico today.
The Bears should prove to be an formidable adversary
given their top-10 national ranking.
Stanford will start the indestructable Buchanan for both
games. By the end of today's games, Buchanan will have
pitched five games in three days.
A loss in either of today's games will eliminate the
Cardinal from tournament action. Currently, Cal and
USIU are 1-0 while Stanford and New Mexico are 0-1 in
this particular Western Region tournament grouping.
The two teams with the best records will advance fur
ther into the Cross-pool round robin.
