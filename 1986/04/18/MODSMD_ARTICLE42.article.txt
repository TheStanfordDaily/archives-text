U.S. orders personnel out of Sudan
KHARTOUM, Sudan — Fearing a Libyan terrorist attack, the U.S.
Embassy here has ordered its "nonessential" personnel and all depen
dents to pack their bags and prepare to be evacuated by chartered
aircraft.
Most American employees of U.N. agencies and their dependents also
were ordered yesterday to leave the city, where a U.S. Embassy em
ployee, William Calkins, was shot in the head Tuesday night in what
U.S. officials here believe was a reprisal for the U.S. bombing of Libya.
U.S. officials here said yesterday that Calkins, an embassy communi
cations specialist, has suffered a serious brain injury and is partially
paralyzed from the bullet wound. He was flown Wednesday to a hospital
in Saudi Arabia where he was reported in stable condition after surgery.
The official Suna news agency reported that Sudan had recalled its
ambassador in Washington, Salah Ahmed, to protest the U.S. attack on
Libya.
An embassy spokesman said yesterday the evacuation was ordered
"because of the deteriorating security situation in Khartoum, the shoot
ing of the American and the calls for anti-American attacks by the
Libyan government."
In the past month, the Sudanese government has dramatically im
proved its relations with Libya while relations with the United States
Between 350 and 400 Americans were scheduled to leave Khartoum
early this morning by chartered aircraft to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. officials
said. Additional evacuation flights are scheduled for this weekend.
Child torture in S. Africa denounced
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — An American human-rights
monitoring group charged yesterday that among the thousands of black
children arrested, some as young as 10 have been tortured and more
than 200 killed by South African police over the past year in their efforts
to crush opposition to the minority white government.
The New York-based Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights con
cluded in a detailed and carefully documented report of police and army
brutality against black children that, "far from being spared the brunt of
repression, these children have often been singled out as special targets
of state-sanctioned violence."
Using figures compiled from government reports, the group notes that
209 children under 16 were killed in the sustained civil unrest here from
January 1985, through mid-February 1986, and that 2,106 were
detained without charge under the state of emergency from July to
March, a full 25 percent of all those held.
Even more shocking to the monitoring group, however, was the pat
tern of frequent and widespread torture of children as young as 10 and
11 by the police. More than 30 cases are cited in the report of children
who were beaten, whipped, abused sexually, deprived for days of sleep
and food and tortured with electric shocks.
For instance, Joseph, 14, whose last name was withheld in the report
for his protection, says he was arrested while playing soccer and held for
nine days at an army camp. He said soldiers had burned him with ciga
rette lighters, cut him with broken bottles and shocked him repeatedly
with electric current. His hands were twisted and blackened from the
shocks, the report said, and his body badly scarred from the burns and
cuts inflicted on him.
Of the 12 persons who died while detained under South Africa's se
curity laws last year, three were children, according to the report.
While acknowledging that black youths, many in their teens, were in
the forefront of anti-apartheid rioting over the past year and a half, the
report says that the security forces' "net has been cast so widely and in
discriminately" that their clear intention is to "control, intimidate and
incarcerate those involved in political protest."
Honecker sees worsening relations
BERLIN — East German Communist leader Erich Honecker,
opening a party congress in East Berlin with visiting Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev looking on, yesterday echoed Moscow's warnings about
worsening East-West relations but reaffirmed his own agenda of foreign
policy initiatives and resistance to change in domestic policy.
In an address to the congress of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of
Germany, which is held every five years, Honecker scrapped a moderate
statement of "deep regret" over the U.S. air attack against Libya in his
prepared text and issued a toughened condemnation reporting "anger
and dismay" over what he called the "barbaric bombing" by American
planes.
With Gorbachev sitting behind him and conspicuously making notes,
Honecker repeated the language of a Warsaw Pact statement issued
after Gorbachev's arrival here yesterday and said the American raid
would have "an adverse effect" on the situation in Europe "and the
East-West dialogue in general."
At the same time, Honecker said that East Germany would continue
to seek "business-like dialogue," expanded economic cooperation and
"a return to detente" with the West, and he made clear that Gorbachev's
shake-up of Soviet management and call for "radical reform'' would not
be repeated here.
The splicing of a longer and stronger denunciation of the United
States into the keynote address suggested the pressure on Honecker to
repeat the hard Soviet line on the U.S.-Libya conflict for an audience
that included Gorbachev as well as Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, who also is visiting here.
However, western analysts here said Honecker's speech underlined
East Germany's aim of increasing ties with West Germany and seeking
new western technology for its industry despite the increase in Soviet-
U.S. tensions. Among five priorities listed by Honecker for the coming
years were "consistent efforts to expand relations of peaceful coexis
tence with capitalist states."
Botha promises reforms in August
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Pieter Botha an
nounced yesterday that he will convene a special session of Parliament in
August to enact long-promised reforms to ease racial segregation and
give the black majority a voice in national decision-making.
Botha, disclosing the government's first timetable for reforms, said the
focus of the unprecedented special session will be the establishment of a
new "national council" to work out a new constitution. He said the
council will include black leaders as well as whites, Indians and mixed
race people.
Also on the parliamentary agenda, Botha said, will be legislation to
reorganize local and provincial governments to give urban blacks effec
tive management of their communities and put their representatives into
higher bodies.
The government is also committed to repealing laws that for decades
have prevented blacks from moving into urban areas and have required
them to carry government passes that allow them to enter cities legally
reserved for whites. And it has promised to enact legislation permitting
blacks to own their homes and businesses.

shake-up of Soviet management and call for "radical reform'' would not
be repeated here.
The splicing of a longer and stronger denunciation of the United
States into the keynote address suggested the pressure on Honecker to
repeat the hard Soviet line on the U.S.-Libya conflict for an audience
that included Gorbachev as well as Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, who also is visiting here.
However, western analysts here said Honecker's speech underlined
East Germany's aim of increasing ties with West Germany and seeking
new western technology for its industry despite the increase in Soviet-
U.S. tensions. Among five priorities listed by Honecker for the coming
years were "consistent efforts to expand relations of peaceful coexis
tence with capitalist states."
Botha promises reforms in August
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Pieter Botha an
nounced yesterday that he will convene a special session of Parliament in
August to enact long-promised reforms to ease racial segregation and
give the black majority a voice in national decision-making.
Botha, disclosing the government's first timetable for reforms, said the
focus of the unprecedented special session will be the establishment of a
new "national council" to work out a new constitution. He said the
council will include black leaders as well as whites, Indians and mixed
race people.
Also on the parliamentary agenda, Botha said, will be legislation to
reorganize local and provincial governments to give urban blacks effec
tive management of their communities and put their representatives into
higher bodies.
The government is also committed to repealing laws that for decades
have prevented blacks from moving into urban areas and have required
them to carry government passes that allow them to enter cities legally
reserved for whites. And it has promised to enact legislation permitting
blacks to own their homes and businesses.

TOKYO — A Japanese explorer has successfully walked to the North
Pole and back from a small village in northern Canada, it was learned
yesterday.
Mitsuro Oba. 32. of Tokyo, completed the 34-day roundtrip when he
arrived back in Resolute on Cornwallis Island in Canada's northwest ter
ritories. on Wednesday, according to a spokesman for him.
He is believed to be the first man to make a successful roundtrip on
foot to the North Pole. 280 miles from Resolute, the spokesman said.
A support plane had confirmed his arrival at the pole.
U.S. orders personnel out of Sudan
KHARTOUM, Sudan — Fearing a Libyan terrorist attack, the U.S.
Embassy here has ordered its "nonessential" personnel and all depen
dents to pack their bags and prepare to be evacuated by chartered
aircraft.
Most American employees of U.N. agencies and their dependents also
were ordered yesterday to leave the city, where a U.S. Embassy em
ployee, William Calkins, was shot in the head Tuesday night in what
U.S. officials here believe was a reprisal for the U.S. bombing of Libya.
U.S. officials here said yesterday that Calkins, an embassy communi
cations specialist, has suffered a serious brain injury and is partially
paralyzed from the bullet wound. He was flown Wednesday to a hospital
in Saudi Arabia where he was reported in stable condition after surgery.
The official Suna news agency reported that Sudan had recalled its
ambassador in Washington, Salah Ahmed, to protest the U.S. attack on
Libya.
An embassy spokesman said yesterday the evacuation was ordered
"because of the deteriorating security situation in Khartoum, the shoot
ing of the American and the calls for anti-American attacks by the
Libyan government."
In the past month, the Sudanese government has dramatically im
proved its relations with Libya while relations with the United States
Between 350 and 400 Americans were scheduled to leave Khartoum
early this morning by chartered aircraft to Nairobi, Kenya, U.S. officials
said. Additional evacuation flights are scheduled for this weekend.
Child torture in S. Africa denounced
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — An American human-rights
monitoring group charged yesterday that among the thousands of black
children arrested, some as young as 10 have been tortured and more
than 200 killed by South African police over the past year in their efforts
to crush opposition to the minority white government.
The New York-based Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights con
cluded in a detailed and carefully documented report of police and army
brutality against black children that, "far from being spared the brunt of
repression, these children have often been singled out as special targets
of state-sanctioned violence."
Using figures compiled from government reports, the group notes that
209 children under 16 were killed in the sustained civil unrest here from
January 1985, through mid-February 1986, and that 2,106 were
detained without charge under the state of emergency from July to
March, a full 25 percent of all those held.
Even more shocking to the monitoring group, however, was the pat
tern of frequent and widespread torture of children as young as 10 and
11 by the police. More than 30 cases are cited in the report of children
who were beaten, whipped, abused sexually, deprived for days of sleep
and food and tortured with electric shocks.
For instance, Joseph, 14, whose last name was withheld in the report
for his protection, says he was arrested while playing soccer and held for
nine days at an army camp. He said soldiers had burned him with ciga
rette lighters, cut him with broken bottles and shocked him repeatedly
with electric current. His hands were twisted and blackened from the
shocks, the report said, and his body badly scarred from the burns and
cuts inflicted on him.
Of the 12 persons who died while detained under South Africa's se
curity laws last year, three were children, according to the report.
While acknowledging that black youths, many in their teens, were in
the forefront of anti-apartheid rioting over the past year and a half, the
report says that the security forces' "net has been cast so widely and in
discriminately" that their clear intention is to "control, intimidate and
incarcerate those involved in political protest."
Honecker sees worsening relations
BERLIN — East German Communist leader Erich Honecker,
opening a party congress in East Berlin with visiting Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev looking on, yesterday echoed Moscow's warnings about
worsening East-West relations but reaffirmed his own agenda of foreign
policy initiatives and resistance to change in domestic policy.
In an address to the congress of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of
Germany, which is held every five years, Honecker scrapped a moderate
statement of "deep regret" over the U.S. air attack against Libya in his
prepared text and issued a toughened condemnation reporting "anger
and dismay" over what he called the "barbaric bombing" by American
planes.
With Gorbachev sitting behind him and conspicuously making notes,
Honecker repeated the language of a Warsaw Pact statement issued
after Gorbachev's arrival here yesterday and said the American raid
would have "an adverse effect" on the situation in Europe "and the
East-West dialogue in general."
At the same time, Honecker said that East Germany would continue
to seek "business-like dialogue," expanded economic cooperation and
"a return to detente" with the West, and he made clear that Gorbachev's
shake-up of Soviet management and call for "radical reform'' would not
be repeated here.
The splicing of a longer and stronger denunciation of the United
