Police foil attempt to blow up jet at London's Heathrow Airport

BEIRUT, Lebanon and LONDON â€” Three
kidnapped Britons were found shot to death near
Beirut yesterday, a British journalist was seized by
gunmen and the British ambassador's vacated
residence was shelled in a new outbreak of vio
lence, apparently in retaliation for Britain's support
of the U.S. raid on Libya.
Meanwhile in London. Israeli security guards at
Heathrow Airport found a bomb set to explode in
the air with an Irish woman about to board an El A 1
flight to Tel Aviv.
The attacks in Lebanon came two days after a
group headed by pro-Libyan terrorist leader Abu
Nidal declared here that "Palestinian, Arab and
revolutionary forces" would "answer back harshly
in pursuing and striking against" U.S. interests and
"countries that have given in to pressures" from
the United States.
A note found near the bodies of the three British
captives, all reportedly killed by gunshot wounds at
close range, threatened more violence in retaliation
for this week's raid on Libya and said that "U.S.
and British imperialism and their interests will be
our targets."
While the British Embassy withheld official iden
tification of the three slain men, friends, an Irish
diplomat who viewed the bodies at the American
University Hospital and doctors there said they
were journalist Alec Collett, 63, and teachers
Philip Padfield, 40, and Leigh Douglas, 34.
Collett, who worked for the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency, had been kidnapped on March 25,
1985. Padfield, director of a language center, and
Douglas, a political science professor at the Ameri

can University of Beirut, had been seized together
on a Beirut street last March 28.
Earlier yesterday, the ornate, white-stone man
sion that is the official residence of Britain's ambas
sador here was attacked by rocket-propelled
grenades. Three grenades pierced the walls of the
building, in Moslem west Beirut, near the Green
Line dividing the city, but there were no casualties,
British officials said. Ambassador John Gray, who
inspected the damage, has been living elsewhere
recently.
About two hours after the attack on the embassy
residence, the acting bureau chief of WTN, the
London-based Worldwide Television News, John
Patrick McCarthy, 29, was grabbed by four gun
men on his way to Beirut International Airport for
a flight to London. He was accompanied by
Lebanese colleagues in a two-car convoy, but an
automobile blocked the road and forced them to
stop.
The Voice of Lebanon, a Christian-run radio sta
tion, said an anonymous caller speaking for the
Omar Mukhtar squad asserted it had attacked the
British Embassy residence, and a caller for the Or
ganization of Moslem Martyrs said his group ab
ducted McCarthy. Omar Mukhtar was a Libyan
who led the revolt against Italian rule in Libya.
Neither group had been heard of before.
The radio quoted the Omar Mukhtar caller as
saying the attack on the British ambassador's
residence had been carried out "in retaliation for
his government's support to the United States in
the attack against Libya."
Unconfirmed reports late last night claimed that
McCarthy had also been killed.

A bomb set to explode in midair was found by Is
raeli security guards at London's Heathrow airport
yesterday in the baggage of a woman about to
board an El Al flight to Tel Aviv.
Police said the woman, an Irish national who was
taken into custody, may have been duped into car
rying the bag by her boy friend, a man "of Arab
origin." They said the man, who arrived with her
at the airport but disappeared before the bomb was
discovered, was "known to her" by the name of
Nezar Hindawi, but they did not provide his
nationality.
While there was no public evidence to link the
attempted bombing to Monday's attack by U.S.
planes on Libya, many here believed it to be an at
tempted retaliation for the use of British air bases
to launch the U.S. strike.
Yesterday's terrorist acts heightened a sense of
anxiety among many Britons over the implications
of the air attack on Libya. There was widespread
mention of the fact that Britain, rather than the
United States, had been the first to feel the brunt of
retaliation.
In Parliament, news of the airport bomb and
events in Lebanon brought further criticism of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In an angry ex
change yesterday afternoon, opposition Labor
Party leader Neil Kinnock accused her of
"provoking terrorism" by giving British approval
and assistance to the U.S. attack.
Liberal Party leader David Steel said that by
backing the U.S. plan, Thatcher had exposed
British citizens to retaliation by Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy and those he supports.
