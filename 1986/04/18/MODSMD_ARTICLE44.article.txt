# Khadafy was a target in U.S. attack

WASHINGTON â€” The U.S.
bombing raid on Libya was planned
with hopes that Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy would be killed
when the principal target, his com
mand post, was destroyed with four
2,000-pound bombs, informed offi
cials said yesterday.
"We hoped we would get him,"
one U.S. official involved in planning
the raid said, "but nobody was sure
where he would be that night."
National Security Council officials
had even drafted a statement for Ad
ministration use which described
Khadafy's death as "fortuitous," an
other Administration official said
yesterday, but the statement was
withheld after Khadafy apparently

escaped the effects of raid Monday
night.
Navy and Air Force pilots par
ticipating in the attack were not told
during pre-strike briefings that the in
tent of their mission was to kill
Khadafy, one knowledgeable source
said, but Khadafy's residential com
pound and personal tent were not put
off limits to attackers. The strike plan
called for at least one F-l 11 bomber
to blast Khadafy's compound with
four 2,000-pound bombs in the
knowledge that the bursts could
damage everything in the vicinity.
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes and Defense Department
spokesman Robert Sims refused to
comment yesterday on whether
Khadafy's house was targeted. Refer

ring to a videotape displayed yester
day of Air Force laser-guided bombs
going into the military barracks at the
Khadafy compound, Sims said: "We
have shown you the attack, and we hit
what we aimed at."
Sims, when asked whether drop
ping four 2,000-pound bombs on
Khadafy's compound violated the ex
ecutive ban against assassinating
heads of state, replied: "We did not
know where he was. We did know
where the nerve center for terrorist
training was, and that's what we at
tacked. That was the target and not
any individual."
In a related story, yesterday Shultz
said that the overthrow of Khadafy by
military coup would be "all to the
good" and that the targets in Mon

(Jay's U.S. raid were selected to make
an impression on Libya's armed
forces.
Shultz, meeting with reporters at
the State Department, denied that
Khadafy was "a direct target" of the
raid, but his remarks approving of a
coup and describing the target
selection process left no doubt that
toppling the mercurial Libyan leader
was, and still is, a prime objective of
official U.S. policy.
Shultz said he lacks sufficient infor
mation to say if there is "movement
toward a coup" in Libya. A White
House official said U.S. intelligence
reports indicate that one military unit
rebelled against Khadafy Wednesday
but that the Libyan air force put the
rebellion down.
