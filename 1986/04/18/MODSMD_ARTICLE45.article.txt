U.S. economy expanding
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy ex
panded at an unexpectedly solid 3.2 percent an
nual rate during the first three months of the
year, the Department of Commerce said yester
day in a preliminary report tha 112 suggested the
long-awaited turnaround in the huge U.S. trade
deficit is at last beginning.
Exports were up nearly 12 percent and imports
were reported down more than 3 percent, while
the report showed inflation slowing from a 3.9
percent annual rate in late 1985 to 2.2 percent
last quarter — "the lowest rate in 14 years" as
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige put it.
He said "prospects are good" for achieving the
Administration's goal of 4 percent growth during
all of 1986.
Administration officials and private
economists reacted cautiously to the encouraging
trade news, pointing out that the figures include
import statistics only for the month of January
and could be revised downward when more com

plete data is received.
Nonetheless, many government and private
economists agreed that the combined effects of
lower interest rates, cheaper oil, low inflation and
a weaker dollar have built a platform for steady
growth for at least the rest of the year.
Pulitzers awarded
The Denver Post was awarded the Pulitzer
Prize for meritorious public service yesterday for
its "in-depth study of missing children, which
revealed that most are involved in custody
disputes or are runaways, and which helped
mitigate national fears stirred by exaggerated sta
tistics."
The public service award, which carries a gold
medal award but no cash and is awarded to a
newspaper rather than to individual journalists,
has traditionally been the most coveted of the
journalism Pulitzers since the awards were first
made in 1917. The other awards carry a prize of

$1,000 each. The Pulitzer Prize for fiction was
awarded this year to "Lonesome Dove" by Larry
McMurtry.
Anti-terrorist measures
WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole ( R-Kan.) joined yesterday in intro
ducing legislation that would give the president
vastly expanded powers to respond to terrorist
attacks, including possible authority to order as
sassinations in some cases.
The measure would exempt counter-terrorist
actions from constraints on presidential authority
that were imposed by the Vietman-era War
Powers Resolution.
In responding to terrorist attacks, the president
would no longer be required to consult with
Congress before sending U.S. troops into hostile
situations.
This proposal runs counter to earlier pressure
from other congressional leaders.
