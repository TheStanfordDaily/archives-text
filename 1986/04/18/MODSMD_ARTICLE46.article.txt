Bouvia still plans suicide
LANCASTER — Doctors removed a force
feeding tube yesterday from quadriplegic
Elizabeth Bouvia, responding to a state appellate
court ruling that upheld her long-standing plea to
starve herself to death.
However, while Bouvia is "very happy" and
has returned to a minimal liquid diet, she still
plans to commit suicide through starvation as
soon as she can transfer to another medical
facility and leave the Los Angeles County-run
hospital that has fought her wish to die, her attor
ney said.
"It's still her intention to meet her fate without
unnecessary delay when that can be done in com
fortable and non-hostile circumstances," said at
torney Richard Scott, who a team of volun
teer American Civil Liberties Union lawyers
representing Bouvia. "But it won't be now."
Scott noted that Bouvia, a patient at the
county's High Desert Hospital in Lancaster, has
long tried without success to find another hospi
tal or nursing facility where she could resume
starving herself without interference.
"She has to have somewhere else to go and
have a support system in place and that's tough."
Scott said.
Her attorneys have contacted numerous
facilities on Bolivia's behalf, but have been

unable to find one that will take heron her terms.
In the eyes of many hospitals her case goes
beyond traditional right-to-die ethics. Doctors
have predicted that Bolivia, a 28-year-old victim
of cerebral palsy, could live another 15 or 20
years with adequate nutrition. Hospital officials
feel that they will be participating in a killing if
they allow her to carry out her plans.
County attorneys said yesterday they were
close to deciding to appeal Wednesday's strongly
worded and unanimous ruling by the 2nd District
Court of Appeal that sided with Bouvia.
The court said Bouvia has an absolute right to
refuse force-feeding or any other unwanted
medical treatment, "even if (it) creates a life
threatening condition."
Doonesbury fans angry
LOS ANGELES — Protests are pouring in to
newspapers that pulled this week's Doonesbury
cartoon strips, such as the Los Angeles Times,
which received more than 840 complaints includ
ing 164 subscription cancellations.
The furor surrounds six strips by cartoonist
Garry Trudeau that satirize the number of
Reagan Administration officials who have
departed under a cloud.
At least five papers pulled the strips, some

pointing to the potential for lihel suits and others
saying Irudeau was unfair in the cartoons or
looking for publicity.
"So here it is," character Mark Slackrrleyer, a
fictitious radio talk show host, says in the first
strip, "the definitive list of backscratchers, till -
dippers and conscience-cutters, the unabridged
1986 'Sleaze on Parade.' "
Th„- list includes Raymond Donovan, Anne
Burford, Clarence Pendleton, Rita Lavelle,
William Casey, Richard Allen and James Watt.
"The thing was unfair," William Thomas,
editor and executive vice president of the Times,
said Wednesday.
The l imes said it decided not to run the strip
"because it makes felonies out of misdemeanors
and lumps together the miscreants with those
who are not wrongdoers — the ding-dongs with
the real bad guys,"
Festive weather ahead
Today will be sunny and warmer with highs 65
to 75 and northwest winds to 20 mph during the
afternoon near the ocean with light variable
winds elsewhere. Tonight will be fair with lows in
the 40s and low 50s. Tomorrow will be sunny and
mild with highs from the upper 60s to the near
80s.
