# A 						Letter From the Editor
## 
### 
"Where are you going to get
the $50 to pay for the short fic
tion? Is it going to come from
your salary or what?" asked my
editor several weeks back.
It is, of course, her job to su
pervise the financial well-being of
The Daily (in addition to caring
for the day-to-day editing of the
newspaper and the adolescent
egos of its writers), I thought, so
her question seemed appropriate,
if slightly offensive, at the time.
It so happened in the ensuing
weeks that budget constraints
forced me to reduce my salary to
allow for the $50 expenditure
each magazine for the short fic
tion. My editor's question
(mirabile dictu) turned out to be
more appropriate than I had
hoped it would be (admittedly,
since she oversees the budget, her
prophetic question was in many
ways self-fulfilling, but ignore this
small detail and you'll get a better
story).
In losing $50 from my salary to
pay for the short fiction, I pon
dered how much short fiction was

really worth. (As a sidenote, I just
lost my entire pay for organizing
the magazine this quarter. As I
write this, I just had it taken away
from me. Really.)
As I wind up this letter and
scurry home to the safety of isola
tion (disconnecting the phone and
locking the door and playing the
stereo real loud with headphones
on), I would simply like to note
that the more I think about it, the
more short fiction seems to be
worth whatever it costs.
Why? 1 don't really know, ex
cept to offer that good fiction ex
plores human nature more deeply
than than a library of
anthropological, sociological and
physiological books, more inter
estingly than an albumful of
pictures (supposedly worth a
thousand words each), and more
honestly than your goddamn
mother.
