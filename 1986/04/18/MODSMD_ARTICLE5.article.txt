# The 						1906 quake: some shaky lessons
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Death and destruction have been
the fate of San Francisco. Shaken
by a tretfiblor at 5:13 o'clock yes
terday morning, the shock lasting
for 48 seconds and scourged by
flames that ranged diametrically in
all directions, the city is a mass of
smouldering ruins.

Eighty years ago this lead ran
boldly across the front page of the
San Francisco Call-Chronicle-.
Examiner. The 1906 San Fran
cisco earthquake had demolished
the city and created groundshake
that was felt from Oregon to San
Diego.
Caused by a 270-mile long
rupture along the San Andreas
fault, the 1906 quake killed 700
people and caused the Great Fire
that charbroiled most of San Fran
cisco, particularly the areas south
of the Market District.
Why rehash this catastrophe,
you may ask? Well, just as the
greatest sports coaches perfect

their teams by teaching players not
to make the same mistakes twice,
the utility of historical events lies
in their ability to show man his
past blunders and offer an alter
nate, more desirable course of ac
tion for the future.
If measures are not taken to
mitigate the destructive potential
of earthquakes, the catastrophic
effects of 1906 can be duplicated,
or worse, according to James
Gere, professor of civil engineer
ing at Stanford.
It is in this spirit of earthquake
damage prevention that Stanford,
UC-Berkeley, the California In
stitute of Technology and USC
have petitioned both state and
federal institutions for funds to es
tablish the California Earthquake
Engineering Center.
"The establishment of a center
will greatly increase the amount of
earthquake engineering research
we can do. Earthquake engineer
ing is designed to make our
structures — buildings, dams and
bridges — stronger and safer,"
Gere said.
"A relatively modest amount of
research can reap great dividends in
lives saved and property value les
sened during a great earthquake. A
little hit of research can save an awful
lot in damages later on. In essence,
research support is the cheapest in
surance we can buy," Gere added.
The specific organizations from
which the University expects to
receive grants are the National Sci
ence Foundation (NSF) on the
federal level and the State Education
Committee. "The California State
Seismic Committee will be overseeing
how the funds are distributed," said
Anne Kiremidjian, associate profes
sor of structural engineering at Stan
ford.
The State Education Committee
unanimously agreed to allocate $5
million to the center.
"At least $5 million is expected
from NSF," Kiremidjian said.
"If a center is not established in
California, most of the work that has
been done in research will stop. If
money is not appropriated, many of
the programs on earthquake engi
neering will be closed by the Univer

sity and, thus, we will not be educat
ing engineers who can design
structures to resist earthquakes and,
hence, reduce the damage.
"We are concerned with safety,
minimizing the potential of collapses
of buildings," Kiremidjian said.
In the future, damages caused by a
major earthquake in the Bay Area
"will have national consequences be
cause of the high concentration of cri
tical structures in areas like Silicon
Valley," she said.
She cited the defense and
electronics industries as two areas
that would be particularly hard hit if
high-tech structures in the Silicon
Valley were to be damaged or
destroyed by a large earthquake.
In a joint statement the four found
ing schools of the proposal stressed
the necessity of an earthquake engi
neering center in California to handle
the consequences of potential future
tremblors. They warned:
• " A moderate earthquake will prob
ably occur in central California within
two or three years;
• "Another great earthquake can be
expected in Southern California in
the next 20 years or so;

• "Increased earthquake activity in
the San Francisco Bay Area may sig
nal the return to a more normal con
dition of severe earthquake activity,
like in the late 1800s, which cul
minated in the great quake of 1906;
and
•"A damaging earthquake in San
Diego is not unlikely."
"Much of the life hazard posed by
earthquakes is associated with
damage to buildings. Since 1970, an
average of 40,000 people per year
have been killed by earthquake ef
fects on buildings, both new and old,
around the world. When the next
great quake strikes a major California
metropolitan area, the loss of life,
damage and disruption may come
close to that of the Civil War," the
statement said.
Later calculations made by this
reporter using a chart of earthquakes
occurring from 1970 to 1983 (that
appears in "Terra Non Firma" by
Gere and Haresh Shaw) showed the
actual figure to be slightly more than
30,000 people per year that had been
killed in earthquakes around the
world during that 14 year span.

If measures are not taken to
mitigate the destructive potential
of earthquakes, the catastrophic
effects of 1906 can be duplicated,
or worse, according to James
Gere, professor of civil engineer
ing at Stanford.
It is in this spirit of earthquake
damage prevention that Stanford,
UC-Berkeley, the California In
stitute of Technology and USC
have petitioned both state and
federal institutions for funds to es
tablish the California Earthquake
Engineering Center.
"The establishment of a center
will greatly increase the amount of
earthquake engineering research
we can do. Earthquake engineer
ing is designed to make our
structures — buildings, dams and
bridges — stronger and safer,"
Gere said.
"A relatively modest amount of
research can reap great dividends in
lives saved and property value les
sened during a great earthquake. A
little hit of research can save an awful
lot in damages later on. In essence,
research support is the cheapest in
surance we can buy," Gere added.
The specific organizations from
which the University expects to
receive grants are the National Sci
ence Foundation (NSF) on the
federal level and the State Education
Committee. "The California State
Seismic Committee will be overseeing
how the funds are distributed," said
Anne Kiremidjian, associate profes
sor of structural engineering at Stan
ford.
The State Education Committee
unanimously agreed to allocate $5
million to the center.
"At least $5 million is expected
from NSF," Kiremidjian said.
"If a center is not established in
California, most of the work that has
been done in research will stop. If
money is not appropriated, many of
the programs on earthquake engi
neering will be closed by the Univer

sity and, thus, we will not be educat
ing engineers who can design
structures to resist earthquakes and,
hence, reduce the damage.
"We are concerned with safety,
minimizing the potential of collapses
of buildings," Kiremidjian said.
In the future, damages caused by a
major earthquake in the Bay Area
"will have national consequences be
cause of the high concentration of cri
tical structures in areas like Silicon
Valley," she said.
She cited the defense and
electronics industries as two areas
that would be particularly hard hit if
high-tech structures in the Silicon
Valley were to be damaged or
destroyed by a large earthquake.
In a joint statement the four found
ing schools of the proposal stressed
the necessity of an earthquake engi
neering center in California to handle
the consequences of potential future
tremblors. They warned:
• " A moderate earthquake will prob
ably occur in central California within
two or three years;
• "Another great earthquake can be
expected in Southern California in
the next 20 years or so;

• "Increased earthquake activity in
the San Francisco Bay Area may sig
nal the return to a more normal con
dition of severe earthquake activity,
like in the late 1800s, which cul
minated in the great quake of 1906;
and
•"A damaging earthquake in San
Diego is not unlikely."
"Much of the life hazard posed by
earthquakes is associated with
damage to buildings. Since 1970, an
average of 40,000 people per year
have been killed by earthquake ef
fects on buildings, both new and old,
around the world. When the next
great quake strikes a major California
metropolitan area, the loss of life,
damage and disruption may come
close to that of the Civil War," the
statement said.
Later calculations made by this
reporter using a chart of earthquakes
occurring from 1970 to 1983 (that
appears in "Terra Non Firma" by
Gere and Haresh Shaw) showed the
actual figure to be slightly more than
30,000 people per year that had been
killed in earthquakes around the
world during that 14 year span.

Death and destruction have been
the fate of San Francisco. Shaken
by a tretfiblor at 5:13 o'clock yes
terday morning, the shock lasting
for 48 seconds and scourged by
flames that ranged diametrically in
all directions, the city is a mass of
smouldering ruins.

Feature

Eighty years ago this lead ran
boldly across the front page of the
San Francisco Call-Chronicle-.
Examiner. The 1906 San Fran
cisco earthquake had demolished
the city and created groundshake
that was felt from Oregon to San
Diego.
Caused by a 270-mile long
rupture along the San Andreas
fault, the 1906 quake killed 700
people and caused the Great Fire
that charbroiled most of San Fran
cisco, particularly the areas south
of the Market District.
Why rehash this catastrophe,
you may ask? Well, just as the
greatest sports coaches perfect

their teams by teaching players not
to make the same mistakes twice,
the utility of historical events lies
in their ability to show man his
past blunders and offer an alter
nate, more desirable course of ac
tion for the future.
