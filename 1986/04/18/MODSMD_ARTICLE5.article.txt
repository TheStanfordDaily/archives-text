# The
						1906 quake: some shaky lessons
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
Death and destruction have been
the fate of San Francisco. Shaken
by a tretfiblor at 5:13 o'clock yes
terday morning, the shock lasting
for 48 seconds and scourged by
flames that ranged diametrically in
all directions, the city is a mass of
smouldering ruins.

Eighty years ago this lead ran
boldly across the front page of the
San Francisco Call-Chronicle-.
Examiner. The 1906 San Fran
cisco earthquake had demolished
the city and created groundshake
that was felt from Oregon to San
Diego.
Caused by a 270-mile long
rupture along the San Andreas
fault, the 1906 quake killed 700
people and caused the Great Fire
that charbroiled most of San Fran
cisco, particularly the areas south
of the Market District.
Why rehash this catastrophe,
you may ask? Well, just as the
greatest sports coaches perfect

their teams by teaching players not
to make the same mistakes twice,
the utility of historical events lies
in their ability to show man his
past blunders and offer an alter
nate, more desirable course of ac
tion for the future.
If measures are not taken to
mitigate the destructive potential
of earthquakes, the catastrophic
effects of 1906 can be duplicated,
or worse, according to James
Gere, professor of civil engineer
ing at Stanford.
It is in this spirit of earthquake
damage prevention that Stanford,
UC-Berkeley, the California In
stitute of Technology and USC
have petitioned both state and
federal institutions for funds to es
tablish the California Earthquake
Engineering Center.
"The establishment of a center
will greatly increase the amount of
earthquake engineering research
we can do. Earthquake engineer
ing is designed to make our
structures — buildings, dams and
bridges — stronger and safer,"
Gere said.
"A relatively modest amount of
