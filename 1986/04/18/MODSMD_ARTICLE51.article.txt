'JPhe Hoover Institution creates custard
cup controversy for most students.
Weeks pass and lunch remains a time for pondering simple
things, such as the grainy texture of your Food Service pudding.
But sooner or later The Daily runs a story announcing the latest
criticism of Hoover, and, brandishing your custard cup, you again
knock heads with the loud-mouthed dorm Republican.
If University President Donald Kennedy's example is followed,
however, Hoover will cease to be a cause of indigestion in dorm
dining halls — or anywhere else on campus for that matter.
Kennedy, who only recently divulged that he ate lunch a few
months ago with Hoover s highest-ranking scholars, is one of the
leaders in what he describes as the broadest attempt in more than a
quarter of a century to improve Stanford/Hoover relations.
The effort at better relations, he said, involves people on both
sides, from trustees to librarians.
This turn of events comes slightly less than a year after a flurry
of reports and counter-reports on the state of Stanford/Hoover
dealings. Those four reports, of which the Ward Report and the
Dornbusch Report were most influential, raised ire at both institu
tions.
The Ward Report, prepared for the trustees committee on
Hoover, antagonized the faculty mainly for implying that the Poli
tical Science Department and, to a lesser extent, the History De
partment, had acted unprofessionally in its dealings with Hoover.
The Dornbusch Report, sponsored by the Faculty Senate, ir
ritated many at Hoover for suggesting that Hoover had a research
"agenda" and for recommending tighter University control of the
think tank.
Provost James Rosse, the University's chief academic officer,
said the reports may have inadvertantly shoved Hoover/University
relations to a low point not experienced since the early '70s.
After a time, however, tensions seem to have eased, and as the
reports were re-read, it became evident that they shared a com
mon theme: Closer cooperation could pay big dividends for both
sides.
Today, those involved in relations on a day-to-day basis say that
relations are not strained. Charges of Hoover's partisanship are
losing their force, and talk of separating Hoover from the Univer
sity, an idea tossed out by the Dornbusch committee, appears to be
just talk.
For those who have been told about Hoover's alleged right-wing
bias since day one, freshman year, the most startling aspect ot rela
tions is the lack of serious controversy among the faculty over
Hoover's "politics."

Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson, who served on the
Ward committee and compiled
the four recent reports in a
volume titled "Stanford and
Hoover and Academic
Freedom," said the debate over
partisanship has abated:
"Probably no more than a couple
of dozen people are exercised
about this."
Kennedy agrees. "A small
number of people believe that
Hoover's appointment process
serves political ends, and that
view has been rejected by the
Faculty Senate, by the Dornbusch
committee — I think by most
reasonable people."
Interviews with faculty mem
bers support his view.
Another matter that has at
tracted much public attention is
the prospect of divorcing Stan
ford from Hoover.
The Dornbusch committee was
the First University study ever to
air the possibility, saying that al
though divorce "is not a desirable
way to end the strains in this mar
riage (between Stanford and
Hoover), ... if events in the next
several years do not bring about
greater amity, divorce should be
reconsidered."
But, like the attention
grabbing partisanship contro
versy, this proposal has little
credence among decision makers.
Kennedy, for one, said he could
not see any circumstances under
which divorce would be an op
tion.
"I think," he said, "the
Dornbusch committee meant to
suggest an unacceptable conse
quence rather than a probable
outcome. I think the purpose of
the Dornbusch committee in
mentioning that was to underline
the seriousness of the alternative
that we do nothing and don't fix
anything."
Because of its narrow re
search interests, Hoover has
ongoing relations with only a
handful of University depart
ments. A recent Hoover publica
tion defines the institution as a
center for research on 20th cen
tury issues, with an emphasis on
public-policy research in econom
ics, history, political science,
sociology and education.
Interviews with officials in
many of the related University
schools and departments indicate
that faculty members have
profitable relationships with
Hoover:
• "Our relations have been very
cooperative," said Sociology
Chairman Joseph Berger, "and
there's every reason to believe it
will continue." Berger himself has
a courtesy appointment as a
Hoover senior fellow.
The Ward Report said that the
Sociology Department, ranked
13th nationally in 1969, im
proved its ranking to seventh by
1982 with substantial help from
Hoover.
"At least three of the depart
ment's most outstanding mem

bers are at Stanford because help
from Hoover made it possible for
the department either to attract
or retain them," the report says.
• John Shoven, vice-chairman of
the Economics Department, said,
"I think the vast majority of the
department would think it was a
very bad thing if Hoover were not
there."
The primary advantage,
Shoven said, is that Hoover ex
pands the number of economists
at Stanford. There are 70 to 80
people at the University who can
be called economists, he said, and
about 30 of them are from
Hoover. This adds to the intellec-

tual climate for economists and,
more specifically, to the amount
of new research presented at
campus economics seminars.
Shoven said that seminars play a
major role in inspiring scholars to
undertake their own research.
• "To me," said History Chair
man Paul Robinson, "it seems
(relations between History and
Hoover) have been extremely
cordial and cooperative." His
torians worship documents, Rob
inson said, and Hoover's world
renowned archives helps Stanford
in recruiting top-notch professors
and graduate students.
Hoover's presence can pay fur
ther dividends when the depart
ments professors receive lucrative
job offers from other schools. In
1985, for instance, "a very distin
guished historian" at Stanford
received an offer to teach at Har

vard, Robinson said.
Hoover helped the History De
partment counter Harvard's offer
by giving him a courtesy appoint
ment as a senior fellow. The pro
fessor, who wished to remain
anonymous, said the senior fellow
position carried with it money for
research and was an "important
consideraton" in his decision to
remain on the Farm.
The political science seems to
have the most tumultous relations
with Hoover, and even in this de
partment, criticism contrasts with
cooperation: Six members of the
department's faculty have posi
tions at Hoover.

Stanford Provost James Rosse
(left) and Hoover Principal Asso
ciate Director John Cogan, two
key players in the drive toward
better Hoover/University rela
tions, worked out a revised and
newly codified appointment
process for Hoover senior fellows,
the highest-ranking scholars at the
think tank.
The process, announced April 3
and diagrammed below, was
heralded as a promising move
along the lines of the Ward and
Dornbusch reports.

Political Science Prof. John
Manley is prominent among
those who are not happy
with the move toward more Stan
ford/Hoover interaction. Manley
said he does not care what
Hoovers politics are; he said that
he is disturbed that Hoover in
volves itself in politics at all.
The only way for Stanford to
preserve its academic image and
reputation is by divorcing itself
from Hoover, he believes.
"The basic premise," he
argues, "is that the University is
supposed to be apolitical.
"As a politically active institu
tion connected to Stanford,
(Hoover) is able to push its
causes, aided by Stanford and by
its name."
At distances greater than one
mile from campus, he said,
nobody makes a distinction be
tween Stanford and Hoover.

Jl'We're colored with the same
brush. ... If we allow Hoover to
continue, . . . our legitimacy as an
institution is at stake."
Manley, who with English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz has been one of
the most active anti-Hoover
crusaders on campus for a num
ber of years said, that his lon
gevity backs his point.
"I'm not known as a liar. If I
were, I'd have been easily dis
pensed with a long time ago."
He admits, however, that the
chances of divorce are slim, and
places himself on the "left-wing"
in the University debate over
Hoover.

The Ward and Dornbusch
reports have defined the is
sues of the debate for now.
Both reports see advantages to
greater cooperation, but the
Dornbusch report emphasizes
preliminary reforms that must be
made both within Hoover and in
the way the University oversees
Hoover.
To unlock the potential con
tained in Hoover and the Univer
sity, the studies advocate more in
formal interaction between
Hoover and Stanford scholars to
form a better intellectual commu
nity and more joint appointments
to lure illustrious scholars to the
Stanford campus.
Scholars with joint appoint
ments hold positions at both
Hoover and Stanford. The ar
rangements differ from case to
case, but would in "regular" in
stances mean that a scholars time

and salary were divided by a Uni
versity department and Hoover.
According to the Ward Report,
joint appointments have attracted
some of Hoover's most prestigous
staff members and have helped
University departments lure
scholars "who would have been
unwilling to come to Stanford
without the sorts of career enrich
ment, part-time research appoint
ments, and other inducements
that Hoover has made possible."
The biggest obstacle to more
joint appointments, the Ward
document says, are the depart
ments and schools of the Univer
sity. According to the report,
"The traffic in terms of joint ap
pointments has been notably one
sided. In the last 10 years, the
group has identified 15 cases
where Hoover made joint ap
pointments for University faculty
members and only two cases
where the University made joint
appointments for Hoover staff
members."
"On Hoover's side," the report
continues, "there is a distinct and
generally shared feeling that
there has been a notable lack of
reciprocity where joint appoint
ments are concerned, in short,
that they have done all the giving
and received little or nothing in
return."
The Ward committee blamed
Stanford's reluctance on
misplaced partisanship, notably
within the Political Science De
partment.
The Dornbusch reply was swift
and sharp. Simplifying the issue
to partisan politics is wrong, the
report says. Rather, the reasons
are complex and related more to
matters of governance.
The message of the Dornbusch
report is that the shortage of joint
appointments reflects problems in
communication between Hoover
and the University and a lack of
confidence on the part of the fac
ulty in the effectiveness of
Hoover's appointment process.
An April 3 address to the Fac
ulty Senate by Kennedy and
Rosse indicated that large steps
had been taken toward the resou
tion of both of the Dornbusch
problems.
• First, Rosse announced the pro
cedures that would be used in ap
pointing Hoover senior fellow.
Senior fellows are Hoover's
highest-ranking scholars.
This is significant because the
system of appointing senior fel
lows is now codified for the first
itme — one of three steps that the
Ward Report says "should be of
positive long-term value to the
clarity, efficacy and repute of
Hoover's appointment proce
dures."
And, according to Kennedy,
the codification should instill con
fidence in the Stanford faculty
that Hoover is hiring qualified re
searchers. In the absence of confi
dence, the Dornbusch Report
says, departments are less likely
to invite Hoover scholars to teach
courses and University professors

are more hesitant to collaborate
in research with their Hoover
counterparts.
• At the same meeting, Kennedy
said that Rosse and Hoover's
principal associate director, John
Cogan, are working together on
matters of mutual interest to
Hoover and the University. The
Dornbusch Report says this sort
of high-level communiction is ne
cessary to encourage joint ap
pointments and to create a more
regular flow of information on
visitors of mutual interest, confer
ences, funding opportunities, etc.
The psychological advances
may prove as important as the
concrete ones. As Kennedy put it,
"I think we've addressed one of
the more serious problems and
solved it successfully. That gives
us a lot of confidence that we can
attack the others."
The next major project for
Rosse and Cogan is re-evaluating
the definition of a Hoover senior
research fellow and the appoint'
ment procedure for that rank, ac
cording to Rosse.
Although Rosse hedges on how
long this will take, he said that he
expects that "by this time next
year, we will have accomplished a
great deal."
In many ways, Cogan and
Rosse will be the focal points
of the developing relationship.
They will be the key negotiators
in a period of reform. In an era
during which two major institu
tions will be growing closer, their
relationship will be the conduit
through which much crucial infor
mation flows.
Cogan, associate director of the
White House Office of Manage
ment and Budget until last fall, is
an economist who received his
Ph. Din 1976 from UCLA.
Rosse, an economics professor,
was formerly chairman of the
Economics Department and has
been at the University since the
19605.
Rosse downplays the role of
Cogan and himself. Kennedy and
Campbell still have the primary
relationship, he said. In addition,
"relations don't just depend on
Kennedy, Rosse, Campbell and
Cogan."
Cooperation at all levels — be
tween library curators as well as
tenured faculty — is important,
he said.
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell said that many of the
changes necessary for better rela
tions will have to come from the
University's side.
He labelled the Ward Report
"first-class" and approved the
recent changes announced by
Rosse. "I heartily subscribe," he
said in response to Rosse, "to the
spirit of cooperation and the posi
tive manner in which certain
problem areas have been ad
dressed."
On the other hand, he said the
lack of joint appointments
"doesn't bother me." Hoover,
Campbell said, has been more
than willing to make joint ap
pointments, and the obstinance of
University departments has kept
the numbers down.
As for relations with the Politi
cal Science Department, which
have proved especially
troublesome in the past, "they're
President Kennedy's problems;
they're not mine," Campbell said.
Kennedy said that relations are
now being approached in a broad
manner he has not seen since
coming to Stanford more than 25
years ago.
"We're going to look at all
facets of the relationship and
make sure that there isn't any
thing broken, and if there is
something broken, to work out
ways to fix it," Kennedy said.
The number of projects under
way at top levels of the University
indicate the depth of resolve:
Bob Freelen, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, said
the trustees' committee on the
Hoover Institution "has es
tablsihed a decision-making rela
tionship with the president of the
(Hoover Board of) Overseers," a
relationship that was not cul
tivated in the past.
Freelen himself will be assem
bling a committee to look at the
relationship with respect to public
affairs and publications, accord
ing to Kennedy.
Rosse told the Faculty Senate
that "an extensive review of li
brary personnel policies — in
cluding appointment procedures
— is now in its last stages." Both
Hoover and Stanford libraries
participated, he said.
But though faculty and admi
nistrators see considerable cause
for optimism .about Stan
ford/Hoover cooperation, they
are wary of re-igniting the con
flict.
Some faculty members refused
to talk in the belief that public at
tention on the Hoover contro
versy could spark tensions anew.
Many professors and administra
tors seemed to be especially
guarded in their remarks.
Freelen offered an explanation.
"I think there are a lot of
people on campus . . . who want
to put the high-intensity rhetoric
behind them," he said. The rheto
ric, Freelen added, "makes it
more difficult for the statesmen to
do their work."
"Maybe we could do better,"
said Hoover fellow George
Marotta, the institution's public
affairs director until 1984, "if
there were not so many studies
and reports and we could just go
back to doing our research." ■
