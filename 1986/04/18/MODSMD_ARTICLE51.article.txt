'JPhe Hoover Institution creates custard
cup controversy for most students.
Weeks pass and lunch remains a time for pondering simple
things, such as the grainy texture of your Food Service pudding.
But sooner or later The Daily runs a story announcing the latest
criticism of Hoover, and, brandishing your custard cup, you again
knock heads with the loud-mouthed dorm Republican.
If University President Donald Kennedy's example is followed,
however, Hoover will cease to be a cause of indigestion in dorm
dining halls â€” or anywhere else on campus for that matter.
Kennedy, who only recently divulged that he ate lunch a few
months ago with Hoover s highest-ranking scholars, is one of the
leaders in what he describes as the broadest attempt in more than a
quarter of a century to improve Stanford/Hoover relations.
The effort at better relations, he said, involves people on both
sides, from trustees to librarians.
This turn of events comes slightly less than a year after a flurry
of reports and counter-reports on the state of Stanford/Hoover
dealings. Those four reports, of which the Ward Report and the
Dornbusch Report were most influential, raised ire at both institu
tions.
The Ward Report, prepared for the trustees committee on
Hoover, antagonized the faculty mainly for implying that the Poli
tical Science Department and, to a lesser extent, the History De
partment, had acted unprofessionally in its dealings with Hoover.
The Dornbusch Report, sponsored by the Faculty Senate, ir
ritated many at Hoover for suggesting that Hoover had a research
"agenda" and for recommending tighter University control of the
think tank.
Provost James Rosse, the University's chief academic officer,
said the reports may have inadvertantly shoved Hoover/University
relations to a low point not experienced since the early '70s.
After a time, however, tensions seem to have eased, and as the
reports were re-read, it became evident that they shared a com
mon theme: Closer cooperation could pay big dividends for both
sides.
Today, those involved in relations on a day-to-day basis say that
relations are not strained. Charges of Hoover's partisanship are
losing their force, and talk of separating Hoover from the Univer
sity, an idea tossed out by the Dornbusch committee, appears to be
just talk.
For those who have been told about Hoover's alleged right-wing
bias since day one, freshman year, the most startling aspect ot rela
tions is the lack of serious controversy among the faculty over
Hoover's "politics."
