# The
						Hoover Rank File

### 
Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton
Friedman has gained household-name
recognition in the pages of Newsweek maga
zine. But a lesser-known fact about Friedman
is that he has been a Senior Research Fellow at
Hoover for the past 10 years. Currently, 39
scholars hold this rank.
Senior research fellows differ from senior
fellows in two major aspects: They do not
have voting rights on Hoover matters and they
hold term, as opposed to continuing, appoint
ments (these appointments generally last
three to five years), which, as in Friedman's
case, are renewable.
The appointment process for senior re
search fellows follows the basic framework as
that for senior fellows, Cogan said, except that
it is more informal "since we're not making as
much of a commitment to them as we are to
the senior fellows (who have continuing ap
pointments)."
Friedman continues to study the economy
as a monetarist, a point of view which won
him the 1976 Nobel Prize and made common
such phrases as "the natural rate of un
employment."

Though they don't share the spotlight as
much as the Senior Fellows or Senior Re
search Fellows do. Research Fellows such as
Fu-Mei Chen are an integral part of the insti
tution. Most of the 10 research fellows are in
volved in either overseeing archival or public
relations functions.
Chen is in charge of overseeing acquisitions
of Chinese material by the East Asian Collec
tion. In addition she conducts research on
Chinese economic history. On top of that, she
teaches a first-year law course on law in radi
cally different cultures.
Research fellows hold term appointments,
though the renewal of the appointment, ac
cording to Chen, is almost guaranteed. Chen
herself has been at the institution since 1977.
The research fellows are appointed in nearly a
similar way as the Hoover library staff; they
are appointed and serve at the director's plea
sure.

Confusing and unnecessarily
complex. The Hoover Institu
tion's system of academic ranks
is in need of overhaul, agreed the
Dornbusch and Ward reports.
When talk of overhaul is aired,
what often is overlooked are the
people who inhabit these ranks
and why they are where they are.

Economics Prof. Robert Hall also dons the
cap of Hoover Senior Fellow, a position he has
held since 1978. His primary research interest
examines what happens to firms during the
ups and downs of the economy and why the
economy suffers recessions. "Basically," he
explains, "it's the subject matter of Econ 52
(the course which he teaches)."
Senior fellow is the highest ranking aca
demic position at Hoover and carries the most
responsibility. Similar to tenured faculty (see
chart), the 23 senior fellows hold continuing
appointments (corresponding to tenure). In
addition, they have voting rights on Hoover
internal matters and are consulted by the
director in the choice of future senior fellows,
and play an important role in the selection of
future directors.
Hoover appointees, with the notable excep
tion of National Fellows, tend to be scholars
who are already established in their field and
have produced high caliber research, accord
ing to Principal Assoc. Director John Cogan.
That aspect differentiates the Hoover ap
pointment process from that of University de
partments, which might choose younger
scholars for their research and teaching poten
tial.

George Stigler, the 1982 Nobel Laureate in
economics, returns to Hoover nearly every
winter quarter as a Visiting Fellow from the
University of Chicago, where he holds an
endowed professorship of American Institu
tions. He is most widely regarded for his work
on the theory of economic regulation by gov
ernment agencies, a topic he still studies.
Potential visiting fellows apply through a
program similar in nature to the one for the
National Fellows. The applications are
reviewed by the senior fellows and other
scholars in each candidate's field. Approxi
mately five visiting fellows per quarter and 10
during the summer are chosen by the Hoover
director.
One year is the average length of stay for
visiting fellows, but, as is the case with Stigler,
whose first visit was in 1968, they may return.

National Fellow Condoleeza Rice's normal
habitat is the Department of Political Science,
where she holds the title of assistant professor.
Rice co-teaches the popular Soviet Foreign
Policy class, but last year decided, as do 60 to
80 scholars per year, to submit a proposal to
the highly regarded Hoover National Fellows
Program.
"We have a massive outreach campaign,"
says Cogan, adding that Hoover sends notices
concerning the program to every college and
university in the nation.
A two-day meeting of a collection of senior
fellows, senior research fellows and the direc
tor narrows the pool of applicants to the final
15 or so annual National Fellows, who spend
the following year at Hoover working on proj
ects that they might not otherwise be able to
undertake.
Rice is working on a comparative study of
Soviet and U.S. military staff organization, on
which she hopes to write a book eventually.
