# Governance, bias: enduring controversies
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
There is nothing controversial
about converting a library
into a think tank, unless the
think tank is related to a univer
sity and was born with a stated
mission "to demonstrate the evils
of the doctrines of Karl Marx."
Hoover Tower houses a con
troversial think tank.
The metamorphosis of Stan
ford University's Hoover War Li
brary into a research institution
whose scholars influence national
policy sparked disputes over aca
demic governance and political
bias that have endured for a quar
ter century.
It began in 1959 when Stan
ford's Board of Trustees ap
proved a legal charter for the
Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, replacing
a 1946 charter for the library.
The new charter delineated the
relationship of the Hoover to the
University and effectively shut
out Stanford faculty — respon
sible for governing the scholastic
and educational work of the Uni
versity — from any decision
making process or advisory role
regarding the institution. It stip
ulated that the director must be a
man who "reflects the purposes
of the institution" and gave the
institution's founder, Herbert
Hoover, strong control over the
choice of that man. It also
allowed the director great
freedom in managing the institu
tion.
Paragraph 3 states: "The
Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an inde
pendent institution within the
frame of Stanford University. Its
relation to the university is that

the president of the university will
propose all appointments, pro
motions and the budget of the in
stitution directly to the Board of
Trustees. There will be no refer
ence to any faculty committees
between the president and the
trustees."
Loud protest over the mission
of the institution, however, as
stated by Herbert Hoover and in
corporated into the charter, over
shadowed the governance issue.
Hoover wrote: "The purpose
of this institution must be, by its
research and publications, to
demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx —
whether Communism, Socialism,
economic materialism or atheism
— thus to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies,
their conspiracies, and to reaffirm
the validity of the American sys
tem."
Once published in The Daily,
Hoover's words provoked a
strong campus reaction.
The faculty formed an ad hoc
committee to draw up a statement
of academic freedom for the insti
tution, which was submitted to
the Board of Trustees with the re
quest that it replace Herbert
Hoover's statement. The trustees
acknowledged receipt of the com
mittee's document but took no
further action, according to Prof.
David Nivision, then associate
professor of Chinese and philoso
phy and a member of that faculty
committee.
A March 29, 1960 Daily edito
rial accompanying the full text of
Hoover's statement said: "We . . .
sincerely regret Mr. Hoover's
recent statement tying the goals
of the Hoover Institution to the

'purposes of the American
people' and the exposure of 'the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx . . ,' a statement which
flagrantly violates all the prin
ciples of scholarly investigation
and academic freedom."
Comments by professors pub
lished in The Daily April 3 and 4
echoed the regret and also
brought up the issue of gover
nance.
"The statement of Mr. Hoover
is incompatible with the univer
sity which is dedicated to the
freedom of the scholar and re
search for truth," wrote John
Johnston, professor of history.
Physics Prof. Sidney Drell

wrote: "It is alien to the discipline
in which I work to start with a
conclusion. The goal of research
and study is to describe events
and formulate and test hypothe
ses. If, in contrast, however, the
Hoover Institution has the
'purpose' as described in The
Daily, then I regret it."
Other professors worried more
that access to Hoovers archives
would be based on a researcher's
beliefs.
"The recent developments con
cerning the Hoover Institution
disturb me," wrote Physics Prof.
George Pake. "There have been
steps to remove the Hoover Insti
tution and its collection (which is
a priceless tool for research) from
normal cognizance of the faculty
which is, after all, the fountain
head of scholarship in the univer
sity."
Newly appointed Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell,
handpicked by Herbert Hoover,
said in a March 29, 1960 inter
view with The Daily that he was
aware of the faculty's alarm over
Hoover's statement.
"I see nothing wrong with it
(the statement), do you?" he
asked. To suggestions that such a
policy might violate true scholar
ship and result in predetermined
orientation of publications, he
replied: "There are evils in Mar
xism, and I hope we expose
them."
Campbell also indicated, ac
cording to the Daily article, that
while he hopes to maintain pleas
ant relations with the faculty and
faculty members were free to use
the Hoover's library facilities, he
was the one responsible for devel
oping and executing the research
program of the institution.

This lack of faculty oversight
to check the director's
powers lies at the heart of
the 25-year-old dispilte over
governance.
Exclusion of the faculty from
the process of appointing the in
stitution's staff and senior fellows
was especially irksome, and revi
sions in the Hoover/Stanford re
lationship centered on the ap
pointment procedure.
The faculty would like the
Hoover's selection process to be
as close as possible to the faculty's
process, according to University
News Service Director Bob
Beyers, who has reported on the
institution for about 20 years.
"How a person is selected is as
important as who is selected," he
said, explaining that the chief
source of discontent is not the
quality or type of people who are
senior fellows, but the manner in
which those people becomc
senior fellows.
This continual discontent
surfaced intermittently over the
years, and several changes in the
Hoover's appointment process
were made. External protests,
however, had litte influence in
bringing about these revisions,
according to Beyers. Negotiations
between the Hoover staff and
University administrators were
the instruments of change.
"Protesters often want immedi
ate change, but that usually does
not happen. There aren't any
quick changes and things change
through committess," Beyers
said. "The governance issue is
just going to grind on."

Members of the Faculty Senate vote on May 26, 1983, to urge the trustees to appoint a committee to look into
Hoover governance and appointment procedures — another manifestation of concern that has existed since
1960.
