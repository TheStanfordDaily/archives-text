# Governance, bias: enduring controversies
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
There is nothing controversial
about converting a library
into a think tank, unless the
think tank is related to a univer
sity and was born with a stated
mission "to demonstrate the evils
of the doctrines of Karl Marx."
Hoover Tower houses a con
troversial think tank.
The metamorphosis of Stan
ford University's Hoover War Li
brary into a research institution
whose scholars influence national
policy sparked disputes over aca
demic governance and political
bias that have endured for a quar
ter century.
It began in 1959 when Stan
ford's Board of Trustees ap
proved a legal charter for the
Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, replacing
a 1946 charter for the library.
The new charter delineated the
relationship of the Hoover to the
University and effectively shut
out Stanford faculty — respon
sible for governing the scholastic
and educational work of the Uni
versity — from any decision
making process or advisory role
regarding the institution. It stip
ulated that the director must be a
man who "reflects the purposes
of the institution" and gave the
institution's founder, Herbert
Hoover, strong control over the
choice of that man. It also
allowed the director great
freedom in managing the institu
tion.
Paragraph 3 states: "The
Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an inde
pendent institution within the
frame of Stanford University. Its
relation to the university is that

the president of the university will
propose all appointments, pro
motions and the budget of the in
stitution directly to the Board of
Trustees. There will be no refer
ence to any faculty committees
between the president and the
trustees."
Loud protest over the mission
of the institution, however, as
stated by Herbert Hoover and in
corporated into the charter, over
shadowed the governance issue.
Hoover wrote: "The purpose
of this institution must be, by its
research and publications, to
demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx —
whether Communism, Socialism,
economic materialism or atheism
— thus to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies,
their conspiracies, and to reaffirm
the validity of the American sys
tem."
Once published in The Daily,
Hoover's words provoked a
strong campus reaction.
The faculty formed an ad hoc
committee to draw up a statement
of academic freedom for the insti
tution, which was submitted to
the Board of Trustees with the re
quest that it replace Herbert
Hoover's statement. The trustees
acknowledged receipt of the com
mittee's document but took no
further action, according to Prof.
David Nivision, then associate
professor of Chinese and philoso
phy and a member of that faculty
committee.
A March 29, 1960 Daily edito
rial accompanying the full text of
Hoover's statement said: "We . . .
sincerely regret Mr. Hoover's
recent statement tying the goals
of the Hoover Institution to the

'purposes of the American
people' and the exposure of 'the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx . . ,' a statement which
flagrantly violates all the prin
ciples of scholarly investigation
and academic freedom."
Comments by professors pub
lished in The Daily April 3 and 4
echoed the regret and also
brought up the issue of gover
nance.
"The statement of Mr. Hoover
is incompatible with the univer
sity which is dedicated to the
freedom of the scholar and re
search for truth," wrote John
Johnston, professor of history.
Physics Prof. Sidney Drell

wrote: "It is alien to the discipline
in which I work to start with a
conclusion. The goal of research
and study is to describe events
and formulate and test hypothe
ses. If, in contrast, however, the
Hoover Institution has the
'purpose' as described in The
Daily, then I regret it."
Other professors worried more
that access to Hoovers archives
would be based on a researcher's
beliefs.
"The recent developments con
cerning the Hoover Institution
disturb me," wrote Physics Prof.
George Pake. "There have been
steps to remove the Hoover Insti
tution and its collection (which is
a priceless tool for research) from
normal cognizance of the faculty
which is, after all, the fountain
head of scholarship in the univer
sity."
Newly appointed Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell,
handpicked by Herbert Hoover,
said in a March 29, 1960 inter
view with The Daily that he was
aware of the faculty's alarm over
Hoover's statement.
"I see nothing wrong with it
(the statement), do you?" he
asked. To suggestions that such a
policy might violate true scholar
ship and result in predetermined
orientation of publications, he
replied: "There are evils in Mar
xism, and I hope we expose
them."
Campbell also indicated, ac
cording to the Daily article, that
while he hopes to maintain pleas
ant relations with the faculty and
faculty members were free to use
the Hoover's library facilities, he
was the one responsible for devel
oping and executing the research
program of the institution.

This lack of faculty oversight
to check the director's
powers lies at the heart of
the 25-year-old dispilte over
governance.
Exclusion of the faculty from
the process of appointing the in
stitution's staff and senior fellows
was especially irksome, and revi
sions in the Hoover/Stanford re
lationship centered on the ap
pointment procedure.
The faculty would like the
Hoover's selection process to be
as close as possible to the faculty's
process, according to University
News Service Director Bob
Beyers, who has reported on the
institution for about 20 years.
"How a person is selected is as
important as who is selected," he
said, explaining that the chief
source of discontent is not the
quality or type of people who are
senior fellows, but the manner in
which those people becomc
senior fellows.
This continual discontent
surfaced intermittently over the
years, and several changes in the
Hoover's appointment process
were made. External protests,
however, had litte influence in
bringing about these revisions,
according to Beyers. Negotiations
between the Hoover staff and
University administrators were
the instruments of change.
"Protesters often want immedi
ate change, but that usually does
not happen. There aren't any
quick changes and things change
through committess," Beyers
said. "The governance issue is
just going to grind on."

Ward and Dornbusch committees

Hoover governance and appointment procedures — another manifestation of concern that has existed since
1960.
are important over the long term,
according to Beyers, because they
are guidelines for future revisions
and discussions regarding the
Hoover/Stanford relationship.
The first major revision to the
appointment procedures came in
1969 when then-University Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer and
Campbell announced that they
had worked out a new system for
recommending and reviewing
major staff appointments in the
administrative, library and re
search divisions of the institution.
The system allowed for some
faculty input, but not in the selec
tion of senior fellows, the institu
tion's highest-ranking scholars
and its most visible members.
Faculty representatives, chosen
by the institution's director,
would serve on ad hoc search
committtees for the selection of
senior staff, curators and
librarians. The system allowed
the option of not appointing a
search committee in cases where
the position dealt with the
Hoover's internal administration
and not with its external relation
ships and interactions with the
University.
Appointments or promotions
to the status of senior fellows
would be recommended to the
president by the director after
consultation with the current
senior fellows.
In 1978, the appointment
process for senior fellows under
went a key revision — the faculty
were included.
Then-University President
Richard Lyman stated: "As part
of my review of future appoint
ments, I would expect... to con
stitute for each one an ad hoc
committee consisting of Stanford
faculty. This group will read the
appointment papers and . . .
advise me."
In practice, however, commit
tees were rarely formed and, ac
cording to the Dornbusch report,
"the review procedures have
been informal, even casual."
None of the Hoover's recom
mendations for its senior fellows
have ever been refused, according
to Beyers.
The most recent change in the
appointment procedure — an
nounced at the April 3 Faculty
Senate meeting — formalized the
1978 agreement and is, according
to Beyers, "a strengthening of the
president's review process."
What happened to the con
troversy over Hoover's
political orientation that
flared so intensely in 1960?
Waxing and waning but never
quite disappearing, the contro
versy is a recurring one that deals
with a slippery and sensitive issue.
"How do you quantify some
thing like political bias?" asked
David Nivison, currently acting
chairman of the Department of
Asian Languages. "Some things
said about (Hoover's political ori
entation) are true. Others are not
true. Still others cannot be
evaluated."
Nivison believes that a detailed
study of Hoover publications and
the independent reviews of those
books — which no one has yet at
tempted — would help to clear up
the question of whether or not the
institution has a bias.
To a certain extent the par
tisanship issue died after 1960.
Numerous protests directed at
the Hoover in the late '60s and
early '70s were more a result of
the anti-Vietnam War atmos
phere than any particular actions
of the institution, according to
Beyers. It was a time of protest
and for many, the Hoover — with
its scholars' research and its foun
der's statement of purpose — was
an obvious target.
A particularly loud outburst in
the running controversy over the
Hoover's mission arose in 1983.
This time the furor was touched
off by the institution's 1982 an
nual report, which boasted that
more than three dozen Hoover
fellows held or had held positions
in the administration of President
Reagan, himself a Hoover
honorary fellow.
In response, English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz and Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley began a
petition drive to protest "the exis
tence of a partisan organization"
within the University.
That campaign registered the
most support in recent memory for
charges of political partisanship,
with 1,500 students and 84 fac
ulty members signing a petition
presented to University President
Donald Kennedy.
But even at that time, the fac
ulty was more concerned about
matters of governance. On May
26, less than two weeks after
Kennedy received the petitions,
the Faculty Senate voted over
whelmingly in favor of a trustee
committee to "explore and
reassess the relations between the
Hoover Institution and the Uni
versity, including governance and
appointment procedures, with the
goal of promoting more effective
and cooperative relations."
One of the death knells for the
partisanship charge sounded in
1985 when the Faculty Senate
voted 29-1 to endorse the
Dornbusch report, which, among
other things, found "more politi
cal diversity at Hoover than the
stereotype allows for."
During the 1983 campus con
troversy, Hoover Senior Fellow
Seymour Martin Lipset polled the
25 senior fellows then at Hoover
and said he counted I 1 Demo
crats, 10 Republicans, three poli
tical independents and one
foreign national. Joseph Pech
man, a Hoover visiting scholar
last year, was one of Walter
Mondale's top advisers in the
1984 presidential campaign, ac
cording to Economics Prof. John
Shoven.
In addition, the Dornbusch
report continues, "No current
practice at Hoover appears to im
peril the free expression of ideas
by its members.' 1

Hoover Associate Director
John Cogan said that Hoover
scholars are "totally free to work
on whatever they want." The
think tank does not have a cen
trally directed research "agenda"
that dictates what its fellows must
study, Cogan said, and a scholar
need not submit his or her ideas
for peer review in order to receive
research funding.

'How do you quantify something like
political bias? Some things said about
(Hoovers political orientation) are
true. Others are not true. Still others
cannot be evaluated.'
— David Nivison, acting chairman of
the Asian Languages Department

If so, why does the partisanship
issue refuse to leave?
One reason for the lingering
charges of political bias may be
the history of Hoover's develop
ment, according to Nivison, who
has been a member of the Stan
ford faculty since 1948 and was
once briefly on the staff of
Hoover while it was still simply a
library.
The institution grew out of a
$50,000 grant in 1919 from Her
bert Hoover, Stanford's most fa-

mous alumnus, for the collection
of historical documents in Europe
for the Stanford University Li
brary. By 1921 nearly 30,000
items were in the Hoover War
Collection and Hoover had
donated an additional $100,000.
The collection soon became the
Hoover War Library, and in 1941
Hoover Tower was dedicated by
former President Herbert
Hoover, who had spearheaded a
fund-raising drive for the con
struction of the new facility.
On Sept. 19, 1946, the Board
of Trustees, with the approval of
Hoover, gave the library a new

name and adopted a plan for its
governance. The Hoover Institute
and Library on War, Revolution
and Peace was to be organized as
a separate division of the Univer
sity and its director was to func
tion as a department head and
report directly to the president.
At that time, the Hoover was
solely a library. In 1959 Stan
ford's trustees effectively gave the
library license to develop into a
research institution when it
replaced the 1946 plan with the
legal charter of the Hoover Insti
tution on War, Revolution and
Peace.
The transformation of the
Hoover began in 1960 with the
appointment of W. Glenn
Campbell, a man handpicked by
Herbert Hoover for "reflect(ing)
the purposes of the institution" as
stated in the Hoovers charter. As
director, Campbell had the inde
pendence and the power to
develop the institution as he saw
fit.
Along with Campbell's ap

pointment came Hoovers explicit
statement that the institution's
purpose is to expose the evils of
Marxism and preserve the Ameri
can way.
The natural inference from
these circumstances is that the li
brary's metamorphosis into a
powerful think tank is a result of
that mission, according to Nivi
sion, who noted that the inference
is not logical.
The charges of partisanship are
also sustained by appearances.
Not only is there Hoover's anti-

Communist statement and
Campbell's public agreement
with it, there is the Hoover's
pride in its political influence
which, while not "de facto
evidence of institutional partisan
ship, . . . has sometimes been so
blatantly expressed as to stim
ulate antagonism on campus," ac
cording to the Dornbusch report.
Rebholz, writing in Campus
Report in the spring of 1983, said
the 1982 Hoover annual report
"looks like it might have been
published by the Republican Na

tional Committee." That docu
ment contains pictures of a half
dozen Reagan Administration
figures and five pictures of the
President.
The 1985 annual report
features six photos of Reagan and
four of nationally prominent
Republicans, but none of well
known Democrats, except for the
single picture of University Presi
dent Kennedy.
Also, as the Ward report notes,
"It is probably true that the mem
bers of Stanford's social science

faculty are on the average more
'liberal' than their counterparts at
Hoover."
Beyers thinks one of the prob
lems is the institution's shortcom
ings in public relations.
The national media, he said,
gives much publicity to Hoover
fellows in the Reagan Adminis
tration, but Hoover neglects to
publicize its other scholars.
"Hoover does not do all it
could to reflect the diversity of
the views of its senior fellows,"
Beyers said. ■
