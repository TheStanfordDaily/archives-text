# Who will succeed Campbell?
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
W. Glenn Campbell, who oc
cupies the 11th floor of Hoover
Tower, has the highest office on
campus.
Some observers say that as
director of the Hoover Institu
tion he also holds one of the
most powerful administrative
positions in the University.
"The powers of the (Hoover)
director are far greater than
those of any department chair or
dean," says the Dornbusch
Report, released last year by a
faculty senate committee.
"The director controls the
budget, with some advice from
the (Hoover) Board of Over
seers. The director does not
report directly to the provost,
the chief academic officer of the
University; and presidents have
almost never exercised their au
thority over Hoover affairs."
Who should hold that power?
With Campbell turning 62 at the
end of the month, the answer
will come sooner rather than
later.
Campbell, who was born in
Ontario, Canada, on April 29,
1924, received his Ph.D in eco
nomics from Harvard in 1948.
He taught at Harvard for five
years, quitting to become an

economist for the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce. In 1954, he
became the research director of
the American Enterprise In
stitute for Public Policy Re
search in Washington, D.C., a
post he held until becoming
Hoover director in 1960.

He currently serves President
Reagan as chairman of the
three-member Intelligence
Oversight Board, which advises
the president on the legality and

propriety of intelligence activi
ties.
How soon will Campbell step
down?
The 1959 charter that con
verted Hoover from a library
into a think tank says a candi
date for director "should be of
an age which gives him a sub
stantial period of service before
the retirement age of 65 years."
Campbell said that does not
bind him to retire at 65. Legal
experts have told him he could
remain at least until he is 70, he
said.
"I don't know how long I
want to stay," he said, adding
that his duration depends on the
situation at Stanford and on the
attractiveness of other alterna
tives. Other alternatives,
Campbell said, would be "public
service, naturally."
Campus controversy keeps
convincing Campbell to remain.
"Everytime I think about
(retiring), there's some new at
tack on the Hoover Institution,
and I get re-invigorated and for
get all about it."
On the matter of appointing a
successor, it appears that rules
established in 1971 will be fol
lowed, despite the suggestion of
the Dornbusch Report that the
procedure be revised.
In fact, the committee that

will select candidates for the
next Hoover director has
already been formed.
The members of that commit
tee now include Hoover senior
fellows Martin Anderson,
Gerald Dorfman and Thomas
Sowell; Hoover Board of Over
seers members Dean Watkins
and Paul Davies; Stanford
Provost James Rosse; Emeritus
Law Prof. Charles Meyers; and
Emeritus Graduate School of
Business Prof. George Bach.
Bach is also an economics pro
fessor.
One member from the Board
of Overseers remains to be ap
pointed.
The committee will select
nominees, which will be for
warded to the University presi
dent. The president will select
one candidate, who must then
be approved by both the Hoover
Board of Overseers and the
Board of Trustees of the Her
bert Hoover Foundation in New
York City.
After acceptance by these
bodies, the candidate must be
approved by the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
After Campbell's successor is
appointed, University President
Donald Kennedy said he "just
doesn't know" if a new proce
dure will be adopted.
