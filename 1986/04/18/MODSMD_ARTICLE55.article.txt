### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
The author of a book on the history of U.S.
public policy research institutions said that
while individual scholars in the Hoover Insti
tution have ties to the Reagan Administra
tion, he does not perceive that the institution
as a whole has a narrow political mission.
But, he said, "if the major political institu
tions had to be arranged on a political spec
trum, certainly Hoover would fall to the right
of center."
Smith also drew parallels between the
Brookings Institute's role in the administra
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the early
'30s and Hoover's relationship to the Reagan
Administration.
James Smith, an American historian with
the 20th Century Fund, said most of the large
public policy institutions in America demon
strate some diversity in the ideological bent of
their scholars. He included the Hoover Insti
tution among the institutions which exhibit
ideological heterogeneity.
The 20th Century Fund is public policy re
search institution based in New York City.
The historian said he has noticed two major
determinants of an institution's political per
sonality. These he described as the tendency
of major research institutions to shift with the
political tides of the country and the demon
strated fear of think tanks to stray too far from
the political center.
For instance, Smith said that Brookings, the
American Enterprise Institute and Heritage

have all "drifted more toward the center" in
recent years.
"At the Heritage Foundation, you now
have a fair collection of neo-conservatives,"
Smith said.
Hoover is further diverse in that a mixture
of applied policy research, basic social science
and even humanities research is performed
there, Smith said.
He agreed, however, that it would be a "fair
generalization" to say that the social science
research done at Hoover, as well as the work
done by Hoover humanities scholars, is con
sistent with and supportive of certain assump
tions characteristic of the institution as a
whole.
For example, the nature of the work of phi
losopher and Senior Research Fellow Sidney
Hook is indicated in the praise of President
Reagan for his "commitment to rational
thought" and for his warning to the intellec
tual world of its "moral obligations ... in the
struggle between freedom and
totalitarianism."
Another Hoover philosopher, Senior Re
search Fellow Eric Voegelin, was praised for
having "done more than any other philoso
pher ... to bring an empirical, reasoned con
ception of the individual consciousness as the
dynamo of history."
Smith agreed that such philosophical views
would accommodate a political ideology
stressing empiricism, individualism, free en
terprise and the containment of communism.
Smith said that during the early '30s, the
chairman of the Brookings Institute was

Roosevelt's uncle. Smith said that, similarly,
"there is no doubt that there are people at
Hoover who are close associates of Ronald
Reagan."
As examples, Smith mentioned Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell and Senior Fel
low Martin Anderson, who "has been close to
Reagan since '76 . . . and Nixon since "68."
Reagan appointed Campbell and Anderson as
chairman and secretary, respectively, of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation,
which will oversee the funding and construc
tion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary on the Stanford campus.
While Smith said there were direct ties be
tween the Hoover Institution and the Reagan
Administration, he was unwilling to comment
as to whether such partisanship could be
damaging to Stanford University as an aca
demic institution.
"The faculty at Stanford would be a better
judge of that than I, he said. "I don t want to
offer a judgment from outside."
The major differences between Hoover and
Brookings, Smith said, are the same differ
ences that distinguish Hoover from most other
large, applied policy research institutions: lo
cation on a university campus, excellent
working conditions and relative removal from
Washington, D.C.
Another distinction that Smith made be
tween Hoover and other think tanks were
Hoover's "enviable" working conditions.
He said the conditions are good because of
the institution's close proximity to an excel-
