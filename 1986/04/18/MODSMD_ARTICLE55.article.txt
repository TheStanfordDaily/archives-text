### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
The author of a book on the history of U.S.
public policy research institutions said that
while individual scholars in the Hoover Insti
tution have ties to the Reagan Administra
tion, he does not perceive that the institution
as a whole has a narrow political mission.
But, he said, "if the major political institu
tions had to be arranged on a political spec
trum, certainly Hoover would fall to the right
of center."
Smith also drew parallels between the
Brookings Institute's role in the administra
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the early
'30s and Hoover's relationship to the Reagan
Administration.
James Smith, an American historian with
the 20th Century Fund, said most of the large
public policy institutions in America demon
strate some diversity in the ideological bent of
their scholars. He included the Hoover Insti
tution among the institutions which exhibit
ideological heterogeneity.
The 20th Century Fund is public policy re
search institution based in New York City.
The historian said he has noticed two major
determinants of an institution's political per
sonality. These he described as the tendency
of major research institutions to shift with the
political tides of the country and the demon
strated fear of think tanks to stray too far from
the political center.
For instance, Smith said that Brookings, the
American Enterprise Institute and Heritage

have all "drifted more toward the center" in
recent years.
"At the Heritage Foundation, you now
have a fair collection of neo-conservatives,"
Smith said.
Hoover is further diverse in that a mixture
of applied policy research, basic social science
and even humanities research is performed
there, Smith said.
He agreed, however, that it would be a "fair
generalization" to say that the social science
research done at Hoover, as well as the work
done by Hoover humanities scholars, is con
sistent with and supportive of certain assump
tions characteristic of the institution as a
whole.
For example, the nature of the work of phi
losopher and Senior Research Fellow Sidney
Hook is indicated in the praise of President
Reagan for his "commitment to rational
thought" and for his warning to the intellec
tual world of its "moral obligations ... in the
struggle between freedom and
totalitarianism."
Another Hoover philosopher, Senior Re
search Fellow Eric Voegelin, was praised for
having "done more than any other philoso
pher ... to bring an empirical, reasoned con
ception of the individual consciousness as the
dynamo of history."
Smith agreed that such philosophical views
would accommodate a political ideology
stressing empiricism, individualism, free en
terprise and the containment of communism.
Smith said that during the early '30s, the
chairman of the Brookings Institute was

Roosevelt's uncle. Smith said that, similarly,
"there is no doubt that there are people at
Hoover who are close associates of Ronald
Reagan."
As examples, Smith mentioned Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell and Senior Fel
low Martin Anderson, who "has been close to
Reagan since '76 . . . and Nixon since "68."
Reagan appointed Campbell and Anderson as
chairman and secretary, respectively, of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation,
which will oversee the funding and construc
tion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary on the Stanford campus.
While Smith said there were direct ties be
tween the Hoover Institution and the Reagan
Administration, he was unwilling to comment
as to whether such partisanship could be
damaging to Stanford University as an aca
demic institution.
"The faculty at Stanford would be a better
judge of that than I, he said. "I don t want to
offer a judgment from outside."
The major differences between Hoover and
Brookings, Smith said, are the same differ
ences that distinguish Hoover from most other
large, applied policy research institutions: lo
cation on a university campus, excellent
working conditions and relative removal from
Washington, D.C.
Another distinction that Smith made be
tween Hoover and other think tanks were
Hoover's "enviable" working conditions.
He said the conditions are good because of
the institution's close proximity to an excel-
lent archive and library and be
cause Hoover fellows are free of
almost all administrative and
teaching responsibilities.
"Compared with Rand or the
Urban Institute, where you're
frequently hustling for the next
contract, the next grant, which is
very burdensome both psyc
hologically and in terms of time,
for Hoover people to be freed of
those responsibilities puts them in
a very enviable position," he said.
Smith said there are " 1,100 or
1,200 research institutions that
may have a bearing on public
policy issues" in the United
States, but that only 150 to 200 of
these are all or partially devoted
to applied policy research. Of
these 150 to 200 institutions in
volved in applied policy research,
only 25 to 30 have budgets of
more than $ 1 million.
The Hoover Institution, with
an annual budget in '85-'B6 of
$12 million, is one of these. It is
the only one of them, Smith said,
situated on the campus of a major
university. Other institutions in
the group include the American
Enterprise Institute, the Brook
ings Institute, the Heritage Foun
dation, the Policy Research Insti
tution, the Russel-Sage Founda
tion, the Rand Corporation and
the Urban Institute.
Policy research institutions
have been in existence since the
beginning of the century, Smith
said. They were originally non
ideological entities founded on
"the perhaps naive view that
there could be objective social
scientists. It was thought they
could collect the facts and not
bring in any opinions."
The existence of these non
partisan institutions was accom
panied by a lower level of ex
pertise in the executive branch
and Congress than exists today.
Congressional and executive
staffs were small, and accord
ingly, he said, public policy insti
tutions had a more important role
in government and were
sometimes called upon to help
draft legislation. Smith men
tioned two important bills passed
before 1920 that were drafted by
people at the Brookings Institute.
Today, many policy research
institutions are becoming more
ideological while at the same time
enjoying less direct input into the
formation of public policy. Smith
said. There has been a long-term
increase in "the combination of
research and political advocacy,"
he said, as a growth in govern
ment expertise has resulted in a
decrease in government reliance
on public policy scholars.
"In the 1980s," he said, "you
don't see institutions being called
upon to do the explicit tasks of
bill-writing, planning and re
search for government."
Thus the influence of public
policy research institutions has
become "more diffuse," said
Smith. Rather than directly in
fluencing government, public
policy institutions now have the
role of informing elite opinion.
"They inform the intelligent and
politically informed public,"
Smith said.
Smith added that although the
effect of the institutions as a
whole is now limited to the in
forming of elite opinion, individ
uals within such institutions can
nevertheless have a direct effect
on policy decisions if appointed to
an official or advisory role in gov
ernment. "This is not to say that
individuals might not be called

upon to help with the policy
making process," he said.
In a qualification of his state
ment that public policy research
institutions are becoming more
ideological by combining research
and advocacy, Smith added that
American discourse on public
policy matters is nevertheless
traditionally very pragmatic and
that, in line with this tradition, the
"universe of political research in
stitutions has tended to act as a
center of gravity pulling political
discussion toward the center. . . .

The pragmatic tradition of dis
course in the long run tends to
narrow extremes of discussion."
Financially, Hoover's '85-'B6
budget of $12 million "puts it
right in the same category as the
Heritage Foundation, Brookings
and the American Enterprise In
stitute, all of which have budgets
of $11 to $13 million," Smith
said.
He noted that the institution
with the largest budget is the
Rand Corporation, which has a
$60 million budget, with $20 mil

lion devoted to domestic re
search.
""At Hoover, 41 percent of '85-
'86 revenues came from individ
ual, foundation and corporate
gifts. Twenty-seven percent of
Hoover's revenues derive from
University funds.
Smith said that a correlation
between members of an institu
tion's Board of Overseers and its
main contributors is common at
institutions like Hoover.
"Starting in the 19705, corpo

rations and conservative founda
tions became much more inter
ested in participating in the battle
of ideas," he said. "The big cor
porations try to bolster the idea of
a free market, of free enterprise."
Twenty-eight of the 74 members
of the Hoover Board of Over
seers are corporate chairmen.
The Board of Overseers must ap
prove any new director of the
Hoover Institution.
He has almost completed his
study, which will be published as
a book sometime in 1987. â–

those responsibilities puts them in
a very enviable position," he said.
Smith said there are " 1,100 or
1,200 research institutions that
may have a bearing on public
policy issues" in the United
States, but that only 150 to 200 of
these are all or partially devoted
to applied policy research. Of
these 150 to 200 institutions in
volved in applied policy research,
only 25 to 30 have budgets of
more than $ 1 million.
The Hoover Institution, with
an annual budget in '85-'B6 of
$12 million, is one of these. It is
the only one of them, Smith said,
situated on the campus of a major
university. Other institutions in
the group include the American
Enterprise Institute, the Brook
ings Institute, the Heritage Foun
dation, the Policy Research Insti
tution, the Russel-Sage Founda
tion, the Rand Corporation and
the Urban Institute.
Policy research institutions
have been in existence since the
beginning of the century, Smith
said. They were originally non
ideological entities founded on
"the perhaps naive view that
there could be objective social
scientists. It was thought they
could collect the facts and not
bring in any opinions."
The existence of these non
partisan institutions was accom
panied by a lower level of ex
pertise in the executive branch
and Congress than exists today.
Congressional and executive
staffs were small, and accord
ingly, he said, public policy insti
tutions had a more important role
in government and were
sometimes called upon to help
draft legislation. Smith men
tioned two important bills passed
before 1920 that were drafted by
people at the Brookings Institute.
Today, many policy research
institutions are becoming more
ideological while at the same time
enjoying less direct input into the
formation of public policy. Smith
said. There has been a long-term
increase in "the combination of
research and political advocacy,"
he said, as a growth in govern
ment expertise has resulted in a
decrease in government reliance
on public policy scholars.
"In the 1980s," he said, "you
don't see institutions being called
upon to do the explicit tasks of
bill-writing, planning and re
search for government."
Thus the influence of public
policy research institutions has
become "more diffuse," said
Smith. Rather than directly in
fluencing government, public
policy institutions now have the
role of informing elite opinion.
"They inform the intelligent and
politically informed public,"
Smith said.
Smith added that although the
effect of the institutions as a
whole is now limited to the in
forming of elite opinion, individ
uals within such institutions can
nevertheless have a direct effect
on policy decisions if appointed to
an official or advisory role in gov
ernment. "This is not to say that
individuals might not be called

upon to help with the policy
making process," he said.
In a qualification of his state
ment that public policy research
institutions are becoming more
ideological by combining research
and advocacy, Smith added that
American discourse on public
policy matters is nevertheless
traditionally very pragmatic and
that, in line with this tradition, the
"universe of political research in
stitutions has tended to act as a
center of gravity pulling political
discussion toward the center. . . .

The pragmatic tradition of dis
course in the long run tends to
narrow extremes of discussion."
Financially, Hoover's '85-'B6
budget of $12 million "puts it
right in the same category as the
Heritage Foundation, Brookings
and the American Enterprise In
stitute, all of which have budgets
of $11 to $13 million," Smith
said.
He noted that the institution
with the largest budget is the
Rand Corporation, which has a
$60 million budget, with $20 mil

lion devoted to domestic re
search.
""At Hoover, 41 percent of '85-
'86 revenues came from individ
ual, foundation and corporate
gifts. Twenty-seven percent of
Hoover's revenues derive from
University funds.
Smith said that a correlation
between members of an institu
tion's Board of Overseers and its
main contributors is common at
institutions like Hoover.
"Starting in the 19705, corpo

rations and conservative founda
tions became much more inter
ested in participating in the battle
of ideas," he said. "The big cor
porations try to bolster the idea of
a free market, of free enterprise."
Twenty-eight of the 74 members
of the Hoover Board of Over
seers are corporate chairmen.
The Board of Overseers must ap
prove any new director of the
Hoover Institution.
He has almost completed his
study, which will be published as
a book sometime in 1987. â– 
The author of a book on the history of U.S.
public policy research institutions said that
while individual scholars in the Hoover Insti
tution have ties to the Reagan Administra
tion, he does not perceive that the institution
as a whole has a narrow political mission.
But, he said, "if the major political institu
tions had to be arranged on a political spec
trum, certainly Hoover would fall to the right
of center."
Smith also drew parallels between the
Brookings Institute's role in the administra
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the early
'30s and Hoover's relationship to the Reagan
Administration.
James Smith, an American historian with
the 20th Century Fund, said most of the large
public policy institutions in America demon
strate some diversity in the ideological bent of
their scholars. He included the Hoover Insti
tution among the institutions which exhibit
ideological heterogeneity.
The 20th Century Fund is public policy re
search institution based in New York City.
The historian said he has noticed two major
determinants of an institution's political per
sonality. These he described as the tendency
of major research institutions to shift with the
political tides of the country and the demon
strated fear of think tanks to stray too far from
the political center.
For instance, Smith said that Brookings, the
American Enterprise Institute and Heritage

have all "drifted more toward the center" in
recent years.
"At the Heritage Foundation, you now
have a fair collection of neo-conservatives,"
Smith said.
Hoover is further diverse in that a mixture
of applied policy research, basic social science
and even humanities research is performed
there, Smith said.
He agreed, however, that it would be a "fair
generalization" to say that the social science
research done at Hoover, as well as the work
done by Hoover humanities scholars, is con
sistent with and supportive of certain assump
tions characteristic of the institution as a
whole.
For example, the nature of the work of phi
losopher and Senior Research Fellow Sidney
Hook is indicated in the praise of President
Reagan for his "commitment to rational
thought" and for his warning to the intellec
tual world of its "moral obligations ... in the
struggle between freedom and
totalitarianism."
Another Hoover philosopher, Senior Re
search Fellow Eric Voegelin, was praised for
having "done more than any other philoso
pher ... to bring an empirical, reasoned con
ception of the individual consciousness as the
dynamo of history."
Smith agreed that such philosophical views
would accommodate a political ideology
stressing empiricism, individualism, free en
terprise and the containment of communism.
Smith said that during the early '30s, the
chairman of the Brookings Institute was

Roosevelt's uncle. Smith said that, similarly,
"there is no doubt that there are people at
Hoover who are close associates of Ronald
Reagan."
As examples, Smith mentioned Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell and Senior Fel
low Martin Anderson, who "has been close to
Reagan since '76 . . . and Nixon since "68."
Reagan appointed Campbell and Anderson as
chairman and secretary, respectively, of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation,
which will oversee the funding and construc
tion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary on the Stanford campus.
While Smith said there were direct ties be
tween the Hoover Institution and the Reagan
Administration, he was unwilling to comment
as to whether such partisanship could be
damaging to Stanford University as an aca
demic institution.
"The faculty at Stanford would be a better
judge of that than I, he said. "I don t want to
offer a judgment from outside."
The major differences between Hoover and
Brookings, Smith said, are the same differ
ences that distinguish Hoover from most other
large, applied policy research institutions: lo
cation on a university campus, excellent
working conditions and relative removal from
Washington, D.C.
Another distinction that Smith made be
tween Hoover and other think tanks were
Hoover's "enviable" working conditions.
He said the conditions are good because of
the institution's close proximity to an excel-
lent archive and library and be
cause Hoover fellows are free of
almost all administrative and
teaching responsibilities.
"Compared with Rand or the
Urban Institute, where you're
frequently hustling for the next
contract, the next grant, which is
very burdensome both psyc
hologically and in terms of time,
for Hoover people to be freed of
those responsibilities puts them in
a very enviable position," he said.
Smith said there are " 1,100 or
1,200 research institutions that
may have a bearing on public
policy issues" in the United
States, but that only 150 to 200 of

"Starting in the 19705, corpo

The author of a book on the history of U.S.
public policy research institutions said that
while individual scholars in the Hoover Insti
tution have ties to the Reagan Administra
tion, he does not perceive that the institution
as a whole has a narrow political mission.
But, he said, "if the major political institu
tions had to be arranged on a political spec
trum, certainly Hoover would fall to the right
of center."
Smith also drew parallels between the
Brookings Institute's role in the administra
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the early
'30s and Hoover's relationship to the Reagan
Administration.
James Smith, an American historian with
the 20th Century Fund, said most of the large
public policy institutions in America demon
strate some diversity in the ideological bent of
their scholars. He included the Hoover Insti
tution among the institutions which exhibit
ideological heterogeneity.
The 20th Century Fund is public policy re
search institution based in New York City.
The historian said he has noticed two major
determinants of an institution's political per
sonality. These he described as the tendency
of major research institutions to shift with the
political tides of the country and the demon
strated fear of think tanks to stray too far from
the political center.
For instance, Smith said that Brookings, the
American Enterprise Institute and Heritage

have all "drifted more toward the center" in
recent years.
"At the Heritage Foundation, you now
have a fair collection of neo-conservatives,"
Smith said.
Hoover is further diverse in that a mixture
of applied policy research, basic social science
and even humanities research is performed
there, Smith said.
He agreed, however, that it would be a "fair
generalization" to say that the social science
research done at Hoover, as well as the work
done by Hoover humanities scholars, is con
sistent with and supportive of certain assump
tions characteristic of the institution as a
whole.
For example, the nature of the work of phi
losopher and Senior Research Fellow Sidney
Hook is indicated in the praise of President
Reagan for his "commitment to rational
thought" and for his warning to the intellec
tual world of its "moral obligations ... in the
struggle between freedom and
totalitarianism."
Another Hoover philosopher, Senior Re
search Fellow Eric Voegelin, was praised for
having "done more than any other philoso
pher ... to bring an empirical, reasoned con
ception of the individual consciousness as the
dynamo of history."
Smith agreed that such philosophical views
would accommodate a political ideology
stressing empiricism, individualism, free en
terprise and the containment of communism.
Smith said that during the early '30s, the
chairman of the Brookings Institute was

Roosevelt's uncle. Smith said that, similarly,
"there is no doubt that there are people at
Hoover who are close associates of Ronald
Reagan."
As examples, Smith mentioned Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell and Senior Fel
low Martin Anderson, who "has been close to
Reagan since '76 . . . and Nixon since "68."
Reagan appointed Campbell and Anderson as
chairman and secretary, respectively, of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation,
which will oversee the funding and construc
tion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary on the Stanford campus.
While Smith said there were direct ties be
tween the Hoover Institution and the Reagan
Administration, he was unwilling to comment
as to whether such partisanship could be
damaging to Stanford University as an aca
demic institution.
"The faculty at Stanford would be a better
judge of that than I, he said. "I don t want to
offer a judgment from outside."
The major differences between Hoover and
Brookings, Smith said, are the same differ
ences that distinguish Hoover from most other
large, applied policy research institutions: lo
cation on a university campus, excellent
working conditions and relative removal from
Washington, D.C.
Another distinction that Smith made be
tween Hoover and other think tanks were
Hoover's "enviable" working conditions.
He said the conditions are good because of
the institution's close proximity to an excel-
lent archive and library and be
cause Hoover fellows are free of
almost all administrative and
teaching responsibilities.
"Compared with Rand or the
Urban Institute, where you're
frequently hustling for the next
contract, the next grant, which is
very burdensome both psyc
hologically and in terms of time,
for Hoover people to be freed of
those responsibilities puts them in
a very enviable position," he said.
Smith said there are " 1,100 or
1,200 research institutions that
may have a bearing on public
policy issues" in the United
States, but that only 150 to 200 of
these are all or partially devoted
to applied policy research. Of
these 150 to 200 institutions in
volved in applied policy research,
only 25 to 30 have budgets of
more than $ 1 million.
The Hoover Institution, with
an annual budget in '85-'B6 of
$12 million, is one of these. It is
the only one of them, Smith said,
situated on the campus of a major
university. Other institutions in
the group include the American
Enterprise Institute, the Brook
ings Institute, the Heritage Foun
dation, the Policy Research Insti
tution, the Russel-Sage Founda
tion, the Rand Corporation and
the Urban Institute.
Policy research institutions
have been in existence since the
beginning of the century, Smith
said. They were originally non
ideological entities founded on
"the perhaps naive view that
there could be objective social
scientists. It was thought they
could collect the facts and not
bring in any opinions."
The existence of these non
partisan institutions was accom
panied by a lower level of ex
pertise in the executive branch
and Congress than exists today.
Congressional and executive
staffs were small, and accord
ingly, he said, public policy insti
tutions had a more important role
in government and were
sometimes called upon to help
draft legislation. Smith men
tioned two important bills passed
before 1920 that were drafted by
people at the Brookings Institute.
Today, many policy research
institutions are becoming more
ideological while at the same time
enjoying less direct input into the
formation of public policy. Smith
said. There has been a long-term
increase in "the combination of
research and political advocacy,"
he said, as a growth in govern
ment expertise has resulted in a
decrease in government reliance
on public policy scholars.
"In the 1980s," he said, "you
don't see institutions being called
upon to do the explicit tasks of
bill-writing, planning and re
search for government."
Thus the influence of public
policy research institutions has
become "more diffuse," said
Smith. Rather than directly in
fluencing government, public
policy institutions now have the
role of informing elite opinion.
"They inform the intelligent and
politically informed public,"
Smith said.
Smith added that although the
effect of the institutions as a
whole is now limited to the in
forming of elite opinion, individ
uals within such institutions can
nevertheless have a direct effect
on policy decisions if appointed to
an official or advisory role in gov
ernment. "This is not to say that
individuals might not be called

upon to help with the policy
making process," he said.
In a qualification of his state
ment that public policy research
institutions are becoming more
ideological by combining research
and advocacy, Smith added that
American discourse on public
policy matters is nevertheless
traditionally very pragmatic and
that, in line with this tradition, the
"universe of political research in
stitutions has tended to act as a
center of gravity pulling political
discussion toward the center. . . .

The pragmatic tradition of dis
course in the long run tends to
narrow extremes of discussion."
Financially, Hoover's '85-'B6
budget of $12 million "puts it
right in the same category as the
Heritage Foundation, Brookings
and the American Enterprise In
stitute, all of which have budgets
of $11 to $13 million," Smith
said.
He noted that the institution
with the largest budget is the
Rand Corporation, which has a
$60 million budget, with $20 mil

lion devoted to domestic re
search.
""At Hoover, 41 percent of '85-
'86 revenues came from individ
ual, foundation and corporate
gifts. Twenty-seven percent of
Hoover's revenues derive from
University funds.
Smith said that a correlation
between members of an institu
tion's Board of Overseers and its
main contributors is common at
institutions like Hoover.
"Starting in the 19705, corpo

rations and conservative founda
tions became much more inter
ested in participating in the battle
of ideas," he said. "The big cor
porations try to bolster the idea of
a free market, of free enterprise."
Twenty-eight of the 74 members
of the Hoover Board of Over
seers are corporate chairmen.
The Board of Overseers must ap
prove any new director of the
Hoover Institution.
