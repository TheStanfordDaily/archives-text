# Man & Telephone
## 
### Sarah L. Allen 
Sarah L. Allen is a senior, majoring
in electrical engineering and home
economics (self-designed). Her rather
avant-garde submission, "Man &
Telephone," is the selected piece of
short fiction for this issue of The Stan
ford Daily Magazine.
One story will appear in each issue,
and its author receives $50.

Men and telephones are
recurring themes in my
life. The telephone is not
a happy medium for me. Also, I
am twenty-five. The phone
reaches out and feels me up.
"Angelica," he says."I love
her."
"Good," 1 say. "Fine."
"Good?" he says. He is
confused. He is Lenny.
"Willow," I say. "Chastity," I
say. "And now Angelica." (Later
Bitsy!) These names, unlike Janet
or Sue, are names that I can cope
with.
"I love her. The place is so
clean you can eat off the floors."
"1 hate you." This is not yet
true.
"I loved you."
"Do you know," 1 say, "what I
dislike most about you?"
"My nazi wife? The arsenic in
the cat dish?"
I had forgotten about the ar
senic. I move to a new apartment.
Waiting for the elevator, I grope
with and marry the doorman,
only to discover we have nothing
in common save a love of good
luggage. I take my phone. I take
the cat who pees all over my
counter tops. I had forgotten
about the arsenic. Is it significant?
"Well, for one thing," I say,
"your nazi wife."
"Oh her."
"How is Maude?"
"Thanks for asking. Fine.
Fine." He is pleased, "for a
cadaver, she's got so much pres
ence. She's got a birthday coming
up. We'll have a get-together.
Nothing fancy. All the interns,
maybe some third-years. We're
still planning."

I say nothing.
"Now hey," he says. "Hey! It's
not like that!" Maude and
Lenny? Something to think
about.
"Bitsy understands me," he
says."I love her. No, I adore
her."
"Bitsy?" (Bitsy!) "Angelica?"
"Oh her. Honestly, what am I
going to do with you?"
"Things seem pretty clear," I
say. "Have I missed something?"
"Hey Babe (Babe?), you aren't
bitter are you? You sound a little,
oh I don't know, down. Wine. Do
you have any?"
"Yes."
"I haven't seen you since the
war. I'll put Maude back together
again and come right up." So he
comes to San Francisco, my
apartment. He opens the door
without knocking Typical!
"You didn't let me finish," I
say. "Yes I have some wine, but
you can't have any. You under
stand." He does, and throws the
cat out the window before return
ing to Pasadena, Bitsy, Angelica,
Maude, his phone.
"What is she like?" Bitsy. I am
a masochist.
"Aw don't," he says. "Don't."
I am even more curious. Bitsy. I
carry the phone into the bath
room. I take a shower. Lenny
joins me. We embrace
awkwardly.
"Out," I say. "Get out! I don't
want to see you." This is not en
tirely true.
" Aw." Lenny drips on the floor
and drop-kicks threat off the fire
escape. Honestly, what did I ever
see in him?
For years I think of Bitsy.

Lenny. Lenny and Bitsy.
Ramona, Angelica, Bitsy and
Lenny. "I'm curious," I say. Can
she be tall, ugly, and obese?
"Maybe," says Lenny. "Maybe
not." God, we had been good to
gether.
I doodle a picture of Bitsy. Per
fect. I ring the doorbell. Ramona,
the nazi wife, answers. "Oh, it's
you," she says.
"Likewise I'm sure," I say.
Ramona wears a regulation hel
met and T-shirt with a swastika
over each breast. This is all she
wears. In the kitchen, Angelica is
cleaning the oven.
I show Lenny my drawing of
Bitsy. It is a picture of a tiny in
consequential woman picking her
tiny nose. She is at Sea World sit
ting on a bag of popcorn.
"Perfect," says Lenny.
"Bitsy?" says Ramona. She
looks over Lenny's shoulder at
the scrap of toilet paper.
"Hmmph, not so great." Does
she mean Bitsy or my drawing?
"Both," says Lenny.
Angelica pulls her head out of
the oven. Though she wears knee
pads and a string bikini, I keep
forgetting what she looks like
from moment to moment. "May I
look?"
"No," says Lenny.
"You missed a spot," says
Ramona.
"Where?" asks Angelica.
Ramona unshoulders her rifle
and fires at the stove. "There,"
she says. " Right there."
"I'd love to chat," I say.
"Really, I would, but. . .
"Stay," says Lenny. "Listen,
we've got your cat in the oven,
wine chilling in the fridge, and

some friends dropping over.
Water under the bridge. Let's be
pals." Pals?
£££1 ome friends" turn out to
Maude and Bitsy.
Maude arrives in a
cardboard box, C.O.D.
"Figures," says Ramona.
Angelica unpacks Maude and
arranges her on the sofa. I like
Angelica, a tolerance of Lenny's
polygamous necrophilia being
just one of the things we have in
common. Bitsy is another matter.
She is exactly as I pictured her,
only much smaller. Years ago, I
had imagined Bitsy to be al
ternately tall and ugly and obese.
She is none of these things. She is
only small. She is dwarfed by her
accessories; hoop earrings and a
bracelet swing from her body like
hoola hoops. I nearly step on her
twice. Finally, Lenny insists she
put a bell around her neck. Ap
parently, this has happened
before.
We play charades. Lenny acts
out Caligula. Bitsy gets it after
Lenny indicates it is a word with
four syllables.
"Cheaters never win. Winners
never cheat," says Ramona.
"Actually ..." begins An
gelica.
Ramona levels her rifle at An
gelica. Angelica sits down next to
Maude on the sofa.
Bitsy ignores Ramona and
slides down Lenny's tie. At least
she does not say "wheee!"' I
remind Ramona that Bitsy did, in
fact, cheat and has, in part, won. I
am next. I act out The Sorrows of
Young Werther. I spend two
minutes miming 'sounds like —
borrow.' No one gets it. At the
end of three minutes, Ramona,
the time keeper, fires a gun into
the ceiling.
"Goethe," I say. "Ramona,
he's German. You, at least,
should have known."
"Yes," she says."l knew."
"It's been really super," I say.
This is not entirely true. "But I've
really got to get back." I go home
to San Francisco, the cat, my
phone.
"Hey hey," Lenny says, "ho
ho."
"Cut it out. But immediately.
Could we please wrap things up?"
My husband, the doorman, is
pounding on the bathroom door.
"Honey," says my husband,
"honey, you've been in there for
three years. Is everything OK?
What are you doing in there?"
"I'm on the phone," I say.
"Well, do you think maybe I
could use the toilet? Or maybe
could we consummate our mar
riage?"
"I am on the phone. I am also
on the pot. Could you give me a
little more time?"
"We need a fourth for bridge,"
says Lenny.
I go to him.
Bitsy, Angelica, and the nazi
are there. Maude?
"Gone," says Lenny. "We had
something real, but I'm an M.D.
now
Ramona takes my coat and sets
it on fire. She throws the flaming
tweed into the sink.
"Thanks," I say.
"Look here," she says. "Look
here you."
"One of these days ..." I say.
Angelica smothers the flames and
puts the coat out on the fire
escape to cool.
Bitsy shuffles the cards one at a
time. Almost gone, she sits on a
pin cushion on the the card table.
I set my drink on her. Bitsy
screams.
"Haven't you ever heard of
coasters?" asks the nazi.
(Ramona won't show nearly so
much concern for Bitsy's health
when sometime later she puts her
in the soup. Bitsy bouillon.)
"Hey," says Lenny. "Hey
hey!"
"An accident. It was an acci
dent," I say.
I win the game. Is this
significant? Lenny sits on the
couch reading Max Weber to his
two screwed-up sons (by
Ramona), Adolph and Mike.
Bitsy swings on my earring. She
tells me that Adolph flushes
toilets, all toilets, with his feet.
"It's not right," she says.
"Morally?" I ask.
"No, I mean he just doesn't use
his hands. Ever. For anything.
Wierd," she says. "W-I-E-R-D,"
she spells.
I agree. I'm bored. I leave. I
send Ramona a bill for my coat.
She sends back a note that says,
"What coat? Fuck you!"
"Lenny, she needs professional
care."
"Jesus, I know. I know. Last
year she put Bitsy in the soup.
What a mess. By the time Adolph
fished her out, Bitsy was a wreck.
Evidently she survived by clinging

to a carrot. Also, I just wanted to
let you know I think you're a
great girl. One of the greatest.
Really great."
"Thank you."
Silence (he is expecting
more?).
"But I'm not being fair to you
or Bitsy." There is a knock on my
door. It is Lenny.
"Just a minute," I say.
I leave my husband. We dicker.
"You take the carry-on bag
and the mid-size suitcase. I'll take
the suit-bag and the other mid
sized. Do you think you'll need
the cosmetics case? No? May I
take it then? Thank you, and
please take the portable dolly. No
hard feelings? No hard feelings.
Just one second, Lenny."
I move to Seattle. It is not easy.
We have trouble at the airport.
For one thing, the cat is not
happy. He is in a "Kitty-Carry-
All.'' It is beige and has a handle.
At one end there are holes. He
pees constantly, furiously.
"Don't shit in your own back
yard," I say.
Over the phone, Lenny says,
"Jesus God, that was really cute.
There I stood outside your door. I
had flowers. Did you know I had
flowers?"
"I knew," I say.
t's a bomb, or . . . well, it
I could be," says the airport
A security guard. He is point
ing to the telephone. He does not
question the status of the cat in
the reeking "Kitty-Carry-All."
."It is not," I say, "a bomb. It is
a telephone."
"Then put it through the x
ray."
"No, it is delicate. It is un
stable, this phone."
"Bra burner!"
I lift my shirt up. He is wrong.
"Let me talk to him," says
Lenny.
I give the receiver to the guard.
"Authoritarian asshole," says
Lenny. He is not helping. The
guard wrestles the phone away
from me and thrusts it onto the
moving conveyor belt. It disap
pears into the x-ray machine.
"Turn off the light!" screams
Bitsy, "I'm not wearing a slip."
The guard stares into the moni
tor. What does he see?
"Put Ramona on the phone," I
say. "Ramona, tell this man that
this is a phone. Please."
"Look here you. Look here,"
she says. "This is a goddamn tele
phone. A phone. Or it could be a
bomb. I know this woman."
The cat likes jail. I do not.
They take my phone. They
unscrew it and look at it.
"It is not," I say, "a bomb. It is
a telephone. You're wasting
you're time."
I use the payphone in the hall.
"I get one call, right?"
"Yes."
I call Lenny. Ramona answers.
"Oh it's you."
"Anti-Christ," I say, "may I
speak to Lenny?"
"He's bathing Bitsy."
"Angelica?"
"She's dusting and can't be dis
turbed."

The police woman is not
looking. I hang up and call my
mother.
"You!" she says. "Your phone
has been busy for years. Anyway
Baby (Babe?), you caught me at a
bad time. I'm busy.
"Busy?"
"I'm having a hot flash and
looking out the window."
I call my ex-husband, the door
man.
"I'm married," he says.
"Good," I say. "Fine."
While the police woman has
her back to me, I have a casual af
fair with an arsonist. We speak of
the significance of fire, jail
breaks, and marriage. I tell him I
am "in for" a telephone bomb.
He says he thinks that is a sexy
and feminine crime. I tell him I
am innocent. This too excites
him. I tell him it will never work,
he and I. They return my phone.
It looks different. Bigger. I take
the cat and leave.
During the flight, my mother
calls.
"Lenny called," she says.
"Oh?" I have never mentioned
him.

"He's worried about you."
"Honestly Mother, I have
never been better." This is not
entirely true but I seem to be
making progress.
"I've always liked him."
"Is that pot roast I smell,
Mother?"
What else did the police do to
the phone?
"Yes!" She is pleased. "You
like?"
"Well / certainly do," says
Lenny. Lenny?
"Hi hon," says Lenny. "How's

tricks?"
I disembark and settle into a
small house. It is near the Univer
sity of Washington. I enroll. I en
joy my classes and have many
good conversations in the student
union.
"My name is not 'hon.' "
"Well, well, well," says Lenny.
"You have always been just a
little snotty," says Mother.
"I've always thought that."
Bitsy! "Hi Mother, I'm Bitsy."
A party line. Does this mean at
some point I can be talking to
Lenny, Bitsy, and Ramona, in
Pasadena, and my Mother in
Reno?
"Yes," they say.
Oh.
"Bitsy, it is so nice to meet
you," says Mother, "Lenny has
told me so much about you."
"Mother, Bitsy is not exactly a
friend," I say.
"Rude. Rude" says mother.
"Mother. May I call you
Mother?" asks Ramona.
"Of course," says Mother.
"Certainly. This one here doesn't
call me for three years."
"I was on the phone," I say.

"I want the recipe for your pot
roast," says Ramona. "It smells
divine."
"I've got an idea," says
Mother. "Why don't you all come
down to my house for dinner? It's
on the table."
"Wheee!" says Bitsy.
"I could eat a cat," says
Ramona.
This is what I say. "One of
these days ..."
"That's super of you, Mother,"

says Lenny. "Angelica will
definitely do the dishes."
"Coming?" they ask.
I move to Kansas. 1 get a job. I
settle into a pattern of voluntary
celibacy. Both Kansas and
celibacy seem like a good idea at
the time.
"We're saving you some des
sert," says Mother.
"Thanks. But really, no."
"Rhubarb pie?" says Lenny.
"Your favorite."
"Actually, no," I say, "it isn't."
The cat meets a Toto-like
dog. I think he is in love.
"Love?" says Lenny. "The cat
doesn't know his ass from ar
sonic."
I understand that he is saying
something little and mean, but
I'm not sure what.
"Sure you don't want some cof
fee?" asks Mother.
Toto leave the cat. We travel to
forget. Australia. China. Home to
Seattle. Ramona, Bitsy, Angelica,
and Lenny are still at my
Mother's in Reno.
"We're stuffed," they say.
"Stuffed."
"You're mother is great," says
Ramona. "What happened to
you?"
"This and that," I say.
"We have something to tell
you," says Lenny.
"I'm so pleased," says Mother.
"So happy."
Good Lord, Lenny and
Mother?
"No, no," says Lenny.
"Silly goose," says Mother.
"Here goes," says Lenny. "I'm
coming back to you."
There is a knock on the door. It
is Lenny. Lenny with flowers.
Lilies. Is this significant?
"Hello," I say. "Get out. Stay.
Go. Da-glo. I'm serious, Lenny.
Read my body language. I slam
the door in his face, lock it, and
slide the bed in front of it. He
looks for the cat on the roof, in
the garden. The cat is in the
refrigerator, hidden among the
foodstuffs.
"Out. Get out."
He goes home to Pasadena,
Angelica, Bitsy, Ramona.
Ramona screams into the
phone. "Satisfied? Look what
you've done! Your Mother wants
to talk to you." I can't smell
Ramona's gunpowder musk, or
Mother's roast. Is this
significant?
"Mother?" What is she doing
in Pasadena?
"I wash my hands of it."says
Mother. "Lord knows I've tried
with you."
"What are you doing in
Pasadena?"
"I've moved in. But now,
thanks to you, there will be ten
sion. Bitsy wants a word with
you."
"Bitsy?" I ask.
"Aw gee," she says. "Gee."
I take the cat out of the fridge.
Touched, he lives six more lives, I
just one. ■ j
