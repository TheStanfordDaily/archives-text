### Sarah L. Allen 
Sarah L. Allen is a senior, majoring
in electrical engineering and home
economics (self-designed). Her rather
avant-garde submission, "Man &
Telephone," is the selected piece of
short fiction for this issue of The Stan
ford Daily Magazine.
One story will appear in each issue,
and its author receives $50.

Men and telephones are
recurring themes in my
life. The telephone is not
a happy medium for me. Also, I
am twenty-five. The phone
reaches out and feels me up.
"Angelica," he says."I love
her."
"Good," 1 say. "Fine."
"Good?" he says. He is
confused. He is Lenny.
"Willow," I say. "Chastity," I
say. "And now Angelica." (Later
Bitsy!) These names, unlike Janet
or Sue, are names that I can cope
with.
"I love her. The place is so
clean you can eat off the floors."
"1 hate you." This is not yet
true.
"I loved you."
"Do you know," 1 say, "what I
dislike most about you?"
"My nazi wife? The arsenic in
the cat dish?"
I had forgotten about the ar
senic. I move to a new apartment.
Waiting for the elevator, I grope
with and marry the doorman,
only to discover we have nothing
in common save a love of good
luggage. I take my phone. I take
the cat who pees all over my
counter tops. I had forgotten
about the arsenic. Is it significant?
"Well, for one thing," I say,
"your nazi wife."
"Oh her."
"How is Maude?"
"Thanks for asking. Fine.
Fine." He is pleased, "for a
cadaver, she's got so much pres
ence. She's got a birthday coming
up. We'll have a get-together.
Nothing fancy. All the interns,
maybe some third-years. We're
still planning."

I say nothing.
"Now hey," he says. "Hey! It's
not like that!" Maude and
Lenny? Something to think
about.
"Bitsy understands me," he
says."I love her. No, I adore
her."
"Bitsy?" (Bitsy!) "Angelica?"
"Oh her. Honestly, what am I
going to do with you?"
"Things seem pretty clear," I
say. "Have I missed something?"
"Hey Babe (Babe?), you aren't
bitter are you? You sound a little,
oh I don't know, down. Wine. Do
you have any?"
"Yes."
"I haven't seen you since the
war. I'll put Maude back together
again and come right up." So he
comes to San Francisco, my
apartment. He opens the door
without knocking Typical!
"You didn't let me finish," I
say. "Yes I have some wine, but
you can't have any. You under
stand." He does, and throws the
cat out the window before return
ing to Pasadena, Bitsy, Angelica,
Maude, his phone.
"What is she like?" Bitsy. I am
a masochist.
"Aw don't," he says. "Don't."
I am even more curious. Bitsy. I
carry the phone into the bath
room. I take a shower. Lenny
joins me. We embrace
awkwardly.
"Out," I say. "Get out! I don't
want to see you." This is not en
tirely true.
" Aw." Lenny drips on the floor
and drop-kicks threat off the fire
escape. Honestly, what did I ever
see in him?
For years I think of Bitsy.

Lenny. Lenny and Bitsy.
Ramona, Angelica, Bitsy and
Lenny. "I'm curious," I say. Can
she be tall, ugly, and obese?
"Maybe," says Lenny. "Maybe
not." God, we had been good to
gether.
I doodle a picture of Bitsy. Per
fect. I ring the doorbell. Ramona,
the nazi wife, answers. "Oh, it's
you," she says.
"Likewise I'm sure," I say.
Ramona wears a regulation hel
met and T-shirt with a swastika
over each breast. This is all she
wears. In the kitchen, Angelica is
cleaning the oven.
I show Lenny my drawing of
Bitsy. It is a picture of a tiny in
consequential woman picking her
tiny nose. She is at Sea World sit
ting on a bag of popcorn.
"Perfect," says Lenny.
"Bitsy?" says Ramona. She
looks over Lenny's shoulder at
the scrap of toilet paper.
"Hmmph, not so great." Does
she mean Bitsy or my drawing?
"Both," says Lenny.
Angelica pulls her head out of
the oven. Though she wears knee
pads and a string bikini, I keep
forgetting what she looks like
from moment to moment. "May I
look?"
"No," says Lenny.
"You missed a spot," says
Ramona.
"Where?" asks Angelica.
Ramona unshoulders her rifle
and fires at the stove. "There,"
she says. " Right there."
"I'd love to chat," I say.
"Really, I would, but. . .
"Stay," says Lenny. "Listen,
we've got your cat in the oven,
wine chilling in the fridge, and

some friends dropping over.
Water under the bridge. Let's be
pals." Pals?
£££1 ome friends" turn out to
Maude and Bitsy.
Maude arrives in a
cardboard box, C.O.D.
"Figures," says Ramona.
Angelica unpacks Maude and
arranges her on the sofa. I like
Angelica, a tolerance of Lenny's
polygamous necrophilia being
just one of the things we have in
common. Bitsy is another matter.
She is exactly as I pictured her,
only much smaller. Years ago, I
had imagined Bitsy to be al
ternately tall and ugly and obese.
She is none of these things. She is
only small. She is dwarfed by her
accessories; hoop earrings and a
bracelet swing from her body like
hoola hoops. I nearly step on her
twice. Finally, Lenny insists she
put a bell around her neck. Ap
parently, this has happened
before.
We play charades. Lenny acts
out Caligula. Bitsy gets it after
Lenny indicates it is a word with
four syllables.
"Cheaters never win. Winners
never cheat," says Ramona.
"Actually ..." begins An
gelica.
Ramona levels her rifle at An
gelica. Angelica sits down next to
Maude on the sofa.
Bitsy ignores Ramona and
slides down Lenny's tie. At least
she does not say "wheee!"' I
remind Ramona that Bitsy did, in
fact, cheat and has, in part, won. I
am next. I act out The Sorrows of
Young Werther. I spend two
minutes miming 'sounds like —
