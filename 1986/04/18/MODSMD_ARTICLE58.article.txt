I was a boy once, a spectator.
I sat in the warmth of my seat,
watching the actors immersed in
red. yellow and orange light per
form while I sat in sublime dark
ness.
Although I was far from the
stage. 1 could see the actors per
fectly. They performed pan
tomimes. A woman was a bird,
another a sun. Everything was a
dream within a dream.
During one performance I
realized the actors were talking. 1
didn't understand anything at
first, and I laughed at the sounds.
But 1 quickly attached meaning to
the words.
From pantomimes the plays
evolved into impossible situations
which were always resolved hap
pily. But, later, one play didn't
end happily. Soon all the actors
were*talking about how bad life
is.
Then I saw something which 1
never imagined could happen: a
jumped up from the
Itfarkness onto the stage. A spot-
BEftt swung around, and the girl
for the first time. She
Seeing this, others
I was scared and
Jtat performance the girl
killed. The others

were randomly given parts, some
of which were good, some bad.
Soon after the incident with the
girl, I awoke from sleeing to find
myself in the front row. only feet
from the stage. I hadn't moved,
and 1 was still in my chair, hut I
was so close to the stage I was al
most part of it. During one scene
a girl was being beaten, and drops
of blood and sweat hit my face.
When I had adapted to the new
position, two shadows grabbed
me and threw me onstage. I had
never been out of the chair, and I
couldn't breathe. People began
grabbing me and shouting at me.
I slipped away and ran to the
edge of the stage, but before me
was a fence which reached the
ceiling. I grabbed on to it, and
through the wire mesh I could see
my chair. In it was a boy I had
never seen, whom I have now for
gotten.
Eventually, the actors subdued
me and I was taken to the direc
tor, who shouted at me for being
insolent. I tried to explain I was a
spectator, not an actor, but he
said no one is a spectator.
He handed me my part. I was
to play a man who searched for
heaven his entire life, but found
only hell.
At first, I refused to act.
