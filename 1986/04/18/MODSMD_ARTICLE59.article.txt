Oh, I just don't know where to
begin
Though he says he'll wait
forever, it's now or never
But she keeps him hanging on,
the silly champion
She says she can't go home
without a chaperone
"Turn . . . that . . . fucking . . .
off," el 1 ipsed the red-haired
woman through clenched teeth.
"That, ma'am, is authentic
American rock'n'roll," I

responded haughtily. But Reed
ley (or Reed, as she wants to be
known these days) didn't seem to
be in the annoy-me-please mood,
so I switched the radio off.
Northbound U.S. 101 traffic
was limited to a few speeding
semis; morning rush would not be
for another hour yet, judging by
the deepening pink of the eastern
sky. A perfect dawn for ambient,
aimless driving, a morning that
me and Reed were not going to
waste writing up the last few
details of the stat mech problem
set.
"Actually, he's Canadian,"
muttered Reed, tugging at her
shoulder harness.
"Still depressed about Mary?"
I sighed. "You've been like this
for days. What's going on be
tween you two?"
"I don't want to talk about her
right now."
"Look, if I were still doing her,
I'd set her up on my knee and
spunk her." She smiled at that
and I knew an explanation was
forthcoming.
"There's that," she began,
then, dropping her tone, contin
ued. "She just does things,
sometimes, y'know, that bother
me. She wastes a lot of my time.
She has to have her new car fixed,
so I have to go with her to the ga
rage, or she has a problem with
chem class, so I have to listen to
her. I guess you know about
that."

"Sounds like she hasn't
changed."
"You still like her?" I don't
think I flinched.
"Not after my operation,"
pause, wait for her grin to
develop, "these days, it's just not
a problem."
"There's that," she agreed.
Near Burlingame, fog swirled into
the slow lanes and traffic began to
pick up — the early commutes
into the City.
Momentarily distracted by the
extra cars, I swerved onto an off
ramp.
"Where're you going?" asked
Reed.
"How should 1 know? I'm only
driving."
"Well, let's hope it's a piece
more interesting than 101."
With thoughts of hell, I floored
the gas until the speedometer
stuck at 75. Immediately, things
got worse.
The sky shifted to a deep
mauve while a fierce easterly at
tacked us from the Bay, which
had mysteriously disappeared to
be replaced by desert. A bright
green sign appeared on the road
shoulder: "The Queen welcomes
you to Arkansas." Another
equally attractive sign informed
us that wherever we were, we
were on Route 66 East.
The wind lost intensity as the
sky, like a queasy stomach,
jumped from magenta to patina
green, finally compromising on a
brilliant noontime blue. The road
narrowed to two lanes and
roadside vegetation became more
frequent, until we were riding a
straight black line, heading into
an impossibly vast tract of rice
seedling farmland.
"Well, this is certainly a piece
more interesting," I noted, as the
right side of the road became the
shore of some random ocean.
"But we'd better get back; the
stat mech's due at five."
Regretfully, I got off the road
at the "Thunder Road" exit, let a
couple of racing Chevys pass and
got back onto Route 66 West.
Unfortunately, after several
dozen miles, it became apparent
that the agents who put us on this
road in the first place were not
going to return us to the appro
priate spot (i.e., 101 North on a
pre-dawn Monday).
The bright sky, the farmland
and the sea, like some dream
memory, persisted, except that
now the sea was on the left and

the farmland was on the right.
Businesses and homes began to
pop up and, as the sea peeled
away from 66, we were in the
middle of a large city, whose
name, we were informed earlier,
was "Welcome to Galiup."
"Getting low on gas," I
mumbled, searching for a station.
Shopping centers, malls, bowling
alleys — teeming with people
hordes — and a "Shaky Hand"
service station just off the
freeway.
"I've never heard of that
brand," said Reed.
"Me neither, but we don't have
much choice." I got out of the car,
but a blue-overalled attendant
beat me to the pump.
"Aren't I in self-serve?" I
asked him, eyeing his badge
which identified him as "Mary —
Senior Service attendant".
" 'Self serve'?" he said, drop
ping the nozzle into my tank.
"Yeah, like am I gonna pay you
a quarter a gallon more for doing
this?"
" 'Quarter?' " he smiled un
comprehendingly. I felt like the
wrong end of a canyon, so 1
looked at the pump's display for a
bit. I discovered that there was no
cost readout. However, it did
measure the number of gallons
dispensed, which was vaguely
reassuring.
"Uh, I only got this twenty."
Alarmed at the mounting figures,
I extracted the bill from my wallet
and waved it in front of his nose.
"Oh, I," he started, staring at
the bill, then fell over, hysterical.
". . .On the house," he
resumed cracking up,
"head. . .to. . .the. . .river," he
gasped for one final assault, "all
will be explained." And broke
into afresh paroxysm.
"Do you always have that ef
fect on gas station personnel?"
asked Mary, coyly, as 1 finished
topping the tank.
"Oink," I replied: the only ap
propriate response.
We grabbed lunch at the "Let
It Be" ("When you find yourself
in times of trouble, we're open
one and twenty-three") cafe,
complete with eighteen-wheelers
parked in front. The meal, like
the gas, was free and again we
were instructed to go to the river.
We spent the next few hours in
the diverting pursuit of searching
back roads, looking for a way out
of Arkansas, always unexpectedly
coming up on a "The Queen

Loves All You Wharf Rats" sign,
always returning to 66.
Everybody we met was invariably
affable, generous to a fault (1
suspected that they probably
would've given us that as well),
and named "Mary", even the os
tensibly male individuals.
"This is a hallucination, and
not a particularly pleasant one at
that," stated Reed, after a burly
lumberjack ("Call m'self Mary up
'round these parts") had been
completely, utterly and unfail
ingly unhelpful about local geog
raphy, except for mentioning "the
river" and how much we'd like it
there, and handing us
mimeographed copies of the
"Wharf Rat" sign.
"Maybe there's a Triple A
there or something," I said,
driving into the late afternoon
sun. Every object had a pretty
purple shadow.
"I was hoping for a beach
party," offered Reed.
"You're nothing but a party,
girl."
"That's party vegetable to you,
sir," snapped Reed. "Hey," she
pointed to a sign, "there's 'The
River' exit."
Capital-The Capital-River exit
seemed to be no different from
the hundreds we'd already tried,
except for the moor-like fog that
descended on us moments after
we'd left 66. I dropped my speed
and cautiously followed the trail
of my headlights forward into the
mist. The road dipped and rose,
following the crest of a levee.
A '69 Chevy sat parked by a
"Wharf — 200 ft." sign; I pulled
up behind it.
"I'll stay and guard the car,"
said Reed. "These hallucinations
can be larcenous."
"Yuh, sure," I replied, slam
ming the door.
The opposite shore wasn't
visible from where we stood, but
as I grew accustomed to the
gloom, I saw The River, running
low over white sand thirty feet
below the levee. A splash
prompted me to resume the quest
and I followed the sound duti
fully, following the road, sloping
down towards the water.
Two of them, a male and a
female, both nude. They had
been taking turns diving off the
long wooden pier at the end of
the levee road, but as I ap
proached, they stood together,
expectantly.
The male waved and intro
