Oh, I just don't know where to
begin
Though he says he'll wait
forever, it's now or never
But she keeps him hanging on,
the silly champion
She says she can't go home
without a chaperone
"Turn . . . that . . . fucking . . .
off," el 1 ipsed the red-haired
woman through clenched teeth.
"That, ma'am, is authentic
American rock'n'roll," I

responded haughtily. But Reed
ley (or Reed, as she wants to be
known these days) didn't seem to
be in the annoy-me-please mood,
so I switched the radio off.
Northbound U.S. 101 traffic
was limited to a few speeding
semis; morning rush would not be
for another hour yet, judging by
the deepening pink of the eastern
sky. A perfect dawn for ambient,
aimless driving, a morning that
me and Reed were not going to
waste writing up the last few
details of the stat mech problem
set.
"Actually, he's Canadian,"
muttered Reed, tugging at her
shoulder harness.
"Still depressed about Mary?"
I sighed. "You've been like this
for days. What's going on be
tween you two?"
"I don't want to talk about her
right now."
"Look, if I were still doing her,
I'd set her up on my knee and
spunk her." She smiled at that
and I knew an explanation was
forthcoming.
"There's that," she began,
then, dropping her tone, contin
ued. "She just does things,
sometimes, y'know, that bother
me. She wastes a lot of my time.
She has to have her new car fixed,
so I have to go with her to the ga
rage, or she has a problem with
chem class, so I have to listen to
her. I guess you know about
that."

"Sounds like she hasn't
changed."
"You still like her?" I don't
think I flinched.
"Not after my operation,"
pause, wait for her grin to
develop, "these days, it's just not
a problem."
"There's that," she agreed.
Near Burlingame, fog swirled into
the slow lanes and traffic began to
pick up — the early commutes
into the City.
Momentarily distracted by the
extra cars, I swerved onto an off
ramp.
"Where're you going?" asked
Reed.
"How should 1 know? I'm only
driving."
"Well, let's hope it's a piece
more interesting than 101."
With thoughts of hell, I floored
the gas until the speedometer
stuck at 75. Immediately, things
got worse.
The sky shifted to a deep
mauve while a fierce easterly at
tacked us from the Bay, which
had mysteriously disappeared to
be replaced by desert. A bright
green sign appeared on the road
shoulder: "The Queen welcomes
you to Arkansas." Another
equally attractive sign informed
us that wherever we were, we
were on Route 66 East.
The wind lost intensity as the
sky, like a queasy stomach,
jumped from magenta to patina
green, finally compromising on a
brilliant noontime blue. The road
narrowed to two lanes and
roadside vegetation became more
frequent, until we were riding a
straight black line, heading into
an impossibly vast tract of rice
seedling farmland.
"Well, this is certainly a piece
more interesting," I noted, as the
right side of the road became the
shore of some random ocean.
"But we'd better get back; the
stat mech's due at five."
Regretfully, I got off the road
at the "Thunder Road" exit, let a
couple of racing Chevys pass and
got back onto Route 66 West.
Unfortunately, after several
dozen miles, it became apparent
that the agents who put us on this
road in the first place were not
going to return us to the appro
priate spot (i.e., 101 North on a
pre-dawn Monday).
The bright sky, the farmland
and the sea, like some dream
memory, persisted, except that
now the sea was on the left and

the farmland was on the right.
Businesses and homes began to
pop up and, as the sea peeled
away from 66, we were in the
middle of a large city, whose
name, we were informed earlier,
was "Welcome to Galiup."
"Getting low on gas," I
mumbled, searching for a station.
Shopping centers, malls, bowling
alleys — teeming with people
hordes — and a "Shaky Hand"
service station just off the
freeway.
"I've never heard of that
brand," said Reed.
"Me neither, but we don't have
much choice." I got out of the car,
but a blue-overalled attendant
beat me to the pump.
"Aren't I in self-serve?" I
asked him, eyeing his badge
which identified him as "Mary —
Senior Service attendant".
" 'Self serve'?" he said, drop
ping the nozzle into my tank.
"Yeah, like am I gonna pay you
a quarter a gallon more for doing
this?"
" 'Quarter?' " he smiled un
comprehendingly. I felt like the
wrong end of a canyon, so 1
looked at the pump's display for a
bit. I discovered that there was no
cost readout. However, it did
measure the number of gallons
dispensed, which was vaguely
reassuring.
"Uh, I only got this twenty."
Alarmed at the mounting figures,
I extracted the bill from my wallet
and waved it in front of his nose.
"Oh, I," he started, staring at
the bill, then fell over, hysterical.
". . .On the house," he
resumed cracking up,
"head. . .to. . .the. . .river," he
gasped for one final assault, "all
will be explained." And broke
into afresh paroxysm.
"Do you always have that ef
fect on gas station personnel?"
asked Mary, coyly, as 1 finished
topping the tank.
"Oink," I replied: the only ap
propriate response.
We grabbed lunch at the "Let
It Be" ("When you find yourself
in times of trouble, we're open
one and twenty-three") cafe,
complete with eighteen-wheelers
parked in front. The meal, like
the gas, was free and again we
were instructed to go to the river.
We spent the next few hours in
the diverting pursuit of searching
back roads, looking for a way out
of Arkansas, always unexpectedly
coming up on a "The Queen

Loves All You Wharf Rats" sign,
always returning to 66.
Everybody we met was invariably
affable, generous to a fault (1
suspected that they probably
would've given us that as well),
and named "Mary", even the os
tensibly male individuals.
"This is a hallucination, and
not a particularly pleasant one at
that," stated Reed, after a burly
lumberjack ("Call m'self Mary up
'round these parts") had been
completely, utterly and unfail
ingly unhelpful about local geog
raphy, except for mentioning "the
river" and how much we'd like it
there, and handing us
mimeographed copies of the
"Wharf Rat" sign.
"Maybe there's a Triple A
there or something," I said,
driving into the late afternoon
sun. Every object had a pretty
purple shadow.
"I was hoping for a beach
party," offered Reed.
"You're nothing but a party,
girl."
"That's party vegetable to you,
sir," snapped Reed. "Hey," she
pointed to a sign, "there's 'The
River' exit."
Capital-The Capital-River exit
seemed to be no different from
the hundreds we'd already tried,
except for the moor-like fog that
descended on us moments after
we'd left 66. I dropped my speed
and cautiously followed the trail
of my headlights forward into the
mist. The road dipped and rose,
following the crest of a levee.
A '69 Chevy sat parked by a
"Wharf — 200 ft." sign; I pulled
up behind it.
"I'll stay and guard the car,"
said Reed. "These hallucinations
can be larcenous."
"Yuh, sure," I replied, slam
ming the door.
The opposite shore wasn't
visible from where we stood, but
as I grew accustomed to the
gloom, I saw The River, running
low over white sand thirty feet
below the levee. A splash
prompted me to resume the quest
and I followed the sound duti
fully, following the road, sloping
down towards the water.
Two of them, a male and a
female, both nude. They had
been taking turns diving off the
long wooden pier at the end of
the levee road, but as I ap
proached, they stood together,
expectantly.
The male waved and intro
duced himself ("Mary") and his
girlfriend ("Mary").
"Oh, wow, you have the same
names," I tried real hard to keep
the sarcasm to a manageable
level. "We're kinda lost. Could
you give us some directions on
how to get out of Arkansas?"
"Sure," replied the male.
"Wait for the steamship."
"Steamship?"
"Yeah, it'll be by in a coupla
minutes, ties up right here." He
pointed his chin at the edge of the
dock.
"I was kinda hoping that we
could drive outta here, like on
66."
"66?" they both exclaimed, si
multaneously and broke into the
same kind of fit as the Shaky
Hand attendant. I hoped that the
female would keep laughing, but
that was another set of points.
"You could drive 66 the rest of
your life and never leave
Arkansas," she was saying. "It's
not really a steamer anyway; it's
more like a car ferry. Just drive
down to the edge of the ramp."
Once again, the whole deal was
gratis.
"We're outta here," I said,
opening the door and shaking
Reed's shoulder. "Wake up."
"I wish I was," yawned Reed.
"So did you find the off switch?"
"Better; we've got a ride on a
riverboat." I started the car.
"There's that," she settled back
to resume her nap. The car
coughed and died.
"No gas?"
"Plenty of gas," I was puzzled.
"Well, it's all downhill from here.
Gimme a push, willya?"
"No problem." Reed slipped
out the door and shoved the car,
which responded by ramming the
Chevy, which proceeded to roll
down the ramp, disappearing into
the mist. There was a twin shout,
then a loud splash.
"Nice," yelled Reed. The fog
began to thin by leaps and
bounds. We watched as The
River appeared in splendor. From
around the downriver bend, as
advertised, the steamship, a Mis
sissippi paddlewheeler with two
black stacks billowing smoke,
glided majestically through the
sunset, finally stopping a few
yards from the wharf. A deck
hand threw a lasso over the tie-up
piling and the naked Marys
(whom I guessed we missed with
the Chevy) secured the line. The
male waved his arm and a great

wooden ramp crashed onto the
wharf from the ship.
"That's our cue," I yelled back
and Reed gave another shove.
They told me later that the whole
event took exactly three minutes
from Reed's push to the last hub
cap falling into place. In between,
I discovered that my brakes had
failed, plunged headlong into the
ship's pitch-black superstructure
and came to a halt by plowing
broadside through a dozen
vintage automobiles.
Surprised over my bodily unity,
I sat in the dark wreckage mo
tionless as the overhead lights
came on. My car had attempted
some form of intercourse with a
'58 Cadillac and I pulled myself
free from that blasphemous un
ion. Reed and the deckhand
sauntered over.
"Go ahead," I wheezed. "Go
ahead, girl, have a laugh on me."
She did; she is not a subtle per
son.
"B Deck; he's waiting to see
you." We followed the deckhand
up a flight of stairs to an im
pressively picture-windowed
room. An enormous man with a
captain's cap, puffing on a pipe
with one hand and holding the
ship's wheel with the other,
turned towards us.
"No, my name isn't Mary, at
least not yet!" he grinned ef
fusively. "Every newcomer asks
that question first. The only Mary
around here's this dame," he
knocked on the wheel, "the
Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Welcome to the Queen Mary; I'm
the captain. Bill Sunset."
"So you're the two we pulled
off of 101," he waited until we
nodded. "I suppose you're won
derin' how you got here and how
you're gettin out. The answer to
the second question is T don't
know' and the answer to the
first's the story of how I got
here." He turned back to the
wheel, motioning us to sit on the
back bench.
"That's my '63 Mercury you
trashed down there, by the way.
The junk folks drive these days, 1
don't see how you can sit in 'em."
He relit his pipe.
"I wasn't always the captain of
a steamer, y'know," he began. "I
started off as a folk singer, not
anywhere you ever heard of. I
was seventeen, it was '65, 1 had a
car and I had a guitar. The neces
sities, y'know. I knew someday
I'd go to New York or L.A. and

make it big, like Dylan or some
thing, but back then, I was havin'
a good time playin' the bars and
local college scene, doin' mostly
my own stuff. I was pretty good at
it.
"Well, things being the way
they were, I got married to the
most fascinatin', beautiful woman
in the world." He paused to give
the wheel a tug to the right. "She
was perfect, except for this one
bad habit; she loved to waste
time. Not only her time, but
everyone around her's too. It
started off slow, like I'd be try in'
to figure out a song and she'd say
'Honey, couldja refill the condi
ment rack?' or' Billy, couldja help
me pull the weeds?'
"These little things got bigger
and bigger, only I didn't figure it
out, 'til one day, I discovered that
I was thirty-five years old and
hadn't done a damn thing I
wanted to do before I met her.
That same day, my wife left. Now,
you'd figure good riddance to bad
rubbish.
"But it wasn't like that. I
thought I'd have all the time in
the world to do all the important
stuff I'd put off, but I ended up
sittin' around the house, makin'
sure the condiment racks were
full and all the weeds were pulled.
"So one day, about a year ago,
I was out drivin', pretty de
pressed, when I got onto Route
66 and ended up here.
"To make it short, 1 found my
wife livin' not too far from here
on The River, at the end of this
run. I moved in with her and set
this ship up as a sorta immigrant
assistance center. I get home
every day about five and we
spend an enjoyable evening fillin'
salt shakers and pullin' dan
delions.
"I think you know what my
wife's name is."
"So why aren't you a Mary?"
asked Reed.
"Oh, that," puffed the Captain,
"I'm still new here. Y'see, most
everyone around here wasn't
called Mary to begin with, just
that their original name wasn't
their real name, y'know what I
mean? I expect one of these days,
I'll forget to call myself'Bill'."
Reed went downstairs to sit on
the prow and watch the wake of
the ship. I suspect she's come to
the same decision I came to. I ap
proached the Captain to ask if he
needed another hand, because I
was home, waiting for Mary. ■

so I switched the radio off.
Northbound U.S. 101 traffic
was limited to a few speeding
semis; morning rush would not be
for another hour yet, judging by
the deepening pink of the eastern
sky. A perfect dawn for ambient,
aimless driving, a morning that
me and Reed were not going to
waste writing up the last few
details of the stat mech problem
set.
"Actually, he's Canadian,"
muttered Reed, tugging at her
shoulder harness.
"Still depressed about Mary?"
I sighed. "You've been like this
for days. What's going on be
tween you two?"
"I don't want to talk about her
right now."
"Look, if I were still doing her,
I'd set her up on my knee and

She has to have her new car fixed,
so I have to go with her to the ga
rage, or she has a problem with
chem class, so I have to listen to
her. I guess you know about
that."

"Sounds like she hasn't
changed."
"You still like her?" I don't
think I flinched.
"Not after my operation,"
pause, wait for her grin to

With thoughts of hell, I floored

beat me to the pump.
"Aren't I in self-serve?" I
asked him, eyeing his badge
which identified him as "Mary —
Senior Service attendant".
" 'Self serve'?" he said, drop
ping the nozzle into my tank.
"Yeah, like am I gonna pay you
a quarter a gallon more for doing
this?"
" 'Quarter?' " he smiled un
comprehendingly. I felt like the
wrong end of a canyon, so 1
looked at the pump's display for a
bit. I discovered that there was no
cost readout. However, it did
measure the number of gallons
dispensed, which was vaguely
reassuring.
"Uh, I only got this twenty."
Alarmed at the mounting figures,
I extracted the bill from my wallet
and waved it in front of his nose.
"Oh, I," he started, staring at

a good time playin' the bars and
local college scene, doin' mostly
my own stuff. I was pretty good at
it.
"Well, things being the way
they were, I got married to the
most fascinatin', beautiful woman
in the world." He paused to give
the wheel a tug to the right. "She
was perfect, except for this one
bad habit; she loved to waste
time. Not only her time, but
everyone around her's too. It
started off slow, like I'd be try in'
to figure out a song and she'd say
'Honey, couldja refill the condi
ment rack?' or' Billy, couldja help
me pull the weeds?'
"These little things got bigger
and bigger, only I didn't figure it
out, 'til one day, I discovered that
I was thirty-five years old and
hadn't done a damn thing I
wanted to do before I met her.
That same day, my wife left. Now,
you'd figure good riddance to bad
rubbish.
"But it wasn't like that. I
thought I'd have all the time in
the world to do all the important
stuff I'd put off, but I ended up
sittin' around the house, makin'
sure the condiment racks were
full and all the weeds were pulled.
"So one day, about a year ago,
I was out drivin', pretty de
pressed, when I got onto Route
66 and ended up here.
"To make it short, 1 found my
wife livin' not too far from here
on The River, at the end of this
run. I moved in with her and set
this ship up as a sorta immigrant
assistance center. I get home
every day about five and we
spend an enjoyable evening fillin'
salt shakers and pullin' dan
delions.
"I think you know what my
wife's name is."
"So why aren't you a Mary?"
asked Reed.
"Oh, that," puffed the Captain,
"I'm still new here. Y'see, most
everyone around here wasn't
called Mary to begin with, just
that their original name wasn't
their real name, y'know what I
mean? I expect one of these days,
I'll forget to call myself'Bill'."
Reed went downstairs to sit on
the prow and watch the wake of
the ship. I suspect she's come to
the same decision I came to. I ap
proached the Captain to ask if he
needed another hand, because I
was home, waiting for Mary. ■

Oh, I just don't know where to
begin
Though he says he'll wait
forever, it's now or never
But she keeps him hanging on,
the silly champion
She says she can't go home
without a chaperone
"Turn . . . that . . . fucking . . .
off," el 1 ipsed the red-haired
woman through clenched teeth.
"That, ma'am, is authentic
American rock'n'roll," I

responded haughtily. But Reed
ley (or Reed, as she wants to be
known these days) didn't seem to
be in the annoy-me-please mood,
so I switched the radio off.
Northbound U.S. 101 traffic
was limited to a few speeding
semis; morning rush would not be
for another hour yet, judging by
the deepening pink of the eastern
sky. A perfect dawn for ambient,
aimless driving, a morning that
me and Reed were not going to
waste writing up the last few
details of the stat mech problem
set.
"Actually, he's Canadian,"
muttered Reed, tugging at her
shoulder harness.
"Still depressed about Mary?"
I sighed. "You've been like this
for days. What's going on be
tween you two?"
"I don't want to talk about her
right now."
"Look, if I were still doing her,
I'd set her up on my knee and
spunk her." She smiled at that
and I knew an explanation was
forthcoming.
"There's that," she began,
then, dropping her tone, contin
ued. "She just does things,
sometimes, y'know, that bother
me. She wastes a lot of my time.
She has to have her new car fixed,
so I have to go with her to the ga
rage, or she has a problem with
chem class, so I have to listen to
her. I guess you know about
that."

"Sounds like she hasn't
changed."
"You still like her?" I don't
think I flinched.
"Not after my operation,"
pause, wait for her grin to
develop, "these days, it's just not
a problem."
"There's that," she agreed.
Near Burlingame, fog swirled into
the slow lanes and traffic began to
pick up — the early commutes
into the City.
Momentarily distracted by the
extra cars, I swerved onto an off
ramp.
"Where're you going?" asked
Reed.
"How should 1 know? I'm only
driving."
"Well, let's hope it's a piece
more interesting than 101."
With thoughts of hell, I floored
the gas until the speedometer
stuck at 75. Immediately, things
got worse.
The sky shifted to a deep
mauve while a fierce easterly at
tacked us from the Bay, which
had mysteriously disappeared to
be replaced by desert. A bright
green sign appeared on the road
shoulder: "The Queen welcomes
you to Arkansas." Another
equally attractive sign informed
us that wherever we were, we
were on Route 66 East.
The wind lost intensity as the
sky, like a queasy stomach,
jumped from magenta to patina
green, finally compromising on a
brilliant noontime blue. The road
narrowed to two lanes and
roadside vegetation became more
frequent, until we were riding a
straight black line, heading into
an impossibly vast tract of rice
seedling farmland.
"Well, this is certainly a piece
more interesting," I noted, as the
right side of the road became the
shore of some random ocean.
"But we'd better get back; the
stat mech's due at five."
Regretfully, I got off the road
at the "Thunder Road" exit, let a
couple of racing Chevys pass and
got back onto Route 66 West.
Unfortunately, after several
dozen miles, it became apparent
that the agents who put us on this
road in the first place were not
going to return us to the appro
priate spot (i.e., 101 North on a
pre-dawn Monday).
The bright sky, the farmland
and the sea, like some dream
memory, persisted, except that
now the sea was on the left and

the farmland was on the right.
Businesses and homes began to
pop up and, as the sea peeled
away from 66, we were in the
middle of a large city, whose
name, we were informed earlier,
was "Welcome to Galiup."
"Getting low on gas," I
mumbled, searching for a station.
Shopping centers, malls, bowling
alleys — teeming with people
hordes — and a "Shaky Hand"
service station just off the
freeway.
"I've never heard of that
brand," said Reed.
"Me neither, but we don't have
much choice." I got out of the car,
but a blue-overalled attendant
beat me to the pump.
"Aren't I in self-serve?" I
asked him, eyeing his badge
which identified him as "Mary —
Senior Service attendant".
" 'Self serve'?" he said, drop
ping the nozzle into my tank.
"Yeah, like am I gonna pay you
a quarter a gallon more for doing
this?"
" 'Quarter?' " he smiled un
comprehendingly. I felt like the
wrong end of a canyon, so 1
looked at the pump's display for a
bit. I discovered that there was no
cost readout. However, it did
measure the number of gallons
dispensed, which was vaguely
reassuring.
"Uh, I only got this twenty."
Alarmed at the mounting figures,
I extracted the bill from my wallet
and waved it in front of his nose.
"Oh, I," he started, staring at
the bill, then fell over, hysterical.
". . .On the house," he
resumed cracking up,
"head. . .to. . .the. . .river," he
gasped for one final assault, "all
will be explained." And broke
into afresh paroxysm.
"Do you always have that ef
fect on gas station personnel?"
asked Mary, coyly, as 1 finished
topping the tank.
"Oink," I replied: the only ap
propriate response.
We grabbed lunch at the "Let
It Be" ("When you find yourself
in times of trouble, we're open
one and twenty-three") cafe,
complete with eighteen-wheelers
parked in front. The meal, like
the gas, was free and again we
were instructed to go to the river.
We spent the next few hours in
the diverting pursuit of searching
back roads, looking for a way out
of Arkansas, always unexpectedly
coming up on a "The Queen

Loves All You Wharf Rats" sign,
always returning to 66.
Everybody we met was invariably
affable, generous to a fault (1
suspected that they probably
would've given us that as well),
and named "Mary", even the os
tensibly male individuals.
"This is a hallucination, and
not a particularly pleasant one at
that," stated Reed, after a burly
lumberjack ("Call m'self Mary up
'round these parts") had been
completely, utterly and unfail
ingly unhelpful about local geog
raphy, except for mentioning "the
river" and how much we'd like it
there, and handing us
mimeographed copies of the
"Wharf Rat" sign.
"Maybe there's a Triple A
there or something," I said,
driving into the late afternoon
sun. Every object had a pretty
purple shadow.
"I was hoping for a beach
party," offered Reed.
"You're nothing but a party,
girl."
"That's party vegetable to you,
sir," snapped Reed. "Hey," she
pointed to a sign, "there's 'The
River' exit."
Capital-The Capital-River exit
seemed to be no different from
the hundreds we'd already tried,
except for the moor-like fog that
descended on us moments after
we'd left 66. I dropped my speed
and cautiously followed the trail
of my headlights forward into the
mist. The road dipped and rose,
following the crest of a levee.
A '69 Chevy sat parked by a
"Wharf — 200 ft." sign; I pulled
up behind it.
"I'll stay and guard the car,"
said Reed. "These hallucinations
can be larcenous."
"Yuh, sure," I replied, slam
ming the door.
The opposite shore wasn't
visible from where we stood, but
as I grew accustomed to the
gloom, I saw The River, running
low over white sand thirty feet
below the levee. A splash
prompted me to resume the quest
and I followed the sound duti
fully, following the road, sloping
down towards the water.
Two of them, a male and a
female, both nude. They had
been taking turns diving off the
long wooden pier at the end of
the levee road, but as I ap
proached, they stood together,
expectantly.
The male waved and intro
duced himself ("Mary") and his
girlfriend ("Mary").
"Oh, wow, you have the same
names," I tried real hard to keep
the sarcasm to a manageable
level. "We're kinda lost. Could
you give us some directions on
how to get out of Arkansas?"
"Sure," replied the male.
"Wait for the steamship."
"Steamship?"
"Yeah, it'll be by in a coupla
minutes, ties up right here." He
pointed his chin at the edge of the
dock.
"I was kinda hoping that we
could drive outta here, like on
66."
"66?" they both exclaimed, si
multaneously and broke into the
same kind of fit as the Shaky
Hand attendant. I hoped that the
female would keep laughing, but
that was another set of points.
"You could drive 66 the rest of
your life and never leave
Arkansas," she was saying. "It's
not really a steamer anyway; it's
more like a car ferry. Just drive
down to the edge of the ramp."
Once again, the whole deal was
gratis.
"We're outta here," I said,
opening the door and shaking
Reed's shoulder. "Wake up."
"I wish I was," yawned Reed.
"So did you find the off switch?"
"Better; we've got a ride on a
riverboat." I started the car.
"There's that," she settled back
to resume her nap. The car
coughed and died.
"No gas?"
"Plenty of gas," I was puzzled.
"Well, it's all downhill from here.
Gimme a push, willya?"
"No problem." Reed slipped
out the door and shoved the car,
which responded by ramming the
Chevy, which proceeded to roll
down the ramp, disappearing into
the mist. There was a twin shout,
then a loud splash.
"Nice," yelled Reed. The fog
began to thin by leaps and
bounds. We watched as The
River appeared in splendor. From
around the downriver bend, as
advertised, the steamship, a Mis
sissippi paddlewheeler with two
black stacks billowing smoke,
glided majestically through the
sunset, finally stopping a few
yards from the wharf. A deck
hand threw a lasso over the tie-up
piling and the naked Marys
(whom I guessed we missed with
the Chevy) secured the line. The
male waved his arm and a great

wooden ramp crashed onto the
wharf from the ship.
"That's our cue," I yelled back
and Reed gave another shove.
They told me later that the whole
event took exactly three minutes
from Reed's push to the last hub
cap falling into place. In between,
I discovered that my brakes had
failed, plunged headlong into the
ship's pitch-black superstructure
and came to a halt by plowing
broadside through a dozen
vintage automobiles.
Surprised over my bodily unity,
I sat in the dark wreckage mo
tionless as the overhead lights
came on. My car had attempted
some form of intercourse with a
'58 Cadillac and I pulled myself
free from that blasphemous un
ion. Reed and the deckhand
sauntered over.
"Go ahead," I wheezed. "Go
ahead, girl, have a laugh on me."
She did; she is not a subtle per
son.
"B Deck; he's waiting to see
you." We followed the deckhand
up a flight of stairs to an im
pressively picture-windowed
room. An enormous man with a
captain's cap, puffing on a pipe
with one hand and holding the
ship's wheel with the other,
turned towards us.
"No, my name isn't Mary, at
least not yet!" he grinned ef
fusively. "Every newcomer asks
that question first. The only Mary
around here's this dame," he
knocked on the wheel, "the
Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Welcome to the Queen Mary; I'm
the captain. Bill Sunset."
"So you're the two we pulled
off of 101," he waited until we
nodded. "I suppose you're won
derin' how you got here and how
you're gettin out. The answer to
the second question is T don't
know' and the answer to the
first's the story of how I got
here." He turned back to the
wheel, motioning us to sit on the
back bench.
"That's my '63 Mercury you
trashed down there, by the way.
The junk folks drive these days, 1
don't see how you can sit in 'em."
He relit his pipe.
"I wasn't always the captain of
a steamer, y'know," he began. "I
started off as a folk singer, not
anywhere you ever heard of. I
was seventeen, it was '65, 1 had a
car and I had a guitar. The neces
sities, y'know. I knew someday
I'd go to New York or L.A. and

make it big, like Dylan or some
thing, but back then, I was havin'
a good time playin' the bars and
local college scene, doin' mostly
my own stuff. I was pretty good at
it.
"Well, things being the way
they were, I got married to the
most fascinatin', beautiful woman
in the world." He paused to give
the wheel a tug to the right. "She
was perfect, except for this one
bad habit; she loved to waste

started off slow, like I'd be try in'

'Honey, couldja refill the condi
ment rack?' or' Billy, couldja help

event took exactly three minutes
from Reed's push to the last hub
cap falling into place. In between,
I discovered that my brakes had
failed, plunged headlong into the
ship's pitch-black superstructure
and came to a halt by plowing
broadside through a dozen
vintage automobiles.
Surprised over my bodily unity,
I sat in the dark wreckage mo
tionless as the overhead lights
came on. My car had attempted
some form of intercourse with a
'58 Cadillac and I pulled myself
free from that blasphemous un
ion. Reed and the deckhand
sauntered over.
"Go ahead," I wheezed. "Go
ahead, girl, have a laugh on me."
She did; she is not a subtle per
son.
"B Deck; he's waiting to see
you." We followed the deckhand
up a flight of stairs to an im
pressively picture-windowed
room. An enormous man with a
captain's cap, puffing on a pipe
with one hand and holding the
ship's wheel with the other,
turned towards us.
"No, my name isn't Mary, at
least not yet!" he grinned ef
fusively. "Every newcomer asks
that question first. The only Mary
around here's this dame," he
knocked on the wheel, "the
Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Welcome to the Queen Mary; I'm
the captain. Bill Sunset."
"So you're the two we pulled
off of 101," he waited until we
nodded. "I suppose you're won
derin' how you got here and how
you're gettin out. The answer to
the second question is T don't
know' and the answer to the
first's the story of how I got
here." He turned back to the
wheel, motioning us to sit on the
back bench.
"That's my '63 Mercury you
trashed down there, by the way.
The junk folks drive these days, 1
don't see how you can sit in 'em."
He relit his pipe.
"I wasn't always the captain of
a steamer, y'know," he began. "I
started off as a folk singer, not
anywhere you ever heard of. I
was seventeen, it was '65, 1 had a
car and I had a guitar. The neces
sities, y'know. I knew someday
I'd go to New York or L.A. and

make it big, like Dylan or some
thing, but back then, I was havin'
a good time playin' the bars and
local college scene, doin' mostly
my own stuff. I was pretty good at
it.
"Well, things being the way
they were, I got married to the
most fascinatin', beautiful woman
in the world." He paused to give
the wheel a tug to the right. "She
was perfect, except for this one
bad habit; she loved to waste
time. Not only her time, but
everyone around her's too. It
started off slow, like I'd be try in'
to figure out a song and she'd say
'Honey, couldja refill the condi
ment rack?' or' Billy, couldja help
me pull the weeds?'
"These little things got bigger
and bigger, only I didn't figure it
out, 'til one day, I discovered that
I was thirty-five years old and
hadn't done a damn thing I
wanted to do before I met her.
That same day, my wife left. Now,
you'd figure good riddance to bad
rubbish.
"But it wasn't like that. I
thought I'd have all the time in
the world to do all the important
stuff I'd put off, but I ended up
sittin' around the house, makin'
sure the condiment racks were
full and all the weeds were pulled.
"So one day, about a year ago,
I was out drivin', pretty de
pressed, when I got onto Route
66 and ended up here.
"To make it short, 1 found my
wife livin' not too far from here
on The River, at the end of this
run. I moved in with her and set
this ship up as a sorta immigrant
assistance center. I get home
every day about five and we
spend an enjoyable evening fillin'
salt shakers and pullin' dan
delions.
"I think you know what my
wife's name is."
"So why aren't you a Mary?"
asked Reed.
"Oh, that," puffed the Captain,
"I'm still new here. Y'see, most
everyone around here wasn't
called Mary to begin with, just
that their original name wasn't
their real name, y'know what I
mean? I expect one of these days,
I'll forget to call myself'Bill'."
Reed went downstairs to sit on
the prow and watch the wake of
the ship. I suspect she's come to
the same decision I came to. I ap
proached the Captain to ask if he
needed another hand, because I
was home, waiting for Mary. ■

Oh, I just don't know where to
begin
Though he says he'll wait
forever, it's now or never
But she keeps him hanging on,
the silly champion
She says she can't go home
without a chaperone
"Turn . . . that . . . fucking . . .
off," el 1 ipsed the red-haired
woman through clenched teeth.
"That, ma'am, is authentic
American rock'n'roll," I

responded haughtily. But Reed
ley (or Reed, as she wants to be
known these days) didn't seem to
be in the annoy-me-please mood,
so I switched the radio off.
Northbound U.S. 101 traffic
was limited to a few speeding
semis; morning rush would not be
for another hour yet, judging by
the deepening pink of the eastern
sky. A perfect dawn for ambient,
aimless driving, a morning that
me and Reed were not going to
waste writing up the last few
details of the stat mech problem
set.
"Actually, he's Canadian,"
muttered Reed, tugging at her
shoulder harness.
"Still depressed about Mary?"
I sighed. "You've been like this
for days. What's going on be
tween you two?"
"I don't want to talk about her
right now."
"Look, if I were still doing her,
I'd set her up on my knee and
spunk her." She smiled at that
and I knew an explanation was
forthcoming.
"There's that," she began,
then, dropping her tone, contin
ued. "She just does things,
sometimes, y'know, that bother
me. She wastes a lot of my time.
She has to have her new car fixed,
so I have to go with her to the ga
rage, or she has a problem with
chem class, so I have to listen to
her. I guess you know about
that."

"Sounds like she hasn't
changed."
"You still like her?" I don't
think I flinched.
"Not after my operation,"
pause, wait for her grin to
develop, "these days, it's just not
a problem."
"There's that," she agreed.
Near Burlingame, fog swirled into
the slow lanes and traffic began to
pick up — the early commutes
into the City.
Momentarily distracted by the
extra cars, I swerved onto an off
ramp.
"Where're you going?" asked
Reed.
"How should 1 know? I'm only
driving."
"Well, let's hope it's a piece
more interesting than 101."
With thoughts of hell, I floored
the gas until the speedometer
stuck at 75. Immediately, things
got worse.
The sky shifted to a deep
mauve while a fierce easterly at
tacked us from the Bay, which
had mysteriously disappeared to
be replaced by desert. A bright
green sign appeared on the road
shoulder: "The Queen welcomes
you to Arkansas." Another
equally attractive sign informed
us that wherever we were, we
were on Route 66 East.
The wind lost intensity as the
sky, like a queasy stomach,
jumped from magenta to patina
green, finally compromising on a
brilliant noontime blue. The road
narrowed to two lanes and
roadside vegetation became more
frequent, until we were riding a
straight black line, heading into
an impossibly vast tract of rice
seedling farmland.
"Well, this is certainly a piece
more interesting," I noted, as the
right side of the road became the
shore of some random ocean.
"But we'd better get back; the
stat mech's due at five."
Regretfully, I got off the road
at the "Thunder Road" exit, let a
couple of racing Chevys pass and
got back onto Route 66 West.
Unfortunately, after several
dozen miles, it became apparent
that the agents who put us on this
road in the first place were not
going to return us to the appro
priate spot (i.e., 101 North on a
pre-dawn Monday).
The bright sky, the farmland
and the sea, like some dream
memory, persisted, except that
now the sea was on the left and

the farmland was on the right.
Businesses and homes began to
pop up and, as the sea peeled
away from 66, we were in the
middle of a large city, whose
name, we were informed earlier,
was "Welcome to Galiup."
"Getting low on gas," I
mumbled, searching for a station.
Shopping centers, malls, bowling
alleys — teeming with people
hordes — and a "Shaky Hand"
service station just off the
freeway.
"I've never heard of that
brand," said Reed.
"Me neither, but we don't have
much choice." I got out of the car,
but a blue-overalled attendant
beat me to the pump.
"Aren't I in self-serve?" I
asked him, eyeing his badge
which identified him as "Mary —
Senior Service attendant".
" 'Self serve'?" he said, drop
ping the nozzle into my tank.
"Yeah, like am I gonna pay you
a quarter a gallon more for doing
this?"
" 'Quarter?' " he smiled un
comprehendingly. I felt like the
wrong end of a canyon, so 1
looked at the pump's display for a
bit. I discovered that there was no
cost readout. However, it did
measure the number of gallons
dispensed, which was vaguely
reassuring.
"Uh, I only got this twenty."
Alarmed at the mounting figures,
I extracted the bill from my wallet
and waved it in front of his nose.
"Oh, I," he started, staring at
the bill, then fell over, hysterical.
". . .On the house," he
resumed cracking up,
"head. . .to. . .the. . .river," he
gasped for one final assault, "all
will be explained." And broke
into afresh paroxysm.
"Do you always have that ef
fect on gas station personnel?"
asked Mary, coyly, as 1 finished
topping the tank.
"Oink," I replied: the only ap
propriate response.
We grabbed lunch at the "Let
It Be" ("When you find yourself
in times of trouble, we're open
one and twenty-three") cafe,
complete with eighteen-wheelers
parked in front. The meal, like
the gas, was free and again we
were instructed to go to the river.
We spent the next few hours in
the diverting pursuit of searching
back roads, looking for a way out
of Arkansas, always unexpectedly
coming up on a "The Queen

Loves All You Wharf Rats" sign,
always returning to 66.
Everybody we met was invariably
affable, generous to a fault (1
suspected that they probably
would've given us that as well),
and named "Mary", even the os
tensibly male individuals.
"This is a hallucination, and
not a particularly pleasant one at
that," stated Reed, after a burly
lumberjack ("Call m'self Mary up
'round these parts") had been
completely, utterly and unfail
ingly unhelpful about local geog
raphy, except for mentioning "the
river" and how much we'd like it
there, and handing us
mimeographed copies of the
"Wharf Rat" sign.
"Maybe there's a Triple A
there or something," I said,
driving into the late afternoon
sun. Every object had a pretty
purple shadow.
"I was hoping for a beach
party," offered Reed.
"You're nothing but a party,
girl."
"That's party vegetable to you,
sir," snapped Reed. "Hey," she
pointed to a sign, "there's 'The
River' exit."
Capital-The Capital-River exit
seemed to be no different from
the hundreds we'd already tried,
except for the moor-like fog that
descended on us moments after
we'd left 66. I dropped my speed
and cautiously followed the trail
of my headlights forward into the
mist. The road dipped and rose,
following the crest of a levee.
A '69 Chevy sat parked by a
"Wharf — 200 ft." sign; I pulled
up behind it.
"I'll stay and guard the car,"
said Reed. "These hallucinations
can be larcenous."
"Yuh, sure," I replied, slam
ming the door.
The opposite shore wasn't
visible from where we stood, but
as I grew accustomed to the
gloom, I saw The River, running
low over white sand thirty feet
below the levee. A splash
prompted me to resume the quest
and I followed the sound duti
fully, following the road, sloping
down towards the water.
Two of them, a male and a
female, both nude. They had
been taking turns diving off the
long wooden pier at the end of
the levee road, but as I ap
proached, they stood together,
expectantly.
The male waved and intro
duced himself ("Mary") and his
girlfriend ("Mary").
"Oh, wow, you have the same
names," I tried real hard to keep
the sarcasm to a manageable
level. "We're kinda lost. Could
you give us some directions on
how to get out of Arkansas?"
"Sure," replied the male.
"Wait for the steamship."
"Steamship?"
"Yeah, it'll be by in a coupla
minutes, ties up right here." He
pointed his chin at the edge of the
dock.
"I was kinda hoping that we
could drive outta here, like on
66."
"66?" they both exclaimed, si
multaneously and broke into the
same kind of fit as the Shaky
Hand attendant. I hoped that the
female would keep laughing, but
that was another set of points.
"You could drive 66 the rest of
your life and never leave
Arkansas," she was saying. "It's
not really a steamer anyway; it's
more like a car ferry. Just drive
down to the edge of the ramp."
Once again, the whole deal was
gratis.
"We're outta here," I said,
opening the door and shaking
Reed's shoulder. "Wake up."
"I wish I was," yawned Reed.
"So did you find the off switch?"
"Better; we've got a ride on a
riverboat." I started the car.
"There's that," she settled back
to resume her nap. The car
coughed and died.
"No gas?"
"Plenty of gas," I was puzzled.
"Well, it's all downhill from here.
Gimme a push, willya?"
"No problem." Reed slipped
out the door and shoved the car,
which responded by ramming the
Chevy, which proceeded to roll
down the ramp, disappearing into
the mist. There was a twin shout,
then a loud splash.
"Nice," yelled Reed. The fog
began to thin by leaps and
bounds. We watched as The
River appeared in splendor. From
around the downriver bend, as
advertised, the steamship, a Mis
sissippi paddlewheeler with two
black stacks billowing smoke,
glided majestically through the
sunset, finally stopping a few
yards from the wharf. A deck
hand threw a lasso over the tie-up
piling and the naked Marys
(whom I guessed we missed with
the Chevy) secured the line. The
male waved his arm and a great

wooden ramp crashed onto the
wharf from the ship.
"That's our cue," I yelled back
and Reed gave another shove.
They told me later that the whole
event took exactly three minutes
from Reed's push to the last hub
cap falling into place. In between,
I discovered that my brakes had
failed, plunged headlong into the
ship's pitch-black superstructure
and came to a halt by plowing
broadside through a dozen
vintage automobiles.
Surprised over my bodily unity,
I sat in the dark wreckage mo
tionless as the overhead lights
came on. My car had attempted
some form of intercourse with a
'58 Cadillac and I pulled myself
free from that blasphemous un
ion. Reed and the deckhand
sauntered over.
"Go ahead," I wheezed. "Go
ahead, girl, have a laugh on me."
She did; she is not a subtle per
son.
"B Deck; he's waiting to see
you." We followed the deckhand
up a flight of stairs to an im
pressively picture-windowed
room. An enormous man with a
captain's cap, puffing on a pipe
with one hand and holding the
ship's wheel with the other,
turned towards us.
"No, my name isn't Mary, at
least not yet!" he grinned ef
fusively. "Every newcomer asks

names," I tried real hard to keep
the sarcasm to a manageable
level. "We're kinda lost. Could
you give us some directions on
how to get out of Arkansas?"
"Sure," replied the male.
"Wait for the steamship."
"Steamship?"
"Yeah, it'll be by in a coupla
minutes, ties up right here." He
pointed his chin at the edge of the
dock.
"I was kinda hoping that we
could drive outta here, like on
66."
"66?" they both exclaimed, si
multaneously and broke into the
same kind of fit as the Shaky
Hand attendant. I hoped that the
female would keep laughing, but
that was another set of points.
"You could drive 66 the rest of
your life and never leave
Arkansas," she was saying. "It's
not really a steamer anyway; it's
more like a car ferry. Just drive
down to the edge of the ramp."
Once again, the whole deal was
gratis.
"We're outta here," I said,
opening the door and shaking
Reed's shoulder. "Wake up."
"I wish I was," yawned Reed.
"So did you find the off switch?"
"Better; we've got a ride on a
riverboat." I started the car.
"There's that," she settled back
to resume her nap. The car
coughed and died.
"No gas?"
"Plenty of gas," I was puzzled.
"Well, it's all downhill from here.
Gimme a push, willya?"
"No problem." Reed slipped
out the door and shoved the car,
which responded by ramming the
Chevy, which proceeded to roll
down the ramp, disappearing into
the mist. There was a twin shout,
then a loud splash.
"Nice," yelled Reed. The fog
began to thin by leaps and
bounds. We watched as The
River appeared in splendor. From
around the downriver bend, as
advertised, the steamship, a Mis
sissippi paddlewheeler with two
black stacks billowing smoke,
glided majestically through the
sunset, finally stopping a few
yards from the wharf. A deck
hand threw a lasso over the tie-up
piling and the naked Marys
(whom I guessed we missed with
the Chevy) secured the line. The
male waved his arm and a great

wooden ramp crashed onto the
wharf from the ship.
"That's our cue," I yelled back
and Reed gave another shove.
They told me later that the whole
event took exactly three minutes
from Reed's push to the last hub
cap falling into place. In between,
I discovered that my brakes had
failed, plunged headlong into the
ship's pitch-black superstructure
and came to a halt by plowing
broadside through a dozen
vintage automobiles.
Surprised over my bodily unity,
I sat in the dark wreckage mo
tionless as the overhead lights
came on. My car had attempted
some form of intercourse with a
'58 Cadillac and I pulled myself
free from that blasphemous un
ion. Reed and the deckhand
sauntered over.
"Go ahead," I wheezed. "Go
ahead, girl, have a laugh on me."
She did; she is not a subtle per
son.
"B Deck; he's waiting to see
you." We followed the deckhand
up a flight of stairs to an im
pressively picture-windowed
room. An enormous man with a
captain's cap, puffing on a pipe
with one hand and holding the
ship's wheel with the other,
turned towards us.
"No, my name isn't Mary, at
least not yet!" he grinned ef
fusively. "Every newcomer asks
that question first. The only Mary
around here's this dame," he
knocked on the wheel, "the
Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Welcome to the Queen Mary; I'm
the captain. Bill Sunset."
"So you're the two we pulled
off of 101," he waited until we
nodded. "I suppose you're won
derin' how you got here and how
you're gettin out. The answer to
the second question is T don't
know' and the answer to the
first's the story of how I got
here." He turned back to the
wheel, motioning us to sit on the
back bench.
"That's my '63 Mercury you
trashed down there, by the way.
The junk folks drive these days, 1
don't see how you can sit in 'em."
He relit his pipe.
"I wasn't always the captain of
a steamer, y'know," he began. "I
started off as a folk singer, not
anywhere you ever heard of. I
was seventeen, it was '65, 1 had a
car and I had a guitar. The neces
sities, y'know. I knew someday
I'd go to New York or L.A. and

make it big, like Dylan or some
thing, but back then, I was havin'
a good time playin' the bars and
local college scene, doin' mostly
my own stuff. I was pretty good at
it.
"Well, things being the way
they were, I got married to the
most fascinatin', beautiful woman
in the world." He paused to give
the wheel a tug to the right. "She
was perfect, except for this one
bad habit; she loved to waste
time. Not only her time, but
everyone around her's too. It
started off slow, like I'd be try in'
to figure out a song and she'd say
'Honey, couldja refill the condi
ment rack?' or' Billy, couldja help
me pull the weeds?'
"These little things got bigger
and bigger, only I didn't figure it
out, 'til one day, I discovered that
I was thirty-five years old and
hadn't done a damn thing I
wanted to do before I met her.
That same day, my wife left. Now,
you'd figure good riddance to bad
rubbish.
"But it wasn't like that. I
thought I'd have all the time in
the world to do all the important
stuff I'd put off, but I ended up
sittin' around the house, makin'
sure the condiment racks were
full and all the weeds were pulled.
"So one day, about a year ago,
I was out drivin', pretty de
pressed, when I got onto Route
66 and ended up here.
"To make it short, 1 found my
wife livin' not too far from here
on The River, at the end of this
run. I moved in with her and set
this ship up as a sorta immigrant
assistance center. I get home
every day about five and we
spend an enjoyable evening fillin'
salt shakers and pullin' dan
delions.
"I think you know what my
wife's name is."
"So why aren't you a Mary?"
asked Reed.
"Oh, that," puffed the Captain,
"I'm still new here. Y'see, most
everyone around here wasn't
called Mary to begin with, just
that their original name wasn't
their real name, y'know what I
mean? I expect one of these days,
I'll forget to call myself'Bill'."
Reed went downstairs to sit on
the prow and watch the wake of
the ship. I suspect she's come to
the same decision I came to. I ap
proached the Captain to ask if he
needed another hand, because I
was home, waiting for Mary. ■

Oh, I just don't know where to

Though he says he'll wait

She says she can't go home
without a chaperone
"Turn . . . that . . . fucking . . .
off," el 1 ipsed the red-haired
woman through clenched teeth.
"That, ma'am, is authentic
American rock'n'roll," I

responded haughtily. But Reed
ley (or Reed, as she wants to be
known these days) didn't seem to
be in the annoy-me-please mood,
so I switched the radio off.
Northbound U.S. 101 traffic
was limited to a few speeding
semis; morning rush would not be
for another hour yet, judging by
the deepening pink of the eastern
sky. A perfect dawn for ambient,
aimless driving, a morning that
me and Reed were not going to
waste writing up the last few
details of the stat mech problem
set.
"Actually, he's Canadian,"
muttered Reed, tugging at her
shoulder harness.
"Still depressed about Mary?"
I sighed. "You've been like this
for days. What's going on be
tween you two?"
"I don't want to talk about her
right now."
"Look, if I were still doing her,
I'd set her up on my knee and
spunk her." She smiled at that
and I knew an explanation was
forthcoming.
"There's that," she began,
then, dropping her tone, contin
ued. "She just does things,
sometimes, y'know, that bother
me. She wastes a lot of my time.
She has to have her new car fixed,
so I have to go with her to the ga
rage, or she has a problem with
chem class, so I have to listen to
her. I guess you know about
that."

"Sounds like she hasn't
changed."
"You still like her?" I don't
think I flinched.
"Not after my operation,"
pause, wait for her grin to
develop, "these days, it's just not
a problem."
"There's that," she agreed.
Near Burlingame, fog swirled into
the slow lanes and traffic began to
pick up — the early commutes
into the City.
Momentarily distracted by the
extra cars, I swerved onto an off
ramp.
"Where're you going?" asked
Reed.
"How should 1 know? I'm only
driving."
"Well, let's hope it's a piece
more interesting than 101."
With thoughts of hell, I floored
the gas until the speedometer
stuck at 75. Immediately, things
got worse.
The sky shifted to a deep
mauve while a fierce easterly at
tacked us from the Bay, which
had mysteriously disappeared to
be replaced by desert. A bright
green sign appeared on the road
shoulder: "The Queen welcomes
you to Arkansas." Another
equally attractive sign informed
us that wherever we were, we
were on Route 66 East.
The wind lost intensity as the
sky, like a queasy stomach,
jumped from magenta to patina
green, finally compromising on a
brilliant noontime blue. The road
narrowed to two lanes and
roadside vegetation became more
frequent, until we were riding a
straight black line, heading into
an impossibly vast tract of rice
seedling farmland.
"Well, this is certainly a piece
more interesting," I noted, as the
right side of the road became the
shore of some random ocean.
"But we'd better get back; the
stat mech's due at five."
Regretfully, I got off the road
at the "Thunder Road" exit, let a
couple of racing Chevys pass and
got back onto Route 66 West.
Unfortunately, after several
dozen miles, it became apparent
that the agents who put us on this
road in the first place were not
going to return us to the appro
priate spot (i.e., 101 North on a
pre-dawn Monday).
The bright sky, the farmland
and the sea, like some dream
memory, persisted, except that
now the sea was on the left and

the farmland was on the right.
Businesses and homes began to
pop up and, as the sea peeled
away from 66, we were in the
middle of a large city, whose
name, we were informed earlier,
was "Welcome to Galiup."
"Getting low on gas," I
mumbled, searching for a station.
Shopping centers, malls, bowling
alleys — teeming with people
hordes — and a "Shaky Hand"
service station just off the
freeway.
"I've never heard of that
brand," said Reed.
"Me neither, but we don't have
much choice." I got out of the car,
but a blue-overalled attendant
beat me to the pump.
"Aren't I in self-serve?" I
asked him, eyeing his badge
which identified him as "Mary —
Senior Service attendant".
" 'Self serve'?" he said, drop
ping the nozzle into my tank.
"Yeah, like am I gonna pay you
a quarter a gallon more for doing
this?"
" 'Quarter?' " he smiled un
comprehendingly. I felt like the
wrong end of a canyon, so 1
looked at the pump's display for a
bit. I discovered that there was no
cost readout. However, it did
measure the number of gallons
dispensed, which was vaguely
reassuring.
"Uh, I only got this twenty."
Alarmed at the mounting figures,
I extracted the bill from my wallet
and waved it in front of his nose.
"Oh, I," he started, staring at
the bill, then fell over, hysterical.
". . .On the house," he
resumed cracking up,
"head. . .to. . .the. . .river," he
gasped for one final assault, "all
will be explained." And broke
into afresh paroxysm.
"Do you always have that ef
fect on gas station personnel?"
asked Mary, coyly, as 1 finished
topping the tank.
"Oink," I replied: the only ap
propriate response.
We grabbed lunch at the "Let
It Be" ("When you find yourself
in times of trouble, we're open
one and twenty-three") cafe,
complete with eighteen-wheelers
parked in front. The meal, like
the gas, was free and again we
were instructed to go to the river.
We spent the next few hours in
the diverting pursuit of searching
back roads, looking for a way out
of Arkansas, always unexpectedly
coming up on a "The Queen

Loves All You Wharf Rats" sign,
always returning to 66.
Everybody we met was invariably
affable, generous to a fault (1
suspected that they probably
would've given us that as well),
and named "Mary", even the os
tensibly male individuals.
"This is a hallucination, and
not a particularly pleasant one at
that," stated Reed, after a burly
lumberjack ("Call m'self Mary up
'round these parts") had been
completely, utterly and unfail
ingly unhelpful about local geog
raphy, except for mentioning "the
river" and how much we'd like it
there, and handing us
mimeographed copies of the
"Wharf Rat" sign.
"Maybe there's a Triple A
there or something," I said,
driving into the late afternoon
sun. Every object had a pretty
purple shadow.
"I was hoping for a beach
party," offered Reed.
"You're nothing but a party,
girl."
"That's party vegetable to you,
sir," snapped Reed. "Hey," she
pointed to a sign, "there's 'The
River' exit."
Capital-The Capital-River exit
seemed to be no different from
the hundreds we'd already tried,
except for the moor-like fog that
descended on us moments after
we'd left 66. I dropped my speed
and cautiously followed the trail
of my headlights forward into the
mist. The road dipped and rose,
following the crest of a levee.
A '69 Chevy sat parked by a
"Wharf — 200 ft." sign; I pulled
up behind it.
"I'll stay and guard the car,"
said Reed. "These hallucinations
can be larcenous."
"Yuh, sure," I replied, slam
ming the door.
The opposite shore wasn't
visible from where we stood, but
as I grew accustomed to the
gloom, I saw The River, running
low over white sand thirty feet
below the levee. A splash
prompted me to resume the quest
and I followed the sound duti
fully, following the road, sloping
down towards the water.
Two of them, a male and a
female, both nude. They had
been taking turns diving off the
long wooden pier at the end of
the levee road, but as I ap
proached, they stood together,
expectantly.
The male waved and intro
duced himself ("Mary") and his
girlfriend ("Mary").
"Oh, wow, you have the same
names," I tried real hard to keep
the sarcasm to a manageable
level. "We're kinda lost. Could
you give us some directions on
how to get out of Arkansas?"
"Sure," replied the male.
"Wait for the steamship."
"Steamship?"
"Yeah, it'll be by in a coupla
minutes, ties up right here." He
pointed his chin at the edge of the
dock.
"I was kinda hoping that we
could drive outta here, like on
66."
"66?" they both exclaimed, si
multaneously and broke into the
same kind of fit as the Shaky
Hand attendant. I hoped that the
female would keep laughing, but
that was another set of points.
"You could drive 66 the rest of
your life and never leave
Arkansas," she was saying. "It's
not really a steamer anyway; it's
more like a car ferry. Just drive
down to the edge of the ramp."
Once again, the whole deal was
gratis.
"We're outta here," I said,
opening the door and shaking
Reed's shoulder. "Wake up."
"I wish I was," yawned Reed.
"So did you find the off switch?"
"Better; we've got a ride on a
riverboat." I started the car.
"There's that," she settled back
to resume her nap. The car
coughed and died.
"No gas?"
"Plenty of gas," I was puzzled.
"Well, it's all downhill from here.
Gimme a push, willya?"
"No problem." Reed slipped
out the door and shoved the car,
which responded by ramming the
Chevy, which proceeded to roll
down the ramp, disappearing into
the mist. There was a twin shout,
then a loud splash.
"Nice," yelled Reed. The fog
began to thin by leaps and
bounds. We watched as The
River appeared in splendor. From
around the downriver bend, as
advertised, the steamship, a Mis
sissippi paddlewheeler with two
black stacks billowing smoke,
glided majestically through the
sunset, finally stopping a few
yards from the wharf. A deck
hand threw a lasso over the tie-up
piling and the naked Marys
(whom I guessed we missed with
the Chevy) secured the line. The
male waved his arm and a great

wooden ramp crashed onto the
wharf from the ship.
"That's our cue," I yelled back
and Reed gave another shove.
They told me later that the whole
event took exactly three minutes
from Reed's push to the last hub
cap falling into place. In between,
I discovered that my brakes had
failed, plunged headlong into the
ship's pitch-black superstructure
and came to a halt by plowing
broadside through a dozen
vintage automobiles.
Surprised over my bodily unity,
I sat in the dark wreckage mo
tionless as the overhead lights
came on. My car had attempted
some form of intercourse with a
'58 Cadillac and I pulled myself
free from that blasphemous un
ion. Reed and the deckhand
sauntered over.
"Go ahead," I wheezed. "Go
ahead, girl, have a laugh on me."
She did; she is not a subtle per

"B Deck; he's waiting to see
you." We followed the deckhand
up a flight of stairs to an im
pressively picture-windowed
room. An enormous man with a

coming up on a "The Queen

Loves All You Wharf Rats" sign,
always returning to 66.
Everybody we met was invariably
affable, generous to a fault (1
suspected that they probably
would've given us that as well),
and named "Mary", even the os
tensibly male individuals.
"This is a hallucination, and
not a particularly pleasant one at
that," stated Reed, after a burly
lumberjack ("Call m'self Mary up
'round these parts") had been
completely, utterly and unfail
ingly unhelpful about local geog
raphy, except for mentioning "the
river" and how much we'd like it
there, and handing us
mimeographed copies of the
"Wharf Rat" sign.
"Maybe there's a Triple A
there or something," I said,
driving into the late afternoon
sun. Every object had a pretty
purple shadow.
"I was hoping for a beach
party," offered Reed.
"You're nothing but a party,
girl."
"That's party vegetable to you,
sir," snapped Reed. "Hey," she
pointed to a sign, "there's 'The
River' exit."
Capital-The Capital-River exit
seemed to be no different from
the hundreds we'd already tried,
except for the moor-like fog that
descended on us moments after
we'd left 66. I dropped my speed
and cautiously followed the trail
of my headlights forward into the
mist. The road dipped and rose,
following the crest of a levee.
A '69 Chevy sat parked by a
"Wharf — 200 ft." sign; I pulled
up behind it.
"I'll stay and guard the car,"
said Reed. "These hallucinations
can be larcenous."
"Yuh, sure," I replied, slam
ming the door.
The opposite shore wasn't
visible from where we stood, but
as I grew accustomed to the
gloom, I saw The River, running
low over white sand thirty feet
below the levee. A splash
prompted me to resume the quest
and I followed the sound duti
fully, following the road, sloping
down towards the water.
Two of them, a male and a
female, both nude. They had
been taking turns diving off the
long wooden pier at the end of
the levee road, but as I ap
proached, they stood together,
expectantly.
The male waved and intro
duced himself ("Mary") and his
girlfriend ("Mary").
"Oh, wow, you have the same
names," I tried real hard to keep
the sarcasm to a manageable
level. "We're kinda lost. Could
you give us some directions on
how to get out of Arkansas?"
"Sure," replied the male.
"Wait for the steamship."
"Steamship?"
"Yeah, it'll be by in a coupla
minutes, ties up right here." He
pointed his chin at the edge of the
dock.
"I was kinda hoping that we
could drive outta here, like on
66."
"66?" they both exclaimed, si
multaneously and broke into the
same kind of fit as the Shaky
Hand attendant. I hoped that the
female would keep laughing, but
that was another set of points.
"You could drive 66 the rest of
your life and never leave
Arkansas," she was saying. "It's
not really a steamer anyway; it's
more like a car ferry. Just drive
down to the edge of the ramp."
Once again, the whole deal was
gratis.
"We're outta here," I said,
opening the door and shaking
Reed's shoulder. "Wake up."
"I wish I was," yawned Reed.
"So did you find the off switch?"
"Better; we've got a ride on a
riverboat." I started the car.
"There's that," she settled back
to resume her nap. The car
coughed and died.
"No gas?"
"Plenty of gas," I was puzzled.
"Well, it's all downhill from here.
Gimme a push, willya?"
"No problem." Reed slipped
out the door and shoved the car,
which responded by ramming the
Chevy, which proceeded to roll
down the ramp, disappearing into
the mist. There was a twin shout,
then a loud splash.
"Nice," yelled Reed. The fog
began to thin by leaps and
bounds. We watched as The
River appeared in splendor. From
around the downriver bend, as
advertised, the steamship, a Mis
sissippi paddlewheeler with two
black stacks billowing smoke,
glided majestically through the
sunset, finally stopping a few
yards from the wharf. A deck
hand threw a lasso over the tie-up
piling and the naked Marys
(whom I guessed we missed with
the Chevy) secured the line. The
male waved his arm and a great

wooden ramp crashed onto the
wharf from the ship.
"That's our cue," I yelled back
and Reed gave another shove.
They told me later that the whole
event took exactly three minutes
from Reed's push to the last hub
cap falling into place. In between,
I discovered that my brakes had
failed, plunged headlong into the
ship's pitch-black superstructure
and came to a halt by plowing
broadside through a dozen
vintage automobiles.
Surprised over my bodily unity,
I sat in the dark wreckage mo
tionless as the overhead lights
came on. My car had attempted
some form of intercourse with a
'58 Cadillac and I pulled myself
free from that blasphemous un
ion. Reed and the deckhand
sauntered over.
"Go ahead," I wheezed. "Go
ahead, girl, have a laugh on me."
She did; she is not a subtle per
son.
"B Deck; he's waiting to see
you." We followed the deckhand
up a flight of stairs to an im
pressively picture-windowed
room. An enormous man with a
captain's cap, puffing on a pipe
with one hand and holding the
ship's wheel with the other,
turned towards us.
"No, my name isn't Mary, at
least not yet!" he grinned ef
fusively. "Every newcomer asks
that question first. The only Mary
around here's this dame," he
knocked on the wheel, "the
Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Welcome to the Queen Mary; I'm
the captain. Bill Sunset."
"So you're the two we pulled
off of 101," he waited until we
nodded. "I suppose you're won
derin' how you got here and how
you're gettin out. The answer to
the second question is T don't
know' and the answer to the
first's the story of how I got
here." He turned back to the
wheel, motioning us to sit on the
back bench.
"That's my '63 Mercury you
trashed down there, by the way.
The junk folks drive these days, 1
don't see how you can sit in 'em."
He relit his pipe.
"I wasn't always the captain of
a steamer, y'know," he began. "I
started off as a folk singer, not
anywhere you ever heard of. I
was seventeen, it was '65, 1 had a
car and I had a guitar. The neces
sities, y'know. I knew someday
I'd go to New York or L.A. and

make it big, like Dylan or some
thing, but back then, I was havin'
a good time playin' the bars and
local college scene, doin' mostly
my own stuff. I was pretty good at
it.
"Well, things being the way
they were, I got married to the
most fascinatin', beautiful woman
in the world." He paused to give
the wheel a tug to the right. "She
was perfect, except for this one
bad habit; she loved to waste
time. Not only her time, but
everyone around her's too. It
started off slow, like I'd be try in'
to figure out a song and she'd say
'Honey, couldja refill the condi
ment rack?' or' Billy, couldja help
me pull the weeds?'
"These little things got bigger
and bigger, only I didn't figure it
out, 'til one day, I discovered that
I was thirty-five years old and
hadn't done a damn thing I
wanted to do before I met her.
That same day, my wife left. Now,
you'd figure good riddance to bad
rubbish.
"But it wasn't like that. I
thought I'd have all the time in
the world to do all the important
stuff I'd put off, but I ended up
sittin' around the house, makin'
sure the condiment racks were
full and all the weeds were pulled.
"So one day, about a year ago,
I was out drivin', pretty de
pressed, when I got onto Route
66 and ended up here.
"To make it short, 1 found my
wife livin' not too far from here
on The River, at the end of this
run. I moved in with her and set
this ship up as a sorta immigrant
assistance center. I get home
every day about five and we
spend an enjoyable evening fillin'
salt shakers and pullin' dan
delions.
"I think you know what my
wife's name is."
"So why aren't you a Mary?"
asked Reed.
"Oh, that," puffed the Captain,
"I'm still new here. Y'see, most
everyone around here wasn't
called Mary to begin with, just
that their original name wasn't
their real name, y'know what I
mean? I expect one of these days,
I'll forget to call myself'Bill'."
Reed went downstairs to sit on
the prow and watch the wake of
the ship. I suspect she's come to
the same decision I came to. I ap
proached the Captain to ask if he
needed another hand, because I
was home, waiting for Mary. ■
