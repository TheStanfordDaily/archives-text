# Rally raps plight of Soviet Jews
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Staff writer 
Blasting the Soviet government's
continued persecution of Jewish
"refuseniks" who have been denied
exit visas from their country, speakers
at a White Plaza rally yesterday said
the Stanford community can "make a
difference" by sending protest letters
to Soviet authorities.
Rabbi Douglas Kahn of San Fran
cisco said demonstrations remind So
viet leaders that violations of basic
human rights are not being ignored in
the outside world. "Without our
protests, the Soviet regime would be
even more brutal," Kahn said.
Hillel Rabbi Ari Cartun, who or
ganized the rally, told a lunchtime
crowd, "If you want to teach Hebrew
(in the Soviet Union), you will be ar
rested." In addition to arrests, Mi
chael Coran, a law school student and
Hillel member, said refuseniks are
routinely subjected to other forms of
intimidation, including apartment
searches.
The rally, one of many taking place
in the West this month to protest So
viet human rights violations, was
timed to coincide with next week's
celebration of Passover, according to
Rabbi Cartun. Passover annually

marks the exodus of Moses and the
Jews from Egypt.
In an apparent allusion to the
White Plaza shanty and "graveyard,"
which were built by members of Stan
ford Out of South Africa and Sanctu
ary at Stanford to protest government
policies in South Africa and Central
America, Coran said the place of the
rally was also "appropriate."
During the rally, Hillel members
were encouraging supporters to ad
dress Passover cards to Soviet
refuseniks. According to freshman
Naomi Robinson, Hillel receives a list
of Soviet Jews who have applied for
exit visas and been denied.
In addition to the speakers. Soviet
emigre Misha Yagudin played the
guitar and sang three songs, including
"Let My People Go."
Yagudin, who was forced to wait
two years for permission to emigrate,
said his own time as a refusenik was
relatively brief. In order to get a visa,
he moved from Leningrad to the Lith
uanian city of Kaunas, where he was
told by friends that permission to
leave would be easier to receive.
"The local government (in Lith
uania) sympathizes with Jews," he
said. One of the 15 Soviet republics,
Lithuania has been occupied by So
viet forces since World War 11.
