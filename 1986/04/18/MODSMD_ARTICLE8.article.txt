# Drell praises Soviet dissident Sakharov

### STACY SIMON 
Calling Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov "a
prophet without honor in his own country,"
physicist Sidney Drell told a small Toyon audience
last night that Sakharov would go down in history
as a hero alongside Ghandi and Martin Luther
King Jr.
Drell, deputy director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) and co-director of the
Stanford Center for International Security and
Arms Control, has been an outspoken critic of the
Soviet government's treatment of Sakharov.
Called "the conscience of mankind" by the com
mittee that awarded him a Nobel Peace Prize in
1975, Sakharov has been exiled to the Soviet city of
Gorky for the past six years. Drell said the Soviet
government has never given Sakharov a trial, but
considers him a dissident for holding protests and
vigils in defense of human rights and writing on the
perils of the nuclear age.
"I have an image of Sakharov as a two-fisted

fighter," said Drell, "because he speaks out on the
dangers of weapons and on human rights."
Drell first met Sakharov at a physicists' conven
tion in the Soviet Union in 1974 and saw him last at
a conference in 1976. Although they have com
municated only through the mail since then, Drell
said, "I am honored to consider myself a close
friend of his."
Drell said that because of Sakharov's role as
"father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb," he felt an
obligation to support human rights. In 1975, Sak
harov's wife, Dr. Yelena Bonner, accepted the
Nobel Peace Prize on her husband's behalf. Sak
harov did not attend because of his role in a protest
aimed at assisting Jewish "refuseniks" and other
dissidents to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
As part of his continuing protests, Sakharov has
gone on several hunger strikes. His most recent
strike ended when Soviet officials gave Bonner
permission to travel to Italy and the United States
for medical treatment.
According to Drell, Bonner chose to come to the

West for treatment because she did not trust Soviet
doctors who have force-fed her husband during his
hunger strikes, and because the United States has
more advanced medical technology.
When Bonner visited Stanford in February, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy reissued an of
fer for Sakharov to teach here. Drell said that every
major university in the United States would give
Sakharov a job. "Any university that wouldn't give
him an offer, by definition, isn't major," he said.
He said the Soviet Union is harming its reputa
tion in the world by isolating Sakharov, adding that
the most important way to help Sakharov is to ex
press support for him and his causes.
Drell said Stanford's notoriety offers a form of
protection for Sakharov.
"It's very important that the Soviets know that
people here have not forgotten or abandoned him
and that they're paying a price by the way they're
treating him," Drell said. "They just can t do it for
free."
