### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
In a vote of confidence in current party guidelines,
the Interfraternity Council (IFC) decided last night to
continue serving alcohol at Rush parties, according to
IFC President Don Galles.
The decision followed an incident last week in which
freshman David Curry was allegedly assaulted by two
other freshmen after the three attended Rush parties.
According the Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
the three were "quite drunk" at the time of the inci
dent.
As expected, Stanford police filed felony battery
charges yesterday against freshman Bill McKelvy and
Randy Von Feldt with the Santa Clara County District
Attorney.
"The IFC party guidelines are stricter and more ex

plicit than the University (guidelines)" Galles said,
adding that if fraternities follow the guidelines, "you're
not going to have problems."
According to Galles, the IFC is currently conducting
an investigation of last week's incident aimed at
detemining whether IFC party guidelines were fol
lowed. If so, the IFC "needs to make some real
changes"; if not, "There will be a fairly severe
response," Galles said.
The IFC report will be released Tuesday or Wednes
day of next week, and the final decision concerning al
cohol and Rush will be made at that time, Galles said.
The University suspended Rush activities of the
Delta Upsilon fraternity on Tuesday after it was deter
mined that the freshmen involved in the assault of
Curry were drinking with DU members shortly before
the altercation, according to Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano.
