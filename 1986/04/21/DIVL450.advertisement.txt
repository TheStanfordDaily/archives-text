American/Iberian culture even though it will not be

Fellow, Edmundo Fuenzalida, looks forward to
sharing his expertise in Latin American/Iberian history
and culture with all residents of the house. In
addition to continuing the varied house programs

plan cultural events that include music, dance (such
as the Samba and the Tango), and modern Latin
American painting. Through various house activities,
