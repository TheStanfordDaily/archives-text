### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Students elected "The Real Solution" to the Council of
Presidents (COP), approved divestment and sanctuary
referendums, voted for all but five special fee requests and
defeated a proposed constitution, according to prelimi
nary results from the ASSU elections.
Results of races for ASSU Senate and senior class presi
dent will he announced this afternoon. All results will be
final Saturday when overseas and absentee ballots are
tabulated.
In the race for COP, "The Real Solution" defeated
"Josh," 2,60! to 1,365. The members of the victorious
slate are juniors Carey White and Kim Crawford, and
sophomores Rudy Fuentes and Mary Thurber.
"I'm happy and I hope I can start working right away as
a COP member-elect," Thurber said.
The new COP's main goals according to Thurber are
"making it easier for groups to get money" through the
funding process, "more participation" on ASSU commit
tees, and changing the Western Culture program to one
covering world culture.
Voters passed all association fee requests except for
those requested by the Boathouse Party Area; The Stan
ford Daily, Part II (Reserves); the Glee Club; the March
ing Band, Part II (the trip); and both parts of the All
Campus Party Fund.
The results show that by a margin of 2,524-1,875, stu-

in the effort to declare her house house a sanctuary, said
the election "symbolically shows the mentality of the
people here at Stanford."
Student support for the Stanford sanctuary movement

"gives a lot of credibility" to the activities of those stu
dents currently involved in the movement, and is helpful
to other students for whom popular support may be an
impetus to make a strong commitment to the movement,
Paul added.
By a ratio slightly higher than two-to-one (2.935-
1.42 I), voters also passed a referendum which calls on the
University to "make an immediate commitment to totally
divest within a specified time frame from all companies
doing business in South Africa under apartheid laws."
Black Student Union President Steve Phillips said the
vote's high ratio is "definitely a mandate (that) reconfirms
that divestment is the correct action to take."
"It will serve to show whether the University is a demo
cratic place or not," Phillips said. He implied that the Uni
versity administration's disregard of the election result
would prove that students have no say in this type of Uni
versity policy.
Although preliminary results of the undergraduate sen
ate race were announced Saturday afternoon, reliable
results will not be available until late this afternoon. Ac
cording to ASSU Elections Commissioner Robin Miller,
1,000 of the Scantron ballots were not counted in the first
results because the coding that shows the voter's class
standing was not filled in darkly enough, so the Scantron
machine would not count them.
The Elections Commission was able to take the results
of issues and fees from these ballots, but a
thousand votes still need to be allocated to un
dergraduate senate candidates.
Receiving a vote of 2,581 in favor and 1,426
opposed, the proposed new ASSU constitution
failed once again, receiving less ttfan the two
thirds majority needed for approval.
White, who edited the proposed constitution,
said the second defeat signals to the constitu
tion's authors that "we need to step back and
take a longer view of what changes are neces
sary in the current constitution.
"Honestly, it's not the words of the constitu

tion that matter, it's the people who are in the
senate," White said. Citing "much more vital"
issues, such as the Western Culture-World Cul
ture conflict, building a new student union and
such student movements as sanctuary and di
vestment, White admitted he does not plan to
attempt another constitution either as senate
chair or as a member of the COP.
All three constitutional amendments on the
ballot passed, receiving votes of approval from
at least two-thirds of the voting students.
Amendment 4 modifies the process by which
amendments to the ASSU Constitution are
placed on the ballot. Amendment 5 modifies
Article VI of the Constitution, which deals with
initiative, referendum and recall. Amendment 6
allows students to set the Association Fee each
year.
