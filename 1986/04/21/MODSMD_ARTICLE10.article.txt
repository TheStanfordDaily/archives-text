# Miler talks on records

### JOHN POLLACK 
"Anatomy is clearly not the most important
factor" in separating the "superlative" from the
"average" athlete, Sir Roger Bannister told an
audience of about 60 people at Tresidder Friday
night.
Bannister, now master of Pembroke College
at Oxford, was the first man to break the four
minute mile when he raced to a 3:59.4 on May
6, 1954.
Speaking on "Sports and Medicine â€” The
Ritual of Records," Bannister acknowledged
that while "it will get physically difficult if run
ners get down to three and a half minutes [for
the mile]," he said there is "no real limit to
human achievement."
Although there is constant pressure on ath

letes to set new records. Bannister downplayed
the importance of records. "The outcome is
more important than the time," he said.
While world records are out of reach for most
people. Bannister commented on the "heart
warming spontaneity" of the fitness craze in this
country and lauded the "shift to participation"
evident today.
Bannister said exercise should be "liberating,
not oppressive," and said the integration of
"body and brain" which comes from sport "is
deeply a part of our nature without which life is
'diminished.' "
However, while discussing "the darker side"
of athletics, Bannister said since drug use
among athletes is "extremely difficult to con
trol," he is in favor of random drug-testing of
athletes to "keep one step ahead of the cheats."
