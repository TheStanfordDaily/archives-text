## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Attack will fuel terror 
### 
Even as most Americans react with proud satisfac
tion to last week's air attack on Libya, it is already be
coming painfully clear that the raid was a serious
mistake — one that will likely fuel, rather than stem
the rise of international terrorism.
President Reagan, the morning after the attack,
reassured the nation that "this mission, violent though
it was, can bring closer a safer and more secure world
for decent men and women." Unfortunately, reality in
dicates otherwise. Far from spooking Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Khadafy and the terrorists he sup
posedly controls into submission, our violent attack on
Libyan cities will undoubtedly provoke a desire for
revenge and drive them to further acts of brutality.
Tragically, evidence of a terrorist escalation began to
appear almost as soon as U.S. bombs stopped falling in
Tripoli and Benghazi. Early last week the bodies of
two kidnapped Englishmen and one American were
discovered near Beirut. In the Sudan, a U.S. communi
cations technician was shot Wednesday, forcing a par
tial evacuation of the U.S. embassy there. And on
Thursday, a bomb was found in the carry-on luggage of
a woman about to board an El Al flight from London
to Tel Aviv.
Although Khadafy's government is unquestionably
an aggressive and disruptive force in world politics, it is
not at all clear that a military attack against it was the
only option open to the Reagan Administration. Multi
lateral economic sanctions, while admittedly difficult
to orchestrate, might yet have been achieved had the
United States not been so quick to send in the
bombers. On Monday, the very day of the attack, U.S.

United Nations Ambassador Vernon Walters was in
Europe trying to work out concerted allied sanctions
against Libya.
Having once launched a violent reprisal against
Libya, the United States has effectively denied itself
the option of ever again returning to a non-violent
response to terrorism. When Libya, or Libyan
sponsored terrorists strike next, the Reagan Adminis
tration will have no recourse but to respond once again
with military force. Anything less would almost cer
tainly be perceived as a Libyan victory. Where will
such an escalating spiral of attack and reprisal end? We
must ask ourselves if our national pride is worth such
stubborn commitment to violence and bloodshed.
In light of recent events, it would be all too easy to
assume that Libya is somehow responsible for most
Middle Eastern terrorism. Although Libya's role in
fostering terrorist activities has certainly been a large
one, it would be a gross oversimplification to think that
an attack on Libya is an attack on the roots of ter
rorism. Only some of the many Middle Eastern terror
ist groups are controlled, or even influenced, by Libya.
Far from wiping out Middle Eastern terrorism, attack
ing Libya will only serve to unite and galvanize terror
ist fanatics throughout the Arab world.
The bombing of Libya was a quick answer to a com
plicated problem. This violent reprisal, good as it may
have felt to Americans frustrated by unpunished ter
rorism, will likely do more harm than good. Sadly, the
United States may find that it has mired itself in a
bloody cycle of growing terrorist violence.
The bombs have fallen, but the problems remain.
