Shantytown is not
helping any blacks
White Plaza is no place for
eyesores like the "shantytown" or the
"graveyard." What right does Stan
ford out of South Africa (SOSA)
have to defile our campus with that
collection of garbage? What right
does SAS (Sanctuary at Stanford)
have to create such a morbid atmos
phere in the heart of campus? If it is
their right to dump in White Plaza be
cause they want to remind us of suf
fering, is it not also our right to want
to see it removed because it is ugly
and causes us suffering? The issue
here is that it is neither SOSA's nor
SAS's right to inflict this ugliness
upon the Stanford community.
Freedom of speech is one thing, but
to have to be subjected to the rot in
White Plaza day after day is taking
this too far. Furthermore, it is an em
barrassment when visitors to the
Stanford community identify these
abominations with us. Besides, the
shantytown is a proven fire hazard.
Let it be made perfectly clear that
we in no way support apartheid, but
we fail to see how the shantytown
aids a single oppressed South African
black in any way. We also question
the dedication of SOSA members
who sit out in front of the shantytown
the third week of spring quarter.
Where were they five weeks ago
during Finals, or during the torrential
downpours of winter quarter, or
during spring break? If the SOSA
members' convictions were as strong
as they would have us believe, they
would not carry them through so half
heartedly.
Controversy is not something to be

cultivated for its own sake. In fact, we
would not put it past SOSA, in their
seemingly insatiable quest for
publicity, to set Fire to the shantytown
themselves. After all, it is about time
for a new ploy. Reading about sleep
ins in the Quad, sit-ins at Old Union
and laying down under trustees' cars
has thoroughly bored everyone.
If the members of SOSA were
really dedicated, they would, upon
realizing Stanford's unwillingness to
divest, do us all a favor and divest
themselves from Stanford. They
should transfer to a school that has
divested and send their tuition
savings to Bishop Tutu, so they can fi
nally succeed in furthering their
cause. Instead they remain here, wal
lowing in their own hypocrisy, and
continue to receive an education
funded by what they believe to be
"sin money," derived from the
oppression of South African blacks.
In regards to the other recent un
sightly addition to White Plaza, a
more appropriate place for our new
"graveyard" might be the front lawn
of Columbae. White Plaza is a place
for free speech, but it is not free
speech to subject people to that rot
ting trash day in and day out as they
go to the Bookstore, Post Office or
class.

Stories differ on
films' cancellation
On Tuesday night, April 15, I as
well as about 100 other students went

to Cubberley Auditorium in hopes of
watching "Night and Fog" (a film
depicting Nazi war atrocities) and
"Last Grave at Dimbaza" (a film
depicting the apartheid policies of
South Africa). Instead of the films we
got to hear a short, rather fishy
sounding monologue from Eric Die
sel, the Tuesday Film Series coordin
ator. He told us that "Night and Fog''
had been received and then sent back
without his permission. He spec
ulated that a Stanford employee un
der pressure from University officials
had returned it thinking it was the
South African film. He also said that
he could not show the South African
film which he had in his possession
because the projectionist had not
shown up. He hypothesized that the
University had again applied pressure
to dissuade the projectionist from
showing up due to the anti-apartheid
nature of the film.
Like I said, the story seemed kind
of fishy so I went to see Gloria
Johnston in the Student Organization
Services (SOS) office. She had quite a
different and more believable story to
tell. It seems that Diesel had ne
glected to make the necessary ar
rangements for the payment of the
COD for the film rental so it was sent
back. Also, it seems that Diesel had
failed to fill out and send in a facilities
usage form in time, and so he had not
officially reserved Cubberley
Auditorium or a projectionist fpr
Tuesday night. Johnston's story was
further confirmed by conversations
with members of The Daily staff who
knew of similar incidents in the past
when Diesel had failed to comply
with simple University policies and
deadlines.
