# Rethink political realities
## 
### 
When I was a child, I went to a Catholic kindergarten
for a year. It was, I suppose, the typical Catholic pre
school experience: uniforms, rote learning, stern nuns and
an occasional rap across the knuckles with a very long and
very wooden ruler. The nuns, it seemed, were not terribly
fond of little boys who erased; they would instruct us to
copy letters and words from the blackboard into our
notebooks, making it quite clear that erasure was not to
be tolerated. Generally I obeyed. Sometimes, though, 1
couldn't help myself; sometimes my scribbling just didn't
look the way I wanted it to, and 1 had to erase. And
sometimes, I got slapped on the hands with a ruler. I al
ways knew when it was coming. The punishment seemed

inevitable, even justified, given the very clear rules we
were obliged to follow. The nuns were not being mali
cious; they were simply teaching me by tried and
presumably true methods. The methods didn't work; I
continued to erase, never once understanding why
erasures were so offensive in the first place. The real les
son was a lingering feeling that there was something fun
damentally wrong with the justice 1 was compelled to
endure. The nuns felt they had to take the actions they
did; I accepted their authority, and the rules they
imposed. Yet, then and now, it seemed so ludicrous, so
absolutely antiquated, and so ultimately ineffective.
Which brings me, in a very convoluted way, to the
recent U.S. bombing of Libya. News of the raid hit me like
the nuns' ruler used to hit my knuckles — as an expected,
justified, reasonable and utterly inane act. I am not cas
ting Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy as an innocent
5-year-old punished for harmless erasures; nor does the
idea of President Reagan in a nun's habit contribute much
to an analysis of the present crisis. But like the reverend
sisters of my year in kindergarten hell, Reagan acted
against Libya on the basis of assumptions and beliefs that,
by their inherent limitations, prevented him from cor
rectly assessing and confronting the problem before him.
In his first inaugural address, Reagan promised "swift
and effective retribution" for acts of terrorism against the
United States — an appealing if rather simplistic senti
ment with which most of us could agree in the aftermath
of the traumatic Iranian hostage crisis. Apart from the
rage and frustration we naturally feel watching civilians
slaughtered, our conception of international political
reality intuitively demands that the United States retaliate
against terrorism. As the predominant world power, the
United States cannot afford to allow its diplomats, sol
diers, citizens and — indirectly — its political interests to
be willfully threatened by other nations if it desires to
maintain its power and influence in the world. As this line
of thinking goes, reluctance to send our young men to
their possible deaths should not weaken our resolve to
protect national interests. When the enemy is clear (and it
would seem, from many accounts, that the link between

Khadafy and the Berlin disco bombing was well substan
tiated), when nonviolent remedies have been exhausted
(economic sanctions, attempts to impose joint pressure
with European allies, muscle-flexing — all failed), and
when the aims are limited and accessible (if nothing else,
the raid does serve notice to Khadafy that sponsoring ter
rorist action is not cost free), military actions like the
bombing raid are the best possible alternative.
Or so it would appear. And yet, by and large, people
have responded to the raid with ambivalence. The faces of
the Stanford students I saw crowded around dorm televi
sion sets Monday evening were neither jubilant nor in
censed; instead, they were concerned and slightly
confused. Their reaction was reflected in the political
mainstream's cautious, conditional approval. Beneath the
usual calls to rally behind the president flowed an under
current of doubt and unease. The reason for this tentative,
tepid domestic support for an action which would appear
to be fully in accord with the foreign policy principles
most Americans seem to embrace is simple: The raid will
most likely prove ineffective in the long run. It is evident
to nearly everyone that bombing alleged terrorist training
camps in Tripoli and Benghazi will do little more than give
Arab terrorists a temporary setback, and that the raid may
in fact make terrorists more determined and more likely
to commit acts of carnage against Americans abroad and,
perhaps, in the United States itself. As is often said and
often ignored, military retaliation does not begin to strike
at the roots of terrorism and thus cannot make a substan
tial contribution to eradicating it.
Clearly, there is something flawed, something funda
mentally wrong, with a logic that leads us to take actions
that do little or nothing to even begin solving the problem
the actions are meant to address. Clearly we must re
examine the logic and the assumptions underlying it in or
derttrcortstiui'l UTTOTngf, more effective, way to look at m
ternational politics. House Republican Leader Robert
Michel of Illinois described the U.S. bombing as a skir
mish in "a new kind of war." Indeed it is. It is a new kind
of war for a new kind of world, a world of rapidly advanc
ing technology, of unprecedented economic interdepen
dence, of communication systems that are transforming
the planet into a global village — in short, a world very
different from the one in which the theories that guide the
Reagan Administration's foreign policy were formulated.
The prevailing view that some form of military retaliation
against Libya was necessary and inevitable, that the raid
was in fact forced upon us by Khadafy's actions, rests
upon the false assumption that we live in a world where
such a conception of international political realities has
meaning. We do not live in such a world, however, and we
must therefore construct and act upon a new conception
or find ourselves fighting a rearguard, reactive battle
which we will inevitably lose.
The current generation of political leaders, wedded to
stagnant, outmoded mindsets and hemmed in by powerful
political pressures, may not be able to meet the challenge.
It falls to our generation to shrug off the blinders of con
vention and find a new way to look at the world. The un
pleasant alternative is to fill the role of the kindergarten
nuns — to cling to aged and sterile ways, to take actions
destined to fail, to be remembered only as a quaint, sad
monument to futility and error.

did; I accepted their authority, and the rules they
imposed. Yet, then and now, it seemed so ludicrous, so
absolutely antiquated, and so ultimately ineffective.
Which brings me, in a very convoluted way, to the
recent U.S. bombing of Libya. News of the raid hit me like
the nuns' ruler used to hit my knuckles — as an expected,
justified, reasonable and utterly inane act. I am not cas
ting Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy as an innocent
5-year-old punished for harmless erasures; nor does the
idea of President Reagan in a nun's habit contribute much
to an analysis of the present crisis. But like the reverend
sisters of my year in kindergarten hell, Reagan acted
against Libya on the basis of assumptions and beliefs that,
by their inherent limitations, prevented him from cor
rectly assessing and confronting the problem before him.
In his first inaugural address, Reagan promised "swift
and effective retribution" for acts of terrorism against the
United States — an appealing if rather simplistic senti
ment with which most of us could agree in the aftermath
of the traumatic Iranian hostage crisis. Apart from the
rage and frustration we naturally feel watching civilians
slaughtered, our conception of international political
reality intuitively demands that the United States retaliate
against terrorism. As the predominant world power, the
United States cannot afford to allow its diplomats, sol
diers, citizens and — indirectly — its political interests to
be willfully threatened by other nations if it desires to
maintain its power and influence in the world. As this line
of thinking goes, reluctance to send our young men to
their possible deaths should not weaken our resolve to
protect national interests. When the enemy is clear (and it
would seem, from many accounts, that the link between

Khadafy and the Berlin disco bombing was well substan
tiated), when nonviolent remedies have been exhausted
(economic sanctions, attempts to impose joint pressure
with European allies, muscle-flexing — all failed), and
when the aims are limited and accessible (if nothing else,
the raid does serve notice to Khadafy that sponsoring ter
rorist action is not cost free), military actions like the
bombing raid are the best possible alternative.
Or so it would appear. And yet, by and large, people
have responded to the raid with ambivalence. The faces of
the Stanford students I saw crowded around dorm televi
sion sets Monday evening were neither jubilant nor in
censed; instead, they were concerned and slightly
confused. Their reaction was reflected in the political
mainstream's cautious, conditional approval. Beneath the
usual calls to rally behind the president flowed an under
current of doubt and unease. The reason for this tentative,
tepid domestic support for an action which would appear
to be fully in accord with the foreign policy principles
most Americans seem to embrace is simple: The raid will
most likely prove ineffective in the long run. It is evident
to nearly everyone that bombing alleged terrorist training
camps in Tripoli and Benghazi will do little more than give
Arab terrorists a temporary setback, and that the raid may
in fact make terrorists more determined and more likely
to commit acts of carnage against Americans abroad and,
perhaps, in the United States itself. As is often said and
often ignored, military retaliation does not begin to strike
at the roots of terrorism and thus cannot make a substan
tial contribution to eradicating it.
Clearly, there is something flawed, something funda
mentally wrong, with a logic that leads us to take actions
that do little or nothing to even begin solving the problem
the actions are meant to address. Clearly we must re
examine the logic and the assumptions underlying it in or
derttrcortstiui'l UTTOTngf, more effective, way to look at m
ternational politics. House Republican Leader Robert
Michel of Illinois described the U.S. bombing as a skir
mish in "a new kind of war." Indeed it is. It is a new kind
of war for a new kind of world, a world of rapidly advanc
ing technology, of unprecedented economic interdepen
dence, of communication systems that are transforming
the planet into a global village — in short, a world very
different from the one in which the theories that guide the
Reagan Administration's foreign policy were formulated.
The prevailing view that some form of military retaliation
against Libya was necessary and inevitable, that the raid
was in fact forced upon us by Khadafy's actions, rests
upon the false assumption that we live in a world where
such a conception of international political realities has
meaning. We do not live in such a world, however, and we
must therefore construct and act upon a new conception
or find ourselves fighting a rearguard, reactive battle
which we will inevitably lose.
The current generation of political leaders, wedded to
stagnant, outmoded mindsets and hemmed in by powerful
political pressures, may not be able to meet the challenge.
It falls to our generation to shrug off the blinders of con
vention and find a new way to look at the world. The un
pleasant alternative is to fill the role of the kindergarten
nuns — to cling to aged and sterile ways, to take actions
destined to fail, to be remembered only as a quaint, sad
monument to futility and error.

When I was a child, I went to a Catholic kindergarten
for a year. It was, I suppose, the typical Catholic pre
school experience: uniforms, rote learning, stern nuns and
an occasional rap across the knuckles with a very long and
very wooden ruler. The nuns, it seemed, were not terribly
fond of little boys who erased; they would instruct us to
copy letters and words from the blackboard into our
notebooks, making it quite clear that erasure was not to
be tolerated. Generally I obeyed. Sometimes, though, 1
couldn't help myself; sometimes my scribbling just didn't
look the way I wanted it to, and 1 had to erase. And
sometimes, I got slapped on the hands with a ruler. I al
ways knew when it was coming. The punishment seemed

inevitable, even justified, given the very clear rules we
were obliged to follow. The nuns were not being mali
cious; they were simply teaching me by tried and
presumably true methods. The methods didn't work; I
continued to erase, never once understanding why
erasures were so offensive in the first place. The real les
son was a lingering feeling that there was something fun
damentally wrong with the justice 1 was compelled to
endure. The nuns felt they had to take the actions they
did; I accepted their authority, and the rules they
imposed. Yet, then and now, it seemed so ludicrous, so
