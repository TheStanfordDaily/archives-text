## ASSU needs new electoral system 
### 
I don't know if you all noticed it, but this quar
ter's ASSU Senate election was infested by two
very pernicious, and more importantly, very irritat
ing species. The first was the big, bold and empty
kind. "VOTE FOR ME," their fliers read. They
accosted one in the street (if such a thing can be
said to exist at Stanford) and in one's room. No

place was safe from their depredations. I cannot
help but wonder what drives these individuals to af
front my intelligence and solicit my vote in this
fashion. Most probably, they are fuzzy majors in
terested in corporate careers in marketing, sales or,
perhaps (ah. that elusive thing . . .). an entry-level
management position, blessed be its name. Maybe
they hope to get that something extra out of the
ASSU — something that will place them above
everybody else in the race for the corporate toe
hold and eventual yuppiedom. Their miserable mo
tivation or their probable apathy as senators does
not concern my eventual argument. What matters
is that they are just plain annoying.
The second species I label left-wing toadies.
Again. I am making no value judgements about the
admirable stands of Stanford out of South Africa,
the Third World Women's Caucus, nor any of the
other august bodies that compose the People's
Platform. I am from the Third World myself, and
look upon the glorious struggle for "World
Cultures not imperialist Western Cuture" with
slightly more than a casual air. What annoys me
about the left-wing toadies is not their I eft -
wingedness, but their toadying. How many of the

candidates who have "I support the People's Plat
form" and nothing else on their fliers actually know
enough to qualify to pressure the University for
World Cultures? Not many, I would wager. And
how many actually care? Are you guys trying to
make me believe that freshmen will blow off the
Vedas and the Ramayana less readily then Faust
and Homer? Nice try, guys. (Incidentally, I wonder
how many of the toadies know exactly what the
Ramayana i5....) And even if the left-wing
toadies are actually serious about their convictions,
how many of them are jumping on the romantic
college-activist bandwagon — and how many have
actually thought out each of the issues in the

What annoys me about
the left-wing toadies is
not their left-wingedness,
but their toadying.

People s Platform and come to the conclusion that
each is in their hearts, not only in their abased
minds? If they have all justified it to themselves —
well, it is a great testament to the conformity of the
Stanford environment that so many presumably in
dependent and unrelated individuals share exactly

the same views on so many issues.
A solution I should like to see is the establish
ment of the "minus one" vote as opposed to the
zero vote that is now one's only option to repay a
candidate with particularly swinish political in
tegrity. Think of the "minus one" vote's implications:
Candidates who have nothing to offer except
their name and face would have to be far less ob
noxious and irritating because they could end up
with negative votes. That alone would be worth the
effort. At least the resume-packers and the toadies
would think twice before inflicting us with their
foul political presence.
As a direct result, would-be senators would have
to think up real platforms and real ideas. If that
process is alien to them — well, there are about five
million books in the Stanford libraries. A lengthy
sojourn in Green would probably do them good.
More importantly, it will prevent them for a time
from perpetrating public affronts. Also, we would
not have to mess around with esoteric constitu
tional ammendments that no one really under
stands or cares for. The number of senators will
mysteriously stabilize when word gets around that
real work (yes, the dirty word) is needed to avoid
public humiliation.
Finally, if the Stanford public could be trained to
use the minus one vote judiciously over the long
term so that only the real swine and the real toadies
get minused-out, this new voting system could give
the ASSU two things it urgently needs — real stu
dent politicians with integrity and a little less
apathy, insha-allah (for the World Cuture fans
among you).

how many actually care? Are you guys trying to
make me believe that freshmen will blow off the
Vedas and the Ramayana less readily then Faust
and Homer? Nice try, guys. (Incidentally, I wonder
how many of the toadies know exactly what the
Ramayana i5....) And even if the left-wing
toadies are actually serious about their convictions,
how many of them are jumping on the romantic
college-activist bandwagon — and how many have
actually thought out each of the issues in the

What annoys me about
the left-wing toadies is
not their left-wingedness,
but their toadying.

People s Platform and come to the conclusion that
each is in their hearts, not only in their abased
minds? If they have all justified it to themselves —
well, it is a great testament to the conformity of the
Stanford environment that so many presumably in
dependent and unrelated individuals share exactly

the same views on so many issues.
A solution I should like to see is the establish
ment of the "minus one" vote as opposed to the
zero vote that is now one's only option to repay a
candidate with particularly swinish political in
tegrity. Think of the "minus one" vote's implications:
Candidates who have nothing to offer except
their name and face would have to be far less ob
noxious and irritating because they could end up
with negative votes. That alone would be worth the
effort. At least the resume-packers and the toadies
would think twice before inflicting us with their
foul political presence.
As a direct result, would-be senators would have
to think up real platforms and real ideas. If that
process is alien to them — well, there are about five
million books in the Stanford libraries. A lengthy
sojourn in Green would probably do them good.
More importantly, it will prevent them for a time
from perpetrating public affronts. Also, we would
not have to mess around with esoteric constitu
tional ammendments that no one really under
stands or cares for. The number of senators will
mysteriously stabilize when word gets around that
real work (yes, the dirty word) is needed to avoid
public humiliation.
Finally, if the Stanford public could be trained to
use the minus one vote judiciously over the long
term so that only the real swine and the real toadies
get minused-out, this new voting system could give
the ASSU two things it urgently needs — real stu
dent politicians with integrity and a little less
apathy, insha-allah (for the World Cuture fans
among you).
