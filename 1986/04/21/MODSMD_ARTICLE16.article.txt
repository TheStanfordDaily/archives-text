## Animals exploited by medical research 
### 
April 24 is World Day for Laboratory
Animals, an international reminder of concern
tor the billions of animals (70 million annually in
this country alone) that give their lives worldwide
in the service of humanity.
They do not, of course, their lives. Their
lives are wrenched from them — without the op
tion of informed consent — often under rather
gruesome circumstances. Whether this huge
bloodletting is indeed performed only in the ser
vice of humanity is open to some question. In
fact, all too much of it serves chiefly a very small,
well-financed, powerful and prestigious minority
— namely, the researchers themselves and the in
stitutions they serve.

What goes on behind the laboratory door is a
very covert operation. Although almost all
animal research conducted in universities is
financed by public funds, public scrutiny of their
application is fiercely rejected.
Research animals are almost entirely unpro
tected by law. Section 599 c of the California
Penal Code specifically exempts research institu
tions from the anti-cruelty laws that apply to the
rest of us. The only legal protection lab animals
have is the federal Animal Welfare Act, a pitiful
piece of legislation most recently amended last
December in very gingerly fashion by the Dole-
Brown bill whose meager provisions still do not
even cover rats and mice (the vast majority of
laboratory animals used — 94 percent at Stan
ford), nor livestock.

The Act is enforced by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, which in 1984, according to the
General Accounting Office, never inspected half
of the facilities in California at all and averaged
one inspection per year per institution statewide.
Funding for it has now been zero-budgeted by
the Reagan Administration.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the
chief dispenser of federal funds for biomedical
research, have their own guidelines and ac
creditation mechanisms. Stanford lost its ac
creditation in 1982. In 1981, it received
$44,511,192 from theNlH. By 1984, when Stan
ford had been afoul of NIH guidelines for three
years, the NIH had actually increased its grants
to Stanford to total $64,240,190.
For every dollar in real costs of government
grants, Stanford gets an additional 7 1 percent for
"indirect cost recovery." That 71 percent makes
up over 40 percent of the University's annual
income. It thus constitutes a powerful economic
incentive not to ruffle the feathers of the geese
that lay the golden eggs.
It seems most unlikely that that message has
not penetrated to the oversight committee on re
search protocols appointed by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, who has declared animals
rights advocates to be "vigilantes" and "single
issue people such as right-to-lifers and me
firsters."
This is the body much touted as the in-house
safeguard against frivolous or cruel experiments.
It has thus presumably passed favorably on such
research projects as those of Prof. Seymour
Levine, who has kept monkeys confined in cages
measuring 2x2x2 feet, some in pairs, some alone,

for as long as 15 years (termed "a diabolical act"
by UC-Davis Veterinary Prof. Nedim Buyuk
mihci) in order to discover, as he told some
recent visitors, "that puberty brings about
profound changes." For such items of benefit to
humanity the government has given him millions
of dollars over the decades, of which Stanford has
received a pretty penny.
Most animal rightists know full well that
animal research will not cease tomorrow.
Regardless, therefore, of individual philosophical
positions, the activities of the mainstream of the
animal rights movement are chiefly directed at
finding means of reducing the number of animals
used and at promoting better conditions and
more stringent protective legislation for those
that are. It would be foolish to assert that all re
searchers are fiends or that no gain has come
from animal experimentation. But it is equally
true that the billions of animal lives sacrificed
have not, in terms of human betterment, found
their mark. To eliminate just the many thousands
of stupid, useless, self-serving, infinitely
repetitive (even as opposed to replicative) ex
periments conducted would in itself reduce by
astronomical numbers the misery, exploitation
and butchery of creatures who are utterly help
less against us. Human benefit would probably
suffer little from it. That the medical profession
and the institutions involved — with Stanford in
the forefront — remain blindly defensive of their
own interests and obstinately refuse to deal with
the ethical implications involved is not their
finest stance and may in the long run not serve
them well.
