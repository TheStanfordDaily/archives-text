# Scholar defends Mosher in letter
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
A prominent Chinese historian has
written a letter to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy urging him to
reinstate former Stanford anthropol
ogy graduate student Steven Mosher,
who was expelled in 1983.
Princeton University Prof. Freder
ick Mote, in a March 3 letter to Ken
nedy made public by Mosher, said
Kennedy's "continuing failure to dis
pel the well-substantiated view that
Stanford's action against Steven
Mosher was in fact taken in response
to pressures from the Chinese gov
ernment has grave implications for
the entire field of Chinese studies."
Mosher, who is currently planning
a lawsuit against the University to
gain reinstatement, has consistently
held that his expulsion did not stem
from his alleged misbehavior, which
included misappropriation of Univer
sity camera equipment and infrac
tions against the Chinese government
during his stay in 1979 and 1980.
Rather, Mosher said, he was ex
pelled because he embarrassed the
Chinese government by publishing
articles and photographs revealing its
controversial population control
techniques, including forced abor
tions on women in late stages of preg
nancy.
Mosher told The Daily Saturday
that Mote's letter reveals a "growing
feeling" that his expulsion is an as
sault on academic freedom.
"This represents the first real indi

cation that (Mote) and others are
greatly embarrassed by Stanford's ac
tions. He's the most well-known
Chinese historian in the United
States," Mosher said, adding that
many other scholars in his field have
expressed private support for his
cause.
"There is a fear that if they speak
up, they'll be barred from China,"
Mosher said.
The lettei which Mote originally
sent to Kerinedy and the Stanford
Board of Tr istees, was circulated to
members of the Stanford faculty last
week by The Steven Mosher Defense
Committee, a group of supporters.
In addition, the group has raised
$6,000 so far to cover the costs of a
lawsuit, Mosher said.
"When there's $10,000, we're
going to court," Mosher said.
Kennedy said Saturday he had
written Mote a reply but did not wish
to discuss the matter before Mote had
an opportunity to respond.
It is "best to conduct a dialogue
like this in correspondence, not
newspapers," Kennedy said.
Mote's letter has attracted atten
tion. Syndicated columnist William F.
Buckley said Mote's letter was a
"dramatic intervention" in Mosher's
attempt to "fight back" against the
University.
"Mote's ... point strikes resonantly
at everyone in America who for 25
years was fooled about Mao Tse
Tung," Buckley said in his column.
Mote could not be reached for
comment.
