## Buildings grow on Farm 
### JOHN CALLON 
They say nothing is certain but death and
taxes, but we are all well aware of a third ir
refutable fact of life — the eternal presence of
construction on the Stanford campus.
Three projects in particular — the Keck Sci
ence Building, Sweet Hall and an addition to
the Graduate School of Business — are
"allowing us to meet some of the most impor
tant academic needs which exist," according to
Jacqueline Bryan, facilities manager for
humanities and sciences.
The new Keck Science Building, for one,
"will allow faculty to do what they [need to]
do," she said.
The three-story structure, erected near the
Rodin Sculpture Garden behind the Old
Chemistry Building, is the latest addition to
Stanford's physical plant, and also stands as the
first structure in Stanford's $250 million Near
West Campus Redevelopment Project.
Dedicated April 2, the $14.7 million project
used a "design-build" approach in construction
to provide relief laboratory space for the de
partments of biological science, chemistry and
chemical engineering in the shortest time possi
ble.
Construction of the 68,600-gross-square-foot
building was completed in a little more than a
year. Fifteen faculty members from the three
departments were allowed to move into their
laboratories last January.
Construction was begun months before
designs for laboratories and offices were com
pleted. Steve Copenhagen, the architect who
was in charge of laboratory design, told Univer
sity News and Publications that the concept of
designing while construction is underway is "not
radical, it's been around for years." But very
few have used this approach because "they
think it will cost more," he said.
"It worked here because of the need — the
need drove the solution," he said.
The building will serve as laboratory "surge"
space for scientists as the Near West Campus
undergoes redevelopment in the next 10 to 15
years.
At the building's dedication, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy said that the redevelop
ment project is "the greatest single privately
supported building program for science and en
gineering that I think has been undertaken by

any university in the world."
Kennedy called the Keck Building the
"keystone" of the project.
"You cannot play musical chairs without one
empty chair," he said, explaining that "it's going
to be the critical role of this building to provide
the space that allows us to make provision for
people to be moved out of one thing while we
prepare for the next."
Still under construction but on schedule for
completion in August is the four-story Sweet
Hall, according to Olivier Pieron of Facilities
Project Management.
The 52,000-gross-square-foot building and
its prominent tower sit between Meyer Library
and the CERAS building, across the mall from
the post office and the Bookstore.
At a total project cost of $8,750,000, Sweet
Hall will house LOTS, now found in CERAS
and the former bowling alley at Tresidder. IRIS
(Instructional and Recreational Information
Systems) and undergraduate programs of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
Consideration for the two computer tenants
affected the building's interior design. The
building will be air-conditioned due to the heat
generated by the heavy use of computers, and
flexibility for dealing with the networking and
cabling of computers was incorporated into the
design as well, Pieron told University News and
Publications.
The particular site was chosen because of its
proximity to CERAS, the libraries and student
residences, which would allow for "easy access
and use for all students," Pieron said.
The addition planned at the Graduate School
of Business has apparently survived the contro
versy surrounding its possible transgression of
Frederick Olmstead's original architectural
campus design, and construction is slated to
begin in mid-July or August, according to GSB
Associate Dean of Administration Paul
Johnson. Completion is foreseen sometime in
early 1988.
Objections had been raised by members of
the Stanford Historical Society and Art History
Prof. Paul Turner over the site of the addition,
which they feel will encroach on Stanford's for
mal main entrance.
The U-shaped building will straddle Lasuen
Street behind Memorial Way and will be con
nected to the current GSB building by a covered
arcade.
