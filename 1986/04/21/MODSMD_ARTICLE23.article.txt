# The 						Question Man takes on the Riddler
## 
### 
Undoubtedly, we spent many of
the Saturday mornings of our youth
watching them, and we never really
forget them. A lot of us probably still
watch them. At any rate, they always
receive a loud cheer at the Flicks.
Cartoons are a kind of American
institution. Last week, I, your humble
servant, The Question Man, set out to
discover the identity of Stanford stu
dents' favorite cartoon villain.
"Well, 1 think it's Ronald Reagan.
He's two-dimensional, smiles a lot,
has great weapons and is always on
the rebound. He just keeps coming
back."
— Jeff Follett, freshman

Wyle E. Coyote. He always
manages to lose. 1 think it's kind of
cute."
— Karen Dustin, senior
"I suppose it's Daffy Duck. He's a
villain in the sense of Bugs Bunny. I
thought he wanted too much limelight
— he needed to be put in his place."
— Maria IX' La Rosa, sophomore
"It's definitely Egghead. I think
he's kind of fun — I love his
costumes. Besides, he keeps saying,
'I'm so eggcited, it's so eggciting,"
which is absolutely adorable."
— Bonnie Boyd, junior
"The Riddler from Batman was my
favorite villain. Anyone who could
wear flashy green tights and make

them look so cute — you had to like
him."
— David Sroaf, junior
"The Road Runner. He's so viol
ent. He teaches kids so much vio
lence."
— Ashley David, sophomore
"Wyle E. Coyote, definitely. 1 like
the way he chases after the Road
Runner. I'd love to see what he'd do
if he ever caught him."
— Andrew Pearson, sophomore
"I wasn't allowed to watch car
toons when I was young. But I did
have a favorite cartoon villain. She
was my sister."
— Maria Gallegos, freshman
"I think Wyle E. Coyote heads the

list. His innovative destruction meth
ods were absolutely fascinating."
— David Ritsher, freshman
"The Joker was my favorite villain.
He had the most outrageous
costumes, and was rather weird."
— Lisa Goebel, junior
"Simon Bar Sinister, from 'The
Adventures of Underdog.' He was
weird-looking and did ridiculous
things like drying up all the water in
the world."
