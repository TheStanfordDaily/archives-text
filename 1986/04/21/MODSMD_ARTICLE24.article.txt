## Werdel leads Stanford to USC upset 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Freshman Eleni Rossides was
hobbled by shin splints and could
only watch from the bleachers. Soph
omore Kay Tittle probably wished
she was watching, but instead played
with a 101-degree temperature. And
junior Patty Fendick was just plain
sick of the way she was playing.
Despite these disconcerting cir
cumstances, the No. 2-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team defeated
No. 1 USC 5-4 Saturday before a
large crowd at the Varsity Tennis
Courts.
"It was really pretty impressive
considering Eleni was out and Kay
was a non-person today," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said after the
match.
Impressive were juniors Leigh
Anne Eldredge and Stephanie
Savides, sophomore Cari Hagey and
freshman Marianne Werdel, who ac
counted for the Cardinal's points on
the afternoon.
Hagey and Savides were double
winners, each winning their singles
matches and combining in doubles to
record the clinching victory.
Eldredge and Werdel were sensa
tional in scoring singles victories.
The win improved Stanford's
record to 16-1 and avenged a 6-3 loss
at USC on April 4. It was the Card
inal's 37th consecutive dual match
victory on its home courts. The
Trojans dropped to 16-2.
Hagey has played almost flawless
tennis since moving into the singles
lineup in early March when Rossides
injured her shins. Saturday was no
exception as she knocked off USC's
Dena Levy 6-3, 6-4 in the No. 6
singles match to give the Cardinal a
1-0 lead.
Levy handed Hagey her only
singles loss of the season in the teams'
previous match. This time, however,
Hagey took control, winning the first
three games of the first set. Levy
broke back in the fifth game and
evened the set at 3-3, but Hagey then
won the next three games to take the
set.
Trailing 4-1 in the second set,
Hagey broke Levy's serve twice and
rattled off five quick games to win the
set and match.
The most exciting match of the day

featured Werdel and USC's Heliane
Steden at No. 2 singles. The Trojans
looked to record a win with Steden,
who came into the match with a 13-0
dual match record and the nation's
No. 4 ranking.
But Werdel, who until recently had
not played up to her credentials as the
No. 1 freshman in the nation,
matched Steden point for point in the
first set. The two battled into a tie
breaker, and with the score 6-6, Wer
del broke Steden's serve to go up 7-6.
She then held her serve to win the tie
breaker and the set.
Motivated by the homecourt
crowd, which was focusing most of its
attention on her match, Werdel con
tinued to sizzle in the second set. She
chased Steden around the court with
her powerful groundstrokes, which
she was able to place deep in the cor
ners of the court.
Werdel broke Steden's serve to go
up 3-1 in the second set and then
survived a 1-3 deficit in the seventh
game to hold her serve and take a 5-2
advantage. After Steden held her
serve, Werdel did likewise to claim
the set and match.
"It was an awesome match," Bren
nan said of the Werdel-Steden dual.
"It's one of the best matches I've ever
seen."
The No. 4 singles match between
Savides and USC's Maeve Quinlan
was as unpredictable as the Werdel
match was sensational.
Savides served for the first set at 5-
4 and 6-5 but failed to win both
times, and the set went to a tie
breaker. Once again, she looked
ready to take the set, moving ahead
6-2 in the tie-breaker.
Quinlan, however, won five
straight points to gain a 7-6 advan
tage, and the two then took turns
losing their serves on set-points.
Savides eventually held her serve at
11-10 to win the set.
Quinlan sent the match to three
sets by capturing the second 6-2, but
Savides was able to recover in the
third.
With Savides leading 5-4 and
Quinlan serving at 3-3 in the 10th
game, Quinlan netted a shot to give
the Cardinal the match and a 3-0 ad
vantage.
"That's Stephanie. She dances to a
different drummer," Brennan said of
Savides' inability to put Quinlan away

early in the match. "She's got to turn
to tapioca before she can relax."
Leading 3-0, Stanford needed just
two more victories to clinch the
match. But with an ailing Tittle and
an inconsistent Fendick, the Cardinal
was far from a cinch.
In the No. 5 singles, Tittle played
despite her illness, but was "just a
half-step" slow, according to Bren
nan.
USC freshman Ginny Purdy broke
Tittle's serve three times in the first

set and twice in the second set to
record a 6-2, 6-4 victory. The loss
was only Tittle's second of the season.
Fendick started the No. I singles
match with a bang, breaking Caroline
Kuhlman's serve to take a 1-0 lead.
Kuhlman entered the match as the
nation's top-ranked player and a 25-0
overall record.
The rest of the set was dominated
by Kuhlman, though, as Fendick
struggled with her shot selection. The
USC sophomore took the set 6-2.

Fendick played better in the second
set, sending it to a tie-breaker, but
Kuhlman prevailed to cut the Card
inal's lead in the match to 3-2.
"She (Fendick) didn't coordinate
well today," Brennan said.
Throughout the match, Fendick
tried to move Kuhlman around the
court with drop shots, but Brennan
said the strategy was doomed from
the start. "Kuhlman is impossible to
drop shot," he said. "That's a shot

she (Fendick) should have never
tried.
"I still think Patty playing well can
beat Kuhlman, hut nobody can beat
her from the backcourt," Brennan
added. "And Patty never serves and
volleys.'"
While most people were watching
Kuhlman beat Fendick, Eldredge was
quietly and soundly defeating USC's
Mary Norwood in the No. 3 singles


Marianne Werdel is starting to fulfill the promise of greatness she
brought to the Farm as a freshman this year. Saturday, she beat fourth-

Todd Sitrin/Dailv
ranked (JSC senior Heliane Steden, who had previously been unde
feated in dual match play.
