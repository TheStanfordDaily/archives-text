# Cardinal falters in weekend series
## Bruins come to town for doubleheader with one game league lead 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Chances — they don t come a dime a dozen. So when
you're lucky enough to have one, you darn well better
take advantage of it.
Or else.
Rick Morris, Arizona State's center fielder, taught
Stanford's baseball team that cruel lesson yesterday —
with one swing of his aluminum bat.
In the top of the 11th inning at Sunken Diamond, Mor
ris yanked Brian Keyser's two-out, two-strike pitch for a
home run to put the visiting Sun Devils on top for good, 7-
6, after a see-saw battle.
"I was kind of fooled by the pitch," said Morris of his
towering, windswept pop that just did clear the left-field
fence. "It was a slider on the outside part of the plate, a
good pitch. I didn't get a very good hack, but I hit it pretty
good."
"You have to give him credit," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It was a good pitch. ... He just hit it well."
Morris' blow put an end to a day that for Stanford had
been a series of blown chances and which left Cardinal
players scratching their heads.
"This one was a tough loss," Stanford catcher John
Ramos said afterward. "We're a better team, but that just
didn't show out there today."
In the bottom of the ninth, with the score knotted at 5-
5, Stanford squandered a golden chance to walk away
with a win.
Third baseman Ruben Amaro, who reached first on a
force play, stole second with two out. Tony Harris, who
relieved ASU's starter Rick Dempster in the eighth, in
tentionally walked Mark Davis to bring up Toi Cook,
Stanford's cleanup hitter and leader in RBIs with 31.
Cook. 6-for-13 in the series when he stepped into the bat
ter's box, had earlier driven in two of Stanford's runs with
a two-out, line-drive single to right-center field in the bot
tom of the third.
Cook didn't even get to swing his bat.
Harris caught Amaro, who had broken for third before
the pitch to Cook, in an inning-ending rundown between
second and third.
"That was a big mistake that hurt us," Marquess said.
"It wasn't a good time to do that (break with the pitch).
"Basically it was my fault. .. I could have put the stop
sign on him (Cook) but I didn't," Marquess added.
For the Cardinal it was the last in a series of chances
gone awry.
Earlier, Stanford watched as its ace, Jack McDowell,
couldn't hold a 5-2 lead given him after three innings.
In the top of the fifth. ASU came up with three runs to
tie. A pair of walks, back-to-back singles and Amaro's
throwing error victimized the right-handed sophomore,
who failed to complete a start for the first time in six out
ings.
McDowell's broken streak notwithstanding, his effort
was impressive enough. Despite a sore right shoulder that
had prevented him from throwing a baseball in 10 days.
McDowell lasted through nine innings, surrendering II
hits and six runs — five of which were earned. He threw
over 160 pitches on a hot, summer-like afternoon.
"He's our best," Marquess said. "I'm going to stay with
him until the cows go home."
To stick with the bovine metaphor, Ole' Bessy was
out to pasture until the ninth inning. But in the 10th.
Marquess decided that McDowell had had enough, and he

called on Keyser, a freshman, to come in out of the
bullpen.
Keyser retired ASU in order in the 10th, striking out
two. and got two quick outs in the Sun Devils' half of the
1 Ith. The sixth batter to face him. however, was Morris —
he of the big stick.
Harris. 8-2, made Morris' bases-empty home run, his
16th blast on the year, stand up by setting Stanford down
in order in the bottom of the inning.
With yesterday's win. ASU took two of the three
weekend games from Stanford. The Sun Devils won
Friday's opener 7-2 behind the six-hit pitching of Mike
Thorpe and David Cassidy, then dropped Saturday's con
test 13-8 as the Cardinal pounded out 14 hits, three of
which were home runs.
With the loss. Stanford fell out of a first-place tie with
UCLA in the Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division.
The Bruins. 13-7. survived California's ninth-inning rally
at Berkeley's Evans Diamond yesterday to escape with
their second win in three weekend meetings between the
teams.
UCLA, which plays a doubleheader with Stanford at
Sunken Diamond today at noon, holds a one-game lead
over the second-place teams. Stanford, 12-7 in the Six -
Pac, and Arizona, 13-8.
On Friday, Stanford's starter, Lee Plemel. pitched
three-hit baseball through the first five innings and took a

1-0 lead into the sixth. Then Plemel ran into trouble.
Tim Esmay drew a walk to start the sixth, and Morris
followed with single to right. Just when it appeared ASU
would get to Plemel, the righthander — who shut out the
Sun Devils on three hits less than a month ago in Tempe,
Ariz. —struck out Ted Dyson and Steve Marriuchi.
All that was left for Plemel to do was to get that third
and final out. It proved elusive.
Dwight Thomas, ASU's left fielder, lunged at Plemel's
one-hall offering and looped what looked for all the world
like a routine fly ball to left.
"When I hit it," Thomas said. "I thought it was an f-7
(flyout to left field). I don't know how it got out."
Thomas* three-run home run was all Thorpe and Cas
sidy needed. Thorpe, who improved his record to 4-5 with
the win. allowed five hits and two runs in 6-2/3 innings of
work.
"I was mostly just trying to jump ahead." said Thorpe,
who was rocked by Stanford in Tempe in the teams' ear
lier series matchup and suffered a loss in that game. "I've
had some control problems, but now I've changed my me
chanics." Thorpe walked three batters.
Cassidy. his reliever, did even better. In recording his
first save of the year, the angular left-hander threw 2-1/3

scoreless innings, giving up only
Amaro's groundball single in the
eighth.
Plemel, 3-2, was the tough-luck
loser.
Stanford's bats came alive long
enough this weekend to rout ASU on
Saturday. The Cardinal, which had 11
runs on the scoreboard after three in
nings of play, pounded out 14 hits,
five for extra bases.
Mark Davis hit his team-high
fourth home run of the year, a three
run shot in the second inning off
losing pitcher Royal Clayton, 2-3.
An inning later, Amaro roped an
other Clayton pitch for a three-run
round tripper. The next batter,
Ramos, greeted Clayton's relief, Cas
sidy, with a solo home run to the op
posite field.
The chief beneficiary of Stanford's
run production was A 1 Osuna, who
replaced starter Rob Wassenaar after
the third inning. The southpaw went
the final six frames, surrendering 10
hits and three runs to earn his sixth
victory against two setbacks.
Coming off a loss like yesterday's
isn't the ideal way to enter a big
game, but that's the task facing the
Cardinal.

Stanford hosts Six-Pac leading
UCLA in a doubleheader today at
Sunken Diamond.
"It'll be tough (to come right
back), but we'll be ready. . . we just
have to be competitive out there,"
Ramos said, ice soothing an injury to
his left ankle originally sustained
Friday when he fouled a ball off his
foot.
The most urgent of Marquess'
problems is a shortage of rested arms.
Kevin Kunkel, 3-3 with a 3.66 ERA,
will start today's first game, but no
one has been chosen for the second.
"It'll be whoever is healthy,"
Marquess said, mentioning later that
he'll likely choose between Was
senaar, a junior, and freshmen Jim
Price and Pete Salmon.
Marquess, whose team appeared
solidly in first place scarcely two
weeks ago, is getting that back-to
the-wall feeling: "W eve got to get at
least a split. If they sweep us. we'll be
three games behind," he said.
After today, only nine games, or
three series, will remain on Stanford's
Six-Pac schedule.

The Bruins. 13-7. survived California's ninth-inning rally
at Berkeley's Evans Diamond yesterday to escape with
their second win in three weekend meetings between the
teams.
UCLA, which plays a doubleheader with Stanford at
Sunken Diamond today at noon, holds a one-game lead
over the second-place teams. Stanford, 12-7 in the Six -
Pac, and Arizona, 13-8.
On Friday, Stanford's starter, Lee Plemel. pitched
three-hit baseball through the first five innings and took a

1-0 lead into the sixth. Then Plemel ran into trouble.
Tim Esmay drew a walk to start the sixth, and Morris
followed with single to right. Just when it appeared ASU
would get to Plemel, the righthander — who shut out the
Sun Devils on three hits less than a month ago in Tempe,
Ariz. —struck out Ted Dyson and Steve Marriuchi.
All that was left for Plemel to do was to get that third
and final out. It proved elusive.
Dwight Thomas, ASU's left fielder, lunged at Plemel's
one-hall offering and looped what looked for all the world
like a routine fly ball to left.
"When I hit it," Thomas said. "I thought it was an f-7
(flyout to left field). I don't know how it got out."
Thomas* three-run home run was all Thorpe and Cas
sidy needed. Thorpe, who improved his record to 4-5 with
the win. allowed five hits and two runs in 6-2/3 innings of
work.
"I was mostly just trying to jump ahead." said Thorpe,
who was rocked by Stanford in Tempe in the teams' ear
lier series matchup and suffered a loss in that game. "I've
had some control problems, but now I've changed my me
chanics." Thorpe walked three batters.
Cassidy. his reliever, did even better. In recording his
first save of the year, the angular left-hander threw 2-1/3

scoreless innings, giving up only
Amaro's groundball single in the
eighth.
Plemel, 3-2, was the tough-luck
loser.
Stanford's bats came alive long
enough this weekend to rout ASU on
Saturday. The Cardinal, which had 11
runs on the scoreboard after three in
nings of play, pounded out 14 hits,
five for extra bases.
Mark Davis hit his team-high
fourth home run of the year, a three
run shot in the second inning off
losing pitcher Royal Clayton, 2-3.
An inning later, Amaro roped an
other Clayton pitch for a three-run
round tripper. The next batter,
Ramos, greeted Clayton's relief, Cas
sidy, with a solo home run to the op
posite field.
The chief beneficiary of Stanford's
run production was A 1 Osuna, who
replaced starter Rob Wassenaar after
the third inning. The southpaw went
the final six frames, surrendering 10
hits and three runs to earn his sixth
victory against two setbacks.
Coming off a loss like yesterday's
isn't the ideal way to enter a big
game, but that's the task facing the
Cardinal.

"It'll be tough (to come right

foot.

problems is a shortage of rested arms.
Kevin Kunkel, 3-3 with a 3.66 ERA,
will start today's first game, but no
one has been chosen for the second.
"It'll be whoever is healthy,"
Marquess said, mentioning later that
he'll likely choose between Was
senaar, a junior, and freshmen Jim
Price and Pete Salmon.
Marquess, whose team appeared
solidly in first place scarcely two
weeks ago, is getting that back-to
the-wall feeling: "W eve got to get at
least a split. If they sweep us. we'll be
three games behind," he said.
After today, only nine games, or
three series, will remain on Stanford's
Six-Pac schedule.

Or else.
Rick Morris, Arizona State's center fielder, taught
Stanford's baseball team that cruel lesson yesterday —
with one swing of his aluminum bat.
In the top of the 11th inning at Sunken Diamond, Mor
ris yanked Brian Keyser's two-out, two-strike pitch for a
home run to put the visiting Sun Devils on top for good, 7-
6, after a see-saw battle.
"I was kind of fooled by the pitch," said Morris of his
towering, windswept pop that just did clear the left-field
fence. "It was a slider on the outside part of the plate, a
good pitch. I didn't get a very good hack, but I hit it pretty
good."
"You have to give him credit," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It was a good pitch. ... He just hit it well."
Morris' blow put an end to a day that for Stanford had
been a series of blown chances and which left Cardinal
players scratching their heads.
"This one was a tough loss," Stanford catcher John
Ramos said afterward. "We're a better team, but that just
didn't show out there today."
In the bottom of the ninth, with the score knotted at 5-
5, Stanford squandered a golden chance to walk away
with a win.
Third baseman Ruben Amaro, who reached first on a
force play, stole second with two out. Tony Harris, who
relieved ASU's starter Rick Dempster in the eighth, in
tentionally walked Mark Davis to bring up Toi Cook,
Stanford's cleanup hitter and leader in RBIs with 31.
Cook. 6-for-13 in the series when he stepped into the bat
ter's box, had earlier driven in two of Stanford's runs with
a two-out, line-drive single to right-center field in the bot
tom of the third.
Cook didn't even get to swing his bat.
Harris caught Amaro, who had broken for third before
the pitch to Cook, in an inning-ending rundown between
second and third.
"That was a big mistake that hurt us," Marquess said.
"It wasn't a good time to do that (break with the pitch).
"Basically it was my fault. .. I could have put the stop
sign on him (Cook) but I didn't," Marquess added.
For the Cardinal it was the last in a series of chances
gone awry.
Earlier, Stanford watched as its ace, Jack McDowell,
couldn't hold a 5-2 lead given him after three innings.
In the top of the fifth. ASU came up with three runs to
tie. A pair of walks, back-to-back singles and Amaro's
throwing error victimized the right-handed sophomore,
who failed to complete a start for the first time in six out
ings.
McDowell's broken streak notwithstanding, his effort
was impressive enough. Despite a sore right shoulder that
had prevented him from throwing a baseball in 10 days.
McDowell lasted through nine innings, surrendering II
hits and six runs — five of which were earned. He threw
over 160 pitches on a hot, summer-like afternoon.
"He's our best," Marquess said. "I'm going to stay with
him until the cows go home."
To stick with the bovine metaphor, Ole' Bessy was
out to pasture until the ninth inning. But in the 10th.
Marquess decided that McDowell had had enough, and he

called on Keyser, a freshman, to come in out of the
bullpen.
Keyser retired ASU in order in the 10th, striking out
two. and got two quick outs in the Sun Devils' half of the
1 Ith. The sixth batter to face him. however, was Morris —
he of the big stick.
Harris. 8-2, made Morris' bases-empty home run, his
16th blast on the year, stand up by setting Stanford down
in order in the bottom of the inning.
With yesterday's win. ASU took two of the three
weekend games from Stanford. The Sun Devils won
Friday's opener 7-2 behind the six-hit pitching of Mike
Thorpe and David Cassidy, then dropped Saturday's con
test 13-8 as the Cardinal pounded out 14 hits, three of
which were home runs.

After today, only nine games, or
three series, will remain on Stanford's
Six-Pac schedule.

Chances — they don t come a dime a dozen. So when
you're lucky enough to have one, you darn well better
take advantage of it.
Or else.
Rick Morris, Arizona State's center fielder, taught
Stanford's baseball team that cruel lesson yesterday —
with one swing of his aluminum bat.
In the top of the 11th inning at Sunken Diamond, Mor
ris yanked Brian Keyser's two-out, two-strike pitch for a
home run to put the visiting Sun Devils on top for good, 7-
6, after a see-saw battle.
"I was kind of fooled by the pitch," said Morris of his
towering, windswept pop that just did clear the left-field
fence. "It was a slider on the outside part of the plate, a
good pitch. I didn't get a very good hack, but I hit it pretty
good."
"You have to give him credit," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "It was a good pitch. ... He just hit it well."
Morris' blow put an end to a day that for Stanford had
been a series of blown chances and which left Cardinal
players scratching their heads.
"This one was a tough loss," Stanford catcher John
Ramos said afterward. "We're a better team, but that just
didn't show out there today."
In the bottom of the ninth, with the score knotted at 5-
5, Stanford squandered a golden chance to walk away
with a win.
Third baseman Ruben Amaro, who reached first on a
force play, stole second with two out. Tony Harris, who
relieved ASU's starter Rick Dempster in the eighth, in
tentionally walked Mark Davis to bring up Toi Cook,
Stanford's cleanup hitter and leader in RBIs with 31.
Cook. 6-for-13 in the series when he stepped into the bat
ter's box, had earlier driven in two of Stanford's runs with
a two-out, line-drive single to right-center field in the bot
tom of the third.
Cook didn't even get to swing his bat.
Harris caught Amaro, who had broken for third before
the pitch to Cook, in an inning-ending rundown between
second and third.
"That was a big mistake that hurt us," Marquess said.
"It wasn't a good time to do that (break with the pitch).
"Basically it was my fault. .. I could have put the stop
sign on him (Cook) but I didn't," Marquess added.
For the Cardinal it was the last in a series of chances
gone awry.
Earlier, Stanford watched as its ace, Jack McDowell,
couldn't hold a 5-2 lead given him after three innings.
In the top of the fifth. ASU came up with three runs to
tie. A pair of walks, back-to-back singles and Amaro's
throwing error victimized the right-handed sophomore,
who failed to complete a start for the first time in six out
ings.
McDowell's broken streak notwithstanding, his effort
was impressive enough. Despite a sore right shoulder that
had prevented him from throwing a baseball in 10 days.
McDowell lasted through nine innings, surrendering II
hits and six runs — five of which were earned. He threw
over 160 pitches on a hot, summer-like afternoon.
"He's our best," Marquess said. "I'm going to stay with
him until the cows go home."
To stick with the bovine metaphor, Ole' Bessy was
out to pasture until the ninth inning. But in the 10th.
Marquess decided that McDowell had had enough, and he

called on Keyser, a freshman, to come in out of the
bullpen.
Keyser retired ASU in order in the 10th, striking out
two. and got two quick outs in the Sun Devils' half of the
1 Ith. The sixth batter to face him. however, was Morris —
he of the big stick.
Harris. 8-2, made Morris' bases-empty home run, his
16th blast on the year, stand up by setting Stanford down
in order in the bottom of the inning.
With yesterday's win. ASU took two of the three
weekend games from Stanford. The Sun Devils won
Friday's opener 7-2 behind the six-hit pitching of Mike
Thorpe and David Cassidy, then dropped Saturday's con
test 13-8 as the Cardinal pounded out 14 hits, three of
which were home runs.
With the loss. Stanford fell out of a first-place tie with
UCLA in the Pacific 10 Conference's Southern Division.
The Bruins. 13-7. survived California's ninth-inning rally
at Berkeley's Evans Diamond yesterday to escape with
their second win in three weekend meetings between the
teams.
UCLA, which plays a doubleheader with Stanford at
Sunken Diamond today at noon, holds a one-game lead
over the second-place teams. Stanford, 12-7 in the Six -
Pac, and Arizona, 13-8.
On Friday, Stanford's starter, Lee Plemel. pitched
three-hit baseball through the first five innings and took a

1-0 lead into the sixth. Then Plemel ran into trouble.
Tim Esmay drew a walk to start the sixth, and Morris
followed with single to right. Just when it appeared ASU
would get to Plemel, the righthander — who shut out the
Sun Devils on three hits less than a month ago in Tempe,
Ariz. —struck out Ted Dyson and Steve Marriuchi.
All that was left for Plemel to do was to get that third
and final out. It proved elusive.
Dwight Thomas, ASU's left fielder, lunged at Plemel's
one-hall offering and looped what looked for all the world
like a routine fly ball to left.
"When I hit it," Thomas said. "I thought it was an f-7
(flyout to left field). I don't know how it got out."
Thomas* three-run home run was all Thorpe and Cas
sidy needed. Thorpe, who improved his record to 4-5 with
the win. allowed five hits and two runs in 6-2/3 innings of
work.
"I was mostly just trying to jump ahead." said Thorpe,
who was rocked by Stanford in Tempe in the teams' ear
lier series matchup and suffered a loss in that game. "I've
had some control problems, but now I've changed my me
chanics." Thorpe walked three batters.
Cassidy. his reliever, did even better. In recording his
first save of the year, the angular left-hander threw 2-1/3

This one got away from Walt Harris (31) and Fred Laningham (1) just as last weekend's series with Arizona
did. The Cardinal dropped two out of three to fall a game behind UCLA in the Six-Pac standings.
scoreless innings, giving up only
Amaro's groundball single in the
eighth.
Plemel, 3-2, was the tough-luck
loser.
Stanford's bats came alive long
enough this weekend to rout ASU on
Saturday. The Cardinal, which had 11
runs on the scoreboard after three in
nings of play, pounded out 14 hits,
five for extra bases.
Mark Davis hit his team-high
fourth home run of the year, a three
run shot in the second inning off
losing pitcher Royal Clayton, 2-3.
An inning later, Amaro roped an
other Clayton pitch for a three-run
round tripper. The next batter,
Ramos, greeted Clayton's relief, Cas
sidy, with a solo home run to the op
posite field.
The chief beneficiary of Stanford's
run production was A 1 Osuna, who
replaced starter Rob Wassenaar after
the third inning. The southpaw went
the final six frames, surrendering 10
hits and three runs to earn his sixth
victory against two setbacks.
Coming off a loss like yesterday's
isn't the ideal way to enter a big
game, but that's the task facing the
Cardinal.

Stanford hosts Six-Pac leading
UCLA in a doubleheader today at
Sunken Diamond.
"It'll be tough (to come right
back), but we'll be ready. . . we just
have to be competitive out there,"
Ramos said, ice soothing an injury to
his left ankle originally sustained
Friday when he fouled a ball off his
foot.
The most urgent of Marquess'
problems is a shortage of rested arms.
Kevin Kunkel, 3-3 with a 3.66 ERA,
will start today's first game, but no
one has been chosen for the second.
"It'll be whoever is healthy,"
Marquess said, mentioning later that
he'll likely choose between Was
senaar, a junior, and freshmen Jim
Price and Pete Salmon.
Marquess, whose team appeared
solidly in first place scarcely two
weeks ago, is getting that back-to
the-wall feeling: "W eve got to get at
least a split. If they sweep us. we'll be
three games behind," he said.
After today, only nine games, or
three series, will remain on Stanford's
Six-Pac schedule.
