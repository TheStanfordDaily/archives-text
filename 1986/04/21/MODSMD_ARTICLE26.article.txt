# Men fall twice on trip south
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Except for an occasional earthquake or mudslide,
Southern California is not a hothed for natural dis
asters. Nevertheless, the Stanford men's tennis
team somehow ran into two disasters there in one
weekend.
On Friday, the fourth-ranked Trojans of IJSC
trounced the visiting Cardinal by a 7-2 score. In
reality, the match was over after singles play, as the
Trojans won five out of the first six matches.
Saturday in Westwood was deja-vu for Stanford,
as the second-ranked Bruins of UCLA also won
five of six singles matches en route to a 7-2 victory.
The two losses dropped the sixth-ranked Card
inal's record to 6-3 in the conference and 13-5
overall.
The losses also put a halt to a five-game Cardinal
winning streak, and Stanford Coach Dick Gould
wasn't too happy.
"It was a bitterly disappointing weekend," he
said yesterday."I thought we had gained some mo
mentum with the last few matches at home. But if
we can even conceive of being a contending team
we have to have much better intensity, nerves and
mental toughness."
Needless to say, the Cardinal was not very strong
in those three categories over the weekend. At
USC, Stanford lost five singles matches in straight
sets. Earlier this month at Stanford, the Cardinal
had won four out of six singles matches against the
Trojans on the way to a 5-4 victory.
Of course, that victory came with Stanford senior
Jim Grabb in the lineup. This past weekend, Grabb
did not play singles due to injury, and as a result
Stanford's No. 3 through No. 6 players had to move
up a notch.
Grabb's absence didn't change Cardinal senior
Dan Goldie's opponent. The top Stanford player
still had to play the nation's No. I-ranked player.
USC's Rick Leach, on Friday, and No. 2 Brad
Pea nee of UCLA on Saturday.
The l()th-ranked Goldie lost both matches, being
wiped by Leach 6-1. 6-2 and then being edged by
Pearce 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Previously unbeaten Stanford sophomore Patrick
McEnroe had to move up to the No. 2 singles spot
and ended up with his first two losses of the season.
At USC, ambidextrous freshman Luke Jensen
defeated McEnroe by a 6-3, 6-4 score. In
Westwood, against UCLA, McEnroe fell victim to
the Bruin's Michael Kures 6-3, 6-3.
The only bright spot on the trip for Stanford was
the stellar play of senior Eric Rosenfeld.
Rosenfeld dug out the only two Cardinal singles
victories, defeating USC's Tim Pawsat 6-3, 6-2 and
UCLA's Dan Nahirney 6-4, 6-4.
"We're no lead pipe cinch to get into the nation
als." Gould said. "I hope nobody is thinking we
are."
"So far this team has been a roller coaster. I don't
remember a (Stanford) team that lost so many
matches 5-1 in singles. I think it's an absolute dis
grace. That's because I think we're better than
that."
