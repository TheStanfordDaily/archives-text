# Cunningham signs

### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
Before leaving here, Stanford
Coach Tom Davis said he felt cur
rent senior point guard Keith
Ramee's record of 513 career as
sists would never be broken, but a
challenger has already appeared
on the horizon.
Oliver Cunningham, a 6-foot-4
point guard, recently signed a let
ter of intent to attend Stanford
and is an extraordinary
playmaker. Cunningham averaged
13 assists per game while leading a
talent-laden Ganesha High School
squad to a 28-2 record.
Yesterday, from his home in
Diamond Bar, Cunningham des
cribed his game as "giving the dish
and letting them (big men) finish."
"We needed a point guard and
that's Oliver," said former Stan
ford Asst. Coach Kermit Washing
ton. who is now a strength and
conditioning coach for the Card
inal.
"Ballhandling and making sure
everyone gets the ball," Washing
ton said of Cunningham's
strengths, "and that's important. I
don't think we need another
shooter on the team."
"I would like to help the team in
any way possible," Cunningham
said, "and that's by making people
happy on the court."
Cunningham's game involves
more than just watching other
people score, though.
"The way I've been playing, all
you do is just push the ball (up the
court),"he said. "That's what my
game is — best on the open floor. I
like to penetrate. If the 15-footer
is open I'll take it."

Cunningham averaged 10 points
a game for a balanced team and
also hauled down four rebounds
an outing. His 1.8 steals per game
are evidence of his defensive skills,
and unlike many high school
players, Cunningham takes special
pride in that aspect of his game.
"That (defense) is the strong
point of my game, I prefer a man
to-man" he said. "I love team
defense, that helps create my
break."
Stanford won a relatively low
key recruiting battle for Cunning
ham's services which included
several Ivy League schools and
UC-San Diego.
Three of Cunningham's
teammates have received scholar
ships to play college athletics, and
Washington said, "We think he
was overshadowed by the great
talent around him."
Cunningham made his decision
despite the fact that Stanford has
not selected a new coach.
"My only concern with Coach
Davis leaving was that they had
another coach who had the same
style," said the two-time Aca
demic All-American, who
compiled a 3.92 grade point
average on a 4.0 scale.
Cunningham joins 6-9 Stuart
Thomas from Mater Dei High
School, who signed in November,
on the list of Cardinal recruits.
"Those are the two people we
really wanted," Washington said.
Washington also said that two
other recruits are still considering
the Farm. Deshon Wingate, a 6-8
forward from Austin, Tex., and 6-
9 center-forward Sean Murphy
from Cleveland, Miss., have yet to
announce their college plans.
