# Redwood Shores meet successful
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
This weekend couldn't have gone any better for
the Stanford crew program, but it could have gone
better for the Cardinal crews.
In its first year on the collegiate crew schedule,
the Redwood Shores Stanford Crew Classic turned
out to be a great success. Perfect weather, flawless
officiating and top crews from around the country
added up to an event that has already been slated
for a second year.
The Cardinal crews, however, weren't experienc
ing the same kind of success. The men's varsity
team failed to win even one of its three races in the
round-robin event while the women won one and
lost two of their races.
"The win-loss doesn't look as good as what hap
pened,'" Stanford women's Asst. Coach Wendy
Davis said.
Considering that they were racing against the top
teams in the nation, the record doesn't really reflect
the great improvement both the men and women
have made in the two weeks since the San Diego
Crew Classic.
Wisconsin, the No. 1 women's team in the na

tion, dominated the women's events, beating the
Cardinal crew in the process. "They kind of blew us
out of the water." Davis said. "Wisconsin could be
the best collegiate crew to ever come out."
Stanford also suffered a loss to its perennial rival
Washington. After leading through nearly half the
race, the Cardinal women couldn't keep up their
pace and ended up losing by seven seconds, a larger
margin than they had been hoping for.
"We were hoping to do better against Washing
ton." Davis said. "But they are still within our
grasp for the Pacific Coast Championships."
In their third race the varsity women beat UCLA
easily. The Cardinal women's novice team also beat
the Bruins, setting a new course record in the
process.
Although they didn't meet California head-to
head, the varsity women's times were all faster than
those of the Bears, also a significant improvement.
In the men's events, Stanford's winless record
belied the fact that the Cardinal gained precious
seconds on each team it faced despite a week of
practice that didn't go as well as planned. "We
raced the best racing in memory," Stanford men's
Coach Ken Dreyfuss said. "The growth of the crew
is incredible."

The Wisconsin men's team, though not as in
timidating as its female counterparts, heat the
Cardinal men in the tirst race by a mere tour
seconds.
Four seconds were all that separated Mantoiu
from Washington in their race, also. The losing
margin was a four second improvement in the two
weeks since the teams last met. With three weeks
until their next meeting, the Cardinal still has away
to go to catch the Huskies.
"To be four seconds behind is unthinkable,
Dreyfuss said. "It is really something. And we were
rowing less strokes a minute.
The Brown men showed how they beat previ
ously No. I Harvard, leaving the Stanford crew 12
seconds behind. Even Brown, however, was no
match for the Cal men who beat them by a large
margin. The Bears' win should make Cal the No. 1
team in the nation at this time.
"The Cal win is good for the whole West Coast,"
Dreyfuss said.
In the men's frosh events, the Stanford men suc
cessfully avenged a loss against Orange Coast Col
lege, while the junior varsity lost.

loss to the Trojans.
