### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
It was an exciting finish for the Stanford men's volley
ball team Saturday night at Maples Pavilion as the fifth
place Cardinal gave No. 1-ranked USC a struggle, taking
the undefeated Trojans to four games in the final regular
season match for both teams.
Stanford eventually fell 14-16, 15-13, 11-15, 15-16 to
the winners of the California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association, after having match points in both the first
arid last games of the contest but losing both. USC ended
the season with a 20-0 league mark, while the Cardinal
wound up at 12-8.
USC now gets an automatic berth in the NCAA Final
Four as the CIV A champion. Stanford goes on to the
West Regional, which opens on Thursday at Loyola
Marymount.
The Cardinal, as the fourth seed in the regional, will
play the first seed â€” as yet undetermined since UCLA
and Hawaii finished tied for second after the Bruins upset
Pepperdine in four games on Saturday. The two CIV A
runner-ups split their season series, so a coin flip wili
decide who is the top seed in the regional.
The Trojans must have harbored some concern for their
unblemished record against Stanford. The Cardinal
jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the opening game, then went
up 13-8 and 14-11 only to lose the next five points. The
squad then came from behind at 4-8 and 10-13 to win the
second game. Stanford lost the third game after leading 9-
5, then went up 12-3 in the fourth.
The Trojans then showed why they finished the season
unbeaten. USC fought back to 12-11 and survived match
point at 14-13 and eventually went on to win 16-14.
"USC showed why they're number one," Stanford
senior Dan Parr said. "We just couldn't finish them off."
"The biggest problem in my four years here has been
that we don't think we can do it," Cardinal team captain
Brett Monello said. "We get tight and tentative. We play
not to lose rather than to win. When you start thinking in
volleyball you get in trouble.
"'SC is veiy consistent," Monello added. "They get up
a lot of balls and wait for their opponents to make
mistakes. They don't make a lot of errors. It was more like
we beat ourselves."
"They took advantage of our mistakes when it
counted," Stanford senior Chris Braun agreed. "USC
knew what they had to do to win."
Junior Dave Yoder led USC with 30 kills. Sophomore
Scott McKeough had 2 1 kills while filling in for USC's
leading hitter. Adam Johnson, who
did not make the trip.
' McKeough played great," senior
Monello said. "Johnson's a better
passer, he's a great player, hut I don't
think one player matters that much.
It's what we did on our side of the
net."
"Rudy Dvorak did a great job of
setting and running their offense,"
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw said.
"He did a good job of counteracting
our blocking and defensive schemes.
Yoder also had a geat match."
"Tonight we played well
defensively at times," USC Coach
Bob Yoder said, "but our offense
wasn't steady. Stanford played well
defensively but their ability to side
out let them down; they needed more
chances to put points away. Our guys
are tough competitively; we've come
back a lot this season."
Senior outside hitter Jon Root
topped Stanford with 25 kills. Braun
followed with 20, while sophomore
Scott Fortune had 17 kills to go along
with a .708 hitting percentage.
