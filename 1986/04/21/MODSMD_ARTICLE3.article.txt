Every year, hundreds of Stan
ford seniors go on to attend
graduate school. This year, Mi
chael Rosenthal and Laurie
Edelstein are two such seniors, hut
their path to a graduate education
definitely separates them from the
crowd.

Feature

For one thing, when Rosenthal
and Edelstein attend graduate
school next year, neither will be
hard-pressed to come up with the
money to pay for it. In fact, they
will actually he getting paid while
receiving their educations.
Both are recipients of Andrew
W. Mellon Fellowships for 1986.

Concerned with the recent trend
of the ablest college graduates
turning away from careers in
higher education, the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation established
the Mellon Fellowships program
in 1982.
This year, in the fourth annual
competition, 123 Mellon Fellows
were selected from among 1,565
candidates nominated by faculty
members in the United States and
Canada. Mellon Fellows plan to
pursue advanced study in fields
such as English, history, philoso
phy and classics.
A Mellon Fellowship award in
cludes a cash stipend of $8,500

scholarship that

fellows planning to earn a doctorate
within five years may get support in the
final year.
. Naturally, both Rosenthal and
Edelstein said they were pleased to have
been selected as 1986 Mellon Fellows.
! A native of Los Angeles and a philoso
phy major, Rosenthal will be studying in
the Midwest next year. "I'm going to the
University of Chicago to study philosophy
in graduate school," he explained.
Rosenthal, who is interested in political
philosophy, has been a tutor in the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) pro
gram while at Stanford.
He also stopped out for two years. "I
was in Israel, working and studying He
brew, and studying a little bit, too," he
said. "I'm interested in Jewish philosophy
as well."
Rosenthal is now writing an honors es
say on Franz Fanon and the concept of
violence.
He said that he plans to work in higher
education. "I'd probably like to teach at a
university," he said.
The Mellon Fellowship will be benefi
cial to him in more ways than one, Rosen
thal said. "It's a competitive fellowship
that helps you out financially — a lot," he
said.
Like Rosenthal and many other Mellon
Fellows, Edelstein said that she would also

like to pursue a career in higher educa
tion. "First I hope to complete the Ph.D.
program, and then eventually I would like
to go into teaching at the university level,"
she explained.
She also agreed with Rosenthal on the
financial benefits of the fellowship. "I had
been planning to go to graduate school,
and the fellowship just helps out finan
cially," Edelstein said.
A comparative literature major,
Edelstein said she plans to go to Yale next
year to begin a doctoral program in the
same field. "My primary interest right
now is Russian literature from the 19th
and early 20th centuries," she said.
Edelstein grew up on Long Island, New
York, but her parents currently live in San
Diego. "I'm looking forward to going
back to the East Coast when I'm at Yale,"
she said.
While at Stanford, Edelstein's activities
have been diverse. She has helped organ
ize a student literary journal, tutored for
SLE, been involved with Stanford Out of
South Africa, taught a SWOPSI class,
been a member of the editorial board for
The Daily and served as an student advis
ing associate.
In addition to her accomplishments at
Stanford, Edelstein has also had the op
portunity to study overseas. "I studied in
the Soviet Union two summers ago on a
program sponsored by the Council for In
ternational Educational Exchange," she
said. "I also studied at the Stanford
campus in Berlin."
While overseas, Edelstein put her lan
guage studies to use. "I've studied both
Russian and German literature and lan
guage," she explained. "As a comparative
literature major, I have to have reading
ability in two foreign languages, so Rus
sian and German are my two areas of
study."
Edelstein is currently wri'ing an honors
thesis "on the literary critical debates in
the 1920s in the Soviet Union, and the
changing conception of the author," she
said.

literature major, I have to have reading
ability in two foreign languages, so Rus

study."

Mellon Fellow
Every year, hundreds of Stan
ford seniors go on to attend
graduate school. This year, Mi
chael Rosenthal and Laurie
Edelstein are two such seniors, hut
their path to a graduate education
definitely separates them from the
crowd.

Feature

For one thing, when Rosenthal
and Edelstein attend graduate
school next year, neither will be
hard-pressed to come up with the
money to pay for it. In fact, they
will actually he getting paid while
receiving their educations.
Both are recipients of Andrew
W. Mellon Fellowships for 1986.

Concerned with the recent trend
of the ablest college graduates
turning away from careers in
higher education, the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation established
the Mellon Fellowships program
in 1982.
This year, in the fourth annual
competition, 123 Mellon Fellows
were selected from among 1,565
candidates nominated by faculty
members in the United States and
Canada. Mellon Fellows plan to
pursue advanced study in fields
such as English, history, philoso
phy and classics.
A Mellon Fellowship award in
cludes a cash stipend of $8,500
and covers tuition and fees. They
can be renewed a second year, and
'It's a competitive
scholarship that
helps you out finan
cially — a lot.'

fellows planning to earn a doctorate
within five years may get support in the
final year.
. Naturally, both Rosenthal and
Edelstein said they were pleased to have
been selected as 1986 Mellon Fellows.
! A native of Los Angeles and a philoso
phy major, Rosenthal will be studying in
the Midwest next year. "I'm going to the
University of Chicago to study philosophy
in graduate school," he explained.
Rosenthal, who is interested in political
philosophy, has been a tutor in the
Structured Liberal Education (SLE) pro
gram while at Stanford.
He also stopped out for two years. "I
was in Israel, working and studying He
brew, and studying a little bit, too," he
said. "I'm interested in Jewish philosophy
as well."
Rosenthal is now writing an honors es
say on Franz Fanon and the concept of
violence.
He said that he plans to work in higher
education. "I'd probably like to teach at a
university," he said.
The Mellon Fellowship will be benefi
cial to him in more ways than one, Rosen
thal said. "It's a competitive fellowship
that helps you out financially — a lot," he
said.
Like Rosenthal and many other Mellon
Fellows, Edelstein said that she would also

like to pursue a career in higher educa
tion. "First I hope to complete the Ph.D.
program, and then eventually I would like
to go into teaching at the university level,"
she explained.
She also agreed with Rosenthal on the
financial benefits of the fellowship. "I had
been planning to go to graduate school,
and the fellowship just helps out finan
cially," Edelstein said.
A comparative literature major,
Edelstein said she plans to go to Yale next
year to begin a doctoral program in the
same field. "My primary interest right
now is Russian literature from the 19th
and early 20th centuries," she said.
Edelstein grew up on Long Island, New
York, but her parents currently live in San
Diego. "I'm looking forward to going
back to the East Coast when I'm at Yale,"
she said.
While at Stanford, Edelstein's activities
have been diverse. She has helped organ
ize a student literary journal, tutored for
SLE, been involved with Stanford Out of
South Africa, taught a SWOPSI class,
been a member of the editorial board for
The Daily and served as an student advis
ing associate.
In addition to her accomplishments at
Stanford, Edelstein has also had the op
portunity to study overseas. "I studied in
the Soviet Union two summers ago on a
program sponsored by the Council for In
ternational Educational Exchange," she
said. "I also studied at the Stanford
campus in Berlin."
While overseas, Edelstein put her lan
guage studies to use. "I've studied both
Russian and German literature and lan
guage," she explained. "As a comparative
literature major, I have to have reading
ability in two foreign languages, so Rus
sian and German are my two areas of
study."
Edelstein is currently wri'ing an honors
thesis "on the literary critical debates in
the 1920s in the Soviet Union, and the
changing conception of the author," she
said.
