# Track gets mixed results

For seniors Charles Alexander and Phil Cannon, Satur
day's Bruce Jenner Meet was exactly what they needed â€”
a confidence builder.
Competing at San Jose State City College, Alexander
won his first race in two years, and Cannon, a long and
triple juniper, turned in his second good performance in
the last two weeks. Both had been fighting injuries all
year, and their re-emergence could be important if the
Cardinal hopes to better last year's lOth-place Pacific 10
Conference finish.
After staying back and waiting out the first two miles of
the 5,000 meters, Alexander broke away from a 20-man
field and ran to a nine-second victory and a time of
14:27.4, a mark which could earn the Cardinal some
points at the Pac-10 meet.
"It was good for me to win a race, to gain some confi
dence," Alexander said. Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Woll
man agreed. "We weren't really expecting much from Al
exander, so it's especially good to see him healthy."
Going into the season, the team had also hoped for a lot
from Cannon, but so far this year, injuries had stifled the
senior. But Saturday marked Cannon's second appear
ance of the year, and his second good performance as
well.
Last week Cannon jumped over 50 feet, and this week
he was over 49, despite the fact that, as Wollman said,

"He was over a foot away from the board."
Other landmarks for the men's team were freshman
Glenn Schneider's discus throw of 173-9, his second best
ever, and Dave Pickett's javelin throw of 212-5, his per
sonal record by about 18 feet. Pickett's improved toss was
all the more impressing considering it came in a year when
the NCAA instituted a new, heavier javelin which cuts
back on a thrower's distance.
In the women's meet, senior Pam Dukes qualified for
the NCAA Championships in the discus with a throw of
172-7. She was closely followed by her teammate Karen
Nickerson who threw 171. Nickerson has already
qualified for the NCA As with a season best of 181.
In an effort to qualify more of the women for the
NCA As, Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson had also taken
eight of his athletes to Florida where they took part in the
Florida State Invitational.
It wasn't the best meet for the Cardinal, but a few of the
women were able to withstand the humidity and high tem
pertatures and place in the meet. Running in the 400
hurdles, junior Pam Board and freshman Dawn Wilson
placed second and third, respectively.
Senior heptathlete Denise Gatzimbide placed third in
the high jump and sixth in the javelin. High jumper Lisa
Bernhagen didn't compete because of sickness.
Now wearing the jersey of the Puma Track Club, Patti
Sue Plumer, a 1985 Stanford graduate, was named Ath
lete of the Meet. Plumer dominated the meet's distances
races, winning the 1,500, the 3,000 and the 5,000.
