40 Westerners leave West Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Warring Christian and Moslem militiamen
stopped their sniper gunfire yesterday morning to allow about 40
Westerners, mostly Britons, to cross from West to East Beirut amid
growing fears for their safety.
A convoy of two police buses and four private cars left the seaside
Carlton Hotel, where the group had gathered, at 7:30 a.m. British Am
bassador John Gray greeted the evacuees, mostly doctors, teachers and
journalists, at the British Embassy in East Beirut.
Security sources said at least two U.S. citizens, one Irishman and one
New Zealander were among the group. A few Britons remained in West
Beirut, the sources added, but declined to give the number.
The evacuees are expected to leave for Cyprus during the next few
days.
The convoy was escorted by jeeps with mounted cannons and heavily
armed Druse and Shia militiamen from the newly organized Strike
Force, an intermilitia unit charged with security in West Beirut.
The evacuation was decided after the corpses of two kidnapped
Britons and one American were found in the Lebanese mountains
outside Beirut on Thursday. On the same day, a British cameraman,
John McCarthy, 29, was abducted on his way to the airport to catch a
flight to London.
A note found near the bodies of the three murdered Westerners
promised the kidnapping and killing of more British and American
citizens to avenge the U.S. air raid on Libya last Tuesday. The note was
signed by the Arab Fedayeen Cells, a group believed to be led by Pales
tinian Abu Nidal.
The convoy used the museum gateway to cross from the west portion
of the city. Security sources said arrangements were made with warring
factions to stop sniping fire during the transit.
The evacuation came amid growing tension in the Lebanese capital
where all crossings linking Moslem West with Christian East Beirut —
except for one through the southern suburbs — have been closed for the
last few days by sniper fire and sporadic fighting along the Green Line
dividing the city.
Aquino desires talks with rebels
MANILA — President Corazon Aquino, stepping up efforts for
reconciliation with the country's armed communist insurgents, indicated
yesterday that she does not expect rebel leaders to respond sincerely to
her call for a negotiated peace, but she said she is "willing to take the
gamble to avoid any further waste of life."
Her statement followed two major highway ambushes Friday and Sat
urday in which guerrillas killed a total of 35 soldiers, according to the
state-run Philippine News Agency. In both cases, the government was
reported to have launched large operations in retaliation.
In her second major policy speech since coming to power in a
popularly backed military revolt in February, Aquino appealed to the
communists to recognize that with President Ferdinand Marcos gone,
they no longer enjoy an advantage over the government in the people's
eyes.
Yesterday's speech reiterated key points raised in a March 22 address
by Aquino at the Philippines Military Academy in which she warned that
a "reformed and reinvigorated" armed forces would pursue those failing
to answer her call for national reconciliation.
The communist New People's Army is estimated to have about 15,000
armed guerrillas in the field and many times that number of sympat
hizers. Bringing the insurgency under control is viewed by the Aquino
government as one of its most important tasks.
Unity prospects dim in Zimbabwe
HARARE, Zimbabwe — Despite two recent unity rallies staged with
government approval, prospects of a merger between Prime Minister
Robert Mugabe's ruling party and that of opposition leader Joshua
Nkomo remain clouded in uncertainty, according to political analysts
and western diplomats.
A bitter public statement last weekend by Nkomo at the funeral of a
longtime lieutenant who had been detained by the government, as well
as an embarrassing public dispute in Parliament that revealed fissures
inside Mugabe's party, suggest an agreement between the two parties is
still distant.
An unusually candid editorial in Thursday's Harare Herald, which of
ten reflects official thinking, said the two recent events "deal crippling
blows to the unity talks."
Mugabe himself, in an address Thursday night marking the sixth an
niversary of Zimbabwe's independence, called national unity "a funda
mental objective." But Mugabe also indicated that Nkomo and his fol
lowers must be prepared to join the ruling party rather than have the two
sides form a new party — an issue that has been a major sticking point in
the talks.
Many observers believe some sort of agreement is inevitable between
the two men, who fell out in 1982 when Mugabe accused Nkomo of plot
ting a coup, then dismissed him from the Cabinet.
S. Africa steals body to stop rally
BUMBANE, South Africa — The body of the late king of South
Africa's five million Xhosas was stolen by government officials and
hurriedly buried here yesterday to prevent his funeral from becoming a
mass anti-apartheid rally.

ders barring them from burying the king, seized the body of Chief Sabata
Dalindyebo from a mortuary, brought it here to the royal seat of the
Tembu clan and buried it with the protection of more than 500 armed
soldiers and policemen.

paramount chief in his place by South Africa and became the Transkei
president when it was given nominal independence 10 years ago. per
sonally supervised the burial — as if to dramatize his final victory over
the man who had called him "a usurper, scoundrel and traitor."
Sabata's closest relatives, including Winnie Mandela, wife of the im
prisoned African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, the king's
uncle, learned only later in Umtata, Transkei's capital, of the burial.
Tens of thousands of Xhosas were prepared to come to Transkei in
convoys of buses from around the country to bury Sabata, not just as
traditional Xhosa leader but as a senior member of the outlawed African
National Congress and a staunch opponent of South Africa's apartheid
system.
Sabata. who was 57, died in exile earlier this month in Lusaka. Zam

40 Westerners leave West Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Warring Christian and Moslem militiamen
stopped their sniper gunfire yesterday morning to allow about 40
Westerners, mostly Britons, to cross from West to East Beirut amid
growing fears for their safety.
A convoy of two police buses and four private cars left the seaside
Carlton Hotel, where the group had gathered, at 7:30 a.m. British Am
bassador John Gray greeted the evacuees, mostly doctors, teachers and
journalists, at the British Embassy in East Beirut.
Security sources said at least two U.S. citizens, one Irishman and one
New Zealander were among the group. A few Britons remained in West
Beirut, the sources added, but declined to give the number.
The evacuees are expected to leave for Cyprus during the next few
days.
The convoy was escorted by jeeps with mounted cannons and heavily
armed Druse and Shia militiamen from the newly organized Strike
Force, an intermilitia unit charged with security in West Beirut.
The evacuation was decided after the corpses of two kidnapped
Britons and one American were found in the Lebanese mountains
outside Beirut on Thursday. On the same day, a British cameraman,
John McCarthy, 29, was abducted on his way to the airport to catch a
flight to London.
A note found near the bodies of the three murdered Westerners
promised the kidnapping and killing of more British and American
citizens to avenge the U.S. air raid on Libya last Tuesday. The note was
signed by the Arab Fedayeen Cells, a group believed to be led by Pales
tinian Abu Nidal.
The convoy used the museum gateway to cross from the west portion
of the city. Security sources said arrangements were made with warring
factions to stop sniping fire during the transit.
The evacuation came amid growing tension in the Lebanese capital
where all crossings linking Moslem West with Christian East Beirut —
except for one through the southern suburbs — have been closed for the
last few days by sniper fire and sporadic fighting along the Green Line
dividing the city.
Aquino desires talks with rebels
MANILA — President Corazon Aquino, stepping up efforts for
reconciliation with the country's armed communist insurgents, indicated
yesterday that she does not expect rebel leaders to respond sincerely to
her call for a negotiated peace, but she said she is "willing to take the
gamble to avoid any further waste of life."
Her statement followed two major highway ambushes Friday and Sat
urday in which guerrillas killed a total of 35 soldiers, according to the
state-run Philippine News Agency. In both cases, the government was
reported to have launched large operations in retaliation.
In her second major policy speech since coming to power in a
popularly backed military revolt in February, Aquino appealed to the
communists to recognize that with President Ferdinand Marcos gone,
they no longer enjoy an advantage over the government in the people's
eyes.
Yesterday's speech reiterated key points raised in a March 22 address
by Aquino at the Philippines Military Academy in which she warned that
a "reformed and reinvigorated" armed forces would pursue those failing
to answer her call for national reconciliation.
The communist New People's Army is estimated to have about 15,000
armed guerrillas in the field and many times that number of sympat
hizers. Bringing the insurgency under control is viewed by the Aquino
government as one of its most important tasks.
Unity prospects dim in Zimbabwe
HARARE, Zimbabwe — Despite two recent unity rallies staged with
government approval, prospects of a merger between Prime Minister
Robert Mugabe's ruling party and that of opposition leader Joshua
Nkomo remain clouded in uncertainty, according to political analysts
and western diplomats.
A bitter public statement last weekend by Nkomo at the funeral of a
longtime lieutenant who had been detained by the government, as well
as an embarrassing public dispute in Parliament that revealed fissures
inside Mugabe's party, suggest an agreement between the two parties is
still distant.
An unusually candid editorial in Thursday's Harare Herald, which of
ten reflects official thinking, said the two recent events "deal crippling
blows to the unity talks."
Mugabe himself, in an address Thursday night marking the sixth an
niversary of Zimbabwe's independence, called national unity "a funda
mental objective." But Mugabe also indicated that Nkomo and his fol
lowers must be prepared to join the ruling party rather than have the two
sides form a new party — an issue that has been a major sticking point in
the talks.
Many observers believe some sort of agreement is inevitable between
the two men, who fell out in 1982 when Mugabe accused Nkomo of plot
ting a coup, then dismissed him from the Cabinet.
S. Africa steals body to stop rally
BUMBANE, South Africa — The body of the late king of South
Africa's five million Xhosas was stolen by government officials and
hurriedly buried here yesterday to prevent his funeral from becoming a
mass anti-apartheid rally.

ders barring them from burying the king, seized the body of Chief Sabata
Dalindyebo from a mortuary, brought it here to the royal seat of the
Tembu clan and buried it with the protection of more than 500 armed
soldiers and policemen.

the man who had called him "a usurper, scoundrel and traitor."
