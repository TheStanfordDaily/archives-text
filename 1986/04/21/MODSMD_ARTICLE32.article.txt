# Khadafy is suffering depression

WASHINGTON and LONDON
â€” Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy sank into a severe depres
sion after last week's U.S. bombing
raid that wounded two of his sons and
killed a 15-month-old girl described
by Libyan officials as his adopted
daughter, according to a reliable in
telligence report reaching officials
here.
Khadafy has begun displaying the
extravagant mood swings of a manic
depressive, the sources said. Central
Intelligence Agency specialists have
concluded that the bombing raid,
which apparently caught Khadafy
completely by surprise, triggered the
depression. They said he was particu
larly affected by the wounding of the
sons, one of whom remains in serious
condition.
Meanwhile, there were some
strong indications from sources yes
terday that the United States is close
to proving that Libya is responsible
for the shooting last week of William
Calkins, a U.S. Embassy communica
tions specialist in Khartoum. Calkins
was shot the day after the U.S. raid
and a bullet inflicted a serious brain
injury.
The U.S. Embassy in Sudan last
week evacuated several hundred
"non-essential" personnel and all

dependents. For nearly a year there
have been U.S. intelligence reports
that Libya planned attacks on
Americans and U.S. facilities in
Sudan, sources said.
President Reagan and other offi
cials have said that the United States
will strike at Libya again if the
Khadafy-sponsored terrorism contin
ues.

Khadafy's sluggish personal
response seems to have somewhat
delayed the Libyan reaction to last
Tuesday's U.S. air strike in which
more than 100 tons of bombs were
dropped on five targets including his
personal headquarters, called the Bab
Azizzia, or "Splendid Gate," bar
racks.
An intelligence source predicted

that Khadafy would soon cycle back
into his familiar mold as a wild, out
spoken leader, and in all likelihood
will begin planning retaliation against
the United States. "A lamb one day
and a lion the next," said one well
placed source.
Khadafy, according to reliable
reports, also has used excessive
amounts of sleeping pills and
stimulants. Last month, Newsweek
magazine reported that an updated
CIA profile said Khadafy was using
hallucinogens, and that one source
conferring with him during the Gulf
of Sidra exercises last month found
him "disoriented and incomprehen
sible."
Meanwhile, in London, Foreign
Secretary Geoffrey Howe refused
yesterday to rule out the possibility of
U.S. aircraft launching another air
strike against Libya from bases in
Britain.
Asked during a nationally televised
hour-long interview if Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government
would consent to the use of British
bases again, Howe replied, "That
cannot be absolutely excluded in the
nature of the world in which we live."
"Britain is in the front-line of
Libyan-directed state terrorism," he
declared.
