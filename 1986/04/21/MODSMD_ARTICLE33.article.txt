EAST BERLIN â€” Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev said yesterday that a U.S.-Soviet summit
meeting could go ahead this year despite the recent
rise in East-West tension, but he warned that if the
Reagan Administration continues its present
course, "a shadow will be thrown over all plans for
a future summit."
In his first direct statement on prospects for a
meeting with President Reagan since the U.S. raid
on Libya last week, Gorbachev said a summit
meeting would take place if the United States
agrees "it is necessary to take this path." The So
viet Union, he added, is "ready to take realistic
steps along the path to peace."
However, referring to the Libya bombing and
recent U.S. nuclear tests, Gorbachev said that if the
Americans "continue to act as they do today, if
they continue to make the international situation
explosive and to drive away the spirit of Geneva,
then 1 think a shadow will be thrown over all plans
for a future summit. That should be thought over in
Washington."
Gorbachev said that "if a new summit is to be or
ganized, then there must be an atmosphere in inter

national relations that allows for real hopes that the
summit will be a step forward." He added that
"from our side, we are ready for a new series of
steps."
Responding to Gorbachev's comments, the
White House said yesterday it assumed this year's
summit would occur as scheduled and that it was
ready to discuss a wide range of issues with Mos
cow, including terrorism. A White House state
ment said a summit this year in the United States
was in the best interest of both countries.
Gorbachev, on his first visit to East Germany
since taking power last year, has been attending the
congress of the ruling Socialist Unity Party here.
The Soviet leader's remarks came in response to
a journalist's question during a tour by the Soviet
delegation yesterday of the Cecilienhof Palace in
Potsdam, where the Potsdam Conference on the
future of Europe was held by Allied leaders in Au
gust 1945.
Gorbachev's statement expanded on a speech he
delivered to the East German communist congress
on Friday that also suggested a willingness to ad
vance U.S.-Soviet talks despite what he described

as a general trend of "militaristic and aggressive
U.S. actions." Gorbachev said then that all of Mos
cow's arms proposals are "still valid" and offered
what he called "a new initiative" on the reduction
of conventional military forces in Europe.
Reagan and Gorbachev agreed at their first
meeting in Geneva last November to hold summit
talks this year and in 1987. Since then, the Soviets
have delayed setting a date for the meeting and
Gorbachev has appeared several times to link the
scheduling of the summit to progress in arms con
trol negotiations.
Gorbachev also has proposed meeting Reagan in
a European capital to conclude a treaty banning
nuclear testing, an offer rejected by Washington.
His statement did not make clear whether he
remained open to a summit meeting in the United
States that was not linked to the arms talks.
On Thursday, East German communist leader
Erich Honecker delivered a speech endorsing the
idea of a U.S.-Soviet summit for banning nuclear
testing, and, as Gorbachev looked on, did not men
tion the Geneva agreement for summit talks.
