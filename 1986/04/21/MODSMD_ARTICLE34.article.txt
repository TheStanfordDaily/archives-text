U.S. presses offensive
WASHINGTON — The United States is
pressing its European allies for a new joint offen
sive against terrorism and plans to make the issue
a central concern at next month's Tokyo summit
of industrial democracies. President Reagan's
chief of staff said yesterday.
In the wake of last week's U.S. air strike
against Libya, White House Chief of Staff
Donald Regan contended that other Western
governments increasingly support the Reagan
Administration's tough approach on terrorism —
even if some still object to military action.
State Department officials said the Adminis
tration has told European governments since the
raid that one way to forestall further U.S.
military action against Libya would be to institute
joint political and economic sanctions against
Khadafy.
A series of meetings is planned this week
among counterterrorism officials of the seven na

tions participating in the Tokyo summit to discuss
possible joint measures, one said.
"We are now talking with our allies, telling
them they have made a poor decision in not sup
porting us in this endeavor," Regan said bluntly
in an NBC television interview with columnist
John McLaughlin.
Of the United States' major allies, only Britain
has offered forthright support for the air strike
against Khadafy's Tripoli headquarters and four
other military bases. West Germany, Italy and
Canada have said they support tough measures
against Khadafy but expressed misgivings about
the Administration's tactic. France, which did not
give permission to allow U.S. Air Force bombers
to cross its territory on their way from bases in
Britain to Libya, has been publicly critical.
Drugs in Rio Grande
EL PASO, Texas — Federal agents say that
just southeast of here, tons of marijuana,

protected by Mexico's Federal Judicial Police
and the local Chihuahua state police, regularly
roll into the Mexican town of La Isla, a dusty col
lection of small houses built of scrap metal and
adobe.
Based just across the Rio Grande River from
Fabens, Texas, the drug traffickers rely on the in
centive of poverty to provide a small army of
backpackers, eager to earn up to $200 a trip by
strapping 100 pounds of marijuana to their backs
and wading across the river to "stash houses" on
the U.S. side. A 4,400-pound load of marijuana
was seized on the northern side of the border ear
lier this month.
To the east and the west, federal law enforce
ment officials say the picture is much the same.
Marijuana in record quantities is streaming
across the border on foot and in four-wheel drive
vehicles. Overhead, low-flying planes carry
cocaine and heroin, landing at private airstrips,
on straight stretches of highway or even in the
desert.
