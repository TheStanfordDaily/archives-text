Titan blast investigated
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE — A
wide-ranging Air Force investigation into last
week's Titan rocket launch explosion will focus
on "O" rings in its solid fuel boosters and even
the possibility of sabotage.
"We will be looking at everything . . . (the
solid fuel) boosters, rings, propellants and
electronics," said Maj. Gen. Jack Watkins, com
mander of the Ist Strategic Aerospace Division
here.
Watkins would not speculate about the cause
of the explosion, but he did say that one concern
is the "ring connectors on the solid rocket
booster."
Public awareness of the critical role of "O
rings, which seal the segments of the solid rock
ets. has been heightened since the destruction of
the space shuttle Challenger in January. Rings in
one of its solid boosters are believed to have
failed, allowing searing rocket gases to burn
through the side.
The $65 million Titan 34D that blew up five
seconds into launch Friday morning carried a
classified payload. Its failure, coupled with the
shuttle disaster, interrupts the launch programs
of the United State's two principal satellite
launch vehicles.
The solid rockets used for Titan launches are
manufactured by United Technologies, Chemical

Systems Division of Sunnyvale. Those used by
the space shuttle are made by Morton Thiokol
Inc. of Brigham City, Utah.
Libya attack deplored
APTOS — The family of slain American
hostage Peter Kilburn yesterday condemned the
U.S. government for its attack on Libya and said
they feel it will escalate violence in the area.
"I don't think Peter will be the only one that
will be sacrificed," Jeanne Repetto, Kilburn's
sister-in-law, said in an interview.
Repetto compared the U.S. air raid on Libya
to throwing a bomb into the night and trying to
kill a mosquito.
"By throwing the bomb out the window, we've
blown out the window, breaking whatever
protection we had. and now we have found that,
instead, we hit a hornet's nest. I shudder to think
about what will happen," said Repetto, 56, of
San Jose.
Kilburn, 62, was killed last week apparently in
retaliation for the U.S. air raid on Libya. His
body was flown to the United States yesterday
and positively identified, a State Department
spokesman said.
Kilburn, of San Francisco, was librarian at the
American University of Beirut for 20 years until
he disappeared on Dec. 3, 1984.

"Peter was very peaceful," said Repetto. "He
loved the Lebanese people. That's the ironic part
about it (his death)."
LAX tightens security
LOS ANGELES— Police have been deployed
to create an obvious presence at Los Angeles In
ternational Airport as a deterrent to terrorists
and assurance to travelers, Mayor Tom Bradley
said yesterday.
"Airport staff have tightened the screws by
giving airport personnel special briefings, putting
additional staff on duty, especially high-visibility
uniformed officers, and increasing communica
tions with various local and federal agencies and
with the airlines," Bradley told reporters.
Bradley's announcement was typical of local
reaction to fear of terrorism in the aftermath of
the U.S. air raid on Libya. Other airports and es
pecially Southern California's many military
bases have tightened security.
