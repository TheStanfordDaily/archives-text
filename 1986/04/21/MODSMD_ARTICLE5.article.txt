which I love and > ior more than I
can say."
He also lauded Kennedy for his in
spiration and "solicitude for my

welfare."
Hamerton-Kelly called Memorial
Church "strong and vibrant. There is
a unified and dedicated congregation,
full of good plans for the future, and
the extraordinarily rich programming
for this current quarter, along with
the optimism and zeal which our
members feel, seems like a fitting
climax to my ministry here."
Hamerton-Kelly. a South African
native, came to the University in
1972, the same year he became a
U.S. citizen, after teaching at Scripps
College and Claremont Graduate
School from 1965-1970.

then, in the providence of God, to
resume my career in the church."
Hamerton-Kelly told The Daily he
is interested in writing a book about
Jesus and Saint Paul that will have
"an interesting slant that will contrib

erence to his decision to resign 14
years after taking the position of dean
of the chapel.
"Seven is a significant number in
the Biblical tradition: God rested on
the seventh day from his labors in
creation, and we have patterned our
understanding of Sabbath on that
tradition. I have enjoyed the privilege
and borne the burdens of my present
office for a period that will total twice
seven years, and I believe the time
has come for me to seek respite and
explore new ways of service." he said.
