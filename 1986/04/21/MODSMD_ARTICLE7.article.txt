# Affirmative Action at Stanford gets mixed reviews
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
This is the second in a series of articles focusing on the
University's Affirmative Action plan.
Although Stanford's faculty, staff and student body
continues to diversify, University officials admit there are
many areas which continue to show disappointing per
centages of women and minority participation.
University administrators touted overall gains for
women and certain targeted groups at a Faculty Senate
meeting Thursday. But the administrators also expressed
concern about the levels of minorities in graduate studies
and senior management positions and a general
"skewing" of minorities to non-professional, lower
paying jobs.
Statistics presented by Provost James Rosse show the
total number of women on the 1,295-member Academic
Council dropped from 136 to 128 in this academic year.
Despite the recent drop, the University has maintained
"steady but slow progress" in women and minority faculty
appointments, Rosse said.
Minority faculty increased from 87 to 96 positions.
Minorities account for 7 percent and women 10 percent of
the total faculty.
In Graduate Studies, women account for about 30 per
cent of enrollment in both masters and doctoral studies.
Targeted minorities comprise about 6 percent of the
7,388 graduate students who attend Stanford.
The low level of women and minorities in senior man
agement is, however, "without question the biggest prob
lem at Stanford," said Santiago Rodriguez, University af
firmative action officer. "Senior management almost
without exception tends to be white male."
Although there have been several recent "stellar" ap

pointments of women to senior positions, such as Dean of
Admissions Jean Fetter, Facilities and Serv ices Director
Amy Blue and Vice-Provost and Dean of Graduate
Studies Elizabeth Traugott, Rodriguez said Stanford has
"no similar appointments for minorities at all."
"That's severely troublesome, because a very logical
and critical argument is how can we set an example if we
don't have the people at the top," Rodriguez said. "If di
versity is (an institution's) premise, then diversity at the
top becomes crucial because that is where a lot of the tone
is set."
Contributing to the lack of minorities in senior manage
ment is a perception among minority non-academic staff
employees that Stanford provides few opportunities for
upward career mobility, Rodriguez said.
Stanford may consider program changes such as in
creased planning, worker training, "mentoring" and pos
sibly "tracking" employees as some corporations do in an
effort to alleviate this problem, Rodriguez said.
Total minority participation in the Stanford workforce,
however, has been "inching up very slowly" over the last
five to seven years, Rodriguez said. Minority representa
tion in the non-academic staff is approaching 25 percent.
Despite this increase, administrators are concerned that
"more minorities than not tend to be in non-exempt
(hourly) jobs and the lower levels of the professional
jobs," Rodriguez said.
Although overall participation by Asian Americans is
"not bad," Rodriguez said they are similarly skewed to
the often stereotypical careers in health and technical
related fields and not in managerial positions.
Another source of concern continues to be the virtual
stagnation of minority enrollment in the graduate division
of the School of Humanities and Sciences. This reflects a
national trend of "slippage" in minority enrollment which

begun 10 years ago. Rodriguez said.
At a time when minorities comprise over 50 percent of
the population in California kindergarten, elementary and
secondary schools — a trend also reflected nationally —
the prospect of limited or no growth in potential minority
faculty worries Stanford and other universities. Rodriguez
said.
To supplement usual affirmative action efforts, the Uni
versity established the Faculty Affirmative Action Fund
to provide financial assistance to schools hiring new
minority faculty.
Following recommendations from department heads
and deans, the fund allows the provost to help pay for new
billets, or faculty positions, for "outstanding" minority
candidates who might not meet existing position requir
ments, said Noel Kolak. assistant provost for faculty af
fairs.
The fund is usually used for partial rather than full
funding of billets to clearly demonstrate departmental
committment to the value of the appointment.
"Generally speaking, I prefer to be your partner in
these transactions because I belive it increases the depart
ment or school's committment to the individual
(apppointee)," Rosse said in a 1984 memo to school
deans. "Another obvious reason is that for the same
amount of money 1 would prefer to facilitate two affirma
tive action appointments ... as opposed to one."
Since its inception in 1971, the fund has provided
budget-base funding of over $951,000 for 70 faculty ap
pointments, Kolak said. An additional $852,000 has been
spent for one-time funding of campus visits and seminar
fees to help attract minority faculty candidates.
Stanford must also concentrate on matriculating
minority students who have been offered admission,
Traugott said. To help accomplish this, Stanford continues

a "substantial" financial aid committment to minority
graduate students, she said. About 25 percent of all
graduate fellowship money is awarded to minority stu
dents.
The outlook appears to be brighter for women, though.
Although women still comprise a majority ol the non
exempt, primarily clerical positions, they now also ac
count for over one-half ot all exempt jobs. The combined
Stanford staff is now almost two-thirds female, a figure
higher than most corporations, according to Rodriguez.
Unlike hispanics and blacks, the overall growth in the
number of women in non-traditional jobs contributes to
continued "spontaneous growth ot female participation
in all areas of Stanford, Rodriguez said.
"The 'critical mass" for women in many job occupations
has now been reached," Rodriguez said. "We're seeing
veiy competitive women show up in pools for job searches
(without special recruiting and) being selected.
Another bright spot is increased numbers of physically
limited or disabled students and staff, an increase which
corresponds to a growth "in all segments ot our popula
tion" of those who have self-identified disabilities,
Rodriguez said.
The increased disabled population represents greater
public awareness of the steps Stanford has taken to in
crease accessibility rather than particular recruiting ef
forts, said Jim Bouquin, director of disabled student
services.
"We're doing a good job right now in incorporating stu
dents and staff with disabilities," Bouquin said. "1 would
argue, though, that we still have a way to go before 1
would feel comfortable."
Problem areas are found by comparing the number ot
women and minority in the University workforce and stu
dent body to the number available in applicant pools.

women and certain targeted groups at a Faculty Senate
meeting Thursday. But the administrators also expressed
concern about the levels of minorities in graduate studies
and senior management positions and a general
"skewing" of minorities to non-professional, lower
paying jobs.
Statistics presented by Provost James Rosse show the
total number of women on the 1,295-member Academic
Council dropped from 136 to 128 in this academic year.
Despite the recent drop, the University has maintained
"steady but slow progress" in women and minority faculty
appointments, Rosse said.
Minority faculty increased from 87 to 96 positions.
Minorities account for 7 percent and women 10 percent of
the total faculty.
In Graduate Studies, women account for about 30 per
cent of enrollment in both masters and doctoral studies.
Targeted minorities comprise about 6 percent of the
7,388 graduate students who attend Stanford.
The low level of women and minorities in senior man
agement is, however, "without question the biggest prob
lem at Stanford," said Santiago Rodriguez, University af
firmative action officer. "Senior management almost
without exception tends to be white male."
Although there have been several recent "stellar" ap

pointments of women to senior positions, such as Dean of
Admissions Jean Fetter, Facilities and Serv ices Director
Amy Blue and Vice-Provost and Dean of Graduate
Studies Elizabeth Traugott, Rodriguez said Stanford has
"no similar appointments for minorities at all."
"That's severely troublesome, because a very logical
and critical argument is how can we set an example if we
don't have the people at the top," Rodriguez said. "If di
versity is (an institution's) premise, then diversity at the
top becomes crucial because that is where a lot of the tone
is set."
Contributing to the lack of minorities in senior manage
ment is a perception among minority non-academic staff
employees that Stanford provides few opportunities for
upward career mobility, Rodriguez said.
Stanford may consider program changes such as in
creased planning, worker training, "mentoring" and pos
sibly "tracking" employees as some corporations do in an
effort to alleviate this problem, Rodriguez said.
Total minority participation in the Stanford workforce,
however, has been "inching up very slowly" over the last
five to seven years, Rodriguez said. Minority representa
tion in the non-academic staff is approaching 25 percent.
Despite this increase, administrators are concerned that
"more minorities than not tend to be in non-exempt
(hourly) jobs and the lower levels of the professional
jobs," Rodriguez said.
Although overall participation by Asian Americans is
"not bad," Rodriguez said they are similarly skewed to
the often stereotypical careers in health and technical
related fields and not in managerial positions.
Another source of concern continues to be the virtual
stagnation of minority enrollment in the graduate division
of the School of Humanities and Sciences. This reflects a
national trend of "slippage" in minority enrollment which

begun 10 years ago. Rodriguez said.
At a time when minorities comprise over 50 percent of
the population in California kindergarten, elementary and
secondary schools — a trend also reflected nationally —
the prospect of limited or no growth in potential minority
faculty worries Stanford and other universities. Rodriguez
said.
To supplement usual affirmative action efforts, the Uni
versity established the Faculty Affirmative Action Fund
to provide financial assistance to schools hiring new
minority faculty.
Following recommendations from department heads
and deans, the fund allows the provost to help pay for new
billets, or faculty positions, for "outstanding" minority
candidates who might not meet existing position requir
ments, said Noel Kolak. assistant provost for faculty af
fairs.
The fund is usually used for partial rather than full
funding of billets to clearly demonstrate departmental
committment to the value of the appointment.
"Generally speaking, I prefer to be your partner in
these transactions because I belive it increases the depart
ment or school's committment to the individual
(apppointee)," Rosse said in a 1984 memo to school
deans. "Another obvious reason is that for the same
amount of money 1 would prefer to facilitate two affirma
tive action appointments ... as opposed to one."
Since its inception in 1971, the fund has provided
budget-base funding of over $951,000 for 70 faculty ap
pointments, Kolak said. An additional $852,000 has been
spent for one-time funding of campus visits and seminar
fees to help attract minority faculty candidates.
Stanford must also concentrate on matriculating
minority students who have been offered admission,
Traugott said. To help accomplish this, Stanford continues

a "substantial" financial aid committment to minority
graduate students, she said. About 25 percent of all
graduate fellowship money is awarded to minority stu
dents.
The outlook appears to be brighter for women, though.
Although women still comprise a majority ol the non
exempt, primarily clerical positions, they now also ac
count for over one-half ot all exempt jobs. The combined
Stanford staff is now almost two-thirds female, a figure
higher than most corporations, according to Rodriguez.
Unlike hispanics and blacks, the overall growth in the
number of women in non-traditional jobs contributes to
continued "spontaneous growth ot female participation
in all areas of Stanford, Rodriguez said.
"The 'critical mass" for women in many job occupations
has now been reached," Rodriguez said. "We're seeing
veiy competitive women show up in pools for job searches
(without special recruiting and) being selected.
Another bright spot is increased numbers of physically
limited or disabled students and staff, an increase which
corresponds to a growth "in all segments ot our popula
tion" of those who have self-identified disabilities,
Rodriguez said.
The increased disabled population represents greater
public awareness of the steps Stanford has taken to in
crease accessibility rather than particular recruiting ef
forts, said Jim Bouquin, director of disabled student
services.
"We're doing a good job right now in incorporating stu
dents and staff with disabilities," Bouquin said. "1 would
argue, though, that we still have a way to go before 1
would feel comfortable."
Problem areas are found by comparing the number ot
women and minority in the University workforce and stu
dent body to the number available in applicant pools.
This is the second in a series of articles focusing on the
University's Affirmative Action plan.
Although Stanford's faculty, staff and student body
continues to diversify, University officials admit there are
many areas which continue to show disappointing per
centages of women and minority participation.
