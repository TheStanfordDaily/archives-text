The Grateful Dead are scheduled to
liven up the Frost Amphitheatre May 11
and 12, and promoters hope the group's
appearance here will become annual.
"They love playing at Frost," said Jim
Durkin, promotions manager for the Con
cert Network. "They said they want to
play annually at Frost, so as long as the
Grateful Dead is a group, we should be
able to get a concert with them every year.
"It was pretty much understood by Bill
Graham and ourselves at the Concert Net

work that we were going to do a concert
this year. The contract is virtually identical
to last year's," Durkin said. Bill Graham
Presents is the Bay Area's leading concert
promoter.
Last spring, the Dead celebrated their
20th anniversary of performing in the
Stanford area with a Concert Network
sponsored performance in Frost.
Concert Network Director Patrick
O'Hara said students should hurry if they
want to get tickets because the "Grateful
Dead almost always sell out.''
Tickets for the events will go on sale
today for Stanford students, faculty and

staff, and April 23 for the general public.
The cost will be $14 for students and $16
for others.
Stanford students will be allowed to buy
two tickets with each student ID pre
sented at the ticket booth, up to a maxi
mum of eight tickets; however, only stu
dents may use student tickets, according
to O'Hara.
"This (the ticket policy) will be strictly
enforced since IDs will be checked at the
door, and anyone holding a student ticket
must also have a student ID," O'Hara
said.
