# Prof. describes ancient Stanford

Stanford land should be declared a
preserve in order to allow archaeologists to
uncover Stanford's prehistory, according to
John Rick, assistant professor of anthropol
ogy. "We need a preserve to redefine our
chronology and refine our model," he said.
An archaeological site on campus, discov
ered in the late 19705, "jarred" scientists'
model of where the ancient Costanoan
people lived, according to Rick. The dig is
located behind the Stanford Children's
Hospital.

Rick told a group of 70 people Friday
night that Stanford West excavation does
not support a theory that prehistoric natives
had only two permanent villages along a
"long linear" area near the San Francisquito
stream.
Based on what food sources were
available for the hunter/gatherer 5,000
years ago, the students and Rick believed
the natives would migrate up to an area in
Jasper Ridge.
Major urban development has left very
little land open to study the ancient civiliza

tions in the area, according to Rick. "This
new excavation is also valuable for this rea
son because it hasn't been developed." A
preserve will help anthropologists in the
future to discover the ways the land was
used around all of this area, he stressed.
The site "brought us back to reality" Rick
said. "Our model is not perfect because this
site is at a mid-altitude point." The finding
of a burial ground has supported the idea
that the site was a permanent one and fur
ther excavating could show signs of a small
village.
