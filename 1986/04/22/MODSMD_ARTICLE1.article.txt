# Housing draw to begin
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The lottery drums begin spinning
today, tumbling the numbers that will
determine where students vying for
on-campus housing will reside next
year.
Round I of the annual housing
Draw gets underway today at 9 a.m.
at the Clubhouse in Old Union, as
students turn in housing cards and
pluck Draw numbers that are used in
the allocation of University housing.
Students guaranteed of on-campus
housing will draw from a drum con
taining numbers ranging from l to
3,000, while students with un
guaranteed status will select from a
drum of numbers ranging from 3,001
to 5,000, according to Rodger Whit
ney, director of the University
Housing Office. Until last year, all
students chose from the same pool of
numbers between 1 and 5,000.
Approximately 4,000 students will
take part in this week's Draw, Whit
ney said, noting that the Califor
nia State Lottery is the theme for this
year's event.
Initial results from Round I will be
announced no later than mid-May,
Whitney said, at which time students
can accept their housing assignments
or drop out of the Draw. If students
take neither action, they will auto
matically be entered in the second
round, he said.
Although no new numbers are
drawn in Round 11, students have the
opportunity to move up to higher
placed choices on their housing cards,
Whitney said. He noted that students
move up as others drop out of the
Draw to join fraternities or become
resident assistants.
"Most people will stay in (the
Draw)," Whitney said.
Whitney advised students to "put
down the houses in the order they
want to live in them and not to try to
guess from last year's cutoffs," adding
that "you can never predict" a Draw
assignment based on cutoffs from
past years.
Residences that annually are stu
dents' top choices include Storey
House, 558 Mayfield, 353 Campus
Drive and Murray and Yost houses,
Whitney said.
Rather than flooding each Draw
card only with the choices that fill up
quickly, Whitney urged students to
put down "a few general houses"
such as Wilbur and Stern Halls.
Whitney also encouraged students
to get priorities from the residences

they list on their housing cards, in
creasing the chances of living in a
desired residence.
A staff of students will monitor the
drawings, which will run through
Friday from 9 a.m. to noon and 1:15

p.m. to 4:30 p.m., Whitney said.
Whitney said preparation for the
Draw has "been going Relatively
smoothly" and few label changes
have been made on students' housing
cards.
