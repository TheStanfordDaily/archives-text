# On-campus recruiting enjoys successful year

### STUART BLOCK 
The 1985-86 school year has been a strong
one for on-campus job recruiting at Stanford,
according to Chris Shinkman, director of the
University's Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC).
Since September, approximately 400
recruiters have visited campus in search of po
tential employees, with 300 of the representa
tives seeking technical graduates and 100 desir
ing students with non-technical backgrounds.
The number of interviews peaked during win
ter quarter, with about 100 meetings scheduled
per day.
Recruiting this year has proven especially
beneficial to those "high-tech" students with
bachelor's or master's degrees in either engi
neering or computer science, Shinkman said.
He added that after a year of slow growth and
low hiring, Silicon Valley firms have rebounded
to show the greatest comparative interest in
Stanford students, based on the percentage of
total interviews.
Shinkman, while not downplaying the role of
Stanford's academic reputation, credits a por
tion of Silicon Valley's extensive recruitment to
its proximity to campus.
Also evident this year has been the increased
opportunities for liberal arts students, particu
larly graduates of Stanford's Teacher Education
Program (STEP).
Shinkman said he sees the "resurgence in
school districts seeking teaching candidates . . .

as a result of faculties growing older simultane
ously.
Despite the increased demand, starting
salaries for teachers remain low, between
$ 19,000 and $21,000 annually.
Two other areas of interest are the Peace
Corps, whose popularity Shinkman attributes to
its "great value as an interim experience," and
real estate, a field that has been generally
ignored by Stanford students in past years.
While only the larger corporations or those in
the Bay Area are likely to send recruiters to
campus, Shinkman reminds the job seeker that
small businesses as well as public and non-profit
organizations also offer many employment op
portunities.
There are no actual records of the number of
positions filled as the result of on-campus inter
viewing. because the process of job recruitment
and selection is long, often concluding well after
the school year has ended.
Following the on-campus meetings, success
ful students schedule a follow-up, on-site inter
ivew, often referred to as a fly-back. At this
time, the potential employee becomes better ac
quainted with the company and its surround
ings. "If all goes well, a student may receive
several offers," Shinkman says.
Results of past surveys show that about 50
percent of Stanford seniors accept full-time pos
itions after graduation, 30 percent go to
graduate school and 20 percent remain un
decided.
