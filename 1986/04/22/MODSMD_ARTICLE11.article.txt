A survey of life attitudes of Stan
ford students conducted by the
Stanford Baptist Student Fellow
ship found that one-fourth of stu
dents surveyed believe religion is a
vital aspect of their life.
Ken Yinger, the director of Bap
tist student fellowship on campus,
said his group handed out surveys
to a random selection of students in
White Plaza in March. The survey
posed questions to students on
broad selection of topics as diverse
as what their political views were to
whether they believed in God.
More then 2 percent of the Stan
ford student population, or 272 stu
dents, completed surveys.
According to Yinger the results
represented a broad cross-section
of students. Of the 272 people who

completed the survey, 57 percent
were undergraduates and 165 were
men.
Yinger said the purpose of the
survey was to "find out what people
are thinking about these things. We
wanted to gain an understanding of
where students were coming from.
"It does admittedly help us try
and more effectively share our
views with others," Yinger added.
Of students surveyed, 43 percent
said their life was influenced by
God, but only 23.95 felt that their
life was influenced by the church;
23.1 percent felt that God did not
exist at all. Substantially more men
than women believe that God does
not fexist.
Of the men who did believe that
God exists a large percentage
believed the God played an
"inactive" role in their life.

Yinger said that there was also a
high correlation in the survey be
tween politics and religion. More
than 60 percent of students classify
ing themselves as liberal politically
rated religion in their life to be not
very important. Sixty-seven percent
of students calling themselves con
servative found religion to be
moderately important in their lives.
And more than 67 percent of stu
dents calling themselves moderate
said that religion was very impor
tant if not vital to their lives.
Yinger said that the survey did
provide several surprises to himself
and his group. The most surprising
figure to him was that 76 percent of
people surveyed felt that man
would be on earth in the year 2525.
'With all this talk of nuclear war
and the nuclear holocaust I didn't
think people would be so positive,"
he said. â€ž . o
