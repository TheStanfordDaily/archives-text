# 2 fast over animal use
## 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Charging that their tax dollars
are spent on cruel and useless
animal research, two local residents
yesterday vowed to sit in White
Plaza and fast until Thursday morn
ing in protest of a Stanford scien
tist's work.
Dahl Stanley and Bob Smith,
who will confine themselves to a
wooden "cage" similar to those
used for laboratory primates, said
Stanford Psychiatry Prof. Seymour
Levine continues to do research on
the stressful effects of separating
infant monkeys from their mothers
despite conclusive studies already
completed on humans.
Stanley and Smith said they hope
to raise students' awareness that
such work is conducted here. "We
want to end (Levine's work),"
Stanley said. "When people don't
know, it's going to get worse.
"A lot (of Stanford students)
may be having a good life," Stanley
said. "They're unaware of what's
going on. But once they start
talking to us, they start asking intel
ligent questions. . . . We've had
some good conversations."
According to a statement issued
by the two demonstrators, Levine's
studies come to the obvious conclu
sions that "if you and your friends
are tortured together, you suffer
less fear than if you are tortured
alone" and "if you know you're
going to be stuck in traffic for 30
minutes, you're more apt to be up
set than if you don't know how long
you'll have to sit there."
Levine was not available for
comment last night.
Stanley said she and Smith will
drink water during their fast, which
will end at 9 a.m. Thursday, just
before a protest at the Stanford

Laboratory Animal Medicine
facility is scheduled to begin.
Animal research protesters plan
to demonstrate Thursday "with
militant, direct action protests" at
about 20 research facilities

nationwide, according to a state
ment by the April 24 Coalition, an
antivivisection organization.
The protest "may lead to
hundreds of arrests" nationwide,
the statement said.
