# South African says activism needed to prevent racial war
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Trans Africa lobbyist Randall Robinson told a Cubber
ley Auditorium audience last night that student activism
against apartheid is vital if Western nations are to win the
"race against time" by preventing an impending racial war
in South Africa.
"You make the tide, the politicians ride the crest,"
Robinson told a crowd of over 100. "When you go to
sleep, this country dies."
Robinson, who as director of TransAfrica, a pro
divestment lobbying group, played a leading role in spark
ing the national anti-apartheid movement more than a
year ago, also criticized U.S. corporations for their con
tinuing presence in South Africa.
"You don't tell people who want to vote to get a job at
General Motors," Robinson said, warning that unless ef
forts are made to "fight the ignorance in this country"
through total divestment from South Africa the blood of
tens of thousands "will be on the hands of America." He
added that U.S. universities have become similar to cor
porations, asking the Cubberley audience to consider
Stanford alumnus William Hewlett's recent $50 million
donation to the University alongside Stanford's involve
ment with the Hewlett-Packard Corp.'s investments in
South Africa.
"Your responsibility to the human family is more im

portant to being American," he stated. "We have an op
portunity to bring South Africa to the (bargaining) table."
Robinson ridiculed the idea that the white South
African government will eventually bring about reforms
of its own accord, saying that history proves the opposite.
"You do not give up power voluntarily. If I have power,
and you have caused it ... 1 will not give up that power
until it becomes my best available option," he said.
Robinson blamed a foreign policy that he said is based
on "ignorance" for the current U.S. policy toward South
Africa, citing the U.S. "declaration of war" against Libya
as an example of its "John Wayne attitude" toward the
world.
"Ignorance and power is a dangerous combination," he
said, warning that "we are seen from without quite differ
ently than from within."
Robinson argued that inaction in regard to apartheid in
South Africa is inexcusable, stating that there is "no
middle ground" on the issue.
"For those people who say, 'What does this have to do
with me?'. . . you are responsible, in part, for the killing of
thousands. You must never give up . . . because those who
tyrannize people count on apathy."
Quoting South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, Robin
son told the Cubberley crowd that "the blood that unites
us is thicker than the water which divides us."
"South Africa is a time bomb," he said. "Western
powers have a chance to give it a future."
