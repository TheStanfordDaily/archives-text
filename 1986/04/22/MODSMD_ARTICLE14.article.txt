# New antibody has potential

### STUART BLOCK 
Within the next few years, chicken
pox and Rh-factor blood incom
patability may be treated with
monoclonal antibodies — protein
"guided missiles" that are able to
zero in on specific targets in the body,
a Stanford researcher said recently.
Use of the antibodies is still "in the
lab testing [stage], two to three years
away," according to Dr. Steven
Foung, assistant professor of pathol
ogy at the medical school and assis
tant director of transfusion service at
Stanford Hospital.
But Foung and others at the Stan
ford Blood Center say they have
succeeded in simulating human an
tibodies with the ability to kill and/or
neutralize specific types of infections
and viruses.
Used most effectively as a
preventive measure to be adminis
tered within 48 hours of exposure to a
virus, monoclonal antibodies join
with the body's natural immune sys
tem in killing off or limiting the
spread of diseased cells.
Two of the new antibodies show
promise for use against varicella

zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox
and shingles.
While chickenpox is usually consid
ered a relatively mild disease — one
that doesn't require special treatment
in most normal individuals — it can
be fatal in children with weakened
immune systems, Foung said.
A second significant application of
monoclonal antibodies is in the pre
vention of hemolytic disease in new
borns, a condition caused by an Rh
factor blood type incompatability be
tween mother and child.
During delivery of a mother's first
Rh-positive child, some of the baby's
blood leaks into the mother. Treating
the new blood as a foreign substance,
the mother's body develops an
tibodies against it — antibodies that
will attack the developing fetus of a
second child.
According to Foung, monoclonal
antibodies can prevent an Rh
negative mother from mounting an
attack on the fetus of her second Rh
positive child.
Monoclonal antibodies are made
by fusing two types of cells. One cell
has the capacity to produce a specific
protein antibody that can locate in
the body such as a virus and target the

body's immune forces against it.
The other cell, which comes from a
tumor, has the capacity to grow
forever in the test tube. Together the
two cells are capable of manufactur
ing large quantities of highly specific
protein.
To date, workers in the blood cen
ter have developed "an efficient sys
tem"' for producing human
monoclonal antibodies in the labora
tory, Foung said.
First, researchers fuse together a
mouse and a human cell. They then
fuse the hybrid cell to a human cell in
a second fusion process.
Researchers say they would prefer
to generate human monoclonal an
tibodies for treating patients, but the
cells have often proved unstable, a
problem that has slowed progress
considerably, Foung said.
But the technique has already
gained use in medical diagnosis and
biomedical research, according to
Foung.
Foung predicted that within two to
five years, the antibodies will have a
significant impact on medical
practice, specifically in use against in
fectious agents such as bacteria and
viruses.
