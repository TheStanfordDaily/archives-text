### 
The time has come to do away with the fraternity
system as it now exists at Stanford. The University has
put up with fraternities' nonsense for long enough, and
now is the time to turn over their houses to the general
student body.
Last Saturday's incident, in which a freshman at
tending a Rush party was critically injured in a fight
near the Delta Upsilon house, is only one event in a se
ries of atrocities that have become synonymous with
the fraternity system here over the past few years. And
just when you thought you might have seen it all and
that would be the end of thoughtless fraternity actions,
the DUs the same night lit a couch on fire and threw it
out a third-story window.
The University has tried many methods to convince
the houses to clean up their act. Residential Education
has undertaken investigations of the system and even
kicked the Zeta Psi fraternity off campus five years ago,
yet the list of fraternity-related offenses keeps growing.
Of course, all fraternities are not the same, at least in
the number and seriousness of their offenses. Some
have done nothing. But beyond immediate incidents,
there lurks a tradition of sexism and elitism in all the
fraternities that has no place in a recognized institution
at Stanford. The University must realize that by allow
ing the fraternities to occupy some of the best housing

on campus, it is effectively condoning their activities.
One important question that has not often been
asked in the debate over fraternities is: Why does the
University allow closed organizations such as fraterni
ties to monopolize a central and desirable part of stu
dent housing? Why not open up those houses to the
Draw, thereby ridding the University of an unjusti
fiable nemesis and giving the student body as a whole a
fair chance to draw into those houses?
If fraternities wish to live as a unit, then they would
be welcome to find housing elsewhere, as fraternities at
other colleges and universities must do. If they wish to
remain unhoused, they would be on the same footing
as sororities, none of which have housing here.
The University and students would lose little by un
housing fraternities. Alternative parties abound, and
surely there would be even more in the absence of
Greek organizations. And there is no reason to believe
that the constructive contributions of campus groups,
including fraternities, would end. After all, one need
not be a fraternity brother to work for a good cause.
Threats from the University have accomplished
nothing. Administrators must now sit back and con
sider: Do we really want exclusive groups that are of
ten responsible for repulsive and violent acts living in
University housing at the center of student life?
