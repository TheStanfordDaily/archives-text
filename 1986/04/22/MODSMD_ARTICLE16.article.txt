## Western Culture is racist 
### 
Last quarter, in my Western Culture class, my professor
gave a short introductory speech justifying Stanford Uni
versity's requirement of a year-long study of European
culture. In his address, the professor argued that we live in
a society heavily influenced by European ideals. He felt
that this fact provided good enough reason for excluding
the examination of other cultures from our study of the
Western world. He ended his speech by suggesting the
possibility of St. Augustine actually being a black man.

I have heard the argument stating that the Western Cul
ture program is racist, but I not only see it as a racist es
tablishment, I see it as a continuation of an ignorance that
must be eradicated.
I can understand the professor's argument of the
United States being a country largely based upon
European culture, but the superiority of Europeaas im
plicit in this argument is ill-founded. Europeans came
over to the American continent, massacred the Indians
and introduced a well-established slave trade onto its
fresh soil.
Europeans have a history of forcing other cultures to
assimilate into their own culture and when the other cul
ture is militarily weaker or refuses to be absorbed, its
members are destroyed or enslaved.
The professors argument is just a continuation of this
European oppression. Just because European culture has
been influential does not justify it being the culture upon
which Stanford students must base their higher education.
Aristotle had some interesting ideas, but stimulating ideas
have also been put forth by Africans, Asians, Latin
Americans and countless others from non-European
backgrounds.
Racism is very much alive in this world, and it is a prob
lem that influences the lives of everyone. If one wishes to
solve this problem, one must understand it. I know all too
well the ideals put forth by white America, but does white
America understand the motivation behind black
America? Does white America understand the ideology
of any culture other than its own? Our U.S. educational
system is certainly not working to dissolve this ignorance.
If a visitor from another planet enrolled in any Stanford
Western Culture track, this is the knowledge he would
receive: black people did not exist until the invention of
the slave ship, women did not think, the Egyptians were a

colorless people and the colonization of America was a
wonderful event.
All my life I have been subject to the ideals of white so
ciety. My education has taught me that men like George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson were great individuals.
Well, I find it disgusting that this "great" nation of ours
honors people who enslaved other human beings. Men
such as these practiced an evil, and there is no excuse for
evil.
I find it disappointing that a University such as this one
can fail to see the injustice in a program ignoring the cul
tural contributions of a significant number of its student
body. My disappointment leads me to anger. The Western
Culture program is an evil that denies many students the
right to learn about their own cultures. I get sick and tired
of my race being talked about only in the context of
slavery. I get tired of reading the thoughts of white men
who probably would spit on me if they were alive to face
me today. ..â€ž

I know all too well the
ideals put forth by white
America, but does white
American understand the
motivation behind black
America?

I assume that this University exists in order to give stu
dents the ability to go out and make the world a better
place, but the current Western Culture program does not
promote this purpose. Stanford is sending many students
into the world with no knowledge of the challenges facing
people of color. Challenges based on beliefs and experi
ences, that have and will continue to influence all Ameri
can lives.
There must be something wrong with a program in
which a professor dubiously points out the possibility of a
great thinker being a black man.
