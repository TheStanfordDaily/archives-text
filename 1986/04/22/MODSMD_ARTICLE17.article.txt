New rule insures
access to majors
There seems to be some misun
derstanding about the meaning of the
"exit requirement" policy passed by
the Faculty Senate on April 3, so I
appreciate an opportunity to explain
this policy's rationale and signifi
cance.
This policy confirms and makes ex
plicit a longstanding principle of
Stanford undergraduate education:
free and equal access to the major of
one's choice. Unlike many other uni
versities. Stanford admits its under
graduates to the entire university,
without reference to prospective
major field, and then permits every
student to enter any major offered by
the University. In recent months, a
few departments that currently have
large numbers of majors asked Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
whether they could limit access to
their major through numerical quotas
or through high grade-point prere
quisites to major declaration or
through high grade-point require
ments for graduation. The first two
have long been prohibited by explicit
policy, but policy on the third had
never been stated. The exit require
ment passed last week by the Faculty
Senate enunciated this prohibition on
high grade-point requirements for
graduation so that departments could
not erect barriers that would limit un
dergraduates' free choice of major

field.
This new policy statement seems to
have been misinterpreted as a benefit
for one or another subset of the un
dergraduate population. It is, rather,
properly understood as a restatement
of the venerable principle of open
access to majors which is one of Stan
ford's distinctive, revered and care
fully preserved values.

Question schools
on animal rights
Universities all over the country,
including Stanford, have been ap
proached about their questionable
practices regarding experimenting on
live animals in the laboratories. Spe
cifically, they were asked to stop ac
quiring lost pets from the pound, to
agree to unscheduled visits by profes
sionals, to allow science students to
decline from experimenting on
animals and to begin a dialogue with
the animal rights community about
the care and treatment of the animals
they have possessed. The campuses
are stonewalling this issue, including
firing the head veterinarian at UC-
Berkeley for speaking out about gross
negligence over a period of years in
the care of lab animals at Cal. Part of
the researchers' propaganda cam
paign is to offer meaningless guided

"tours of a small section of the labs
which have been specially sanitized
for that purpose. It's very suspect,
since Stanford, Cal and others have
either been found guilty and fined or
have been sued for mistreatment of
animals, and they're doing it on
federal grants provided by taxpayers'
money. The universities are lying to
us and 1 for one will not rest until the
above very reasonable demands are
met.

Letter is off base
Rarely have I seen a more puerile,
inane and intolerant letter than the
one by Jim Corl and Bob Abbot
(Daily, April 21), in which they at
tack the shantytown and graveyard
put up by Stanford Out of South
Africa and the sanctuary movement
in White Plaza. It is not their right
wing views I find most objectionable.
It is their lack of even minimal logic,
rationality or respect for the rights of
others.
They ask: "If [SOSA and the sanc
tuary movement] want to remind us
of suffering, is it not also our right...
to see it removed?" No, I don't think
so, guys. That's called freedom of ex
pression. If you don't like the views
they're expressing, go out and express
your own. You most certainly don't

have the "right" to suppress other
people's views just because they of
fend you.
As for calling the shanty a "fire
hazard" because some sick arsonist
torched it, if this isn't a case of
"blaming the victim," I've never seen
one. Under Corl and Abbot's logic,
attacks on an unpopular speaker are a
justification for suppressing the
speaker as a "public danger." God
help us if this fascist doctrine ever
takes hold in what I had thought was
the "land of the free."
Finally, I fail to grasp the logic of
accusing SOSA activists of
"hypocrisy," simply because they
don't go to the extreme of sacrificing
their entire academic careers in
working for their cause. What is this,
some kind of arbitrary "all-or
nothing" rule of political commit
ment? As for why SOSA members
don't "divest themselves from Stan
ford," as Corl and Abbot snidely sug
gest, maybe it's because they like
Stanford, and want to make it a bet
ter, more humane place. You know,
"reform-from-within," "work
within-the-system"? Isn't that the ar
gument (perfectly legitimate) used by
those opposed to divestment from
South Africa?
Read up on the Bill of Rights, guys.
You might learn something. And take
a course in elementary logical reason
ing while you're at it.

dergraduates' free choice of major

field.
This new policy statement seems to
have been misinterpreted as a benefit
for one or another subset of the un
dergraduate population. It is, rather,
properly understood as a restatement
of the venerable principle of open
access to majors which is one of Stan
ford's distinctive, revered and care
fully preserved values.

Question schools
on animal rights
Universities all over the country,
including Stanford, have been ap
proached about their questionable
practices regarding experimenting on
live animals in the laboratories. Spe
cifically, they were asked to stop ac
quiring lost pets from the pound, to
agree to unscheduled visits by profes
sionals, to allow science students to
decline from experimenting on
animals and to begin a dialogue with
the animal rights community about
the care and treatment of the animals
they have possessed. The campuses
are stonewalling this issue, including
firing the head veterinarian at UC-
Berkeley for speaking out about gross
negligence over a period of years in
the care of lab animals at Cal. Part of
the researchers' propaganda cam
paign is to offer meaningless guided

"tours of a small section of the labs
which have been specially sanitized
for that purpose. It's very suspect,
since Stanford, Cal and others have
either been found guilty and fined or
have been sued for mistreatment of
animals, and they're doing it on
federal grants provided by taxpayers'
money. The universities are lying to
us and 1 for one will not rest until the
above very reasonable demands are
met.

Letter is off base
Rarely have I seen a more puerile,
inane and intolerant letter than the
one by Jim Corl and Bob Abbot
(Daily, April 21), in which they at
tack the shantytown and graveyard
put up by Stanford Out of South
Africa and the sanctuary movement
in White Plaza. It is not their right
wing views I find most objectionable.
It is their lack of even minimal logic,
rationality or respect for the rights of
others.
They ask: "If [SOSA and the sanc
tuary movement] want to remind us
of suffering, is it not also our right...
to see it removed?" No, I don't think
so, guys. That's called freedom of ex
pression. If you don't like the views
they're expressing, go out and express
your own. You most certainly don't

have the "right" to suppress other
people's views just because they of
fend you.
As for calling the shanty a "fire
hazard" because some sick arsonist
torched it, if this isn't a case of
"blaming the victim," I've never seen
one. Under Corl and Abbot's logic,
attacks on an unpopular speaker are a
justification for suppressing the
speaker as a "public danger." God
help us if this fascist doctrine ever
takes hold in what I had thought was
the "land of the free."
Finally, I fail to grasp the logic of
accusing SOSA activists of
"hypocrisy," simply because they
don't go to the extreme of sacrificing
their entire academic careers in
working for their cause. What is this,
some kind of arbitrary "all-or
nothing" rule of political commit
ment? As for why SOSA members
don't "divest themselves from Stan
ford," as Corl and Abbot snidely sug
gest, maybe it's because they like
Stanford, and want to make it a bet
ter, more humane place. You know,
"reform-from-within," "work
within-the-system"? Isn't that the ar
gument (perfectly legitimate) used by
those opposed to divestment from
South Africa?
Read up on the Bill of Rights, guys.
You might learn something. And take
a course in elementary logical reason
ing while you're at it.

New rule insures
access to majors
There seems to be some misun
derstanding about the meaning of the
"exit requirement" policy passed by
the Faculty Senate on April 3, so I
appreciate an opportunity to explain
this policy's rationale and signifi
cance.
This policy confirms and makes ex
plicit a longstanding principle of
Stanford undergraduate education:
free and equal access to the major of
one's choice. Unlike many other uni
versities. Stanford admits its under
graduates to the entire university,
without reference to prospective
major field, and then permits every
student to enter any major offered by
the University. In recent months, a
few departments that currently have
large numbers of majors asked Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies
whether they could limit access to
their major through numerical quotas
or through high grade-point prere
quisites to major declaration or
through high grade-point require
ments for graduation. The first two
have long been prohibited by explicit
policy, but policy on the third had
never been stated. The exit require
ment passed last week by the Faculty
Senate enunciated this prohibition on
high grade-point requirements for
graduation so that departments could
not erect barriers that would limit un
dergraduates' free choice of major

field.
This new policy statement seems to
have been misinterpreted as a benefit
for one or another subset of the un
dergraduate population. It is, rather,
properly understood as a restatement
of the venerable principle of open
access to majors which is one of Stan
ford's distinctive, revered and care
fully preserved values.
