# Rush fosters conformity
## 
### 
I have these black leather loafers that I wear rather of
ten. Not many people like them. I admit that they are
rather beat-up looking; however, they are comfortable
and durable. I remember when I first started wearing this
type of shoe — it was in junior high school.
I was a new student and was desperately trying to find
friends in a system with well-established cliques. I ac
quainted myself with one particular group of girls and at
tempted to quietly assume a position within it. It was ex
tremely important to me at the time; I recall my naive
eagerness to join this group whose popularity would cer
tainly earn me some recognition in this new school. Then
came the shoes.
I loved them. I thought that they were the most unique
pair of loafers I had ever seen. Granted, the style of the
shoes was the simplest and most unpretentious 1 had ever
seen. Therein lay the attraction. I was absolutely certain
that no one else in the school had shoes like these. I re
member impatiently carrying them home from the shoe
store and excitedly arranging an outfit with which to wear
my new shoes for the next school day.

I remember confidently strolling into the first period
classroom; I proudly displayed my new acquisitions and
hoped that every girl (not to mention every boy) might
notice this drastic alteration in my attire. I'll admit I was a
bit stunned and hurt to discover that by the end of the
school day, not one person had commented on my new
shoes; but that did not deter me from donning the shoes
the following day, and the day after that. Finally, after a
few days of intolerable unrecognition, my shoes elicited a
comment from one of the girls for whom I had unfath
omable admiration.
"Oh, are those shoes new?" (By then, I had worn them
for two weeks.)
"Yeah, don't you love them?"
"Well, don't you think they're kind of . . . well, you
know .. . uh .. . ugly?"
I was crushed.
From that point on, I refused to wear the ugly black
leather shoes which had once held so much appeal for me.
I pleaded with my mother to buy me the shoes that every
one else was wearing, but she wouldn't because she
thought that high heels were a bit too sophisticated for
someone of my age. I wanted all the "in" clothes that they
wore; I wanted to have my hair cut in the same style in
which their hair was cut; I even complained when my
sandwich bags weren't the same as theirs. To make a long
story short, I never got their shoes; I never had my hair
cut; and I never got their type of sandwich bags. Eventu
ally, I returned to the shoes and sought friends elsewhere.
The point of the story might seem uninspiringly evi
dent; however, the scene of the tactless girl pointing cold
heartedly at my sorry-looking shoes comes to mind when I
reflect on the Rush activities of the past week.
Our generation was raised on the principle that in
dividualism and uniqueness reveal appealing distinction;

Oil the other hand, conformity and uniformity display a
blatant lack of self-definition and initiative. Raised by
liberal-thinking parents during the radical 1960s and '70s,
we were brought up to believe that superficial distinctions
are intrinsically meaningless; regardless of race or color,
human beings are human beings and all deserve to be
treated as such. And yet, there exists within each one of us
the conflict between boldly asserting individualism and
desperately wanting to achieve that secure feeling that we
"belong."
When I came to Stanford, I was immediately struck by
the impressive diversity of the student body. Even in the
most superficial consideration, everyone looked different.
Each individual projected a unique personality, one with
different interests and variegated tastes.
It could be due to a more acute awareness of reality, but
it now seems to me that everyone looks the same. Is it my
imagination, or is every girl on campus wearing multi
colored pants?
The entire activity of Rush fosters this loss of in
dividualism. The cursory introductions, the stock ques
tions, the incessant smiles and "Hi, how are you's," the
"proper" dressing for a few precious nights of being on
stage, and the final decisions based on these superficial
considerations — all these aid the destruction of the indi
vidual personalities which supposedly characterize each
one of us. The Rush system sifts out those who do not
epitomize its one specific definition of a desirable individ
ual. At this point, it would be specious and presumptuous
to refer to it as an "individual"; perhaps "prototype"
would be a more accurate definition.
It seems clear that the desire to belong, to fit in some
where, more than occasionally overpowers our desire to
project a certain individuality (a word which, at least in
the past, has been synonomous with the word
"uniqueness").
The uniqueness of the shoes in seventh grade would
have made me unique, a quality I respected and admired
— a quality, I thought, others respected and admired as
well. Fortunately, my memorable encounter with the con
flict between individuality and feeling accepted was not
particularly earth-shattering. Seventh-graders tend to
possess an emotional resilience. If anything, I understood
fairly early that the conflict would only become painful at
the moments during which the individual realizes he (or
she) has sacrificed his (or her) individuality to the
sometimes superficial security of the sense of belonging. In
all fairness, I had to also acknowledge the reverse: it could
be equally painful to realize that one has sacrificed all
sense of belonging by pursuing the peculiar interest of
one's personality. To me, however, the realization that I
have in some way compromised my individuality is more
painful and deprecating than the realization that I may
have alienated myself a bit from others.
My first encounter with the conflict between asserting
one's individuality and feeling welcomed in society was
certainly not to be my last, although it is the most
memorable. Like I said though — a seventh graders emo
tional state is rather stable.
Those students who rushed and were rejected by the
fraternities or sororities they had tried to join will have to
accept not only the knowledge that they failed to achieve
the desired sense of belonging, but that they also unjustly,
albeit momentarily, compromised their individuality.
