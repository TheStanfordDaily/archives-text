## How doth thou bug me, or not? 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
The sun was shining brightly down from the
beautiful blue skies. A smile as wide as the
heavens spread across the boy's face as he skipped
happily into The Daily office, looking mildly
foolish to passersby but happy nonetheless. He
was in such a wonderful mood that he decided to
do a belly slide across the slick linoleum office
floor to get to his mailbox.
When he got there it was empty. The sparkle
deserted his eyes and his heart crashed to the floor
with an audible thud (causing much perturbation
among the intense reporters huddled solemnly
over their telephones.) The boy stuck his hand into
the box to make sure that this nightmare was true.
As he stared into the empty cubicle, he began to
cry, and then he collapsed on the floor in a fit of
despair.
Once again, nobody had sent him any Bug Me
questions.
Only you can help prevent this tragedy from
happening again. Send your questions to Bug
Me, The Stanford Daily, Storke Student Publica
tions Building, Stanford, Calif. 94305.
And for those of you who keep asking me
questions whenever you see me anywhere, you
had better write them down if you want to make
sure they get answered. I have the relative
memory of a pool ball, so unless it's a really great
question, I'll no doubt forget it if you don't send
me a written copy. I'm serious.
Dear Bug Me,
Is it true that if your roommate commits suicide
you automatically get straight A's for that quarter?
-Burger King
This is a sensitive issue, and certainly not
something to be joked about. However, if you
think about it for a minute, there's just no way
around the fact that this myth, which seems to be
widely believed, is one of the most ludicrous and
farfetched fairy tales ever to make the rounds at
Stanford.
Seriously, just think about it for a second.
Sure, there are a lot of things the University
would do for you if your roommate committed
suicide: give you counseling help, let you stop
out, maybe freeze your grades as they stand at
that point in the quarter. But straight A's? That
could be really dangerous. People like me with
woeful grades might get desperate and try to
bump off our roommates.
Of course, for a while, I believed this myself.
Then I talked to Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Cadena, and he assured me that there is ab
solutely no basis for his myth.
"That's ridiculous," Cadena said.
Dear Bug Me,
Why are Marguerite buses so named?
-Ronald McDonald
This is one of those questions that has a lot of
apocryphal stories attached to it. I got several dif
ferent answers before finally receiving au
thoritative help from Robin Chandler of the Uni
versity Archives staff.

According to Chandler, there used to be a car
riage that shuttled passsengers between Palo
Alto and Stanford. From around the time the
University was founded until he died in 1911, a
man named Asa A. Andrews, affectionally
known as "Uncle John" (a big Grateful Dead
fan), drove the carriages.
The horse that pulled Andrews' carriage was
named Marguerite. Ever since then, campus
shuttle services have gone by that name, in
memory of Andrews and his horse.
Dear Bug Me,
For the last two years I have been struggling to
fill in my social calendar with Stanford sporting
distractions (both club and varsity). It seems that
the only newspaper in town that has the insight to
publish a weekly Stanford sports calendar (when it
feels like it), is not the one I am writing this letter
to. Is there any way that a small section of The
Daily could be devoted to containing such a
weekly schedule?
-Jacques Le Strappe
I consulted two high-ranking members of The
Daily sports staff, and they gave me several
reasons why such a weekly sports schedule isn't
printed now and why it would be impractical in
the future.
First of all, they told me, The Daily prints day
of-game previews for all varsity sports events, lis
ting time and place. Secondly, they told me
something to the effect that club sports aren't the
most rabidly-pursued spectator events on
campus, so a listing of those games might be
slightly less than worthwhile (though that sounds
like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me).

Furthermore, they went on, the most logical
day for such a listing would be Monday, which
also happens to be the most crowded day on the
sports page because of the plethora of games on
weekends. So, there really isn't room for a
schedule on the most sensible day.
If none of that's very satisfying, you can always
get comprehensive schedules for every team and
season from the Sports Information Office at En
cina Gym. Tell them the Bug sent you (that really
opens doors.)
Dear Bug Me,
Are there any harmful effects on a gold necklace
from wearing it in the chlorine-laced swimming
pool?
-Colonel Sanders
I had to test this one for myself, so last Sunday
morning, after a long Saturday night at the disco,
I just left my 12 gold chains on and went for a
little dip. Not only were the chains so heavy as to
make me sink immediately to the pool bottom,
but I also forgot to take my white bell-bottomed
polyester slacks off before jumping in, and that
was mighty uncomfortable. But the chains
emerged unscathed.
Then I talked to senior Chris Dickerson, a
long-time swimmer and currently a lifeguard at
DeGuerre Pool. She told, me that chlorine
doesn't damage good gold, but "cheap gold will
turn green, and then everybody will know." And
then you'll be really embarrassed.
We could probably go into the chemistry of
this, and discuss the properties of gold that resist
chemical reaction with chlorine, and so forth and
so on. But I don't think so.
