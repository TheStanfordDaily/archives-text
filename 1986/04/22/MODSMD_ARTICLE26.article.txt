## Willson musical boasts energy, high production values Ram's Head finds tour de force in 'Music Man' 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Like many popular Broadway mu
sical comedies, Meredith Willson's
"The Music Man" is a corny stroll
into America's past, with a plot that is
largely incidental to the songs and
dances which make up the bulk of the
show.
It's a simple enough play — a
quaint little love story set to the
rhythm of pre-war, small-town
Middle America.
Unlike many of those other musi
cals, however, "The Music Man," be
cause of Willson's irresistable charac
ters, clever lyrics and deep bag of mu
sical tricks, resists staleness. And
when it is performed with enthusiasm
and care, it becomes a rousing, heart
warming and hilarious slice of Ameri
can pie.
Ram's Head serves up just such a
tasty slice of Americana in its current
production of "The Music Man,"
which opened with three shows last
weekend at Memorial Auditorium
and finishes this week with 8 p.m.
shows on Friday and Saturday.
Willson's nostalgic journey is atypi
cal from the start. Rather than
opening with the customary singing
ensemble, the show begins with a
scene set on a railroad smoking car.
The train is traveling through lowa in
1912, and on board is a group of
traveling salesmen. It's a remarkable
scene, and the expert staging here
sets the tone for the rest of the show.
With the sounds of the moving
train as their only accompaniment,
the salesmen debate the virtues of
credit and other occupational prob
lems. As the train picks up speed, so
does the tempo of the conversation,
which is broken periodically by
repeated rhythmic phrases that serve
as a refrain. Eventually the men turn
to the subject of one of their less
than-honest fellow salesmen (and the
show's protagonist), one Harold Hill,
whose latest "line" is selling band in
struments and uniforms under the
guise of being a music teacher.
The conversation slows and chugs
to a halt along with the train, and fur
ther discussion reveals that Hill's ploy
is to take the money and run before
anyone realizes that his credentials
are bogus. As the scene closes, the
salesmen defy Hill to try his hand
with the conservative residents of
lowa.
Sure enough (surprise),
"Professor" Hill (played by Dave T.
Oehler) pops up in River City, lowa,
a sleepy, reactionary town where big
news is the arrival of a pool table in
the local billiard parlor.

To sell his band, Hill must convince
the citizens of River City that they
face a social crisis. He does this in
"Trouble," warning of the dangers of
pool ("That game with the 15 num
bered balls is the devil's tool"). Oeh
ler fills the stage in this number, en
dowing Hill with the fervor of a
revivalist preacher and the quick
talking cunning of a used-car
saleman. A charlatan in seersucker,
Hill mesmerizes the townspeople,
and they join with him, chanting
"Trouble!" behind his patter.
One who isn't mesmerized, though,
is the town's librarian and piano
teacher, Marian Paroo (played by
Stephanie Manuel), who, by coinci
dence, is both unmarried and quite
attractive. Hill, sensing the threat
posed to his entire scheme by this
genuine music teacher, wastes little
time before putting the move on, only
to be rebuffed by the stolid and vir
tuous Marian.
In "Piano Lesson," Marian and her
mother (played with a wonderful
Irish brogue by Carol Murray) discuss
Marian's spinsterism. Here Willson
uses another neat musical gimmick,
setting the discussion to a simple scale
played by Amaryllis (Rebecca Ap
tekar), one of Marian's piano stu
dents. It's a charming number, and
segues nicely into "Goodnight My
Someone," a beautiful ballad, again
set to the tune of a simple piano exer
cise, in which Manuel reveals a voice
as bright and clear as the stars to
which Marian sings.
In the meantime, Hill sets to work
on the rest of the town, with Oehler
shining throughout these scenes. In
"76 Trombones," Hill interrupts the
town's fourth of July assembly to extol
the virtues of a boy's band as the an
swer to the town's "trouble." As
Marian looks on in dismay, the
townspeople are again caught up by
Hill, joining in the flag-waving, high
stepping anthem.
River City's terminally uptight
mayor (played by Hank Hoist) smells
a skunk. "That man is a spellbinder,"
he proclaims, and sends the River
City schoolboard to get Hill's creden
tials.
In quick succession, Hill manages
to transform the bickering, predatory
schoolboard into a blissfully har
monious barbershop quartet, and
then turns their wives into an inept
but enthusiastic dance company. The
two groups come together in a scene
which begins with "Pick-a-Little,
Talk-a-Little," a delightful patter
song in which the gossipy women
reveal Marian's supposedly sordid
past to Hill. The quartet adds
"Goodnight Ladies" in counter

melody, and the effect is wonderful.
Marian, though, is still an obstacle,
and Hill gives her the hard sell in the
next scene. Set in River City's library,
this scene is the creative highlight of
the first act. The set is breathtaking,
with bookshelves rising in Gothic
magnificence behind the stern-faced
Marian. Oehler comes into full voice

with "Marian the Librarian," which
begins as a crooning dirge before
quickening and growing into a full
scale dance sequence. The choreog
raphy is excellent, as Hill orchestrates
the onset of chaos in Marian's sanctu
ary. The children abandon their
books and break into dance, and
there are interludes of pas de deux
(nicely performed by Kristin Strout

and Tony Chamblee) and square
dancing. Manuel plays Marian per
fectly, beginning the scene with
venomous outrage before finally suc
cumbing and joining hopelessly in the
dancing.
If Marian shows herself a little
human in the library scene, she shows
even more warmth under the ice two

scenes later. Manuel's voice again
soars with "White Knight," Marian's
hymn to her ideal man.
In the final scene of the first act,
the .townspeople joyfully anticipate
the arrival of the "Wells Fargo
Wagon" (and you thought it was just
a bank). Marian's little brother
Winthrop (Kevin Silberman), or
dinarily painfully withdrawn and

close-lipped because of a lisp, breaks
into solo song in expectation that the
wagon may be carrying his band in
strument. Marian, realizing that her
brother's conversion (and most of the
town's excitement) is attributable to
Hill's influence, seems to be won over
as the act closes.
To encourage readers to go see the
show for themselves, this review
won't deal with the second act in
detail. Suffice it to say that the show's
second half is just as splendid as the
first, with the exception of a couple
scenes that could do with a little
quicker pacing.
Three second act numbers,
however, do deserve special mention.
One is the opening gymnasium scene:
the mayor's wife (Sandra Elizabeth
Ford) leads the dance company in
some ludicrous ballet accompanied
by the quartet singing "It's You,"
then the big "Shipoopi" dance num
ber, led by Hill's pal Marcellus
(Stephen Randall), is performed with
roof-raising energy and fun choreog
raphy.
Later in the act, the quartet scores
again with "Lida Rose," gracefully
overlapped by Marian's sweet "Will I
Ever Tell You."
Finally, on " 'Til There Was You"
(the pre-Beatles version), Manuel's
voice is again gorgeous, raising the
hair on the back of at least one
reviewer's neck.
Manuel's vocal performance is cer
tainly a highlight of the show, but
she's not alone on a cast that is uni
formly excellent. From"the kids in
the knickerbockers" (a delightful
kiddie corps gleaned from Palo Alto
grade schools) to the town elders,
every role is played with skill and just
the right combination of sincerity and
tongue-in-cheek self-mockery neces
sary to make the script's built-in corn
palatable (and, usually, quite enter
taining).
Three performances are particu
larly irresistible:
As Winthrop, Kevin Silberman, all
toothy grin and jutting elbows and
knees, is plucky and — okay, I'll
come right out and say it — adorable.
Michael Collins brings anvil sales
man Charlie Cowell (quite a
mundane character in most produc
tions of "The Music Man") to life as a
hilariously outrageous boor, shred
ding every scene he steps into.
The quartet (played by Tim
Cochran, Barton W. Conroy, Randy
Hart and Martin Puryear) also
deserves special mention. With won
derful singing and a deft comedic
touch, the group lights up every scene
it appears in.
In the end, this show, like any pro

duction of "The Music Man," belongs
to Hill and Marian. Oehler and
Manuel never disappoint. With
kinetic hucksterism on one side and
golden-voiced loveliness on the
other, they stand as twin towers at the
center of the show.
Oehler's acting is tremendous, and
though his voice lacks strength at
times, his flawless intonation and
charismatic style more than make up
for any shortcomings. Even theater
goers who have seen many produc
tions of "The Music Man" will find
remarkable freshness and electricity
in Oehler's rendering of Hill.
Manuel is completely convincing
throughout the show, adeptly tread
ing the fine line between iciness and
allure that runs through the middle of
Marian's character. Her voice is al
ways strong and crystal-clear.
The virtues of this show go well
beyond its strong cast, however. The
production maintains its buoyancy by
avoiding the undertow of three of the
most chronic problems of student
musicals: shabby orchestral playing,
poor ensemble singing and low pro
duction values.
Here, the orchestra, under the di
rection of John Lazor, is well
rehearsed, unobtrusive behind the
singers and appropriately brassy and
pompous in exposed parts. The en
semble singing is equally well-done:
strong, in tune, and energetic.
As for production values, the entire
show, with few exceptions, is
mounted with professionalism and
care. The sets range from utilitarian
(downtown River City) to lavish (the
library and railroad car), but all are
completely effective, and tricky scene
changes are handled with aplomb.
The period costuming is also impec
cable.
On several occasions, staging and
lighting combine to great effect, par
ticularly in the case of an eye
catching black-on-red silhouette
tableau at the opening of the first
gymnasium scene.
Some followers of Ram's Head will
undoubtedly view a production of
"The Music Man" as artistic regres
sion after last spring's stark, hard
edged "Sweeney Todd." But the cast
of that show was dominated by
alumni and other persons from
outside the Stanford community. It's
reassuring to see the spring show
return to the hands of Stanford stu
dents, and they have come through
with a sparkling show.
A tip of the straw hat to cast and
crew, and especially to director Amy
Zeh and producer Emily Breuner.
They make this trip to River City
magical and well worth taking.
