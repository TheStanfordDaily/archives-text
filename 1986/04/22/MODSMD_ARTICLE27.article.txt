## East/West gags die in 'Gung Ho'

"Gung Ho" aspires to some classic
American satirical roots. Remember
Mark Twain's "The Man Who Cor
rupted Hadleyburg"? Ron Howard's
latest film pays homage to Twain
both in spirit and in town name: the
movie is set in Hadleyville, Pa., where
a closed-down car factory has sent the
community into an emotional and fi
nancial slump. There's one hope:
young management liaison Hunt
Stevenson (Michael Keaton) is off
to Japan to sell Assan Motors on
Hadleyville as the location for their
new auto plant.
Stevenson is not one to rise to the
occasion; his feet may be in the
middle of a rice paddy field, but his
slobby sense of humor is stuck in
Smallsville, U.S.A. He swings into ac
tion with the Assan representatives,
employing a slangy hustler's idiom and
a smug style that appears to fall flat
with the deadpan Japanese execs.
Surprise, surprise. Hadleyville gets
its auto plant, and we get a satiric set
up that's ripe with possibilities.
The possibilities don't all pan out,
but it may be that Howard and
screenwriters Edwin Blum, Lowell
Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (the gang
from "Splash!") just lack the ruth
lessness for Twainian satire. I can
envision a team like Robert Zemeckis
and Bob Gale ("Used Cars," "Back
to the Future") on this project —
they have an energetic heartlessness
to match Twain's sensibility.
But Howard and company pull
back from any sour endings or any
really nasty jibes. "Gung Ho" turns
out to be a lot like the cars the Assan
plant produces: reliable, well-crafted,
but uninspired.
Once the Assan plant and
managerial staff move in, the movie
becomes, in part, an East-meets-
West clash of caricatures. The upright
Japanese team requires morning
calisthenics and eschews music in the
workplace (the filmmakers still
manage to squeeze in a couple of mis
begotten assembly-line rock videos,
though; they play like car company
commercials). The likably uncouth,
provincial Americans feel put out by

Assan's demands for greater effi
ciency, and joke about things like the
communal Japanese river baths.
Howard and company underscore
the very real hostilities that underlie
these jokes, and also point up the un
reasonableness of many of the

Japanese demands. The filmmakers
spend much time — too much time —
balancing the books between the two
camps; for satirists, they're sure fair
minded.
Still, they conjure up some funny
moments, the best of which include
Keaton and Gedde Watanabe as
Kazahiro, the Assan plant manager
who's just made it through the

"punishment school" for bad execu
tives back home. Watanabe steals
scenes from Keaton, and Keaton has
the good sense to let him.
Kazahiro is a man supremely aware
of his precarious position at the head
of a business he doesn't care for; in

the film's craziest moments (including
one gem at a bowling alley bar), this
knowledge unhinges him. In quieter
scenes, Watanabe underplays nicely
— and creates a genuinely human,
touching character.
At the center of this movie is
Keaton, who is fast developing a
reputation as a safe, reliable Bill
Murray type (but does anyone wont a

safe, reliable Bill Murray?). Keaton
has some of Murray's unpredictability
and insincerity, but he isn't as sub
versive. Murray is always outside of
his movies, commenting on the action
from a distance, and that can be sub
versive when the material is rotten.
But Keaton is much more a part of his
movies, and he can't rise above his
material in the same way.
Keaton was forgettable in the
eminently forgettable "Mr. Mom,"
and likable in the likable "Night
Shift." At his best, Keaton is adept at
a kind of frenetic, harried physical
comedy; he's always doing some
thing, even when the movies he's in
are dragging along.
In "Gung Ho," he finds the best
role he's ever had. Hunt Stevenson
spends most of his time telling himself
and everyone else that he has things
under control, but there's a wild-eyed
self-awareness behind this pose. He's
continually outsmarting himself, and
he gets more desperately phony as
scheme after scheme backfires.
In his handling of Keaton and
Watanabe, Howard continues to
demonstrate his skill with comic
performers. He's adept at bringing
out the strengths of his actors, and
these become the strengths of his
films.
The talents of Keaton and
Watanabe aren't enough to carry the
full length of "Gung Ho," however.
When the writers run out of fresh
ideas in the last half hour or so, the
movie gets obvious and tiresome. As
a director. Howard doesn't have the
flair to transform his material; he
serves it with a great deal of com
petence. and that makes him a safe,
respectable craftsman, perfect for
projects like "Splash!" and
"Cocoon."
But Howard's lack of a distinctive
style is glaringly apparent in "Gung
Ho." which is entertaining enough
while you're watching it — at least
until the forced and ineptly staged
"happy" ending — but doesn't stay
with you very long. It's one of those
movies that occupies a little blank
spot in your memory. If you ask
friends whether they want to go see it,
they're likely to ask, "Have we seen
that one yet?"
