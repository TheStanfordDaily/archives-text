# 'Turtle' drowns in crocodile tears
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Listening to the audience at "Turtle Diary" was often more revealing
than listening to the characters 1 dialogue. The audience I saw it with was
clearly "educated," which means that most people laughed at everything
the epigrammatic characters had to say. "Turtle Diary" is a slight com
edy about repression and reaching out, and with writer Harold Pinter
(adapting Russell Hoban's novel) this theme translates into characters
spouting terse little utterances with pinched expressions on their faces.
With "Turtle Diary," there isn't that much going on to understand.
Nevertheless, lest we miss anything, Pinter and director John Irvin
spread their characters and themes out on a table and dissect them with
enervating precision and care.
"Turtle Diary" is long on a kind of petrified British charm, and it un
folds at a very leisurely — bordering on torpid — pace. The story con
cerns two people: Naera Duncan (Glenda Jackson) is a writer of
children's books and William Snow (Ben Kingsley) is a bookstore clerk
(both Pinter and Hoban like to match their characters by occupation —
the jobs here are both "quaint").
They frequent the sea turtle exhibit at the London Zoo and stare for
lornly into the tank, reflecting on the empty, emotionally barren lives
they lead. They go home to their tidy little flats, where they are assaulted
by garrulous or slovenly or neurotic neighbors who possess names like
Flora Neep.
They independently come up with the idea of releasing the zoo turtles
into the sea, and, enlisting the aid of the turtle keeper (Michael Gam
bon), one day rent a van, load the turtles up and drive them to the
Devonshire coast. This is the biggest adventure of their lives, and it
represents an emotional "coming out" for both of them.
Pinter is much kinder to his characters here than he was in his last
screenplay, "Betrayal." Naera and William are rather pathetic, but at
least there's some spark of humanity in them, and their drive together is
genuinely charming and even emotionally engaging. They quote "Moby
Dick" to each other, and adapt it to their own situation; when they set
the turtles free, it's surprisingly exhilarating, and it's also the high point
of the movie.
Unfortunately, "Turtle Diary" doesn't end there, and we have to fol
low Naera and William back to London to see precisely how their jour
ney has changed their lives. These scenes of their rebirth are moderately
enjoyable, but are also repetitive and redundant after the climax, and
the movie begins to seem too long.
Jackson's Naera looks unrelievedly morose, on the verge of tears, as if
it were downright painful for her to smile (the few times she does seem
happy appear to confirm this suspicion). Kingsley gets much mileage out
of his enigmatic little smile and a wary spaciness; his character is mar
ginally more interesting than Jackson's, but it's really like comparing
species of snails — there are differences, but you're still stuck with snails.
At one point, right at the beginning, I imagined that these two
performers were chosen for their remarkable resemblance to the sea
turtles themselves. A couple of times the director appeared to cut from
turtle face to actor face in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to con
nect the two; this is not a flattering statement on the actors' expressive
ness or range. "Turtle Diary" is moderately successful within its self
imposed limits, but those limits are terribly confining, and you might
reasonably expect more for two hours of your time and $5 of your
money.
