After a disappointing series loss last weekend to Arizona State, Stan
ford trailed UCLA by one game in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division. But 24 hours later, the Cardinal was on top of the Six-Pat
after sweeping a douhleheader from the Bruins yesterday at Sunken
Diamond. Stanford now has a 14-7 league mark, while UCLA and
Arizona are a game back at 13-8. Counterclockwise from bottom left:
After his fourth-inning triple in game two put Stanford ahead 4-3, Ken
Green tacked another run onto the Cardinal's when he scored on Frank
Carey's sacrifice fly. It was one of two tallies for Green in the game.
Mark Davis was held hitless for the day, but he reached base four times
and patrolled centerfield with his usual ease. Lee Plemel turned in an
iron man performance, pitching 7-1/3 innings to win the first game.
Plemel had pitched 8-2/3 frames Friday against Arizona State.
