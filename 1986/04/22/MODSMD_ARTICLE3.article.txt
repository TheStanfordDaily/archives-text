# Farm to raise funds for AIDS
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
Top administrators, faculty and students
here are organizing a fund-raising benefit
for AIDS education and research May 10, to
be kicked off with a garden party reception
at the home of University President Donald
Kennedy.
The two-hour reception at the Lou Henry
Hoover house will be followed by a special
performance of "Unfinished Business," a
play about AIDS presented by the Theater
Rhinocerwrof.^n-Ftsmfcttco.
Organizers believe the benefit, entitled
"Stanford Cares," is one of the first efforts
of its kind at a major university. They hope
it will raise awareness of the disease and its
impact on the nation's college and university
campuses.
"AIDS disproportionately strikes people
of college and graduate school age," said
Michael Smith, a second-year MBA student
at the Graduate School of Business and
chairman of the AIDS Benefit Organizing
Committee. "It's a common problem, not
just for a minority of students. We want
everyone in the University to see that
there's something they can do and that it can
affect them."

A graduate student originally enrolled in
the business school died of AIDS, or ac
quired immune deficiency syndrome, last
Christmas. The student, a friend of Smith's
and many others, never completed his
degree here. Many of his classmates, and
others who have lost friends to the disease,
have volunteered to help with the benefit.
"1 lost a very good friend," Smith said. "I
felt kind of useless at first. I felt I needed to
do something bigger, to reach out to the
Stanford community or even larger."
Kennedy will speak briefly at the recep
tion. "AIDS threatens all of us — if only by
claiming the lives of people we respect and
care for, " he said in a statement to the Uni
versity News Service. "I urge all members of
the University and local communities to
support the Stanford Cares benefit.
"As an educational and research institu
tion, Stanford can play a vital role in com
batting this devastating disease. This event
provides an opportunity to acknowledge the
special efforts by members of our commu
nity engaged in AIDS research, treatment
and education," Kennedy said.
Deaths related to AIDS are rising
astronomically. By the early 19905, experts
predict that 80,000 people will die of the
disease. Smith said.

"More than one year ago, I didn't know
anyone with an AIDS diagnosis," said Jeff
Zimman, a JD/MB A student here and mem
ber of the organizing committee. "Since
than I've lost a friend and (now) know a
couple of other people who have ARC
(AIDS-related condition) diagnoses."
Beneficiaries will include the Stanford
Medical Center, which is to support AIDS
researcn, the ARIS Project to support
services to people with AIDS in Santa Clara
County and the San Francisco AIDS Foun
dation to support its AIDS education ef-

forts.
Smith hopes to raise $20,000 from the
benefit and said the committee hopes to
cover costs of the event through corporate
donations so that student donations will go
directly to AIDS support. The $25 donation
for students "is less than students would
spend going to the city for a night on the
town, dinner and theater. And that's what
we are providing here," Smith said.
The program is co-sponsored by the Stan
ford AIDS Benefit Organizing Committee
and the Stanford AIDS Education Project.
The organizing committee comprises 45 stu
dents, faculty and staff members at Stan
ford. The AIDS Education Project is a stu
dent group that has sponsored numerous
educational efforts on campus this year.
