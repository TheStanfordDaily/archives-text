## Stanford sweeps back into Six-Pac lead Clutch pitching by Kunkel, Plemel and Osuna lead Cardinal to 5-2, 6-5 victories 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Watchers of Stanford baseball will tell you that things
arighted themselves yesterday.
After Sunday s 7-6 loss to Arizona State here, the
Cardinal fell out of the top spot in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's Southern Division for the first time all year.
The Cardinal, the three-time defending Six-Pac cham
pion, didn t stay in those unfamiliar environs very long.
Stanford, now 14-7 in league, stormed back to sweep a
doubleheader from UCLA at Sunken Diamond yesterday
to retake the Six-Pac. lead. The Bruins, 13-8, trail Stan
ford by a game.
"They can't get much bigger than this," Coach Mark
Marquess said after his team completed the sweep with a
6-5 second-game win. "My guys came out today with fire
in their eyes ... we knew in the warmups that they would
be ready to play."
The Cardinal won the first game 5-2 behind the
complete-game effort of right-handed starter Kevin
Kunkel.
"Our feeling coming in was we had to be really aggres
sive, to try to put as much pressure on them as we could,"
Marquess said. "Today we forced the issue."
Marquess' team applied pressure in two ways. The first,
the more conventional of the pair, shows up in the box
score. Stanford stole six bases against UCLA's freshman
catcher, Bill Haselman, in the two games.
The other isn't as quantifiable — but was just as
meaningful. The Cardinal bench did some mighty aggres
sive jockeying yesterday, visibly rattling some UCLA
players.
So loud was the Stanford dugout that it drew a warning
from home-plate umpire Bob Alvarado in the first game.
"Put it this way," Marquess said, "there's no love lost be
tween the two teams. . . . Anyway, I don't want a church
atmosphere; my guys aren't going to just sit on their
hands."
In yesterday's second game, UCLA took a 1-0 lead
with a run in the top of the first. Steve Stowell led off with
a line-drive single to right off Lee Plemel, Stanford's
starter who was pitching with only two days rest after
going eight innings Friday. An out later, he moved to third
when Plemel skipped a throw past Ron Witmeyer at first.
Tory Lovullo, UCLA's shortstop, drove Stowell in with
a bounce out to second base.
Stanford came right back with a pair of runs in the bot
tom of the inning. Dana Ridenour threw all of 13 pitches,
12 of which were balls, and loaded the bases with three
free passes before Bruin Coach Gary Adams sent for Bill
Wenrick out of his bullpen.
Toi Cook hit into a run-scoring force play to tie the
score at 1-1. Witmeyer then lined a single to right-field to
score John Ramos with Stanford's go-ahead tally.
The teams traded runs in the second. Steve Hisey sin
gled to center for UCLA, moved to second on Hasel man's
chopper over Ruben Amaro's head at third and scored on
second baseman Gary Berman's single to center.
The Cardinal came back with a run in the bottom of the
second to make the score 3-2. With two out, shortstop
Frank Carey (4-for-5 in the two games) yanked a Wenrick
offering to right field. Tim Osborne got a glove on the ball
but couldn't hold on as he hit the ground. Carey wound up
at third with a triple.


Kevin Kunkel's Stanford career has not exactly been all fun and games, but after
yesterday's 5-2 win over UCLA, a little frivolity with Walt Harris (right) and
Mark Davis was definitely in order. The senior right-hander tossed a complete-

game eight-hitter to give the Cardinal a victory in the first game of a
doubleheader, which Stanford ultimately swept by taking the second game 6-5.
Stanford now leads the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division by one game.
Carey came across when Berman
booted Amaro's groundball.
Haselman hit a solo home run over
the score board in left-center field off
Plemel in the top of the fourth to tie
the game once again.
Stanford roughed up Wenrick for
two more runs in its half of the fourth.
Ken Green tripled to the wall in left
center to score Ed Sprague, who had
singled. The next batter, Carey,
lofted a sacrifice fly to shallow center
field.
Ramos drove in Stanford's sixth
run with a line-drive single to right in
the seventh that scored Green from
second.
In the top of the eighth, Plemel —
who Marquess said "came up with an
unbelievable effort" —weakened.
With Lovullo on first after walking,
first baseman John Joslyn pulled
Plemel's one-strike pitch over the
right-field fence to pull UCLA to
within one run of Stanford. It was his
13th home run of the year.

Joslyn s blow also signaled the end
for Plemel. Marquess went with Brian
Keyser, but after the freshman
walked the next batter, Hisey, on four
pitches and then threw a ball to
Haselman, Marquess sent for his
stopper out of the bullpen, Al Osuna.
Osuna came in to get Haselman to
ground into an inning-ending double
play, then struck out the side in the
ninth to preserve Stanford's win.
"He was excellent out there,"
Ramos said of Osuna, who earned his
second save. "He came right after the
hitters. He didn't try to fool them, he
just overpowered them."
"My slider came on today like a
charm," Osuna said. "It had good
break and good location."
In the first game yesterday, Stan
ford scored single runs in the first and
third to stake Kunkel to an early lead.
In the first, Cook grounded a base hit
up the middle to score Ramos who
had singled and stolen second. Cook
plated Amaro with a sacrifice fly to
right field in the third.

run home run to Haselman in the top
of the third, Stanford rallied for three
runs in the bottom of the inning. Walt
Harris walked, stole second, moved
to third on pitcher Jeff Conine's
throwing error and scored on Green
flyout to right.
Then with two out, Carey rolled a
single to center and Amaro walked.
Conine appeared to have escaped,
however, when Ramos lofted what
appeared to be a routine fly to center.

namely Steve Chitren, Pete Salmon

tween the two teams. . . . Anyway, I don't want a church
atmosphere; my guys aren't going to just sit on their
hands."
In yesterday's second game, UCLA took a 1-0 lead
with a run in the top of the first. Steve Stowell led off with
a line-drive single to right off Lee Plemel, Stanford's
starter who was pitching with only two days rest after
going eight innings Friday. An out later, he moved to third
when Plemel skipped a throw past Ron Witmeyer at first.
Tory Lovullo, UCLA's shortstop, drove Stowell in with
a bounce out to second base.
Stanford came right back with a pair of runs in the bot
tom of the inning. Dana Ridenour threw all of 13 pitches,
12 of which were balls, and loaded the bases with three
free passes before Bruin Coach Gary Adams sent for Bill
Wenrick out of his bullpen.
Toi Cook hit into a run-scoring force play to tie the
score at 1-1. Witmeyer then lined a single to right-field to
score John Ramos with Stanford's go-ahead tally.
The teams traded runs in the second. Steve Hisey sin
gled to center for UCLA, moved to second on Hasel man's
chopper over Ruben Amaro's head at third and scored on
second baseman Gary Berman's single to center.
The Cardinal came back with a run in the bottom of the
second to make the score 3-2. With two out, shortstop
Frank Carey (4-for-5 in the two games) yanked a Wenrick
offering to right field. Tim Osborne got a glove on the ball
but couldn't hold on as he hit the ground. Carey wound up
at third with a triple.


Kevin Kunkel's Stanford career has not exactly been all fun and games, but after
yesterday's 5-2 win over UCLA, a little frivolity with Walt Harris (right) and
Mark Davis was definitely in order. The senior right-hander tossed a complete-

doubleheader, which Stanford ultimately swept by taking the second game 6-5.
Stanford now leads the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division by one game.
Carey came across when Berman
booted Amaro's groundball.
Haselman hit a solo home run over
the score board in left-center field off
Plemel in the top of the fourth to tie
the game once again.
Stanford roughed up Wenrick for
two more runs in its half of the fourth.
Ken Green tripled to the wall in left
center to score Ed Sprague, who had
singled. The next batter, Carey,
lofted a sacrifice fly to shallow center
field.
Ramos drove in Stanford's sixth
run with a line-drive single to right in
the seventh that scored Green from
second.
In the top of the eighth, Plemel —
who Marquess said "came up with an
unbelievable effort" —weakened.
With Lovullo on first after walking,
first baseman John Joslyn pulled
Plemel's one-strike pitch over the
right-field fence to pull UCLA to
within one run of Stanford. It was his
13th home run of the year.

Joslyn s blow also signaled the end
for Plemel. Marquess went with Brian
Keyser, but after the freshman
walked the next batter, Hisey, on four
pitches and then threw a ball to
Haselman, Marquess sent for his
stopper out of the bullpen, Al Osuna.
Osuna came in to get Haselman to
ground into an inning-ending double
play, then struck out the side in the
ninth to preserve Stanford's win.
"He was excellent out there,"
Ramos said of Osuna, who earned his
second save. "He came right after the
hitters. He didn't try to fool them, he
just overpowered them."
"My slider came on today like a
charm," Osuna said. "It had good
break and good location."
In the first game yesterday, Stan
ford scored single runs in the first and

In the first, Cook grounded a base hit

After Sunday s 7-6 loss to Arizona State here, the
Cardinal fell out of the top spot in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's Southern Division for the first time all year.
The Cardinal, the three-time defending Six-Pac cham
pion, didn t stay in those unfamiliar environs very long.
Stanford, now 14-7 in league, stormed back to sweep a
doubleheader from UCLA at Sunken Diamond yesterday
to retake the Six-Pac. lead. The Bruins, 13-8, trail Stan
ford by a game.
"They can't get much bigger than this," Coach Mark
Marquess said after his team completed the sweep with a
6-5 second-game win. "My guys came out today with fire
in their eyes ... we knew in the warmups that they would
be ready to play."
The Cardinal won the first game 5-2 behind the
complete-game effort of right-handed starter Kevin
Kunkel.
"Our feeling coming in was we had to be really aggres
sive, to try to put as much pressure on them as we could,"
Marquess said. "Today we forced the issue."
Marquess' team applied pressure in two ways. The first,
the more conventional of the pair, shows up in the box
score. Stanford stole six bases against UCLA's freshman
catcher, Bill Haselman, in the two games.
The other isn't as quantifiable — but was just as
meaningful. The Cardinal bench did some mighty aggres
sive jockeying yesterday, visibly rattling some UCLA
players.
So loud was the Stanford dugout that it drew a warning
from home-plate umpire Bob Alvarado in the first game.
