# A 						large peak among the valleys for Kunkel
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Kevin Kunkel's career as a pitcher at Stanford has, in
many ways, resembled a towering fly ball hit to deep cen
ter field. You know, one of those drives that just might
have enough to clear the wall for a home run. Maybe.
It goes up, way up. And back, way back. For a moment,
there's anticipation — this one's got a chance.
And then, it comes down, way down. And, smack, right
into the mitt of a back-pedaling fielder on the warning
track. Sigh, just another long out.
Kunkel, who came to Stanford from Leonardo, N.J.,

four years ago as a top recruit, has at times fallen just
short of lofty expectations. And his travails have left more
than a few fans wondering, "What if?"
Yesterday, however, Kunkel may have finally found the
range. Or maybe he finally got some luck, something like
a tailwind that turns a popup into a round-tripper. These
days, Kunkel's hits are falling in.
His 5-2 complete-game win in the first game of yester
day's doubleheader with UCLA pulled Stanford into a tie
with the Bruins atop the standings in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division.
"The key for us today," Marquess said after his team
finished a sweep of the Bruins with a 6-5 second-game

win, "was Kunkel going nine innings. He really saved our
pitching staff."
"He had great stuff out there," catcher John Ramos
said of the senior right-hander who picked up his fourth
win in seven decisions this year. "He was coming right at
them, challenging them."
Kunkel survived a shaky first inning — in which he
allowed three UCLA singles but no runs — and Bill
Haselman's tape measure, two-run home run in the fourth
before settling down to hold the Bruins hitless through the
final 5-1/3 frames.
"1 was probably a little excited in the early in
nings ... 1 was getting the ball up," said Kunkel,
who walked four and struck out five on the after
noon. "Then I relaxed and found a good rhythm."
The going hasn't always been so smooth for
Kunkel, the only senior on Stanford's pitching staff.
After a banner rookie season on the Farm that
saw him post a 6-3 record to go with a 4.41 ERA,
Kunkel hit hard times.
In 1984 his ERA ballooned to a fat 5.42. "I lost
a lot of tight games that year," said Kunkel, who
finished the year with three wins in 11 decisions.
"But if you know the way (Marquess) coaches, you
know he's not going to stick with you if you're not
throwing well. 1 was satisfied with my pitching."
His 1984 season appears rosy when compared to

his 1985 campaign. Personal tragedy, the death of
his father Bill, a veteran American League umpire,
had Kunkel thinking about anything but baseball.
"Last year, with my Dad, there was no way my
mind was going to be out here," Kunkel said,
pointing to the Sunken Diamond field. "I sort of
alienated the team ... 1 went my own way."
Kunkel worked only 40 innings, and although his
record was a respectable 2-2, his ERA jumped
again, this time to 6.08.
For his last season at Stanford, his last hurrah as
it were, Kunkel did all he could to regroup.
"I had a good summer," he said. "I got it into my
mind what 1 wanted to do . .. and tried to carry that
thought into the spring."
Before the season started, Marquess saw some
thing he liked in the "new" Kunkel — and he
named him to his starting rotation.
Three rocky outings later, however, Kunkel was
once again the odd man out of Marquess' plans.
<2 »n i ose State rocked him for four runs in three in

nings; then, two weeks later, UC-Santa Barbara
pounded out eight hits and scored six runs against
him — in less than two innings.
Kunkel didn't get another start for nearly a
month. On March 4, he began for the umpteenth
time another comeback. He pitched a complete
game against SJSU, allowing seven hits, to earn his
first win of the year. He also convinced Marquess
to give him another chance.
Kunkel threw 7-2/3 innings of six-hit relief
against Arizona State at Tempe. Then on
April 5, Kunkel arrived — again. Against UCLA in
Los Angeles, he pitched eight shutout innings to
notch his first Six-Pac victory of the year.
Kunkel won again last week in Berkeley, going
five innings in Stanford's 9-4 win over California.
And then there was yesterday.
"Hey, it's my senior year and its spring quarter,"
Kunkel beamed afterward. "I'm really having a lot
of fun out here."

throwing well. 1 was satisfied with my pitching."
His 1984 season appears rosy when compared to

his 1985 campaign. Personal tragedy, the death of
his father Bill, a veteran American League umpire,
had Kunkel thinking about anything but baseball.
"Last year, with my Dad, there was no way my
mind was going to be out here," Kunkel said,
pointing to the Sunken Diamond field. "I sort of
alienated the team ... 1 went my own way."
Kunkel worked only 40 innings, and although his
record was a respectable 2-2, his ERA jumped
again, this time to 6.08.
For his last season at Stanford, his last hurrah as
it were, Kunkel did all he could to regroup.
"I had a good summer," he said. "I got it into my
mind what 1 wanted to do . .. and tried to carry that
thought into the spring."
Before the season started, Marquess saw some
thing he liked in the "new" Kunkel — and he
named him to his starting rotation.
Three rocky outings later, however, Kunkel was
once again the odd man out of Marquess' plans.
<2 »n i ose State rocked him for four runs in three in

nings; then, two weeks later, UC-Santa Barbara
pounded out eight hits and scored six runs against
him — in less than two innings.
Kunkel didn't get another start for nearly a
month. On March 4, he began for the umpteenth
time another comeback. He pitched a complete
game against SJSU, allowing seven hits, to earn his
first win of the year. He also convinced Marquess
to give him another chance.
Kunkel threw 7-2/3 innings of six-hit relief
against Arizona State at Tempe. Then on
April 5, Kunkel arrived — again. Against UCLA in
Los Angeles, he pitched eight shutout innings to
notch his first Six-Pac victory of the year.
Kunkel won again last week in Berkeley, going
five innings in Stanford's 9-4 win over California.
And then there was yesterday.
"Hey, it's my senior year and its spring quarter,"
Kunkel beamed afterward. "I'm really having a lot
of fun out here."
Kevin Kunkel's career as a pitcher at Stanford has, in
many ways, resembled a towering fly ball hit to deep cen
ter field. You know, one of those drives that just might
have enough to clear the wall for a home run. Maybe.
It goes up, way up. And back, way back. For a moment,
there's anticipation — this one's got a chance.
And then, it comes down, way down. And, smack, right
into the mitt of a back-pedaling fielder on the warning
track. Sigh, just another long out.
Kunkel, who came to Stanford from Leonardo, N.J.,

four years ago as a top recruit, has at times fallen just
short of lofty expectations. And his travails have left more
than a few fans wondering, "What if?"
Yesterday, however, Kunkel may have finally found the
range. Or maybe he finally got some luck, something like
a tailwind that turns a popup into a round-tripper. These
days, Kunkel's hits are falling in.
His 5-2 complete-game win in the first game of yester
day's doubleheader with UCLA pulled Stanford into a tie
with the Bruins atop the standings in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division.
"The key for us today," Marquess said after his team
finished a sweep of the Bruins with a 6-5 second-game

win, "was Kunkel going nine innings. He really saved our
pitching staff."
"He had great stuff out there," catcher John Ramos
said of the senior right-hander who picked up his fourth
win in seven decisions this year. "He was coming right at
them, challenging them."
Kunkel survived a shaky first inning — in which he
allowed three UCLA singles but no runs — and Bill
Haselman's tape measure, two-run home run in the fourth
before settling down to hold the Bruins hitless through the
final 5-1/3 frames.
"1 was probably a little excited in the early in
nings ... 1 was getting the ball up," said Kunkel,
who walked four and struck out five on the after
noon. "Then I relaxed and found a good rhythm."
The going hasn't always been so smooth for
Kunkel, the only senior on Stanford's pitching staff.
After a banner rookie season on the Farm that
saw him post a 6-3 record to go with a 4.41 ERA,
Kunkel hit hard times.
In 1984 his ERA ballooned to a fat 5.42. "I lost
a lot of tight games that year," said Kunkel, who
finished the year with three wins in 11 decisions.
"But if you know the way (Marquess) coaches, you
know he's not going to stick with you if you're not
throwing well. 1 was satisfied with my pitching."
