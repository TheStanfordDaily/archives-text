# A
						large peak among the valleys for Kunkel
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Kevin Kunkel's career as a pitcher at Stanford has, in
many ways, resembled a towering fly ball hit to deep cen
ter field. You know, one of those drives that just might
have enough to clear the wall for a home run. Maybe.
It goes up, way up. And back, way back. For a moment,
there's anticipation — this one's got a chance.
And then, it comes down, way down. And, smack, right
into the mitt of a back-pedaling fielder on the warning
track. Sigh, just another long out.
Kunkel, who came to Stanford from Leonardo, N.J.,

four years ago as a top recruit, has at times fallen just
short of lofty expectations. And his travails have left more
than a few fans wondering, "What if?"
Yesterday, however, Kunkel may have finally found the
range. Or maybe he finally got some luck, something like
a tailwind that turns a popup into a round-tripper. These
days, Kunkel's hits are falling in.
His 5-2 complete-game win in the first game of yester
day's doubleheader with UCLA pulled Stanford into a tie
with the Bruins atop the standings in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division.
"The key for us today," Marquess said after his team
finished a sweep of the Bruins with a 6-5 second-game

win, "was Kunkel going nine innings. He really saved our
pitching staff."
"He had great stuff out there," catcher John Ramos
said of the senior right-hander who picked up his fourth
win in seven decisions this year. "He was coming right at
them, challenging them."
Kunkel survived a shaky first inning — in which he
allowed three UCLA singles but no runs — and Bill
Haselman's tape measure, two-run home run in the fourth
before settling down to hold the Bruins hitless through the
final 5-1/3 frames.
