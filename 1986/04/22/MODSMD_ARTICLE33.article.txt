# Sailors win twice in Santa Cruz
## Stanford cruises to North Series title 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
It was a lovely weekend for sailing. Who wouldn't have
been happy out on the waters of Santa Cruz with a good
breeze and the sun shining? It's a fair guess, however, to
say that the teams competing against the Stanford sailing
team in the North Series Seven and Team Regatta weren't
too thrilled.
The Cardinal sailing team had its difficulties, but
cruised to victory nonetheless to capture berths in future
district-wide events. "There was no real challenge,"
Coach Joe Petrucci said.
If they were no real challenge, some teams did good im
itations posing as challengers on Saturday. After A
division races, the Stanford team of Rich Bergsend and
Marika Fussganger was 10 points behind Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. It took strong finishes in the B-division by
Dan Buckstaff and Suzi Pritchett to make up the differ
ence that gave the Cardinal a one-point win.
"Overall, we sailed real well," Petrucci said.
The final results had Stanford first with 27 points fol
lowed by Cal Poly with 28. California with 37, Santa Cruz
with 40 and California Maritime Academy with 45.
The victory gave Stanford the overall North Series
crown and the title of Northern California Intercollegiate
Champions. They will be representing Northern Califor
nia in District Championships in two weeks.
If Saturday was no challenge, then Sunday could only
be described as a breeze for the Cardinal boats in team
competition. Facing San Jose, Cal Poly and California,
Stanford came away with an easy victory.
But even easy victories are not without surprises. Stan
ford again had trouble against Cal Poly when the Cardinal
boat of Bergsend and Fussganger was damaged, leaving
them sailing with one sail. The crippled boat was useful
enough even in this condition to cause a hindrance to the
Cal Poly boats. This allowed the two other Cardinal boats
to finish high enough for the needed win.
"It was very interesting," Petrucci said. "The unex
pected factor enabled us to show our stuff."
In other competition the women's teams of Rona Sisson
with Alvina O'Brien and Mary Boyce with Buffy Wendt
also sailed well. "They were exceptionally good," Petrucci
said. "They have a real good shot at upsetting the
women's leaders now."

The Stanford sailing team enjoyed more than the weather last weekend in Santa Cruz, posting victories both
Saturday and Sunday to win the North Series Seven and Team Regatta. The Cardinal thus clinched the entire
North Series title, despite a second-day accident that left Rich Bergsend and Marika Fussganger with only
one sail. The Stanford pair was still able to hinder a Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo boat enough to allow two
Cardinal crews to sail to victory.
