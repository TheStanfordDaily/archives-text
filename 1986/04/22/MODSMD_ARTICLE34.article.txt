# Cardinal shut out in UOP tournament
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff writer 
The Stanford women's softball team lost its bat
ting stroke, and in the process fell to both New
Mexico and California in the two remaining West
ern Region tournament games played last weekend
at the University of Pacific.
In the first game against California, the Cardinal
held tough, trailing by only a run entering the latter
innings.
But as has been the case for most of the season,
Stanford could not find the offensive groove in the
crucial final innings. California, on the other hand,
pounded out four more insurance runs en route to
its 5-0 victory.
Stanford Coach Cathy Lincoln had high praise for
the Bears afterwards, "Each time I see them I'm
more impressed. I think it's the most solid Cal team
that I've seen. Good pitching, good hitting," she
said.
Ranked ninth in the nation, the Bears went on to
claim the tournament championship.
The New Mexico game paralled the earlier Stan
ford setback, with the Lobos earning a 6-0 shutout.
"Defense pulled together, but we just didn't
produce offensively," Lincoln said. "Not aggressive
at the plate, not taking charge."
Lincoln added that much of the Cardinal batting
woes have stemmed from Stanford's inability to lay
off the bad pitches.
"We worried more about it (the hitting slump)
and we're trying really hard. I think that's hurt us,"
Lincoln said. "Can't win unless you score a run."
With a couple days off before a road game at
UCLA, Stanford will try to get some "intense work
in the (batting) cage," according to Lincoln.
The end of last week's tournament also spells
temporary relief for starter Lisa Buchanan, who
should have been sponsored for her marathon ap
pearances. Buchanan pitched all three tournament
games in addition to completing two previous
games just prior to tournament action.
Stanford's other starter, Betsy Watson, will be
ready for the UCLA roadtrip.
