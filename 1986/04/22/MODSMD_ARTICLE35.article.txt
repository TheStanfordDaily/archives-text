# New speed for Card track
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
It's an age-old coaching dilemma: Do you draft the
best athlete, or do you try to fill your needs? Recently
the Stanford track team has been able to attract great
distance runners, but what it has really needed is
sprinters. The cross country team keeps on winning
and winning, while the track team is hampered by a
lack of speed.
But this year's recruiting class may just change that
dilemma. Along with his usual flock of distance stand
outs, Coach Brooks Johnson was able to sign one of
the nation's premier sprinters.
Last week, Gus Envela, the Oregon prep record
holder at 100 meters, 200 and 400, and a 1984 Olym
pian for his native country, Equitorial Guinea, an
nounced that he will attend Stanford.
With personal bests of 10.49 seconds in the 100,
21.1 in the 200 and 47.1 in the 400 Envela's impact
should be immediate. "He's the stopper we've needed
in the sprints. This year we've been losing 25 to 30
points every dual meet. He would stop that," Johnson
said.
Envela, who hopes to be a doctor, attributes his
choice largely to Stanford's academic reputation. "I
want a diploma that's going to mean something. I've
always felt that Stanford rose above the others, and of

fered me the dual excellence of academics and a great
track program," Envela told The Daily last night in a
phone interview.
Both Johnson and Envela are hoping that he will
also be able to help rejuvenate the Cardinal's depleted
sprint corps. "It's tough in the college situation for a
freshman to assume the position of leader, but I think I
can help," Envela said.
Johnson agreed. "He's got a lot of what we lack and
a lot of what we need," he said. "They (the other
sprinters) will either be encouraged and inspired, or in
timidated; hopefully, they'll be encouraged."
In the distance races, the Cardinal also signed some
top prospects. Bill Crowley from Seeconk, Mass.,
Carol Gray from La Porte, Ind. and Brenda Steenhof
from Ontario, Canada, have all committed to Stanford.
Johnson considers Gray the top recruit in the
country and Steenhof the top Canadian recruit.
Crowley, who has posted times of 4:24 in the mile and
9:30 in the two-mile, was also a number one recruit.
Together the three form the base of a class which
Johnson thinks "could possibly be the best we've ever
had."
Johnson is still waiting on the decision of two twin
brothers, Erik and Mark Mastalir. The two siblings,
who currently have the best times in the country at
3,200 meters, are reportedly still deciding between
Stanford and a couple of Ivy League schools.
