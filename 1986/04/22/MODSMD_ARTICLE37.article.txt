## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
This year has been good to the
Stanford women's gymnastics
team. Not only did the team have
a strong season, but it has also just
completed one of the best recruit
ing years the program has ever
had.
Four gymnasts have committed
to Stanford, while three more
remain undecided. However,
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina is
still pleased. "We'll have had a
great recruiting year, even if only
the top two come in," he said.
The two gymnasts he referred to
are Dina Amoroso and Susan
Banta. Amoroso hails from the
Kipps Gymnastics Club in Placen
tia, coached by Dennis Mal
ley. She was her club's Athlete of
the Year from 1983-1985, placed
fourth in the 1985 Sports Festival
and has scored as high as 37.80 in
all-around at the elite level.
"Dina's going to be a great col
legiate gymnast," Sardina
predicted. "She will help us in
every event."
The second of the pair, Banta,
lives in Richardson, Texas. In a
recent meet, she scored 38.80 in
the all-around for an average of
9.7 on each event. Banta was the
1985 Texas Class One champion,
was runner-up in the Class One
Regional and is a member of the
high school All-American team.
"Susan is one heck of an ath
lete," Sardina said. "She's good,
plain flat-out good."
Next on the list of recruits is a
local girl from Palo Alto; Becky
Ashton. Considered one of the top

high school gymnasts in the
country, she is averaging 37 in the
all-around this season. "She is also
a Fine catch," Sardina said.
Rounding out the quartet ot
committed gymnasts is Jennifer
Matsumura from Portland, Ore.
She is a national Class One com
petitor and scored 36 in the all
around in the recent Western Na
tional meet.
Sardina has his eye on three
more gymnasts, who have not yet
committed to any school. One of
these prospects is Christy Stitser of
Reno, Nev., who has been a Class
One competitor for five years and
is very strong on the balance
beam. She is currently leaning
towards California, where she has
been offered a scholarship.
Leaning towards Stanford is
Kimberly Laughlin, an elite level
gymnast from San Diego. As Cali
fornia and Washington have of
fered her scholarships, she is
deliberating whether she can come
to Stanford.
The last gymnast Sardina is en
couraging to come is Marietta
Frey, from Lexington, Mass. She is
also a Class One athlete and
placed second in all-around at the
1984 Class One Championships.
Sardina is pleased with this
year's recruiting. "It's great," he
said. "We're only losing one ath
lete (senior Pam Blom), but we're
getting two great gymnasts," he
said. "There's only one senior
(Nancy Goldsmith) on next year's
team, but we could put in a group
of athletes who could give us an
average of 185 or 186." This
season, the Cardinal averaged
181.
