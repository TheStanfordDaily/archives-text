# An adventure to worlds unknown
## 
### VLADINA HESS Staff writer 
Have you ever dreamed of par
ticipating in a journey around the
world? Of venturing into unknown
lands? Of spending days at sea,
and landing in a completely new
country, with a completely new
culture?
Well, come September, junior
Karol Aure will be doing just that
â€” and what's more, she'll be
doing it as part of a community
service project.
Aure will participate in one

Feature

phase of a program called Opera
tion Raleigh, a four-year science
and service expedition that con
sists of some 40 smaller expedi
tions in over 30 countries around
the globe.
Operation Raleigh is the idea of
Great Britain's Prince Charles and
involves more than 4,000 young
people between the ages of 18 and
24, according to Aure. More than
1,500 of the participants are from

the United States.
The expedition, named after
English explorer Sir Walter
Raleigh, began in 1984 in Raleigh,
N.C., and has been progressing in
relatively short three- to four
month trips that will eventually
land in England sometime in
1988.
Previous expeditions have
already been in Chile, Honduras
and the Caribbean, Aure said. Up
coming phases, she noted, will be
in Japan, Australia and New
Zealand.
During her expedition to New
Zealand, the first month will be
spent doing marine biology re
search on board the 225-foot flag
ship, the Sir Walter Raleigh, Aure
said. The second month will be
spent on land and will feature
mountaineering, insect and bird
studies and ice climbing. It will
also test her leadership abilities,
Aure said. The last month will be
spent working on National Park
Projects.
When asked why she was inter
ested in such an expedition, Aure
mentioned a basic interest in other
places. Aure spent last summer in
Ecuador and is currently working for
a travel agency. She noted that her
travel interests are more on the
"bizarre" side. Aure said that travel
to Europe is "quite known" whereas
such an expedition means going to
the unknown. She said she is most
excited about the ice-climbing and
on-ship research.
Aure said she heard about the ex
pedition by word of mouth. The ap
plication, according to Aure, stressed
"outward bound leadership with the
desire to promote world unity and in
crease scientific knowledge." Their
findings, she added, will be published
upon completion of the expedition.
Part of the application process is a
"selection weekend," which Aure
said was "like bootcamp." Appli
cants, according to a brochure put out
by Operation Raleigh, are "given a
series of physical and mental chal

lenges of the kind to be expected on
an expedition."
Aure said they had to swim, re
enact emergency situations and play
"games." Many of the games des
cribed by Aure involved some kind of
surprise, such as running around a
corner and coming face to face with a
tiger. Aure said that at first she
panicked, until she realized that it
was probably on loan from the zoo.
In another game, she found a boa
constrictor in her sleeping bag. All of
these surprises are to make certain
that a person can mentally handle
many of the unexpected situations
which could occur on such expedi
tions, Aure said.
Aure will be stopping-out next fall
to participate in the expedition. The
tuition for the three months will be
over $5,000. Aure hopes to raise the
funds herself and is hoping for dona
tions from corporate sponsors.
For all those students who would
be interested in such adventures, the
expedition will be accepting applica
tions until 1987. Write to Operation
Raleigh, 109 East Jones Street,
Raleigh, N.C. 27611.
