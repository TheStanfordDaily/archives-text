Women's water polo
After defeating Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
9-2 in the first game of its own Stanford In
vitational Saturday, the Cardinal women's
water polo team couldn't return to its win
ning form the rest of the weekend.
Stanford played respectably against open
teams consisting mostly of graduate students
from California and Davis, losing 10-5 and
7-4, respectively.
"Just to do okay against those teams is
pretty good," Lorna Thornton said. "Open
teams are usually better than college teams."
In its next game, however, the Cardinal
played poorly and lost to the University of
San Diego 8-3.
"That was really the most disappointing
game," Thornton said. "It should have been
closer."
Despite its 1-3 showing this weekend,
Stanford is one of the top college teams in
the nation and will assuredly compete at the
National Championships April 30-May 2 at
Harvard.

The top five teams from California are
invited to the championships, and the Card
inal is currently one of the top two teams in
the state along with USD.
"We should have a pretty good chance (at
Harvard)," Thornton said. "We're unde
feated as far as the college teams go."
Thornton indicated that, if all goes as ex
pected, the Cardinal should play USD again
in the final game because the Eastern teams
are not as competitive as the teams from
California.
Cycling
Competing without many of its regular
riders, the Stanford cycling team finished be
hind Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo twice this
weekend in road races.
"Our problem was we didn't have enough
people there," cyclist Tom Moyer said.
"You can do a lot more teamwork when
more people are there. And the probability
of placing is better."

Saturday at King City, Cal Poly won
easily, finishing ahead of UC-Davis and the
Cardinal.
Individually, Stanford was led by Dave
Bartholomew's second-place finish in the C
division. Laura Rodman took fourth place in
the women's race.
Sunday, the teams moved to San Ardo,
but the results were similar. The Cardinal
did finish closer, but the Mustangs prevailed
again.
Mike Collins recorded an impressive
third-place finish in the A division, and Rod
man moved up to third place in the women's
race.
Bartholomew raced in the B division Sun
day and placed among the top 10 riders. In
the C race, Stanford's Paul Brody captured
fifth place.
The Cardinal races in its final criterium of
the regular season next weekend at
Berkeley. Stanford has placed first in its first
two criterium races this season and is count
ing on another strong performance at
Berkeley.

Each school participating at the National
Championships counts four of its regular
season scores along with the three races
taking place at the championships. Stanford
has two strong criterium scores and two
average road race scores to count toward the
championships, so a strong criterium next
weekend would greatly enhance the Card
inal's hopes at the NCAAs.
Men's lacrosse
It took the Stanford mens lacrosse team
five hours to drive to Humboldt for Satur
day's match but only one quarter to prove
that it was the better team.
The Cardinal scored 12 first-quarter goals
en route to a 28-6 thrashing of Humboldt.
"It was just a romp," Stanford's John
Patrick said, noting that Humboldt has only
recently fielded a lacrosse team.
If a hat trick (three goals in one game) is
the sign of an outstanding game, then the

Cardinal's John Cox was doubly outstanding
Saturday as he recorded six goals.
Patrick, the nation's leading scorer, added
four goals and seven assists to the onslaught.
Lake Price registered five goals and two as
sists.
And the list goes on. . . . Dave Adams.
Don Kendall and Greg Simon each contrib
uted three goals.
Patrick was especially pleased by the mar
gin of victory because the Cardinal took only
10 players to Humboldt, meaning that the
team could not substitute. Everybody played
each position, he said.
The match also marked the return to
prominence of Stanford's Peter Haven, who
has missed much of the season due to injur
ies. Haven, one of the most fit athletes on
the team, figures to be a key to the Card
inal's post-season hopes as an anchor to the
team's defense.
Because he has missed most of this season.
Haven indicated that he might come back
next season for a fifth year so that he can
play another year of lacrosse.
