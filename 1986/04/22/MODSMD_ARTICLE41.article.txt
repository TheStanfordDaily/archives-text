Ex-Libyan diplomat arrested in Italy
Italian authorities said yesterday that they have arrested a former
Libyan diplomat in connection with a plot to kill the American, Saudi
and Egyptian ambassadors to Italy, and West Berlin police also an
nounced the arrest of a suspect in the discotheque bombing that
prompted last week's U.S. retaliatory attacks on Libya.
In London, police charged a Jordanian, Nezar Hindawi, 31, with at
tempting last Thursday to blow up an El A 1 Airlines jumbo jet. Another
man also has been detained for questioning in the case.
West Berlin police said that they arrested a stateless Palestinian in
connection with the April 5 bombing of La Belle Discotheque that killed
U.S. Army Sgt. Kenneth Ford and a Turkish woman.
In Rome, Public Prosecutor Domenico Sico confirmed that a 47-year
old Libyan, identified as Arebi Mohammed Fituri, of Tripoli, has been
taken into custody in a plot to kill U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb and
the Saudi and Egyptian envoys. The plot was discovered more than a
year ago but was only now disclosed by the Italians.
Police sources said the suspect was once an administrative clerk in the
Libyan embassy in Rome. They said he is suspected, along with another
Libyan diplomat, of providing a pistol more than a year ago with which a
third Libyan was to have assassinated the three ambassadors.
"This is a concrete sign of the Italian government determination to
fight against terrorism," said Antonio Ghirelli, a spokesman for Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi, confirming the arrest. Neither Ghirelli nor the
prosecutor's office would elaborate on the plot.
Europe tightens checks on Libyans
LUXEMBOURG — Twelve European nations decided yesterday to
impose further restrictions on the size and activities of Libyan diplomatic
missions, or -people's bureaus," to show displeasure with the regime of
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy for its alleged involvement in ter
rorist acts.
The decision, taken by foreign ministers of the European Community
states, was intended to answer American appeals for coordinated
punitive actions against Tripoli by the allies and to forestall the threat of
further U.S. military strikes, diplomats said. It built on a general agree
ment on diplomatic sanctions approved April 14 at a community
meeting in The Hague.
In Washington, the Reagan Administration welcomed the accord,
saying it sends "a clear message to Khadafy that the Europeans, like the
United States, will not tolerate this scourge," according to State Depart
ment spokesman Bernard Kalb.
The ministers refrained from shutting down the "people's bureaus"
altogether, as Britain's Geoffrey Howe had previously urged, or taking
steps to pressure Khadafy by hurting the Libyan economy. West Ger
many, in particular, has strongly rejected economic sanctions, saying
they do not work.
The growing anxiety that new American bombing raids on Libya
would unleash a fresh wave of terrorist reprisals heightened a sense of
urgency among the ministers to reach a consensus on a package of
measures that would show they were actively committed to halting a
continuing cycle of violence.
Today's accord calls for Libyan diplomats and consular representa
tives to be reduced in number to the minimum required to handle their
official business. European embassies in Tripoli will be cut similarly.
Reagan urges anti-terrorist action
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, who aides said is increasingly
frustrated by lack of allied support for U.S. military and economic ac
tions against Libya, said yesterday he will appeal personally for con
certed action against international terrorism when he meets leaders of
six industrialized democracies at an economic summit in Tokyo next
week.
"We're going to the summit to see what we can work out together,"
Reagan said in an interview with wire service reporters.
The president is scheduled to depart Friday for Indonesia and Japan,
the longest trip of his presidency, after giving what his aides said would
be a major speech here Wednesday emphasizing democratic gains in the
world during his administration and defending his anti-terrorist policy.
Reagan's disappointment at the failure of any European ally other
than Britain to endorse last week's U.S. bombing raid on Libya was evi
dent in yestersay's interview in which the president said he couldn't "see
any justification" for France's refusal to allow U.S. Fills based in Brit
ain to use French airspace en route to Libya.
"I have to criticize that," the president said. "I can't see any justifica
tion for it. They had the evidence. They, themselves, were taking actions
such as sending (Libyan) diplomats home."
Both France and Britain joined the United States yesterday in the
U.N. Security Council in vetoing a U.N. resolution that would have con
demned the U.S. attack on Libya.
In his interview yesterday, Reagan said some allies had privately sug
gested "that we look seriously at real major action" against Libya. A
senior U.S. official, noting that France was the only ally that made this
suggestion, dismissed it as "posturing" from a nation that did not want to
risk openly associating with a military response to terrorism.
Afghans under heavy siege
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Soviet and Afghan government forces
trying to cut critical supply routes of the resistance movement inside Af
ghanistan are threatening the main guerrilla base in eastern Paktia prov
ince, according to Afghan sources in Pakistan.
Several of the sources, reached by telephone, suggested that the
mujaheddin. or resistance fighters, in Paktia were in a more desperate
position than during previous Soviet offensives in the province. They
also described the fighters as demoralized, especially over their lack of
effective air defenses, despite reports that the Reagan Administration
has decided to supply sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles to them.
The sources, located in Peshawar and Miramshah, two towns near the
Afghan border, said the Soviet and government troops, backed by ar
tillery and air support, have inflicted heavy losses on the resistance
fighters in their first offensive against the supply trails since the end of
winter.
Soviet-led forces also reportedly have killed or wounded hundreds of
rebels and civilians in the southern city of Kandahar, according to Af
ghan sources in the Pakistani town of Quetta.
Death toll at 350 in boat disaster
DHAKA. Bangladesh — The death toll in Bangladesh's worst ferry
boat disaster rose to over 350 yesterday as divers continued to retrieve
bodies from a steamer that collapsed during a storm, local administrators
said.
Resue workers, who had pulled 195 bodies from the sunken ship by
last night, said more than 50 bodies were still trapped inside locked com
partments of the two-deck steamer.
About 100 others were missing after the boat capsized in a storm in
the Dhaleshwari River 30 miles east of here. Winds reached speeds of
over 60 mph during the storm's peak.
Villagers reported to police that they found scores of bodies floating
downstream. Rescue workers used rowing boats to ferry bodies from the
salvaged steamer to the nearest town of Munshiganj.
Survivors said that the steamer had more than 1,000 passengers on
board. Officials called the disaster the worst of its kind in Bangladesh's
15-year history.

also described the fighters as demoralized, especially over their lack of
effective air defenses, despite reports that the Reagan Administration
has decided to supply sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles to them.
The sources, located in Peshawar and Miramshah, two towns near the
Afghan border, said the Soviet and government troops, backed by ar
tillery and air support, have inflicted heavy losses on the resistance
fighters in their first offensive against the supply trails since the end of
winter.
Soviet-led forces also reportedly have killed or wounded hundreds of
rebels and civilians in the southern city of Kandahar, according to Af
ghan sources in the Pakistani town of Quetta.
Death toll at 350 in boat disaster
DHAKA. Bangladesh — The death toll in Bangladesh's worst ferry
boat disaster rose to over 350 yesterday as divers continued to retrieve
bodies from a steamer that collapsed during a storm, local administrators
said.
Resue workers, who had pulled 195 bodies from the sunken ship by
last night, said more than 50 bodies were still trapped inside locked com
partments of the two-deck steamer.
About 100 others were missing after the boat capsized in a storm in
the Dhaleshwari River 30 miles east of here. Winds reached speeds of
over 60 mph during the storm's peak.
Villagers reported to police that they found scores of bodies floating
downstream. Rescue workers used rowing boats to ferry bodies from the
salvaged steamer to the nearest town of Munshiganj.
Survivors said that the steamer had more than 1,000 passengers on
board. Officials called the disaster the worst of its kind in Bangladesh's
15-year history.
Ex-Libyan diplomat arrested in Italy
Italian authorities said yesterday that they have arrested a former
Libyan diplomat in connection with a plot to kill the American, Saudi
and Egyptian ambassadors to Italy, and West Berlin police also an
nounced the arrest of a suspect in the discotheque bombing that
prompted last week's U.S. retaliatory attacks on Libya.
In London, police charged a Jordanian, Nezar Hindawi, 31, with at
tempting last Thursday to blow up an El A 1 Airlines jumbo jet. Another
man also has been detained for questioning in the case.
West Berlin police said that they arrested a stateless Palestinian in
connection with the April 5 bombing of La Belle Discotheque that killed
U.S. Army Sgt. Kenneth Ford and a Turkish woman.
In Rome, Public Prosecutor Domenico Sico confirmed that a 47-year
old Libyan, identified as Arebi Mohammed Fituri, of Tripoli, has been
taken into custody in a plot to kill U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb and
the Saudi and Egyptian envoys. The plot was discovered more than a
year ago but was only now disclosed by the Italians.
Police sources said the suspect was once an administrative clerk in the
Libyan embassy in Rome. They said he is suspected, along with another
Libyan diplomat, of providing a pistol more than a year ago with which a
third Libyan was to have assassinated the three ambassadors.
"This is a concrete sign of the Italian government determination to
fight against terrorism," said Antonio Ghirelli, a spokesman for Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi, confirming the arrest. Neither Ghirelli nor the
prosecutor's office would elaborate on the plot.
Europe tightens checks on Libyans
LUXEMBOURG — Twelve European nations decided yesterday to
impose further restrictions on the size and activities of Libyan diplomatic
missions, or -people's bureaus," to show displeasure with the regime of
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy for its alleged involvement in ter
rorist acts.
The decision, taken by foreign ministers of the European Community
states, was intended to answer American appeals for coordinated
punitive actions against Tripoli by the allies and to forestall the threat of
further U.S. military strikes, diplomats said. It built on a general agree
ment on diplomatic sanctions approved April 14 at a community
meeting in The Hague.
In Washington, the Reagan Administration welcomed the accord,
saying it sends "a clear message to Khadafy that the Europeans, like the
United States, will not tolerate this scourge," according to State Depart
ment spokesman Bernard Kalb.
The ministers refrained from shutting down the "people's bureaus"
altogether, as Britain's Geoffrey Howe had previously urged, or taking
steps to pressure Khadafy by hurting the Libyan economy. West Ger
many, in particular, has strongly rejected economic sanctions, saying
they do not work.
The growing anxiety that new American bombing raids on Libya
would unleash a fresh wave of terrorist reprisals heightened a sense of
urgency among the ministers to reach a consensus on a package of
measures that would show they were actively committed to halting a
continuing cycle of violence.
Today's accord calls for Libyan diplomats and consular representa
tives to be reduced in number to the minimum required to handle their
official business. European embassies in Tripoli will be cut similarly.
Reagan urges anti-terrorist action
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, who aides said is increasingly
frustrated by lack of allied support for U.S. military and economic ac
tions against Libya, said yesterday he will appeal personally for con
certed action against international terrorism when he meets leaders of
six industrialized democracies at an economic summit in Tokyo next
week.
"We're going to the summit to see what we can work out together,"
Reagan said in an interview with wire service reporters.
The president is scheduled to depart Friday for Indonesia and Japan,
the longest trip of his presidency, after giving what his aides said would
be a major speech here Wednesday emphasizing democratic gains in the
world during his administration and defending his anti-terrorist policy.
Reagan's disappointment at the failure of any European ally other
than Britain to endorse last week's U.S. bombing raid on Libya was evi
dent in yestersay's interview in which the president said he couldn't "see
any justification" for France's refusal to allow U.S. Fills based in Brit
ain to use French airspace en route to Libya.
"I have to criticize that," the president said. "I can't see any justifica
tion for it. They had the evidence. They, themselves, were taking actions
such as sending (Libyan) diplomats home."
Both France and Britain joined the United States yesterday in the
U.N. Security Council in vetoing a U.N. resolution that would have con
demned the U.S. attack on Libya.
In his interview yesterday, Reagan said some allies had privately sug
gested "that we look seriously at real major action" against Libya. A
senior U.S. official, noting that France was the only ally that made this
suggestion, dismissed it as "posturing" from a nation that did not want to
risk openly associating with a military response to terrorism.
Afghans under heavy siege
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Soviet and Afghan government forces
