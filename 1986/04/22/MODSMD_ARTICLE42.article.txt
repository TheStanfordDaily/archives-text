# Reporters visit U.S. raid targets

BENGHAZI, Libya â€” The main civilian and
military airport here, bombed on April 15 by
American warplanes, was open and operating nor
mally again yesterday, but there remained visible
signs that both civilian and military Libyan planes
suffered from the raid.
Quick repair work masked some of the damage,
and some wreckage had been dragged behind a
hangar; there, the tail sections of two large Soviet
made transport helicopters lay charred and twisted.
The main rotors nearby looked like enormous
burned spiders. Littered across the ground were the
plastic fins, the fuses and some of the unexploded
cones of "bomblets" from American cluster
bombs.

Precise information about the damage inflicted
on military targets in Libya remains scarce.
Reporters have not been allowed to visit any purely
military sites. But after escorted trips to seven
other places where American bombs landed, here
and in the capital, there is mounting evidence that
the U.S. attacks were considerably less precise than
the Pentagon has claimed.
At the same time, there are indications that the
military damage was more than the Libyans are
willing to admit and that some claims of civilian
casualties are exaggerated.
Both here and in Tripoli, 400 miles to west,
bombs appear to have cut wide swaths through at

least two civilian areas that were not close to any
targets acknowledged by Washington. There was
also damage evident here to buildings near military
installations.
Here in Benghazi, a city of 400,000, an elemen
tary school was shattered by the impact of blast and
shrapnel from at least two explosive devices.
Such errors were more critical in residential
neighborhoods. Around Bin Ashour Street in
Tripoli, near the French Embassy, there were at
least four clear bomb craters visible among col
lapsed houses and apartment buildings four hours
after the raid. At least 14 persons died there, ac
cording to officials at one morgue.
