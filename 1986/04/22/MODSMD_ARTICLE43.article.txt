# College presidents assail federal policies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The nation's
universities face "serious damage"
from uncoordinated federal policy
changes, the head of a group
representing top U.S. colleges said
yesterday asserting that billions of
dollars in annual aid and donations
are at stake.
Robert Rosenzweig, president of
the Association of American Univer
sities, said that the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law could cut up to
$2.7 billion from federal aid to higher
education in fiscal 1987 and that a
House-passed tax-reform bill would
"substantially diminish" incentives
for donating large gifts of stocks to
colleges, resulting in losses of $600
million a year.
Moreover, Rosenzweig said at a

news conference with several univer
sity presidents, another $300 million
a year would be lost because of a
Reagan Administration proposal to
reduce reimbursements for university
research. Such policies constitute "a
real and present danger" to univer
sities, he said.
Similarly, Harvard University Pres
ident Derek Bok called the tax and
budget proposals a "pincer move
ment" that will put universities and
colleges in a "difficult bind indeed."
In addition, Stanford University
President Donald Kennedy said that
two-thirds of the nation's basic re
search is conducted in universities but
that federal budget constraints are
making reimbursements for that re
search "more vulnerable to chal

lenge."
Kennedy singled out the National
Institutes of Health, charging that
during the last three years it has
"tried to withhold reimbursement
funds from the universities in order to
meet budget targets."
Congressional committees have
restored the funds, he said, but now
the Administration is proposing a
limit on reimbursable administrative
costs. This ceiling, scheduled to
become effective in July, would cut
$100 million in overall reimburse
ments this fiscal year and $300 mil
lion in succeeding years, Kennedy
said.
The university presidents, whose
organization represents 54 U.S. insti
tutions. are lobbying against this pro

posal and others that they say will
harm the nation's education system
and, thus, society in general.
For its part, the Reagan Adminis
tration has asserted that increased en
dowments to colleges are providing
enough money to make up for budget
cuts. But Bok of Harvard, which
often is cited as a recipient of huge
gifts, called this view "seriously dis
torted." He said double-digit infla
tion and a lackluster stock market
"washed out" investment profits in
the 19705, and only in the last three
years has that situation been
reversed.
Of the nation's 3,000 colleges, just
about 50 receive as much as 5 percent
to 10 percent of their operating funds
from endowments, Bok said.
