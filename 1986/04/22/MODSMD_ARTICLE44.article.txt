Reagan backs tax hikes
WASHINGTON — Sailing against a storm of
opposition that has united industry and labor
groups, the Reagan Administration endorsed
yesterday steep increases in excise taxes on
tobacco, alcoholic beverages and motor fuels to
help finance federal income tax reform.
In testimony to the Senate Finance Commit
tee, J. Roger Mentz, assistant Treasury secretary
for tax policy, offered qualified support for a con
troversial plan by panel Chairman Bob Pack
wood (R-Ore.) to raise $75 billion in three years
by eliminating the ability of businesses to deduct
excise taxes from the amount of taxable corpor
ate income.
But Mentz was careful not to endorse Pack
wood's non-deductibility plan as written. Noting
that the committee chairman's proposal would
amount to a 54 percent across-the-board in
crease in all excise taxes, Mentz recommended
instead that some increases in certain excise taxes
should "be given a long hard look by the commit
tee."
"The Administration will entertain the possi
bility of selective increases in excise taxes to
create a revenue-neutral package," Mentz said.
"We would have a problem supporting a 54 per
cent across-the-board increase in excise taxes."
But Sen. David H. Pryor (D Ark.), a strong
opponent of the Packwood proposal, told Mentz:
"I think your position is very tortured." Commit
tee observers believe that a solid majority of the
panel would vote down the Packwood plan as
proposed.
Mentz's testimony was offset by that of indus
tries, labor and special-interest groups that were
almost unanimously opposed to the proposed in
creases. Officials testifying on behalf of the
tobacco, wine, beer, distilled spirits and petro
leum industries claimed to represent "the most
heavily taxed" industry in the nation.
Moreover, representatives of labor and tax
reform groups argued that the sweeping increases
in excise taxes that would result from Packwood's
proposal would fall most severely on lower
income taxpayers and consumers.

Court rules for media
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, in a
major victory for the news media, ruled yester
day that people suing news organizations for libel
must overcome the difficult burden of proving
that the published statements about them were
false.
The 5-to-4 decision, written by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, overturned laws or court rulings
in at least nine states that require the media to
show that what they published was true.
The issue of which party has the burden of
proof is pivotal and often determines whether a
suit is even worth bringing. Until yesterday,
however, the constitutional requirements for
both public figure and private figure plaintiffs
had been unclear, libel lawyers said.
The case involved only suits by private individ
uals, who face fewer legal obstacles in pressing
libel suits than public figures. But experts said it
will apply as well to suits by public figures.
"The First Amendment," O'Connor said yes
terday, quoting a 1974 ruling, "requires that we
protect some falsehood in order to protect speech
that matters."
The ruling, which protects only reporting on is
sues of "public concern," drew a harsh dissent
from Justice John Paul Stevens, who called it
"pernicious." Stevens said the court "today
seems to believe that the character assassin has a
constitutional license to defame."
He argued that, under prior court decisions,
plaintiffs suing the media already have to prove
that a news organization acted carelessly or
negligently.
Reagan to obey SALT II
WASHINGTON — Despite repeated charges
of Soviet cheating, President Reagan decided
yesterday to go the "extra mile" once again to
comply with the unratified SALT II arms agree
ment by dismantling two older Poseidon missile
submarines as scheduled next month, Adminis

tration officials told the Los Angeles Times.
However, he called for at least four steps to
compensate for alleged Soviet treaty violations.
They include doubling the number of MX inter
continental ballistic missiles from 50 to 100; ac
celerating work on the small Midgetman ICBM
and on the advanced ("stealth") cruise missile;
and studying whether to put three warheads on
Minuteman II ICBMs that now have one war
head each.
Some of those steps could violate SALT II if
implemented without eliminating other weapons
to remain under the ceilings set by the agree
ment. But none of them would immediately
breach the agreement, officials said.
In the action, Reagan also appears to have
foregone his last good chance for abrogating an
agreement he has called "fatally flawed," al
though he has agreed "not to undercut" its provi
sions if the Soviets did the same.
Banks cut prime rate
WASHINGTON — Most of the nation's
major banks cut their prime lending rate yester
day from 9 to 8.5 percent, the lowest level in
eight years, and expectations that rates will drop
further sent the dollar reeling on foreign ex
change markets.
The cut in the prime lending rate — the key
rate banks charge for short-term business loans
— followed the Federal Reserve Board's decision
Friday to lower its discount rate to 6.5 percent
from 7 percent. The discount rate is the cost to fi
nancial institutions of borrowing from the Fed.
Stocks at record highs
NEW YORK — The stock market climbed to
record highs yesterday, benefiting from the latest
cuts in the Federal Reserve's discount rate and
the bank prime lending rate.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 15.50 to 1,855.90, surpassing the record
high of 1,855.03 it reached last Thursday.

record highs yesterday, benefiting from the latest
cuts in the Federal Reserve's discount rate and
the bank prime lending rate.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 15.50 to 1,855.90, surpassing the record
high of 1,855.03 it reached last Thursday.
Reagan backs tax hikes
WASHINGTON — Sailing against a storm of
opposition that has united industry and labor
groups, the Reagan Administration endorsed
yesterday steep increases in excise taxes on
tobacco, alcoholic beverages and motor fuels to
help finance federal income tax reform.
In testimony to the Senate Finance Commit
tee, J. Roger Mentz, assistant Treasury secretary
for tax policy, offered qualified support for a con
troversial plan by panel Chairman Bob Pack
wood (R-Ore.) to raise $75 billion in three years
by eliminating the ability of businesses to deduct
excise taxes from the amount of taxable corpor
ate income.
But Mentz was careful not to endorse Pack
wood's non-deductibility plan as written. Noting
that the committee chairman's proposal would
amount to a 54 percent across-the-board in
crease in all excise taxes, Mentz recommended
instead that some increases in certain excise taxes
should "be given a long hard look by the commit
tee."
"The Administration will entertain the possi
bility of selective increases in excise taxes to
create a revenue-neutral package," Mentz said.
"We would have a problem supporting a 54 per
cent across-the-board increase in excise taxes."
But Sen. David H. Pryor (D Ark.), a strong
opponent of the Packwood proposal, told Mentz:
"I think your position is very tortured." Commit
tee observers believe that a solid majority of the
panel would vote down the Packwood plan as
proposed.
Mentz's testimony was offset by that of indus
tries, labor and special-interest groups that were
almost unanimously opposed to the proposed in
creases. Officials testifying on behalf of the
tobacco, wine, beer, distilled spirits and petro
leum industries claimed to represent "the most
heavily taxed" industry in the nation.
Moreover, representatives of labor and tax
reform groups argued that the sweeping increases
in excise taxes that would result from Packwood's
proposal would fall most severely on lower
income taxpayers and consumers.

Court rules for media
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, in a
major victory for the news media, ruled yester
day that people suing news organizations for libel
must overcome the difficult burden of proving
that the published statements about them were
false.
The 5-to-4 decision, written by Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, overturned laws or court rulings
in at least nine states that require the media to
show that what they published was true.
The issue of which party has the burden of
proof is pivotal and often determines whether a
suit is even worth bringing. Until yesterday,
however, the constitutional requirements for
both public figure and private figure plaintiffs
had been unclear, libel lawyers said.
The case involved only suits by private individ
uals, who face fewer legal obstacles in pressing
libel suits than public figures. But experts said it
will apply as well to suits by public figures.
"The First Amendment," O'Connor said yes
terday, quoting a 1974 ruling, "requires that we
protect some falsehood in order to protect speech
that matters."
The ruling, which protects only reporting on is
sues of "public concern," drew a harsh dissent
from Justice John Paul Stevens, who called it
"pernicious." Stevens said the court "today
seems to believe that the character assassin has a
constitutional license to defame."
He argued that, under prior court decisions,
plaintiffs suing the media already have to prove
that a news organization acted carelessly or
negligently.
Reagan to obey SALT II
WASHINGTON — Despite repeated charges
of Soviet cheating, President Reagan decided
yesterday to go the "extra mile" once again to
comply with the unratified SALT II arms agree
ment by dismantling two older Poseidon missile
submarines as scheduled next month, Adminis

tration officials told the Los Angeles Times.
However, he called for at least four steps to
compensate for alleged Soviet treaty violations.
They include doubling the number of MX inter
continental ballistic missiles from 50 to 100; ac
celerating work on the small Midgetman ICBM
and on the advanced ("stealth") cruise missile;
and studying whether to put three warheads on
Minuteman II ICBMs that now have one war
head each.
Some of those steps could violate SALT II if
implemented without eliminating other weapons
to remain under the ceilings set by the agree
ment. But none of them would immediately
breach the agreement, officials said.
In the action, Reagan also appears to have
foregone his last good chance for abrogating an
agreement he has called "fatally flawed," al
though he has agreed "not to undercut" its provi
sions if the Soviets did the same.
Banks cut prime rate
WASHINGTON — Most of the nation's
major banks cut their prime lending rate yester
day from 9 to 8.5 percent, the lowest level in
eight years, and expectations that rates will drop
further sent the dollar reeling on foreign ex
change markets.
The cut in the prime lending rate — the key
rate banks charge for short-term business loans
— followed the Federal Reserve Board's decision
Friday to lower its discount rate to 6.5 percent
from 7 percent. The discount rate is the cost to fi
nancial institutions of borrowing from the Fed.
