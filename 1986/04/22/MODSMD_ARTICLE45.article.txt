Nixon for contra aid
SAN FRANCISCO — Former President Rich
ard Nixon said yesterday the United States
should seek allied economic action or impose a
military blockade to punish any future Libyan
sponsored terrorism because "the bombing op
tion" can't be used again.
Nixon told the annual luncheon of The Associ
ated Press he supported President Reagan's deci
sion to order air raids on Libyan a week ago.
But he said that tactic can't be used repeatedly
because gradual escalation "doesn't work with
fanatics" like Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy, and massive air raids would be unac
ceptable. The United States, he said, should urge
its economic partners to support a joint agree
ment to "cut off (Khadafy's) oil" if terrorism
continues.
Nixon claimed, however, that the U.S. attack
on Libya and terrorism in Europe will have less
impact on the United States in the long run than
the fighting in Nicaragua.
In a broad foreign policy speech, Nixon urged
U.S. aid to Nicaraguan Contra rebels and out
lined conditions for backing anti-communist
forces thoughout the world.

Titan flop ups costs
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE —The
Pentagon will have to budget use of a spy satellite
over Russia or use more reconnaissance planes
until the cause of Friday's Titan rocket explosion
is found, an expert said yesterday.
The $64 million Titan 34D booster exploded
five seconds into launch Friday at Vandenberg,
170 miles northwest of Los Angeles. The Air
Force would say only that the pay load was classi
fied, but several independent military space ex
perts said it was almost certainly a KH-11 spy
satellite.
The Titan's failure, coupled with the Jan. 28
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, inter
rupts the programs of the United State's two pri
mary launch vehicles for large payloads, such as
spy and communications satellites.
Lawyers bid for drug
LOS ANGELES — Lawyers for a paralyzed
woman who won a court battle to remove a
forced-feeding tube now say they want to prevent
her doctors from stopping intravenous morphine

doses.
The move by Elizabeth Bouvias doctors to
end pain-killing morphine doses was strictly a
medical decision and is unrelated to last week's
state appellate ruling which forced removal of the
stomach feeding tube. Deputy County Counsel
Daniel Mikesell said yesterday.
The 28-year-old quadriplegic has had cerebral
palsy since birth and also suffers from severe pro
gressive arthritis, an extremely painful condition.
Bouvia told the New York Times last week she
believes morphine is the only drug that will ease
her pain, and the detoxifying effects of withdraw
ing the narcotic would be agonizing. She said she
believes the decision to end the morphine was
punitive, based on the publicity she has attracted
with her lawsuits.
Today's weather
There will be morning low clouds today and
fog with local drizzle clearing later in the day.
Today will be cooler with highs from the upper
50s to mid-70s. Rumor has it that Lemley was
seen squandering his newly-earned scholarship at
an unnamed San Francisco pub.
