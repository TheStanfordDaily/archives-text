# Rally rips SDI plan

"Darth Vader" appeared before a crowd of more than
200 students and passers-by yesterday at a White Plaza
noon rally designed to protest Stanford's involvement
with "Star Wars" research.
The rally, spoasored by Stanford Action for Nuclear
Disarmament (STAND), addressed issues concerning the
amount and the implications of Stanford-based research
being undertaken for the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI), as the program is formally known.
"We're hoping to educate people about how impracti
cal Star Wars is and to draw attention to the amount of re
search being done on campus," according to one of the
rally's organizers, Scott Diamond, a graduate student in
applied physics.
Stanford was recently awarded a contract of $8.3 mil
lion in order to carry out S DI research on the free electron
laser, bringing the University's total contract to $11.3 mil
lion.
John Harris, head of operations at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, was the first of three speakers. He
discussed the morality of conducting military research in
general, and at Stanford in particular.
"It's been said that science has no moral value â€” that
it's neutral," according to Harris. Harris strongly
disagreed with that premise however. "It's nonsense to
say that T'm just a worker. . . that I don't have any partic
ipation in the way science is applied.' "
Referring to SDI as a "deliberate intention to upset the
balance of nuclear deterrence," Harris said, as a scientist,
he has no desire to "participate in the enterprise" of its
development, and urged "this institution and this student
body," in turn, to question the value of its deployment.
Terry Winograd, a professor in the Computer Science
Department who has refused to work on projects involved
with direct military funding, outlined two alternatives to
the dilemma presented when a University or other such
institution is asked to lend its "respectability authority" to
SDI by conducting the requisite research for its very de
velopment.
"You can either take the money and run,"he said, or
"we can use the position we have to raise the other side."
Winograd also explained many of the complications in
herent in the projected defense system, stating that, "It
just won't work. ... You can't make anything that com
plicated work the first time."
To highlight their protest, "Darth Vader" then made
his special guest appearance in a skit that involved ran
dom members of the audience. " Darth" was observed
luring Stanford researchers into developing a protec
tive umbrella to ward off Soviet missiles by offering them
a bundle of money.
When asked whether or not the "Strategic Deathstar
Initiative" would really even work, " Darth" responded by
saying "Of course! The president says so!"
In a simulated nuclear attack, Vader's "shield" clearly
failed in its attempts to ward off the abundant amount of
audience-launched incoming cardboard missiles.
Peace activist Peter Lumsdaine was the last scheduled
speaker for the rally.
According to Lumsdaine, "The most important ques
tions we can ask about Star Wars are, 'Why is it being
built?' and, 'Why is so much money being directed toward
it when it won't really work?' "
He partially answered his questions by denoting that
