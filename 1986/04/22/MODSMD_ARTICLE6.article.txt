# John Irving speaks on his world

### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
Quipping that he was "here to demonstrate
Disraeli's maxim that an author speaking of his
own book is as disgusting as a mother speaking
of her own children," author John Irving
opened his talk in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night on the book he is currently writing, "A
Prayer for Owen Meany."
Irving spent the majority of his hour on stage
reading excerpts from the novel, which he has
been working on for the past year-and-a-half,
and quickly endeared himself to the largely un
dergraduate crowd of about 300 with the energy
and affection with which he portrayed his char
acters.
Irving, claiming to be "an old-fashioned
structuralist," prefaced his readings by telling
the audience, "I really do believe in a begin
ning, middle and end, and my chapters demon
strate that belief."
Accordingly, Irving began reading aloud from
the first part of Chapter I of the book. In the ex
cerpt, he introduced the main character, Owen
Meany, a tiny and virtually "weightless" boy of
grammar school age who has a speech impedi
ment.
Irving remarked that he indicates Owen's
voice in the book by using capital letters."It
seems to me that is visually, for the reader, suf
ficiently irritating," Irving said. He added that it
is his hope that when the reader reads he will
suppose his "own worst voice," but when he
reads he is forced to interpret.

Irving's interpretation of Owen's nasal and
"damaged falsetto" left his audience in stitches,
although a sense of doom pervades the story.
John Wheelright, the narrator, is a boy of six
when the novel begins. His first words reveal
Owen's significance: "I am doomed to remem
ber a boy with a wrecked voice.... He is the
reason I believe in God."
In his first paragraph, John also reveals that
Owen is the instrument of his mother's death.
In a little league baseball game, Owen hits
one of the few balls he ever hits. In one scene,
he swings at the baseball and actually connects
with it, sending a foul ball into the stands and
striking John's mother's left temple.
John, fatherless when the book begins, is 11
when his mother dies without telling him or
anyone else who his father was. Only Owen is
sure that John's father is alive and that even if
he never comes forward. "God will identify
him."
For Irving, Owen's hit is not just a freakish
accident, but a religious event. Owen is con
vinced that he is part and participant of a divine
plan. The purpose of the book, Irving said, is to
say "that (Owen) might have a point."
Owen might be correct that God will tell John
who his father is. He does, after all, possess the
baseball. "I want to make you become less sure
(that Owen is not right)," Irving said. "So in
that sense, this is a religious novel."
Irving has written about 170 pages of "A
Prayer" so far. He anticipates another two or
three years of writing before completing the
novel.
