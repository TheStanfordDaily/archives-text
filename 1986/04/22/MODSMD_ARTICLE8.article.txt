# Africa group gets new leader
## 
### ANN MARSH 
Pearl-Alice Marsh of UC-Berkeley has
been selected as the new coordinator of
the Stanford-Berkeley Joint Center for
African Studies.
"Dr. Marsh's knowledge of Africa, ad
ministrative skill, energy and warmth will
enable her to unleash the dynamism of
African Studies on our two campuses,"
said Anthropology Prof. James Gibbs, Jr.,
the Stanford co-director. "She's already
bringing us closer together.
"I see nothing but opportunity ahead
for the joint center," Gibbs said. "It is a
real pleasure to work with not one, but
two outstanding communities of academic
Africanists. 1 believe we can make the
joint center one of the top Africa Studies
Centers in the country."
Marsh has had experience with both
Stanford and Berkeley. She obtained two
masters' degrees and a doctorate from
UC-Berkeley, and spent the 1983-84
school year as a visiting fellow at the
Hoover Institution. She now splits her
time equally between the two campuses.
With a career of some 15 years in Bay
Area health administration to her credit,
Marsh is in a unique position to serve the
center. "The center has never had a full
time academically trained person with
strong administration experience," she ex
plained. Taking advantage of her adminis
trative skills, Marsh said that her main in
terest will be in "program development

and administration research."
Marsh was raised in Oregon and
developed an interest in African politics
through her interest in contemporary poli
tical activism and her concern about
"society divided by race," she explained.
Today, one of her main focuses is promot
ing education for South African students.
Their education, Marsh emphasizes,
should be a commitment of both Stanford
and Berkeley, as institutions with moral,
as well as academic, missions. Such train
ing would constitute a constructive contri
bution to the amelioration of the South
Africa situation, she said. "Berkeley and
Stanford have not demonstrated that com
mitment," she added.
Marsh said she sees the main goals of
the center as strengthening African lan
guage instruction, establishing a strong re
search unit, working with established aca
demic programs to expand the African
studies curriculum, and planning activities
to bring together faculty and students on
both campuses. Marsh is currently plan
ning the Annual Joint Center Conference,
which will take place May 3 at Berkeley.
Another main mission of the center,
Marsh said, is to "expose the Bay Area to
Africa thought." She has been involved in
furthering this goal through her member
ship in the Africa Resource Center in
Oakland, and as the founder of the South
Africa Women's Fund, which "gives ma
terial support to women's projects in
South Africa," she said.

The center will play an important role,
according to Marsh, in encouraging
African students to study their own cul
ture and politics. "Africanists tend to be
European or white American scholars,"
she said, adding, "They have dominated
the area" in the past years.
Marsh said she believes that more
native Africans are involved in studying
their own countries and "evolving African
models of analysis." Their studies are be
coming "less based on Western models,"
she said.
Her interest in Africa area studies and
African politics has taken her to South
Africa to conduct field research in prepa
ration for her forthcoming book,
"Antagonistic Partnership: South African
Industry and African Labor 1868-82." In
addition, she has also published a number
of articles in various scholarly journals.
Marsh, who is involved in the anti
apartheid movement in Berkeley, empha
sized the value of student protest in raising
public consciousness, but warned students
not to be "myopic."
"Students should see activism as a part
of national anti-apartheid activism," she
said, adding that this activism is a part of a
growing international anti-apartheid
sentiment.
"The only thing the South African gov
ernment has responded to is international
pressure," she said. "Student activism is
very important (in helping) to bring the
crisis to focus in South Africa."
