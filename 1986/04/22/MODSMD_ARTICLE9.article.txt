# Affirmative action defended

### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
" Affirmative action is the only way to open up society,"
a prominent Bay Area civil rights lawyer told students
yesterday morning.
"But I don t know that if I were a white male I'd sup
port it. ... I'm a black woman. I have a very different take
on this."
The lawyer, Eva Paterson, offered her analysis of af
firmative action in a guest lecture to 200 students in a po
litical science class. "Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in the
United States," a new undergraduate course, is taught by
James Steyer.
Paterson, assistant director of the San Francisco
Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs, asserted that
goals and timetables for hiring are necessary for a society
in which "the pie should be distributed more fairly."
"White men have it a lot easier in our society than
people of color and women. That's just the way it is. And
all we're saying is, 'Give us a piece of the pie.' "
She also said the "next battle for people of color" is to
move up the company ladder once hired — to gain posi
tions of leadership and earn tenure.
She said the battle is made more difficult by
"superstars" whom people see as having overcome the
handicap of being a minority. "I call this the Diana Ross

syndrome," she said. "The fact that there are a few super
stars is great, but it's important not to generalize."
Paterson invoked former President Lyndon Johnson's
analogy of a foot race in which some runners have been
racing unfettered while others have been slowed by
weights chained to their ankles. By the time the weights
are removed, those who were chained have fallen far be
hind and deserve a chance to get back into the race.
" A few of you white men are going to have to sit down"
to let others catch up, she said.
In addition to the legacy of de jure discrimination in the
United States, people of color today must fight pervasive
racism, she said. She made a distinction between the ac
tive racism of whites who feel blacks are genetically in
ferior, and the subtle racism of whites who simply feel
more comfortable when surrounded by other whites.
But she emphasized that both kinds of racism translate
into unfair treatment of minorities, and asserted that af
firmative action can "blow the system over" in a benefi
cial way.
Affirmative action leads to outreach programs designed
to find qualified minorities, she noted, adding that the
goal is not to hire unqualified minorities over qualified
whites. "I don't see affirmative action as getting un
qualified people in jobs," she said. "What could be worse
for people of color?"
