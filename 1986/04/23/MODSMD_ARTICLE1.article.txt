# IFC revokes DU recognition for 2 years
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council (IFC) last night revoked
recognition of the Delta Upsilon fraternity for at least two
years and recommended the University do the same.
It the University ends its recognition of the DUs, the
fraternity would be disbanded and dehoused, IFC Presi
dent Don Galles told The Daily last night. In addition, the
DUs would not be able to hold any fraternity functions on
campus.
Galles said he felt the University would accept the IFC
recommendation and revoke recognition of the DUs.
In a letter to DU President Scott Hartman, members of
the IFC Review Board, the judicial body of the IFC,
wrote that the IFC had decided to revoke recognition of
the DUs for two years. After this period, the fraternity
could petition to regain IFC recognition under probation
ary status for six months, at which time the IFC would
vote whether to reinstate full recognition to the fraternity.
The University will decide what action to take against
the DUs after it reviews the IFC report, according to

Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano.
The IFC decision came exactly one week after the Uni
versity banned all Rush and other social activities at the
DUs. In a letter to Hartman, Pisano wrote that the restric
tions would remain in effect pending a University inquiry
into a number of incidents involving the fraternity.
The board cited an April 12 incident in which a burning
couch was thrown off a third floor balcony of the DU
house as an indication of the deeper problems facing the
DUs.
In that incident, two members of the DU house dragged
a couch to the third floor balcony. Despite instructions
from Hartman to stop, one of the two lit the couch on fire
and threw it off the balcony. Pisano told The Daily last
week that while there was no damage to the house, the
police had to be called to the scene. Hartman said last
Wednesday that the individual responsible for the act had
been disassociated from the fraternity.
The incident "highlights the control exercised by the
Delta Upsilon house government," members of the board
wrote Hartman in the letter, which was delivered to the
DU house last night.

The letter further stated that members of Delta Upsilon
have displayed "severe negligence" in house functions.
The board wrote that the presence of "bad elements" in
the house indicates that the DUs are "a threat to the
reputation and the existence to the present Greek system.
Delta Upsilon is bent on self-destruction."
Galles called the IFC decision "fair and right for the
fraternity system." However, he stressed that the recom
mendation was not based "on what the IFC thought the
University wanted to hear."
In revoking its recognition of the DUs, the IFC did not
consider either the David Curry incident or charges that
the DUs served alcohol to rushees after the hours
mandated by the IFC, Galles said.
Curry, a freshman, suffered two broken ribs and a col
lapsed lung in a fight with freshmen Randy Von Feldt and
Bill McKelvy near the DU house shortly before 3 a.m.
April 11. Earlier that night, the three had attended frater
nity Rush parties. Curry had to be rushed to Stanford
Hospital that morning.
Galles said that since the IFC did not see the police
report on the incident, it would be "inappropriate" to

blame the DUs for the altercation.
In his letter to the DUs, Pisano wrote that the DUs had
served alcohol to rushees after the 10:31) p.m. curfew
imposed by the IFC. Hartman told The Daily last week
that although he closed the bar down at 10:30 p.m., a keg
of beer "intended for house members only" remained in
the room of a fraternity member. Hartman said some
rushees had been served alcohol.
However, Galles said no conclusive statement verifying
that the DUs served rushees alcohol after 10:30 p.m.
could be obtained.
According to Galles, the DUs can appeal the IPC deci
sion. To obtain another hearing with the IFC Review
Board, the DUs would have to convince him that there
existed information the IFC overlooked in revoking
recognition of the fraternity or that the IFC decision was
unfair, Galles said. If an appeal were warranted, Galles
said he would ask the IFC to launch another investigation.
Galles said the board, which consists of six voting mem
bers, spent a week gathering information on the incidents
