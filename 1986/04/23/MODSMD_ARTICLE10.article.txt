# Egyptian raps U.S. policy in Mideast

### ROBERT REID 
Terrorism is not the crucial issue in the Middle
East, a former Egyptian government official said
here yesterday.
Tahseem Basheer, a former head spokesman for
the Egyptian government and a negotiator in the
1977 Camp David Peace Accords between Egypt
and Israel, told a Bechtel International Center au
dience of about 60 yesterday,"The real issue in the
Middle East is simply this. . . . Can the Arabs and
the Israelis make peace?"
"If, somehow, there can be peace between the
Palestinians and the Israelis, then those who are in
the Middle East can deal with other questions . . .
much more effectively and much more creatively,"
he said.
An adviser on the United States to Egyptian
Presidents Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak, Ba
sheer is a former Egyptian ambassador to Canada.
He also served in the Egyptian delegation to the
United Nations and was a permanent representa
tive to the League of Arab States.
Basheer said the United States is preoccupied
with Libya and terrorism to the exclusion of dealing
with the "meatier issues" of the Middle East, par
ticulary the ongoing conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians.
Egypt is trying to bring about peace between Is
rael and the Arab world, Basheer said, but "we
need America to act with us. . . . The issue of ter
rorism will be pushed to the sideline if we can ad
dress ourselves to the basic issue and make peace
politically possible."

The time has never been better to bring about
such a peace, Basheer said. "The peace con
stituency in the Middle East has grown stronger
than ever. The majority of Arabs want peace with
Israel, and the majority of Israelis want peace with
the Arabs.
"[But] while you find stronger support for peace
in the political arena, the extremists hold sway.
They have the power to veto . . . and so we are
losing a tremendous opportunity," Basheer said.
Basheer addressed the issue of the Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank and the Gaza strip. "It's a
fact that Israel militarily can continue to occupy the
West Bank and Gaza for some unlimited time. But
if it does that militarily, it will defeat itself politi
cally, because then Israel will be a multinational,
multireligious, multilingual country."
Basheer said that if the Israeli occupation per
sists, it could lead to even larger long-term prob
lems and to "the possible erosion of peace with
Egypt."
"Israel cannot live forever depending on unique
support from the United States. It would become
alienated; it would become, in effect, part of the
United States. And it would become a warring
country which could not have peace with its neigh
bors," he said.
Basheer said he was concerned that "extremists"
within Israel are in a position to push the country to
"a policy of no return" despite the dangerous na
ture of the situation.
According to Basheer, Israel's attitude toward
the Palestinians is ironic in light of its own history.

"For 30 years, Egypt wished that Israel did not ex
ist as an independent state. And. ironically enough,
now we find the Israelis are wishing that the Pales
tinians did not exist. Somehow, each repeats the
bad habits of others. It all proves that we are
human."
Basheer briefly addressed the issue of last week's
U.S. raid on Libya. "America talks about (Libyan
leader Col. Moammar) Khadafy as if there's an im
minent danger of him taking over Washington,
D.C.," he said.
Basheer added that the Egyptian method of
dealing with Khadafy is more effective than that of
the United States.
According to Basheer, Khadafy used to
"irritate" Egypt by periodically "sending people
over the border" until "Sadat sent him a small,
quick, surgical operation and gave him a little
thrashing, and since then he's calmed down. We
didn't publicize it, we didn't put him in the spot
light, we didn't give him propaganda, we just told
him if he did not behave, we would penalize him."
In an interview following his speech, Basheer
discussed the recent rioting in Cairo. He said the
riots, which he said involved only conscripts in the
Egyptian internal security forces, showed that the
Egyptian government enjoys a wide base of sup
port.
"The riots were a very important test of what the
public wants. If the public, during the curfew, had
decided to join the rioters, nothing could have
stopped them. No army, no police, nothing. . . . But
the moderation of the public succeeded," he said.

the Israelis make peace?"
"If, somehow, there can be peace between the
Palestinians and the Israelis, then those who are in
the Middle East can deal with other questions . . .
much more effectively and much more creatively,"
he said.
An adviser on the United States to Egyptian
Presidents Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak, Ba
sheer is a former Egyptian ambassador to Canada.
He also served in the Egyptian delegation to the
United Nations and was a permanent representa
tive to the League of Arab States.
Basheer said the United States is preoccupied
with Libya and terrorism to the exclusion of dealing
with the "meatier issues" of the Middle East, par
ticulary the ongoing conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians.
Egypt is trying to bring about peace between Is
rael and the Arab world, Basheer said, but "we
need America to act with us. . . . The issue of ter
rorism will be pushed to the sideline if we can ad
dress ourselves to the basic issue and make peace
politically possible."

The time has never been better to bring about
such a peace, Basheer said. "The peace con
stituency in the Middle East has grown stronger
than ever. The majority of Arabs want peace with
Israel, and the majority of Israelis want peace with
the Arabs.
"[But] while you find stronger support for peace
in the political arena, the extremists hold sway.
They have the power to veto . . . and so we are
losing a tremendous opportunity," Basheer said.
Basheer addressed the issue of the Israeli occu
pation of the West Bank and the Gaza strip. "It's a
fact that Israel militarily can continue to occupy the
West Bank and Gaza for some unlimited time. But
if it does that militarily, it will defeat itself politi
cally, because then Israel will be a multinational,
multireligious, multilingual country."
Basheer said that if the Israeli occupation per
sists, it could lead to even larger long-term prob
lems and to "the possible erosion of peace with
Egypt."
"Israel cannot live forever depending on unique
support from the United States. It would become
alienated; it would become, in effect, part of the
United States. And it would become a warring
country which could not have peace with its neigh
bors," he said.
Basheer said he was concerned that "extremists"
within Israel are in a position to push the country to
"a policy of no return" despite the dangerous na
ture of the situation.
According to Basheer, Israel's attitude toward
the Palestinians is ironic in light of its own history.

"For 30 years, Egypt wished that Israel did not ex
ist as an independent state. And. ironically enough,
now we find the Israelis are wishing that the Pales
tinians did not exist. Somehow, each repeats the
bad habits of others. It all proves that we are
human."
Basheer briefly addressed the issue of last week's
U.S. raid on Libya. "America talks about (Libyan
leader Col. Moammar) Khadafy as if there's an im
minent danger of him taking over Washington,
D.C.," he said.
Basheer added that the Egyptian method of
dealing with Khadafy is more effective than that of
the United States.
According to Basheer, Khadafy used to
"irritate" Egypt by periodically "sending people
over the border" until "Sadat sent him a small,
quick, surgical operation and gave him a little
thrashing, and since then he's calmed down. We
didn't publicize it, we didn't put him in the spot
light, we didn't give him propaganda, we just told
him if he did not behave, we would penalize him."
In an interview following his speech, Basheer
discussed the recent rioting in Cairo. He said the
riots, which he said involved only conscripts in the
Egyptian internal security forces, showed that the
Egyptian government enjoys a wide base of sup
port.
"The riots were a very important test of what the
public wants. If the public, during the curfew, had
decided to join the rioters, nothing could have
stopped them. No army, no police, nothing. . . . But
the moderation of the public succeeded," he said.
