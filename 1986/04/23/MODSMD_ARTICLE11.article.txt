Abortion, as we are all aware, is a very controversial
issue and one deeply charged with emotional, moral
and theological perspectives.
The question of abortion centers on much more than
the definition of when a life begins. Of equal impor
tance are the considerations of the quality of life a new
human being might expect to "enjoy," the circum
stances surrounding the pregnancy and the beliefs and
wishes of the mother and father.
In effect, there are no set circumstances which
dictate whether or not an abortion should be carried
out. But the right of a woman to choose whether or not
to have an abortion is something that should never be
taken away. That is why the pro-choice solution is the
most logical and humane answer to the abortion
debate.
It is not fair to label a doctor who commits an abor
tion, or the mother who has one, as a murderer. In
many cases, the birth of an unwanted child can be more
inhumane than the supposed "murder" of it through
an abortion. It is justifiably the right of a woman not to
have a child if her pregnancy is the result of a failed
form of birth control, or even worse, of a rape or some
other sexual abuse â€” though these are, by no means,
the only situations where an abortion is justifiable.
An abortion is certainly not a pleasant thing to con
sider, much less to undergo. In arguing for the right to
choose, we are not maintaining that abortion is the so
lution to unwanted pregnancies. Abortion should not

be considered as a method of birth control, but only as
an option of last resort. No one wants to see a rampant
rise in the number of abortions in society.
The key to avoiding the abortion dilemma, then, is
to increase the level of sex education in society and
make both men and women more aware of birth con
trol methods while decreasing the unjustified stigma of
getting an abortion.
The efforts of pro-choice activist Bill Baird, who
spoke here on April 10, to spread the message of abor
tion and contraception can only be highly commended.
The problem of abortion will not disappear by outlaw
ing it. It will only be reduced by the increased sexual
education of all individuals, especially the young.
Baird, the so-called "father of the abortion move
ment," has worked hard for many years to inform
people about contraception and abortion and to spread
his pro-choice crusade. To combat the problem of un
wanted pregnacies, the federal government should fol
low Baird's lead and spend more time and money to in
crease sexual education programs and awareness in our
schools.
It seems inconceivable and highy ironic that many of
those who are against abortions, and who call them
selves "pro-lifers," have taken to bombing abortion
clinics and harassing the patients and workers in them
in an increasingly violent fashion.
Such action is cruel and unproductive, and it must be
strongly condemned.
