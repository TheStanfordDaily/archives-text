Attack will spur
cycle of revenge
According to Isaac Winers logic
("Kudos to Reagan for Libya Strike,"
Daily, April 16), the governments of
Angola and Nicaragua would be fully
justified in bombing Washington,
D.C. Both of those governments have
called for the United States to stop its
support of terrorists in their
countries, and we have refused. The
Sandinistas have asked in vain for
negotiations with the Reagan Admin
istration. Fortunately, the
Nicaraguans and Angolans know that
even if they were capable of bombing
Washington it would only strengthen
U.S. resolve. A bombing attack — in
itself a form of terrorism when
civilians are hit — will not stop ter
rorism, and no one in the Reagan Ad
ministration expects it to. It will only
make popular heroes of Khadafy and
Reagan in their respective parts of
the world and assure a continuing
cycle of revenge and retaliation. The
attack on Libya will also strain rela
tions with our European allies and
dangerously increase tensions be
tween the United States and the So
viet Union. At the same time, judging
by the reaction in Congress, we can
probably expect an increase in the
already bloated U.S. military budget,
with its consequent burden on the
economy.
Escalating the violence in an area
that is already a tinder box waiting to
explode could prove a disaster. The
only way to reduce terrorism is to
seek ways of resolving the long
smoldering grievances that haunt the
Middle East, and take the necessary
steps to achieve a just peace between
Israel and the Palestinians. Killing

babies in the streets of Tripoli isn't
the way to do it.

Odd implications
in priests' letter
I read the letter from the Campus
Ministry in The Daily (April 15) ad
vocating a "Yes" vote on the referen
dum for stock divestment. Two of the
seven people signing the letter were
Catholic priests from the Newman
Center. There are several points
which need to be looked at.
The first point is that the letter
implies that the whites in South
Africa are unreformable and won't
change unless forced to change. It is
strange to find the implication that
people are unreformable in a letter
signed by two Catholic priests. If they
believe that people are unreformable,
then why do they conduct reconcilia
tion services here at Stanford?
The other point is that the reason
given in the letter for the unrefor
mability is that of economics. This is
very close to the Marxist theory that
the history of mankind is determined
by economic evolution. Surely two
Catholic priests would understand
that the moral sense and the free will
are autonomous from economics or
anything else.
The letter contains views similar to
those put forward by Alex La Buma
or Liver Tambo, whose writings are
available in communist bookstores,
or to the views of Jack Barnes put
forward in The New International.
These writers suggest that reform is
impossible, and they advocate divest
ment. However, it is clear from their

writings that they expect divestment
to serve as a catalyst for violent revo
lution. In light of this, can divestment
really be considered as part of a
"non-violent strategy"? The African
National Congress (ANC) doesn't
talk about reconciliation. Its mem
bers believe in "re-education" as
stated in their Freedom Charter:
"Imprisonment is for serious crimes
against the people, and shall aim at
re-education ..." We all know the
re-education story. We have seen it
before in Cambodia and in other very
sad situations.
The priests here in the Newman
Center should concern themselves
with the ministry of reconciliations
Pope John Paul II has suggested even
"giving it priority over other activi
ties" (Holy Thursday letter to priests,
1986).
