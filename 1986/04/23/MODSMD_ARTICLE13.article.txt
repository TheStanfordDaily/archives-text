# How to curb 'Mad Dog'

"He's left me with no choice. I'm afraid I have to kick
his ass and teach him a lesson."
"You can't do it, Dutch, it will ruin everything. We've
finally established a truce with the Grizzlies and you're
willing to jeopardize everything over some punk kid. Let
it go. You're twice his size."
"Look, Pierre, I have tried talking to him and he refuses
to listen. He picked a fight with my little brother and
threw my sister's ice cream cone on the ground. He's ter
rorized every little kid in the neighborhood. Helmut, he
pushed your sister into a ditch. Doesn't that piss you off?"
"Well, sure it does, but I'm used to it. My brother beats
up on my sister every day. Besides, I'm afraid that if I seek
revenge on Mad Dog, the Grizzlies will tear me apart."

"Gimme a break. The Grizzlies know as well as we do
that Mad Dog is a cowardly wimp who needs his attitude
adjusted. Boris and Mad Dog hate each other's guts. The
Grizzlies only tolerate him because he does them favors
and supports their gang in that neighborhood. The
Grizzlies might be a little upset if we pound Mad Dog to a
pulp, but they won't retaliate. The Grizzlies don't want a
gang war any more than we do. How about it, Alfredo,
let's teach him a lesson."
"I don't think so, Dutch. Mad Dog is pretty stubborn. If
we stomp Ijim, he will only behave worse. Rather than just
pushing your little sister, he will throw rocks and maybe
hit her with'? iKis'neipiHorhood. We"
understand Mad Dog better than you. Hans, Pierre,
Farnsworth and I have more experience with Mad Dog's
behavior and we feel violence will only provoke him fur
ther."
"Hell, maybe you're right, but we need to do some
thing. We can't let him push everybody around without
penalty. Hosni, you live right next door to Mad Dog. Let's
wait for him to leave for school and jump him together. I
don't want to hurt him bad â€” just bloody his nose a little
so he learns."
"I'm sorry, Dutch, I can't help you. I am already un
popular enough in that neighborhood, especially since I
befriended Lenny Rubinowitz who nobody else can stand.
After we trounce Mad Dog, you can go back to your own
block. I still have to live with these people."
"Okay, okay. I have a suggestion. I'll refrain from rear
ranging his face this time as long as we do something that
will convince Mad Dog to stop. Let's throw him off the
baseball team. How about it, Helmut?"
"Cmom, Dutch, Mad Dog is the best shortstop in the
league. We need him for the championship. If we throw
him off, he'll just play for somebody else. We'd only be
hurting ourselves."
"Pierre? Helmut? Alfredo? Farnsworth? If you are all
such experts, what do you suggest? Do you at least agree
that Mad Dog's conduct is unacceptable?"
"Yes." "Yes." "Yes." "Yes."
"Do you agree that as the biggest kids on the block and

members of the Screaming Eagles, the fiercest gang to
ever roam these streets, we have an obligation to stop
Mad Dog and his evil ways?"
"Yes." "Yes." "Yes." "Yes."
"Well what do you suggest? You have refused to
cooperate with any of my schemes. What do vou want to
do?"
"We wont sit next to him on the bench during the
baseball games."
"Good idea, Helmut, and if he runs for class president,
we won't vote for him."
"Yeah, Pierre, and if he makes a joke, we won't laugh."
"Right on, Farnsworth, and we'll write that he loves
Bertha Humpelmeir on every wall from here to Tripoli.
You see, Dutch, there are plenty of things we can do that
do not involve beating up Mad Dog."
"The question, Alfredo, is whether your measly mini
scule measures will even inconvenience Mad Dog, let
alone convince him to stop. Hans, do you think your idea
will work?"
"Well, probably not, but our ideas certainly will not
have the same disastrous consequences as yours. Besides,
your methods will offend the Grizzlies who outnumber us
despite our obviously superior strength, noble goals and
good looks."
"Again, Helmut is right, Dutch. We formed a gang for
our mutual protection against the Grizzlies. The alliance
should not be used to avenge every punk kid who you
think needs to be taught a lesson. By involving us, you are
unreasonably straining our friendship."
"Look, Dutch, Pierre has a good point. Perhaps you
should personally escort your sister and brother to school.
Mad Dog would not dare pick on them when you are
around."
"You guys really disappoint me. Why should I have to
escort my family everywhere to insure their protection?
They should be allowed to roam where they
out fear. At least you all try to look after the younger kids
wTien'They'afe"Tiear your hOllSfi, even though tfteTSSTTfici
dent did occur in your front yard, Helmut. Aristotle
remains the worst. He doesn't seem to care. Little kids get
picked on in his yard all the time."
"We would like to help, Dutch, but your ideas are too
risky."
"I disagree. I feel we must do something. Any effort
would be most effective if we acted as a gang, but you all
seem unwilling to do anything. If I have to act alone, I
will. Unfortunately, if I am by myself, the only option is to
beat him to a pulp."
"We have to go, Dutch. We hope you will reconsider."
"Okay, see ya later. Yeah, Farnsworth, what do you
want?"
"Don't tell the others, Dutch, but I think I can help.
The best time to jump Mad Dog is after school. Since I
live near the school, you can watch from my living room
window and attack him when he leaves the building. It's
the best I can offer."
"Thanks Farnsworth, I appreciate it."
What should Dutch do? Should he beat up Mad Dog
and risk further violence to his family, the alienation of his
gang members and worsened relations with the Grizzlies?
Or should he do nothing along with his fellow gang mem
bers, further disappoint his family who count on him for
protection and ignore the dictates of his conscience? What
would you do in his place?
