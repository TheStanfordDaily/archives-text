## Activists battle for a better world 
### 
As a progressive activist, it always amazes me
that students at Stanford feel obligated to analyze
and attack activists whom they have never met. I
opened up The Daily Monday morning (April 21)
to find two viewpoints. Jim Corl and Bob Abbot's
("Shantytown is not helping any blacks") and
Sreenivasan Iyer's ("ASSU needs new electoral
system"), questioning the sincerity of progressives

No activist that I know has ever seen them at a
meeting, and yet these people smugly categorize
progressive activists on this campus as "jumping on
the bandwagon." a familiar accusation. I am
writing in order to clear up any confusion that
people have about our motivations and our actions,
and to ask why those who don't act feel compelled
to criticize those who do.
After calling the candidates who supported the
People's Platform "left-wing toadies." Iyer claims
that we "are jumping on the college-activist band
wagon" and asks how many of us have even taken
the time to think about the issues. He finds it a
strange coincidence that we all share the same
views.
her should have askcJ us how we came up with
the platform if he was so curious. It took us weeks
of meetings. But the value of the People's Platform
is that it comes from a variety of progressive and
Third World organizations. People who drew up
the platform have committed time, that they could
have spent partying or studying, trying to change

this University. The planks of the platform come
from our struggles, and the candidates who support
the platform are also products of these struggles.
Every one of us has thought through and fought for
these issues, and has sacrificed in order to do so. If
Iyer took the time to talk to any of us, he would
know that.
Corl and Abbot object to the shantytown and the
sanctuary graveyard, and ask what the supposedly
committed SOSA members were all doing before
the weather turned nice. Why weren't they sitting
in front of the shantytown? The answer is simple.
We were planning events, writing and distributing
literature, circulating a petition, doing dorm educa
tions, going through trials for the arrests last spring
and raising money for the liberation movement in
South Africa. Corl and Abbot decry SOSA's use of

on the sidelines making . . . snide accusations.

the shantytown. but assume that when the shan
ty town isn't in White Plaza, nobody is fighting for
divestment.
But Corl and Abbot really cross the line of
reasonable criticism. They go so far as to suggest
that SOSA set fire to the shantytown in order to
gain publicity. This reflects an arrogant attitude, and
it is obvious the authors have absolutely no under
standing of the people they speak about. Perhaps
they should meet some of these people, and see

their commitment. SOSA is not a group of
publicity-hungry opportunists striving for any pos
sible mention of its names in The Daily; we have
been fighting a difficult battle for divestment since
last spring. We aren't perfect, but we are commit
ted to fighting for what we believe in.
You see, what bothers me so much about these
articles is that they reflect a tendency to use
criticism as an excuse for inaction. We are all out
there trying to make a difference. We may mess up
sometimes and use an inappropriate tactic, but we
are doing our best.
We want to support oppressed people all over,
from South Africa to Central America to the
United States. If you agree with our goals, help us
out. Don't stand on the sidelines making over
simplified, snide accusations. Come to a meeting

and give us your ideas. Or start up your own group
of people to work on these issues.
After all, what will really help the people of the
world? Sitting in your room writing letters to The
Daily attacking the small number of students who
are trying to improve this world? Or acting on your
convictions and doing something to change things?
