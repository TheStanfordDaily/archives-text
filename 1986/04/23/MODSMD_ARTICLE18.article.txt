## Lifeguarding at Lake Lagunita: it's a beach 
### WILMA LEE 
Ordinarily, one doesn't think of a
lifeguard's job as too strenuous, espe
cially at Lake Lagunita. Its waves are
hardly tidal, its swimmers are hardly
numerous. Generally, there just isn't
much life to guard.
But according to some student
lifeguards and the Boathouse
managers at the Lake, their jobs carry
a lot of responsibility, even if not
many students take advantage of
Lagunita's diverse offerings.
The lifeguards, who work at Lake
Lag and the Boathouse from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. on weekends, are Stanford stu
dents with certifications in advanced
life saving or Water Safety Instruc
tion (WSI).
And their jobs aren't all sun and
fun. According to freshman Joshua
Lipp, a lifeguard at Lag, "[Being a
lifeguard at the Lake] has a lot more
responsibility than a regular hashing
or library job. Sometimes the Lake is
totally filled with rafts, sailboats and
swimmers as well as all the people
laying out on the beach, so you really
have to keep your eyes open."
The lifeguards are not the only stu
dents who work at the Lake,
however. Annually, two students live
in the Boathouse and oversee the
Lake's activities and operations.
This year they are junior Andy
Cohen, the Boathouse facilities
manager, and senior Dave Ligon,
safety director of the Lake.
Ligon and Cohen manage the
Boathouse for the ASSU, and in
return they get to live in the Boat
house for free during the school year.
The windows of their two-bedroom
apartment offer a beautiful view of
the Lake.
Despite such luxury, Cohen and
Ligon really do earn their keep. They
applied for their respective positions
in February of last year, and they
were chosen from a pool of 25 appli
cants.
While both are responsible for
maintenance, safety and security of
/the beach and Boathouse, Ligon is in
t charge of the hiring of the Lake's 25
t lifeguards and Cohen manages the

books. Ligon and Cohen both work
between 20 and 30 hours weekly,
they said.
Both started their duties last June.
The reason for starting so soon, they
said, is so that they can get a head
start toward planning and ordering
equipment for the Lake for spring.
Once spring quarter hits, their jobs
become very hectic. "There are
people knocking and calling from
early morning to late at night,"
Cohen said. "We stop people who
come late at night to swim, especially
skinny-dippers, and who try to break
into the sheds."

Cohen and Ligon said they have
made vast improvements and innova
tions at the Lake and on the Boat
house.
In addition to adding a new boat
dock, tons of new sand for the beach
and a new party area, they have
tightened rules and security to make
Lake Lag an area strictly for the Stan
ford community.
The main impetus for the new
rules, they said, was an incident that
took place earlier this year in which
several non-Stanford students were
creating a disturbance that caused
Ligon and Cohen to call the police.

Upon investigating the incident,
the police discovered a loaded hand
gun in the car of one of the trespas
sers.
This spring, in order to make the
Lake area more safe, Cohen and
Ligon have hired student security
guards.
According to senior Fred Lopez, a
Lake security guard, "Our basic job is
to let only Stanford students, faculty,
staff and other extended members of
the Stanford family in (the Lake
area)."
However, Lopez also emphasized
that the Lake has a lot to offer Stan
ford students. "Although all these
great improvements have been made,
people still don't [use the Lake]. I
think Stanford students should come
out here more often rather than sit
ting on Wilbur Field."

And the Lake offers more than just
a place to "bag some rays." The
Boathouse is the home of the Stan
ford Sailing Association, the kayak
ing club, windsurfer storage space
and rental services. It also has a party
area that can be rented any night of
the week for $50.
The Stanford Challenge, a mini
triathalon, and Rapp's Triathalon,
which will be held April 27 and May
4, respectively, are two upcoming
events on the Lake's calendar.
With all the events and services the
Lake offers, Cohen and Ligon are en
thusiastic about the weeks ahead.
"A lot of people go to De Guerre
to swim," Cohen said. "This place
really used to be a zoo, but we've
made a lot of improvements and hope
to see a lot more people out here this
spring."

To most students, Lake Lag is a place to sail or kayak, but to many students, it is a place to work. There are
about 25 lifeguards who work at the Lake, two who live in the boathouse and oversee the area, and countless
others who are T As for windsurfing or sailing classes. The Lake will probably dry up sometime in June,
potentially sending scores of jobless students in search of other forms of employment.

managers at the Lake, their jobs carry
a lot of responsibility, even if not
many students take advantage of
Lagunita's diverse offerings.
The lifeguards, who work at Lake
Lag and the Boathouse from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. on weekends, are Stanford stu
dents with certifications in advanced
life saving or Water Safety Instruc
tion (WSI).
And their jobs aren't all sun and
fun. According to freshman Joshua
Lipp, a lifeguard at Lag, "[Being a
lifeguard at the Lake] has a lot more
responsibility than a regular hashing
or library job. Sometimes the Lake is
totally filled with rafts, sailboats and
swimmers as well as all the people
laying out on the beach, so you really
have to keep your eyes open."
The lifeguards are not the only stu
dents who work at the Lake,
however. Annually, two students live
in the Boathouse and oversee the
Lake's activities and operations.
This year they are junior Andy
Cohen, the Boathouse facilities
manager, and senior Dave Ligon,
safety director of the Lake.
Ligon and Cohen manage the
Boathouse for the ASSU, and in
return they get to live in the Boat
house for free during the school year.
The windows of their two-bedroom
apartment offer a beautiful view of
the Lake.
Despite such luxury, Cohen and
Ligon really do earn their keep. They
applied for their respective positions
in February of last year, and they
were chosen from a pool of 25 appli
cants.
While both are responsible for
maintenance, safety and security of
/the beach and Boathouse, Ligon is in
t charge of the hiring of the Lake's 25
t lifeguards and Cohen manages the

books. Ligon and Cohen both work
between 20 and 30 hours weekly,
they said.
Both started their duties last June.
The reason for starting so soon, they
said, is so that they can get a head
start toward planning and ordering
equipment for the Lake for spring.
Once spring quarter hits, their jobs
become very hectic. "There are
people knocking and calling from
early morning to late at night,"
Cohen said. "We stop people who
come late at night to swim, especially
skinny-dippers, and who try to break
into the sheds."

Cohen and Ligon said they have
made vast improvements and innova
tions at the Lake and on the Boat
house.
In addition to adding a new boat
dock, tons of new sand for the beach
and a new party area, they have
tightened rules and security to make
Lake Lag an area strictly for the Stan
ford community.
The main impetus for the new
rules, they said, was an incident that
took place earlier this year in which
several non-Stanford students were
creating a disturbance that caused
Ligon and Cohen to call the police.

Upon investigating the incident,
the police discovered a loaded hand
gun in the car of one of the trespas
sers.
This spring, in order to make the
Lake area more safe, Cohen and
Ligon have hired student security
guards.
According to senior Fred Lopez, a
Lake security guard, "Our basic job is
to let only Stanford students, faculty,
staff and other extended members of
the Stanford family in (the Lake
area)."
However, Lopez also emphasized
that the Lake has a lot to offer Stan
ford students. "Although all these
great improvements have been made,
people still don't [use the Lake]. I
think Stanford students should come
out here more often rather than sit
ting on Wilbur Field."

And the Lake offers more than just
a place to "bag some rays." The
Boathouse is the home of the Stan
ford Sailing Association, the kayak
ing club, windsurfer storage space
and rental services. It also has a party
area that can be rented any night of
the week for $50.
The Stanford Challenge, a mini
triathalon, and Rapp's Triathalon,
which will be held April 27 and May
4, respectively, are two upcoming
events on the Lake's calendar.
With all the events and services the
Lake offers, Cohen and Ligon are en
thusiastic about the weeks ahead.
"A lot of people go to De Guerre
to swim," Cohen said. "This place
really used to be a zoo, but we've
made a lot of improvements and hope
to see a lot more people out here this
spring."

To most students, Lake Lag is a place to sail or kayak, but to many students, it is a place to work. There are
about 25 lifeguards who work at the Lake, two who live in the boathouse and oversee the area, and countless
others who are T As for windsurfing or sailing classes. The Lake will probably dry up sometime in June,
potentially sending scores of jobless students in search of other forms of employment.

Ordinarily, one doesn't think of a
lifeguard's job as too strenuous, espe
cially at Lake Lagunita. Its waves are
hardly tidal, its swimmers are hardly
numerous. Generally, there just isn't
much life to guard.
But according to some student
lifeguards and the Boathouse
managers at the Lake, their jobs carry
a lot of responsibility, even if not
