## Balloon artery treatment rises in popularity 
### LAIE CAINDEC 
A recently developed non-operative proce
dure, which has undergone much of its growth
at the Stanford University Medical Center,
could in the near future replace much of open
heart bypass surgery in the treatment of coro
nary artery disease, according to a Stanford
cardiologist.
This favored procedure would allow coro
nary artery disease patients to remain awake
while being treated, and it would cut the cur
rent recovery period from three months to
two days.
The procedure is called percutaneous trans
luminal coronary angioplasty, or more simply
angioplasty. Developed in Europe in the
1970s by a Zurich medical researcher named
Andres Greuntzig, angioplasty is a fairly new
medical technique.

(Dr. Stephen) Oes
terle estimated that
the number of patients
who are treated with
angioplasty has
reached 10 times the
number predicted.

According to Steven Heilbrunn, a visting
fellow in cardiology at the Medical Center,
Stanford has contributed significantly to the
development and success of angioplasty over
the past three years. Heilbrunn said the work
done at Stanford is a "part of the pioneering
effort" needed to perfect angioplasty.
Since its invention by Greuntzig, much of
angioplasty's perfection has taken place under
the scrutiny of Dr. Stephen Oesterle, an assis
tant professor of medicine and director of the
University Hospital's unit for coronary inter
vention.
Though angioplasty is relatively new to
modern medicine, Oesterle points out that
progress with the procedure is largely due to

technological advances. "We didn't get better
all of a sudden. The equipment for doing this
procedure has gone through three or four
generations of change. And now it is spectac
ular," Oesterle said.
In a recent University Hospital press
release, Oesterle estimated that the number
of patients who are treated with angioplasty
has reached 10 times the number predicted
since its first introduction nine years ago.
Although angioplasty has undergone great
improvements since its discovery, doctors are
still mystified by the exact cause of coronary
artery disease, a condition in which a patient's
arteries are clogged by atherosclerotic
plaques that form when mostly fats, choles
terol and calcium accumulate in the arteries.
Some of the risk factors associated with the
disease, Heilbrunn noted, are smoking, high
blood pressure, diabetes, high lipid count (or
obesity) and, in some cases, even heredity.
"If you had to make a list of 10 of the most
serious risk factors, the first eight would be
smoking," Oesterle said.
Both angioplasty and bypass surgery "are
for the relief of angina," pain due to insuffi
cient blood flow to the heart, Oesterle said.
Angina pectoris is a term used to describe
chest pain caused by oxygen debt in the heart.
It can usually be relieved by rest, according to
Heilbrunn.
So, although angioplasty and bypass sur
gery do alleviate the pain caused by coronary
artery disease, they are actually limited meth
ods since they only treat the symptoms of the
disease without actually curing the patient.
The procedure itself is performed on
patients with coronary artery disease, the
most common cause of heart attacks and ar
tery collapse. In angioplasty, a surgeon inserts
a catheter tube into an artery in the patient's
right leg and with the use of a fluoroscope (a
form of X-ray) maneuvers the tube into the
heart's main vessel, the aorta. An appropri
ately sized balloon is then pulled through the
tube and carefully positioned across the prob
lem area in the artery; there the balloon is in
flated and deflated repeatedly until the
plaque is sufficiently squashed into the wall of
the artery.
With bypass surgery, on the other hand, a
vein is removed from the leg and stitched into
the coronary artery to bypass the plaque.
Bypass involves major open heart surgery.
While also reducing discomfort to the pa
tient, angioplasty is also less costly than
bypass surgery. The cost of angioplasty can
sometimes be only one-fifth that of a bypass,
according to Heilbrunn, with angioplasty at

$5,000 and a bypass at $25,000.
Even though angioplasty costs less than
bypass surgery and reduces discomfort, there
are still some cases for which angioplasty will
be inappropriate and where bypass surgery
will have to be performed.
For patients whose arteries are geometri
cally incompatible to angioplasty, or whose
arteries are totally blocked by plaque, bypass
surgery is the better option. At Stanford,
though, Oesterle said that sometimes an
gioplasty is performed on patients that the

surgeons think are inoperable.
According to the Medical Center, Stanford
performs approximately 200 angioplasty pro
cedures and 500 coronary bypass operations
per year. Although these figures contradict
the current national 1-1 ratio of bypasses to
angioplasties, Oesterle explained that this is
because "so many complex difficult (bypass)
cases that nobody else wants to do" are
referred to Stanford.
After a patient undergoes angioplasty,
there is a 30 percent probability that stenosis.

closure of an artery, will occur within the first
year, and the patient will have to undergo an
gioplasty again.
Oesterle commented on the occurence of
death caused by angioplasty. "We have never
had a death in angioplasty at Stanford. But
there is a clear-cut chance of death, probably
around 1 percent," he said.
Since angioplasty has only been practiced
on a wide scale for five years or so, it is not yet
evident how successful it will be compared to
bypass surgery.

In angioplasty treatment, a tiny balloon is threaded through a
catheter — a hollow tube — into the coronary artery of the heart
(shown above). The balloon is positioned over the clog, an at-

herosclerotic plaque, and is repeatedly inflated and deflated to
squash the plaque into the wall of the artery. The medical center
has been a leading contributor to the success of angioplasty. t,
