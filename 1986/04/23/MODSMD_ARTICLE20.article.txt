"Wild Gratitude"
By Edward Hirsch
Knoff, 78 pp.
$7.95
Edward Hirsch is at heart a rhapsodist. The presiding
spirits of his second collection of poetry are alienated ar
tists, venerable elders and the inspired mad, whose gift
and plight alike lie in having tasted extremities of emo
tion and experience. Disconsolation and disillusionment
are the straw with which Hirsch would have us weave gold
skeins of redemptive praise. The book's epigraph is a stir
ring vow of W.H. Auden's that Hirsch virtually elevates to
an a rs poetica: "May I, composed like them/Of Eros and
of dust/Beleaguered by the same/Negation and
despair,/ Show an affirming flame."
Hirsch's most distinctive and commanding poems are
propelled by an insistent current of surrealism and synes
thesia. Though his language is rarely arcane, he can intox
icate the reader through arresting variations of pitch and
syntax and an exacting sense of pace. He is a poet of
phenomena far more than of incident, of states rather
than situations. Because these are poems of strenuous ap
preciation, even awe, Hirsch's departures from routine
naturalism are not a skeptical renunciation of the world of
the senses, but passionate acclamations of the sensual and
imaginative powers. Bewitched by cycles, by the shift of
seasons, by perilous weather, "Wild Gratitude" marshals
a procession of snowfalls, thunderstorms, starry nights
and autumn Hurries unfailingly charged with mystery and
complicity.
It is a tribute to Hirsch's facility and audacity that he
can so frankly sustain his raptures and so blithely equate
epiphany with out-of-the-body travel. Though laced with
ironies and a penchant for the burlesque, poem after
poem records the prospects and minor triumphs of un
abashed transcendence. Levitation, real and imagined,
abounds. In his 1981 collection, "For the Sleepwalkers,"
Hirsch proved to be an obsessive dramatist of the noctur
nal and the dreamscape; here nearly half the poems are
night or twilight discovery. This vision consummates in
the sprawling, vertiginous tableau of "The Night
Parade," where the entire American populace is con
ceived as a republic of somnabulists, insomniacs and
nighthawks, "veterans of sleep" who rally under the
"National Anthem of Night," and drowsy senators who
make sure that "the unanimous motion of sleep carries."
There is curiously effective pathos and mordant comedy
in this literal invocation of the collective unconsciousness,
a conceit that might have easily degenerated into the dis
ingenuous.
An ardent empathy with the exiled and the estranged
animates Hirsch's efforts to acquit the human condition of
malignant hopelessness. As if in answer to Ezra Pound's
dictum that the artist "bear true witness," Hirsch com
monly allows the lives of artists to speak for the harrowing
loneliness and haunting introspection that must be
overcome before any blessings are counted. The title
poem is an homage to the ecstatically deranged 18th cen
tury poet Christopher Smart, "locked away in the mad
house at St. Luke's/With his sad religious mania and his
wild gratitude." Smart's madness is depicted as a con
vulsive surfeit of compassion that impells him to rejoice
ceaselessly over such apparent mundanities as "splintered
London streets," "the clink of milk bottles" and "his
speckled cat, Jeoffrey."
"Three Journeys" entwines the storied asylum-break of
another institutionalized poet, John Clare, with the daily
itinerary of the narrator's neighborhood bag lady. Its last

lines are a typically shapely appeal to abiding grace and
implicit faith:
Tonight when I lie down in the dark in my own bed, I
want to remember that John Clare was so desperately
hungry after three days and nights without food that he fi
nally knelt down, as if in prayer, and ate the soft grass of
the earth, and thought it tasted like fresh bread, and judged
no one, not even himself and slept peacefully again, like a
child.
Hirsch's accounts of the divided self modulate between
searching earnestness and mannered satire. The less suc
cessful of these tend to succumb to the very solipsism they
mean to illuminate, and betray the fact the poet has

not wholly innoculated himself against sentimentality. But
the beguiling metaphysical parody, "Poor Angels," and
the mesmerizing exposure of the ravaged psyche,
"Sleepwatch," showcases Hirsch's proficiency at evoking
interior landscapes, subconscious texts and the reveries of
the disaffected spirit. Never the misanthrope, Hirsch al
most invariably grants reprieves to the heart and the
mind, no matter how benighted or duplicitous. Occasion
ally, such as in the declamatory frenzy of the opening
poem, "I Need Help," consolation is mined from the
sheer fertility of invention:
For all the insomniacs in the world I want to build a new
kind of machine for flying out of the body at night. This

will win pence prizes, I know it. But 1 can t do it myself;
I'm exhausted, I need help from the inventors.
Hirsch concludes the poem with the characteristic as
sertion: "I need their help to fly out of myself." Much of
"Wild Gratitude" harmonizes within this key of release
and transformation: blighted egos and weary bodies
mercifully confirming that the sum is greater than their
parts.
The natural world's prodigality and munificence are
never forgotten for very long in a Hirsch poem. The inter
vention of the elements is often envisioned as restoring us
fully, if fleetingly, to the earthly fold through involuntary
states of wonder. Hirsch usually describes these transports
in a whirl of jazzy animism:
Yes, like a conductor's expectant are about to lift toward
the chorus, or a juggler's plates defying gravity, or a
hundred fast balls fired at once and freezing in midair, the
stars startle the sky over the city.
Snow is nonpartisan; rain does not discriminate. And a
simple summer cloudburst can become an exultant tes
timonial to the rejuvenation of imaginative possibility:
The dead heat rises for weeks, / Unwanted, unasked for,
but suddenly, / Like the answer to a question, / A real sum
mer shower breaks loose in the middle of August. So
think / Of trumpets and cymbals, a young girl I In a spar
kling tinsel suit leading / A parade down Fifth Avenue, all /
The high school drummers in the city / Banging away at
once.
In this volume of four parts, the third is the most unified
and ambitious. The poems constellate around the wrench
ing trials of 20th century Eastern Europe, presumably
composing an extended meditation on the poet's ancestry.
Too often the impulse to venerate ethnic or cultural heri
tage produces insipid or exploitative snapshots-in-verse,
but Hirsch's poems are striking in their intelligence,
resonance and resistance to facile moralizing. The two
elegies to his grandparents, "Fever" and "Ancient Signs,"
are among the most moving in the book, containing
passages that obliquely but inescapably brood on the can
cerous legacy of the Holocaust:
My grandfather used to stand calmly by the open win
dow during storms. He said that he could see lightning
searching the empty rooftops, rifling the windows for his
body.
Heirs to ghostly traditions must rely on the persistence
of memory and the durability of cherishing to rescue
themselves from complete oblivion. Hirsch's devastated
and displaced Poles, Hungarians, Austrians and Russian
Jews cling with private ferocity to the resilient images of
their vanished lives. "The Village Idiot" plangently recalls
"a wild-eyed relic of the Old World" whose impression
remains indelible even though "he disappeared long ago,
like the village itself."
Memory in its most visceral and cathartic form occupies
"Leningrad (1941-1943):" Searing details of the siege of
Leningrad mount relentlessly for over 100 lines until the
speaker, ostensibly purged, utters the poem's only
redemptive words â€” "Somehow we lived."
Engaging a tragic past that could likely swamp a poet in
immigrant's early-morning reverie, "In a Polish Home for
the Aged," admirably achieves a tenderness and restraint
that is in itself intensely moral.
"Wild Gratitude" is a work of authentic originality and
unusual conviction. Hirsch manages to remain attentive to
his craft without resorting to the surgical coolness so
prevalent among his contemporaries. A second collection
of poems is invariably burdened by the expectation that it
will demonstrate a sound advancement of a poet's particu
lar gifts and a deepening of personal concerns. Always ca
pable of smooth performances, Hirsch emerges in this
volume as a voice of singular clarity and expressiveness.

"Wild Gratitude"
By Edward Hirsch
Knoff, 78 pp.
$7.95
Edward Hirsch is at heart a rhapsodist. The presiding
spirits of his second collection of poetry are alienated ar
tists, venerable elders and the inspired mad, whose gift
and plight alike lie in having tasted extremities of emo
tion and experience. Disconsolation and disillusionment
are the straw with which Hirsch would have us weave gold
skeins of redemptive praise. The book's epigraph is a stir
ring vow of W.H. Auden's that Hirsch virtually elevates to
an a rs poetica: "May I, composed like them/Of Eros and
of dust/Beleaguered by the same/Negation and
despair,/ Show an affirming flame."
Hirsch's most distinctive and commanding poems are
propelled by an insistent current of surrealism and synes
thesia. Though his language is rarely arcane, he can intox
icate the reader through arresting variations of pitch and
syntax and an exacting sense of pace. He is a poet of
phenomena far more than of incident, of states rather
than situations. Because these are poems of strenuous ap
preciation, even awe, Hirsch's departures from routine
naturalism are not a skeptical renunciation of the world of
the senses, but passionate acclamations of the sensual and
imaginative powers. Bewitched by cycles, by the shift of
seasons, by perilous weather, "Wild Gratitude" marshals
a procession of snowfalls, thunderstorms, starry nights
and autumn Hurries unfailingly charged with mystery and
complicity.
It is a tribute to Hirsch's facility and audacity that he
can so frankly sustain his raptures and so blithely equate
epiphany with out-of-the-body travel. Though laced with
ironies and a penchant for the burlesque, poem after
poem records the prospects and minor triumphs of un
abashed transcendence. Levitation, real and imagined,
abounds. In his 1981 collection, "For the Sleepwalkers,"
Hirsch proved to be an obsessive dramatist of the noctur
nal and the dreamscape; here nearly half the poems are
night or twilight discovery. This vision consummates in
the sprawling, vertiginous tableau of "The Night
Parade," where the entire American populace is con
ceived as a republic of somnabulists, insomniacs and
nighthawks, "veterans of sleep" who rally under the
"National Anthem of Night," and drowsy senators who
make sure that "the unanimous motion of sleep carries."
There is curiously effective pathos and mordant comedy
in this literal invocation of the collective unconsciousness,
a conceit that might have easily degenerated into the dis
ingenuous.
An ardent empathy with the exiled and the estranged
animates Hirsch's efforts to acquit the human condition of
malignant hopelessness. As if in answer to Ezra Pound's
dictum that the artist "bear true witness," Hirsch com
monly allows the lives of artists to speak for the harrowing
loneliness and haunting introspection that must be
overcome before any blessings are counted. The title
poem is an homage to the ecstatically deranged 18th cen
tury poet Christopher Smart, "locked away in the mad
house at St. Luke's/With his sad religious mania and his
wild gratitude." Smart's madness is depicted as a con
vulsive surfeit of compassion that impells him to rejoice
ceaselessly over such apparent mundanities as "splintered
London streets," "the clink of milk bottles" and "his
speckled cat, Jeoffrey."
"Three Journeys" entwines the storied asylum-break of
another institutionalized poet, John Clare, with the daily
itinerary of the narrator's neighborhood bag lady. Its last

lines are a typically shapely appeal to abiding grace and
implicit faith:
Tonight when I lie down in the dark in my own bed, I
want to remember that John Clare was so desperately
hungry after three days and nights without food that he fi
nally knelt down, as if in prayer, and ate the soft grass of
the earth, and thought it tasted like fresh bread, and judged
no one, not even himself and slept peacefully again, like a
child.
Hirsch's accounts of the divided self modulate between
searching earnestness and mannered satire. The less suc
cessful of these tend to succumb to the very solipsism they
mean to illuminate, and betray the fact the poet has

not wholly innoculated himself against sentimentality. But
the beguiling metaphysical parody, "Poor Angels," and
the mesmerizing exposure of the ravaged psyche,
"Sleepwatch," showcases Hirsch's proficiency at evoking
interior landscapes, subconscious texts and the reveries of
the disaffected spirit. Never the misanthrope, Hirsch al
most invariably grants reprieves to the heart and the
mind, no matter how benighted or duplicitous. Occasion
ally, such as in the declamatory frenzy of the opening
poem, "I Need Help," consolation is mined from the
sheer fertility of invention:
For all the insomniacs in the world I want to build a new
kind of machine for flying out of the body at night. This

will win pence prizes, I know it. But 1 can t do it myself;
I'm exhausted, I need help from the inventors.
Hirsch concludes the poem with the characteristic as
sertion: "I need their help to fly out of myself." Much of
"Wild Gratitude" harmonizes within this key of release
and transformation: blighted egos and weary bodies
mercifully confirming that the sum is greater than their
parts.
The natural world's prodigality and munificence are
never forgotten for very long in a Hirsch poem. The inter
vention of the elements is often envisioned as restoring us
fully, if fleetingly, to the earthly fold through involuntary
states of wonder. Hirsch usually describes these transports
in a whirl of jazzy animism:
Yes, like a conductor's expectant are about to lift toward
the chorus, or a juggler's plates defying gravity, or a
hundred fast balls fired at once and freezing in midair, the
stars startle the sky over the city.
Snow is nonpartisan; rain does not discriminate. And a
simple summer cloudburst can become an exultant tes
timonial to the rejuvenation of imaginative possibility:
The dead heat rises for weeks, / Unwanted, unasked for,
but suddenly, / Like the answer to a question, / A real sum
mer shower breaks loose in the middle of August. So
think / Of trumpets and cymbals, a young girl I In a spar
kling tinsel suit leading / A parade down Fifth Avenue, all /
The high school drummers in the city / Banging away at
once.
In this volume of four parts, the third is the most unified
and ambitious. The poems constellate around the wrench
ing trials of 20th century Eastern Europe, presumably
composing an extended meditation on the poet's ancestry.
Too often the impulse to venerate ethnic or cultural heri
tage produces insipid or exploitative snapshots-in-verse,
but Hirsch's poems are striking in their intelligence,
resonance and resistance to facile moralizing. The two
elegies to his grandparents, "Fever" and "Ancient Signs,"
are among the most moving in the book, containing
passages that obliquely but inescapably brood on the can
cerous legacy of the Holocaust:
My grandfather used to stand calmly by the open win
dow during storms. He said that he could see lightning
searching the empty rooftops, rifling the windows for his
body.

The natural world's prodigality and munificence are
never forgotten for very long in a Hirsch poem. The inter
vention of the elements is often envisioned as restoring us
fully, if fleetingly, to the earthly fold through involuntary
states of wonder. Hirsch usually describes these transports
in a whirl of jazzy animism:
Yes, like a conductor's expectant are about to lift toward
the chorus, or a juggler's plates defying gravity, or a
hundred fast balls fired at once and freezing in midair, the
stars startle the sky over the city.
Snow is nonpartisan; rain does not discriminate. And a
simple summer cloudburst can become an exultant tes
timonial to the rejuvenation of imaginative possibility:
The dead heat rises for weeks, / Unwanted, unasked for,
but suddenly, / Like the answer to a question, / A real sum
mer shower breaks loose in the middle of August. So
think / Of trumpets and cymbals, a young girl I In a spar
kling tinsel suit leading / A parade down Fifth Avenue, all /
The high school drummers in the city / Banging away at
once.
In this volume of four parts, the third is the most unified
and ambitious. The poems constellate around the wrench
ing trials of 20th century Eastern Europe, presumably
composing an extended meditation on the poet's ancestry.
Too often the impulse to venerate ethnic or cultural heri
tage produces insipid or exploitative snapshots-in-verse,
but Hirsch's poems are striking in their intelligence,
resonance and resistance to facile moralizing. The two
elegies to his grandparents, "Fever" and "Ancient Signs,"
are among the most moving in the book, containing
passages that obliquely but inescapably brood on the can
cerous legacy of the Holocaust:
My grandfather used to stand calmly by the open win
dow during storms. He said that he could see lightning
searching the empty rooftops, rifling the windows for his
body.
Heirs to ghostly traditions must rely on the persistence
of memory and the durability of cherishing to rescue
themselves from complete oblivion. Hirsch's devastated
and displaced Poles, Hungarians, Austrians and Russian
Jews cling with private ferocity to the resilient images of
their vanished lives. "The Village Idiot" plangently recalls
"a wild-eyed relic of the Old World" whose impression
remains indelible even though "he disappeared long ago,
like the village itself."
Memory in its most visceral and cathartic form occupies
"Leningrad (1941-1943):" Searing details of the siege of
Leningrad mount relentlessly for over 100 lines until the
speaker, ostensibly purged, utters the poem's only
redemptive words â€” "Somehow we lived."
Engaging a tragic past that could likely swamp a poet in
immigrant's early-morning reverie, "In a Polish Home for
the Aged," admirably achieves a tenderness and restraint
that is in itself intensely moral.
"Wild Gratitude" is a work of authentic originality and
unusual conviction. Hirsch manages to remain attentive to
his craft without resorting to the surgical coolness so
prevalent among his contemporaries. A second collection
of poems is invariably burdened by the expectation that it
will demonstrate a sound advancement of a poet's particu
lar gifts and a deepening of personal concerns. Always ca
pable of smooth performances, Hirsch emerges in this
volume as a voice of singular clarity and expressiveness.
