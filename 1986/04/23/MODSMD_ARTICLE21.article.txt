## Batsmen top Fresno in extra innings 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
The Fresno State Bulldogs should
have quit while they were tied.
After holding the No. 7 Stanford
baseball team at bay for nine innings,
the Bulldogs watched the Cardinal
explode for four runs in the top of the
10th to grab a 5-1 non-conference
victory last night at Beiden Field in
Fresno.
For Stanford, the win snapped a
two-game non-conference losing
streak and avenged an earlier 5-3 loss
to the Bulldogs this year. The Card
inal's season record moves to 29-15
with the victory, and Stanford now
rests in first place in the Pacific 10
Southern Division after sweeping a
doubleheader with UCLA on Mon
day. The loss dropped the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association Bulldogs'
record to 21-23-1 on the year.
It looked like Bulldog starter Bill
Bartels might be in for a long night
when Stanford's first batter of the
game, third baseman Ruben Amaro,
ripped his fourth home run to stake
the Cardinal to a quick lead. But after
that Bartels made like Mother Goose
and started putting eggs up on the
Stanford half of the scoreboard. The
Cardinal, showing fatigue after
playing five games in the preceding
four days, could manage only two hits
over the next eight innings.
Meanwhile, Stanford starter Steve
Chitren was taking the bite out of the
Bulldog bats. The freshman
righthander, 2-4 coming into the
game, made his finest showing of the
season, giving up only two hits and

one unearned run in seven innings.
The run came in the sixth, when
Amaro overthrew first base on Evan
Edwards' grounder to put Edwards
on second with two out. Steve Bates,
sporting a .466 batting average enter
ing the game, then singled sharply to
left to knot the game at 1-1.
Stanford's bats weren't showing
much life at that point, as Bartels
retired 13 consecutive Cardinal bat
ters, beginning with the last out in the
fifth and stretching through the sixth,
seventh, eighth and ninth frames.
But then the clock struck 10
(innings, that is), and Bartels' car
riage turned back into a pumpkin.
With one out in the 10th, designated
hitter Lance Shebelut (a native of
Fresno) started the Cardinal batting
barrage with a single.
Ken Green followed with another
single, and Frank Carey brought in
the go-ahead run with a double over
first base. Mark Machtolf scored
Green and Carey with a single and
advanced to second on the throw to
the plate. After Bartels was replaced
by Mike Goff, catcher John Ramos
finished Stanford's scoring by driving
in Machtolf with a single, the Card
inal's fifth straight hit.
Rob Wassenaar, who had replaced
Chitren in the eighth, muzzled the
Bulldogs in the bottom of the 10th to
secure the win and collect his fourth
victory of the year against one loss.
Bartels, who brought a 4.11 ERA
to the game but pitched much better
than that (at least through nine in
nings), absorbed the defeat, his second
of the season to go with one win.


Second baseman Ken Green's single to center kept Stanford's one-out
rally going in the top of the 10th inning at Fresno State yesterday. The

Kym Boy man/Daily file
Cardinal went on to score four runs in the top of the frame to beat the
Bulldogs 5-1.
