# Seniors took different roads to the top
## Braun and Root key tourney hopes 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
In a short ceremony before last
Saturday night's volleyball match
against USC, the graduating seniors
were each presented with a bottle of
champagne and roses. Two of the
play&Ki>!ihonored are both .All-
American candidates at outside hitter
for the Cardinal — Chris Braun and
Jon Root, the top hitters for the
squad this season.
The pair have little in common
other than their position and their
graduating status, however. Well,
okay, they're both tall, too. Braun is
6-foot-6, Root is 6-5. But that's
where the similarities end. In reality,
the two are worlds apart.
For starters, Braun and Root
arrived at Stanford in very different
situations — Root as one of the most
highly recruited players in the
country and Braun as a player with
great physical potential but little ac
tual experience.
"They were two very completely
different kinds of players," said Stan
ford Co-coach Fred Sturm, who along
with Don Shaw has coached both
seniors during their careers at Stan
ford. "Chris played a lot more bas
ketball, Jon more volleyball. Jon
came from a hotbed of volleyball, his
high school especially. He had a lot
more experience.
"Jon was the No. 1 recruit in the
nation — the best prospect that year
along with Troy Tanner (now at Pep
perdine). Braun was recruited more
on his capability than on his ability.
Jon was recruited on his ability."
"Jon was a more accomplished vol

leyball player," Shaw agreed. "Chris
hadn't had much experience, he was
pretty green. But his hitting has made
him develop into one of the most
feared hitters in the conference and
the country. That's quite a step."
"Root was one of the most highly
touted high school players in the
country," fellow sefiior a'nd team cap
tain Brett Monello said. "Chris Braun
was in the most pure sense an un
known quantity. He was tall and had
the physical skills, but he was raw."
Root was recruited by volleyball
powerhouses UCLA, USC, UC-
Santa Barbara and Pcpperdine, along
with Stanford, who, at the time, had
not had a winning season since 1977.
"I came here because of the loca
tion and because I thought that Stan
ford had a program I could help out a
lot," Root explained. "Also because
of the coaches and the academic
rigors, the intellectual challenge."
Braun was also recruited by UCLA
and USC for volleyball — and by
UC-Irvine and Oregon State for bas
ketball. "My dad taught me volleyball
when 1 was a junior in high school,"
Braun said. "1 just screwed around,
though. I only really played organized
volleyball here.
"I came here because of the all
around program that Stanford of
fers," he continued, "and the good
sporting tradition, and I didn't want
to go to school in L.A. And 1 knew
the coaches were good guys."
Root entered the starting lineup
immediately his freshman year.
"Until my senior year I never missed
a game of a match for any reason,"
said the senior who has been beset by
injuries this season. Braun, however,

was a different story.
"This is my second year starting."
Braun said. "I didn't play much
before, only sporadically. I'd go in in
the front row, then rotate out. My
playing time was limited.
"After my sophomore year, I
thought I wouldn't play my junior
year," he added. "It was frustrating. I
thought I wasn't getting the opportu
nity to improve. I thought I might
play basketball or another sport. I
decided I wouldn't play volleyball my
junior year.
"A lot of things changed my
mind," Braun continued. "For four
months 1 didn't even think about vol
leyball, 1 didn't play at all. I came
back to school, I was an RAin a
dorm, and I didn't think I'd have
enough time. Then (setter) Craig
Lauchner called me and said we'd
changed our offense and I would play
a lot.
"1 was skeptical. I had a negative
attitude after two years without
playing much. I came out three weeks
into the pre-season, and 1 got into
drills more and played more. 1 found
1 could balance my time as an RA,
too.
"In the Santa Barbara tournament
I started every game and I did pretty
well. The team was more confident
about me, and 1 had more confidence
in myself. Once you get your confi
dence up, you can play in this
league."
And the rest is Stanford history —
which Braun made when he recorded
an outstanding 49 kills against UCLA
earlier this season.
"That was clearly the most impres
sive hitting effort ever seen in Maples

Pavilion," Sturm said "That's what
can happen when Chris is in the flow
of things; he showed what he's capa
ble of doing. He had 10 kills in 10 hit
ting attempts in game two. What was
incredible is that UCLA is known as a
strong blocking team."
"Steve Modory was setting particu
larly well that night," Braun ex
plained." If you have a good set, it's
hard to screw up."
Braun leads the Cardinal into the
NCAA West Regional tomorrow
with 404 kills, tops on the team, and a
.313 hitting percentage, second
among the starters. He is considered
a strong candidate for Ail-American
honors. He was an honorable men
tion All-American last season when
he also led the Cardinal in kills (297)
as well as average (.322).
"When you improve as much as
Chris has," Sturm said,"it has a lot to
do with Chris Braun. It's a real trib
ute to him. You're only as good as
you work to become. He had to sit
down and think through his goals.
Once he was committed to volleyball,
we saw a change in Chris Braun."
"Chris is capable of much more in
the game of volleyball," Shaw said.

"It's just a question of putting his
mind to it."
Monello agreed. "Chris has not
reached his potential. He has an in
credible reach and jumping ability;
he's fairly agile. There's no block in
the league he can't hit over. He has
all the necessary physical talents. His
blocking is a long way from being as
good as it could be; with his physical
endowments, he could be the best
blocker in the league."
"I think people knew what they
were in for after the first few games
this season," Root said. "He's
progressed at such a steady level. This
is the culmination."
And what of All-American Root,
who toured with the U.S. National
Team last year? The senior has been
troubled with injuries, including a
severely sprained ankle and a sore
shoulder and missed four matches
this season, yet still is second in kills
and third among starters in
average (.282). Last year he led the
squad in digs, block solos and block
assists. Despite his injuries, he is

Sturm, "hasn't even come close to his potential. His improvement in a two-year span has
been phenomenal."
second in all of those categories this
year.
"Overall I'm pretty satisfied,"
Root said. "My hitting is a little bet
ter, and I've adjusted to the outside
hitter position (from middle blocker).
My injuries depressed me a little. I
feel I'm having a good year; I thought
I could have had an outstanding
year."
"In many ways Jon is playing better
than last year," Sturm said. "He's
more consistent. He's matured a lot
in things that can't be measured in
statistics — like leadership. He's a
great player, very complete, very ver
satile. He's the best all-around player
I've ever coached. Players like that
don't come by very often."
"It's definitely been frustrating for
Jon," Monello said." He has ambi
tions to play on the national team and
sees the entire year as a time to prove
something to the national coaches
and to the volleyball world. He's un
der a lot of pressure. He's kind of put
all his eggs in one basket. Playing on
the national team is extremely impor

tant to him.
"Jon puts a lot of pressure on him
self to perform; sometimes he expects
too much from himself. He's having a
very good year. At times he's showed
he's the best player in the CIVA."
Volleyball is very much a part of
Root's future plans. "Hopefully I'll
hear from the national team soon,
and I'll travel with them again. I'll
join after I get out of school. I'd like
to go to '88 (Olympics); then, if I'm
still interested and I make it that far,
maybe another two years.
"I don't know if I could take it to
'92. I think three or four years max.
I'd be 26 then; that's a good time to
start making a living," said Root, a
political science and economics major
from Marina Del Rey. "Nothing too
structured, though. The investment
banking, corporate world isn't
looking too good right now. I need
some free time, some creativity, to be
outdoors. I'm not going to get into
coaching."
Braun, on the other hand, is going
to get into coaching right away — as a
Stanford assistant coach next season.
The human biology major will be
back next year as an RA and will also
be the business manager for KZSU.

As if all that isn't enough, the
native of Carmichael has recently
started the Stanford Club for
Entrepreneurial Education, which
funds student buisness projects with
no interest loans and no risk, sending
all profits to charitable organizations.
Clearly, the two differ vastly off the
court. Braun is considering buisness
school; Root says,"l haven't totally
geared myself for the buisness aspect
of my life yet." While Root will prob
ably be with the national team next
year, Braun may play in Europe in
the future.
"Volleyball is not as much a part of
his life as mine right now," Root said.
"I've got more riding on this; I plan
to take it a little further."
"Jon has really concentrated on
volleyball," Braun said. "Volleyball
is important to me, but I've tried to
diversify and get the most out of
Stanford, enjoy all my opportuni
ties."
Just as the two have separate
ests, they are very different per
sonally. "They have such different
personalities, they are such different
people," Shaw said. "They're like
night and day. Jon is more outwardly
intense. They look at the game in a

different way."
"Jon says what he feels, Chris
shows how he feels," Sturm agreed.
"Chris is very quiet, while Jon is very
vocal and outspoken. Their roles are
very different. Chris is the team's hit
ter, and Jon is not only the hitter, he's
a passer, a server, a blocker. Chris
adds a lot with his hitting; Jon adds a
lot of other things as well."
"Jon is very emotional," Monello
said. "Sometimes he's a supercharged
ball of fun, sometimes he's moody
and introspective. Chris is stoic. Not
boring, but calm and steady. He
keeps it inside. Jon is prone to both.
Sometimes he'll yell and rage,
sometimes he'll sit and sulk."
"Chris is our designated hitter basi
cally," Shaw explained. "Jon does it
all for us. Chris' hitting is so
awesome, so amazing, that's what
stands out. Jon is important to have
out there for all sorts of things. Physi
cally he can do it all. They are both
looked to for different reasons."
"Our opponents follow both of
them around when they're in the
front row," Sturm said. "They're our
two big guns and that's a tribute to
them."

Team last year? The senior has been
troubled with injuries, including a
severely sprained ankle and a sore
shoulder and missed four matches
this season, yet still is second in kills
and third among starters in
average (.282). Last year he led the
squad in digs, block solos and block
assists. Despite his injuries, he is

been phenomenal."
second in all of those categories this
year.
"Overall I'm pretty satisfied,"
Root said. "My hitting is a little bet
ter, and I've adjusted to the outside
hitter position (from middle blocker).
My injuries depressed me a little. I
feel I'm having a good year; I thought
I could have had an outstanding
year."
"In many ways Jon is playing better
than last year," Sturm said. "He's
more consistent. He's matured a lot
in things that can't be measured in
statistics — like leadership. He's a
great player, very complete, very ver
satile. He's the best all-around player
I've ever coached. Players like that
don't come by very often."
"It's definitely been frustrating for
Jon," Monello said." He has ambi
tions to play on the national team and
sees the entire year as a time to prove
something to the national coaches
and to the volleyball world. He's un
der a lot of pressure. He's kind of put
all his eggs in one basket. Playing on
the national team is extremely impor

tant to him.
"Jon puts a lot of pressure on him
self to perform; sometimes he expects
too much from himself. He's having a
very good year. At times he's showed
he's the best player in the CIVA."
Volleyball is very much a part of
Root's future plans. "Hopefully I'll
hear from the national team soon,
and I'll travel with them again. I'll
join after I get out of school. I'd like
to go to '88 (Olympics); then, if I'm
still interested and I make it that far,
maybe another two years.
"I don't know if I could take it to
'92. I think three or four years max.
I'd be 26 then; that's a good time to
start making a living," said Root, a
political science and economics major
from Marina Del Rey. "Nothing too
structured, though. The investment
banking, corporate world isn't
looking too good right now. I need
some free time, some creativity, to be
outdoors. I'm not going to get into
coaching."
Braun, on the other hand, is going
to get into coaching right away — as a
Stanford assistant coach next season.
The human biology major will be
back next year as an RA and will also
be the business manager for KZSU.

As if all that isn't enough, the
native of Carmichael has recently
started the Stanford Club for
Entrepreneurial Education, which
funds student buisness projects with
no interest loans and no risk, sending
all profits to charitable organizations.
Clearly, the two differ vastly off the
court. Braun is considering buisness
school; Root says,"l haven't totally
geared myself for the buisness aspect
of my life yet." While Root will prob
ably be with the national team next
year, Braun may play in Europe in
the future.
"Volleyball is not as much a part of
his life as mine right now," Root said.
"I've got more riding on this; I plan
to take it a little further."
"Jon has really concentrated on
volleyball," Braun said. "Volleyball
is important to me, but I've tried to
diversify and get the most out of
Stanford, enjoy all my opportuni
ties."
Just as the two have separate
ests, they are very different per
sonally. "They have such different
personalities, they are such different
people," Shaw said. "They're like
night and day. Jon is more outwardly
intense. They look at the game in a

different way."
"Jon says what he feels, Chris
shows how he feels," Sturm agreed.
"Chris is very quiet, while Jon is very
vocal and outspoken. Their roles are
very different. Chris is the team's hit
ter, and Jon is not only the hitter, he's
a passer, a server, a blocker. Chris
adds a lot with his hitting; Jon adds a
lot of other things as well."
"Jon is very emotional," Monello
said. "Sometimes he's a supercharged
ball of fun, sometimes he's moody
and introspective. Chris is stoic. Not
boring, but calm and steady. He
keeps it inside. Jon is prone to both.
Sometimes he'll yell and rage,
sometimes he'll sit and sulk."
"Chris is our designated hitter basi
cally," Shaw explained. "Jon does it
all for us. Chris' hitting is so
awesome, so amazing, that's what
stands out. Jon is important to have
out there for all sorts of things. Physi
cally he can do it all. They are both
looked to for different reasons."
"Our opponents follow both of
them around when they're in the
front row," Sturm said. "They're our
two big guns and that's a tribute to
them."
In a short ceremony before last
Saturday night's volleyball match
against USC, the graduating seniors
were each presented with a bottle of
champagne and roses. Two of the
play&Ki>!ihonored are both .All-
American candidates at outside hitter
for the Cardinal — Chris Braun and
Jon Root, the top hitters for the
squad this season.
The pair have little in common
other than their position and their
graduating status, however. Well,
okay, they're both tall, too. Braun is
6-foot-6, Root is 6-5. But that's
where the similarities end. In reality,
the two are worlds apart.
For starters, Braun and Root
arrived at Stanford in very different
situations — Root as one of the most
highly recruited players in the
country and Braun as a player with
great physical potential but little ac
tual experience.
"They were two very completely
different kinds of players," said Stan
ford Co-coach Fred Sturm, who along
with Don Shaw has coached both
seniors during their careers at Stan
ford. "Chris played a lot more bas
ketball, Jon more volleyball. Jon
came from a hotbed of volleyball, his
high school especially. He had a lot
more experience.
"Jon was the No. 1 recruit in the
nation — the best prospect that year
along with Troy Tanner (now at Pep
perdine). Braun was recruited more
on his capability than on his ability.
Jon was recruited on his ability."
"Jon was a more accomplished vol

leyball player," Shaw agreed. "Chris
hadn't had much experience, he was
pretty green. But his hitting has made
him develop into one of the most
feared hitters in the conference and
the country. That's quite a step."
"Root was one of the most highly
touted high school players in the
country," fellow sefiior a'nd team cap
tain Brett Monello said. "Chris Braun
was in the most pure sense an un
known quantity. He was tall and had
the physical skills, but he was raw."
Root was recruited by volleyball
powerhouses UCLA, USC, UC-
Santa Barbara and Pcpperdine, along
with Stanford, who, at the time, had
not had a winning season since 1977.
"I came here because of the loca
tion and because I thought that Stan
ford had a program I could help out a
lot," Root explained. "Also because
of the coaches and the academic
rigors, the intellectual challenge."
Braun was also recruited by UCLA
and USC for volleyball — and by
UC-Irvine and Oregon State for bas
ketball. "My dad taught me volleyball
when 1 was a junior in high school,"
Braun said. "1 just screwed around,
though. I only really played organized
volleyball here.
"I came here because of the all
around program that Stanford of
fers," he continued, "and the good
sporting tradition, and I didn't want
to go to school in L.A. And 1 knew
the coaches were good guys."
Root entered the starting lineup
immediately his freshman year.
"Until my senior year I never missed
a game of a match for any reason,"
said the senior who has been beset by
injuries this season. Braun, however,

was a different story.
"This is my second year starting."
Braun said. "I didn't play much
before, only sporadically. I'd go in in
the front row, then rotate out. My
playing time was limited.
"After my sophomore year, I
thought I wouldn't play my junior
year," he added. "It was frustrating. I
thought I wasn't getting the opportu
nity to improve. I thought I might
play basketball or another sport. I
decided I wouldn't play volleyball my
junior year.
"A lot of things changed my
mind," Braun continued. "For four
months 1 didn't even think about vol
leyball, 1 didn't play at all. I came
back to school, I was an RAin a
dorm, and I didn't think I'd have
enough time. Then (setter) Craig
Lauchner called me and said we'd
changed our offense and I would play
a lot.
"1 was skeptical. I had a negative
attitude after two years without
playing much. I came out three weeks
into the pre-season, and 1 got into
drills more and played more. 1 found
1 could balance my time as an RA,
too.
"In the Santa Barbara tournament
I started every game and I did pretty
well. The team was more confident
about me, and 1 had more confidence
in myself. Once you get your confi
dence up, you can play in this
league."
And the rest is Stanford history —
which Braun made when he recorded
an outstanding 49 kills against UCLA
earlier this season.
"That was clearly the most impres
sive hitting effort ever seen in Maples

Pavilion," Sturm said "That's what
can happen when Chris is in the flow
of things; he showed what he's capa
ble of doing. He had 10 kills in 10 hit
ting attempts in game two. What was
incredible is that UCLA is known as a
strong blocking team."
"Steve Modory was setting particu
larly well that night," Braun ex
plained." If you have a good set, it's
hard to screw up."
Braun leads the Cardinal into the
NCAA West Regional tomorrow
with 404 kills, tops on the team, and a
.313 hitting percentage, second
among the starters. He is considered
a strong candidate for Ail-American
honors. He was an honorable men
tion All-American last season when
he also led the Cardinal in kills (297)
as well as average (.322).
"When you improve as much as
Chris has," Sturm said,"it has a lot to
do with Chris Braun. It's a real trib
ute to him. You're only as good as
you work to become. He had to sit
down and think through his goals.
Once he was committed to volleyball,
we saw a change in Chris Braun."
"Chris is capable of much more in
the game of volleyball," Shaw said.

"It's just a question of putting his
mind to it."
Monello agreed. "Chris has not
reached his potential. He has an in
credible reach and jumping ability;
he's fairly agile. There's no block in
the league he can't hit over. He has
all the necessary physical talents. His
blocking is a long way from being as
good as it could be; with his physical
endowments, he could be the best
blocker in the league."
"I think people knew what they
were in for after the first few games
this season," Root said. "He's
progressed at such a steady level. This
is the culmination."
And what of All-American Root,
who toured with the U.S. National
Team last year? The senior has been
troubled with injuries, including a
severely sprained ankle and a sore
shoulder and missed four matches
this season, yet still is second in kills
and third among starters in
average (.282). Last year he led the
squad in digs, block solos and block
assists. Despite his injuries, he is

along with Troy Tanner (now at Pep
perdine). Braun was recruited more
on his capability than on his ability.
Jon was recruited on his ability."
"Jon was a more accomplished vol

leyball player," Shaw agreed. "Chris
hadn't had much experience, he was
pretty green. But his hitting has made
him develop into one of the most
feared hitters in the conference and
the country. That's quite a step."
"Root was one of the most highly
touted high school players in the
country," fellow sefiior a'nd team cap
tain Brett Monello said. "Chris Braun
was in the most pure sense an un
known quantity. He was tall and had
the physical skills, but he was raw."
Root was recruited by volleyball
powerhouses UCLA, USC, UC-
Santa Barbara and Pcpperdine, along
with Stanford, who, at the time, had
not had a winning season since 1977.
"I came here because of the loca
tion and because I thought that Stan
ford had a program I could help out a
lot," Root explained. "Also because
of the coaches and the academic
rigors, the intellectual challenge."
Braun was also recruited by UCLA
and USC for volleyball — and by
UC-Irvine and Oregon State for bas
ketball. "My dad taught me volleyball
when 1 was a junior in high school,"
Braun said. "1 just screwed around,
though. I only really played organized
volleyball here.
"I came here because of the all
around program that Stanford of
fers," he continued, "and the good
sporting tradition, and I didn't want
to go to school in L.A. And 1 knew
the coaches were good guys."
Root entered the starting lineup
immediately his freshman year.
"Until my senior year I never missed
a game of a match for any reason,"
said the senior who has been beset by
injuries this season. Braun, however,

was a different story.
"This is my second year starting."
Braun said. "I didn't play much
before, only sporadically. I'd go in in
the front row, then rotate out. My
playing time was limited.
"After my sophomore year, I
thought I wouldn't play my junior
year," he added. "It was frustrating. I
thought I wasn't getting the opportu
nity to improve. I thought I might
play basketball or another sport. I
decided I wouldn't play volleyball my
junior year.
"A lot of things changed my
mind," Braun continued. "For four
months 1 didn't even think about vol
leyball, 1 didn't play at all. I came
back to school, I was an RAin a
dorm, and I didn't think I'd have
enough time. Then (setter) Craig
Lauchner called me and said we'd
changed our offense and I would play
a lot.
"1 was skeptical. I had a negative
attitude after two years without
playing much. I came out three weeks
into the pre-season, and 1 got into
drills more and played more. 1 found
1 could balance my time as an RA,
too.
"In the Santa Barbara tournament
I started every game and I did pretty
well. The team was more confident
about me, and 1 had more confidence
in myself. Once you get your confi
dence up, you can play in this
league."
And the rest is Stanford history —
which Braun made when he recorded
an outstanding 49 kills against UCLA
earlier this season.
"That was clearly the most impres
sive hitting effort ever seen in Maples

Pavilion," Sturm said "That's what
can happen when Chris is in the flow
of things; he showed what he's capa
ble of doing. He had 10 kills in 10 hit
ting attempts in game two. What was
incredible is that UCLA is known as a
strong blocking team."
"Steve Modory was setting particu
larly well that night," Braun ex
plained." If you have a good set, it's
hard to screw up."
Braun leads the Cardinal into the
NCAA West Regional tomorrow
with 404 kills, tops on the team, and a
.313 hitting percentage, second
among the starters. He is considered
a strong candidate for Ail-American
honors. He was an honorable men
tion All-American last season when
he also led the Cardinal in kills (297)
as well as average (.322).
"When you improve as much as
Chris has," Sturm said,"it has a lot to
do with Chris Braun. It's a real trib
ute to him. You're only as good as
you work to become. He had to sit
down and think through his goals.
Once he was committed to volleyball,
we saw a change in Chris Braun."
"Chris is capable of much more in
the game of volleyball," Shaw said.

"It's just a question of putting his
mind to it."
Monello agreed. "Chris has not
reached his potential. He has an in
credible reach and jumping ability;
he's fairly agile. There's no block in
the league he can't hit over. He has
all the necessary physical talents. His
blocking is a long way from being as
good as it could be; with his physical
endowments, he could be the best
blocker in the league."
"I think people knew what they
were in for after the first few games
this season," Root said. "He's
progressed at such a steady level. This
is the culmination."
And what of All-American Root,
who toured with the U.S. National
Team last year? The senior has been
troubled with injuries, including a
severely sprained ankle and a sore
shoulder and missed four matches
this season, yet still is second in kills
and third among starters in
average (.282). Last year he led the
squad in digs, block solos and block
assists. Despite his injuries, he is

Sturm, "hasn't even come close to his potential. His improvement in a two-year span has
been phenomenal."
second in all of those categories this
year.
"Overall I'm pretty satisfied,"
Root said. "My hitting is a little bet
ter, and I've adjusted to the outside
hitter position (from middle blocker).
My injuries depressed me a little. I
feel I'm having a good year; I thought
I could have had an outstanding
year."
"In many ways Jon is playing better
than last year," Sturm said. "He's
more consistent. He's matured a lot
in things that can't be measured in
statistics — like leadership. He's a
great player, very complete, very ver
satile. He's the best all-around player
I've ever coached. Players like that
don't come by very often."
"It's definitely been frustrating for
Jon," Monello said." He has ambi
tions to play on the national team and
sees the entire year as a time to prove
something to the national coaches
and to the volleyball world. He's un
der a lot of pressure. He's kind of put
all his eggs in one basket. Playing on
the national team is extremely impor

tant to him.
"Jon puts a lot of pressure on him
self to perform; sometimes he expects
too much from himself. He's having a
very good year. At times he's showed
he's the best player in the CIVA."
Volleyball is very much a part of
Root's future plans. "Hopefully I'll
hear from the national team soon,
and I'll travel with them again. I'll
join after I get out of school. I'd like
to go to '88 (Olympics); then, if I'm
still interested and I make it that far,
maybe another two years.
"I don't know if I could take it to
'92. I think three or four years max.
I'd be 26 then; that's a good time to
start making a living," said Root, a
political science and economics major
from Marina Del Rey. "Nothing too
structured, though. The investment
banking, corporate world isn't
looking too good right now. I need
some free time, some creativity, to be
outdoors. I'm not going to get into
coaching."
Braun, on the other hand, is going
to get into coaching right away — as a
Stanford assistant coach next season.
The human biology major will be
back next year as an RA and will also
be the business manager for KZSU.

As if all that isn't enough, the
native of Carmichael has recently
started the Stanford Club for
Entrepreneurial Education, which
funds student buisness projects with
no interest loans and no risk, sending
all profits to charitable organizations.
Clearly, the two differ vastly off the
court. Braun is considering buisness
school; Root says,"l haven't totally
geared myself for the buisness aspect
of my life yet." While Root will prob
ably be with the national team next
year, Braun may play in Europe in
the future.
"Volleyball is not as much a part of
his life as mine right now," Root said.
"I've got more riding on this; I plan
to take it a little further."
"Jon has really concentrated on
volleyball," Braun said. "Volleyball
is important to me, but I've tried to
diversify and get the most out of
Stanford, enjoy all my opportuni
ties."
Just as the two have separate
ests, they are very different per
sonally. "They have such different
personalities, they are such different
people," Shaw said. "They're like
night and day. Jon is more outwardly
intense. They look at the game in a

different way."
"Jon says what he feels, Chris
shows how he feels," Sturm agreed.
"Chris is very quiet, while Jon is very
vocal and outspoken. Their roles are
very different. Chris is the team's hit
ter, and Jon is not only the hitter, he's
a passer, a server, a blocker. Chris
adds a lot with his hitting; Jon adds a
lot of other things as well."
"Jon is very emotional," Monello
said. "Sometimes he's a supercharged
ball of fun, sometimes he's moody
and introspective. Chris is stoic. Not
boring, but calm and steady. He
keeps it inside. Jon is prone to both.
Sometimes he'll yell and rage,
sometimes he'll sit and sulk."
"Chris is our designated hitter basi
cally," Shaw explained. "Jon does it
all for us. Chris' hitting is so
awesome, so amazing, that's what
stands out. Jon is important to have
out there for all sorts of things. Physi
cally he can do it all. They are both
looked to for different reasons."
"Our opponents follow both of
them around when they're in the
front row," Sturm said. "They're our
two big guns and that's a tribute to
them."
In a short ceremony before last
Saturday night's volleyball match
against USC, the graduating seniors
were each presented with a bottle of
champagne and roses. Two of the
play&Ki>!ihonored are both .All-
American candidates at outside hitter
for the Cardinal — Chris Braun and
Jon Root, the top hitters for the
squad this season.
The pair have little in common
other than their position and their
graduating status, however. Well,
okay, they're both tall, too. Braun is
6-foot-6, Root is 6-5. But that's
where the similarities end. In reality,
the two are worlds apart.
For starters, Braun and Root
arrived at Stanford in very different
situations — Root as one of the most
highly recruited players in the
country and Braun as a player with
great physical potential but little ac
tual experience.
"They were two very completely
different kinds of players," said Stan
ford Co-coach Fred Sturm, who along
with Don Shaw has coached both
seniors during their careers at Stan
ford. "Chris played a lot more bas
ketball, Jon more volleyball. Jon
came from a hotbed of volleyball, his
high school especially. He had a lot
more experience.
"Jon was the No. 1 recruit in the
nation — the best prospect that year
along with Troy Tanner (now at Pep
perdine). Braun was recruited more
on his capability than on his ability.
Jon was recruited on his ability."
"Jon was a more accomplished vol

leyball player," Shaw agreed. "Chris

"Root was one of the most highly

was in the most pure sense an un
known quantity. He was tall and had
the physical skills, but he was raw."

I've ever coached. Players like that
don't come by very often."
"It's definitely been frustrating for
Jon," Monello said." He has ambi
tions to play on the national team and
sees the entire year as a time to prove
something to the national coaches
and to the volleyball world. He's un
der a lot of pressure. He's kind of put
all his eggs in one basket. Playing on
the national team is extremely impor

tant to him.
"Jon puts a lot of pressure on him
self to perform; sometimes he expects
too much from himself. He's having a
very good year. At times he's showed
he's the best player in the CIVA."
Volleyball is very much a part of
Root's future plans. "Hopefully I'll
hear from the national team soon,
and I'll travel with them again. I'll
join after I get out of school. I'd like
to go to '88 (Olympics); then, if I'm
still interested and I make it that far,
maybe another two years.
"I don't know if I could take it to
'92. I think three or four years max.
I'd be 26 then; that's a good time to
start making a living," said Root, a
political science and economics major
from Marina Del Rey. "Nothing too
structured, though. The investment
banking, corporate world isn't
looking too good right now. I need
some free time, some creativity, to be
outdoors. I'm not going to get into
coaching."
Braun, on the other hand, is going
to get into coaching right away — as a
Stanford assistant coach next season.
The human biology major will be
back next year as an RA and will also
be the business manager for KZSU.

As if all that isn't enough, the
native of Carmichael has recently
started the Stanford Club for
Entrepreneurial Education, which
funds student buisness projects with
no interest loans and no risk, sending
all profits to charitable organizations.
Clearly, the two differ vastly off the
court. Braun is considering buisness
school; Root says,"l haven't totally
geared myself for the buisness aspect
of my life yet." While Root will prob
ably be with the national team next
year, Braun may play in Europe in
the future.
"Volleyball is not as much a part of
his life as mine right now," Root said.
"I've got more riding on this; I plan
to take it a little further."
"Jon has really concentrated on
volleyball," Braun said. "Volleyball
is important to me, but I've tried to
diversify and get the most out of
Stanford, enjoy all my opportuni
ties."
Just as the two have separate
ests, they are very different per
sonally. "They have such different
personalities, they are such different
people," Shaw said. "They're like
night and day. Jon is more outwardly
intense. They look at the game in a

different way."
"Jon says what he feels, Chris
shows how he feels," Sturm agreed.
"Chris is very quiet, while Jon is very
vocal and outspoken. Their roles are
very different. Chris is the team's hit
ter, and Jon is not only the hitter, he's
a passer, a server, a blocker. Chris
adds a lot with his hitting; Jon adds a
lot of other things as well."
"Jon is very emotional," Monello
said. "Sometimes he's a supercharged
ball of fun, sometimes he's moody
and introspective. Chris is stoic. Not
boring, but calm and steady. He
keeps it inside. Jon is prone to both.
Sometimes he'll yell and rage,
sometimes he'll sit and sulk."
"Chris is our designated hitter basi
cally," Shaw explained. "Jon does it
all for us. Chris' hitting is so
awesome, so amazing, that's what
stands out. Jon is important to have
out there for all sorts of things. Physi
cally he can do it all. They are both
looked to for different reasons."
"Our opponents follow both of
them around when they're in the
front row," Sturm said. "They're our
two big guns and that's a tribute to
them."
