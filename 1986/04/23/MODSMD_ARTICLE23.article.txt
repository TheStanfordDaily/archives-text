With four Cardinal seniors
graduating in June, Stanford
Coach Dick Gould was hoping
for a strong recruiting class this
year in order to continue the
lofty Cardinal men's tennis
tradition next season.
Gould got his wish.
Two of the top five high
school seniors in the nation
have signed letters of intent to
attend Stanford. They are Jeff
Cathrall of Lakewood, Col.,
and Jeff Tarango of Manhattan
Beach.
"I'm thrilled that we've
signed these two," Gould said.
"We're losing four seniors from
this year's team, but in Cathrall
and Tarango I feel we're
halfway there towards keeping
Stanford at or near the top."
Also verbally committing to
Stanford was Eric Peus, a high
school senior from Santa Bar
bara.
Cathrall, who is the highest
ranking high school senior in
the country, also plays soccer
and runs track.
He said he had narrowed
down his choices to either Stan
ford or Duke before finally de
ciding on the Farm.
"I picked Stanford partly be
cause of the educational oppor
tunity — although that was
close — but more because of
the interesting atmosphere on
(the Stanford) campus,"
Cathrall said yesterday. "Plus I
like the coach a lot."
Cathrall also said that he is
looking forward to working
with Tarango next year.
Tarango, meanwhile, will
play for the Junior Davis Cup
team which will represent the
United States this summer in
the Junior Wimbledon Tourna
ment.
He said he was also consider
ing USC, UCLA, UC-Irvine
and California before finally
choosing Stanford.
"It's just that Stanford is the
best in combining both
academics and tennis,"
Tarango said. "Whereas the
other schools might not be so
strong ih both."
Tarango said he is looking
forward to representing Stan
ford as a school and also the
change of pace of college ten
nis.
"Hopefully I can get my
doubles game going in college,
because the juniors doesn't
really let you do that," he said.
"Although (Tarango) is a
year younger than Cathrall, I
think it's safe to say that he's on
about the same level," Gould
said. "I expect both players to
contribute a great deal next
year."
