# Cycling going strong

I hey gather in front of the post office every
afternoon at 3:30. They draw the stares of
contused passersby as they mill about on
bicycles. I his collection of students clad in a
rainbow ot jerseys is the Stanford cycling club.
Organized under the auspices of the club
sports program, the Stanford cycling club is an
intercollegiate racing team. Currently celebrat
ing its l()th anniversary, the team is enjoying an
all-time high.
It boasts a roster of over 40 riders. This is the
largest the club has ever been, and the high level
ot participation is most likely due to the blos
soming popularity of cycling in the United
Suites and to the winning performances of U.S.
cyclists in the 19N4 Olympic Games.
I his year's Stanford team is starting strong
and coming back from a triumphant
season in which it emerged as the West Coast
collegiate champion. M;iny of the team's key
performers have returned. Among the veterans
are undergraduates Brad Chen and Russell
Mead.
Both Chen and Mead qualified for the na
tional championships last summer, where Mead
placed sixth in the grueling one-kilometer track
event and was selected as a member of the U.S.
National Team.
1 hey are joined by experienced and talented
graduate student rider Art Walker, who is ex
pected to lead the men's divisions this year.

Rounding out the squad are Kayo Ramirez.
Tom Mover. Michael Collins. Mike Fadich and
Eric Saltzman.
Much of the Stanford club's success is due to
its powerful women's team. Last year senior
rider katrin Tobin dominated the women's
events. In only her third season of racing. Tobin
has now graduated from Stanford to race with a
nationally sponsored touring team. She placed
sixth in the Nationals this summer and was se
lected to the U.S. World Team.
The women's team hopes to fill the void made
by Tobin's departure with Pam Stevenson, Jen
nifer Hubbert and returning team captain Laura
Rodman.
Stanford is assisted by the technological
magic of former team rider Eric Topp, a me
chanical engineer now working at the local
Wheelsmith bicycle shop. Topp has custom
produced two high-tech bicycles for the team
with funding provided by the club sports pro
gram. These bicycles resemble the U.S. custom
Olympic bicycles
The squads have competed in several races
already this season including the 40-mile Sutter
Butte Road Race which Mead won.
On April 5, the cyclists hosted the Stanford
Criterium. The Cardinal men and women
combined to take the team crown over several
other schools.
Stevenson won the women's race and was one
of three Stanford riders in the top five. Hubbert
and Rodman took fourth and fifth, respectively.
