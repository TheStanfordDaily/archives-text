# Giants top LA, 10-3

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San
Francisco scored seven runs before
the first out was recorded in the first
inning, with Chili Davis' two-run
double sparking the rally as the
Giants streaked to their sixth straight
victory last night with a 10-3 rout of
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Chris Brown led first-place San
Francisco's 14-hit attack with four
hits and scored three runs. Davis
drove in three runs.
The last time the Giants, 10-4,
were in first place this late in the
season was Aug. 13, 1978.
Los Angeles starter Dennis Powell,
0-3, failed to record an out before
leaving the game. The left-hander
faced only five batters, giving up a
leadoff walk and four straight hits, in
cluding the two-run double to Davis
for a 4-0 San Francisco lead.
Reliever Carlos Diaz wasn't any
more successful, giving up three hits
and walking one before Dan Gladden
— the 10th batter in the big inning —
hit into a run-scoring force out for the
Giants first out of the game.
Giants starter Mike Krukow, 3-0,
picked up the win.
