Black S.A. mayor resigns
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — One of South Africa's last black
mayors with political credibility in his own community resigned yester
day, dealing a severe blow to the controversial system of local black self
government and to hopes that it would produce moderate black leaders.
The Rev. Sam Buti, the mayor of Alexandra, a black township on the
northern edge of Johannesburg, resigned along with the three remaining
members of his town council, saying they could no longer withstand
community pressure to quit a system that most blacks reject as helping
underpin apartheid.
"There is no point in going on," Buti said. "The people do not under
stand our aims and objectives to build Alexandra into a model city. We
don't have their support any longer. To continue would divide our com
munity in Alex even more deeply than it is now."
Rioting broke out in Alexandra late yesterday as migrant workers
living in hostels there fought with militant youths enforcing a two-day
old boycott of white merchants — and stores owned by Buti and other
town councilors — to support calls for the withdrawal of troops from the
townships and other community demands.
Police and troops quickly surrounded Alexandra to prevent the fight
ing from spreading to nearby white residential, commercial and indus
trial areas, and Red Cross workers entered the township to remove the
injured. At least 23 persons were killed in six days of rioting there in
February.
The resignations of Buti and the last three councilmen leave
Alexandra without a mayor or town council, and many of the town's
senior municipal employees and policemen are also quitting under
mounting community pressure. White administrators will probably be
installed now to manage the impoverished black ghetto of about
100,000.
31 Western states to fight drugs
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Delegates from 31 Western Hemi
sphere countries met here yesterday to set up a permanent inter-
American commission to combat drug production, trafficking and con
sumption in the region.
Brazil, the host country, presented a proposal for a voluntary fund
that would pay for help to drug-control programs in the 32 member
countries of the Organization of American States.
The United States, the largest market in the world for illicit drugs,
now gives about $15 million a year to help narcotics control efforts in
various Latin American countries. The Brazilian proposal would set up a
15-nation commission to coordinate regional efforts and support na
tional programs through the voluntary fund.
"Disrupting the flow of illegal substances to and from our countries,
neutralizing the financial empires that handle supply, shipment and dis
tribution, and dismantling the centers of production are among our ob
jectives," said Joao Clemente Baena Soares, secretary-general of the
Organization of American States, in a speech opening the week-long
conference.
The United States delegation was led by Deputy Attorney General D.
Lowell Jensen. Many of the Latin American countries were represented
by their justice department ministers. Among these countries were Peru,
Bolivia, Mexico, Jamaica and Colombia, which play a majop role as sup
pliers of drugs such as cocaine and marijuana.
Jensen said the Reagan Administration would provide financial and
technical support for national programs that seek to wipe out drug
sources and bar smuggling. But Latin American governments frequently
argue that the drug epidemic will only be brought under control when
the demand for drugs in the United States is reduced.
Gorbachev, Honecker end summit
BERLIN — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and East German
leader Erich Honecker closed a brief summit meeting in East Berlin yes
terday by sharply criticizing U.S. foreign policy and accusing West Ger
many of undermining East-West relations in Europe.
The official East German news agency ADN reported that Gorbachev
met yesterday morning with the entire East German Politburo before
departing from East Berlin, where he had spent a week at the 11th
Congress of the ruling German Socialist Unity Party.
Gorbachev and the party's leadership charged the current Bonn gov
ernment of Chancellor Helmut Kohl with pursuing a course opposed to
East-West detente in Europe, the agency said.
The summit participants cited what they called Bonn's support for
U.S. plans "for the militarization of space, the transformation of West
German territory into a launching ramp for Pershing and cruise missiles
as well as the encouragement of dangerous revanchist forces," the news
agency reported.
Jordanian charged in bomb attempt
LONDON — Amid tight security, a Jordanian national was arraigned
here yesterday on murder conspiracy charges in connection with a plot
to blow up an Israeli jumbo jet by smuggling a bomb aboard in the hand
luggage of his pregnant Irish girlfriend.
Nczar Hindawi, 31, said by acquaintances to be from a prominent Jor
danian family, was formally charged late Monday for conspiring to kill
the woman who carried the bomb, 32-year-old Anne-Marie Murphy. He
was also accused of attempting to endanger an aircraft. The charges
came as police in West Berlin announced that Hindawi's older brother,
Ahmed Nawaf Mansur Hasi, had been detained by West Berlin police in
connection with the April 5 bombing of a discotheque crowded with
American Gls.
It was that attack, which claimed the life of one U.S. soldier and a
Turkish woman and injured 230 others, that apparently triggered the
decision to attack last week's raid against Libya.
West Berlin authorities said they believe Hasi may have played a role
in the bombing, but they said he was not the main suspect. They offered
no explanation for the different last names.
In London. Hasi's brother was driven the few miles from central
police headquarters building to a south London magistrate's court in an
armed convoy following a two-hour-long search of the area in and
around the courtroom.
Hindawi's appearance in court lasted only 18 minutes. His lawyer ap
plied for bail, but it was refused. He was ordered jailed pending another
hearing on May 1. Those in the courtroom said he seemed nervous and
confused by the proceedings.
Murphy had passed through all three main security checks at Lon
don's Heathrow airport last Thursday and was about to board an El Al
flight to Tel Aviv when the bomb was discovered by an alert member of
El Al's own private security staff.
In West Berlin, law enforcement officials indicated that Hindawi's 35-
year-old brother was arrested Friday acting on a tip from London police.
Hindawai was arrested at a small West London hotel Friday morning
after a 36-hour manhunt.
West Berlin authorities stressed that Hasi is being held as a suspected
accomplice in the discotheque bombing.
