# Retail prices fall 0.4 percent

### 
WASHINGTON — Tumbling oil prices drove
prices at the retail level down 0.4 percent in March
for the second month in a row, giving consumers
the biggest two-month price decline in 36 years, the
Labor Department reported yesterday.
Gasoline prices fell a record 12 percent last
month, and this was the major factor in the decline
in the consumer price index in March, which fol
lowed a 0.4 percent drop in February, the depart
ment said.
It was the first time prices have fallen for two
consecutive months since 1965 and was the shar
pest two-month decline since prices fell 0.4 percent
in both December 1949 and January 1950.
The decline in consumer prices in the first three
months of the year was the strongest for any quar
ter since 1954, the Labor Department said. If
prices were to continue falling at that rate through
1986, the index would be down 1.9 percent for the
year.
Energy prices overall fell 6.5 percent last month,
the Labor Department said. Consumer prices, ex
cluding energy, rose 0.3 percent.

Economists said they expect consumer prices to
continue plummeting through the spring, and then
to rise during the second half of the year as oil
prices stabilize, until inflation reaches the rate of
last year — between 3 and 4 percent.
Consumers are expected to enjoy a windfall this
year from lower oil prices, and probably will spend
nearly all of it on other goods, giving a boost to the
overall economy later in the year, economists said.
Consumer spending constitutes about two-thirds of
gross national product, which is the nation's output
of goods and services.
In addition to the slide in oil prices, consumers
are benefiting from a steady decline in interest
rates. Rates for mortgages and some other con
sumer loans are expected to fall in the next three
months, providing further savings for consumers,
economists said.
Meanwhile, paychecks were fatter last month,
the government said yesterday. Gross weekly earn
ings of workers increased 1.2 percent in March for
the largest monthly gain since a 2.3 percent in
crease in February 1982, the government said.
But perhaps the most dramatic gain for consu

mers has come from lower prices for motor fuels,
which locally fell 11.4 percent in February and
March.
Energy prices fell 16.9 percent in the first three
months of this year, an annual rate of decline of
52.3 percent. Gasoline prices are now at the level
of late 1979 and are 27 percent below their peak in
March 1981.
Medical-care costs, which generally have in
creased faster than other categories of goods and
services, rose 1 percent in March, the largest
monthly rise for this component since July 1982,
Labor said.
The price of food bought at grocery stores was
unchanged in March following a 1 percent decline
in February. The index for meats, poultry, fish,
eggs and dairy products fell last month. During the
past 12 months, beef prices have fallen 1.5 percent
and the cost of pork has dropped 1.2 percent.
The consumer price index was 326.0 in March,
which means that goods that cost $10 in 1967 cost
$32.60 last month. Another index, which is used as
an escalator in some labor agreements, was 321.4
last month.
