# ASSU divests from Stanford
## Undergrad senators named 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
A loud round of applause at the
ASSU Senate meeting last night
sealed the senate's decision to divest
ASSU funds from the University
money pools, which are invested in
companies with business dealings in
South Africa.
By a vote of 16-4, senators ap
proved the bill called "To Divest
Now," authored by Graduate Senator
Richard Beigel, along with an amend
ment by Undergraduate Senator Joel
Bellenson. When combined, they
provide for the ASSU financial
manager to withdraw ASSU funds
from the University's Merged Assets
Pool Band the Expendable Funds
fool, and to invest these iunils in the
Calvert Group's Money Market and
Managed Growth Funds.
In addition to passing the divest
ment bill, senators also received
"post preliminary" ASSU spring
election results from Elections Com
missioner Robin Miller, and validated
the election.
Undergraduate senators and their
votes are: George "Felix" Cucvas
(966), Matt Gallagher (958), Vivian
Wu (918), John van Loben Sels
(803), Stacey Estrella (771), Ben
Garcia (747), Lena Slachmuijlder

(746), Larry Bloch (717), Jeff Sloan
(712) and Stacey Leyton (687).
Alternates and their votes are:
Chris Madden (669), Chris Nadan
(650). Lisa Hulber (630), Leonard
Adler (622), Joel Bellenson (604),
Brett Mahoney (588). David Porter
(5 74), Eric Allen (563), Angela
Wood (556) and Danny Berns (540).
Before opening discussion of the
divestment bill, senators heard Uni
versity Treasurer Rodney Adams
speak about the monetary ramifica
tions of ASSU divestment. When
asked about the investment perfor
mance of the Calvert Fund, Adams
said that since the fund is new, "it is
unclear" how financially sound the
fund will be.
"To date, investments (in the Cal
vert Fund) nave been short-term, so
they get a reasonable return, not too
different from the present" returns
the University achieves, Adams said.
However, he said that because 1985
was a "good year for common
stocks," the Calvert Fund, which con
centrates on common stocks, would
necessarily get good returns.
Adams also pointed out that the
University chose the Calvert Fund as
the best monetary fund to use for the
faculty and staff South Africa-free re
tirement pension.
When asked whether he thought
the ASSLTs divestment would have
any effect on the companies doing
business in South Africa, Adams said
the "symbolism and communication"
aspects of the move will serve to
"keep the issue alive and aware," and
will therefore elicit some reaction
from corporations.
ASSU Financial Manager Duncan
Weaver said last night he did not
know exactly when the money trans
fer from the University pools to the
Calvert Fund would take place, ex
cept that the bill does specify that
"the Financial Manager is instructed
to complete this transfer as soon as
possible."
Commenting on the costs to the
ASSU of divesting, Weaver said he
thought the loss calculated in the
Report of the Subcommittee on Di
vestment issued April 8 "might be a
little low," since interest rates lately
have been going down. According to
the report, the loss incurred in trans

ferring funds from the Merged Pool B
can be estimated at $6,250 per year.
In transferring funds from the Expen
dable Funds Pool, the report says the
ASSU "would lose . .. approximately
$21,000 a year if we were to transfer
to the (Calvert) funds."
Although the ASSU's funds in the
Merged Pool B will be divested as
soon as possible, divestment from the
Expendable Funds Pool will be
delayed until the Association Operat
ing Budget for next year has been ap
proved.
Fearing that not all groups whose
funds are in the Expendable Funds
Pool will wish to divest, senators
voted to make transfer of group funds
contingent upon the agreement of the
groups' treasurers to divest.
The divestment bill further pro
vides that the "Association shall not
invest directly, or indirectly through
mutual funds, in stocks of companies
doing business in South Africa." The
amendment states further that the
"Association shall not invest directly,
or indirectly through money-market
or other funds, in the securities or
other obligations of companies doing
business in South Africa."

A loud round of applause at the
ASSU Senate meeting last night
sealed the senate's decision to divest
ASSU funds from the University
money pools, which are invested in
companies with business dealings in
South Africa.
By a vote of 16-4, senators ap
proved the bill called "To Divest
Now," authored by Graduate Senator
Richard Beigel, along with an amend
ment by Undergraduate Senator Joel
Bellenson. When combined, they
provide for the ASSU financial
manager to withdraw ASSU funds
from the University's Merged Assets
Pool Band the Expendable Funds
fool, and to invest these iunils in the
Calvert Group's Money Market and
Managed Growth Funds.
In addition to passing the divest
ment bill, senators also received
"post preliminary" ASSU spring
election results from Elections Com
missioner Robin Miller, and validated
the election.
Undergraduate senators and their
votes are: George "Felix" Cucvas
(966), Matt Gallagher (958), Vivian
Wu (918), John van Loben Sels
(803), Stacey Estrella (771), Ben
Garcia (747), Lena Slachmuijlder

(746), Larry Bloch (717), Jeff Sloan
(712) and Stacey Leyton (687).
Alternates and their votes are:
Chris Madden (669), Chris Nadan
(650). Lisa Hulber (630), Leonard
Adler (622), Joel Bellenson (604),
Brett Mahoney (588). David Porter
(5 74), Eric Allen (563), Angela
Wood (556) and Danny Berns (540).
Before opening discussion of the
divestment bill, senators heard Uni
versity Treasurer Rodney Adams
speak about the monetary ramifica
tions of ASSU divestment. When
asked about the investment perfor
mance of the Calvert Fund, Adams
said that since the fund is new, "it is
unclear" how financially sound the
fund will be.
"To date, investments (in the Cal
vert Fund) nave been short-term, so
they get a reasonable return, not too
different from the present" returns
the University achieves, Adams said.
However, he said that because 1985
was a "good year for common
stocks," the Calvert Fund, which con
centrates on common stocks, would
necessarily get good returns.
Adams also pointed out that the
University chose the Calvert Fund as
the best monetary fund to use for the
faculty and staff South Africa-free re
tirement pension.
When asked whether he thought
the ASSLTs divestment would have
any effect on the companies doing
business in South Africa, Adams said
the "symbolism and communication"
aspects of the move will serve to
"keep the issue alive and aware," and
will therefore elicit some reaction
from corporations.
ASSU Financial Manager Duncan
Weaver said last night he did not
know exactly when the money trans
fer from the University pools to the
Calvert Fund would take place, ex
cept that the bill does specify that
"the Financial Manager is instructed
to complete this transfer as soon as
possible."
Commenting on the costs to the
ASSU of divesting, Weaver said he
thought the loss calculated in the
Report of the Subcommittee on Di
vestment issued April 8 "might be a
little low," since interest rates lately
have been going down. According to
the report, the loss incurred in trans

ferring funds from the Merged Pool B
can be estimated at $6,250 per year.
In transferring funds from the Expen
dable Funds Pool, the report says the
ASSU "would lose . .. approximately
$21,000 a year if we were to transfer
to the (Calvert) funds."
Although the ASSU's funds in the
Merged Pool B will be divested as
soon as possible, divestment from the
Expendable Funds Pool will be
delayed until the Association Operat
ing Budget for next year has been ap
proved.
Fearing that not all groups whose
funds are in the Expendable Funds
Pool will wish to divest, senators
voted to make transfer of group funds
contingent upon the agreement of the
groups' treasurers to divest.
The divestment bill further pro
vides that the "Association shall not
invest directly, or indirectly through
mutual funds, in stocks of companies
doing business in South Africa." The
amendment states further that the
"Association shall not invest directly,
or indirectly through money-market
or other funds, in the securities or
other obligations of companies doing
business in South Africa."
