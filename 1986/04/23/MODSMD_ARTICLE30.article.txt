# U.N. wanted Waldheim tried
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The U.N. War
Crimes Commission concluded in
1948 that there was sufficient
evidence to prosecute Kurt
Waldheim for the murder of Yugos
lav partisans during World War 11,
and it put him on its top priority A
list of persons who should be brought
to trial, according to a secret U.N. file
obtained by The Washington Post
yeste rday.
The file is based on a report
prepared in late 1947 by an official
Yugoslav war-crimes commission and
alleges that Waldheim was involved
in "murder" and "putting hostages to
death" from April 1944 to May 1945.
The U.N. commission said that
after examining the facts, it believed
that "a clear prima facie case had
been presented,"and that Waldheim
"should be delivered up for trial."
The allegations in the U.N. file
have been a key element in the con
troversy over WaldheinVs wartime
activities as a German army officer in
the Balkans. Details of the charges
were made public by a Yugoslav
newspaper last month, but the U.N.
has kept the file secret, while giving
copies to the Israeli and Austrian
governments on April 9 under a
pledge of confidentiality.
Waldheim, who served as U.N. sec

retary general from 1972 to 1982, has
called the charges in the U.N. dossier
false and has denied any involvement
in war crimes during his service in
Yugoslavia and Greece from 1942 to
1945.
Waldheim is a candidate for presi
dent of Austria in elections to be held
May 4. The current president,

Rudolph Kirchschlaeger, went on
Austrian television yesterday to say
that after examining the U.N. file and
other documents provided by the
World Jewish Congress, he could not
make a judgment about Waldheim's
guilt or innocence.
However, Kirchschlaeger, a widely
respected former jurist, said that if he

were in the position of a prosecutor,
"on the basis of the evidence pre
sented to me. . .1 would not dare to
file an indictment in a regular court."
Some U.N. officials have spec
ulated privately that the file "fell be
tween the cracks" and gathered dust
in the archives for so long because
Waldheim, in his memoirs and other
biographical statements, concealed
the fact that he had served in the
Balkans, claiming instead that he
spent the last years of the war as a
student in Vienna.
Other observers have noted that
the Yugoslav charges were made
when Yugoslavia, now an indepen
dent communist state, was a satellite
of the Soviet Union.
They theorize that in the Cold War
climate of that time, officials of the
United States and other Western
countries concentrated their attention
on war crimes committed in Western
Europe and did not give much
priority and attention to persons
sought by the communist bloc.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on human rights, which yesterday
heard war crime charges against
Waldheim, indicated that he will
postpone further hearings until after
the May 4 election.
