ranging investigation into allegations of drug
dealing, gun-running and other illegal activities

by leaders of the insurgency, it was learned yes

has been collected by the staff of Sen. John Kerry

sified by big brokerage houses that use comput
erized selling programs, which are triggered
when disparities occur between the price of
stocks and stock futures.
