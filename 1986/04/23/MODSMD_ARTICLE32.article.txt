Soviet spy testifies
LOS ANGELES — A Soviet woman who has
admitted to having a love affair with former FBI
agent Richard Miller testified yesterday she was
sexually involved with another agent years earlier
but insisted she didn't try to help the Soviet Un
ion through the affair.
Svetlana Ogorodnikov choked hack tears as
she testified about a sexual affair with John Hunt,
an FBI agent she met in 1980. She said she an
swered questions for him and provided informa
tion about the Soviet community but indicated
her motive was personal, not political.
Miller, the only FBI agent ever tried on
espionage charges, is accused of giving her classi
fied documents in exchange for promises of
$65,000 in gold and cash.
She took the stand after lengthy arguments by
lawyers in the judge's chambers. But once she
faced the jury, the small, blonde woman with a
new short-cropped hairdo seemed reluctant to
testify and announced she was extremely ner
vous.
Ogorodnikov, who is serving an 18-year prison

sentence for espionage following her earlier trial
in the case, was given immunity from further pro
secution yesterday by U.S. District Judge David
Kenyon and was told to answer all questions
from Levine truthfully.
Ogorodnikov never testified at her own trial on
espionage charges and was not called as a witness
at Millers first trial. A jury deadlock last Novem
ber caused him to be tried again.
Levine led her through an account of her early
years in the United States after she and husband
Nikolay emigrated in 1973. She told of going into
the film business with a Russian man from San
Francisco and said she sometimes entertained
Soviet diplomats because her film partner asked
her to make them feel at home.
Levine's questioning then focused on her rela
tionship with Hunt, who has denied any sexual
involvement with Ogorodnikov. He has said he
cultivated her as an informant for two years.

In her testimony yesterday, she also alleged
Hunt had lied to his FBI bosses about her value
as an informant because he wanted to continue
their affair.

Condor snared by net
LOS ANGELES — An adult male condor,
one of only five endangered vultures still soaring
in the wild, was snared in flight by a cannon
launched net and brought to the Los Angeles
Zoo, a spokeswoman said yesterday.
The giant bird, believed to be 10 years old and
known as AC-6 by biologists, is crucial to the
Condor Captive Breeding Program, Lorrie
Cohen of the Los Angeles Zoo said.
"He is only the fifth adult condor in captivity,"
she said. "He is genetically criticial to the Condor
Captive Breeding Program."
The bird was transported by vehicle to the Los
Angeles Zoo, where it is hoped it will breed with
female condor Tama-Yawut.
