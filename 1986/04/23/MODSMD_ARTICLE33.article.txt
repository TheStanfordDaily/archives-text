# JOE ZAWINFUL
## 
### GREG PTACEK 
On Joe Zawinful's new solo albom,
"Dialects," he briogs the folk sounds of the
world into his jazz.

Music fans know Joe Zawinful's
music far better than his name.
Mention Weather Report, and
almost everyone calls them
their favorite jazz band. Even those who
aren't intimately familiar with their music
know the tune of "Birdland," the hit sin
gle he wrote for the mega album Heavy
Weather (1977). Mention his name, and
the response tends to be, "Zawin what?",
except from those jazz afficionados who
know to rank him with Miles Davis, Dave
Brubeck and a handful of other modern
jazz masters.
That's o.k. with Joe. He would much
rather be a musician-artist than a musi
cian -celebrity. Born in a Slavic town of 58
people in rural Austria, he's never left his
roots, emotionally or intellectually. Dia
lects, his first solo album since co-found
ing Weather Report with Wayne Shorter,
reflects his respect for farm people and
their folk music, whether from Austria,
Africa, Asia or Australia.
On a recent sunny California morning,
Zawinful sipped coffee poolside at his
Pasadena home on a hill overlooking the
Rose Bowl. His house reflects his person
ality: down to earth, more comfortable
than hip, pets everywhere.
He shared his thoughts on his album,
the impending break up of Weather Re
port, sting as a jazz artist, roc k 'n' roll, the
future ol jazz and the recording industry.
CHG. Why did you decide to make a
solo album now?
JZ-. I've wanted to make this album for
15 years, but my work with Weather Re
port always precluded it. When you put
out an album, sometimes two albums, ev
ery year, there just isn't time. Several of
the songs, though, I had written many
years ago. It only took me two months to
put it together. With Wayne [Shorter] do
ing his own album, it finally gave me an
opportunity to do mine.
CEG. What's the future for Weather Re
port, now that you and Wayne Shorter are
off on your own?

J/.. Weather Report has a new album
coming out April 15. The band will proba
bly tour between June and November,
but we might have to bury the name.
Wayne has his own band now and isn't
part of Weather Report anymore. Wayne
and I share the copyright for the name, so
we probably can't go under that name. If
we can't, then it's very likely we will call
the band Weather Update.
CHG: What kind of research did you do
to capture the international sound you've
achieved on Dialects?
,/Z: Absolutely none. The album is just
my impression of the many peoples and
places I have visited. I was not trying to
imitate other culture's music. I don't even
know any African or Japanese music. If it
sounds authentic, it's because I'm a good
listener. The music I created was based
more on people's speaking patterns than
anything else.

CEG. I low are jazz and folk related?
To me, jazz is simply improvised
rhythmic music with a heavy folklore
background. Pure jazz is improvisation.
All of Dialects is improvised; in fact, two
of the tunes, "The Harvest" and "Zee
Bop," are total improvisation—com
posed, played and recorded simulta
neously. And all the others were impro
vised, but the sound of the original
improvisation was not good enough, so I
recorded them again. There was no mas
ter blueprint to the album. That would
take the pure soul away. That would be
like try ing to prepare yourself to tell a girl
you love her. I low do you practice some
thing like that?
CEG. Mow has rock n' roll affected
your music?
J'/.. To be perfectly honest, rock has
never had any effect on my music, aes
thetically. Certainly, there have been
great rock musicians. Jimi Hendrix
comes immediately to mind. But Weather
Report was not influenced by them.
We're really a traditional jazz band, in the
sense of Ellington and Louis Armstrong,
that continues to explore new territory.
1 grew up as an accordion player, play
ing with gypsies and playing folk music.
Folk music is in my blood and my bones,
and therefore I love jazz. Rock n' roll
used to be great, or at least some of it, but
1 honestly could not name five rock musi
cians that I like, that I consider to be ex
cellent. My kids listen to that stuff, and 1
do like the Talking I leads.
CEG: What do you think of the recent
synthesis of pop and jazz, say, for exam-

pie on Sting's Dream of the Blue Turtles
JZ. I le's more of a jazz musician than a
rock musician. The Police invented their
own brand of music and they've said they
are very influenced by Weather Report. In
one interview, Sting actually said he is try
ing to emulate my vision hut in a song
form with lyrics, etc.
But pop musicians like Sting are so
rare. If I were to work with him, I could
make him into a superior jazz singer. He's
got a great voice, number one. He's got
really good rhythm concepts, he's a musi
cian—a good bass player and he's got
confidence. All the ingredients are there.
CllG. What's holding jazz back from
reaching a wider audience?
JZ. The powers that control the record
ing industry don't want jazz to be great. If
jazz becomes great, then what happens to
all that other junk that so much time and
money has been invested into? If you
own a restaurant and you really think
you've got a shot at making a lot of money
by selling your version of junk food,
you're going to ignore someone who tells
you to serve really good food so that peo
ple know what it's like.
It's the same thing in the record indus
try. Most people who run the industry are
in it because they like to listen to music,
and it's an easy job. They have no qualifi
cations. They get a big expense account '
and can take their favorite stars to lunch.
And whoever shakes more hands is the
most powerful.
I was never a handshaker. I'm not inter
ested in power lunches. I'd rather eat
lunch here with my wife and kids. I am a
musician. I don't need cocktail parties. ♦

CllG. What's holding jazz back from
reaching a wider audience?
JZ. The powers that control the record
ing industry don't want jazz to be great. If
jazz becomes great, then what happens to
all that other junk that so much time and
money has been invested into? If you
own a restaurant and you really think
you've got a shot at making a lot of money
by selling your version of junk food,
you're going to ignore someone who tells
you to serve really good food so that peo
ple know what it's like.
It's the same thing in the record indus
try. Most people who run the industry are
in it because they like to listen to music,
and it's an easy job. They have no qualifi
cations. They get a big expense account '
and can take their favorite stars to lunch.
And whoever shakes more hands is the
most powerful.
I was never a handshaker. I'm not inter
ested in power lunches. I'd rather eat
lunch here with my wife and kids. I am a
musician. I don't need cocktail parties. ♦

On Joe Zawinful's new solo albom,
"Dialects," he briogs the folk sounds of the
world into his jazz.

Music fans know Joe Zawinful's
music far better than his name.
Mention Weather Report, and
almost everyone calls them
their favorite jazz band. Even those who
aren't intimately familiar with their music
know the tune of "Birdland," the hit sin
gle he wrote for the mega album Heavy
Weather (1977). Mention his name, and
the response tends to be, "Zawin what?",
except from those jazz afficionados who
know to rank him with Miles Davis, Dave
Brubeck and a handful of other modern
jazz masters.
That's o.k. with Joe. He would much
rather be a musician-artist than a musi
cian -celebrity. Born in a Slavic town of 58
people in rural Austria, he's never left his
roots, emotionally or intellectually. Dia
lects, his first solo album since co-found
ing Weather Report with Wayne Shorter,
reflects his respect for farm people and
their folk music, whether from Austria,
Africa, Asia or Australia.
On a recent sunny California morning,
Zawinful sipped coffee poolside at his
Pasadena home on a hill overlooking the
Rose Bowl. His house reflects his person
ality: down to earth, more comfortable
than hip, pets everywhere.
He shared his thoughts on his album,
the impending break up of Weather Re
port, sting as a jazz artist, roc k 'n' roll, the
future ol jazz and the recording industry.
CHG. Why did you decide to make a
solo album now?
JZ-. I've wanted to make this album for
15 years, but my work with Weather Re
port always precluded it. When you put
out an album, sometimes two albums, ev
ery year, there just isn't time. Several of
the songs, though, I had written many
years ago. It only took me two months to
put it together. With Wayne [Shorter] do
ing his own album, it finally gave me an
opportunity to do mine.
CEG. What's the future for Weather Re
port, now that you and Wayne Shorter are
off on your own?

J/.. Weather Report has a new album
coming out April 15. The band will proba
bly tour between June and November,
but we might have to bury the name.
Wayne has his own band now and isn't
part of Weather Report anymore. Wayne
and I share the copyright for the name, so
we probably can't go under that name. If
we can't, then it's very likely we will call
the band Weather Update.
CHG: What kind of research did you do
to capture the international sound you've
achieved on Dialects?
,/Z: Absolutely none. The album is just
my impression of the many peoples and
places I have visited. I was not trying to
imitate other culture's music. I don't even
know any African or Japanese music. If it
sounds authentic, it's because I'm a good
listener. The music I created was based
more on people's speaking patterns than
anything else.

CEG. I low are jazz and folk related?
To me, jazz is simply improvised
rhythmic music with a heavy folklore
background. Pure jazz is improvisation.
All of Dialects is improvised; in fact, two
of the tunes, "The Harvest" and "Zee
Bop," are total improvisation—com
posed, played and recorded simulta
neously. And all the others were impro
vised, but the sound of the original
improvisation was not good enough, so I
recorded them again. There was no mas
ter blueprint to the album. That would
take the pure soul away. That would be
like try ing to prepare yourself to tell a girl
you love her. I low do you practice some
thing like that?
CEG. Mow has rock n' roll affected
your music?
J'/.. To be perfectly honest, rock has
never had any effect on my music, aes
thetically. Certainly, there have been
great rock musicians. Jimi Hendrix
comes immediately to mind. But Weather
Report was not influenced by them.
We're really a traditional jazz band, in the
sense of Ellington and Louis Armstrong,
that continues to explore new territory.
1 grew up as an accordion player, play
ing with gypsies and playing folk music.
Folk music is in my blood and my bones,
and therefore I love jazz. Rock n' roll
used to be great, or at least some of it, but
1 honestly could not name five rock musi
cians that I like, that I consider to be ex
cellent. My kids listen to that stuff, and 1
do like the Talking I leads.
CEG: What do you think of the recent
synthesis of pop and jazz, say, for exam-

pie on Sting's Dream of the Blue Turtles
JZ. I le's more of a jazz musician than a
rock musician. The Police invented their
own brand of music and they've said they
are very influenced by Weather Report. In
one interview, Sting actually said he is try
ing to emulate my vision hut in a song
form with lyrics, etc.
But pop musicians like Sting are so
rare. If I were to work with him, I could
make him into a superior jazz singer. He's
got a great voice, number one. He's got
really good rhythm concepts, he's a musi
cian—a good bass player and he's got
confidence. All the ingredients are there.
CllG. What's holding jazz back from
reaching a wider audience?
