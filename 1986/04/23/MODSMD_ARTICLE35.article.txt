# TOP GUN
## 
### JIMMY SUMMERS 
When the time came to cast the part of
Maverick Mitchell, the best young
Navy pilot in the air, the producers of
Top Gun had only one actor in mind.
That was Tom Cruise. With relatively few roles to
his credit, Cruise has become one of the most
sought after and popular young performers in mo
tion pictures.

From his first appearance on screen in
Taps, Cruise had a certain something that
made him stand out from the rest of the
crowd. By the time he starred in Risky
business, dancing in his underwear to the
music of Bob Seger, the world knew it
had a new star. Certain people just can't
be held back from achieving success, and
it seemed obvious that Cruise was one of
those special people.
Now Cruise is playing a character that
might be described in just the same way.
Lt. Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is also a
golden boy, but he's a golden boy of the
sky. He's an F 14 fighter pilot who's been
selectively chosen to participate in the
Navy's prestigious Fighter Weapons
School, or as it is known to the pilots, the
Top Gun program.
The few who are privileged to be Top
Gun students are chosen from the Navy's
top air crews. Because the Navy's F 14 pi
lots already represent the best the Navy
has to offer, the Top Gunners are the best
of the best, the excelling elite. After an

intensive program that includes simulat
ed in air dogfights and hours of class
room study, the Top Gun graduates re
turn to their commands and share their
new expertise with the other crews in
their squadron.
These aerial cowboys are a special

breed, a description most readily sup
ported by the pilots. During the produc
tion of Tup Gun, Tom Cruise met many a
Top Gunner and one of them summed up
his slightly immodest attitude about his
line of work by saying "there are only
four occupations worthy of a man: actor,
rock star, jet fighter pilot or President of
the United States." That's not the sort of
statement you get from a shrinking violet.
It's also not an attitude that's overly tol
erant with outsiders. But Tom Cruise
managed nonetheless to earn the pilots'
respect. Said one Top Gun pilot: "Tom
took his role very seriously. He looked
like a pilot, studied like a pilot and some
times even partied like a pilot. Fortunate
ly, for him, he still made the salary of a
movie star."
The pilot Cruise plays in Top Gun is
considered one of the best in the Navy's
program. But Maverick Mitchell is achiev
ing his success without necessarily play
ing by the rules. He prefers to fly by in
stinct, a notion that keeps him in hot

water with his superiors. He may win
more dogfights than any other pilot, but
he's only a few steps away from being
booted out of the program.
Matters are only worsened when he
falls in love with a civilian specialist as
signed to the program. Playing Charlotte
Blackwood, the forbidden love interest,
is Kelly McGillis. You might remember
McGillis from an even more complicated
romance in Witness, when she played the
Amish widow in love with Harrison
Ford's Philadelphia detective
Rounding out the cast are more of Hol
lywood's promising new faces Playing
Maverick's radar intercept officer—his
one partner in the air—is Anthony Ed
wards of Revenge of the Nerds and Got
cha. Playing his chief competition for the
distinction of top Top Gunner is Val Kil
mer of Top Secret!and Real (it nius.
Also in the cast are Tom Skrriitt, play
ing the Top Gun commanding i officer and
Michael Ironsides, playing the lop Gun
instructor. ♦
