Mike Rutherford
As a founding member of Genesis,
guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford
was instrumental in creating the
progressive rock sound of the
'70s. While the band has always operated
as a collective unit, its frontmen, notably
Peter Gabriel and, following his depar
ture, Phil Collins, received the lions'
shares of publicity.
But the success of Mike and the Me
chanics, both the name of his new group
and solo album, has brought Rutherford
into the spotlight.
Mike and the Mechanics is actually
Rutherford's third solo album, but the
first to make a splash in the U.S., largely as
a result of the single, "Silent Running."
The song not only shot up the record
charts but spawned a Number One MTV
video, putting an end to the suggestions

that Genesis was nothing without Phil
Collins.
Still, Rutherford admits he prefers
working in the context of a group rather
than as a solo artist. "This album doesn't
feel like a solo album," he says, "because
I've developed and presented the album
differently; hence the group name: Mike
and the Mechanics. It feels very much
like a group. It's a lot more fun working
with others than on your own."
Most of the album's songs were written
by Rutherford and producer Chris Neal,
whom he credits with choosing the
right material. Genesis co-founder Tony
Banks and Phil Collins co-wrote "A Call
to Arms," an old song Genesis never re
corded that I've always liked." Paul Car
rack and Paul Young (the former lead
singer of the group Sad Cafe, not the Paul
Young of "Everytime You Go Away")
handle the vocals.
Rutherford is currently at work on the
new Genesis album and readying for a
world tour with the group beginning in
September. As if Genesis and Mike and
the Mechanics weren't enough, he is also
working with another band, Virginia
Woolf, which includes Jason Bonham,
the son of the late Led Zeppelin drum
mer. "I like to keep busy," comments
Rutherford .

The* reunion of Led Zeppelin for
"Live Aid" last summer prompted
a flurry of rumors of a possible re
union album by the supergroup.
Those suggestions, hopes and prayers
were extinguished quickly by Robert
Plant and Jimmy Page, the former pursu
ing a successful solo career and the latter
involved with The Firm. But now come
published reports in England that a Led
Zeppelin album will be recorded this
year with Plant, Page and John Paul Jones.
Power Station's Tony Thompson will fill
in for the late John Bonham. The four are
said to be currently rehearsing, with plans
to go into the studio in late April. While
no official announcement has been forth
coming, The Firm has limited its U.S. tour
to only six dates, leaving Page available in
April .. . Miami Vice co-stars Don John
son and Philip Michael Thomas have new
record projects in the works. Johnson's
upcoming solo album will feature songs
by former All man Brothers' Band guitarist
Dickey Betts, who is also working on an
album of his own. Thomas is beginning a
musical based on the age-old blues song
"Staggerlee." He envisions the song first
as the inspiration for a thematic album,
then as a Broadway musical and finally as
a TV movie. Thomas says it will feature
music from the roaring '20s to the '80s. ..

Exene and John Doe of X go to the studio in April
with their band... minus guitarist Billy Zoom.
Mike Rutherford
As a founding member of Genesis,
guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford
was instrumental in creating the
progressive rock sound of the
'70s. While the band has always operated
as a collective unit, its frontmen, notably
Peter Gabriel and, following his depar
ture, Phil Collins, received the lions'
shares of publicity.
But the success of Mike and the Me
chanics, both the name of his new group
and solo album, has brought Rutherford
into the spotlight.
Mike and the Mechanics is actually
Rutherford's third solo album, but the
first to make a splash in the U.S., largely as
a result of the single, "Silent Running."
The song not only shot up the record
charts but spawned a Number One MTV
video, putting an end to the suggestions

that Genesis was nothing without Phil
Collins.
Still, Rutherford admits he prefers
working in the context of a group rather
than as a solo artist. "This album doesn't
feel like a solo album," he says, "because
I've developed and presented the album
differently; hence the group name: Mike
and the Mechanics. It feels very much
like a group. It's a lot more fun working
with others than on your own."
Most of the album's songs were written
by Rutherford and producer Chris Neal,
whom he credits with choosing the
right material. Genesis co-founder Tony
Banks and Phil Collins co-wrote "A Call
to Arms," an old song Genesis never re
corded that I've always liked." Paul Car
rack and Paul Young (the former lead
singer of the group Sad Cafe, not the Paul
Young of "Everytime You Go Away")
handle the vocals.
Rutherford is currently at work on the
new Genesis album and readying for a
world tour with the group beginning in
September. As if Genesis and Mike and
the Mechanics weren't enough, he is also
working with another band, Virginia
Woolf, which includes Jason Bonham,
the son of the late Led Zeppelin drum
mer. "I like to keep busy," comments
Rutherford .

The* reunion of Led Zeppelin for
"Live Aid" last summer prompted
a flurry of rumors of a possible re
union album by the supergroup.
Those suggestions, hopes and prayers
were extinguished quickly by Robert
Plant and Jimmy Page, the former pursu
ing a successful solo career and the latter
involved with The Firm. But now come
published reports in England that a Led
Zeppelin album will be recorded this
year with Plant, Page and John Paul Jones.
Power Station's Tony Thompson will fill
in for the late John Bonham. The four are
said to be currently rehearsing, with plans
to go into the studio in late April. While
no official announcement has been forth
coming, The Firm has limited its U.S. tour
to only six dates, leaving Page available in
April .. . Miami Vice co-stars Don John
son and Philip Michael Thomas have new
record projects in the works. Johnson's
upcoming solo album will feature songs
by former All man Brothers' Band guitarist
Dickey Betts, who is also working on an
album of his own. Thomas is beginning a
musical based on the age-old blues song
"Staggerlee." He envisions the song first
as the inspiration for a thematic album,
then as a Broadway musical and finally as
a TV movie. Thomas says it will feature
music from the roaring '20s to the '80s. ..
