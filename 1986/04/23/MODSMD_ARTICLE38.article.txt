# JOIN HUGHES:
## Making the Movies Young People Love 
### MARK CHRISTENSEN 
Ferris He tiller's Day Off, says John
Hughes, "is about this high school
kid who cuts class and goes to the
big city for the day with his best
friend and girlfriend. Hut, it really is
about personal freedom and how differ
ent things are when you have decided for
just one day to be free."
Hughes, world class creator and cutter
of films ranging from Mr Mom to Sixteen
Candles and The Breakfast Club, is
perched on the edge of a long grey couch
at his offices at Paramount Studios in Hoi
lywood With the exception of Stephen
Spielberg, no recent young filmmaker
has enjoyed such speedy success. During
the past three years or so, his efforts have
made hundreds of millions of dollars and
displayed the comic verve and range of a
Charlie Chaplin or Woody Allen. Just by

making movies about kids.
Some, like The Breakfast Club, are
lightly choreographed, literate ballets.
One or two others, like the National
Lampoon's Summer Vacation, may have
had their most crucial scenes conjured on
the back of a cocktail napkin.
But, mostly, Hughes' work is ambi
tious, smart, riveting and funny. And no
current movie maker is as good at mixing
belly laughs with heart and compassion.
Ferris Beuller is his latest.
"It's about freedom from worry. Ferris
doesn't worry, doesn't sweat anything.
It's also about a change in reality. If
you've ever stayed home from school or
work for reasons other than being sick,
you see how different the world looks."
Hughes looks far less like the stereo
typical tanned Hollywood mogul than,

say, a rather bookish member of an En
glish rock band. Tall. An explosive mane
of long, dark blond hair. Glasses. A black
cloth coat, thoroughly wrinkled silver
slacks and a white shirt with sleeves so
long that his cuffs touch his knuckles.
"I'd much rather be a musician than a
movie maker, but I'm just about tone
deaf. To me, tuning a guitar correctly is
one of the world's major mysteries." Nev
ertheless, his aggressive use of new mu
sic has become a stock in trade. "Simple
Minds sold 50,000 albums until 'Don't
You' broke on Breakfast Club
"Hut there will be a change with the
music on Ferris. What I want to do is use a
big sound, a state of the art production
using edge bands that press the enve
lope—or whatever the space people call
it bands like Zig Zag Sputnik, then,
couple that with a more accessible sound.
"I want to focus my movies on bands
who have the right to be heard by the
great Top Forty masses. New stuff. Be
cause, like, when I go to Chicago, I listen
to three stations and get nothing but San
tana and 'Layla.' It's like somebody fell
asleep on the 1972 button."
A former writer for National Lampoon,
Hughes left the magazine several years
ago to write what are popularly perceived
as "teen flicks," a realm previously domi
nated by big breasts, beer drinking and
fart jokes. His efforts (usually) to elevate
the genre have made for films that re
create adolescence with an energy, in
ventiveness and exactitude that can be
drop dead eerie.
Who can forget Anthony Michael Hall
in Sixteen Candles, the kid with the spi
dery hands and concave chest who, while
wooing Molly Ringwald, allows, some
what parenthetically, that his social status
in the school is insured by the fact that he
is "king of the dipshits." Or, later, when
Ik- wakes after a drunken night of evident
debauchery and devirginizing with his
high school's brassiest sexpot, the new,
rather blithely unanchored Hall asking
her, "Did I enjoy it?"

Hughes' enthusiasm for these kinds of
shenanigans is surprising in light of the
fact thai his own adolescent experience
was not idylic. "In high school, 1 was a
serious outcast, a laughingstock. I took it.
I took it and I thought, 'I'll show you; I'll
show you.' This was, like, in 1967
"I went to a jock-y school. We had a
serious dress code. I almost didn't gradu
ate, because my hair touched my collar."
"Back then, 1 wanted to be Picasso, Mi
chelangelo, James Joyce or Hob Dylan.
That's where I took my solace People
would make fun of me, and I d think,
'That's okay. Picasso would like me.' I'd
come home at night, and I'd sit at my win
dow and put on my albums and read my
British music magazines. I didn't want to
belong, because I couldn't belong.
"The guy who was the teacher in
Breakfast C.luh was my gym teacher He
didn't like me because of my hair, so he
flunked me senior year in gym, which
meant, to graduate, I had to take double
gym and health. You know, sit in class
and look at VI) ravaged genitals and slide
shows about how to brush your teeth
Were other characters in his films taken
directly from experience? "Yeah The
jerk rich kid in Pretty in Pink. I had a guy
like him haunt me all the way through
high school. Money to burn. His older
brother had an Alfa, the big nice one, and
parked it outside with the top down in the
rain. I would walk by and see the rose
wood buckling on the dash. I couldn t un
derstand how kids could live like thai I
just wasn't part of that world."
And college was scarcely an impi ve
ment. "I hated it intensely. I was .'nor
mously homesick and felt completely
displaced ... I went to college in Ar '.o
na, a big party school, a big fraternity
school. The ami war movement was v y
small, and the cops were very tough
"I was desperately in love will ay
wife, who was then my girlfriend . Slu . is
still in high school. I spent $1,000 -ist
semester just on phone bills.
"1 had problems with the social n. e

of the school. I wasn't a fraternity type.
And 1 had a knack for attracting hostile
authority figures. I mean, during the Rev
olutionary War I would have been over at
Tom Payne's house saying, 'Hey, let's get
some boats, cross the Atlantic and make
them live under US for a while'." Finally,
after two or three and a half years, Hughes
got a belly full of academia and, on hear
ing John I.ennon's"Working Class Hero",
decided to head back home.
Conditions did not improve immedi
ately "Nancy and I—she was 20, I was
21— lived in a converted boxcar. The rent
was only $110 a month. But, we couldn't
make it and ended up living in my par
ents' basement for eight months." But
things got better. After failing the'writing
tests"of half the ad agencies in Chicago,
he got a job at Leo Burnett where he final
ly found a niche.
"I went to work in the day and came
home in the dark. I started at $8,500 a
year, doubled my salary within six
months and doubled it again a year after
that. I just kept eating up bosses. One
time the guy above me did an ad the com
pany didn't like. I asked for a shot at it and
stayed up all night doing sixteen varia
lions on the idea I had. They liked one
and, the next thing I knew, I had his job. I
was a creative director at 25 or 26."
Then came National Lampoon, where
Hughes filled upwards of 120 magazine
pages a year with stories like "Sexual Har
rassment: How to Do It." The rest, as they

say, is history.
So, has success changed John Hughes?
Evidently, not much. Hughes still spends
as much time as possible back home in
Chicago. "I still own a house there. I just
put a new roof on it, so, if there are winos
living there while I'm gone, they won't
get wet. I don't mix much socially out
here. I've only gone to iwo so-called
'Hollywood' parties in my life, one be
cause P.J. O'Rourke made me, and the
other because it was an MTV premiere for
Pretty in Pink."
Big Money doesn't seem to interest
him either. "I've got a business manager I
haven't seen in a year and a half. Basically,
I know I'm better off now because I can
afford to buy lots more records."
But what about the future? "I'd like to
have my own building, my own opera
tion. I'm not that nuts about movie lots.
I'd like to write a book, maybe a novel,
but I don't think I've mastered that form
yet. I'd love to do some 9,000 page thing.
"I've got another film scheduled to
start shooting this summer, Some Kind of
Wonderful. It's college, my first foray into
college. It's about the difference between
the first year and the last, the struggle for
dignity and identity.
"Right now, I'm making two movies a
year with very direct involvement. But I
could do three a year, produce two and
direct one. The thing is, I've got a million
ideas. It's choosing which ones to exe
cute that's tough."


"In high school, I was a
serioos autcast,...
People wonld make fen
of me ead I'd thlok,
'That's ohay. Picasso
woold like me'."

Ferris He tiller's Day Off, says John
Hughes, "is about this high school
kid who cuts class and goes to the
big city for the day with his best
friend and girlfriend. Hut, it really is
about personal freedom and how differ
ent things are when you have decided for
just one day to be free."
Hughes, world class creator and cutter
of films ranging from Mr Mom to Sixteen
Candles and The Breakfast Club, is
perched on the edge of a long grey couch
at his offices at Paramount Studios in Hoi
lywood With the exception of Stephen
Spielberg, no recent young filmmaker
has enjoyed such speedy success. During
the past three years or so, his efforts have
made hundreds of millions of dollars and
displayed the comic verve and range of a
Charlie Chaplin or Woody Allen. Just by

making movies about kids.
Some, like The Breakfast Club, are
lightly choreographed, literate ballets.
One or two others, like the National
Lampoon's Summer Vacation, may have
had their most crucial scenes conjured on
the back of a cocktail napkin.
But, mostly, Hughes' work is ambi
tious, smart, riveting and funny. And no
current movie maker is as good at mixing
belly laughs with heart and compassion.
Ferris Beuller is his latest.
"It's about freedom from worry. Ferris
doesn't worry, doesn't sweat anything.
It's also about a change in reality. If
you've ever stayed home from school or
work for reasons other than being sick,
you see how different the world looks."
Hughes looks far less like the stereo
typical tanned Hollywood mogul than,

say, a rather bookish member of an En
glish rock band. Tall. An explosive mane
of long, dark blond hair. Glasses. A black
cloth coat, thoroughly wrinkled silver
slacks and a white shirt with sleeves so
long that his cuffs touch his knuckles.
"I'd much rather be a musician than a
movie maker, but I'm just about tone
deaf. To me, tuning a guitar correctly is
one of the world's major mysteries." Nev
ertheless, his aggressive use of new mu
sic has become a stock in trade. "Simple
Minds sold 50,000 albums until 'Don't
You' broke on Breakfast Club
"Hut there will be a change with the
music on Ferris. What I want to do is use a
big sound, a state of the art production
using edge bands that press the enve
lope—or whatever the space people call
it bands like Zig Zag Sputnik, then,
couple that with a more accessible sound.
"I want to focus my movies on bands
who have the right to be heard by the
great Top Forty masses. New stuff. Be
cause, like, when I go to Chicago, I listen
to three stations and get nothing but San
tana and 'Layla.' It's like somebody fell
asleep on the 1972 button."
A former writer for National Lampoon,
Hughes left the magazine several years
ago to write what are popularly perceived
as "teen flicks," a realm previously domi
nated by big breasts, beer drinking and
fart jokes. His efforts (usually) to elevate
the genre have made for films that re
create adolescence with an energy, in
ventiveness and exactitude that can be
drop dead eerie.
Who can forget Anthony Michael Hall
in Sixteen Candles, the kid with the spi
dery hands and concave chest who, while
wooing Molly Ringwald, allows, some
what parenthetically, that his social status
in the school is insured by the fact that he
is "king of the dipshits." Or, later, when
Ik- wakes after a drunken night of evident
debauchery and devirginizing with his
high school's brassiest sexpot, the new,
rather blithely unanchored Hall asking
her, "Did I enjoy it?"

Hughes' enthusiasm for these kinds of
shenanigans is surprising in light of the
fact thai his own adolescent experience
was not idylic. "In high school, 1 was a
serious outcast, a laughingstock. I took it.
I took it and I thought, 'I'll show you; I'll
show you.' This was, like, in 1967
"I went to a jock-y school. We had a
serious dress code. I almost didn't gradu
ate, because my hair touched my collar."
"Back then, 1 wanted to be Picasso, Mi
chelangelo, James Joyce or Hob Dylan.
That's where I took my solace People
would make fun of me, and I d think,
'That's okay. Picasso would like me.' I'd
come home at night, and I'd sit at my win
dow and put on my albums and read my
British music magazines. I didn't want to
belong, because I couldn't belong.
"The guy who was the teacher in
Breakfast C.luh was my gym teacher He
didn't like me because of my hair, so he
flunked me senior year in gym, which
meant, to graduate, I had to take double
gym and health. You know, sit in class
and look at VI) ravaged genitals and slide
shows about how to brush your teeth
Were other characters in his films taken
directly from experience? "Yeah The
jerk rich kid in Pretty in Pink. I had a guy
like him haunt me all the way through
high school. Money to burn. His older
brother had an Alfa, the big nice one, and
parked it outside with the top down in the
rain. I would walk by and see the rose
wood buckling on the dash. I couldn t un
derstand how kids could live like thai I
just wasn't part of that world."
And college was scarcely an impi ve
ment. "I hated it intensely. I was .'nor
mously homesick and felt completely
displaced ... I went to college in Ar '.o
na, a big party school, a big fraternity
school. The ami war movement was v y
small, and the cops were very tough
"I was desperately in love will ay

of the school. I wasn't a fraternity type.
And 1 had a knack for attracting hostile
authority figures. I mean, during the Rev
olutionary War I would have been over at
Tom Payne's house saying, 'Hey, let's get
some boats, cross the Atlantic and make
them live under US for a while'." Finally,
after two or three and a half years, Hughes
got a belly full of academia and, on hear
ing John I.ennon's"Working Class Hero",
decided to head back home.
Conditions did not improve immedi
ately "Nancy and I—she was 20, I was
21— lived in a converted boxcar. The rent
was only $110 a month. But, we couldn't
make it and ended up living in my par
ents' basement for eight months." But
things got better. After failing the'writing
tests"of half the ad agencies in Chicago,
he got a job at Leo Burnett where he final
ly found a niche.
"I went to work in the day and came
home in the dark. I started at $8,500 a
year, doubled my salary within six
months and doubled it again a year after
that. I just kept eating up bosses. One
time the guy above me did an ad the com
pany didn't like. I asked for a shot at it and
stayed up all night doing sixteen varia
lions on the idea I had. They liked one
and, the next thing I knew, I had his job. I
was a creative director at 25 or 26."
Then came National Lampoon, where
Hughes filled upwards of 120 magazine
pages a year with stories like "Sexual Har
rassment: How to Do It." The rest, as they

say, is history.
So, has success changed John Hughes?
Evidently, not much. Hughes still spends
as much time as possible back home in
Chicago. "I still own a house there. I just
put a new roof on it, so, if there are winos
living there while I'm gone, they won't
get wet. I don't mix much socially out
here. I've only gone to iwo so-called
'Hollywood' parties in my life, one be
cause P.J. O'Rourke made me, and the
other because it was an MTV premiere for
Pretty in Pink."
Big Money doesn't seem to interest
him either. "I've got a business manager I
haven't seen in a year and a half. Basically,
I know I'm better off now because I can
afford to buy lots more records."
But what about the future? "I'd like to
have my own building, my own opera
tion. I'm not that nuts about movie lots.
I'd like to write a book, maybe a novel,
but I don't think I've mastered that form
yet. I'd love to do some 9,000 page thing.
"I've got another film scheduled to
start shooting this summer, Some Kind of
Wonderful. It's college, my first foray into
college. It's about the difference between
the first year and the last, the struggle for
dignity and identity.
"Right now, I'm making two movies a
year with very direct involvement. But I
could do three a year, produce two and
direct one. The thing is, I've got a million
ideas. It's choosing which ones to exe
cute that's tough."


"In high school, I was a
serioos autcast,...
People wonld make fen
of me ead I'd thlok,
'That's ohay. Picasso
woold like me'."

Ferris He tiller's Day Off, says John
Hughes, "is about this high school
kid who cuts class and goes to the
big city for the day with his best
friend and girlfriend. Hut, it really is
about personal freedom and how differ
ent things are when you have decided for
just one day to be free."
Hughes, world class creator and cutter
of films ranging from Mr Mom to Sixteen
Candles and The Breakfast Club, is
perched on the edge of a long grey couch
at his offices at Paramount Studios in Hoi
lywood With the exception of Stephen
Spielberg, no recent young filmmaker
has enjoyed such speedy success. During
the past three years or so, his efforts have
made hundreds of millions of dollars and
displayed the comic verve and range of a
Charlie Chaplin or Woody Allen. Just by

making movies about kids.
Some, like The Breakfast Club, are
lightly choreographed, literate ballets.
One or two others, like the National
Lampoon's Summer Vacation, may have
had their most crucial scenes conjured on
the back of a cocktail napkin.
But, mostly, Hughes' work is ambi
tious, smart, riveting and funny. And no
current movie maker is as good at mixing
belly laughs with heart and compassion.
Ferris Beuller is his latest.
"It's about freedom from worry. Ferris
doesn't worry, doesn't sweat anything.
It's also about a change in reality. If
you've ever stayed home from school or
work for reasons other than being sick,
you see how different the world looks."
Hughes looks far less like the stereo
typical tanned Hollywood mogul than,

say, a rather bookish member of an En
glish rock band. Tall. An explosive mane
of long, dark blond hair. Glasses. A black
cloth coat, thoroughly wrinkled silver
slacks and a white shirt with sleeves so
long that his cuffs touch his knuckles.
"I'd much rather be a musician than a
movie maker, but I'm just about tone
deaf. To me, tuning a guitar correctly is
one of the world's major mysteries." Nev
ertheless, his aggressive use of new mu
sic has become a stock in trade. "Simple
Minds sold 50,000 albums until 'Don't
You' broke on Breakfast Club
"Hut there will be a change with the
music on Ferris. What I want to do is use a
big sound, a state of the art production
using edge bands that press the enve
lope—or whatever the space people call
it bands like Zig Zag Sputnik, then,
couple that with a more accessible sound.
"I want to focus my movies on bands
who have the right to be heard by the
great Top Forty masses. New stuff. Be
cause, like, when I go to Chicago, I listen
to three stations and get nothing but San
tana and 'Layla.' It's like somebody fell
asleep on the 1972 button."
A former writer for National Lampoon,
Hughes left the magazine several years
ago to write what are popularly perceived
as "teen flicks," a realm previously domi
nated by big breasts, beer drinking and
fart jokes. His efforts (usually) to elevate
the genre have made for films that re
create adolescence with an energy, in
ventiveness and exactitude that can be
drop dead eerie.
Who can forget Anthony Michael Hall
in Sixteen Candles, the kid with the spi
dery hands and concave chest who, while
wooing Molly Ringwald, allows, some
what parenthetically, that his social status
in the school is insured by the fact that he
is "king of the dipshits." Or, later, when
Ik- wakes after a drunken night of evident
debauchery and devirginizing with his
high school's brassiest sexpot, the new,
rather blithely unanchored Hall asking
her, "Did I enjoy it?"

Hughes' enthusiasm for these kinds of
shenanigans is surprising in light of the
fact thai his own adolescent experience
was not idylic. "In high school, 1 was a
serious outcast, a laughingstock. I took it.
I took it and I thought, 'I'll show you; I'll
show you.' This was, like, in 1967
"I went to a jock-y school. We had a
serious dress code. I almost didn't gradu
ate, because my hair touched my collar."
"Back then, 1 wanted to be Picasso, Mi
chelangelo, James Joyce or Hob Dylan.
That's where I took my solace People
would make fun of me, and I d think,
'That's okay. Picasso would like me.' I'd
come home at night, and I'd sit at my win
dow and put on my albums and read my
British music magazines. I didn't want to
belong, because I couldn't belong.
"The guy who was the teacher in
Breakfast C.luh was my gym teacher He
didn't like me because of my hair, so he
flunked me senior year in gym, which
meant, to graduate, I had to take double
gym and health. You know, sit in class
and look at VI) ravaged genitals and slide
shows about how to brush your teeth
Were other characters in his films taken
directly from experience? "Yeah The
jerk rich kid in Pretty in Pink. I had a guy
like him haunt me all the way through
high school. Money to burn. His older
brother had an Alfa, the big nice one, and
parked it outside with the top down in the
rain. I would walk by and see the rose
wood buckling on the dash. I couldn t un
derstand how kids could live like thai I
just wasn't part of that world."
And college was scarcely an impi ve
ment. "I hated it intensely. I was .'nor
mously homesick and felt completely
displaced ... I went to college in Ar '.o
na, a big party school, a big fraternity
school. The ami war movement was v y
small, and the cops were very tough
"I was desperately in love will ay
wife, who was then my girlfriend . Slu . is
still in high school. I spent $1,000 -ist
semester just on phone bills.
"1 had problems with the social n. e

of the school. I wasn't a fraternity type.
And 1 had a knack for attracting hostile
authority figures. I mean, during the Rev
olutionary War I would have been over at
Tom Payne's house saying, 'Hey, let's get
some boats, cross the Atlantic and make
them live under US for a while'." Finally,
after two or three and a half years, Hughes
got a belly full of academia and, on hear
ing John I.ennon's"Working Class Hero",
decided to head back home.
Conditions did not improve immedi
ately "Nancy and I—she was 20, I was
21— lived in a converted boxcar. The rent
was only $110 a month. But, we couldn't
make it and ended up living in my par
ents' basement for eight months." But
things got better. After failing the'writing
tests"of half the ad agencies in Chicago,
he got a job at Leo Burnett where he final
ly found a niche.
"I went to work in the day and came
home in the dark. I started at $8,500 a
year, doubled my salary within six
months and doubled it again a year after
that. I just kept eating up bosses. One
time the guy above me did an ad the com
pany didn't like. I asked for a shot at it and
stayed up all night doing sixteen varia
lions on the idea I had. They liked one
and, the next thing I knew, I had his job. I
was a creative director at 25 or 26."
Then came National Lampoon, where
Hughes filled upwards of 120 magazine
pages a year with stories like "Sexual Har
rassment: How to Do It." The rest, as they

say, is history.
So, has success changed John Hughes?
Evidently, not much. Hughes still spends
as much time as possible back home in
Chicago. "I still own a house there. I just
put a new roof on it, so, if there are winos
living there while I'm gone, they won't
get wet. I don't mix much socially out
here. I've only gone to iwo so-called
'Hollywood' parties in my life, one be
cause P.J. O'Rourke made me, and the
other because it was an MTV premiere for
Pretty in Pink."
Big Money doesn't seem to interest
him either. "I've got a business manager I
haven't seen in a year and a half. Basically,
I know I'm better off now because I can
afford to buy lots more records."
But what about the future? "I'd like to
have my own building, my own opera
tion. I'm not that nuts about movie lots.
I'd like to write a book, maybe a novel,
but I don't think I've mastered that form
yet. I'd love to do some 9,000 page thing.
"I've got another film scheduled to
start shooting this summer, Some Kind of
Wonderful. It's college, my first foray into
college. It's about the difference between
the first year and the last, the struggle for
dignity and identity.
"Right now, I'm making two movies a
year with very direct involvement. But I
could do three a year, produce two and
direct one. The thing is, I've got a million
ideas. It's choosing which ones to exe
cute that's tough."
