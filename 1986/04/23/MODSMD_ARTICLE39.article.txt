A FINE MESS
Laurel and Hardy would be pleased.
The bumbling silliness of the his
toric comic duo is the inspiration
for director Blake Edwards' new
film, A Fine Mess, starring Ted Danson
and Howie Mandel as two equally bum
bling ne'er-do-wells.
Laurel and Hardy would seem to be a
natural for the director who, with Peter
Sellers, created the modern master of
bumble, Inspector Clouseau, in the Pink
Panther films. Indeed, "They were
Blake's favorite comedy team," com
mented co-star Mandel.
Although loosely based on a classic
short by the comic legends, A Fine Mess,
"is more of an homage," said Mandel. "It

was originally called The Music Box,
which was the famous laurel and Hardy
short with them trying to get a piano up a
(light of stairs. But this movie is a com
pletely original story It's very physical
comedy, wacky, with chases—l guess it
has a little piece of every one of their
movies in that sense."
"I play Dennis Powell, a roller skating
hamburger stand waiter who's been
working his whole life to save up for his
own fast-food restaurant. Ted Danson
plays his buddy, a movie extra whose
dream is to become a big star. This story is
about the "fine mess" he (Danson) gets
us into when he sees something he's not
supposed to see."

BIG TROUBLE
IN LITTLE CHINA
Welcome to dinner in China
town in John Carpenter's Big
Trouble in Little China Alter
you finish the tea and the dim
sum, how about a stroll through the un
derworld, with such exotic attractions as
the "Room of the Upside-Down Hell" the
"Honorable Hall of the Infernal Judge?"
You'll know you're in big trouble when
you bump into Jack Burton (Kurt Russell)
and his pig hauling truck, the Pork Chop
Express. Jack is helping his friend Wang
Chi (Dennis Dun) recover his lost green
eyed bride kidnapped by Lo Pan (James
Hong) and his fiendish thugs.
Aided by Grade I.aw, a sensuous attor
ney played by Kim Cattral, and Egg Shen
(Victor Wong), a clairvoyant bus driver,
Jack and Wang enter an imaginary under
world ruled by Lo Pan According to leg
end, Lo Ran is a cold-blooded spirit im
prisoned in hell by the First Emperor of
China, who can only regain his virility by
coupling with that one in a million
green-eyed woman.
Pretty kinky, huh? Big Trouble starts off
as an action adventure-comedy, shifts
into high gear as bizarre circumstances
mount and winds up as a kung fu-mon
ster-ghost story. Whew!
"It's an ensemble piece, and it's very
complex," says Carpenter, who is famous
for his low-budget, gripping thrillers like
Halloween and Christine.
However, Hig Trouble is a $25 million
production, filmed mostly in Los Angeles
with a great deal of special effects from
fiery explosives to an 8 foot human skull
which emits eerily colored smoke.
But stripped of its haunting facade, the
basic premise of Hig Trouble is still good
guys versus bad guys. This ancient tradi
tion of story telling "goes back to the
days of lllysses and Shakespeare," Car
penter says. And, though it may sound
simplistic, Carpenter believes that's the
key to every one of his films: sheer fun
intertwined with subtle messages.

BACK TO SCHOOL
M movie's hard," says Rod
ney Dangerfield, his long
mm doleful face looking more
■ M sorrowful than ever.
"When you're telling jokes to a camera,
you don't get much of a response. Know
what 1 mean?" It's not much solace to ;i
man who's used to making millions laugh
that the cameraman and the boom opera
tor are trying to keep from falling down
with laughter while filming Hack to
School, Dangerfield's latest movie.
"They're laughing because they
weren't expecting that," says director
Alan Metier. "Rodney makes up material
all the time. I leave at the end of the day,
exhausted from shooting. He goes home
to polish jokes and continue to work.
In Hack to School, Dangerfield plays a
self made millionaire who signs on as a
freshman at college in order to help his
shy son through a bad time. It's a comedy
of errors with Dangerfield triumphing in
spite of himself amid the usual comple
ment of rapid-fire one liners.

Ted Danson (right)
and Howie Mandel
play sidekicks down
or their luck in A Fine
Mess, a zany comedy
inspired by a classic
Laurel and Hardy
short.

John Carpenter turns his weird sensibilities to Chinatown in Big Trouble in Little China. Kurt Russell (second
from right) stars as an adventurer who helps a friend (Dennis Dunn, second from left) find his kidnapped wife.



Will Rodney Dangerfield (left) finally get some re
spect? Maybe in his new film, Back to School,
where he plays a businessman who goes back to
college.

supposed to see."

BIG TROUBLE
IN LITTLE CHINA
Welcome to dinner in China
town in John Carpenter's Big
Trouble in Little China Alter
you finish the tea and the dim
sum, how about a stroll through the un
derworld, with such exotic attractions as
the "Room of the Upside-Down Hell" the
"Honorable Hall of the Infernal Judge?"
You'll know you're in big trouble when
you bump into Jack Burton (Kurt Russell)
and his pig hauling truck, the Pork Chop
Express. Jack is helping his friend Wang
Chi (Dennis Dun) recover his lost green
eyed bride kidnapped by Lo Pan (James
Hong) and his fiendish thugs.
Aided by Grade I.aw, a sensuous attor
ney played by Kim Cattral, and Egg Shen
(Victor Wong), a clairvoyant bus driver,
Jack and Wang enter an imaginary under
world ruled by Lo Pan According to leg
end, Lo Ran is a cold-blooded spirit im
prisoned in hell by the First Emperor of
China, who can only regain his virility by
coupling with that one in a million
green-eyed woman.
Pretty kinky, huh? Big Trouble starts off
as an action adventure-comedy, shifts
into high gear as bizarre circumstances
mount and winds up as a kung fu-mon
ster-ghost story. Whew!
"It's an ensemble piece, and it's very
complex," says Carpenter, who is famous
for his low-budget, gripping thrillers like
Halloween and Christine.
However, Hig Trouble is a $25 million
production, filmed mostly in Los Angeles
with a great deal of special effects from
fiery explosives to an 8 foot human skull
which emits eerily colored smoke.
But stripped of its haunting facade, the
basic premise of Hig Trouble is still good
guys versus bad guys. This ancient tradi
tion of story telling "goes back to the
days of lllysses and Shakespeare," Car
penter says. And, though it may sound
simplistic, Carpenter believes that's the
key to every one of his films: sheer fun
intertwined with subtle messages.

BACK TO SCHOOL
M movie's hard," says Rod
ney Dangerfield, his long
mm doleful face looking more
■ M sorrowful than ever.
"When you're telling jokes to a camera,
you don't get much of a response. Know
what 1 mean?" It's not much solace to ;i
man who's used to making millions laugh
that the cameraman and the boom opera
tor are trying to keep from falling down
with laughter while filming Hack to
School, Dangerfield's latest movie.
"They're laughing because they
weren't expecting that," says director
Alan Metier. "Rodney makes up material
all the time. I leave at the end of the day,
exhausted from shooting. He goes home
to polish jokes and continue to work.
In Hack to School, Dangerfield plays a
self made millionaire who signs on as a
freshman at college in order to help his
shy son through a bad time. It's a comedy
of errors with Dangerfield triumphing in
spite of himself amid the usual comple
ment of rapid-fire one liners.

Ted Danson (right)
and Howie Mandel
play sidekicks down
or their luck in A Fine
Mess, a zany comedy
inspired by a classic
Laurel and Hardy
short.

John Carpenter turns his weird sensibilities to Chinatown in Big Trouble in Little China. Kurt Russell (second
from right) stars as an adventurer who helps a friend (Dennis Dunn, second from left) find his kidnapped wife.



Will Rodney Dangerfield (left) finally get some re
spect? Maybe in his new film, Back to School,
where he plays a businessman who goes back to
college.
A FINE MESS
Laurel and Hardy would be pleased.
The bumbling silliness of the his
toric comic duo is the inspiration
for director Blake Edwards' new
film, A Fine Mess, starring Ted Danson
and Howie Mandel as two equally bum
bling ne'er-do-wells.
Laurel and Hardy would seem to be a
natural for the director who, with Peter
Sellers, created the modern master of
bumble, Inspector Clouseau, in the Pink
Panther films. Indeed, "They were
Blake's favorite comedy team," com
mented co-star Mandel.
Although loosely based on a classic
short by the comic legends, A Fine Mess,
"is more of an homage," said Mandel. "It

was originally called The Music Box,
which was the famous laurel and Hardy
short with them trying to get a piano up a
(light of stairs. But this movie is a com
pletely original story It's very physical
comedy, wacky, with chases—l guess it
has a little piece of every one of their
movies in that sense."
"I play Dennis Powell, a roller skating
hamburger stand waiter who's been
working his whole life to save up for his
own fast-food restaurant. Ted Danson
plays his buddy, a movie extra whose
dream is to become a big star. This story is
about the "fine mess" he (Danson) gets
us into when he sees something he's not
supposed to see."
