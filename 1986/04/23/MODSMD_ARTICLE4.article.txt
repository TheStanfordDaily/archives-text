## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
Eric Diesel, one of 23 apartheid
protesters arrested at Old Union sit-ins in
October, was found guilty in a jury trial
yesterday of trespassing, unlawful assem
bly and refusal to disperse at an Oct. 1 1
demonstration.
However, the jury did not find Diesel,
the only Stanford demonstrator to go to
trial and the last to be sentenced, guilty of
similar charges stemming from an Oct. 14
demonstration. The jury remained hung
after several revotes as to the guilt of Die
sel on this second date, voting 9-3. 10-2

and 8-4 in favor of Diesel's aquittal.
Diesel, a doctoral candidate in statistics,
was the only protester arrested at the sit
ins to plead "not guilty" to the eharges.
Nineteen students, one professor and a
Palo Alto resident pleaded no contest to
trespassing charges in pre-trial proceedings
last Thursday. Another student pleaded
guilty.
"I still feel that I'm innocent. I'm sure
that all the demonstrators were innocent,"
he said.
Diesel said he believed the other dem
onstrators had pleaded no contest to
similar charges because the court had
given them no other reasonable option for

expressing their innocence.
"They had the choice of spending two
nights in jail or three long weeks in court,"
he said. "So the punishment for their
maintaining their innocence was worse
than the punishment for pleading guilty."
Diesel chose to waive his right to legal
council and represented himself during the
trial. " I felt that this trial was about the re
lationship between Stanford and the South
African government," he said. "1 feel that
I was better able to discuss that relation
ship then a lawyer who would be making a
technical legal argument."
Diesel will be sentenced at 1:30 p.m.
today at the Palo Alto Municipal Court

house by Judge Franklin Elia, who
presided over all the Stanford protesters'
trials.
Peter Waite, the deputy district attorney
who conducted the case against Diesel for
the county, said."l'm sure (Diesel) will be
given the same type of sentence that the
other demonstrators were, but he certainly
has the right to appeal."
Last week Elia handed down sentences
ranging from four days in custody to 20
hours of community service.
Waite added that he would
"undoubtedly excercise the DA's option to
dismiss the charges that the jury could not
reach a verdict on."
