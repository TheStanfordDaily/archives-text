THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS
Just when you thought it was safe to
go back to the greenhouse ... along
comes The Little Shop Of Horrors,
with Audrey 11, its people eating
plant. Director Frank Oz (of Muppets
fame) says cheerfully, "By the time we're
finished, the entire cast is eaten. I know a
lot of directors will envy that."
You probably would love Audrey 11, if
you could see her, but, until the movie is
released, she's being kept under wraps.
"All I can say is she sings, she dances, she
dials the phone, and she eats people,"
says Lyle Conway, her designer. Those
who have seen her say she starts out small
and sexy, and, fed human beings, grows
to truly huge proportions.
Audrey II first proved her popularity in
the original Little Shop, a low budget
Roger Corman film made 25 years ago.
("We spent $40,000 on ours," says Cor
man ruefully. "This one is $20 million.")
Four years ago, Little Shop of Horrors was
resurrected as an offoff Broadway musi
cal comedy Its success encouraged
Warner Bros, to reprise it on film.
"It's not a big, splashy Hollywood mu
sical," says Henson. "The music is an in
tegral part of the story and moves the plot
forward. We haven't opened up the plot
so much as we've enriched it."
The action takes place in Mushnick's
Flower Shop in a rundown part of town.
Seymour (Rick Moranis), a nerdy floral
assistant, buys a strange little plant and
names it for his girlfriend Audrey.
Having no awe of the Hollywood star
system, the plant snacks happily on cast
members Steve Guttenberg, Bill Murray,
Raul Dooley, Vincent Gardenia, et al—
though not necessarily in that order.

M M A ■ one of us could wait to get

Twiggy, who stars with
I Robin Williams and Peter
O'Toole in Harold Ramis' (Ghosthusters)
new film Club Paradise.
"I had just come from a film set in Fng
land, where it was freezing cold," said the
actress and former model who set the
style for London's swinging sixties."We
all were so glad to be in the sun, we
would have played the phone book. As it
turned out, it was a very, very funny script,
so we were lucky in all ways."
Club I'aradise is a comic mixture of ro
mance, revolution and seedy resorts,
written by Ramis. "It also includes a
smarmy Fnglishman, which I play," says
Simon Jones (Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, Rrideshead Revisited). "It's a

small but nasty part, and I liked playing it,
especially in Jamaica.
"Robin Williams plays the good guy.
I le's a fireman from Chicago who wisely
decides he's had enough of cold and
snow and fighting fires. He comes to Par
adise, where he not so wisely decides to
invest in a rundown resort hotel with Jim
my Cliff, who is having trouble with the
local corrupt politicos. Along the way,
Robin manages to attract the cook and
first mate of my yacht to his enterprise.
Since the mate is Twiggy, you can under
stand my deep resentment."
There's Peter O'Toole's sun-drenched
Governor General, who hates to have his
cushy life disturbed. And there's his girl
112 riend, a travel writer who wants to report
on world events and sees her destiny in
an island revolution.
"In fact, things were so complicated,"
says Simon Jones, "that Harold was the
only one who knew what was going
on." — Joan Goodman
ALIENS
A summer film promising to be a
special effects extravaganza is
Aliens, sequel to 1979's monster
hit, Alien. It brings back Sigour
ney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, sole survivor
(with her cat) of the original.
It's seventy years after the events of
Alien. Ripley is horrified to learn that the
planet that held the alien derelict and
eggs is being colonized. No one will be
lieve Ripley's story . . . until contact with
the planet is mysteriously lost. Sent back
with a contingent of tough space marines
led by Michael (The Terminator) Biehn,
Ripley finds hordes of the toothy terrors
and faces down their termite like Queen
in a finale that could make Rocky /Klook
like a pattycake contest.

AMERICAN ANTHEM
Combine a dazzling palette of col
ors, pulsating rock rhythyms and
music video stylistics, and there
suit is American Anthem, director
Albert Magnoli's follow up to the smash
success, Purf)le Rain. The arena this time
is the sport of gymnastics, where conflicts
between relationships, goals and the
competition provide the drama.
Olympic gold medalist Mitch Gaylord
makes his motion picture debut opposite
Janet Jones, the lithe young actress who
burst on the movie scene with The Fla
mingo Kid and A Chorus l.ine.
Steve Tevere (Gaylord) faces a coming
of age conflict (What an original concept
for a youth film!). As he is launching his
career in gymnastics, his father is laid off
and he loses the strength and moral sup
port he has known throughout his teen
years. Enter Julie (Jones) an attractive,
talented gymnast who has left her family
and ventured West to challenge herself

competitively and emotionally. Together
they work toward their mutual goal-the
U.S. Gymnastics Championships and a
shot at the Olympics.
These events provide the setting for the
film's climactic finale, a spectacular dis
play of vaults, twists, Hips and all-around
agility which features more than 100 top
level gymnasts from around the globe. In
eluded in this group are world champions
Steve Elliott and China's Li Yuejiu, and an
additional seven members from the U.S.
National team and two members of the
Canadian National team.
American Anthem, filmed entirely on
location in Phoenix and the aspen groves
of northern Arizona, features vibrant vi
suals edited to the tempo of an incredible
soundtrack, and offers sport fans a chance
to watch some fine gymnastics. ♦

AMERICAN ANTHEM
Combine a dazzling palette of col
ors, pulsating rock rhythyms and
music video stylistics, and there
suit is American Anthem, director
Albert Magnoli's follow up to the smash
success, Purf)le Rain. The arena this time
is the sport of gymnastics, where conflicts
between relationships, goals and the
competition provide the drama.
Olympic gold medalist Mitch Gaylord
makes his motion picture debut opposite
Janet Jones, the lithe young actress who
burst on the movie scene with The Fla
mingo Kid and A Chorus l.ine.
Steve Tevere (Gaylord) faces a coming
of age conflict (What an original concept
for a youth film!). As he is launching his
career in gymnastics, his father is laid off
and he loses the strength and moral sup
port he has known throughout his teen
years. Enter Julie (Jones) an attractive,
talented gymnast who has left her family
and ventured West to challenge herself

competitively and emotionally. Together
they work toward their mutual goal-the
U.S. Gymnastics Championships and a
shot at the Olympics.
These events provide the setting for the
film's climactic finale, a spectacular dis
play of vaults, twists, Hips and all-around
agility which features more than 100 top
level gymnasts from around the globe. In
eluded in this group are world champions
Steve Elliott and China's Li Yuejiu, and an
additional seven members from the U.S.
National team and two members of the
Canadian National team.
American Anthem, filmed entirely on
location in Phoenix and the aspen groves
of northern Arizona, features vibrant vi
suals edited to the tempo of an incredible
soundtrack, and offers sport fans a chance
to watch some fine gymnastics. ♦

THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS
Just when you thought it was safe to
go back to the greenhouse ... along
comes The Little Shop Of Horrors,
with Audrey 11, its people eating
plant. Director Frank Oz (of Muppets
fame) says cheerfully, "By the time we're
finished, the entire cast is eaten. I know a
lot of directors will envy that."
You probably would love Audrey 11, if
you could see her, but, until the movie is
released, she's being kept under wraps.
"All I can say is she sings, she dances, she
dials the phone, and she eats people,"
says Lyle Conway, her designer. Those
who have seen her say she starts out small
and sexy, and, fed human beings, grows
to truly huge proportions.
Audrey II first proved her popularity in
the original Little Shop, a low budget
Roger Corman film made 25 years ago.
("We spent $40,000 on ours," says Cor
man ruefully. "This one is $20 million.")
Four years ago, Little Shop of Horrors was
resurrected as an offoff Broadway musi
cal comedy Its success encouraged
Warner Bros, to reprise it on film.
"It's not a big, splashy Hollywood mu
sical," says Henson. "The music is an in
tegral part of the story and moves the plot
forward. We haven't opened up the plot
so much as we've enriched it."
The action takes place in Mushnick's
Flower Shop in a rundown part of town.
Seymour (Rick Moranis), a nerdy floral
assistant, buys a strange little plant and
names it for his girlfriend Audrey.
Having no awe of the Hollywood star
system, the plant snacks happily on cast
members Steve Guttenberg, Bill Murray,
Raul Dooley, Vincent Gardenia, et al—
though not necessarily in that order.

CLUR PARADISE
M M A ■ one of us could wait to get
■ ® down on location," says
Twiggy, who stars with
I Robin Williams and Peter
O'Toole in Harold Ramis' (Ghosthusters)
new film Club Paradise.
"I had just come from a film set in Fng
land, where it was freezing cold," said the
actress and former model who set the
style for London's swinging sixties."We
all were so glad to be in the sun, we
would have played the phone book. As it
turned out, it was a very, very funny script,
so we were lucky in all ways."
Club I'aradise is a comic mixture of ro
mance, revolution and seedy resorts,
written by Ramis. "It also includes a
smarmy Fnglishman, which I play," says
Simon Jones (Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy, Rrideshead Revisited). "It's a

small but nasty part, and I liked playing it,
especially in Jamaica.
"Robin Williams plays the good guy.
I le's a fireman from Chicago who wisely
decides he's had enough of cold and
snow and fighting fires. He comes to Par
adise, where he not so wisely decides to
invest in a rundown resort hotel with Jim
my Cliff, who is having trouble with the
local corrupt politicos. Along the way,
Robin manages to attract the cook and
first mate of my yacht to his enterprise.
Since the mate is Twiggy, you can under
stand my deep resentment."
There's Peter O'Toole's sun-drenched
Governor General, who hates to have his
cushy life disturbed. And there's his girl
112 riend, a travel writer who wants to report
on world events and sees her destiny in
an island revolution.
"In fact, things were so complicated,"
says Simon Jones, "that Harold was the
only one who knew what was going
on." — Joan Goodman
