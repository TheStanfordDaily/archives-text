Blake Edwards added stars Ted Danson
and Howie Mandel, some manic gang
sters, lots of slapstick and several dozen

Endearment, director Ivan Reitman's

loons who created Airplane!-. Zucker,
Zucker and Abrams.
JULY o HEARTBURN—The intriguing
star pairing of Meryl Streep and Jack Nich
olson would probably make a movie in

teresting if it consisted of readings from

there's an actual story, and it's an adapta
tion of Nora Ephron's (unofficial) auto
biographical comic novel about the
breakup of her marriage to journalist Carl
Bernstein.

ing turns a military robot into an AWOI.
peace activist. Steve Guttenberg is the sci
entist on the robot's trail and Ally Sheedy
is the mechanical rebel's new friend.
JULY 2 o THE LITTLE SHOP OF HOR
RORS—First it was a low budget movie.
Then it was an off Broadway musical.
Now it's a big budget movie musical. It's

the cast. Rick Moranis stars, and Steve
Martin and Bill Murray have cameos.
