tour schedules are subject to change.

CALLING—A hot black comic is forced to
re evaluate his life when he is nearly
killed by his involvement with drugs.

Music Box. For his new version, director
Blake Edwards added stars Ted Danson
and Howie Mandel, some manic gang
sters, lots of slapstick and several dozen

length movie. If it's half as funny as Stan

anything but a mess.

very scary world existing beneath China
town in his John Carpenter adventure

comedy that's promising to include ev

comedy about a singles resort stars Robin
Williams, Peter O'Toole, Rick Moranis,
Eugene Levy, Twiggy and Andrea Martin,

be funny
JUNE 20 o LEGAL EAGLES—Robert
Redford's first movie since Out of Africa,
Debra Winger's first movie since Terms of
Endearment, director Ivan Reitman's
first movie since Ghostbusters and Daryl

clear off your toy shelves, storeowners).

who's left standing?
JUNE 27 o RUTHLESS PEOPLE—Bette
Midler stars as a kidnap victim no one
wants —not her millionaire husband,
not her hapless kidnappers, no one.
Seems she's a bit hard to get along with
(not Bette!). Danny DeVito and Judge
Reinhold co-star. The directors are the
loons who created Airplane!-. Zucker,
Zucker and Abrams.
JULY o HEARTBURN—The intriguing
star pairing of Meryl Streep and Jack Nich
olson would probably make a movie in

teresting if it consisted of readings from
the phone book. In this case, however,
there's an actual story, and it's an adapta
tion of Nora Ephron's (unofficial) auto
biographical comic novel about the
breakup of her marriage to journalist Carl
Bernstein.
JULY o SHORT ClßCUlT—Haywire wir
ing turns a military robot into an AWOI.
peace activist. Steve Guttenberg is the sci
entist on the robot's trail and Ally Sheedy
is the mechanical rebel's new friend.
JULY 2 o THE LITTLE SHOP OF HOR
RORS—First it was a low budget movie.
Then it was an off Broadway musical.
Now it's a big budget movie musical. It's

and eats until it has swallowed most of
the cast. Rick Moranis stars, and Steve
Martin and Bill Murray have cameos.
