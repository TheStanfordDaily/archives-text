### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
In the wake of last week's ASSU refer
endum declaring Stanford a sanctuary,
members of several student organizations
held a press conference at Old Union yes
terday to explain their plans tor assisting
Central American refugees during the rest
of this year.
In a related development. Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Student Affairs, told
The Daily yesterday that Herman, a Sal
vadoran refugee who has been living in
Stanford housing since April 10. can move
from one campus residence to another
after three-day periods without violating

University housing policy.
Robinson said, however, that the ASSU
declaration of Stanford as a sanctuary does
not change the Office of Residential Edu
cation's decision not to allow Herman to
stay at Columbae House for more than
three days.
Housing policy states that the three-day

Representatives from Campus Christian
Ministry, MEChA and University Lut

prisoned by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, conducting a dorm
outreach program intended to increase
awareness of the plight of refugees, estab
lishing a tutoring program for Central
American refugees and continuing to
house and feed refugees where possible.
In an interview yesterday, Diana Con
klin. assistant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Row, said members of
Columbae House formally requested such
permission from Conklin before beginning
to offer accommodations to Herman.
Conklin said she refused the request
based on Columbae's intention not simply
to have a nuest. but to house someone.

"There is a difference," she said.
Both Robinson and Conklin supported
the sanctuary movement in general. "I've
been in support of what the students are
doing from the beginning," Conklin said,
adding, "But they don't have to break
housing policy to further the cause of sanc
tuary. The housing policy and the sanctu
ary movement are not incompatible."
Columbae resident Caroline Paul
stressed that Herman was moving from
residence to residence not to comply with
University policy, but to be able to talk
with more people.
"We are not ashamed of what we are
