## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY Staff writer 
In the wake of last week's ASSU refer
endum declaring Stanford a sanctuary,
members of several student organizations
held a press conference at Old Union yes
terday to explain their plans tor assisting
Central American refugees during the rest
of this year.
In a related development. Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Student Affairs, told
The Daily yesterday that Herman, a Sal
vadoran refugee who has been living in
Stanford housing since April 10. can move
from one campus residence to another
after three-day periods without violating

University housing policy.
Robinson said, however, that the ASSU
declaration of Stanford as a sanctuary does
not change the Office of Residential Edu
cation's decision not to allow Herman to
stay at Columbae House for more than
three days.
Housing policy states that the three-day
limit for guests can be lengthened only
through special permission from the Res
Ed Office. Robinson said.
Representatives from Campus Christian
Ministry, MEChA and University Lut
herans attended the Sanctuary at Stanford
organized press conference to discuss the
concrete steps Stanford students plan to
take in support of the movement, includ

ing: raising bail money tor refugees im
prisoned by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, conducting a dorm
outreach program intended to increase
awareness of the plight of refugees, estab
lishing a tutoring program for Central
American refugees and continuing to
house and feed refugees where possible.
In an interview yesterday, Diana Con
klin. assistant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Row, said members of
Columbae House formally requested such
permission from Conklin before beginning
to offer accommodations to Herman.
Conklin said she refused the request
based on Columbae's intention not simply
to have a nuest. but to house someone.

"There is a difference," she said.
Both Robinson and Conklin supported
the sanctuary movement in general. "I've
been in support of what the students are
doing from the beginning," Conklin said,
adding, "But they don't have to break
housing policy to further the cause of sanc
tuary. The housing policy and the sanctu
ary movement are not incompatible."
Columbae resident Caroline Paul
stressed that Herman was moving from
residence to residence not to comply with
University policy, but to be able to talk
with more people.
"We are not ashamed of what we are
doing at all," Paul said. "To move
Herman around in order to conform
to some policy would be treating Her
man like an animal. It's totally his
choice to move around."
Columbae resident Tony Tran and
eating associate Lee Altenberg said
Herman has been "very busy" talking
to various dorms and groups and that
house residents are not adopting a
"big brother" attitude toward him.
"He is simply welcome here," Tran
said.
Tran and Altenberg were not sure
whether Herman would spend last
night at Casa Zapata or Columbae.
They said he planned to move into
the Delta Kappa Epsilon House in
the near future.
Asked if he planned to investigate
whether Herman had spent more
than three days at Columbae, Robin
son said, "When we have reason to
believe something is amiss, we'll do
something. Unless there is, we
won't."
In a related development, the resi
dents of Casa Zapata also declared
their house a sanctuary. Casa Zapata
residents sent an April 19 letter to
Columbae House stating, "We, the
residents of Casa Zapata, declare
ourselves in solidarity with you in
your declaration as a sanctuary for
Central American refugees."
Columbae residents are also
nearing a decision about housing an
other refugee in their house, accord
ing to Paul. "As a sanctuary, we are
always ready to welcome more
refugees," she said, adding that the
house as a whole will not have come
to a final decision on this possibility
until after a house meeting to be held
in a few days.
Members of Okada House and the
American Studies House are also
considering declaring their residences
sanctuaries and taking in Herman for

a few nights.
The ASSU referendum declaring
Stanford a sanctuary places it in the
company of more than 20 universities
nationwide, including nine University
of California campuses.
Sanctuary groups typically claim
that U.S. immigration policy is
skewed for political reasons. For in
stance, Columbae House's initial

declaration of sanctuary stated that
"the Immigration and Naturalization
Service has denied these refugees the
legal protection guaranteed them.
While over 75 percent of all refugees
from the Soviet Union and Iran are
granted asylum if they apply for it,
only 2 percent of Salvadorans and
less than 1 percent of Guatemalans
are granted this status."

The main entrance sign placed by Sanctuary at Stanford members
publicizes the movement, which members say was strengthened by last
week's ASSU referendum.
In the wake of last week's ASSU refer
endum declaring Stanford a sanctuary,
members of several student organizations
held a press conference at Old Union yes
terday to explain their plans tor assisting
Central American refugees during the rest
of this year.
In a related development. Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Student Affairs, told
The Daily yesterday that Herman, a Sal
vadoran refugee who has been living in
Stanford housing since April 10. can move
from one campus residence to another
after three-day periods without violating

University housing policy.
Robinson said, however, that the ASSU
declaration of Stanford as a sanctuary does
not change the Office of Residential Edu
cation's decision not to allow Herman to
stay at Columbae House for more than
three days.
Housing policy states that the three-day
limit for guests can be lengthened only
through special permission from the Res
Ed Office. Robinson said.
Representatives from Campus Christian
Ministry, MEChA and University Lut
herans attended the Sanctuary at Stanford
organized press conference to discuss the
concrete steps Stanford students plan to
take in support of the movement, includ

ing: raising bail money tor refugees im
prisoned by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, conducting a dorm
outreach program intended to increase
awareness of the plight of refugees, estab
lishing a tutoring program for Central
American refugees and continuing to
house and feed refugees where possible.
In an interview yesterday, Diana Con
klin. assistant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Row, said members of
Columbae House formally requested such
permission from Conklin before beginning
to offer accommodations to Herman.
Conklin said she refused the request
based on Columbae's intention not simply
to have a nuest. but to house someone.

"There is a difference," she said.
Both Robinson and Conklin supported
the sanctuary movement in general. "I've
been in support of what the students are
doing from the beginning," Conklin said,
adding, "But they don't have to break
housing policy to further the cause of sanc
tuary. The housing policy and the sanctu
ary movement are not incompatible."
Columbae resident Caroline Paul
stressed that Herman was moving from
residence to residence not to comply with
University policy, but to be able to talk
with more people.
"We are not ashamed of what we are
doing at all," Paul said. "To move
Herman around in order to conform
to some policy would be treating Her
man like an animal. It's totally his
choice to move around."
Columbae resident Tony Tran and
eating associate Lee Altenberg said
Herman has been "very busy" talking
to various dorms and groups and that
house residents are not adopting a
"big brother" attitude toward him.
"He is simply welcome here," Tran
said.
Tran and Altenberg were not sure
whether Herman would spend last
night at Casa Zapata or Columbae.
They said he planned to move into
the Delta Kappa Epsilon House in
the near future.
Asked if he planned to investigate
whether Herman had spent more
than three days at Columbae, Robin
son said, "When we have reason to
believe something is amiss, we'll do
something. Unless there is, we
won't."
In a related development, the resi
dents of Casa Zapata also declared
their house a sanctuary. Casa Zapata
residents sent an April 19 letter to
Columbae House stating, "We, the
residents of Casa Zapata, declare
ourselves in solidarity with you in
your declaration as a sanctuary for
Central American refugees."
Columbae residents are also
nearing a decision about housing an
other refugee in their house, accord
ing to Paul. "As a sanctuary, we are
always ready to welcome more
refugees," she said, adding that the
house as a whole will not have come
to a final decision on this possibility
until after a house meeting to be held
