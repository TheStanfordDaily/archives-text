# Group works toward world beyond war

### KRISTEN BROWN Staff writer 
The crowd seemed especially solemn the night of
April 14 in Kresge Auditorium, where it was gath
ered to hear four Stanford faculty members discuss
one of the most pressing issues of our time: the
threat of nuclear war.

The panel discussion was sponsored by Beyond
War, a group that was organized last year at Stan
ford and is part of the national Beyond War move
ment, which was founded in 1982 in Palo Alto. The
organization now has chapters in 25 states ranging
from California to Connecticut and foreign
countries such as Germany and Canada.
According to the 1985 Beyond War handbook,
the Beyond War movement is a "direct response to
the crisis facing our world, a crisis brought about by
the major nations contronting each other — and life
itself — with unimaginable levels of destruction.
Today, we face the clear possiblity of extinction.
"The basic tenets of the movement are that war,
all war. is obsolete and. therefore, we must now
seek other means to resolve conflict between nations and
people ... the root cause of war is not economics, nor so
cial systems, but the way we as humans think about con
flict."
The pamphlet describes the organization's purpose as
informing people of "the crisis we face" and providing
them with "the opportunity to discuss, develop and
demonsrate a new way of thinking that will bring about a
world beyond war."
The discussion was entitled "New Thinking: Critical
Paths to Survival," and sophomore John Farr, representa
tive for Beyond War at Stanford, introduced the panel
members.
Farr called the series "part of a two year process in
which a growing number of Stanford students, faculty and
staff are exploring the implications of warfare in the world
today and looking to alternative means to resolving con
flict."
He said that the solution to the nuclear crisis will not be
easily attainable.
"The solution must come in some sort of process," he
said. "A process that must start long before the solution is
ever to come. This lecture series is a part of that process."
The first three speakers were Wolfgang Panofsky,
director emeritus of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter; Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences Lincoln
Moses; and Gary Williams, assistant dean of the Graduate
School of Business.
Dr. Herbert Abrams, co-founder of International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, was the
final panelist. In his talk, Abrams focused directly on the
U.S.-Libya conflict and its implications for world stability.
Abrams' was an imagined lecture "given on September
18, 1998 to undergraduates studying history at the Uni
versity of Argentina" by a fictitious Prof. Cordova.
"This course will deal selectively with the last decade
from our modern perspective of 1998," Abrams began.
"From the time he came to power in September 1969,
(Libyan leader Col. Moammar) Khadafy made no secret
about his desire to secure weapons," Abrams said.
"Technical assistance and the promise of a small research
reactor were two of the subjects discussed during the visit
of (Soviet) Premier Kosygin to Libya in 1975."
Abrams explained that the two countries then em
barked upon a partnership to build and run several nu
clear reactors.
"The partnership was further strengthened by the two
countries' training arrangements," Abrams said. "An esti
mated 700 to 800 students were sent to the Soviet Union
to study nuclear engineering in 1980. This figure was
many times what could be realistically absorbed by civil
ian needs."
Abrams continued his imagined lecture: "In December
1980, Libya went so far as to launch a full-scale but un
successful invasion of Chad with the stated aim of throw

ing open the borders and unifying the two countries.
"In February 1985, Khadafy moved again to seize con
trol of Chad. Rather than launch an invasion, he tried to
blow up the Chad President's entire cabinet," Abrams
said.
Abrams then cited some recent terrorist attacks that
injured or killed Americans, such as the explosion of a
bomb in a Berlin nightclub and the hijacking of a TWA
passenger plane.
The terrorist attacks, Abrams explained, contributed to
a tense atmosphere that exploded when U.S. planes

bombed several military sites near Tripoli.
This act prompted Libyan retaliation that led to a full
scale nuclear war, according to Abrams' ficticious history.
"When the Libyan missile exploded on Washington at 6
a.m. on April 23, 1986, the U.S. was stunned," Abrams
said. "Despite Reagan's escape, the U.S. capital was an
nihilated. The vast majority of the president's civilian ad
visers were killed. The president immediately gave the
word to the strategic air command to prepare for a
counter attack."
Abrams said that President Reagan believed that the

missile was launched "with the support of the Kremlin"
and ordered an immediate retaliation against both Libya
and the Soviet Union.
"Across the Atlantic, Soviet leaders had been trying to
contact American officials to vindicate their claim of non-*
involvement, but the [communication system] had been
rendered inoperative by the bombing," Abrams contin
ued.
"When the Soviet general staff realized that an Ameri
can strike was imminent, the Soviets made a decision to
launch on warning. The American and Soviet home lands
were annihilated within minutes of each other. ... The
sky darkened and the temperature began to drop.
"By the week's end the survivors focused on a burning
question: Who was more fortunate, the dead or the
living?"
"How lucky we were in Argentina, never to have nu
clear weapons," continued Abrams, as though he were
Cordova.
"As we return to Palo Alto in 1986 and to' New Think
ing: Critical Paths to Survival,' we know that there are
numerous other pathways to annihilation," Abrams said.
"How can we avoid the third and final world war?"
asked Abrams. "Speaking as a physician facing the
greatest problem of life and health of our era, I can say
that we have tried to make clear that there is no cure once
a nuclear war erupts. Just as there is none for AIDS at this
time. There is only prevention."
When Abrams finished his presentation, the panelists
fielded questions from the audience.
One person asked what course of action an undergradu
ate should take if he or she wanted to "throw his or her
whole weight" into the prevention of nuclear war.
Panofsky said that students can begin by registering in
Political Science 138 A. "You will at least learn the his
torical perspective of how we got here from there," he
said.
"One of the most gratifying things which I find in
traveling around Washington is to suddenly find graduates
from this experience ... in hidden pockets of competence
in the State Department," Panofsky said.
"I think knowledge is essential."
Moses encouraged students to examine all arguments
closely. "Most ideas that get into political action have
been put there largely by lies. We (Americans) tolerate
more nonsense than we should," he said.
There will be three more lectures this year sponsored by
Beyond War at Stanford. William Durham, an associate
professor of anthropology, will speak ip Roble Hall on
April 29 on "Survival and Cultural Change." Electrical
Engineering Prof. Martin Hellman will talk about
"Building a World Beyond War" on May 6 at Florence
Moore Hall. Steven Brandt, senior lecturer in the
Graduate School of Business, will discuss
"Entrepreneuring New Thinking" at Wilbur Hall on May
13.
All lectures will be held at 7 p.m.
