# New state law may lead to organ donor increase
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
Stanford Medical Center is experiencing an increase
in organ and tissue donations, apparently due in part to
a new state law requiring hospitals to ask a family's
permission for donations when a relative dies.
Against the backdrop of National Organ Donation
Week, which ends this weekend, Marguerite Brown,
the medical center's donor coordinator, has announced
a 43 percent increase in heart transplants performed at
the medical center since Jan, 1 compared to a similar
period last year.
Since the new law went into effect at the beginning
of this year, 20 heart transplants and two combined
heart-lung transplants have been performed at the
medical center, Brown said. During the same time per
iod last year, only 14 heart transplants and two heart
lung transplants were performed at Stanford, the
world's largest heart transplant center.
According to Brown, even larger increases are oc
curring in the area of tissue donation. Tissues that can
be donated include the cornea, certain middle ear
structures, bone, cartilage and skin. Part of the reason
that tissue donations have increased more than organ
donations is that restrictions concerning the age and
manner of death for tissue donors are not as strict as
those for organ donors, she said.
Organs are only suitable for transplantation if the
donor has died from brain death, Brown said. When
the brain dies, the body can be maintained for a short
time period by the use of drugs and respirators, but
other causes of death result in damage to the organs.
Brain death tends only to result from brain injuries,
such as those sustained in motorcycle or auto acci
dents. The pool of organ donors is severely limited as a
result, so that even the increase in donations does not
match the number desired.
At any one time, Stanford has eight to 10 people
waiting for heart transplants and 15 to 20 waiting for
heart-lung transplants. Twenty-five percent of these do
not receive organs in time to prevent their deaths. The
number of people accepted into the program is limited

by the number of organs donated.
"Hundreds of suitable recipients [exist] that we just
can't accept," Brown said.
Brown estimates that Stanford could perform two
heart transplants a week if there were no limit on
available organs. This would bring the yearly number
to 104. Last year, 48 heart transplants were done here.
"Don't think we would ever be limited by physical
space or other factors," she said.
The Regional Procurement Agency of Southern Cal
ifornia estimates that nationwide, 10,000 people are
waiting for kidney transplants, 175 for livers, 150 for
hearts and 30 for pancreases.
Brown said she believes that donations might be
lower than possible partially because the public may
have misconceptions about transplants. For instance,
some people may be unaware of the small size of the
available organ pool.
Another misunderstanding might be that signing an
organ donor card automatically means that the signer's
organs will be removed following death, even if he has
changed his mind. According to Brown, hospitals al
ways ask the family to agree to donate the deceased's
organs even if a donor card has already been signed.
For this reason, all families should discuss individual
wishes on the subject before a decision has to be made.
After the family has given consent, the organs to be
donated are removed under sterile conditions. The
body is not disfigured — wounds are stitched and
bandaged — and funeral arrangements do not have to
be delayed. Brown said usually organs are not removed
until just before the transplant, because preservation
techniques allow a heart to be preserved out of the
body for only four hours, a liver for 12 hours and a kid
ney for two days.
Organ and tissue donations are not just used for
transplant. If a donor is older than the transplant age
limit, or if the donation is otherwise inappropriate for
transplantation, the organ or tissue will often be used
for research.
Other questions about donation and transplantation
can be answered at a booth outside the Stanford
Wr»«nitai main cafeteria this week and next.
