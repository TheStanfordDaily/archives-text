# Shantytown moves to Quad

### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Stanford Out of South Africa members yesterday
placed a wooden shantytown replica at the office
door of University President Donald Kennedy, de
manding that a resolution to divest the University's
South Africa-related holdings be placed on the
agenda for a Board of„Xfustees meeting next
month.
The 20 student protesters, who carried the
structure symbolizing the living conditions of South
African blacks from its former site in White Plaza,
also constructed a second dwelling in front of Ken
nedy's Building 10 office while reporters and fac
ulty looked on.
A note presented to Kennedy from "concerned
students and members of the Stanford community"
demanded that, in accordance with the two-third
majority vote on a divestment referendum last
week, the University divest its funds from corpora
tions doing business in South Africa.

The group also demanded that:
• the board issue a definitive statement on its
policies on the issue of total divestment after the
May meeting;
• the May Board of Trustees meeting be open to
the public given the very public nature of the issue
being addressed.

lenson said yesterday during the protest. "The
public should be made a part of it." One idea. Bel
ienson said, would be to broadcast the meeting live
on Stanford radio station KZSU.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, who wit
nessed the protest, said yesterday that although he
predicted the trustees would discuss the matter at
their May 12 meeting, he felt it would not make
any difference to the University's present policy
concerning divestment.
"The University already has a selective divest
ment policy. For a lot of people the issue is whether
that policy is being carried out," Lyons said.

SOSA member Robby Perkins said yesterday
that he felt the protest would send a clear message
to Kennedy and the trustees.
"It'll show that people care enough to do some
thing. I think people realize now how unreasonable
the ti ustees are being," he said. Perkins, a senior, is
currently bringing a lawsuit against Stanford and
Santa Clara County police for alleged brutality re
mJtintt frtimffii anti-apartheid protest last October.
Despite the apparent support for divestment re
sulting from ASSU voting returns, some students
believe that anti-apartheid activism is losing vitality
on campus. One junior contrasted yesterday's
protest with the activites a year ago, such as the
huge "sleep-in" protests outside Kennedy's office.
SOSA member Mike Schmitz said, however, that
although this spring has seen "lower levels" of stu
dent activism, factors such as the media blackout of
current events in South Africa are partly to blame.
"There's also a sense now that it will be harder to

get results from the University,"
Schmitz said.
The trial of 23 protesters arrested
in three October incidents of civil dis
obedience ended yesterday when
graduate student Eric Diesel was sen
tenced to two days of time served for
his participation in the protests.
SOSA is planning to stage another
rally tomorrow, when Kennedy is ex
pected to give a response to the
demands issued yesterday, Schmitz
said.
