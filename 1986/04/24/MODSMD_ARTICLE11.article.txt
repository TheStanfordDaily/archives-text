## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Clean up parking mess 
### 
You know the story.
It's late. You're driving home. You get to your
dorm, and there's nowhere to park. So you go to an
other dorm and park in their lot, or better yet, you
park in the spot reserved for the resident fellow. The
next morning, you wake up. You go to your car, and lo
and behold, there's a parking ticket on your
windshield.
Or — another version — you're late to class, and you
can't find a place to park. The only thing you can do is
park in a 4W-minute spot. Class ends 50 minutes later.
You go to your car, and there's another ticket on your
windshield.
Okay — so how many unpaid tickets do you have in
your glove compartment? Five? Ten? More?
According to Santa Clara County officials, Stanford
students have run up a tab of $2.7 million in unpaid
parking tickets since 1980. That is, 86,000 tickets have
been issued and ignored, and Santa Clara County
wants your money. Now. Stanford wouldn't mind
having a share of the revenue either.
Indeed, the only reason the parking ticket problem
has surfaced is that Stanford officials contacted Santa
Clara County several months ago regarding the possi
bility of revenue sharing, and county staffers discov
ered the number of outstanding tickets.
The way it now stands is that Stanford police issue
the tickets — between 40,000 and 50,000 a year—but
the county Department of Revenue collects the fines,
and because the University is on unincorporated prop
erty, the money goes to the Santa Clara County De
partment of Revenue. Students have no incentive to
pay their tickets because all the county can do is place a
"hold" on the vehicle's registration with the Depart
ment of Motor Vehicles, and Stanford has no incentive
to enforce payment because they don't receive the
money.

In order to collect the fines, however, Santa Clara
County officials are proposing several changes. One
would be to share the revenue from the parking fines
with Stanford, increasing Stanford's willingness to en
force payment.
The other proposals are aimed at students, making it
more costly and difficult for them to avoid payment.
These include requiring students to pay up before
being allowed to register for classes and making it
easier for Stanford police to tow vehicles with five or
more outstanding tickets.
All these changes might encourage students to pay
their parking fines, but none of them seem to be
dealing with the real problem. Why are so many
parking tickets issued? Do Stanford and Santa Clara
County officials believe that Stanford students park il
legally just for the fun of it? It would be more con
structive to discover why students have run up such a
bill, before they worry about collecting the fines.
Part of the reason so many tickets are issued is that
there are just not enough parking spaces on this
campus, or at least they are not available in the places
where most people need to park and where they are
allowed to park.
One solution would be to issue a University parking
sticker to all students. This would enable students to
park in any of the lots designated for student parking.
This way, if the parking lot at one residence was full,
then you could park in another residence area without
worrying about receiving a ticket. Additionally, Stan
ford could change the 40-minute parking zones to at
least 50-minute parking since most classes run 50
minutes.
To solve the parking problem, Stanford should make
it easier for students to park their cars, not focus on in
centives to make students pay their tickets.
