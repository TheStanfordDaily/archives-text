## Frats victimized unfairly 
### 
My congratulations to The Daily editorial board for
once again completely slandering and misrepresenting
fraternities on campus. This has been going on for quite
some time now, but Tuesday's editorial "Take housing
from frats" reached a pinnacle in poor journalism.
• Not only was the editorial uncalled for, given the
"witch-hunt" bias of (he piece, but the information pre
sented within ran from hearsay to complete speculation.
The Delta Upsilons' recent escapades are inexecusable,
but that does not warrant The Daily printing that the DUs
"the same night" as the incident with the two freshmen,
"lit a couch on fire . . ." when in fact the incident with the

DAVID NORTHW AY

couch occurred two nights later. The University has
hardly just "s(a)t back and considered)" the recent ac
tions of the DUs. Obviously, if anyone on the editorial
board had cared to investigate, the DUs' behavior is being
looked into by both the University and the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), with action having already been taken
against them by the University.
• Claiming that there "lurks a tradition of sexism and
elitism in all the fraternities." After mentioning only one
sentence earlier that "of course, all fraternities are not the
same," how can the editorial board go on to make such a
simplisitic, generalized, naive statement? Does this mean
that my friends in Columbae, by virtue of living in a house
stereotyped as "earth mamas" all do drugs and have vi
sions of overthrowing the capitalist machine? Does this
sound ridiculous? Well then, you in the Stanford commu
nity now know how a fraternity member feels when The
Daily makes such stereotypical statements against our sys
tem.
The argument that fraternities unfairly have beautiful
houses while others wallow in University dorm accommo
dations goes something like this, according to The Daily:
Fraternities have nice houses, we don't. If fraternities
want their own houses, why don't they just move off
campus and buy one and let the rest of us live in their
great housing? Do people know why our houses are so
wonderful and in great shape, why we "monopolize a
central and desirable part of student housing?" Because a
long time ago when groups of men on campus realized life
could be more fun living together with a group of close
friends they did buy "houses off campus" in what was
then the old Row. Fraternities organized themselves on
this campus and paid for houses on this campus with their
own money.
Unfortunately, in the 19505, as the campus was expand
ing. the University came forward with the proposition that
fraternities could sell their older houses to the University
and in exchange move into "new" houses constructed for
them near Lake Lagunita. Some fraternities turned this
down wisely, with the Sigma Chis lucky enough to still
own their house entirely. Others were not so wise and
agreed to the University's proposal, and are now in a state
of limbo as to the degree to which they own their house.

Realize that when The Daily claims fraternities are
"University housing" it does so ignorant of the history be
hind fraternity housing on this campus.
All right, you say, fraternities own part or all of the
house they live in, even paid for a good part of these
houses . . . what does this have to do with their being
"desirable houses?" Everything, because when you own a
house and know that the people who live with you are part
of that house, living there for three years as pan of a close
group, you will take time and effort to keep your house
beautiful. Living in a house that you in part own instills
pride. People work to keep their houses nice because we
know that next year and the years after, others who
become a part of our groups will share in this pride.
Obviously, some fraternities take more pride in their
houses than others: those who don t must be questioned
as to their right to maintain such a privilege. The Univer
sity ultimately owns the land on which fraternities rest,
but not the entire houses themselves.
• Now, in regards to "elitism." The Daily's editorial
claims that fraternities have "no place in a recognized in
stitution at Stanford." Interesting. Does this mean that
fraternities, being all male, closely-knit groups of friends
enjoying each other's interests and goals do not belong on
campus? This statement sounds elitist in itself, calling for
the removal of an alternative housing option that many
males have obviously found attractive at Stanford over its
long history. If you seriously believe that all fraternities
should be thrown off campus, then, by this argument, so
too must any theme house or prioritized living group
which selectively defines its membership in any v/ay.
I have already mentioned that fraternities who do per
petrate acts of vandalism to their houses or to others
around them have no place on this campus, but a frater
nity does not warrant removal from this campus from a
house that it in whole or in part paid for simply because
someone at The Daily naively decides all fraternities are
"sexist and elitist."
Many non-fraternal, diverse, selective groups exist on
this campus. (No, that is not a contradiction in terms).
They choose their members for reasons stemming from
athletic, social or academic interest. (As a note, people
might want to think about the difference between the way
this University admits students and the way these groups
select theirs . . . little, you'll find). The main difference be
tween these other select groups and fraternities is that
long ago on this campus fraternities decided that they
cared strongly enough about their groups to pay for their
own housing. Other groups are free to do the same, but no
one has the right to claim that the University "gave" fra
ternities their houses.
I hope that this letter has clarified this one issue more
clearly: it is unfortunate that someone from the fraternal
system must clarify misinformation and stereotypes per
petrated by The Daily editorial board. In the future I hope
that a more responsible style of journalism is pursued by
The Daily.

this campus and paid for houses on this campus with their
own money.
Unfortunately, in the 19505, as the campus was expand
ing. the University came forward with the proposition that
fraternities could sell their older houses to the University
and in exchange move into "new" houses constructed for
them near Lake Lagunita. Some fraternities turned this
down wisely, with the Sigma Chis lucky enough to still
own their house entirely. Others were not so wise and
agreed to the University's proposal, and are now in a state
of limbo as to the degree to which they own their house.

Realize that when The Daily claims fraternities are
"University housing" it does so ignorant of the history be
hind fraternity housing on this campus.
All right, you say, fraternities own part or all of the
house they live in, even paid for a good part of these
houses . . . what does this have to do with their being
"desirable houses?" Everything, because when you own a
house and know that the people who live with you are part
of that house, living there for three years as pan of a close
group, you will take time and effort to keep your house
beautiful. Living in a house that you in part own instills
pride. People work to keep their houses nice because we
know that next year and the years after, others who
become a part of our groups will share in this pride.
Obviously, some fraternities take more pride in their
houses than others: those who don t must be questioned
as to their right to maintain such a privilege. The Univer
sity ultimately owns the land on which fraternities rest,
but not the entire houses themselves.
• Now, in regards to "elitism." The Daily's editorial
claims that fraternities have "no place in a recognized in
stitution at Stanford." Interesting. Does this mean that
fraternities, being all male, closely-knit groups of friends
enjoying each other's interests and goals do not belong on
campus? This statement sounds elitist in itself, calling for
the removal of an alternative housing option that many
males have obviously found attractive at Stanford over its
long history. If you seriously believe that all fraternities
should be thrown off campus, then, by this argument, so
too must any theme house or prioritized living group
which selectively defines its membership in any v/ay.
I have already mentioned that fraternities who do per
petrate acts of vandalism to their houses or to others
around them have no place on this campus, but a frater
nity does not warrant removal from this campus from a
house that it in whole or in part paid for simply because
someone at The Daily naively decides all fraternities are
"sexist and elitist."
Many non-fraternal, diverse, selective groups exist on
this campus. (No, that is not a contradiction in terms).
They choose their members for reasons stemming from
athletic, social or academic interest. (As a note, people
might want to think about the difference between the way
this University admits students and the way these groups
select theirs . . . little, you'll find). The main difference be
tween these other select groups and fraternities is that
long ago on this campus fraternities decided that they
cared strongly enough about their groups to pay for their
own housing. Other groups are free to do the same, but no
one has the right to claim that the University "gave" fra
ternities their houses.
I hope that this letter has clarified this one issue more
clearly: it is unfortunate that someone from the fraternal
system must clarify misinformation and stereotypes per
petrated by The Daily editorial board. In the future I hope
that a more responsible style of journalism is pursued by
The Daily.

My congratulations to The Daily editorial board for
once again completely slandering and misrepresenting
fraternities on campus. This has been going on for quite
some time now, but Tuesday's editorial "Take housing
from frats" reached a pinnacle in poor journalism.
• Not only was the editorial uncalled for, given the
"witch-hunt" bias of (he piece, but the information pre
sented within ran from hearsay to complete speculation.
The Delta Upsilons' recent escapades are inexecusable,
but that does not warrant The Daily printing that the DUs
"the same night" as the incident with the two freshmen,
"lit a couch on fire . . ." when in fact the incident with the

DAVID NORTHW AY

couch occurred two nights later. The University has
hardly just "s(a)t back and considered)" the recent ac
tions of the DUs. Obviously, if anyone on the editorial
board had cared to investigate, the DUs' behavior is being
looked into by both the University and the Interfraternity
Council (IFC), with action having already been taken
against them by the University.
• Claiming that there "lurks a tradition of sexism and
elitism in all the fraternities." After mentioning only one
sentence earlier that "of course, all fraternities are not the
same," how can the editorial board go on to make such a
simplisitic, generalized, naive statement? Does this mean
that my friends in Columbae, by virtue of living in a house
stereotyped as "earth mamas" all do drugs and have vi
sions of overthrowing the capitalist machine? Does this
sound ridiculous? Well then, you in the Stanford commu
nity now know how a fraternity member feels when The
Daily makes such stereotypical statements against our sys
tem.
The argument that fraternities unfairly have beautiful
houses while others wallow in University dorm accommo
dations goes something like this, according to The Daily:
Fraternities have nice houses, we don't. If fraternities
want their own houses, why don't they just move off
campus and buy one and let the rest of us live in their
great housing? Do people know why our houses are so
wonderful and in great shape, why we "monopolize a
central and desirable part of student housing?" Because a
long time ago when groups of men on campus realized life
could be more fun living together with a group of close
friends they did buy "houses off campus" in what was
then the old Row. Fraternities organized themselves on
this campus and paid for houses on this campus with their
own money.
Unfortunately, in the 19505, as the campus was expand
