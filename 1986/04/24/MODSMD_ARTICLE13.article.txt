'World Culture":
where will it end?
1 cannot help but applaud the
recent and well-orchestrated crusade
against the Western Culture program
at Stanford. The wit and wisdom of
these "learned" students have cer
tainly brought profound insights to an
argument that, to those familiar with
Stanford's history, must be rather
stale. Yes. who can argue with the
need for a new non-Western Culture
track that will not offend the eternally
nebulous and ever-expanding
"people of color."

Of course, new authors will have to
be found to replace those in the old
syllabi, so perhaps a set of guidelines
should be established.
• The writers cannot be males of
European descent, regardless of skin
tone.
• Said authors must have lived and
died in cultures that have never been
influenced and therefore corrupted
by Western civilization.
• These philosophers must have a
written language to be learned by all
students so as not to necessitate a
reliance upon translators who might
have been tainted by Western influ
ence.

• Finally, a fair representation must
he found from all designated peoples
of color, which is to say that two
Chinese authors cannot compensate
for the absence of a Tongan Islander.

Welcome refugees
in native tongue
Yesterday, as 1 was returning to
campus I noticed the sign at the
beginning of Palm Drive designating

Stanford as a "Sanctuary for Central
American Refugees." It struck me as
odd that the sign is in English and not
Spanish. A sign printed in Spanish
would certainly serve its assumed
purpose more effectively — unless, of
course, the purpose of the sign is
really just a statement aimed at the
Palo Alto community and not Central
American refugees. A sign in Spanish
would at least be a symbolic touch to
welcome any refugees. Hopefully,
displaying the sign in English was just
an oversight.
