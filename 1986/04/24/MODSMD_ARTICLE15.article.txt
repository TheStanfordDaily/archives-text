# Speaking in fiery tongues
## 
### 
For a stretch of time, before you really think about what
the voices are saying, you are conscious only of the light.
It comes in low, like a plane, strafing you through the
windshield, and paints the car seat and the buildings and
the streets as you move through it towards the end of the
afternoon. The voices are the radio ("So you agree we had
to do it?"), and they seep into the car's interior, the
mind's interior (" Yes, we had to do it, I mean I'm sorry
if) gradually, through the filter of the warmth, the other
thoughts, and the indelible clarity of the streets, beaches
of asphalt sparkling in that pumpkin light.
Some of the voices are belligerent ("Oh, so what you're
telling me is that because we're America we can do any
thing we want, is that it?"), some callous ("/ mean I'm
sorry about the innocent people getting killed, and all, but
we ..."). You listen in wonder at the discourse of ordi-

nary Americans. The moderator is Against; the rest of the
citizenry appears to be For, and it is interesting at first,
until the awful illogic of both sides begins to undermine
you in a way you would be hard pressed to explain.
People in cars on either side of you at the stoplight. Of
course there are. Just like you, people inside cars, going
places. On the right, a woman is frowning slightly against
the glare. She looks stern, purposeful. On the left is a sil
ver Porsche, \ftith lines cool as wraparound shades, ovoid
and rounded like an insect, and you can't see the man,
merely a forearm, hand and cigarette, crisp white shirt
rolled up to the elbow, briefcase on the seat beside him.
Smoke from the cigarette pouring slow as honey in a lan
guid curl from between the man's fingers.
The voices on the radio are faint now, but they are sup
planted by others. Your friend wringing his big hands and
laughing a little, embarrassed that he hasn't kept up with
the the issues better ("I don't know anything about this, I
mean don't know anything, but it just seems terrible"):
your professor, tucking down the corners of his mouth and
shaking his head ("It's not the end of something. It's the
beginning of something"); your professor's academic
detractors ("I think he stated the case too strongly. 1 don't
think anything's going to come of it. Even in the event of a
land invasion, it would make no sense for the Soviets to
support them. Strategically, the area just isn't important
enough for them to risk any kind of large-scale conflict")',
a guest lecturer's brief comment, made almost sadly ("If
you 're going to strike' against the sna ke, you 'd better kill the
snake"). Voices. You give each of them a fair hearing.
Watching Weinberger and Shultz the other night, you
felt, on top of the horrible wrongness of it all, the desper
ate craving to know more than they were telling you. Did
they really not know? You supposed not. Things were
happening on the other side of the world, miles above a
nighttime desert, and they just didn't know yet. Or at least
the media didn't. But for once, even Weinberger and
Shultz were strangely eager to claim ignorance ("We
have as yet received no word"), articulating their points
with unusual care; and while their finely calibrated lan
guage suggested their utter confidence that the situation

would be favorably resolved, you got the uneasy feeling of
being poised on the edge of something that no one really
understood yet.
A woman's voice is on the radio now, the first female
voice to speak that afternoon. "I just can't help feeling that
people think this is some kind of movie," she says."And /
think Reagan is fostering that idea." "I aree, I agree," says
the DJ. "Well, I'm glad, hut apparently a lot of your lis
teners don't agree, they think it's some kind of, I don't
know, game or something. But these people aren't actors,
they aren t going to get up and ha ve parts in other movies.
There is silence on the air for a moment. "I just think ..."
She lets out a breath. "I'm just really afraid this could he it,
you know?"
This is becoming grave, and not entirely rational, you're
sure,'and suddenly rationality is very important. You want
the most logical, knowledgeable people you know to tell
you there are constraints you don't know about, strictures
that will keep anything really bad from happening. The
closest you can get to this is a voice from the front of one
of your classes pointing out that a formal declaration of
war may at least prevent cruelty by laying down rules of
conduct permissible within the parameters of armed con
flict ("War is, in many ways," he says, "a very civilized
thing"). You reach for the radio knob just as they cut to a
commercial. "Gals," says a man's voice, "let's talk about
shopping for clothes." You kill the radio and continue
back to campus, carried along on the comfortable hum of
the car's suspension.
But the voices keep talking late into the night, past din
ner, past a brief stint at the library, past the casualty
reports which finally come in around midnight and con
firm the reality of what's happened. You sit in the dark
ened room and listen. People in pajamas in the streets.
Ruined houses, torn open to expose blackened walls and
charred furniture. A hospital bed, and the boy in it, his
limbs now heavy lumps of bandage, only his eyes visible in
a strip of flesh surrounded by gauze.
There is some liquor in the room, and you drink some
of it to relax : but even when the alcohol starts opening up
a space inside your head, you can't beat back the energy
pouring through you, and you pull on some shorts and
running shoes and head downstairs. By this time it's late,
somewhere around 3 a.m., and you take off at an abnor
mally fast pace for a quick circuit of the lake. The effect of
the alcohol is to distill things down to their most basic
components, and everything is clear and loud, like some
body's turned up the volume on the world. You hurt in
your stomach and your temples, and you recognize the
stupidity of this kind of self-abuse, but the more it hurts,
the faster you run, until suddenly you are hearing all the
voices again, speaking to you in the language of solutions
political and military, each well-turned phrase gleaming
and strong as a precision tool, and as you tear through the
night, you think that war is in many ways a very civilized
thing, and that if you strike the snake you'd better kill the
snake, and that this is not the end of something, but the
beginning of something, even if you want no part of that
beginning and reject it with all the strength you have.
You slow to a walk, pluming smoke and dripping, your
hands and face suddenly engorged with blood in the cold
air. Sanctions, you think to yourself. Reprisals. Incursions.
Back in your room, you towel yourself dry and sit down
on the bed. A pulse thumps in your head, and your flesh is
still damp against the sheet. At some point sleep takes you
as you sit there, waiting on the morning, watching the
earth turn light.

nighttime desert, and they just didn't know yet. Or at least
the media didn't. But for once, even Weinberger and
Shultz were strangely eager to claim ignorance ("We
have as yet received no word"), articulating their points
with unusual care; and while their finely calibrated lan
guage suggested their utter confidence that the situation

would be favorably resolved, you got the uneasy feeling of
being poised on the edge of something that no one really
understood yet.
A woman's voice is on the radio now, the first female
voice to speak that afternoon. "I just can't help feeling that
people think this is some kind of movie," she says."And /
think Reagan is fostering that idea." "I aree, I agree," says
the DJ. "Well, I'm glad, hut apparently a lot of your lis
teners don't agree, they think it's some kind of, I don't
know, game or something. But these people aren't actors,
they aren t going to get up and ha ve parts in other movies.
There is silence on the air for a moment. "I just think ..."
She lets out a breath. "I'm just really afraid this could he it,
you know?"
This is becoming grave, and not entirely rational, you're
sure,'and suddenly rationality is very important. You want
the most logical, knowledgeable people you know to tell
you there are constraints you don't know about, strictures
that will keep anything really bad from happening. The
closest you can get to this is a voice from the front of one
of your classes pointing out that a formal declaration of
war may at least prevent cruelty by laying down rules of
conduct permissible within the parameters of armed con
flict ("War is, in many ways," he says, "a very civilized
thing"). You reach for the radio knob just as they cut to a
commercial. "Gals," says a man's voice, "let's talk about
shopping for clothes." You kill the radio and continue
back to campus, carried along on the comfortable hum of
the car's suspension.
But the voices keep talking late into the night, past din
ner, past a brief stint at the library, past the casualty
reports which finally come in around midnight and con
firm the reality of what's happened. You sit in the dark
ened room and listen. People in pajamas in the streets.
Ruined houses, torn open to expose blackened walls and
charred furniture. A hospital bed, and the boy in it, his
limbs now heavy lumps of bandage, only his eyes visible in
a strip of flesh surrounded by gauze.
There is some liquor in the room, and you drink some
of it to relax : but even when the alcohol starts opening up
a space inside your head, you can't beat back the energy
pouring through you, and you pull on some shorts and
running shoes and head downstairs. By this time it's late,
somewhere around 3 a.m., and you take off at an abnor
mally fast pace for a quick circuit of the lake. The effect of
the alcohol is to distill things down to their most basic
components, and everything is clear and loud, like some
body's turned up the volume on the world. You hurt in
your stomach and your temples, and you recognize the
stupidity of this kind of self-abuse, but the more it hurts,
the faster you run, until suddenly you are hearing all the
voices again, speaking to you in the language of solutions
political and military, each well-turned phrase gleaming
and strong as a precision tool, and as you tear through the
night, you think that war is in many ways a very civilized
thing, and that if you strike the snake you'd better kill the
snake, and that this is not the end of something, but the
beginning of something, even if you want no part of that
beginning and reject it with all the strength you have.
You slow to a walk, pluming smoke and dripping, your
hands and face suddenly engorged with blood in the cold
air. Sanctions, you think to yourself. Reprisals. Incursions.
Back in your room, you towel yourself dry and sit down
on the bed. A pulse thumps in your head, and your flesh is
still damp against the sheet. At some point sleep takes you
as you sit there, waiting on the morning, watching the
earth turn light.

For a stretch of time, before you really think about what
the voices are saying, you are conscious only of the light.
It comes in low, like a plane, strafing you through the
windshield, and paints the car seat and the buildings and
the streets as you move through it towards the end of the
afternoon. The voices are the radio ("So you agree we had
to do it?"), and they seep into the car's interior, the
mind's interior (" Yes, we had to do it, I mean I'm sorry
if) gradually, through the filter of the warmth, the other
thoughts, and the indelible clarity of the streets, beaches
of asphalt sparkling in that pumpkin light.
Some of the voices are belligerent ("Oh, so what you're
telling me is that because we're America we can do any
thing we want, is that it?"), some callous ("/ mean I'm
sorry about the innocent people getting killed, and all, but
we ..."). You listen in wonder at the discourse of ordi-

nary Americans. The moderator is Against; the rest of the
citizenry appears to be For, and it is interesting at first,
until the awful illogic of both sides begins to undermine
you in a way you would be hard pressed to explain.
People in cars on either side of you at the stoplight. Of
course there are. Just like you, people inside cars, going
places. On the right, a woman is frowning slightly against
the glare. She looks stern, purposeful. On the left is a sil
ver Porsche, \ftith lines cool as wraparound shades, ovoid
and rounded like an insect, and you can't see the man,
merely a forearm, hand and cigarette, crisp white shirt
rolled up to the elbow, briefcase on the seat beside him.
Smoke from the cigarette pouring slow as honey in a lan
guid curl from between the man's fingers.
The voices on the radio are faint now, but they are sup
planted by others. Your friend wringing his big hands and
laughing a little, embarrassed that he hasn't kept up with
the the issues better ("I don't know anything about this, I
mean don't know anything, but it just seems terrible"):
your professor, tucking down the corners of his mouth and
shaking his head ("It's not the end of something. It's the
beginning of something"); your professor's academic
detractors ("I think he stated the case too strongly. 1 don't
think anything's going to come of it. Even in the event of a
land invasion, it would make no sense for the Soviets to
support them. Strategically, the area just isn't important
enough for them to risk any kind of large-scale conflict")',
a guest lecturer's brief comment, made almost sadly ("If
you 're going to strike' against the sna ke, you 'd better kill the
snake"). Voices. You give each of them a fair hearing.
Watching Weinberger and Shultz the other night, you
felt, on top of the horrible wrongness of it all, the desper
ate craving to know more than they were telling you. Did
they really not know? You supposed not. Things were
happening on the other side of the world, miles above a
nighttime desert, and they just didn't know yet. Or at least
