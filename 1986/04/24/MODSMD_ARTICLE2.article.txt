# DUs to fight IFC decision
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
The president of the Delta Upsilon
fraternity said yesterday that he will
appeal the Interfraternity Council's
decision to revoke the fraternity's
recognition.
Scott Hartman said the DUs did
not receive a fair hearing from the
IFC Review Board, the judicial body
of the IFC. "The decision was ren
dered before our testimony was even
heard," he said, adding that the IFC
seems to impose a different set of
guidelines on the DUs than on other
fraternities.
The IFC decided Tuesday to
revoke recognition of the DUs for
two years. After that period, the fra
ternity could petition to regain IFC
recognition under probationary status
for six months, after which time the
IFC would vote whether to reinstate
full recognition to the fraternity.
The IFC also recommended the
University disband the fraternity and
take away its house.
In a letter delivered Tuesday to
Hartman, the board cited an April 12
incident in which a burning couch was
thrown off a third-floor balcony of
the DU house as an indication of the
deeper problems facing the DUs.
In that incident, two members of
the DU house dragged a couch to the
third floor balcony. Despite instuc
tions from Hartman to stop, one of
the two lit the couch on fire and threw
it off the balcony. The individual re
sponsible for the act has been disas
sociated from the house, Hartman
told The Daily last week.
The board wrote Hartman that
since there were several members of
the fraternity present at the time of
the incident who were aware of the
intentions of the members, the action
was not individual.
In an interview with The Daily last
night. TFC President "Don GalTes'sard
the incident demonstrated a "lack of
follow-through" by Hartman to make
sure the fraternity member did not
throw the couch off the balcony. The
incident indicates that the DUs still
have problems, Galles said.
"The DUs don't understand what
collective responsibility means," he
said.
Hartman said, however, that the
action was not condoned by the mem
bers of the fraternity. He added that

the DUs acted responsibly in their
handling of the incident. "I feel the
entire house should not have to suffer
the consequences of one guy's ac
tions," he said.
The DUs will appeal the IFC deci
sion to the IFC Executive Council,
which is composed of representatives
of all the fraternitites, instead of to
the IFC Review Board, according to
Hartman. Since representatives of
unhoused fraternities compose one
third of the six-member board, a con
flict of interest resulted, Hartman
said.
Unhoused fraternities favored
revoking DU recognition in the hopes
that they would be given the DU
house, he said, adding that he hoped
the DUs would receive a less biased
view from the executive council.
According to Galles, however,
Hartman's accusations of board bias
are unfounded. The two unhoused
members of the board are from
predominantly black fraternities,
which have no interest in receiving
housing. Gall., said.
Row Direc . Diana Conklin said
there exists no possibility that an
other fraternity would be given the
DUs' house.
According to Galles, the DUs can
obtain another hearing with the IFC
Review Board by convincing him that
there exists information the IFC
overlooked in revoking recognition of
the fraternity or that the IFC decision
was unfair. If the appeal was warran
ted, Galles said he would ask the IFC
to launch another investigation.
Although Hartman said the
prospects of the DUs not losing their
house look "pretty grim," he said he
feels the fraternity would continue to
exist even if the University follows
the IFC recommendation and
revokes DU recognition. "The senti
ment is we want to stick together and
keep the tradition going."
Hartman said he hoped the Uni
versity would reach its decision re
garding the fate of the DUs by the
time Rush bids are issued early next
week. However, Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano said the Univer
sity needed time to consider the is
sues carefully.
If the DUs lose University recogni
tion, their house would probably be
opened to the Draw, according to
Residential Housing Director Rodger
Whitney.

tions," he said.
The DUs will appeal the IFC deci
sion to the IFC Executive Council,
which is composed of representatives
of all the fraternitites, instead of to
the IFC Review Board, according to
Hartman. Since representatives of
unhoused fraternities compose one
third of the six-member board, a con
flict of interest resulted, Hartman
said.
Unhoused fraternities favored
revoking DU recognition in the hopes
that they would be given the DU
house, he said, adding that he hoped
the DUs would receive a less biased
view from the executive council.
According to Galles, however,
Hartman's accusations of board bias
are unfounded. The two unhoused
members of the board are from
predominantly black fraternities,
which have no interest in receiving
housing. Gall., said.
Row Direc . Diana Conklin said
there exists no possibility that an
other fraternity would be given the
DUs' house.
According to Galles, the DUs can
obtain another hearing with the IFC
Review Board by convincing him that
there exists information the IFC
overlooked in revoking recognition of
the fraternity or that the IFC decision
was unfair. If the appeal was warran
ted, Galles said he would ask the IFC
to launch another investigation.
Although Hartman said the
prospects of the DUs not losing their
house look "pretty grim," he said he
feels the fraternity would continue to
exist even if the University follows
the IFC recommendation and
revokes DU recognition. "The senti
ment is we want to stick together and
keep the tradition going."
Hartman said he hoped the Uni
versity would reach its decision re
garding the fate of the DUs by the
time Rush bids are issued early next
week. However, Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano said the Univer
sity needed time to consider the is
sues carefully.
If the DUs lose University recogni
tion, their house would probably be
opened to the Draw, according to
Residential Housing Director Rodger
Whitney.
