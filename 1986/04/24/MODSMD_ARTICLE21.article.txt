## 'Legend' brings unicorns and goblins to life Director Ridley Scott creates a vibrant fairytale world for children and adults 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
Ridley Scott's new film "Legend"
opens with the portentous flapdoodle
characteristic of most of today's fan
tasy films and novels.
Long ago, we are solemnly in
formed, before there was even such a
thing as time, a balance was struck in
our world between good and evil. The
fearsome Lord of Darkness would

have dearly loved to take over the
world, but those creatures who are
entirely pure prevented him from
gaining the upper hand.
Ho-hum. This is watered-down
Tolkien — "Lord of the Rings"
reduced to simplicities.
In "Legend" the only pure
creatures are unicorns. The big, bad
Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) sends
out his goblin henchmen to slay
whatever unicorns they can find, so

that he can assert his power over the
world forevermore. The goblins,
being an - obedient bunch of fellows,
duly set out from their master's
mountain fortress and proceed to the
seemingly enchanted forest where the
unicorns romp around together. Also
living in the forest is a noble young
savage, Jack (Tom Cruise). Jack is
occasionally visited in his wooded
haunts by his lover, Princess Lili (Mia
Sara).
Things go badly for Jack when the
goblins invade the forest. They chop
off one unicorn's horn, thereby killing
it, and capture another, the last such
creature alive. They drag the unicorn,
along with the Princess, back to their
master's dark abode. What can Jack
do but follow along?
Surprisingly, "Legend" is a very
entertaining movie. Scott and writer
William Hjortsberg have presented
their fantasy world with straight
faces, without any trace of irony or
camp humor, and it works. Here
there are fairies, goblins, pixies and
unicorns, but never does the material
get embarrassing or childish.
This is mostly due to the fact that
Scott and his army of make-up artists,
costume men and set designers have
made their fantasy so convincingly
real. To say that this is a good
looking movie would be an under
statement. The operative word here is
lush — the unicorns inhabit a world
which is beautiful beyond description.
Luscious foliage, sparkling pools,
gleaming shafts of sunlight — produc
tion designer Assheton Gorton must
have overdosed on Maxfield Parrish
prints.
Equally striking is the Lord of
Darkness's mountain retreat, a
labyrinth of shadowy ruins and huge,
sinister arabesque columns.

None of these spectacular sets
should come as any surprise, since
after all, Scott is the film's director.
Scott is the film world's reigning vis
ual stylist. Every frame of his films
screams out his art-school training.
In his underrated 1982 film "Blade
Runner," Scott created a world of
chic futuristic decay which has since
been ripped off by countless other
science-fiction films and rock videos.
Here he takes William Hjortsberg's
capable script and brings it to life with
typically sumptuous visuals.
Contributing to all this aesthetic
splendor is Sara in her film debut as
Princess Lili. She fits the role of the
cheerful young princess perfectly, just
as Cruise wears his role of the heroic
Jack as easily as he wears his gleam
ing gold armor. Jack and Lili are bet
ter seen not as real characters but
tried-and-true archetypes. They
manage to be recognizable figures
without ever lapsing into pure cliche.
Furthermore, they are never over
whelmed by the sound and fury going
on around them — no mean feat.
The fact that Cruise and Sara are
never overshadowed is especially im
pressive when one considers what an
interesting group all the assorted
goblins, demons and fairies are. The
goblins continually bicker among
themselves, as is to be expected of
such a venal bunch. A surprising bit
of humor comes when one goblin is
condemned to a bottomless pit by the
Lord of Darkness: rather than
struggle he lets out a chipper " Adios,
amigos" and plunges downward.
Even better is a hideous green sea
creature which prepares to devour
Cruise at one point. When Jack asks,
"You don't really plan to eat me, do
you?" the monster replies, "Oh,
indeed I do," with such exaggerated

relish that you can't help but love
him.
As the Lord of Darkness, Tim
Curry is unrecognizable in his thick
red make-up, huge musculature and
giant horns. Curry's bizarre appear
ance and grandiose manner make the
Lord of Darkness a seriously impos
ing guy. When he bears down on a
helpless Jack in slow-motion at the
film's climax, it seems impossible that
Cruise will ever live to make another
movie.
"Legend" is complemented by a
moody, shimmering Tangerine
Dream score. Director Scott picks his
musical scores well: "Blade Runner"
used Vangelis' synthesizers to good
effect, and here Tangerine Dream is
evocative without ever being
obtrusive.

By now this business of every
movie having a pop 'theme' is getting
a little silly, but Bryan Ferry's contri
bution to "Legend" is a small gem.
Ferry sounds as lachrymose as ever —
some people will never cheer up —
but his grave romanticism is perfectly
in keeping with the film's lush, sen
suous feel.
While seeing "Legend," 1 was
struck by how perfectly right it all
seemed. The unicorns are as stately
and majestic as you'd expect them to
be, the evil fortress is as neatly creepy
as you could possibly imagine, the
climax is as satisfying as you could
hope. Scott has said that he wanted to
make a fairy-tale for his own
children; in doing so he's tapped into
the stuff of which legends are made.


Annabelle Lanyon plays Oona, the fairy capable of transforming her
self into a human being, in "Legend." This, obviously, is not her human
form.


Goblin leader Blix (Alice Playten) and pig-faced cohort Pox (Peter
O'Farrel) are two of the bad guys in director Ridley Scott's new film
"Legend."
