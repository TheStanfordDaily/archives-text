## Surging Stanford battles maladies 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
As a reward for a job well done
against USC last Saturday, many of
the Stanford women's tennis players
are vacationing in Ojai today through
Sunday.
Well, no. Actually, the Cardinal is
competing in the Ojai Intercollegiate
during its stay in Southern California.
But, as prestigious as this individual
tournament is, it should be a picnic
compared with the pressure-packed
dual matches the Cardinal has been
playing recently.
"It's not a dual match, so you don't
have that kind of pressure," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said. "They
(the players) go to Ojai and play and
they can relax. They don't have to
worry about, 'If I lose, the team will
lose."'
Though the Intercollegiate is an in
dividual tournament, in the past team
standings have been recorded. Last
season, Stanford took home the team
trophy.
Through a quirk in the NCAA
rules, however, the team competition
may be discarded this year.
The NCAA's 35 Rule states that
no team can play more than 35
matches in a season. If team points
are counted in Ojai, each day's com
petition will be considered one
match. If not, the entire tournament
will be recorded as one match. For
teams that are near the 35 limit, the
latter would be more desirable.
Abandoning the team aspect of the
Intercollegiate would be "a shame",
according to Brennan. "They have a

nice trophy and a nice tradition," he
said.
Juniors Patty Fendick and Leigh
Anne Eldredge will compete in the
intercollegiate singles beginning
today. Eldredge advanced to the
semifinals in this division last year
before losing to (JSC's Cecilia Fer
nandez. Fendick captured the singles
championship last season in the open
division. Two years ago, Eldredge
defeated Fendick in the finals of the
intercollegiate singles.
The Cardinal's entry in the inter
collegiate doubles division will be
junior Stephanie Savides and sopho
more Cari Hagey. The pair plays No.
2 on the Stanford team and, last Sat
urday, clinched the 5-4 victory over
use.
Freshmen Marianne Werdel and
Sonya Kazazian are scheduled to play
in the open singles, but Werdel is
doubtful due to illness. Kazazian will
team with senior co-captain Susan
Ross in the open doubles.
Not competing for the Cardinal in
Ojai are sophomore Kay Tittle and
senior Alyce Werdel. Tittle has been
ill since the night before the USC
match, and Werdel has a foot injury.
Card notes
Brennan announced that Stanford's
match at Pepperdine on May 3 has
been cancelled. The Waves finish
school this week, and because they
don't expect to be invited to the
NCAA championships, they have
chosen not to play out the rest of their
schedule.
The Cardinal's only remaining dual
match before the NCAA Champion
ships is May 2 at UCLA.


After making the semifinals of the Ojai Intercollegiate last year, Leigh
Anne Eldredge will be looking to go even farther this time around. She

will be joined in the singles draw by teammate Patty Fendick, whom
Eldredge defeated two seasons ago in the finals of the tournament.
