# Marquess wins games, respect
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
It's a warm sunny afternoon. The stands of
Sunken Diamond are full of students sunning
themselves. But that's the last thing on your
mind.
The count is three and two. You throw your
best pitch. "Ball four," the plate umpire bel
lows. You've just loaded the bases. A base hit
could lose the game for you.
Your teammates join you on the mound. Out

of the dugout comes your coach. He looks like
he should be out in the field playing, not sitting
in the dugout. He gives you a few words of ad
vice, and then slaps you on the back before he
trots off the infield.
Somewhere you once heard a saying: "Those
who can't do, coach." But you know better than
to believe that. Your coach is the Cardinal's
Mark Marquess. In nine years as skipper of the
Cardinal baseball team, he has become the win
ningest coach in Stanford baseball history.
Marquess graduated from the Farm in 1969

with a degree in political science. Before
graduating, the two-time Ali-American
managed to rewrite the Stanford baseball
record book.
"It's a special feeling being able to come back
to your college and coach," Marquess said.
'Tve spent half of my adult life here. Stanford is
definitely a part of my life."
Seventeen years after he last played for the
Cardinal, he is still eighth in career batting
average (.333) and third in career triples (15).
He is one of only 21 baseball players ever to be
inducted into the school's Hall of Fame.
Marquess led his squad to the 1967 College
World Series and helped the then-Indians finish
third. He racked up a .404 average during that
series. Today that figure remains the fourth best
in school history for World Series play.
Marquess also pitched and caught . . . foot
balls, that is. When he wasn't stealing bases in
Sunken Diamond, Marquess was playing foot
ball for Coach John Ralston. The two-sport star
was a quarterback, a split end. a defensive back
and a punt returner.
After graduation, Marquess headed for the
professional ranks. He was picked up by the
Chicago White Sox organization. After a few
years of Double-A and Triple-A ball, the
former Stanford star decided to try life outside
the white lines.
In 1971. Marquess was hired by Coach Ray
Young as a baseball assistant. Five years later,
Young moved upstairs to become Associate
Director of Athletics, and Marquess was named
the new head coach.
Despite not fufilling a dream of becoming a
big-leaguer, Marquess was happy to come back
to the Farm.
In his nine years, Marquess' teams have
posted a .656 winning percentage. They also
have made trips to the College World Series in
three of the last four seasons.
Marquess attributed his success to a combina
tion of motivation on his part and hard work on
his players' part.
"I don't consider myself a better coach than
anyone else," he said. "We have been fortunate
to get good athletes, and I try to get them to
work extra hard and give all they've got at each
game. You win through hard work."
There are times, though, when the pressures
of a big game in a "must win" situation required
strategy. Marquess overlooks the stress.
"This year has been more difficult from a
coach's standpoint," he said. "I haven't had a
set lineup. It's more of a challenge. But usually,
I can count on the players to come through."
Marquess' view of his abilities as a coach may
be somewhat modest, according to junior third
baseman Ruben Amaro.
"Coach Marquess is the most thorough coach
I have ever played for," Amaro said. "He
covers every base. In practice we work on just
about every situation that could happen. We'll
go over double play balls in the same proportion
that we'll do regular grounders. It's this perfec
tionism which makes him successful. Coach
Marquess will never have a team that will lay
down and die."'
Having such great success makes it seem as if
Stanford has had nothing but talent-laden
teams. Marquess disagrees.
" A lot of the teams I've had had a lot of suc
cess with haven't had the most talent. In 1983,
we made it to the Series with a team that didn't
have the most talent. We just worked hard."
Marquess added that he gets a lot of satisfac
tion coaching players whose career interests lie
in other areas than professional sports.
"It's rewarding coaching players who want to
become doctors or lawyers rather than pro ath
letes." he said. "You can still get good results
from players who don't want to be pushed to the
majors."

third. He racked up a .404 average during that
series. Today that figure remains the fourth best
in school history for World Series play.
Marquess also pitched and caught . . . foot
balls, that is. When he wasn't stealing bases in
Sunken Diamond, Marquess was playing foot
ball for Coach John Ralston. The two-sport star
was a quarterback, a split end. a defensive back
and a punt returner.
After graduation, Marquess headed for the
professional ranks. He was picked up by the
Chicago White Sox organization. After a few
years of Double-A and Triple-A ball, the
former Stanford star decided to try life outside
the white lines.
In 1971. Marquess was hired by Coach Ray
Young as a baseball assistant. Five years later,
Young moved upstairs to become Associate
Director of Athletics, and Marquess was named
the new head coach.
Despite not fufilling a dream of becoming a
big-leaguer, Marquess was happy to come back
to the Farm.
In his nine years, Marquess' teams have
posted a .656 winning percentage. They also
have made trips to the College World Series in
three of the last four seasons.
Marquess attributed his success to a combina
tion of motivation on his part and hard work on
his players' part.
"I don't consider myself a better coach than
anyone else," he said. "We have been fortunate
to get good athletes, and I try to get them to
work extra hard and give all they've got at each
game. You win through hard work."
There are times, though, when the pressures
of a big game in a "must win" situation required
strategy. Marquess overlooks the stress.
"This year has been more difficult from a
coach's standpoint," he said. "I haven't had a
set lineup. It's more of a challenge. But usually,
I can count on the players to come through."
Marquess' view of his abilities as a coach may
be somewhat modest, according to junior third
baseman Ruben Amaro.
"Coach Marquess is the most thorough coach
I have ever played for," Amaro said. "He
covers every base. In practice we work on just
about every situation that could happen. We'll
go over double play balls in the same proportion
that we'll do regular grounders. It's this perfec
tionism which makes him successful. Coach
Marquess will never have a team that will lay
down and die."'
Having such great success makes it seem as if
Stanford has had nothing but talent-laden
teams. Marquess disagrees.
" A lot of the teams I've had had a lot of suc
cess with haven't had the most talent. In 1983,
we made it to the Series with a team that didn't
have the most talent. We just worked hard."
Marquess added that he gets a lot of satisfac
tion coaching players whose career interests lie
in other areas than professional sports.
"It's rewarding coaching players who want to
become doctors or lawyers rather than pro ath
letes." he said. "You can still get good results
from players who don't want to be pushed to the
majors."

Mark Marquess has devoted a significant part of his life to Stanford baseball, with consid
erable success. As a player, he led the Cardinal to the 1967 College World Series, and he
has a .656 winning percentage as Stanford's coach.
It's a warm sunny afternoon. The stands of
Sunken Diamond are full of students sunning
themselves. But that's the last thing on your
mind.
The count is three and two. You throw your
best pitch. "Ball four," the plate umpire bel
lows. You've just loaded the bases. A base hit
could lose the game for you.
Your teammates join you on the mound. Out

of the dugout comes your coach. He looks like
he should be out in the field playing, not sitting
in the dugout. He gives you a few words of ad
vice, and then slaps you on the back before he
trots off the infield.
Somewhere you once heard a saying: "Those
who can't do, coach." But you know better than
to believe that. Your coach is the Cardinal's
Mark Marquess. In nine years as skipper of the
Cardinal baseball team, he has become the win
ningest coach in Stanford baseball history.
Marquess graduated from the Farm in 1969

with a degree in political science. Before
graduating, the two-time Ali-American
managed to rewrite the Stanford baseball
record book.
"It's a special feeling being able to come back
to your college and coach," Marquess said.
'Tve spent half of my adult life here. Stanford is
definitely a part of my life."
Seventeen years after he last played for the
Cardinal, he is still eighth in career batting
average (.333) and third in career triples (15).
He is one of only 21 baseball players ever to be
inducted into the school's Hall of Fame.
