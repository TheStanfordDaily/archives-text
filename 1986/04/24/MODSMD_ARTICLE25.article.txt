# Who will win in this season's draw game?
## 
### 
They come from most everywhere —
determined, primed, ready to kick
some proverbial tush.
It is known quite simply as "The
Draw," a bold title that most dread
with a passion.
Hopefully, this bureaucratic
Amityville Horror emulates the world
of sports — the thrill of victory, the
agony of defeat. For instance, "The
Draw" has a lot of little (and some sub
stantial) numbers to throw around and
analyze. Call it statistics. Very
sportslike.

Pulling an 4,976 correlates to rolling
a two in bowling. A number 60
matches nicely to a triple-20 in darts.
Add two to 298, and you're batting
.300. Numbers are fun.
Clearly, the parallels between sports
and"The Draw" are tremendous. In
fact, the final common thread — super
stition — solidifies this uncanny bond.
Like St. John's Basketball Coach
Lou Carnesecca, who wears the same
ugly sweater before every crucial game,
Stanford students often offer sacrifices
to the deity Lady Luck.
According to one Draw helper, some
bring stuffed animals to ward off those
demonic 4,000s lurking in the Old Un
ion corridors. One person brought "a
lucky $100 bill." If only Little Looie
had that sort of money — he could buy
a parka.
Overall, most would-be drawers
(people, not underwear) foster their
own indivdual sensations of nirvana

and "go with the power of the mind,"
as Kathleen Hallinan put it.
Hallinan, the selector for a group of
six, went for the middle of the barrel,
and amid chants of "four, four, four,"
acknowledged that she had pulled what
her group desperately wanted —
2,402. Yes, she received that coveted
four. Oh, how she earned it.
I waited and watched. These were
well-prepared athletes, honing their
drawing skills.
Sophomore John Pacheco, who has
decided to redshirt next year (sports
lingo for unguaranteed), figured that
"the guiding force" will pull him to the
right number.
Beforehand, Pacheco decided that
the middle area was the place to pick
from because "it seems like all good
things are in the center."
With a causal bravado, Pacheco
strutted up to the rotating cylinder and
calmly yanked the number 3,637. "I
drew in the middle — right where it felt
good," he said wryly.
Likewise, freshman Eric Jorgenson,
"the unluckiest person of his group,"
said that he would go "right for the
middle — it has to be right there."
Some people like junior Lily Chang
do very little preseason training for the
big event, nary a rabbit's foot nor pre
liminary drawing strategy. Naturally,
Chang and company drew 4,392. It's
cruel, I know, but to keep with a sports
theme, training is always recom
mended.
After all, Asst. Dean of Student Af
fairs and Director of Housing Rodger
Whitney said that he would go for the
center and "wait for a certain feeling,
then pull that envelope."
Regardless of what hypothetical
number he selected, Whitney, who is
