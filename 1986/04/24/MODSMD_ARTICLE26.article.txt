UCLA has defeated the Stanford men's
volleyball team twice this season. Unfor
tunately, UCLA is the team that the Card
inal must face tonight in the first game of
the NCAA West Regional.
Stanford is the No. 4 seed in the tourna
ment after finishing fifth in the California
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association
with a 12-8 league record. UCLA is the
No. I seed following a coin flip between
the Bruins and Hawaii, who finished the
season tied for second with 15-5 marks.
The Cardinal home loss to UCLA was
probably the most exciting match of the
season, as Stanford fell in five games 17-
19, 15-5, 15-10. 8-15, 12-15. That same
night, outside hitter Chris Braun collected
an unbelievable 49 kills, and senior Jon
Root also totalled his season high of 28
kills in the losing cause.
Tonight the two teams will meet on
neutral ground — Loyola Marymount in
Marina Del Rey. The match begins at 6
p.m.
The Bruins are led by junior Asbjorn

Volstad, a native of Forde, Norway, who
has 329 kills and a .366 hitting
percentage. Fellow junior Jeff Williams is
second with 276 kills to go along with a
.276 average and 30 service aces. Sopho
more Don Dendinger leads the squad in
blocks with 34 solos and 125 block assists.
"UCLA's strength is their serving and
their blocking,'" Stanford Co-coach Fred
Sturm said. "Our ability to slow down
their scoring rate will be a key factor, as
will our ability to be consistent siding out
and converting on point-scoring opportu
nities.
'We played well against Pepperdine,"
UCLA Coach Al Skates said. "We're
peaking right now. I think we're playing
our best volleyball of the season. We're
confident."
"We'd really like to go down there, play
well and knock them out of the tourna
ment," Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw
said."They're a good team, they always
have been, but they rely too much on their
past and tradition. We're going to go out
and play our best to beat the team on the
floor, not countless championships."
