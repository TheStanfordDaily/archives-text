# Cardinal takes depleted squad to Pac-10 tourney
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis team got some
good news and some bad news this week.
The bad news is that Cardinal seniors Dan
Goldie and Jim Grabb are hurt.
The good news is that they can put their feet
up and rest for the remainder of the week.
Today, the rest of the team begins play at the
Pac-10 Individual Championships in Ojai. The
tournament runs through Sunday.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould isn't too con
cerned that Goldie and Grabb probably won't
play this weekend. In fact, Gould is more
worried that the two won't be ready to play in
next week's matches against Pepperdine and
California.
You see, if your main goal is to win the
NCAA team championship, the Pac-10 individ
uals aren't overly important.
"Right now my main concern is that Jim and
Dan will be healthy for next week," Gould said.
"Those two matches are crucial for us as far as
the nationals go."
Currently, the Cardinal is 13-5 on the year
and ranked sixth nationally. Next week's
matches will determine where the team will be
seeded if or when it goes to the NCA As.
Grabb is suffering from a re-injured groin
pull, while Goldie is hobbled by a sprained
ankle. There is still a slight chance that Goldie
will play this weekend.
Those two seniors don't make the whole
team, however. Stanford will still enter six
players in the singles draw and three pairs in the
doubles draw. Gould hopes the competition will
give those players some more experience.
"1 don't know if anvone on mv team has

played in an open tourney this year, and that's
kind of scary, he said. Because of rainouts,
we're still way behind in matches compared to
everyone else.''
Sophomore Patrick McEnroe and senior Eric
Rosenfeld will lead the Cardinal lineup.
McEnroe is the I7th-ranked player in the
country, having moved up over 25 notches in
the month of April.
The New Yorker had won 16 straight singles
matches before losing to USC s Luke Jensen
and UCLA's Michael Kures last weekend.

Rosenfeld, meanwhile, is now the hottest
Cardinal on the courts. The senior from Media,
Penn., has won seven consecutive singles
matches and was the only Stanford player to win
in singles play last week.
A pair of juniors, Scott Moody and Mark
Jacobson, will also enter the singles draw. Both
players will try to use their serve-and-volley
style to overpower their Pac-10 foes.
Rounding out the lineup are senior John
Letts and junior Geordie McK.ee.
Two rather unknown players on the Stanford
squad will make their season debut today.
Curtis Dunn, a freshman from Calabasas, and
Andy Sands, a junior from Los Angeles will
play in the independent collegiate division of
the draw.
