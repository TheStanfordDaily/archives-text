## Features 
### C.R. DOUGLAS Staff writer 
It is news to no one that in recent times public
service has become an increasingly less popular
career choice. What makes news is when students
actually start planning a career in government ser
vice.
This week, Stanford sophomores Mark Lemley
and Gary Rosen were selected as 1986 Truman

Feature

Scholars for their outstanding potential for leader
ship in government. Lemley and Rosen (both na
tional merit scholars) will receive up to $20,000 in
scholarship funds to be used toward careers in
public service.
Named for the 33rd President, Harry S. Truman,
the scholarships are awarded to students who intend
to pursue careers in public service. Up to $5,000 is
given annually for the remainder of the student's
undergraduate career and for up to two years of
graduate study. This covers tuition, fees, books and
room and board.
The 100 Truman Scholarships are awarded an
nually nationwide. For applicants, the selection
process is long and rigorous.
First, Stanford nominates two students who
are then placed in the national competition.
All participating schools nominees are then
evaluated and semifinalists are selected. Each
semifinalist is interviewed in the region in
which they live. The Truman Scholarship
Board then selects one semifinalist from each
state and approximately 50 additional schol
arships are awarded at large.
As a recipient from his home state of Mis
souri, Lemley admits that the scholarship has
given substance to his career plans. After
graduation, Lemley plans to attend law school
at either Boalt Hall at UC-Berkeley or Stan
ford.
Afterwards, he would like to practice civil
liberties law for an agency such as the Depart
ment of Justice. Sometime thereafter he plans
to enter electoral politics.
"When I look back on life 1 want to look
back and say I did something, that I made a
difference. I think politics is a good way to do
that," said Lemley.
As a political science and economics major,
Lemley's interests include civil rights, foreign
policy, trade and military reform. His Truman
Scholarship essay was on U.S. trade policy.
Lemley's activities appear endless. He is
the founder and current president of the Stan
ford Debate Team. Lemley said his responsi
bilities include both coaching and administra
tive details for this 15-20 man team.
Each year Lemley leads his team to 10 state
tournaments. The team recently placed fourth
in the national competition in Reno, Nev. In

addition to the debate team, Lemley co
taught a debate course last quarter through
the Undergraduate Special Programs. Lemley
also works as update editor for The Stanford
Daily.
Active in partisan politics, Lemley is a
former director of the Stanford Democrats,
and still serves on its executive board. As a
freshman, Lemley served as vice-chairman for
Students for Mondale-Ferraro.
Lemley's off-campus activities are
numerous. He is president of the Palo Alto
Democratic Association, a coalition of local
Democrats. He organizes monthly meetings
that focus on such things as voter registration,
upcoming elections and newsletter writing, he
said.
Lemley is also a member of the California
Democratic Central Committee, a group of
200 California Democrats that formulate
policy for the state Democratic Party. In
1984, Lemley was appointed as chairman of
College Democrats for the state of California,
a group representing over 30 campuses
statewide.
While living in Missouri, Lemley was active
in the Gary Hart presidential campaign, coor
dinating precinct walking and phonebanking.
After giving the support speech for Hart at a
local caucus, he was nominated as a delegate
to the state Democratic Convention. Unfor
tunately, he was too young to attend.
With a dorm room decorated in Gary Hart
posters, Lemley has already declared his
loyalty and support to the Hart campaign in
1988. In fact, he has considered the possibility
of graduating early in an effort to join the
campaign early in January of 1988. This sum

mer Lemley plans to work in a St. Louis law
firm.
Truman Scholar Gary Rosen plans to
pursue a career in legislative public policy.
When asked about his interest in politics,
Rosen responded, "It's a real intellectual
challenge, it's a very real and pertinent activ
ity. It seems to me it has a bearing on what
people do."
Currently a political science major, Rosen
plans to use his scholarship to pursue a
master's degree in public administration as
well as a degree in law. Rosen's application
essay was on the issue of comparable worth,
equal pay for men and women for doing the
same job.
Rosen's general interests include public
policy and civil rights. One of his more spe
cific policy pursuits has been welfare reform.
He hopes to gain new insights into this issue
next year when he studies the British
healthcare and welfare systems at Stanford's
Overseas Program in Oxford.
Rosen has been very active since he came
to Stanford. As a freshman he was an associ
ate with the ASSU Senate as well as a mem
ber of Stanford-In-Government's Public
Policy Forum.
This year, Rosen was selected as executive
director of the Public Policy Forum. Under
his leadership the forum has sponsored such
campuswide events as the recent Great Deci
sions symposia, Current Events Forum and
the debate last fall with the national director
of Accuracy in Academia and Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley. In addition, Rosen is
co-editor of the Stanford Commentary, a
quarterly non-partisan political journal.
Rosen's activities have been purposely non

partisan. "In my mind it is important that
there is an exchange of ideas, rather than just
of side of the issue." Recently, Rosen was se
lected as a Stanford-In-Government summer
fellow for an internship in Washington D.C.
with the House Rules Committee.
Part of the scholarship selection process is
based on the nominee's high school public
service activities. In high school Rosen was
active in Youth-In-Government, a program
sponsored by YMCA; as a junior he led his
high school chapter and as a senior he served
as governor of the Texas chapter. In addition,

he was selected as presiding officer at the
YMCA's national affairs conference. Last
summer, Rosen attended the World Ac
tion/International Development Conference
in Montreal, Canada.
In the past six years, 11 of the 12 sopho
mores nominated by Stanford as Truman
Scholars have been selected, according the
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall, who
heads the Truman interviewing committee for
the University. The one sophomore nominee
who was not selected later received a Rhodes
Scholarship.

ate with the ASSU Senate as well as a mem
ber of Stanford-In-Government's Public
Policy Forum.
This year, Rosen was selected as executive
director of the Public Policy Forum. Under
his leadership the forum has sponsored such
campuswide events as the recent Great Deci
sions symposia, Current Events Forum and
the debate last fall with the national director
of Accuracy in Academia and Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley. In addition, Rosen is
co-editor of the Stanford Commentary, a
quarterly non-partisan political journal.
Rosen's activities have been purposely non

partisan. "In my mind it is important that
there is an exchange of ideas, rather than just
of side of the issue." Recently, Rosen was se
lected as a Stanford-In-Government summer
fellow for an internship in Washington D.C.
with the House Rules Committee.
Part of the scholarship selection process is
based on the nominee's high school public
service activities. In high school Rosen was
active in Youth-In-Government, a program
sponsored by YMCA; as a junior he led his
high school chapter and as a senior he served
as governor of the Texas chapter. In addition,

he was selected as presiding officer at the
YMCA's national affairs conference. Last
summer, Rosen attended the World Ac
tion/International Development Conference
in Montreal, Canada.
In the past six years, 11 of the 12 sopho
mores nominated by Stanford as Truman
Scholars have been selected, according the
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall, who
heads the Truman interviewing committee for
the University. The one sophomore nominee
who was not selected later received a Rhodes
Scholarship.

On Monday, sophomores Mark Lemley and Gary Rosen were named Truman
Scholars for 1986. The scholarships are annually given to 100 college sophomores
across the nation and carry a $20,000 award.
It is news to no one that in recent times public
service has become an increasingly less popular
career choice. What makes news is when students
actually start planning a career in government ser
vice.
This week, Stanford sophomores Mark Lemley
and Gary Rosen were selected as 1986 Truman

Feature

Scholars for their outstanding potential for leader
ship in government. Lemley and Rosen (both na
tional merit scholars) will receive up to $20,000 in
scholarship funds to be used toward careers in
public service.
Named for the 33rd President, Harry S. Truman,
the scholarships are awarded to students who intend
to pursue careers in public service. Up to $5,000 is
given annually for the remainder of the student's
undergraduate career and for up to two years of
graduate study. This covers tuition, fees, books and
room and board.
The 100 Truman Scholarships are awarded an
nually nationwide. For applicants, the selection
process is long and rigorous.
First, Stanford nominates two students who
are then placed in the national competition.
All participating schools nominees are then
evaluated and semifinalists are selected. Each
semifinalist is interviewed in the region in
which they live. The Truman Scholarship
Board then selects one semifinalist from each
state and approximately 50 additional schol
arships are awarded at large.
As a recipient from his home state of Mis
souri, Lemley admits that the scholarship has
given substance to his career plans. After
graduation, Lemley plans to attend law school
at either Boalt Hall at UC-Berkeley or Stan
ford.
Afterwards, he would like to practice civil
liberties law for an agency such as the Depart
ment of Justice. Sometime thereafter he plans
to enter electoral politics.
"When I look back on life 1 want to look
back and say I did something, that I made a
difference. I think politics is a good way to do
that," said Lemley.
As a political science and economics major,
Lemley's interests include civil rights, foreign
policy, trade and military reform. His Truman
Scholarship essay was on U.S. trade policy.
Lemley's activities appear endless. He is
the founder and current president of the Stan
ford Debate Team. Lemley said his responsi
bilities include both coaching and administra
tive details for this 15-20 man team.
Each year Lemley leads his team to 10 state
tournaments. The team recently placed fourth
in the national competition in Reno, Nev. In

addition to the debate team, Lemley co
taught a debate course last quarter through
the Undergraduate Special Programs. Lemley
also works as update editor for The Stanford
Daily.
Active in partisan politics, Lemley is a
former director of the Stanford Democrats,
and still serves on its executive board. As a
freshman, Lemley served as vice-chairman for
Students for Mondale-Ferraro.
Lemley's off-campus activities are
numerous. He is president of the Palo Alto
Democratic Association, a coalition of local
Democrats. He organizes monthly meetings
that focus on such things as voter registration,
upcoming elections and newsletter writing, he
said.
Lemley is also a member of the California
Democratic Central Committee, a group of
200 California Democrats that formulate
policy for the state Democratic Party. In
1984, Lemley was appointed as chairman of
College Democrats for the state of California,
a group representing over 30 campuses
statewide.
While living in Missouri, Lemley was active
in the Gary Hart presidential campaign, coor
dinating precinct walking and phonebanking.
After giving the support speech for Hart at a
local caucus, he was nominated as a delegate
to the state Democratic Convention. Unfor
tunately, he was too young to attend.
With a dorm room decorated in Gary Hart
posters, Lemley has already declared his
loyalty and support to the Hart campaign in
1988. In fact, he has considered the possibility
of graduating early in an effort to join the
campaign early in January of 1988. This sum

mer Lemley plans to work in a St. Louis law
firm.
Truman Scholar Gary Rosen plans to
pursue a career in legislative public policy.
When asked about his interest in politics,
Rosen responded, "It's a real intellectual
challenge, it's a very real and pertinent activ
ity. It seems to me it has a bearing on what
people do."
Currently a political science major, Rosen
plans to use his scholarship to pursue a
master's degree in public administration as
well as a degree in law. Rosen's application
essay was on the issue of comparable worth,
equal pay for men and women for doing the
same job.
Rosen's general interests include public
policy and civil rights. One of his more spe
cific policy pursuits has been welfare reform.
He hopes to gain new insights into this issue
next year when he studies the British
healthcare and welfare systems at Stanford's
Overseas Program in Oxford.
Rosen has been very active since he came
to Stanford. As a freshman he was an associ
ate with the ASSU Senate as well as a mem
ber of Stanford-In-Government's Public
Policy Forum.
