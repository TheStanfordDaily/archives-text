# UCLA up next
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff writer 
After being shut out in its last three games, the Stanford
women s softball team will have offense on its mind when
it visits UCLA today in a Pacific West League
doubleheader.
I he Cardinal will hope to break a scoring drought that
has seen Stanford bats fall silent.
"The hitting didn't come through the last time (Pacific
tournament), Stanford third baseman Cathy Domiguez
said. 'We need to relax more. If the defense pulls through
and if we can get some runs across, we'll be okay."
( ardinal centerfielder Margaret Pezzini voiced similiar
optimism, pointing to the fact that UCLA lost a
doublheader to Arizona, a team that Stanford defeated
two weeks ago.
I think we II do well, Pezzini said. "I'm not sure what
they'll (UCLA) think of us."
C hances are the Bruins will be thinking about bringing
back some of last years pitchers. Ihe one-two punch of
Susan Comptom and Debbie Doom gave UCLA an al
most unhittable combination.
This season, the unranked Bruins start a couple of
freshman, who have performed well thus far.
Pezzini expects that UCLA will play "a conservative,
defense-is-the-best-offense" type of game. "When they
get a runner on, they'll try to bunt. They don't go for the
big innings," she said.
Stanford will have starting pitcher Betsy Watson back
in the lineup. Watson, who has missed the lust five games,
will start along with Lisa Buchanan, who pitched and
completed the previous five outings.
After the Bruin series, the Cardinal travels to San
Diego State and Cal State-Northridge, both Division II
schools.
Northridge has captured the Division II national cham
pionship for the last five years and promises to compete
for it this season.
San Diego State should also provide stiff competition.
Last year, the Aztecs hung on to defeat the Cardinal in a
close game.
