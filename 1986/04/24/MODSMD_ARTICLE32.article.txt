Reagan warns against terrorist acts
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yesterday he would use
military force against Iran or Syria if presented with clear evidence that
one of those governments had sponsored an act of terrorism against
Americans.
"State-supported terrorism is a form of warfare and you just can't sit
by and let somebody else declare war on you and pretend that you're at
peace," Reagan told a group of columnists and commentators in the
White House family theater when asked whether he was willing to use
force against Iran or Syria if they sponsored terrorist incidents.
The president said that in many instances it was difficult to obtain the
"irrefutable evidence" he claimed the United States had before its April
14 bombing raid on Libya. But he added that when such v evidence exists,
"we must have the same policy" in dealing with state-supported ter
rorism.
Reagan was then asked whether this meant using force against
Damascus or Tehran. He replied, "Yes, if we had that kind of evidence."
The president's comments came an hour after he issued a sweeping
call for political and economic freedom throughout the world in a speech
to an international forum of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
He combined this message with a stern warning to Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Khadafy that the United States is ready to strike again if
Libya sponsors further acts of terrorism. Reagan and other U.S. officials
have said that the April 14 attack was based on evidence of Libyan re
sponsibility for the bombing of a West Berlin night club in which a U.S.
soldier and a Turkish woman were killed and more than 200 persons
injured.
"By nature, we prefer to solve problems peacefully," Reagan said.
"But as we proved last week, no one can kill Americans and brag about
it. No one. We bear the people of Libya no ill will, but if their govern
ment continues its campaign of terror against Americans, we will act
again."
" Arab nations themselves have been forced to endure terrorist attacks
from this minority," Reagan said. "We hope and pray the Arab world
will join with us to eliminate this scourge on civilization."
House halts covert aid to Angola
WASHINGTON — The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted
yesterday to halt covert U.S. aid to the Angola rebels and require Presi
dent Reagan to seek the approval of Congress for any future assistance
to the resistances forces led by Jonas Savimbi.
vote of 22 to 18, the committee approved the bill authored by
Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) that supporters of the president portrayed
as an attack on the so-called Reagan doctrine of support for anti-
Communist "freedom fighters" around the globe.
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) described the committee vote as an exercise
in "Reagan bashing" by the Democrats and"the death knell for covert
activity" by the United States.
In addition, Republicans accused Hamilton of a backdoor effort to
reinstate the Clark Amendment, a 1976 amendment authored by former
Sen. Dick Clark (D-Iowa) that banned aid to the Angolan rebels. The
Clark Amendment was repealed by Congress last year.
But Hamilton, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee with
responsibility for overseeing covert activities, argued that his legislation
was intended only to force Reagan to recognize the prerogatives of
Congress in such matters. "The United States should support a war in
Angola only with the approval of Congress," he said.
The United States is known to have given at least $15 million in covert
aid to Savimbi in the current fiscal year, quietly funneling it through the
Central Intelligence Agency. Savimbi is fighting the Marxist government
of President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, which is backed by an estimated
35,000 Cuban troops.
Jet bomb unrelated to Libya attack
LONDON — Antiterrorist police investigating the attempted bomb
ing of an El A 1 jumbo jet here last Thursday are "100 percent satisfied"
that it was unrelated to a U.S. air attack against Libya two days before,
sources here said yesterday.
Investigators have determined that the El A 1 bombing was plotted
long before the raid on Libya. While they believe it was planned under
the auspices of a terrorist organization allied with at least one Middle
Eastern country, sources said police are not yet ready to say which or
ganization, or which country.
Libyan involvement has not been ruled out, nor has a role by Syria,
which supports a number of such organizations in the Middle East.
Much of the information police have gathered so far on the El A 1 plot
has come from Nezar Hindawi, a 31-year-old Palestinian of Jordanian
nationality who was arrested Friday. Tuesday, Hindawi was formally
charged with conspiring to murder the passengers aboard the Tel Aviv
bound jet. The jet was only a half hour from take-off at London's
Heathrow airport when a bomb he allegedly concealed in the luggage of
his girlfriend was discovered.
Botha seeks emergency powers
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — President Pieter Botha asked the
South African parliament here yesterday to approve legislation giving
the minister of law and order sweeping new powers, approaching martial
law authority, to deal with the country's continuing civil strife.
The draft legislation would permit the minister to declare any part of
the country an "unrest area." whether there had been rioting or just the
1 threat of it.and then to take whatever actions there he regards as neces
sary to restore order.
The effect of the legislation would be to allow the minister to declare a
"state of emergency," much like that imposed by Botha in large areas of
the country for more than sevefi months last year and this, but without
the high political cjost of doing so.
The minister, and under him the police commissioner and his
deputies, would, for example, be able as a result of the proposed legisla
tion to suspend civil rights, to detain people without charge or trial, to
impose curfews, to censor the press, to make searches without warrant,
to close businesses and seize property.
The minister would also be authorized to extend such regulations
outside the "unrest area" if he believed it would help restore order.
Opposition groups immediately objected both to the concentration of
so much power in the hands of Louis le Grange, the minister of law and
order, and the sweeping nature of that authority.
Botha's National Party has effective control of parliament, ensuring
passage of the legislation.
Since the state of emergency was lifted March 7, "black-on-black vio
lence has increased alarmingly," Botha said, noting that in recent weeks
about half of the unrest victims have been blacks killed by other blacks.
With a total of 171 reported deaths, March was the bloodiest month
since the unrest began in September 1984.
100 million malnourished in China
PEKING — The head of the United Nations' World Food Program
said yesterda., that there are still an estimated 100 million people in
China unable to feed orcloihe themselves.
"China's per capita consumption of cereals is one of the lowest in the
James Ingram, the program's executive director, told reporters
at the end of an official visit here. He said that "China's consumption of
dairy products is the lowest in the world of any significant country."
Ingram and other World Food Program officials said there was
evidence of anemia resulting from malnutrition in many areas of China.
However, they said. Chinese relief and food-distribution efforts have
been successful in preventing starvation.

has come from Nezar Hindawi, a 31-year-old Palestinian of Jordanian
nationality who was arrested Friday. Tuesday, Hindawi was formally
charged with conspiring to murder the passengers aboard the Tel Aviv
bound jet. The jet was only a half hour from take-off at London's
Heathrow airport when a bomb he allegedly concealed in the luggage of
his girlfriend was discovered.
Botha seeks emergency powers
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — President Pieter Botha asked the
South African parliament here yesterday to approve legislation giving
the minister of law and order sweeping new powers, approaching martial
law authority, to deal with the country's continuing civil strife.
The draft legislation would permit the minister to declare any part of
the country an "unrest area." whether there had been rioting or just the
1 threat of it.and then to take whatever actions there he regards as neces
sary to restore order.
The effect of the legislation would be to allow the minister to declare a
"state of emergency," much like that imposed by Botha in large areas of
the country for more than sevefi months last year and this, but without
the high political cjost of doing so.
The minister, and under him the police commissioner and his
deputies, would, for example, be able as a result of the proposed legisla
tion to suspend civil rights, to detain people without charge or trial, to
impose curfews, to censor the press, to make searches without warrant,
to close businesses and seize property.
The minister would also be authorized to extend such regulations
outside the "unrest area" if he believed it would help restore order.
Opposition groups immediately objected both to the concentration of
so much power in the hands of Louis le Grange, the minister of law and
order, and the sweeping nature of that authority.
Botha's National Party has effective control of parliament, ensuring
passage of the legislation.
Since the state of emergency was lifted March 7, "black-on-black vio
lence has increased alarmingly," Botha said, noting that in recent weeks
about half of the unrest victims have been blacks killed by other blacks.
With a total of 171 reported deaths, March was the bloodiest month
since the unrest began in September 1984.
100 million malnourished in China
PEKING — The head of the United Nations' World Food Program
said yesterda., that there are still an estimated 100 million people in
China unable to feed orcloihe themselves.
"China's per capita consumption of cereals is one of the lowest in the
James Ingram, the program's executive director, told reporters
at the end of an official visit here. He said that "China's consumption of
dairy products is the lowest in the world of any significant country."
Ingram and other World Food Program officials said there was
evidence of anemia resulting from malnutrition in many areas of China.
However, they said. Chinese relief and food-distribution efforts have
been successful in preventing starvation.
Reagan warns against terrorist acts
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yesterday he would use
military force against Iran or Syria if presented with clear evidence that
one of those governments had sponsored an act of terrorism against
Americans.
"State-supported terrorism is a form of warfare and you just can't sit
by and let somebody else declare war on you and pretend that you're at
peace," Reagan told a group of columnists and commentators in the
White House family theater when asked whether he was willing to use
force against Iran or Syria if they sponsored terrorist incidents.
The president said that in many instances it was difficult to obtain the
"irrefutable evidence" he claimed the United States had before its April
14 bombing raid on Libya. But he added that when such v evidence exists,
"we must have the same policy" in dealing with state-supported ter
rorism.
Reagan was then asked whether this meant using force against
Damascus or Tehran. He replied, "Yes, if we had that kind of evidence."
The president's comments came an hour after he issued a sweeping
call for political and economic freedom throughout the world in a speech
to an international forum of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
He combined this message with a stern warning to Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Khadafy that the United States is ready to strike again if
Libya sponsors further acts of terrorism. Reagan and other U.S. officials
have said that the April 14 attack was based on evidence of Libyan re
sponsibility for the bombing of a West Berlin night club in which a U.S.
soldier and a Turkish woman were killed and more than 200 persons
injured.
"By nature, we prefer to solve problems peacefully," Reagan said.
"But as we proved last week, no one can kill Americans and brag about
it. No one. We bear the people of Libya no ill will, but if their govern
ment continues its campaign of terror against Americans, we will act
again."
" Arab nations themselves have been forced to endure terrorist attacks
from this minority," Reagan said. "We hope and pray the Arab world
will join with us to eliminate this scourge on civilization."
House halts covert aid to Angola
WASHINGTON — The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted
yesterday to halt covert U.S. aid to the Angola rebels and require Presi
dent Reagan to seek the approval of Congress for any future assistance
to the resistances forces led by Jonas Savimbi.
vote of 22 to 18, the committee approved the bill authored by
Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) that supporters of the president portrayed
as an attack on the so-called Reagan doctrine of support for anti-
Communist "freedom fighters" around the globe.
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) described the committee vote as an exercise
in "Reagan bashing" by the Democrats and"the death knell for covert
activity" by the United States.
In addition, Republicans accused Hamilton of a backdoor effort to
reinstate the Clark Amendment, a 1976 amendment authored by former
Sen. Dick Clark (D-Iowa) that banned aid to the Angolan rebels. The
Clark Amendment was repealed by Congress last year.
But Hamilton, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee with
responsibility for overseeing covert activities, argued that his legislation
was intended only to force Reagan to recognize the prerogatives of
Congress in such matters. "The United States should support a war in
Angola only with the approval of Congress," he said.
The United States is known to have given at least $15 million in covert
aid to Savimbi in the current fiscal year, quietly funneling it through the
Central Intelligence Agency. Savimbi is fighting the Marxist government
of President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, which is backed by an estimated
35,000 Cuban troops.
Jet bomb unrelated to Libya attack
LONDON — Antiterrorist police investigating the attempted bomb
ing of an El A 1 jumbo jet here last Thursday are "100 percent satisfied"
that it was unrelated to a U.S. air attack against Libya two days before,
sources here said yesterday.
Investigators have determined that the El A 1 bombing was plotted
long before the raid on Libya. While they believe it was planned under
the auspices of a terrorist organization allied with at least one Middle
Eastern country, sources said police are not yet ready to say which or
ganization, or which country.
Libyan involvement has not been ruled out, nor has a role by Syria,
which supports a number of such organizations in the Middle East.
