# Senate restores Reagan cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate, in its first vote
on the fiscal 1987 budget, demonstrated its intent
to reject President Reagan's spending priorities by
overwhelmingly turning down his request to ter
minate more than 40 federal programs.
In another indication that the Republican-led
Senate plans to chart an independent course on the
budget, it also voted to restore education funds
previously cut under the Gramm-Rudman law.
Moreover, it opted to pay for the increase with
higher taxes — despite Reagan's warning that he
would veto a tax hike.
"It's a great start in the wrong direction," Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-
N.M.) said after the 60-38 vote to add back $1.2
billion in education funds, which would be enough
to compensate for earlier cuts and anticipated infla
tion of around 4 percent.
Today, Domenici said, the Senate will have "an
opportunity to break the bank," when it considers
an amendment to extend the federal revenue

sharing program beyond its scheduled expiration
when fiscal 1987 begins in October.
Debate on the budget is expected to extend into
next week.
A budget package produced last month by the
Senate Budget Committee faces uncertain
prospects in light of the strong criticism it has
received from the White House and many Senate
Republicans. Opposition centers on the commit
tee's proposal to sharply cut Reagan's defense re
quest and add about $ 12 billion in new taxes to the
relatively modest revenues that Reagan included in
the budget he submitted to Congress earlier this
year.
In the end, the Senate hopes to put together a
budget plan that would reduce the projected fiscal
1987 deficit by almost $40 billion. That would be
enough to avoid the painful automatic spending
cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law if
Congress fails to chop the deficit to $144 billion.
The 83-14 vote not to kill the programs Reagan

had marked for extinction was largely a symbolic
one, indicating that the Senate does not share the
president's view that defense spending should be
allowed to grow at the expense of popular social
programs.
Edwin Dale Jr., a spokesman for the White
House budget office, dismissed the vote as "a little
innocent game-playing.'" Sen. William Armstrong
(R-Colo.), one of those who supported Reagan,
called the vote "a sham. . . . People think
Congress is populated by some gutless wonders,
and I guess I'd have to agree."
However, Domenici pointed out that the govern
ment would save only $4 billion by terminating the
programs, which range from loans to stimulate ex
ports to sewer grants.
"Some federal programs are investments ... in
vesting in our todays and all of our nation's tomor
rows," said Sen. Mark Andrews (R-N.D.), who
sponsored the amendment.
