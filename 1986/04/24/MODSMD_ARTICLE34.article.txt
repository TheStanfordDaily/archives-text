# Libya orders journalists to leave
## 
### 
TRIPOLI, Libya â€” The Libyan
government, putting a new twist on
terrorist threats, claimed yesterday
that American and Israeli
provocateurs are planning to carry
out violent but covert terrorist opera
tions in Europe to discredit the
regime of Libyan leader Col. Moam
mar Khadafy and give Washington a
pretext for further retaliatory attacks
here.
A statement read to reporters by
Information Minister Sharif Eddeen
said that intelligence on this alleged
plot had been gained by Libyan and
"other sources." 1 But there was no
way of telling if the announcement
was propaganda, intelligence or a
smokescreen for operations the
Libyans may themselves be planning.
In a long day of confused and con
tradictory signals from the Libyan
government, this stood out as the
most ominous.
Earlier in the day, in another
curious move, Libyan officials in
formed the approximately 300
foreign journalists who have arrived
here in the last 10 days that they are
expected to leave immediately.

But after two busloads carrying
about 100 journalists departed for
the airport, the remaining reporters,
camera crews and photographers
were told they could remain here un
til tomorrow. Representatives of all
the U.S. networks and most major
newspapers have stayed.
Diplomats who could be contacted
yesterday, meanwhile, tended to dis
miss as considerable overstatement a
London Times report yesterday sug
gesting that Khadafy has effectively
relinquished sole military and politcal
power in the aftermath of the U.S.
bombing raid to a five-man junta of
which he is only one member.
The supposed members of the
junta are, in fact, the same men who
have been at the pinnacle of power
around Khadafy since the overthrow
of the monarchy here in 1969.
Known as the Revolutionary Council,
those who remain prominent are, in
addition to Khadafy himself, his No.
2 man Abdel Salim Jalloud, Defense
Minister Abu Bakr Yunis and Khuildi
Hamedi, who spoke Friday at the
mass funeral for victims of the bomb
ing

At a press conference last week,
Jalloud made a point of saying that
the members of the Revolutionary
Council and subordinate groups like
the Revolutionary Committee in ef
fect "are Khadafy."
One of the most experienced non
aligned diplomats in Tripoli said yes
terday he believes that since the
American bombing the Libyan leader
"is not weaker, but he's more cleverly
organized."
Speaking of the Revolutionary
Council's members, the diplomat
said, "They are more equal than they
used to be before, but he (Khadafy) is
still No. 1."
In effect, according to this analysis,
responsibility in what was heretofore
a government deliberately founded
on anarchical principles is now being
more deliberately delegated by
Khadafy to his subordinates.
"The pyramid of power was built
very delicately," this diplomat said.
Now it is stronger, he suggested.
At the same time, the Soviet profile
that appeared remarkably low in the
days before the bombing is once
again looming high.

Tuesday, a Soviet navy frigate bris
tling with antennas and guns docked
in Tripoli harbor. Libyan television
announced last night that a group of
Soviet naval technicians is visiting
here.
Tuesday night Libyan television
showed for the first time what may be
a piece of the U.S. Air Force F-l 11
jet that crashed during the raid last
week. A metal structure about five
feet long that appeared to be part of a
wing or tail section was shown awash
in the surf at a Libyan beach.
What appeared to be the same
piece, painted military green with a
wide red stripe on its edge, was shown
on television again last night. Several
apparent bullet holes were pointed
out by a commentator.
The coincidence of the arrival of
the Soviet ship and technicians to
gether with the exhibition of the film
showing the piece of wreckage sug
gested to some European analysts
here that the Soviet ship may in fact
have come to Tripoli to recover some
of the plane from the ocean for intel
ligence purposes.
