Court hears budget law
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion, engaged in a far-reaching constitutional
conflict with Congress, urged the Supreme Court
yesterday to strike down the automatic deficit
reduction provisions of the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law.
In oral argument. Solicitor General Charles
Fried told the justices that the landmark law vio
lated the separation of powers by giving an offi
cer of Congress (the comptroller-general)
budget-cutting authority that should be reserved
to the executive branch.
"Here we have an officer Che comptroller)
who gives orders to the president," Fried said.
"These powers are entirely novel .... This grant
of authority violates the Constitution."
On the other side, lawyers for the comptroller,
the Senate and the House leadership all defended
the constitutionality of the law and the key role
of the comptroller in the budget-reduction
process.
Under review is a decision by a special three
judge federal couit in February that invalidated
the law's deficit-reduction mechanism on the
grounds that it violated the separation of powers.
Despite its technical nature, the case will have
an immediate practical effect on efforts to trim
the nations growing budget deficit, now about
$208 billion. It could also could alter the tradi

tional balance of power between the president
and Congress. A decision by the justices is ex
pected by July.
House takes back raise
WASHINGTON — House members got cold
feet yesterday and rescinded a lucrative but
politically embarrassing increase in outside ear
ning power that they approved for themselves at
breakneck legislative speed only the day before.
Ignoring charges that they lacked the "guts" to
vote themselves a needed raise, lawmakers voted
333 to 68 to revoke a controversial rules change
that would have let them keep at least an addi
tional $7,510 a year in pay from private sources
for making speeches, writing articles and per
forming other tasks.
If it had survived, the change would have
raised the self-imposed ceiling on honoraria that
House members are allowed to accept from 30
percent to 40 percent of their $75,100 annual
pay — matching a similar increase that senators
approved for themselves last year.
However, staff analysts in the House said the
measure was defectively written and would have
eliminated all present restrictions on the amount
of money legislators can pocket from profes
sional fees and salaries from other jobs.

City sends contras guns
HI ALE AH, Fla. — This city — known for its
race track, low-rent apartments and a pretty
good flea market — has done what Congress
would not. It has voted to send guns to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
Not a great arsenal, of course. Just some Uzis,
shotguns, sporting rifles and maybe a few
hundred handguns — whatever extras the police
have lying around.
"If every city in the state chipped in. we could
ship them 100,000 weapons easy," said council
man Julio Martinez.
Prices close lower again

midsession lows, however.

down about 20 points at one stage, finished with
a 1.37 loss at 1,829.61. The average took a

slowed to 149.69 million shares from 161.51 mil
lion Tuesday.
