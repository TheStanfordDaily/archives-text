Walker passed lie test
SAN FRANCISCO — Confessed spymaster
John Walker passed a recent lie-detector test at
which he said he had paid espionage defendant
Jerry Whitworth in exchange for classified ma
terial, the prosecution in Whitworth's trial said
yesterday.
The U.S. Attorney's office said Walker was
given the test after U.S. District Judge John
Vukasin tentatively ruled last week that the jury
in Whitworth's trial could he told that Walker
had flunked a lie-detector test last year.
Whitworth. a 46-year-old retired Navy
radioman from Davis, is charged with selling
secrets about Navy code and communications
systems for $332,000 to a Soviet-controlled spy
ring led by Walker, his longtime friend.
Walker, who has pleaded guilty to espionage,
is scheduled to testify for the prosecution next
Monday when Whitworth's trial resumes after a
one-week recess.
According to papers newly filed by the prose
cution. the same polygraph examiner who tested
Walker last year gave him the new test and found
that he was not being deceptive in answering
questions about Whitworth.
Walker said during the recent test that he had
told the FBI that Whitworth had given him classi

fied material and that he had given Whitworth
money in exchange, and that he was not lying in
those statements, the prosecution said.
In the earlier lie-detector test last July, the ex
aminer found that Walker was probably being
deceptive when he denied that he was withhold
ing the names of people who had given him secret
information or helped him deliver secrets to the
Soviets. He was not asked directly about Whit
worth.
In papers filed yesterday, the prosecution said
it still opposes admission into evidence of any lie
detector results.
UCLA protest violent
LOS ANGELES — An anti-apartheid demon
stration at UCLA that turned violent yesterday
afternoon prompted the arrests of 24 demonstra
tors and resulted in injuries to three campus
policemen, a university spokesman said.
Demonstrators threw trash cans, picnic tables
and construction materials at officers who ar
rested two dozen activists occupying the campus
career placement center, said Mike McManus.
UCLA's vice chancellor for public information.
The demonstrators were demanding the uni

versity divest itself from businesses tied to ra
cially segregated South Africa, hut, in a tele
phone interview, McManus said many of those
arrested did not appear to be university students.
"You look at the crowd, and they are wearing
baggy Levis, fatigue jackets and pink hair and
you know they aren't UCLA students," said
McManus, who witnessed the demonstration.
"They basically threw everything that wasn't
nailed down."
The protest turned violent after a peaceful
noontime rally to commemorate the anniversary
of a demonstration held last year to signal stu
dent anger over South Africa's policy of segrega
tion known as apartheid.
"There is time to negotiate and there is time to
agitate. I think the time to negotiate has passed,"
Dion Raymond, a protest leader.
"The time for divestment is long overdue. It is
wrong," said junior Anthony Myers, who joined
in the demonstration.
