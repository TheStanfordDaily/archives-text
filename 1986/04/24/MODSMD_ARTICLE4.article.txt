### FELICIA PAIK Staff writer 
The Black Student Union yesterday took its fight for a
world culture program to the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies.
In a letter to the committee, the BSU renewed its call
for the University to replace current Western Culture
tracks with ones that include the historical and philosophi
cal contributions of women and minorities.
"We, the members of the black community, have found
the current Western Culture program to be a disservice to
the Stanford community because of its failure to acknowl
edge the contributions and impact of women and people
of color on American and European culture, " the letter
said.
For the incoming class of 1990, the BSU is proposing an

American culture track which would emphasize "the con
tributions of cultures disregarded and/or distorted by the
present program."
After this initial change, the BSU would like to replace
the Western Culture program with a world studies pro
gram encompassing Africa, Europe, Asia and the
Americas.
The BSU's letter was endorsed by groups and individ
uals from sectors of the black community including fac
ulty, staff, pre-professional organizations, Greek organi
zations and graduate student groups.
"We are under no illusions that the black community
alone will able to implement a new program on its own.
We will be calling on members of the Asian-American,
Native American and Chicano communities for support,"
said Amanda Kemp, secretary of the BSU.
The committee will consider the BSU's proposal as it

coincides with its own discussion for change in the West
ern Culture program, said Classics Prof. Marsh McCall,
chairman of C-US.
The BSU hopes to establish a task force of faculty and
students to discuss an alternative to the Western Culture
program, one which will present the United States as a
part of the global society.
University President Donald Kennedy has met with the
officers of the BSU and cleared the way for the BSU's
meeting with C-US yesterday, according to Bob Hamrdla,
assistant to the president.
"President Kennedy may well support these changes for
the Western Culture program, but he has not been pre
sented a formal, written proposal at this time," said
Hamrdla.
Along with McCall, C-US is comprised of six faculty
members and three students.
