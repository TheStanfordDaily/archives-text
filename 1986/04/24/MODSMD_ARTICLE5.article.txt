# Alpha Delts dispute drug-sale charges
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
The Alpha Delta Phi fraternity yester
day delivered a report to the Office of Res
idential Education disputing charges that
could lead the University to revoke its
recogniton of the Alpha Delts.
Row Director Diana Conklin said that if
"substantive" changes are not made in the
fraternity, the University would be forced
to deny housing to the Alpha Delts.
However, it will "be a while" before the
University reaches a final decision on the
fate of the fraternity, she said.

The University is especially concerned
with the "dangerous environment" of the
Alpha Delts. according to Conklin. In a
March 5 letter to the fraternity, Conklin
wrote that the number and severity of
"personal and academic crises" among fra
ternity members disturbed the University.
Reports of drug sales by members of the
house as well as the Alpha Delts' inability
to fill their quota of residents contributed
to the University's concern, Conklin said.
For three out of the last four years, the Al
pha Delts have missed meeting their quota
of residents by a wide margin, she said.
Although not filling house quotas could

serve as a basis for opening the fraternity
to the Draw, Conklin said that action was
not taken due to the "deeper concerns" of
the University.
According to Conklin, the problems
with the Alpha Delts have persisted for the
last five years and that the "time had
come" for the University to decide if the
Alpha Delts should continue to be housed
or recognized by the University.
Alpha Delt President Mike McAulay
blamed the fraternity's inability to meet its
quota and the personal and academic
problems of some fraternity members on

the period of transition he said the frater
nity has been going through in the last few
years. However, he said, "The house is
getting healthier and healthier." He added
that he felt the fraternity would be able to
fill its quota of residents this year.
McAulay added that the allegation of
drug dealing in the house is "completely
inaccurate. There is no drug selling at this
house at all."
The Alpha Delts' case is "very strong,"
McAulay said. "I like to think the purpose
of the letter is to force us to make changes
and not to disband us and kick us off
campus."
