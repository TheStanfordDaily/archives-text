# Adams votes for hum bio focus

### VIVIAN ROGERS 
Adams House residents last
night voted in favor of establishing
a human biology focus program at
their house next year.
The program will have a core
group of eight students who will
plan activities and will consist of
lectures, access to human biology
faculty and "more resources to
give support for involved students
and their projects," according to
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
Residential Education.
"The program, however, will
not limit any other types of activi
ties which the students want,"
Supton said.
Some residents were concerned
that the program would only bene
fit a few members in Adams and
cut into time for activities to inter
est more than a small group.
However, other students ex
plained that the program will be
mainly supervised by the resident
fellows Gene and Paul Flood, and
any activity will have to meet both
their and the majority of the resi

dents' approval.
Adams residents were informed
of the proposal last month by
fliers announcing a meeting to
discuss the proposal that night.
Residents' initial reaction was
anger, according to Kathleen
Stewart, residential assistant at
Adams. "People were mad be
cause they had the whole thing
dumped on them with barely any
time to think about it," she said.
Opinions have changed after a
meeting last Monday to better ex
plain the proposal, Adams resi
dents said. Heller explained to res
idents in attendence that human
biology is a very broad major and
could interest students in many
departments.
"It's a good way to encourage
and support students," Supton
said.
Stewart and the other two RAs
at Adams agreed and said the
focus house program is only an ex
periment for the next academic
year. "It doesn't have to be at
Adams the year after next,"
Stewart said.
