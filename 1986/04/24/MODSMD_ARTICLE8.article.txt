# Students oppose Davies decision
## 
### KRISTEN BROWN Staff writer 
Leaders of a student group met with Provost
James Rosse Monday to present an argument
against the January 15 History Department deci
sion to deny a professorship to visiting Prof. Nor
man Davies.
The department's refusal to appoint Davies to a
now vacant professorship in East European studies
has angered members of the Stanford and Bay
Area communities who say Davies is one of the
world's leading experts on Polish affairs.
Senior Chris Deßosa, leader of the group, told
the provost that if the decision was in fact based on
scholarhip and teaching, the department made an
outright mistake.
Rosse responded: " I should tell you up front that
I'm continuing my inquiry in what's going on here.
It's quite clear that this was a close and difficult
decision and I don't think I can say anything more
about it at this time."
Deßosa mentioned a conversation he had with a
member of search committee who had headed the
search committee in order to fill the vacancy. The
committee member had "heard rumors that Davies
was not appointed because of reasons outside the
topics of scholarship and teaching," Deßosa said.
The rumors were that a particular chapter in one
of Davies' book, "Gods' Playground" is anti-
Semitic: that the women in the department did not
like the idea of Davies being hired: and that
younger, non-tenured professors did not like the

idea of hiring him. Deßosasaid.
Rosse said that he has requested a complete dos
sier of materials used by the department for its
decision. "In the meantime, a person on my staff is
putting together a document that summarizes the
considerations taken into account when Davies was
being considered."
Four weeks ago. Davies wrote a letter to the
provost requesting that he be informed about the
reasons for his denial.
Rosse said that as soon as he read the letter, he
set the dossier process in motion, and that he felt
badly that so much time will have elapsed before
Davies receives an explanation.
The written explantion should be ready for
Davies at the end of this week, Rosse said.
Rosse explained that Davies had been the victim
of "a gap in our rules that he fell into."
The Faculty Handbook says that regular faculty
members denied promotion "shall first be notified
of the charges and given an opportunity to reply,
and to file a grievance."
But, since Davies is not a regular faculty mem
ber, he technically does not have the right to take
advantage of the grievance policy or to be given a
written explanation of the decision.
Consequently, he never received a dossier.
"A case like this rarely arises, and when it did
arise, we blew it," said Rosse. "If he wants to file a
grievance, I will of course honor that and the means
by which it can be resolved."
If Davies does decide to file a grievance against

the department's decision, it will first go to the
School of Humanities and Sciences. If the school
honors the appeal, the decision will be overturned;
if not, Davies can appeal the grievance to the
provost and again to the Advisory Board, the presi
dent and, finally, to the Board of Trustees.
In a KZSU interview March 10, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy implied that if grievances
regarding non-appointments are not honored in the
lower administration levels, he is unlikely to over
turn them.
"If we lived in a world in which the president and
the provost could reach down and change those
results at will, it would be a world that most people
in the department wouldn't like, and one that I
wouldn't like either,'' he said.
"On the other side of the coin," Rosse said,
"once a department starts going in a certain direc
tion, it tends to choose someone it understands.
Like chooses like."
According to the student group, their "primary
concern is that the History Department is becom
ing increasingly small-minded."
Czestaw Milotz, 1981 Nobel Prize winner for
literature and a professor at UC-Berkeley, told The
Daily six weeks ago that news of Davies' non
appointment did not surprise him.
"In view of the skeptism in the interest of Stan
ford in my part of Europe, I would not be
surprised." he said. "Those universities which, like
Stanford, do not take interest in my part of Europe,
by which I mean central Europe between Germany
and Russia, are wrong: they harm themselves."

The written explantion should be ready for
Davies at the end of this week, Rosse said.
Rosse explained that Davies had been the victim
of "a gap in our rules that he fell into."
The Faculty Handbook says that regular faculty
members denied promotion "shall first be notified
of the charges and given an opportunity to reply,
and to file a grievance."
But, since Davies is not a regular faculty mem
ber, he technically does not have the right to take
advantage of the grievance policy or to be given a
written explanation of the decision.
Consequently, he never received a dossier.
"A case like this rarely arises, and when it did
arise, we blew it," said Rosse. "If he wants to file a
grievance, I will of course honor that and the means
by which it can be resolved."
If Davies does decide to file a grievance against

the department's decision, it will first go to the
School of Humanities and Sciences. If the school
honors the appeal, the decision will be overturned;
if not, Davies can appeal the grievance to the
provost and again to the Advisory Board, the presi
dent and, finally, to the Board of Trustees.
In a KZSU interview March 10, University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy implied that if grievances
regarding non-appointments are not honored in the
lower administration levels, he is unlikely to over
turn them.
"If we lived in a world in which the president and
the provost could reach down and change those
results at will, it would be a world that most people
in the department wouldn't like, and one that I
wouldn't like either,'' he said.
"On the other side of the coin," Rosse said,
"once a department starts going in a certain direc
tion, it tends to choose someone it understands.
Like chooses like."
According to the student group, their "primary
concern is that the History Department is becom
ing increasingly small-minded."
Czestaw Milotz, 1981 Nobel Prize winner for
literature and a professor at UC-Berkeley, told The
Daily six weeks ago that news of Davies' non
appointment did not surprise him.
"In view of the skeptism in the interest of Stan
ford in my part of Europe, I would not be
surprised." he said. "Those universities which, like
Stanford, do not take interest in my part of Europe,
by which I mean central Europe between Germany
and Russia, are wrong: they harm themselves."
