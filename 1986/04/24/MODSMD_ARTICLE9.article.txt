# Overseas students share terrorism worries
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN 
Two students studying at Stanford
overseas campuses returned to the
United States, and others are cancel
ing travel plans because of
heightened concern about terrorism
in Europe. But most say that they do
not feel threatened.
Junior Kelli Wong left Florence be
cause she was really worried," ac
cording to Scott Bekemeyer. also a
junior studying in Florence.
Bekemeyer said he will not be leaving
because 'there's nothing to worry
about."
According to Karen Kramer, direc
tor of Stanford-in-Berlin, junior Tom
Gregory left Berlin "regretfully" in
the wake of last week's U.S. military
retaliation against Libya for the ter
rorist bombing of a Berlin disco.
He didn't believe he was in any
danger, but he felt that his parents
would worry too much if he remained
overseas, she said. Gregory was un
availiable for comment.

Three Stanford students were in a
theater near the La Belle Disco at the
time of the explosion. John Chosy,
Andy Hall and James Stuebner, all
juniors studying at Stanford's Oxford
center, were in Berlin on the last stop
of their spring break trip through
Europe.
"We didn't know anything had
happened until we came out of the
theater and saw a lot of military
police and fire trucks," said Chosy.
"We were a little concerned about
the return flight the next day, but se
curity seemed tight," Chosy said. He
added that they did not feel as though
they were in much danger and that
"there is no sense of fear on the Ox
ford campus."
The Oxford center has hired a
night guard to periodically inspect the
building which houses students there.
"We simply did it out of prudence,"
said Geoffrey Tyack, director of
Stanford-in-Oxford. "We do not feel
threatened, but I believe the students
will feel more secure now."

At the Berlin center, "no one
senses that there is any immediate
danger," said Kramer. "It was very
tense for a time right after the bomb
ing, but everyone has calmed down.
We share a wall with the commanding
general of Berlin and feel very secure
because he is well-guarded."
The State Department gave
Kramer a list of bars, restaurants and
discos which Americans should avoid.
Kramer noted "none of them are
places that our students would go to
anyway; they are places American
servicemen hang out, and our stu
dents want to meet Germans."
Kramer asked students to use com
mon sense to increase their safety:
avoid "broadcasting" their citizen
ship, lock doors and report suspicious
activity.
Directors at other campuses have
done the same, according to Padgett,
who opened a Tuesday meeting in
Cubberley for those who will be going
overseas next year with warnings
about terrorism.

Giuseppe Mammarella, director of
Stanford-in-Florence, told The Daily
that he met with the U.S. consul in
Florence who made "informal sug
gestions" that students avoid places
Americans go and avoid "acting obvi
ously American."
The State Department has issued
no advisories with special respect to
students, said Deborah Cavin, State
Department press officer.
"All Americans should exercise
prudence when travelling abroad in
accordance with Secretary (George)
Shultz's recommendation. This
means not travelling in large groups,
leaving itineraries behind so others
know your whereabouts, and avoid
ing establishments frequented by
Americans," she said.
Micheal Schenkman, a junior in
Florence, said that he and four others
were "acting like obnoxious
Americans and drinking" in Rome
over the weekend, but calmed down
when they saw "a lot of policemen
with machine guns clearing a

McDonald's where there was a bomb
threat."
"Most students don't want to go
further south than Rome, and a lot of
people have talked about going
home. There are tanks patrolling
Florence and the director met with
policemen in the villa on Monday,"
he said.
There is particular concern in
Florence "because of our proximity
to Libya," he said. "But everyone
feels pretty safe."
Schenkman said that there has
been an increase in communist party
demonstrations in Italy since the
American attack, sayipg anti-
American themes are often seized
upon. "But the Europeans don't hate
Americans," he said.
The Overseas Studies Office has
made no changes in its plans for next
year and is "not making any cut
backs," Padgett said, "but we will be
directly discussing the issue of
safety."

junior studying in Florence.
Bekemeyer said he will not be leaving
because 'there's nothing to worry
about."
According to Karen Kramer, direc
tor of Stanford-in-Berlin, junior Tom
Gregory left Berlin "regretfully" in
the wake of last week's U.S. military
retaliation against Libya for the ter
rorist bombing of a Berlin disco.
He didn't believe he was in any
danger, but he felt that his parents
would worry too much if he remained
overseas, she said. Gregory was un
availiable for comment.

Three Stanford students were in a
theater near the La Belle Disco at the
time of the explosion. John Chosy,
Andy Hall and James Stuebner, all
juniors studying at Stanford's Oxford
center, were in Berlin on the last stop
of their spring break trip through
Europe.
"We didn't know anything had
happened until we came out of the
theater and saw a lot of military
police and fire trucks," said Chosy.
"We were a little concerned about
the return flight the next day, but se
curity seemed tight," Chosy said. He
added that they did not feel as though
they were in much danger and that
"there is no sense of fear on the Ox
ford campus."
The Oxford center has hired a
night guard to periodically inspect the
building which houses students there.
"We simply did it out of prudence,"
said Geoffrey Tyack, director of
Stanford-in-Oxford. "We do not feel
threatened, but I believe the students
will feel more secure now."

At the Berlin center, "no one
senses that there is any immediate
danger," said Kramer. "It was very
tense for a time right after the bomb
ing, but everyone has calmed down.
We share a wall with the commanding
general of Berlin and feel very secure
because he is well-guarded."
The State Department gave
Kramer a list of bars, restaurants and
discos which Americans should avoid.
Kramer noted "none of them are
places that our students would go to
anyway; they are places American
servicemen hang out, and our stu
dents want to meet Germans."
Kramer asked students to use com
mon sense to increase their safety:
avoid "broadcasting" their citizen
ship, lock doors and report suspicious
activity.
Directors at other campuses have
done the same, according to Padgett,
who opened a Tuesday meeting in
Cubberley for those who will be going
overseas next year with warnings
about terrorism.

Giuseppe Mammarella, director of
Stanford-in-Florence, told The Daily
that he met with the U.S. consul in
Florence who made "informal sug
gestions" that students avoid places
Americans go and avoid "acting obvi
ously American."
The State Department has issued
no advisories with special respect to
students, said Deborah Cavin, State
Department press officer.
"All Americans should exercise
prudence when travelling abroad in
accordance with Secretary (George)
Shultz's recommendation. This
means not travelling in large groups,
leaving itineraries behind so others
know your whereabouts, and avoid
ing establishments frequented by
Americans," she said.
Micheal Schenkman, a junior in
Florence, said that he and four others
were "acting like obnoxious
Americans and drinking" in Rome
over the weekend, but calmed down
when they saw "a lot of policemen
with machine guns clearing a

McDonald's where there was a bomb
threat."
"Most students don't want to go
further south than Rome, and a lot of
people have talked about going
home. There are tanks patrolling
Florence and the director met with
policemen in the villa on Monday,"
he said.
There is particular concern in
Florence "because of our proximity
to Libya," he said. "But everyone
feels pretty safe."
Schenkman said that there has
been an increase in communist party
demonstrations in Italy since the
American attack, sayipg anti-
American themes are often seized
upon. "But the Europeans don't hate
Americans," he said.
The Overseas Studies Office has
made no changes in its plans for next
year and is "not making any cut
backs," Padgett said, "but we will be
directly discussing the issue of
safety."
