# New program offers funds for medical research abroad

Stanford medical students interested in research op
portunities outside the United States can now apply
under a new program for scholarships to underwrite
their study and travel expenses, according to Dr. John
Steward, associate dean of Student Affairs.
The Peter Emge Traveling Scholars program will
grant to student researchers tuition credit, research as
sistantship salary for one quarter and travel expenses
to and from the site of study. Steward said that six stu
dents are expected to be funded annually.
The current endowment has been created to provide
approximately $36,000 a year to fund the program.
"This program will give students the opportunity to
view medicine in an entirely different context from the
Western tertiary care institution that Stanford
represents," said Dr. Gary Schoolnik, chief of the
Stanford Medical Center's division of geographic
medicine.
"Here, students see mostly intervention in estab
lished illness. In developing countries, public health
practices and preventive medicine have a far more sig
nificant impact," Schoolnik said.
Dr. Paul Bash, professor of international health in
the department of family, community and preventive
medicine said, "It is part of our educational obligation
to make research abroad available to students who
would benefit.
"For this reason, the Emge scholarship is a really

unique resource. I am not aware of any other medical
school that has this type of program," he added.
Bash was quick to stress that this program is not
merely an easy way to circumvent requirements, but
will be as rigorous as other research programs.
Stanford medical students are required to complete
a research project before they graduate.
Rules for participating in the Emge program are
similar to rules for participating in the Medical School
Scholars Program, which administers the Emge pro
gram.
Scholars participating must identify a research pro
gram, submit a formal proposal and secure faculty
sponsorship in order to receive academic credit. After
finishing their projects, participants must present their
findings in a report suitable for publication in the
medical press.
The Emge program is expected to help students
pursue research opportunities in a wide variety of loca
tions. For example, Schoolnik said his division is in the
planning stages of establishing medical study programs
in Chiapas, Mexico, and Shanghai, China, and both
would be potential sites for Emge scholars.
However, according to Bash, scholars will not be
limited to outposts established by the University. In
fact, they will have the freedom to go to whatever geo
graphical region is most appropriate for their research.
The Emge fund commemorates the only son of Dr.
Ludwig Emge, a German-born physician who served
as chairman of the medical school's department of
obstetrics and gynecology from 1931-1949. Peter
Emge, a navy fighter pilot, died in an accident in 1945.
