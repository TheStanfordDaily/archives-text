## THE STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Amend Western Culture
### 
The Western Culture program at Stanford is in need
of reform, but not the kind of dramatic restructuring
proposed Wednesday by the Black Student Union.
In a letter to the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, the BSU blasted the Western Culture pro
gram's "failure to acknowledge the contributions and
impact of women and people of color on American and
European culture" and asked that it "be replaced with
a program focusing on the diverse nature of today's so
ciety, emphasizing Africa, Europe, Asia and the
Americas."
The motivation for the proposal is understandable.
As it now stands, the study of Western Culture is
largely the study of the history, literature and
philosophical thought of Caucasian males. Those Stan
ford freshmen who are not Caucasian males must
spend the greater part of three quarters wondering
where the women and minorities were for 2,000 years.
The BSU's solution is to ditch Western Culture in fa
vor of a world culture program, one that will represent
the contributions of both sexes and every kind of cul
ture throughout history. It's a noble idea, but it just
isn't feasible.
A one-year survey of the writings and events that
have made the greatest contributions to the history of
European and American culture is in itself an awesome
challenge. Western Culture professors complain con
tinuously that three quarters is not enough time for
them to adequately cover the material. The BSU's pro
posal — broadening the area of study to include all
cultures — would make this problem infinitely worse.
World culture is much too general a field to ap
prehend in three quarters. It may be politically fair to
give all cultures an equal representation, but a more

superficial coverage of such vital material is not fair
educationally.
Who gets cut — Plato or Aristotle? Descartes or
Rousseau? Austen or Woolf? How many Native
American authors will be included? How many Asian
writers? Who decides the "fair" balance of cultures in
the program?
The BSUs proposal is comparable to retracting a
microscope to pan an entire specimen on a slide: the
viewer sees everything, but it's somewhat fuzzy. He
loses the focus, the fascinating detail that prompted
him to turn on the microscope in the first place.
We want to keep that focus, because we think a clear
perspective on the events and thoughts that have
shaped our common culture is an immensely valuable
thing. But we agree that the Western Culture program
must increase its efforts to include the relevant contri
butions of women and minorities.
For the first two quarters of the track, when there
are very few extant authors who are not white males,
lecturers and section leaders should offer continuous
discussions on the role of women and minorities in an
cient history and literature. In the third-quarter course
on modern society, when there Is an explosion of con
tributions from women and minorities, the Western
Culture program should represent them accordingly on
the reading lists.
Stanford's Western Culture program must be altered
to include the long-neglected role of women and
minorities in the development of our culture. The BSU
proposal for a world culture program, however, is dan
gerously broad and would be extremely difficult to
implement. The present Western Culture program
needs to be changed, but not scrapped.
