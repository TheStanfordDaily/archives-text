## Attack was our best option 
### 
It's awfully easy, almost two weeks after the bombing of
Libya, to sit back and say — as did The Daily editorial
(April 21) and columnist Darieck Scott (The Daily, April
21) — "It was a mistake." But what is the evidence for
this judgement? Surely no one can seriously suggest that
the journalists killed in Beirut — who had been held as
hostages for some time before that — would have been
spared indefinitely otherwise. The kinds of actions being
taken "in.reprisal" for the bombing— that is, the shoot
ing of American diplomats, the attempted bombings of
airplanes — are exactly the same kind of actions carried
out practically weekly for the last three years, long before
the bombing was even conceived.

If the actions were truly a direct reaction to the
Americans, why would there be a bomb attempt on an El
Al airlire? By that reasoning, there should have been an
other attempt on TWA or American. An El Al airplane
was attacked for the same reason the terrorists have al
ways attacked El Al: the bombing of Libya has nothing to
do with it. Is every new terrorist action to be considered a
"reprisal" and thus somehow our own responsibility?
Let's place blame where it is due. The people who were
killed at the Rome and Vienna airports, the people shot
on the Achille Lauro, the people injured at the bombing
of the West Berlin disco — they did not die as a result of
any "reprisals." It's a mistake to blame ourselves for the
atrocities carried out by terrorists — they are not playing
by the same "rules" we are.
Most disturbing is the way in which The Daily and Scott
criticize without suggesting an alternate plan of action —
both say, in short, "we haven't solved the problem." No
problem of any magnitude can ever be solved overnight.
Only time — and that means more than one week — will
tell whether or not we have made a start at finding a solu
tion. Scott's column supports the bombing rather than

denigrates it — although that was clearly not his intent —
mostly because he lists every reason for the necessity of
the action and then can only list public opinion, as evinced
by the facial expressions of Stanford students around a
television set listening to the news, as a drawback. He
describes them as "slightly confused" — well, how many
Stanford students have been carefully following Khadafy's
"state of the people" and support of terrorism for the last
five years? I would be willing to bet not all of those
around the TV set. "Slightly confused" is not the best po
sition from which to make judgments on the value of gov
ernment action.
Scott suggests that a failure of Americans to jump for
joy at the idea of a bombing is a sound reason for declar
ing the bombing unsound. Why should Scott expect
anyone to be happy at the idea of military action, no mat
ter how just? My quarrel with Khadafy doesn't necessarily
mean I should be happy that his child is dead, or that any
bombs had to be dropped.
It is also important to realize that we did not attack
Libya solely to defend our "national pride" — we did it to
defend the lives of our citizens who live and travel over
seas. They are the ones on the front line, as the relatives of
those murdered in "isolated incidents" could tell you.
This is a new kind of war, but it had been declared long
before the bombing. It's true that the bombing won't solve
anything overnight, and that was never its stated goal. But
with the alternative of taking no action — without the
support of our allies on peaceful sanctions — there was ef
fectively no alternative.
Perhaps the real purpose of the bombing will be to con
vince our allies that they must act, or we will — and
already France has expelled Libyan travelers and
tightened up securities. Perhaps now sanctions will be
made when necessary, against countries supporting ter
rorism — sanctions previously considered by the
Europeans as "beating the air with a stick" — and this
kind of military strike will not need to be repeated.
