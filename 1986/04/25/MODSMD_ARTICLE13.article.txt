# College is time of greatest incompetence
## 
### 
Incompetence: we try to rid our efforts of it, we
don't want to be accused of it, we dread coming
into contact with it.
Indeed, we should dd all that we can to banish in
competence from our endeavors. Businesses lose
money due to incompetence, newpapers lose
readers, stores lose customers. One thing is clear:
incompetence equates with losing. The damage
that equation implies is made worse by the effi
ciency of incompetence. A little incompetence can

go a long way. One cable connected improperly can
cause the brakes to fail and the car to crash. Ten
words carelessly edited out at a crucial point can
dramatically alter the meaning of the text.
Because incompetence is frowned upon in this
country, few of us would readily admit to a charge
of incompetence, even if it were true. To be consid
ered incompetent in our task or responsibility is to
be viewed, to a certain extent, as incompetent in
general.
The American tendency toward non
responsibility nowhere becomes more apparent
than when defending against the possibility of in
competence. "That can't be done" usually means
"I don't know how to do it." "There was a mistake
made'' translates into "I fouled up." "Sorry I had
to do that" means "I know that I'm a bumbling
fool, please forgive me." Such are the ways in
which incompetence is shielded and deflected from
the person to whom it rightfully belongs.

Coming in contact with incompetence surely
stretches one's patience, as well as nurturing
frustration coupled with anger. It makes your job
harder than usual and less rewarding than your ef
fort dictates that it should be.
I remember as a freshman, a wise senior in my
dorm expressed great disdain at my suggestion that
he work with the magazine he had interned with
during the previous two summers.
"Why not?" I asked him. "It's a prestigious, very
successful magazine. Most people your age would
probably jump at a chance to work at such a
publication."
"It's not that simple," he replied. "Sure, it's a
well-known publication, but there are a lot of
stupid, incompetent people working there. If I
worked there. I'd have to follow the instructions of
some buffoon, who's much less intelligent than I
am."
"That's a pretty conceited attitude," I thought to
myself. I wondered if my soon-to-graduate friend
was as intelligent as he obviously thought himself to
be.
Over the next few months I noticed the organiza
tion and competence of this guy. Things were not
always done in the most efficient manner, but all in
all. he took care of business. He understood his re
sponsibilities and lived up to them consistently.
After getting to know him better, I could see why
he said what he said, and how, in a sense, he was
justified in saying it. He didn't want to place him
self in a job that would require him to deal with in
competent people all day long.
I still wonder whether the incompetence at that
company is the exception or the rule in American
society. Could that senior have realistically hoped
to find a company where he wouldn't have to take
orders from some clown who knows less about the
business than he does? Although disillusionment
has clouded (or perhaps cleared) my vision. I still
believe that incompetence in business and profes

sional endeavors is the exception rather than the
rule.
Incompetence is rare in the "real world" because
it is rampant here, in this "unreal world." For most
of us, college is the time of our greatest incom
petence. We're not yet in the "real world," hut of
ten we are given "real world" responsibility while
still in college. The result is massive incompetence.

Incompetence is rare in
the "real world'" because
it is rampant here, in this
"unreal world."

Fortunately, in college we can be incompetent
and get away with it. Because there is so much in
competence around, our small contribution to the
incompetence heap draws little attention and
causes much less damage than if we were in the
"real world."
In spite of all I've said, incompetence is not
something to be avoided. It's something to be en
countered and worked through. After all. incom
petence is one thing we all share.
However, some of us have more than others.
