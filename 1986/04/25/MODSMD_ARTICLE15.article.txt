Dorms just as bad
as the fraternities
Back about seven years ago, at
Stanford, the fellow students in my
living group played drinking games
openly in the halls, misused the fire
hoses at every given opportunity,
slung oranges (at some distance) at
the dorm across the street, had food
fights with annoying regularity and
flooded the third floor so badly the
entire carpet had to be ripped up and
replaced.
That was the year before I joined a
fraternity. All of those hijinks took
place at Branner Hall, where 180
adolescents were let loose on a vastly
outnumbered staff of resident assis
tants. And yet none of our misdeeds
ever made The Daily, nor were they
the cause, given our behavior, for
anyone to question freshmen's rights
to University housing, as your editor
ial board demands of fraternities in
its editorial of April 22.
Now, undoubtedly there is a signif
icant difference between hurling fruit
and the serious injury that occurred
at a rush party, last week, an incident
indefensible, and rightly so. But it
seems to me that when people get
injured in dorms — and certainly it
happens — more often than not it
gets written off as a schoolyard prank,
or even as just childish immaturity.
Contrast that, if you will, with the be
havior of fraternity members, who get
accused, en masse, of "violent and
repulsive actions" (The Daily's
words) any time a member of their or
another house steps out of line.
I don't question the University's
right to discipline individuals and
living groups when things get out of
hand, when either one deplorable in
cident or a string of lesser transgres
sions give evidence that either that
person or group of people has little
respect for the rights of others. By all
means punish the Delta Upsilons
(DUs) if you see fit, but I'm insulted,
as a fraternity member, if you group
me with someone who throws a
flaming couch off a second-floor bal
cony, as one of their members is
reputed to have done.
My point is this: Everyone at Stan
ford is bright enough, presumably, to
act as an individual. I dismiss the
myth, one The Daily loves to perpet
uate, that fraternities brainwash their
members into behaving like animals.
If you believe the DU house (and I
hate to keep using the example)

breeds anarchists, then you're
welcome to that opinion, but do not
use their lack of civility as a feeble
excuse to condemn the entire frater
nity system. Fraternities are as varied
as people themselves: each has its
own personality, and even that
changes from year to year. If you in
sist on drawing analogies from the
DUs, then you are obligated to do so
to the entire system of residential
education, not just the Greeks. Some
of us, believe it or not, are actually
pretty decent people.

Give focus houses
a chance to work
As reported in The Daily April 17,
a decision has been made not to
pursue the designation of Yost as a
focus house and not to priority-assign
20 percent of the house spaces for
next year. The story, however, may
have left the impression that the deci
sion was made in response to argu
ments against the focus house idea
presented in a letter from Yost resi
dents. Rather, the lack of time to
reach consensus on the desirability of
establishing Yost as a focus house was
the deciding factor.
Current Yost residents asserted
that Yost would have been seen as a
less attractive Draw choice because of
a focus designation. On the contrary,
a house with Yost's strengths, with
the addition of an indisputably ap
pealing set of activities on Latin
American/Iberian culture, would
have particularly appealed to many
Stanford students. Yost Resident Fel
low Edmundo Fuenzalida proposes
wonderful cultural programs — in
Latin American art, music and dance
— and access to such important fig
ures as the Nicaraguan ambassador to
the United States. In the view of
many, students who would not have
listed Yost as a Draw choice because
these cultural programs were part of a
designated focus would have been
losing out on a special opportunity.
The Yost residents' letter also
asserts that priority-assigned resi
dents, those who brought previous
background and experience into the
house, would not have been open to
new learning because of preconcep
tions about the culture. That simply
doesn't make sense. It is likely that.

had the priority idea been imple
mented, residents with previous ex
posure to the culture would have en
riched the study of Latin American
and Iberian life by sharing their expe
riences and motivating other resi
dents' interest. In addition, the
priority-assigned students would have
been a core group already organized
to assist the resident fellow with pro
gram development and the hosting of
faculty members affiliated with the
house because of their work in the
focus area. No students would have
been disadvantaged by the focus des
ignation or the priority assignments.
It is the case that students with re
turning residence priority would have
been able to be assured of returning
to Yost.
It is important to stress that desig
nating Yost as a focus house was to
have been an experiment in a
residence arrangement that was
halfway between a regular house,
with no emphasis on a shared intel
lectual or academic interest, and a
full-blown theme house. The focus
house idea was developed in response
to some students' desire to pursue
their interest in Latin Ameri
can/Iberian studies in a residence set
ting, through activities not available
in current academic programs. The
focus house experiment would have
had three components: a cluster of
activities each quarter on the focus
area, faculty fellows of the house in
the focus area and commitment to
working on programs. The experi
ment would have been a way of
showing students who share academic
and intellectual interests that they can
find structures within the residence
program to support their living to
gether, planning activities and getting
to know faculty members and other
residents who share their interests,
while at the same time participating
in the regular range of house activi
ties.
The goals of the focus house ex
periment are obviously worthwhile
and we will continue to pursue them.
No doubt other models will be
developed for programs that link aca
demic programs and residences. The
Office of Residential Education looks
forward to assisting students and fac
ulty members who have ideas for pro
grams which affiliate faculty members
to residences that house students
wishing to live together and share
their academic beliefs.

focus area. No students would have
been disadvantaged by the focus des
ignation or the priority assignments.
It is the case that students with re
turning residence priority would have
been able to be assured of returning
to Yost.
It is important to stress that desig
nating Yost as a focus house was to
have been an experiment in a
residence arrangement that was
halfway between a regular house,
with no emphasis on a shared intel
lectual or academic interest, and a
full-blown theme house. The focus
house idea was developed in response
to some students' desire to pursue
their interest in Latin Ameri
can/Iberian studies in a residence set
ting, through activities not available
in current academic programs. The
focus house experiment would have
had three components: a cluster of
activities each quarter on the focus
area, faculty fellows of the house in
the focus area and commitment to
working on programs. The experi
ment would have been a way of
showing students who share academic
and intellectual interests that they can
find structures within the residence
program to support their living to
gether, planning activities and getting
to know faculty members and other
residents who share their interests,
while at the same time participating
in the regular range of house activi
ties.
The goals of the focus house ex
periment are obviously worthwhile
and we will continue to pursue them.
No doubt other models will be
developed for programs that link aca
demic programs and residences. The
Office of Residential Education looks
forward to assisting students and fac
ulty members who have ideas for pro
grams which affiliate faculty members
to residences that house students
wishing to live together and share
their academic beliefs.

Dorms just as bad
as the fraternities
Back about seven years ago, at
Stanford, the fellow students in my
living group played drinking games
openly in the halls, misused the fire
hoses at every given opportunity,
slung oranges (at some distance) at
the dorm across the street, had food
fights with annoying regularity and
flooded the third floor so badly the
entire carpet had to be ripped up and
replaced.
That was the year before I joined a
fraternity. All of those hijinks took
place at Branner Hall, where 180
adolescents were let loose on a vastly
outnumbered staff of resident assis
tants. And yet none of our misdeeds
ever made The Daily, nor were they
the cause, given our behavior, for
anyone to question freshmen's rights
to University housing, as your editor
ial board demands of fraternities in
its editorial of April 22.
Now, undoubtedly there is a signif
icant difference between hurling fruit
and the serious injury that occurred
at a rush party, last week, an incident
indefensible, and rightly so. But it
seems to me that when people get
injured in dorms — and certainly it
happens — more often than not it
gets written off as a schoolyard prank,
or even as just childish immaturity.
Contrast that, if you will, with the be
havior of fraternity members, who get
accused, en masse, of "violent and
repulsive actions" (The Daily's
words) any time a member of their or
another house steps out of line.
I don't question the University's
right to discipline individuals and
living groups when things get out of
hand, when either one deplorable in
cident or a string of lesser transgres
sions give evidence that either that
person or group of people has little
respect for the rights of others. By all
means punish the Delta Upsilons
(DUs) if you see fit, but I'm insulted,
as a fraternity member, if you group
me with someone who throws a
flaming couch off a second-floor bal
cony, as one of their members is
reputed to have done.
My point is this: Everyone at Stan
ford is bright enough, presumably, to
act as an individual. I dismiss the
myth, one The Daily loves to perpet
uate, that fraternities brainwash their
members into behaving like animals.
If you believe the DU house (and I
hate to keep using the example)

breeds anarchists, then you're
welcome to that opinion, but do not
use their lack of civility as a feeble
excuse to condemn the entire frater
nity system. Fraternities are as varied
as people themselves: each has its
own personality, and even that
changes from year to year. If you in
sist on drawing analogies from the
DUs, then you are obligated to do so
to the entire system of residential
education, not just the Greeks. Some
of us, believe it or not, are actually
pretty decent people.

Give focus houses
a chance to work
As reported in The Daily April 17,
a decision has been made not to
pursue the designation of Yost as a
focus house and not to priority-assign
20 percent of the house spaces for
next year. The story, however, may
have left the impression that the deci
sion was made in response to argu
ments against the focus house idea
presented in a letter from Yost resi
dents. Rather, the lack of time to
reach consensus on the desirability of
establishing Yost as a focus house was
the deciding factor.
Current Yost residents asserted
that Yost would have been seen as a
less attractive Draw choice because of
a focus designation. On the contrary,
a house with Yost's strengths, with
the addition of an indisputably ap
pealing set of activities on Latin
American/Iberian culture, would
have particularly appealed to many
Stanford students. Yost Resident Fel
low Edmundo Fuenzalida proposes
wonderful cultural programs — in
Latin American art, music and dance
— and access to such important fig
ures as the Nicaraguan ambassador to
the United States. In the view of
many, students who would not have
listed Yost as a Draw choice because
these cultural programs were part of a
designated focus would have been
losing out on a special opportunity.
The Yost residents' letter also
asserts that priority-assigned resi
dents, those who brought previous
background and experience into the
house, would not have been open to
new learning because of preconcep
tions about the culture. That simply
doesn't make sense. It is likely that.

had the priority idea been imple
mented, residents with previous ex
posure to the culture would have en
riched the study of Latin American
and Iberian life by sharing their expe
riences and motivating other resi
dents' interest. In addition, the
priority-assigned students would have
been a core group already organized
to assist the resident fellow with pro
gram development and the hosting of
faculty members affiliated with the
house because of their work in the
focus area. No students would have
been disadvantaged by the focus des
ignation or the priority assignments.
It is the case that students with re
turning residence priority would have
