### MARCUS MABRY Staff writer 
Nineteen protesters calling for open access to
animal research facilities were arrested yester
day after occupying the fifth floor of Jordan
Hall for more than three hours.
Calling themselves the April 24 Coalition, the
group of 70 protesters from various animal
rights groups entered Jordan Hall, which houses
the Psychology Department, around 11 a.m.
and demanded immediate entry to the labora
tory facilities.
None of the protesters were Stanford stu
dents, according to Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington.

Most of the protesters evacuated the floor
and stairwell after Psychology Department
Chairman Ewart Thomas asked them to
evacuate the premises and declared the building
off-limits to all non-employees. He also warned
that the University had authorized the forcible
removal of the protesters.
Around 2 p.m., Stanford police cited the 19
remaining protesters for unlawful assembly,
trespassing and failure to disperse, Herrington
said.
Sgt. Nick Bruno said the protesters were
peaceful and gave " 100 percent cooperation."
The protesters, who were blocking an unauth
orized area of the Psychology [Department and
picketing outside of Jordan, staged the protest
to coincide with National Laboratory Animal
Day. The day was marked by protests at various
college campuses across the nation.
The Stanford group said it had no leader, but
Cindy Simionato, the group's press representa
tive, listed the protester's demands.
"We want unscheduled access to research
facilities by doctors and other professionals, stu
dents' right of consciousness not to dissect or
vivisect animals to be protected, pets not be
used in laboratory experiments, and meaningful
dialogue between animal rights organizations
and university researchers," Simionato said.
"This is just the start of an ongoing cam
paign," she said.
The remaining protesters began shouting to

be allowed to see the animals in the laborato
ries. Thomas said that would not be possible.
"We are prepared to show you the lab at a
scheduled time," he said. "We have good
reasons (for not showing you the labs now).
Today is not the most opportune time."
Since January, the University has shown its
animal research facilities to 90 scheduled indi
viduals and groups, mainly those concerned
with animal rights, according to Dr. Thomas
Hamm, director of the Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine.
Hamm noted that 10 representatives of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) had made
an unannounced visit to Stanford laboratories
earlier this month and indicated the University
was in full compliance with NIH guidelines.
"We're being visited constantly," he said.
Will Parker, a protester who didn't remain
inside the building and a member of the group
In Defense of Animals, said that scheduled lab
oratory loin's were superficial and planned to
hide the nature of some of the University ex
periments.
Parker said at least 14 other campuses in Cal
ifornia were being picketed.
He said protesters chose Jordan Hall as the
Stanford site "because it has easy access. This is
not a animal-liberation force. We're simply
coming to observe."
Dahl Stanley, who earlier this week fasted in
a cage in White Plaza for more than 70 hours in
protest of animal research, said that if the Uni
versity had nothing to hide, it would have let the
protesters see the animals.
For more than an hour and a half, the sit-in
continued with only minor clashes between
building security and demonstrators who
wanted to be allowed into the secured sections
of the corridor.
At that time, Simionato said,"We'll sit here
until they let us in. We'll sit here forever if we
have to."
By 1:45 p.m., after issuing two more warn
ings, police cordoned off all access to the fifth
floor, including elevators that could reach it.
The protesters were no longer allowed to come
and go.
Shortly thereafter, police began arresting the
