# 19 arrested opposing animal research here
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Staff writer 
Nineteen protesters calling for open access to
animal research facilities were arrested yester
day after occupying the fifth floor of Jordan
Hall for more than three hours.
Calling themselves the April 24 Coalition, the
group of 70 protesters from various animal
rights groups entered Jordan Hall, which houses
the Psychology Department, around 11 a.m.
and demanded immediate entry to the labora
tory facilities.
None of the protesters were Stanford stu
dents, according to Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington.

Most of the protesters evacuated the floor
and stairwell after Psychology Department
Chairman Ewart Thomas asked them to
evacuate the premises and declared the building
off-limits to all non-employees. He also warned
that the University had authorized the forcible
removal of the protesters.
Around 2 p.m., Stanford police cited the 19
remaining protesters for unlawful assembly,
trespassing and failure to disperse, Herrington
said.
Sgt. Nick Bruno said the protesters were
peaceful and gave " 100 percent cooperation."
The protesters, who were blocking an unauth
orized area of the Psychology [Department and
picketing outside of Jordan, staged the protest
to coincide with National Laboratory Animal
Day. The day was marked by protests at various
college campuses across the nation.
The Stanford group said it had no leader, but
Cindy Simionato, the group's press representa
tive, listed the protester's demands.
"We want unscheduled access to research
facilities by doctors and other professionals, stu
dents' right of consciousness not to dissect or
vivisect animals to be protected, pets not be
used in laboratory experiments, and meaningful
dialogue between animal rights organizations
and university researchers," Simionato said.
"This is just the start of an ongoing cam
paign," she said.
The remaining protesters began shouting to

be allowed to see the animals in the laborato
ries. Thomas said that would not be possible.
"We are prepared to show you the lab at a
scheduled time," he said. "We have good
reasons (for not showing you the labs now).
Today is not the most opportune time."
Since January, the University has shown its
animal research facilities to 90 scheduled indi
viduals and groups, mainly those concerned
with animal rights, according to Dr. Thomas
Hamm, director of the Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine.
Hamm noted that 10 representatives of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) had made
an unannounced visit to Stanford laboratories
earlier this month and indicated the University
was in full compliance with NIH guidelines.
"We're being visited constantly," he said.
Will Parker, a protester who didn't remain
inside the building and a member of the group
In Defense of Animals, said that scheduled lab
oratory loin's were superficial and planned to
hide the nature of some of the University ex
periments.
Parker said at least 14 other campuses in Cal
ifornia were being picketed.
He said protesters chose Jordan Hall as the
Stanford site "because it has easy access. This is
not a animal-liberation force. We're simply
coming to observe."
Dahl Stanley, who earlier this week fasted in
a cage in White Plaza for more than 70 hours in
protest of animal research, said that if the Uni
versity had nothing to hide, it would have let the
protesters see the animals.
For more than an hour and a half, the sit-in
continued with only minor clashes between
building security and demonstrators who
wanted to be allowed into the secured sections
of the corridor.
At that time, Simionato said,"We'll sit here
until they let us in. We'll sit here forever if we
have to."
By 1:45 p.m., after issuing two more warn
ings, police cordoned off all access to the fifth
floor, including elevators that could reach it.
The protesters were no longer allowed to come
and go.
Shortly thereafter, police began arresting the
protesters, three of which were
minors. Police began transporting
protesters to a compound near Stan
ford Stadium. All 19 were cited and
released.
When the protesters left Jordan
Hall, they were greeted by applause
from their fellow demonstrators as
they were escorted out of the back
entrance of the building.
At a press conference held after the
arrests. Psychology Prof. Richard
Thompson, who conducts research at
Jordan, said. "We have a general
policy that anyone who wants to see
our laboratories can arrange a tour.
The protesters disrupted all of our
work. We had to shut down every
thing."
Thompson emphasized that the re
search in which these laboratories
were involved was crucial to the bet
ter health of humankind. "Our re
search is concerned with how
memories are formed in the mam
malian brain. Our goal is to under
stand how memory is formed in the
human brain," he said.
Thompson also said the research is
crucial to the development of a cure
for Alzheimer's disease and for learn
ing and mental disabilities.
Thompson outlined the various
safeguards that insure the correct

treatment of animals.
"There's a committee of scientists
(some who do animal research and
some who don't) and lay people who
review every technique of animal re
search, of which I am currently a
member, and it must approve all
techniques before investigators even
start to use them."

He also said that the Animal
Welfare Act and the NIH have strict
guidelines for animal treatment. Uni
versity researchers are subject to spot
checks by agents of government or
ganizations such as the NIH and the
Department of Agriculture.
Asked if he believed the protesters'
cause had merit, he replied, "There is

always merit to any cause. There is no
merit at all to coming out here today
like they did and disrupting the work
as they have."
Hamm said "the current NIH regu
lations were made by society, not by
scientists" and that research is start
ing to be hurt by the large number of
restrictions.

"We are prepared to show you the lab at a
scheduled time," he said. "We have good
reasons (for not showing you the labs now).
Today is not the most opportune time."
Since January, the University has shown its
animal research facilities to 90 scheduled indi
viduals and groups, mainly those concerned
with animal rights, according to Dr. Thomas
Hamm, director of the Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine.
Hamm noted that 10 representatives of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) had made
an unannounced visit to Stanford laboratories
earlier this month and indicated the University
was in full compliance with NIH guidelines.
"We're being visited constantly," he said.
Will Parker, a protester who didn't remain
inside the building and a member of the group
In Defense of Animals, said that scheduled lab
oratory loin's were superficial and planned to
hide the nature of some of the University ex
periments.
Parker said at least 14 other campuses in Cal
ifornia were being picketed.
He said protesters chose Jordan Hall as the
Stanford site "because it has easy access. This is
not a animal-liberation force. We're simply
coming to observe."
Dahl Stanley, who earlier this week fasted in
a cage in White Plaza for more than 70 hours in
protest of animal research, said that if the Uni
versity had nothing to hide, it would have let the
protesters see the animals.
For more than an hour and a half, the sit-in
continued with only minor clashes between
building security and demonstrators who
wanted to be allowed into the secured sections
of the corridor.
At that time, Simionato said,"We'll sit here
until they let us in. We'll sit here forever if we
have to."
By 1:45 p.m., after issuing two more warn
ings, police cordoned off all access to the fifth
floor, including elevators that could reach it.
The protesters were no longer allowed to come
and go.
Shortly thereafter, police began arresting the
protesters, three of which were
minors. Police began transporting
protesters to a compound near Stan
ford Stadium. All 19 were cited and
released.
When the protesters left Jordan
Hall, they were greeted by applause
from their fellow demonstrators as
they were escorted out of the back
entrance of the building.
At a press conference held after the
arrests. Psychology Prof. Richard
Thompson, who conducts research at
Jordan, said. "We have a general
policy that anyone who wants to see
our laboratories can arrange a tour.
The protesters disrupted all of our
work. We had to shut down every
thing."
Thompson emphasized that the re
search in which these laboratories
were involved was crucial to the bet
ter health of humankind. "Our re
search is concerned with how
memories are formed in the mam
malian brain. Our goal is to under
stand how memory is formed in the
human brain," he said.
Thompson also said the research is
crucial to the development of a cure
for Alzheimer's disease and for learn
ing and mental disabilities.
Thompson outlined the various
safeguards that insure the correct

treatment of animals.
"There's a committee of scientists
(some who do animal research and
some who don't) and lay people who
review every technique of animal re
search, of which I am currently a
member, and it must approve all
techniques before investigators even
start to use them."

He also said that the Animal
Welfare Act and the NIH have strict
guidelines for animal treatment. Uni
versity researchers are subject to spot
checks by agents of government or
ganizations such as the NIH and the
Department of Agriculture.
Asked if he believed the protesters'
cause had merit, he replied, "There is

always merit to any cause. There is no
merit at all to coming out here today
like they did and disrupting the work
as they have."
Hamm said "the current NIH regu
lations were made by society, not by
scientists" and that research is start
ing to be hurt by the large number of
restrictions.

A Stanford police officer speaks to a group of demonstrators who staged a sit-in yesterday at Jordan Hall pro
testing animal research. The hall houses the Psychology Department and research laboratories.
Nineteen protesters calling for open access to
animal research facilities were arrested yester
day after occupying the fifth floor of Jordan
Hall for more than three hours.
Calling themselves the April 24 Coalition, the
group of 70 protesters from various animal
rights groups entered Jordan Hall, which houses
the Psychology Department, around 11 a.m.
and demanded immediate entry to the labora
tory facilities.
None of the protesters were Stanford stu
dents, according to Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington.

Most of the protesters evacuated the floor
and stairwell after Psychology Department
Chairman Ewart Thomas asked them to
evacuate the premises and declared the building
off-limits to all non-employees. He also warned
that the University had authorized the forcible
removal of the protesters.
Around 2 p.m., Stanford police cited the 19
remaining protesters for unlawful assembly,
trespassing and failure to disperse, Herrington
said.
Sgt. Nick Bruno said the protesters were
peaceful and gave " 100 percent cooperation."
The protesters, who were blocking an unauth
orized area of the Psychology [Department and
picketing outside of Jordan, staged the protest
to coincide with National Laboratory Animal
Day. The day was marked by protests at various
college campuses across the nation.
The Stanford group said it had no leader, but
Cindy Simionato, the group's press representa
tive, listed the protester's demands.
"We want unscheduled access to research
facilities by doctors and other professionals, stu
dents' right of consciousness not to dissect or
vivisect animals to be protected, pets not be
used in laboratory experiments, and meaningful
dialogue between animal rights organizations
and university researchers," Simionato said.
"This is just the start of an ongoing cam
paign," she said.
The remaining protesters began shouting to

be allowed to see the animals in the laborato
ries. Thomas said that would not be possible.
"We are prepared to show you the lab at a
scheduled time," he said. "We have good
reasons (for not showing you the labs now).
