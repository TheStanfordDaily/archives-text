## Oh to go as a pro fro ho 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
If you wanna buy a car, go see Cal.
For a better deal by far, f>o see Cal.
If you wanna car or truck,
ami you'd like to save a buck,
Go see Cal.
Go see Cal.
Go see Cal.
For those of you who didn't grow up
watching Orange County local TV commer
cials, and were thus deprived of Cal Wor
thington and his dog Spot, the idea of a Roy
Rogers wanna-be in baby blue fringe cajol
ing a camel to walk between rows of used
Subarus and Chevy Chevettes may sound
surreal.
Picture a Texan accent rolling over the
airwaves like a tumbleweed: " Ah'd stand on
mah hade to make you a deal!" he grins to
the folks at home as the camel bounces him
on his 10-gallon topknot.
Even Marlon Perkins sends Jim out to
wrestle the big alligators while he stays
home in Mutual of Omaha, Nebraska, and
reads the cue cards.
But Cal's a good-ole-boy and he'll be in
terrupting Channel 13's Gomer Pyle re-runs
next week with an even better-behaved Spot
— an antenna-munching hippopotamus, a
toothsome frumious bandersnatch, fuzzy
furred gophers from Singapore, or an Opus
look-alike that refuses to heel, choosing in
stead to nest on the pointy toes of Cal's

lizard-skin Tony Lamas.
Everyone's buying or selling something.
Pro fros bombarding campus in "Le Petit
Prince" style, expecting an elephant-eating

boa coastrictor to slither up to them with the
answer to their dilemma: "I'm trying to
choose between Harvard and here."
Pro fro hosts pontificating with the au
thority of Siskel and Ebert about the fre
quency of earthquakes, the correlation be
tween fro yo and the freshman 15, the sud

den loss of hot shower water when a toilet
flushes, the laundering and inebriating influ
ence of quarters, and California Registered
Historical Landmark No. 825 (Zott's), com
plete with juke box and rectangular ham
burger patties.
Even I was lured in by this Cal Wor
thington/used car salesman lifestyle, not
knowing the consequences.
I went into shock: I made my bed: I
became a Pro Fro Ho. . .
"Hi, my name's So hi mi! I am a Pro Fro!
So far, I'm pretty sure I'm coming to Stan
ford. . . aren't you guys lucky?! Hee lice hee!
A-000-gah! A-000-gah! DIVE, DIVE,
DIVE. Commence anti-Pro Fro maneuvers!
Load acronym assault weapon! Rampant
Pro Fro located on radar at 12 o'clock, sir!
Aim! Fire! (::(:(SWOPSI CERAS IFC
UAC/AIC SOSA SASA A ASA TSD):)::)
Except for a little fallout from the shock
waves, I think we're safe now.
When I was a senior in high school I
thought that if I got within five miles of the
Claw before Orientation Weekend they
would look at me funny and tell me to go
home until my turn came up.
Kids nowadays don't go through any of
that shaving cream. "Is Foamy Gel thick
enough to stop this speeding Pro Fro?" Not
hardly.
But hey, they think they're getting a great
deal. They haven't paid over $5,000 for a
flimsy paper ID card that disintegrates in the
dryer yet.
