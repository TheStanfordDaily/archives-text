## Up, up and away... in a beautiful balloon 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN JOHN SAGE 
This is the first article in a two-part
series on Nupu Volley. Stories on
wine-tasting and hotels in the area will
appear in next Friday's issue.
Our pilot, Bob Barbarick, guided
our brightly colored balloon toward
the field below. Glancing quickly left
and right he announced, "No mean
horses or angry neighbors — prepare
to land!" He fired a short blast of hot
air to shift our lateral direction, and
we glided softly to the earth.
Pronouncing the flight an un
qualified success, Bob pointed toward
the ground crew and informed us that
the trip was not yet complete.
"Follow them for the picnic of your
life," he instructed.
Ballooning was not always such a
pleasant sport. Mans first attempts to
conquer the skies were in balloons.
The first successful manned balloon
flight occurred in 1783 when the
Marquis d'Arlandes flew five miles
over the palace of the King and
Queen of France. But not all early at
tempts were quite so successful. In
1897, a Frenchman named Andre
and two companions took off by bal
loon from Spitzbergen in the first at
tempt te pass over the North Pole.
Their frozen bodies were found in
1933 only a few miles from where
they started.
Thanks to advances in both balloon
technology and weather forecasting,
ballooning is now a very safe experi
ence. However, the romance of a bal
loon flight remains intact. Ballooning
is still a sport governed by nature;
winds alone determine the direction
and speed of flight.
Because weather is never an exact
science, guests can call the balloon
companies both the night before their

flight and at 5 a.m. on flight day to
check on the latest FAA weather
conditions. We tried flying with two
of Napa's largest and most well
established balloon companies —
Adventures Aloft and Napa Valley
Balloons, Inc.
Although actual flight time in bal
looning is only an hour or so, the
"total experience" is a day-long ad
venture. The day begins with a pre
sunrise confirmation call to the bal
loon company's offices. Fog, rain and
wind are the bane of balloonists and
can scrub flights with little notice.
Fortunately, April through October
are usually beautiful months for bal
looning.
Upon receiving the "green light"
confirmation, passengers make the'ir
way to the rendezvous sites: a small
park in Yountville for Napa Valley
Balloons; the Clarion Hotel in Napa
for Adventuures Aloft.
At about 6 a.m. the pilots and crew
arrive and begin circulating among
the expectant flyers. Before long, the
laughter and enthusiasm of the crew
make everyone forget about the
ridiculously early hour.
Hot air balloons are manufactured
in only four spots worldwide. Napa
Valley Balloons' crafts come from
North Carolina while most of Ad
venture Aloft's fleet comes from South
Dakota. The balloons are made of
over 1,000 yards of brightly colored
fabric. They can hold up to 105,000
cubic feet of hot air and range in price
from $15,000 to $30,000 each. State
standards demand that the fabric be
replaced every 300-400 hours of
flight time.
With the sun just over the horizon
and the valley fog slowly dissipating,
the ground crew prepared the craft
for launch. The balloons, which
minutes before had resembled old
family tents packed up in canvas bags.

made loud "thuds" as they hit the
dirt. It was difficult to imagine that in
less than 30 minutes, this bundle of
fabric and cable could get off the
ground.
Large fans provided the initial How
of air, and the balloons slowly began
to take shape. If you're lucky, the
pilots will allow you to stand inside
the huge balloon as they begin filling
it. Suddenly, with a flash of bright or
ange flame, two large propane tanks
begin filling the craft with hot air.
After a minute or two, the balloons
are full, straining at their mooring
ropes, anxious to head for the wild
blue yonder.
We boarded the large basket (most
commerical balloons carry from four
to eight passengers plus an FAA
certified pilot), the crew cut our ropes
and off we soared. The silent, smooth
ascent is almost surreal. We glided
noiselessly upward as the sounds of
earth faded into the distance. Since
the balloon flies at exactly the speed
of the wind, there is no breeze, no
noise, just quiet beauty.
The quiet tranquility of the flight
was punctuated only occasionally by
the roar of the propane burner's over
head. The scenery is spectacular:
fading fog banks locked into the val
ley, Mt. Tamalpais and Mt. Diablo
towering in the distance, the quilt
line pattern of the farms and vine
yards below and the colorful sight of
other balloons above and below.
Each pilot has his own unique style.
Pilot Drew Brisbane of Adventures
Aloft took us south down the Napa
Valley as he pointed out wineries, fa
mous homes, mountains and more.
His knowledge of the area was insur
passable. Between pointing out sights
he awed us with his travel stories. As
a balloon pilot he has often led bal
loon trips through Europe and the
Middle East. Last year he even

gained permission to fly his balloon in
China.
Barbarick, of Napa Valley Bal
loons, regaled lis with stories of his
most memorable flights: crazed
skydivers who jumped from the bal
loon while the pilots were looking the
other way. young couples who got
married in mid-flight, passengers
looking for membership in the "mile
high club." (Ask your pilot. After all,
this is a family newspaper.)
While our flights were very similar
with the two companies, each has its
own unique flair. Adventures Aloft is
an extremely professional, well
managed company. Their after-flight
champagne celebration was an ele
gant outdoor affair served at a cafe
located in the Vintage 1870 shopping
mall. Champagne and classical music
accompanied the presentation of
flight certificates to the passengers.
For reservations or information call
Adventures Aloft at 707-255-8688.
Balloon trips cost from $ 140 per per
son, including post-flight champagne
brunch.
Napa Valley Balloons portrays a
much more casual atmosphere: it
seems that the pilots and ground crew
are one large, happy family. Our
post-flight picnic was a wild bash on
the shores of a nearby lake. Debbie
Bolander, a professional caterer (and
wife of Pilot Ron), prepared a spec
tacular spread that could keep the
Stanford football team's training
table stocked for a week. Passengers
underwent a ceremonial champagne
dunking and souvenir photos were
presented. Ceramic pins were handed
out to commemorate the day.
Reservations or information are
available at 707-253-2224 or toll free
at 800-253-2224. Balloon flight fares
start at $145 per person including the
post-flight picnic.

replaced every 300-400 hours of
flight time.
With the sun just over the horizon
and the valley fog slowly dissipating,
the ground crew prepared the craft
for launch. The balloons, which
minutes before had resembled old
family tents packed up in canvas bags.

made loud "thuds" as they hit the
dirt. It was difficult to imagine that in
less than 30 minutes, this bundle of
fabric and cable could get off the
ground.
Large fans provided the initial How
of air, and the balloons slowly began
to take shape. If you're lucky, the
pilots will allow you to stand inside
the huge balloon as they begin filling
it. Suddenly, with a flash of bright or
ange flame, two large propane tanks
begin filling the craft with hot air.
After a minute or two, the balloons
are full, straining at their mooring
ropes, anxious to head for the wild
blue yonder.
We boarded the large basket (most
commerical balloons carry from four
to eight passengers plus an FAA
certified pilot), the crew cut our ropes
and off we soared. The silent, smooth
ascent is almost surreal. We glided
noiselessly upward as the sounds of
earth faded into the distance. Since
the balloon flies at exactly the speed
of the wind, there is no breeze, no
noise, just quiet beauty.
The quiet tranquility of the flight
was punctuated only occasionally by
the roar of the propane burner's over
head. The scenery is spectacular:
fading fog banks locked into the val
ley, Mt. Tamalpais and Mt. Diablo
towering in the distance, the quilt
line pattern of the farms and vine
yards below and the colorful sight of
other balloons above and below.
Each pilot has his own unique style.
Pilot Drew Brisbane of Adventures
Aloft took us south down the Napa
Valley as he pointed out wineries, fa
mous homes, mountains and more.
His knowledge of the area was insur
passable. Between pointing out sights
he awed us with his travel stories. As
a balloon pilot he has often led bal
loon trips through Europe and the
Middle East. Last year he even

gained permission to fly his balloon in
China.
Barbarick, of Napa Valley Bal
loons, regaled lis with stories of his
most memorable flights: crazed
skydivers who jumped from the bal
loon while the pilots were looking the
other way. young couples who got
married in mid-flight, passengers
looking for membership in the "mile
high club." (Ask your pilot. After all,
this is a family newspaper.)
While our flights were very similar
with the two companies, each has its
own unique flair. Adventures Aloft is
an extremely professional, well
managed company. Their after-flight
champagne celebration was an ele
gant outdoor affair served at a cafe
located in the Vintage 1870 shopping
mall. Champagne and classical music
accompanied the presentation of
flight certificates to the passengers.
For reservations or information call
Adventures Aloft at 707-255-8688.
Balloon trips cost from $ 140 per per
son, including post-flight champagne
brunch.
Napa Valley Balloons portrays a
much more casual atmosphere: it
seems that the pilots and ground crew
are one large, happy family. Our
post-flight picnic was a wild bash on
the shores of a nearby lake. Debbie
Bolander, a professional caterer (and
wife of Pilot Ron), prepared a spec
tacular spread that could keep the
Stanford football team's training
table stocked for a week. Passengers
underwent a ceremonial champagne
dunking and souvenir photos were
presented. Ceramic pins were handed
out to commemorate the day.
Reservations or information are
available at 707-253-2224 or toll free
at 800-253-2224. Balloon flight fares
start at $145 per person including the
post-flight picnic.

The 360-degree view from one of the many hot-air balloons operating in
Napa Valley is "the adventure of a lifetime."
This is the first article in a two-part
series on Nupu Volley. Stories on
wine-tasting and hotels in the area will
appear in next Friday's issue.
Our pilot, Bob Barbarick, guided
our brightly colored balloon toward
the field below. Glancing quickly left
and right he announced, "No mean
horses or angry neighbors — prepare
to land!" He fired a short blast of hot
air to shift our lateral direction, and
we glided softly to the earth.
Pronouncing the flight an un
qualified success, Bob pointed toward
the ground crew and informed us that
the trip was not yet complete.
"Follow them for the picnic of your
life," he instructed.
Ballooning was not always such a
pleasant sport. Mans first attempts to
conquer the skies were in balloons.
The first successful manned balloon
flight occurred in 1783 when the
Marquis d'Arlandes flew five miles
over the palace of the King and
Queen of France. But not all early at
tempts were quite so successful. In
1897, a Frenchman named Andre
and two companions took off by bal
loon from Spitzbergen in the first at
tempt te pass over the North Pole.
Their frozen bodies were found in
1933 only a few miles from where
they started.
Thanks to advances in both balloon
technology and weather forecasting,
ballooning is now a very safe experi
ence. However, the romance of a bal
loon flight remains intact. Ballooning
is still a sport governed by nature;
winds alone determine the direction
and speed of flight.
Because weather is never an exact
science, guests can call the balloon
companies both the night before their

flight and at 5 a.m. on flight day to
check on the latest FAA weather
conditions. We tried flying with two
of Napa's largest and most well
established balloon companies —
Adventures Aloft and Napa Valley
Balloons, Inc.
Although actual flight time in bal
looning is only an hour or so, the
"total experience" is a day-long ad
venture. The day begins with a pre
sunrise confirmation call to the bal
loon company's offices. Fog, rain and
wind are the bane of balloonists and
can scrub flights with little notice.
Fortunately, April through October
are usually beautiful months for bal
looning.
Upon receiving the "green light"
confirmation, passengers make the'ir
way to the rendezvous sites: a small
park in Yountville for Napa Valley
Balloons; the Clarion Hotel in Napa
for Adventuures Aloft.
At about 6 a.m. the pilots and crew
arrive and begin circulating among
the expectant flyers. Before long, the
laughter and enthusiasm of the crew
make everyone forget about the
ridiculously early hour.
Hot air balloons are manufactured
in only four spots worldwide. Napa
Valley Balloons' crafts come from
North Carolina while most of Ad
venture Aloft's fleet comes from South
Dakota. The balloons are made of
over 1,000 yards of brightly colored
fabric. They can hold up to 105,000
cubic feet of hot air and range in price
from $15,000 to $30,000 each. State
standards demand that the fabric be
replaced every 300-400 hours of
flight time.
