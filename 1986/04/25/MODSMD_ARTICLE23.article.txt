## There's gold and platinum, and then there is the rust 
### LARRY WEBER Editorial staff 
New albums sit in proud stacks
close to the registers. Records by
Whitney Houston, Bruce Springsteen
and other artists riding current waves
of popularity are in stacks and stacks:
music by bulk, an earful for everyone,
a single song worth a million bucks,
reprintings and new shipments and
more millions.
But not all is glitter and gold and
platinum. What about the forgotten
names and titles that lay sandwiched
and bound together by old sticky cel
lophane? What about the ones that
wouldn't, didn't or can't sell — not
the gold and platinum of the music in
dustry, but the rust.
The unsellables would make a very
long list. The following is a condensa
tion of that list, the record store rust,
to a quantity that one can hopefully
stomach in a single reading . No con
sensus, collaboration or cooperation
led to the compilation of this list. It
was drawn by a committee of one,
which echoes its inevitable incon
clusiveness and will result in the
equally inevitable disagreement and
disappointment of other individual
committees.
1. Engelbert Humperdinck — Last
of the Romantics Store Price: $3.99
The name alone, which probably
took days, maybe weeks, to
brainstorm, seems absurd enough.
But his album titles sail over the peak
of absurdity, reasserting whatever
was asserted when a mind decided to
name itself Engelbert Humperdinck.
"The Ultimate Engelbert Humper
dinck" and "Miracles by Engelert
Humperdinck" helped the dreamy
eyed swooner settle into a special
place in all of our mushy hearts.
A look at the cover of his 1978
release "Last of the Romantics" will

immediately reveal Humperdinck at
his absurd best, more miraculous than
"Miracles" and surpassing "The Ul
timate."
Picture our hero of love in some
lucky woman's arms, staring so
deeply into her eyes that it looks as if
he is either going to kiss her entire
soul or bite her head off.
Like the rest of Humperdinck's of
ferings, this album features the best
songs written by other artists. Per
haps they let him record them for a
joke. "I'wonder what he'll do to this
one?" they might ask. The rust thick
ens.
2.Jim Nabors Sings The Lord's
Prayers and other sacred songs No
price tag (free?)
Well, maybe we should be glad he
k not reading from the New Testa

ment. "He was as dead as a runover
skunk, but then they went to check
him, and the rock had moved, and
SURPRISE! SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!. .
Aside from the classics, like " Rock
of Ages" and "Battle Hymn of the
Republic," Gomer's affectionate bass
guides us through "Just A Closer
Walk With Thee," "Holy Holy
Holy," and"The Old Rugged Cross."
There are others, rest assured. The
album is a condensed version of
Nabors* opus tribute to his favorite
religion, the double-album "How
Great Thou Art," and it has no
recording date printed on it, which
reflects the timelessness of the faith
itself. Of course, someone like Bing
Crosby probably has an album with a
similar song list, which if played,
would not topple furniture and

torture the sensitive ears of neighbor
hood dogs.
3. Blossom Dearie — May I Come
In? Store Price: $3.99
The cover photo of red-lipped
Blossom Dearie — with her platinum
hair neatly tucked into her snug black
fur coat — when considered with the
album's engaging question-title,
makes this 1964 release a record ex
ecutive's marketing dream. Twenty
two years of store-life later, Blossom
still asks her question.
The text on the back of the album
reads, "No belter she. No leather
lunged strident-voiced seller of songs
is Blossom Dearie. Here is the light
polite voice, the caress with a kick in
it, ingenuous but hip. And she doesn't
sell, she gives it away."
Without inquiring into what it is

that Dearie actually gives away, for
that is open to interpretation and
might only be answered by her or by a
listen to this unpurchasable album,
one might be able to conclude from
the quote that this woman is able to
sing.
The text continues, "This is Blos
som's first album for Capitol. Dearie
fans will rejoice."
No fan club address was listed,
however, and no explanation of the
origin of her name was given. Layers
of rust have formed over such un
answered questions.
4. Adolf Hitler — The Reichstag
Speech Store Price: $6.99
Finally, it is in the stores — the dul
cet sound of the Fuhrer's meanest
speaking voice. With blood boiling

through his remarkably resilient vocal
cords, Hitler takes time out to an
nounce his army's invasion of Poland
in his stunning, rumbling tenor.
The album cover boasts, "Never
before on record," "complete speech
text enclosed" and "playable on both
mono and stereo equipment." The
audio enthusiast might want to plug
in his equalizer for this one, just to
clean out the extraneous noise and
hone in on those barks and poundings
on the podium that really got the
Nazis frothing.
5. Lawrence Welk and Myron
Floren — 24 Greatest Polkas Store
Price: $7.99
The immediate question that
comes to mind is how did these two
accordion aficionados narrow their
favorite polkas down to the humble
number of 24?
Welk and Floren include the time
less "Tick Tock Polka," the
uproarious "Strip Polka," the free
spirited "Happy Wanderer" polka,
the snappy "Chihuaha Polka" and 20
other polka standards.
The treat on the album is a polka
rendition of the Walt Disney classic
"It's a Small World," exhibiting an
unexpected versatility among the ac
cordion pumpers.
This album has developed a consid
erable amount of rust, like its previ
ously reviewed list partners. None of
these albums are in danger of ever
being bought, along with the follow
ing two honorable mentions: "Robert
Goulet's Greatest Hits," featuring
such universally hummable tunes as
"Fortissimo" and "Real Live Girl";
and"The Top 10 Barbershop Quar
tets of 1969," which is highlighted by
the smooth harmonies of that year's
international champion group "Mark
4," and boasts the lowest price for a
full-length album that this particular
record store article offers — $3.44.


Lawrence Welk's and Myron Floren's "24 Greatest Polkas" is one of many albums that is unlikely to ever be bought.

origin of her name was given. Layers
of rust have formed over such un
answered questions.
4. Adolf Hitler — The Reichstag
Speech Store Price: $6.99
Finally, it is in the stores — the dul
cet sound of the Fuhrer's meanest
speaking voice. With blood boiling

through his remarkably resilient vocal
cords, Hitler takes time out to an
nounce his army's invasion of Poland
in his stunning, rumbling tenor.
The album cover boasts, "Never
before on record," "complete speech
text enclosed" and "playable on both
mono and stereo equipment." The
audio enthusiast might want to plug
in his equalizer for this one, just to
clean out the extraneous noise and
hone in on those barks and poundings
on the podium that really got the
Nazis frothing.
5. Lawrence Welk and Myron
Floren — 24 Greatest Polkas Store
Price: $7.99
The immediate question that
comes to mind is how did these two
accordion aficionados narrow their
favorite polkas down to the humble
number of 24?
Welk and Floren include the time
less "Tick Tock Polka," the
uproarious "Strip Polka," the free
spirited "Happy Wanderer" polka,
the snappy "Chihuaha Polka" and 20
other polka standards.
The treat on the album is a polka
rendition of the Walt Disney classic
"It's a Small World," exhibiting an
unexpected versatility among the ac
cordion pumpers.
This album has developed a consid
erable amount of rust, like its previ
ously reviewed list partners. None of
these albums are in danger of ever
being bought, along with the follow
ing two honorable mentions: "Robert
Goulet's Greatest Hits," featuring
such universally hummable tunes as
"Fortissimo" and "Real Live Girl";
and"The Top 10 Barbershop Quar
tets of 1969," which is highlighted by
the smooth harmonies of that year's
international champion group "Mark
4," and boasts the lowest price for a
full-length album that this particular
record store article offers — $3.44.


Lawrence Welk's and Myron Floren's "24 Greatest Polkas" is one of many albums that is unlikely to ever be bought.
New albums sit in proud stacks
close to the registers. Records by
Whitney Houston, Bruce Springsteen
and other artists riding current waves
of popularity are in stacks and stacks:
music by bulk, an earful for everyone,
a single song worth a million bucks,
reprintings and new shipments and
more millions.
But not all is glitter and gold and
platinum. What about the forgotten
names and titles that lay sandwiched
and bound together by old sticky cel
lophane? What about the ones that
wouldn't, didn't or can't sell — not
the gold and platinum of the music in
dustry, but the rust.
The unsellables would make a very
long list. The following is a condensa
tion of that list, the record store rust,
to a quantity that one can hopefully
stomach in a single reading . No con
sensus, collaboration or cooperation
led to the compilation of this list. It
was drawn by a committee of one,
which echoes its inevitable incon
clusiveness and will result in the
equally inevitable disagreement and
disappointment of other individual
committees.
1. Engelbert Humperdinck — Last
of the Romantics Store Price: $3.99
The name alone, which probably
took days, maybe weeks, to
brainstorm, seems absurd enough.
But his album titles sail over the peak
of absurdity, reasserting whatever
was asserted when a mind decided to
name itself Engelbert Humperdinck.
"The Ultimate Engelbert Humper
dinck" and "Miracles by Engelert
Humperdinck" helped the dreamy
eyed swooner settle into a special
place in all of our mushy hearts.
A look at the cover of his 1978
release "Last of the Romantics" will

immediately reveal Humperdinck at
his absurd best, more miraculous than
"Miracles" and surpassing "The Ul
timate."
Picture our hero of love in some
lucky woman's arms, staring so
deeply into her eyes that it looks as if
he is either going to kiss her entire
soul or bite her head off.
Like the rest of Humperdinck's of
ferings, this album features the best
songs written by other artists. Per
haps they let him record them for a
joke. "I'wonder what he'll do to this
one?" they might ask. The rust thick
ens.
2.Jim Nabors Sings The Lord's
Prayers and other sacred songs No
price tag (free?)
Well, maybe we should be glad he
k not reading from the New Testa

ment. "He was as dead as a runover
skunk, but then they went to check
him, and the rock had moved, and
SURPRISE! SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!. .
Aside from the classics, like " Rock
of Ages" and "Battle Hymn of the
Republic," Gomer's affectionate bass
guides us through "Just A Closer
Walk With Thee," "Holy Holy
Holy," and"The Old Rugged Cross."
There are others, rest assured. The
album is a condensed version of
Nabors* opus tribute to his favorite
religion, the double-album "How
Great Thou Art," and it has no
recording date printed on it, which
reflects the timelessness of the faith
itself. Of course, someone like Bing
Crosby probably has an album with a
similar song list, which if played,
would not topple furniture and

torture the sensitive ears of neighbor
hood dogs.
3. Blossom Dearie — May I Come
In? Store Price: $3.99
The cover photo of red-lipped
Blossom Dearie — with her platinum
hair neatly tucked into her snug black
fur coat — when considered with the
album's engaging question-title,
makes this 1964 release a record ex
ecutive's marketing dream. Twenty
two years of store-life later, Blossom
still asks her question.
The text on the back of the album
reads, "No belter she. No leather
lunged strident-voiced seller of songs
is Blossom Dearie. Here is the light
polite voice, the caress with a kick in
it, ingenuous but hip. And she doesn't
sell, she gives it away."
Without inquiring into what it is

that Dearie actually gives away, for
that is open to interpretation and
might only be answered by her or by a
listen to this unpurchasable album,
one might be able to conclude from
the quote that this woman is able to
sing.
The text continues, "This is Blos
som's first album for Capitol. Dearie
fans will rejoice."
No fan club address was listed,
however, and no explanation of the
origin of her name was given. Layers
of rust have formed over such un
