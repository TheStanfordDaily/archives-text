Joe Jackson: "Big World"
After all, what s hamburger?
Chopped ham?"
After all, what s hamburger?
Chopped ham?"
"After all, what's hamburger?"
Nothings worse than a former new
wave star who wants everyone to con
sider his music "serious." Even Sting,
reggae-pop philosopher extraor
dinaire, remembers his "Roxanne"
days. Not so with Joe Jackson, who
sported a fish in his inside trenchcoat
pocket early on in his career. Six
years later he's yelling at his
audiences to keep quiet and putting
the lyrics of his latest album in six lan
guages. C'mon, dude, mellow.
"Big World is Joe's most preten
tious workertv. It's three, yep, three
sides of djrect-to-two-track digital
"live" recordings (remember, the au
dience has to stay quiet, even if they
really have to cough), the production
dynamics of which were assumed im
portant enough to take up three

paragraphs of explanation (in six lan
guages, of course). No such luck. The
sound quality is good, but way too
uniform; every song sounds like every
other.
Joe's journey from fun, spastic
dance-wave through jazz-flirtation to
sophisticated limo-pop has gone too
far this time. Past albums, even
1984's "Body and Soul," had their
happy moments. But "Big World,"
tor all its self-hype and grandeur,
hasn't got enough real songs to till
one side, much less three. Call it Big
Ego — and call Joe the N. Y.C. equiv
alent of David Lee Roth.
If Joe can scrounge up enough past

fans to find a single amidst all 80-or
so minutes of this mush, more power
(and income ) to him. If not, he'll yell
at us all the more next time he tours.
After all, Joe knows what's good for
us poor MTV-drowned Durannies,
doesn't he?
Book of Love: "Book of Love"
"We need more Calgon!" "Ancient
Chinese secret, huh ?"
"We need more Calgon!" "Ancient
Chinese secret, huh?"
"We need more Calgon!" "Ancient
Chinese secret,- huh?"
"We need more Calgon!"
From the pop fringes of England's
fashion-wave department come new
cuties Book of Love, whose peppy
style and glamorous wardrobe are
sure to turn sounds into pounds. And,
oh, what sounds they are! Uni
dimensional melodies, smarmy
synths, bored vocals a hi Deborah
Harry, and silly'n'shallow lyrics — it's
all here, all the stuff you love in
British Re-Invasion Technopop.
But don't get the wrong idea. All
this stuff is goodl (Ain't modern
music twisted?) And even worse (and
therefore terrific) is the attitude of

undaunted cheeriness that each and
every song takes. It doesn't matter if
you've been cheated on, lied to,
stomped on, or even been refused all
those credit cards that were sup
posedly reserved in your name this
spring; in Book of Love's world,
there's simply nothing wrong. No
wars, no starvation, no poverty. Just
L-U-V and romance and all those
other nice things. There's more es
capism on one side of this record than
in a whole quarter of Sunday Flicks.
And besides, there's all this cool art
and "wacky lettering" on the album
cover and sleeve. Man, how could
you not love the Book o' Love? They
have nifty songs about, well, love.
And we here at the Love, Peace, Har
mony and Disarmament Bureau of
KZSU Picks happen to be very fond
of love. So there.
Julian Lennon: "The Secret Value of
Daydreaming"
"You know, you're soaking in it."
"You know, you're soaking in it."
Julian Lennon has been a rock
press-darling ever since he came out
of his self-imposed Hollywood exile
with "Valotte," last year's debut.

He's constantly photographed at par
ties and modeling designer fashions
and doing cute things with/to Other
Famous People. With luck, he may
even appear in Jeanne Dixon's 1987
psychic predictions.
But Lennon's high visibility has
one, and only one, cause, and we all
know what that is. That he doesn't
have much else going for him is a
shame; he has a one-in-a-million
voice and a long-term contract
and he knows the phone numbers of
the innerest of circles of producers
and session musicians. Julian has
everything going for him, except for
the songs he sings. His voice is great.

his musicians are godlike and his
producer (Phil Ramone) could make
the Buzzeocks Top-40-compatible.
So why do the record reviewers
keep cutting him down? Out of
jealousy? Cynicism? Boredom? A
need to preserve reader attention at
all costs?
No, no, no, no. Lennon's problem
is his refusal to write songs that are
interesting. Sure, a couple are
worthy, especially the rockin' "Stick
Around." But after those, all the
other songs run together into some
kind of extended-Chicago-remix
nightmare. It's all so sappy and adult
contemporary that it makes ya down
right nervous. You want him to
scream or yell for Yoko or do some
thing else new and interesting, or
even old and interesting, like his dad
used to do.
So it's not because we don't like
Julian. He's probably a very nice boy.
And he has The Voice, and the con
nections, too. He's just not the kind
of guy who you want cutting albums.
Maybe "Miami Vice" can give him
a guest appearance and get him into
acting. . . .
