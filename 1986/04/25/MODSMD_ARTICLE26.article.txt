The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
Vittorio De Sica's fable about a
man driven to stealing in the
poverty-stricken Rome of the post-
World War II epoch appears on
every list of all-time great movies.
Like the two other neo-realist mas
terpieces De Sica made with
screenwriter Cesare Zavattini,
"Shoeshine" and "Umberto D,'' this
movie touches one so intimately that
it is almost an invasion of privacy; it
is shocking, shattering and finally
exhilarating. De Sica takes us to the
deepest reaches of despair and out
the other side.
Plays tonight with "Forbidden
Games."
Rocky IV (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Sylvestor Stallone's penchant for
psycho-patriotic narcissism gets an
other airing in this, the fourth of the
Rocky series, and by far the most
mindless. The story has Rocky going
up against an ultra-blond Russian
behemoth — a Frankenstein's mon
ster of sports science — to single
handedly recapture American
dignity and pride. Rocky is no longer
just another boxer, or even a human
being; he's a messiah/savior in red,
white and blue boxing trunks. He
represents both the American
people and, curiously enough, the
oppressed Russian peasant class as
well (the political iconography is

more than a little skewed). The
movie is really nothing more than a
series of hyped-up rock videos, and
the pounding fists, pounding
soundtrack and jangly camera work
induce a kind of nausea that some
people mistake for excitement. The
final fight scene is one of the most
startling, revolting displays of self
martyrdom ever put on screen.
Plays this Sunday.
The Year of Living Dangerously
(1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in the
last gasps of President Sukarno's
regime, Peter Weir's film is richly,
vividly enjoyable — it has a sen
suousness that was missing from his
last picture, "Gallipoli" — and
Linda Hunt's amazing portrayal of
Billy Kwan, a Chinese-American
photographer, gives it an emotional
center. Without her, it wouldn't
have one. Weir has made a
cinematic guess at what a Conrad
novel might be like without philoso
phy, without conviction; it's as if he
had assimilated all the old movies
he'd ever seen with daring journalist
heroes and seething revolutions and
feverish romances in unlikely set
tings and compressed them into one
super-deluxe entertainment. What
he has added is his own seductive
elusiveness — his suggestion that
there is more inside his movie than
meets the eye, when in fact there is a

great deal less. It's a hell of a movie,
though.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Witness."
The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This new-wave comic strip ad
venture, with its parodic echoes of
"M*A*S*H" and "Annie Hall" and
the whole catalog of Hollywood sci
fi pictures from the 19505, is consis
tently funny, despite the plot
confusion and the unsuccessful ef
forts of first-time-out director W. D.
Richter to balance several dozen
narrative and character elements.
The story plunks the Japanese-
American cosmic cool leading man
Buckaroo (Peter Weller, of the
electric blue eyes) and his gang, the
Hong Kong Cavaliers (scientists,
rock 'n' rollers and comic book su
perheroes), in the middle of a war
between the Black Lectroids and the
Red Lectroids. As evil Dr. Lizardo,
John Lithgow sends up all the mad
scientists who ever appeared on
screen. Some of the other talented
performers (Ellen Barkin, Jeff
Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd,
Lewis Smith) get buried under piles
of narrative debris, but Richter's all
systems-go direction demonstrates
an appreciation of screenwriter Earl
Mac Rauch's invention, and he col
laborates with production designer
J. Michael Riva, costume designer

Aggie Guerrard Rodgers and special
visual effects supervisor Michael
Fink, as well as the usually unyield
ing photographer Fred
Koenonkamp, to bring off some
nifty pop sequences!
Plays Thursday with "Repo
Man."
Brazil (1985)
Stanford Theatre, Palo Alto
Terry Gilliam's almost-unreleased
comedy is a visually astounding,
slapstick monstrosity. Set in an un
specified totalitarian future, the
movie follows Ministry of Informa
tion toady Sam Lowry (Jonathon
Pryce) in his quasi-revolt against the
behemoth bureaucracy he works for.
The movie is constructed around
overblown sight gags and conceptual
jokes in the spirit and style of Gil
liam's Monty Python animation, but
what makes it all special is Gilliam's
prodigious, brilliant visual imagina
tion. His future world is Art Deco
decay on a grand scale, inspired by
heavy metal sci-fi, 1940s cartoon
surrealism, "Metropolis/' "Blade
Runner" and other influences. The
comedy is large-scale and
dehumanized, much like Spielberg's
"1941," but a few performers —
notably Robert DeNiro, lan Holm
and Katherine Helmond — make an
impression. Gilliam co-authored the
screenplay, with Harold Pinter and
Charles McKeown.
Plays this week.
