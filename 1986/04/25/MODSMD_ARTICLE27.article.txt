## Stanford women successful despite inconveniences 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
OJAI — The timing was all
fouled up for juniors Patty Fen
dick and Leigh Anne Eldredge
yesterday, but the Stanford pair
still advanced to the third round of
the Women's Intercollegiate
Singles here at the Ojai Intercol
legiate.
The Cardinal met with a mixed
fate in the Women's Invitational
College Singles, as freshman
Marianne Werdel won in straight
sets while senior co-captain Susan
Ross lost her opening-round
match.
Fendick, who woke up to a
pitcher of coffee at 6 a.m., mut
tered about having to play her
opening match at 7:30 a.m. at the
Pierpont Racquet Club.
Her complaints seemed un
necessary, however, after she
breezed by Mary Ann Hodges of
Cal State-Bakersfield 6-0 in the
first Set.
Fendick's plan of finishing off
Hodges quickly so that she could
sleep away the rest of the morning
was put to rest when Hodges
captured the first three games of
the second set. Whether or not the
coffee was starting to take effect,
Fendick became a nervous wreck
on the court.
She did manage to break back
ta tie the set at 5-5, but Hodges
ahswered by winning the next two
games to send the match to a third
set.
Hodges' hopes of shocking the
talented Fendick were forgotten
quickly as Fendick started to nail
hpr groundstrokes with more con
sistency. Breaking Hodges in the
third and fifth games, the Stanford
All-American took the third set 6-
2.
Today, Fendick will get to sleep
in longer as she plays the Univer
sity of the Pacific's Trina Lee at 9
a.m.
"Everything came out great,''
Stanford Caoch Frank Brennan
said in his typically optimistic
manner. "She (Fendick) got in

three pressurized sets.
"If she would have stayed back,
she probably wouldn't have lost
that set," Brennan added. "We've
really worked on (her net game).
She's going to forget about win
ning and losing and go out and try
it."
Eldredge, the singles champion
here two years ago, was treated
more like a foreigner yesterday.
After waiting and waiting for her
10:30 a.m. match to start, she was
informed that it had been moved
to nearby Cabrillo Junior High
School.
There, Brennan and Eldredge
were greeted by hundreds of
junior high children. But her op
ponent, Jennifer LaChiusa of the
University of San Diego, was
nowhere to be found. "Welcome
to big-time tennis," Brennan
joked.
Back to the Pierpont Racquet
Club went Eldredge, who by this
time was becoming impatient with
the delay. By the time LaChiusa
was located, it was almost noon.
As if making up for lost time,-
Eldredge dominated LaChiusa 6-
2, 6-0, winning the final nine
games of the match. The Cardinal
junior worked the baseline in a
near-perfect fashion, rarely mis
sing a shot.
Today, Eldredge plays UC-
Santa Barbara's Liz Costa at 9
a.m. in third-round action. Costa
defeated Janet Matthews of Menlo
College 6-0, 6-4 yesterday.
While Eldredge was scrambling
around Ventura County looking
for a place to play, Werdel was
winning 6-2, 6-3 over UOP's
Kristi Kern. Originally listed by
Brennan as doubtful to play this
week because of an ear problem,
Werdel played well, but not with
out pain.
"I didn't know what to expect,"
said Werdel, who did not practice
most of the week. "I played pretty
well.
"I have some fluid in my ear. It
might be an ear infection. It hurts
and I can't hear on the court. I hope I
feel better (today)."
The highly touted freshman from
Bakersfield indicated that, if all goes
well, she should win the Invitational
College Singles. "I think it depends
on how I'm feeling and my concentra
tion," Werdel said. "I didn't really
see anyone in the draw I couldn't beat
or shouldn't beat."
Today, she meets probably her
toughest opponent in the tourna
ment, UCLA's Joni Urban, at 10:30
a.m. "She pounds the ball," Werdel
said. "She hits hard and deep."
In the Women's Invitational
Doubles, Stanford's Cari Hagey and
Stephanie Savides crushed a team
from Cal State-Fullerton 6-0, 6-1. "It
was awful, very one-sided," Brennan
said.
Savides and Hagey play in third
round action today. Also competing
in doubles today for the Cardinal are
Ross and Werdel, who play Lee and
Kern in the first round of the
Women's Invitational College
Doubles at 1:30 p.m.

third and fifth games, the Stanford
All-American took the third set 6-
2.
Today, Fendick will get to sleep
in longer as she plays the Univer
sity of the Pacific's Trina Lee at 9
a.m.
"Everything came out great,''
Stanford Caoch Frank Brennan
said in his typically optimistic
manner. "She (Fendick) got in

three pressurized sets.
"If she would have stayed back,
she probably wouldn't have lost
that set," Brennan added. "We've
really worked on (her net game).
She's going to forget about win
ning and losing and go out and try
it."
Eldredge, the singles champion
here two years ago, was treated
more like a foreigner yesterday.
After waiting and waiting for her
10:30 a.m. match to start, she was
informed that it had been moved
to nearby Cabrillo Junior High
School.
There, Brennan and Eldredge
were greeted by hundreds of
junior high children. But her op
ponent, Jennifer LaChiusa of the
University of San Diego, was
nowhere to be found. "Welcome
to big-time tennis," Brennan
joked.
Back to the Pierpont Racquet
Club went Eldredge, who by this
time was becoming impatient with
the delay. By the time LaChiusa
was located, it was almost noon.
As if making up for lost time,-
Eldredge dominated LaChiusa 6-
2, 6-0, winning the final nine
games of the match. The Cardinal
junior worked the baseline in a
near-perfect fashion, rarely mis
sing a shot.
Today, Eldredge plays UC-
Santa Barbara's Liz Costa at 9
a.m. in third-round action. Costa
defeated Janet Matthews of Menlo
College 6-0, 6-4 yesterday.
While Eldredge was scrambling
around Ventura County looking
for a place to play, Werdel was
winning 6-2, 6-3 over UOP's
Kristi Kern. Originally listed by
Brennan as doubtful to play this
week because of an ear problem,
Werdel played well, but not with
out pain.
"I didn't know what to expect,"
said Werdel, who did not practice
most of the week. "I played pretty
well.
"I have some fluid in my ear. It
might be an ear infection. It hurts
and I can't hear on the court. I hope I
feel better (today)."
The highly touted freshman from
Bakersfield indicated that, if all goes
well, she should win the Invitational
College Singles. "I think it depends
on how I'm feeling and my concentra
tion," Werdel said. "I didn't really
see anyone in the draw I couldn't beat
or shouldn't beat."
Today, she meets probably her
toughest opponent in the tourna
ment, UCLA's Joni Urban, at 10:30
a.m. "She pounds the ball," Werdel
said. "She hits hard and deep."
In the Women's Invitational
Doubles, Stanford's Cari Hagey and
Stephanie Savides crushed a team
from Cal State-Fullerton 6-0, 6-1. "It
was awful, very one-sided," Brennan
said.
Savides and Hagey play in third
round action today. Also competing
in doubles today for the Cardinal are
Ross and Werdel, who play Lee and
Kern in the first round of the
Women's Invitational College
Doubles at 1:30 p.m.
OJAI — The timing was all
fouled up for juniors Patty Fen
dick and Leigh Anne Eldredge
yesterday, but the Stanford pair
still advanced to the third round of
the Women's Intercollegiate
Singles here at the Ojai Intercol
legiate.
The Cardinal met with a mixed
fate in the Women's Invitational
College Singles, as freshman
Marianne Werdel won in straight
sets while senior co-captain Susan
Ross lost her opening-round
match.
Fendick, who woke up to a
pitcher of coffee at 6 a.m., mut
tered about having to play her
opening match at 7:30 a.m. at the
Pierpont Racquet Club.
Her complaints seemed un
necessary, however, after she
breezed by Mary Ann Hodges of
Cal State-Bakersfield 6-0 in the
first Set.
Fendick's plan of finishing off
Hodges quickly so that she could
sleep away the rest of the morning
was put to rest when Hodges
captured the first three games of
the second set. Whether or not the
coffee was starting to take effect,
Fendick became a nervous wreck
on the court.
She did manage to break back
ta tie the set at 5-5, but Hodges
ahswered by winning the next two
games to send the match to a third
set.
Hodges' hopes of shocking the
talented Fendick were forgotten
quickly as Fendick started to nail
hpr groundstrokes with more con
sistency. Breaking Hodges in the
third and fifth games, the Stanford
All-American took the third set 6-
2.
Today, Fendick will get to sleep
in longer as she plays the Univer
sity of the Pacific's Trina Lee at 9
