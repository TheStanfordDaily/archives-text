# Bruins spike Card in regional
## UCLA gets off to 13-1 start to oust Stanford quickly 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — It was a disappointing end to the
1986 season for the Stanford men's volleyball team at
Loyola-Marymount last night as the Cardinal fell to
UCLA 15-3, 15-10, 15-13 in the opening game of the
NCAA West Regional.
UCLA, 15-5 in the California Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association during the regular season, defeated Stan
ford for the third time this year. The first time the Card
inal went down in five games, losing in the fifth by a score
of 15-13. Stanford fell in four later in the season and last
night lost in three.
"I said before the game I'd like to win in three so we
can get some rest," UCLA Coach A 1 Scates said. "It was
just a matter of concentration; we were so fired up the
first game."
Stanford got off to a very slow start, falling behind 13-1
in the opener and ultimately losing 15-3. The Cardinal
had a miserable minus-. 143 hitting percentage in that
game while the Bruins boasted a .404 average.
"We started off passing very poorly," Stanford Co-
Coach Don Shaw said. "We were a little tight. We
couldn't run our offense or get any momentum. UCLA
grabbed it right away."
"They couldn't pass the ball," Scates said. "Our serve
was tough, and Stanford couldn't get its offense going."
"Stanford came out a little nervous," UCLA setter
Andy Klussmann said. "They had some passing problems.
It was tough on their hitters, plus our block was good. It
was a combination of the two — their errors and our
blocking."
UCLA won the second game 15-10, but Stanford took
a 7-0 lead in the third. The Bruins fought back to make it
7-7, then went up 12-8 and then 14-10. Stanford held off
match point, but not long enough, finally losing on a
disputed Jon Root hit that one linesman immediately
ruled was touched by UCLA. The referee, Bob Clark,
overruled the call, awarding UCLA the match.
"The way we played, one call here or there doesn't mat
ter," Shaw said. "The last one was ridiculous. The hardest
part is to end the match on a note like t.iat."
"The last call was like the salt in the wound," Stanford
team captain Brett Monello said. "But it didn't really mat
ter; if it wasn't that one, it would be the next one."
Stanford had been having problems in practice during
the week as well.
"It's always disappointing to lose. 1 kind of expected
it," Monello said. "In practice the last three days we
didn't play well. You need good, tense practices to win."
"There was no way we were going to win this match,"
Root said. "And it showed very much."
Junior Jeff Williams sparked the UCLA attack with 24
kills and a .450 hitting percentage. Asdjorn Bolstad
totalled 14 kills and a .423 average, while Klussmann col
lected 13 kills. UCLA hit .348 as a team.
"Williams was outstanding for us," Scates said. "And
Bolstad had a great all-around game. We've been playing
steady the last two weeks; we're playing at a much higher

level than three weeks ago. We're not
a great hitting team, but we can block
and dig. It's harder on the other
team's offense."
"Jeff played steady and Ozzie
(Bolstad) was also good. Those two
were unstoppable," Klussmann said.
"We took advantage of weak blocks
and sided out well. Then we just
played steady. We're a bigger team,
and we took advantage of that."
"As always, Ozzie played well,"
Monello said. "Williams was steady.
He has a tough serve."
"Everybody played well for
UCLA," Shaw said. "It was a real
good team effort. They got a lot of
digs, one-armed digs, and got their
hands on a lot of power hits, then
came back with a real strong transi
tion attack. They never gave us a
chance to come back. UCLA is a
good team, not a great team — it was
more a case of us beating ourselves
right from the start."
Root was the top hitter for Stan
ford with 17 kills. Scott Fortune fol
lowed with 11 kills and a team-high

.409 hitting percentage.
"Dan (Parr) and Brett (Monello)
came off the bench and did a great
job," Shaw said. "They gave us a lot
of spirit, a lot of effort, and really
helped us out with some scrambling
plays. You could see the difference in
the score when they were in there.
Scott Fortune played well. He had a
couple of errors, but he's a steady
player."
"Root played better than last time
we played Stanford," Klussmann
said. "To me, he's the only one who
did anything."
"There is nobody in the league that
can play the role that Jon Root plays
for us," Monello said. "He's going to
go far in volleyball. He tried real
hard, but he was up against too tough
a task."
"The most consistent team is going
to win," Shaw said. "In the begin
ning, when things aren't going well,
you have to seize the opportunity or
you'll never get out of the hole you
dig for yourself."
Root probably spoke for most of
the graduating seniors when he said,
"I didn't want to go out this way."

the week as well.
"It's always disappointing to lose. 1 kind of expected
it," Monello said. "In practice the last three days we
didn't play well. You need good, tense practices to win."
"There was no way we were going to win this match,"
Root said. "And it showed very much."

team's offense."
"Jeff played steady and Ozzie
(Bolstad) was also good. Those two
were unstoppable," Klussmann said.
"We took advantage of weak blocks
and sided out well. Then we just
played steady. We're a bigger team,
and we took advantage of that."
"As always, Ozzie played well,"
Monello said. "Williams was steady.
He has a tough serve."
"Everybody played well for
UCLA," Shaw said. "It was a real
good team effort. They got a lot of
digs, one-armed digs, and got their
hands on a lot of power hits, then
came back with a real strong transi
tion attack. They never gave us a
chance to come back. UCLA is a
good team, not a great team — it was
more a case of us beating ourselves
right from the start."
Root was the top hitter for Stan
ford with 17 kills. Scott Fortune fol
lowed with 11 kills and a team-high

.409 hitting percentage.
"Dan (Parr) and Brett (Monello)

job," Shaw said. "They gave us a lot
of spirit, a lot of effort, and really
helped us out with some scrambling
plays. You could see the difference in
the score when they were in there.
Scott Fortune played well. He had a

"Root played better than last time
we played Stanford," Klussmann
said. "To me, he's the only one who

"There is nobody in the league that
can play the role that Jon Root plays
for us," Monello said. "He's going to
go far in volleyball. He tried real
hard, but he was up against too tough
a task."
"The most consistent team is going
to win," Shaw said. "In the begin
ning, when things aren't going well,
you have to seize the opportunity or
you'll never get out of the hole you
dig for yourself."

LOS ANGELES — It was a disappointing end to the
1986 season for the Stanford men's volleyball team at
Loyola-Marymount last night as the Cardinal fell to
UCLA 15-3, 15-10, 15-13 in the opening game of the
NCAA West Regional.
UCLA, 15-5 in the California Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association during the regular season, defeated Stan
ford for the third time this year. The first time the Card
inal went down in five games, losing in the fifth by a score
of 15-13. Stanford fell in four later in the season and last
night lost in three.
"I said before the game I'd like to win in three so we
can get some rest," UCLA Coach A 1 Scates said. "It was
just a matter of concentration; we were so fired up the
first game."
Stanford got off to a very slow start, falling behind 13-1
in the opener and ultimately losing 15-3. The Cardinal
had a miserable minus-. 143 hitting percentage in that
game while the Bruins boasted a .404 average.
"We started off passing very poorly," Stanford Co-
Coach Don Shaw said. "We were a little tight. We
couldn't run our offense or get any momentum. UCLA
grabbed it right away."
"They couldn't pass the ball," Scates said. "Our serve
was tough, and Stanford couldn't get its offense going."
"Stanford came out a little nervous," UCLA setter
Andy Klussmann said. "They had some passing problems.
It was tough on their hitters, plus our block was good. It
was a combination of the two — their errors and our
blocking."
UCLA won the second game 15-10, but Stanford took
a 7-0 lead in the third. The Bruins fought back to make it
7-7, then went up 12-8 and then 14-10. Stanford held off
match point, but not long enough, finally losing on a
disputed Jon Root hit that one linesman immediately
ruled was touched by UCLA. The referee, Bob Clark,
overruled the call, awarding UCLA the match.
"The way we played, one call here or there doesn't mat
ter," Shaw said. "The last one was ridiculous. The hardest
part is to end the match on a note like t.iat."
"The last call was like the salt in the wound," Stanford
team captain Brett Monello said. "But it didn't really mat
ter; if it wasn't that one, it would be the next one."
Stanford had been having problems in practice during
the week as well.
"It's always disappointing to lose. 1 kind of expected
