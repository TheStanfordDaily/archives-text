# No more easy 3 at USC
## Trojans no longer a Six-Pac pushover 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
It wasn't so long ago that Stanford's baseball team
looked forward to a series with USC. It was a time of rest,
a departure from the usual rigors of play in the Pacific 10
Conference's Southern Division.
Last year, all Stanford players had to do was roll out of
bed, stick a wad of chewing tobacco in one cheek and say
"Boo!" That was enough to send the lowly Trojans run
ning for cover.
Stanford, on its way to capturing the Six-Pac title by a
full six games, took five of six contests from USC, which
finished in the league's cellar. And they won the games in
style, outscoring the Trojans 83-30 on the year.
Today, the Cardinal begins a three-game weekend se

The set resumes tomorrow at 7 p.m. and concludes Sun
day at 1 p.m.
At first glance, not much has changed from a year ago.
Stanford, 14-7 in league, is once again atop the Six-Pac's
standings, one game ahead of UCLA. And where is USC

(9-15) but near the bottom, in fifth place, 6-1/2 back.
But to listen to Mark Marquess, Stanford's skipper now
in his 10th year with the Cardinal, this is a whole new bal
lgame.
"Unlike past years, we can't approach the USC series as
a chance to fatten up." Marquess said. "With this year's
(Stanford) team, we just can't afford to do that."
The teams have met three times already this year, and
although Stanford managed two wins, the series, played at
Sunken Diamond in late March, was a dogfight. Stan
ford's Jack McDowell and USC's Brad Brink traded
shutouts in the first two games: the Cardinal escaped with
a win in Sunday's finale when Toi Cook scored from
second on a two-out infield hit in the bottom of the ninth
inning.
"That series shows what what we've known all along,"
Marquess said, "that we can't take anybody lightly. If
we're not at the very top of our game, anybody can beat
us."
After last week's busy schedule â€” which saw the Card-

Although John Ramos may be slowed down this weekend by a bruised left ankle, Stanford will be looking to
continue its chase of the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division title this weekend when it travels south for a
three-game series with USC. The Cardinal currently leads the Six-Pac by one game over UCLA.
