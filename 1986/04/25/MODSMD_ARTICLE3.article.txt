# Weekend pizza incident sparks inquiry

### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
An incident at a Theta Delta Chi Rush function
Saturday night involving a Domino's Pizza
deliverywoman has prompted an informal inquiry
by a University official.
According to Domino's Palo Alto Manager
Bruce Carr, the incident took place between 10 and
10:30 p.m. when the woman approached the fra
ternity house to deliver pizzas that had been or
dered by someone at the fraternity. Carr asked that
the woman not be named.
"There were lots of people in the parking lot who
had spilled over from a party in the building," ac
cording to Carr. He said the people in the parking
lot. most if not all of whom were men, "chased (the
deliverywoman] back into her car and gave her a
little bit of verbal abuse."
Carr said the deliverywoman heard the men yel

ling something about rape while they phased her,
but Theta Delt President Jim Flanigon said the
men yelled, "Let's rape the pizzas."
Carr concurred that the word "rape" was used
"in conjunction with the idea of 'Let's get the
pizza.' " He said that the terminology is "entirely
realistic in that situation."
According to Paloma Resident Assistant Bob
Barcklay, the deliverywoman drove to a phone
booth near the Florence Moore dorm, where he
found her trying to talk to the people who had or
dered the pizza. Barcklay said the woman told the
person on the phone, "I can't come deliver your
pizza," because people in the parking lot had
chased her.
Barcklay said when he approached the woman to
help her, she "broke down crying" and was "really
upset." Barcklay then asked freshman Isaac
Barchas to drive with her to the Theta Delt house
to deliver the pizza. The second delivery occured

with no further incidents.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said that
while he has contacted Theta Delt fraternity mem
bers, he is "still trying to reach the Paloma RA and
find out who the woman is who delivered the
pizza" so he can gather more facts about the inci
dent. However, he said, "My sense is there may
have been others outside the fraternity involved,
but there were probably also some fraternity mem
bers who were involved."
Pisano also said the fraternity members' possible
involvement "doesn't make the woman's trauma
any less," and that he "can understand why the
woman was terrified."
Calling it a "deplorable, detestable expression,"
Pisano strongly criticized the alleged yelling of
"Let's rape the pizza" by those involved. "The idea
of that kind of language at Stanford is incompre-
