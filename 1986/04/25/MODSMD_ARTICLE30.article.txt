### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
OJAI — Junior Scott Moody
joined teammate Patrick McEnroe
in the quarterfinals of the Pacific 10
Conference's men's singles tourna
ment by upsetting highly ranked
Steve DeVries of California 1-6, 7-
6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5) here at the Lib
bey Park tennis courts.
"It's my biggest college win by
far," said Moody, who earlier in the
day defeated USC's John Washer
3-6, 6-4, 6-0 in first-round action.
DeVries, ranked No. 1 in singles
at the start of the season, has been
slowed by a wrist injury lately, but
the Cal standout came out hitting
bombs yesterday, breaking Moody
twice at the outset to take a 4-0
lead in the first set.
"I knew he'd been hurt, but he
came out smoking," Moody said.
DeVries finished off the first set
6-1, and when he broke Moody in
the eighth game of the second set to
take a 5-3 lead, the match appeared
to be over.
But Moody broke back as
DeVries was serving for the match,
and the two held serve into the tie
breaker.
The high-wire act continued for
Moody as he fell behind 6-4 in the
tie-breaker.
Moody didn't panic. "I was just
trying to get to the net," he said
after the match.
The net game that he employed
so well throughout the match
clicked for Moody in this crucial sit
uation — he rallied to score the
next four points and grab the tie
breaker, 8-6.
The third set followed the lead of
the first two, as DeVries routinely
broke Moody's serve to take a 5-2
lead. But Moody went to the well
one last time and struck oil, break
ing DeVries twice to send the
match to a final tie-breaker.
Running DeVries from side to
side, Moody quickly gained a 4-0
lead, which he never relinquished.
Trailing 6-5, DeVries slammed a
Moody serve into the net and then
slammed his racket on the court in
frustration.
"That right there was my best
tennis," Moody said.

Today at 9 a.m., Moody plays
USC's John Carras in the quarter
finals.
McEnroc. recipient of a bye in
the morning first round, earned a
rematch with USC's Luke Jensen
by disposing of Cal's Forrest Hunt
6-3, 2-6, 6-2 in an afternoon
match.
McEnroe and Jensen, at one time
the top-ranked junior doubles team
in the world, meet at 9 a.m. today.

Last Friday, Jensen heat McEnroe
6-3, 6-4 in Los Angeles.
"I could have played with a little
better concentration," McEnroe
said of his victory over Hunt yester
day. "In the second set. I thought 1
fell asleep."
McEnroe will have to be awake
today to beat Jensen, the sensa
tional freshman who has shocked
the collegiate tennis world this year
