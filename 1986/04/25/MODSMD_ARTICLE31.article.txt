# NCAA tune-ups for golfers
## Injury-plagued women visit Tucson for Pac-West tourney 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
While calling the Pacific West Conference
Championship a tune-up for the Stanford
women's golf team might seem to be bragging,
that is almost exactly what the tournament will
be.
The seventh-ranked Cardinal would have to
take quite a pratfall in Tucson, Ariz., this
weekend to miss out on the 14-team NCAA
Championship in Columbus, Ohio, next month.
The 54-hole tournament, hosted by Arizona,
features four of the nation's top 10 teams, so
even if Stanford were to leave Sunday on the bot
tom of the leader board, chances are still excel
lent that it would be invited to nationals.
And that's just fine with Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin, who will be without the services of
Kathleen McCarthy and Clare Dolan when the
teams tee off today at the Tucson National Golf
Course.

Dolan has not played since the Oklahoma
State Intercollegiate in Guadalajara, Mexico, last
January. She continues to be plagued by ten
dinitis of the left wrist. And McCarthy, who suf
fered a muscle injury in her back last week at the
Lady Sun Devil in Phoenix, now has contracted
chicken pox. She will be in quarantine during the
Pac-West.
Don't underestimate the Cardinal's chances,
however. The squad it brings down to Tucson will
still be a competitive one. led by the team's hot
test player, Kay Cornelius. Coming off an even
par final round at the California Intercollegiate
April 7, Cornelius went on to fire rounds of 77,
76 and 75 to lead the Stanford individuals at the
Lady Sun Devil.
Playing second for Stanford is Julie Carmic
hael, who has been perhaps the Cardinal's
steadiest player this year. Carmichael finished
fifth among all individuals at the California, then
overcame a sluggish start to finish at 233 at the
Lady Sun Devil.

Kathy Kostas finished second on the team both
at the Lady Sun Devil and the California. Kostas,
a senior from Palmdale, shot even-par lor 36
holes on the last day of the California. She is
seeded third for Stanford.
Adrienne Gilmartin and Trish McGonigle will
round out the Cardinal lineup.
Fifth-ranked Arizona State heads the other
four teams in the Pac-West. which will expand to
include all the Pac-10 teams next year. Ninth
ranked UCLA, 10th-ranked USC and Arizona
make up the rest of the field.
"It's going to be a pretty good mixup down
there." Baldwin said.
The last time these teams met in Tucson (on a
different course) was for the Arizona Intercol
legiate. ASU won, with USC second, Arizona
third and UCLA fourth. Stanford was a disap
pointing eighth.
But that doesn't daunt Baldwin.
"We're going to win that mother," he
predicted.
