# Men looking to break long BYU string at Cougar Classic
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
What can one say about going to
a tournament in which the host
school has not lost since most of the
participants were in pre-school?
If you're Tim Schaaf, coach of the
Stanford men's golf team, you call it
a "challenge" and just let your team
give it its best shot.
The challenge that the Cardinal
faces is knocking off Brigham
Young in the Cougar Classic this
weekend at the Riverside Country
Club in Provo, Utah.
"BYU hasn't lost the tournament
in . . . certainly 15 years," Schaaf

said. "They are a top team."
Besides Brigham Young, Stan
ford, the fourth-ranked team in the
West, will be competing against
New Mexico and Weber State, two
other fine squads.
The Cardinal is coming off a
fourth-place finish in its last tourna
ment, the U.S. Intercollegiate
here. Last fall, the Cardinal fell
to eighth in the Robertson Holmes
Intercollegiate immediately after a
victoiy at home in the Stanford Fall
Intercollegiate. However, this time
Stanford has had a 12-day cushion
between tournaments and should be
at full strength for the Cougar Clas
sic.

It will be interesting to see how
Roger Miraglia fares in Provo.
Miraglia, a freshman from Laguna
Niguel, has, according to Schaaf,
"made more improvements in four
months than any golfer since I've
been here." He finished 10th in the
U.S. Intercollegiate, leading Stan
ford's golfers with an I I-over-par
224.
The rest of Stanford's team is
itKide up of Carl Wagner, Don
Walsworth, John Dickey, Rich
Marik and Phil Rowley.
Walsworth shot a 228 at Stanford
while Wagner wits right behind him
at 229. Dickey, returning to the
starting lineup after a long absence,

had the team's best individual
round, an even-par 71, on his vyay
to a 231.
Marik had a pair of 76s but a
round of S3 in between to end up at
235, while Rowley ended up at 238.
One of Schaaf s worries about the
team earlier this year was that he
wasn't sure the players were
"tournament tough." That fear may
have been assuaged at the U.S. In
tercollegiate.
"1 was very, very pleased .with
how we played," Schaaf said, refer
ring to the squad's comeback
ninth place to fourth in one day.Vlt
would have been really easy to
finish seventh or eighth."
