# Reduced Cardinal track to compete at Mt. Sac
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
While most of their teammates will be at home this
weekend, the Stanford distance medley and a handful
of throwers will be representing the Cardinal at this
year's Mt. Sac Relays in Walnut.
The event is one of the country's biggest outdoor
meets, and accordingly, Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson usually takes a full slate of athletes.
This year, however, Johnson decided to hold back.
A dual meet with California and the conference cham
pionships are just around the corner, and Johnson is
looking ahead.
"It's time to get ready for Cal. Those who need to
get rested are getting rested, and those who need to
train are training," Johnson said.
"It's great to be able to do all that stuff without a lot
of competition. We're in a position to improve at the
conference meet, and I don't want to blow that with
too much work in the interim," he said.
Of the athletes that will compete this weekend, the

shotputters, Pam Dukes and Patty Purpur, look like
the ones to watch.
According to Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wollman,
the pair has had a "great week of practice," and could
be ready for some personal records. Both have already
qualified for the NCAA Championships.
Dukes is currently ninth on the all-time collegiate
list. Her season goal is to break the Stanford school
record held by Carol Cady. Cady, along with most of
the country's best throwers, will be competing
alongside Dukes and Purpur at Mt. Sac.
Other Stanford athletes entered in the meet are
Steve Schadler, Jeff Atkinson, Brian Connoly and
Christian Skoog, who make up the team's undefeated
distance medley: Denise Gaztambide, Dave Pickett
and Fred Mondragon in the javelin; Karen Nickerson
and Glenn Schneider in the discus: and Brian Buss in
the hammer.
Gaztambide, a multi-purpose athlete, will also enter
the high jump. Pickett will perform double duty as
well. He will be joined by John Gash in the pole vault.
