Duchess of Windsor dies at age 89
WASHINGTON — The Duchess of Windsor, the coolly elegant
American divorcee for whom King Edward VIII gave up the British
throne, launching a love story that became one of the enduring legends
of the 20th century, died yesterday at her home in Paris. She was 89.
Her death was announced in London by Buckingham Palace. Sources
said she died of bronchial pneumonia.
On June 3, 1937, at the Chateau de Cande in the Loire Valley in
France, His Royal Highness Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor, and Mrs.
Simpson, the former Bessiewallis Warfield of Baltimore, were married.
So great was the interest in the duke and duchess that they became one
of the most exhaustively reported stories of modern times — and almost
always they were cast as the principals in a tale of unblemished love.
Khadafy seeks revenge, officials say
WASHINGTON — Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy is "more dan
gerous" now than before the U.S. retaliatory raid against Libya and is
seeking personal revenge against President Reagan, according to a State
Department intelligence analysis, the contents of which became known
yesterday.
When asked about the assessment, which was first reported by ABC
television, department spokesman Charles Redman said that one ac
count — that the president's four children would be prime targets if
Khadafy were to exact retribution in the Arab tradition for the reported
death of an adopted daughter in the Libyan raid — "is something that
I've not seen."
According to an official who spoke on condition that he not be identi
fied, the assessment emphasized the personal character of the revenge
the Libyan leader hopes to achieve. The threat to the Reagan family was
not specified, he said, although the inference could be drawn.
Redman, stressing that no final approval of the report hjis been made,
said that "there are many assessments, many analyses of all kinds of is
sues being made by many experts." He pointed out that Secretary of
State George Shultz had not passed judgment on the report.
At the White House, spokesman Edward Djerejian said that he is un
aware of any added protection for the presidential family since the
Libyan raids. "1 am sure eveiy precaution is being taken," Djerejian
said.
Meanwhile, Shultz yesterday publicly repeated Reagan's warning to
Syria and Iran the day before that they, too, could suffer U.S. retaliation
if they are proved to be sponsors of anti-American terrorism.
CIA officer reportedly tortured
WASHINGTON — Two years ago, Ethiopian security police ab
ducted and tortured a Central Intelligence Agency officer involved in a
CIA covert propaganda campaign against the Marxist government in
Addis Ababa, according to informed sources.
The officer was held captive for more than a month, suffering a
fractured skull, chipped vertebrae and dislocated shoulders during his
captivity. He was freed in February 1984 when then ambassador-at
large Vernon Walters flew secretly to Addis Ab.tba, confronted Ethiop
ian leader Mengistu Haile-Mariam and obtained the officer's release,
the sources said.
According to these sources, the CI A officer was subjected to hours of
terror, including a form of" Russian roulette" played by his captors, and
was denied sleep for five days until he signed a confession stating he
worked for the CIA. He was constantly bound during this period and
was not allowed to shower for 35 days.
The Administration never publicly protested the incident, which U.S.
intelligence officials say is one of the worst attacks by a foreign govern
ment on a CIA officer working as an accredited diplomat. But accounts
of the episode have circulated in the Administration and Congress, con
tributing to the general deterioration of U.S. relations with Ethiopia.
Since 1981, the CIA — under authorization by President Reagan —
has provided about $500,000 a year to support propaganda and resis
tance tactics by an anti-communist group of Ethiopian dissidents, ac
cording to informed sources. In recent months, senior Administration
official* have begun preliminary planning for covert paramilitary train
ing of armed guerrillas committed to overthrowing the current Ethiopian
regime, the sources added, although no decision has been made by the
White House on whether to provide munitions or other lethal aid.
Kohl criticized for SDI support
BONN. West Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has
come under attack from political opponents for leaving West Germany
vulnerable to more severe curbs on high-technology exports to the East
Bloc because of commitments undertaken with the United States in
joining the "Star Wars" research program.
The opposition Social Democrats have warned of grave future damage
to the country's export industries following the release of two confiden
tial pacts in which Bonn accepted tight security restrictions in the ex
change of research findings and promised to toughen laws governing
trade in sensitive goods.
West Germany signed two agreements with the United States last
month that set forth terms of participation for West German companies
in President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative and a "joint under
standing of principles" on technology transfers. The SDI, familiarly
known as "Star Wars," would be an antimissile defense system using
space-based technology.
The twin accords were supposed to remain secret, but last Friday the
Cologne Express newspaper published the complete texts. The Kohl
government expressed its outrage over the leak even though several
members of ruling coalition parties voiced satisfaction that the accords
were made public.
The phrasing of the accords indicates that the U.S. Administration will
retain ultimate control over the use of all results and applications
developed under SDI contracts, even though Kohl stipulated that West
Germany would only participate if guaranteed a fair share of research
findings and that technology benefits would not be confined to "a one
way street" leading to Washington.
In addition, it says the United States will exercise sole authority in de
ciding what kinds of research will be deemed secret and what kinds may
be applied in the civilian sector.
Iran warns against U.S. interference
TEHRAN. Iran — Iran accused the U.S. Navy task force in the Per
sian Gulf yesterday of undertaking provocations against its navy and
warned that it would open fire if the Americans interfered in its ship
searches at the Hormuz Straits.
The warning, made by the commander of the Iranian navy, Malak
Dazjan. came during a Tehran Radio broadcast that accused President
Reagan of threatening to bomb Tehran.
"The Persian Gulf is not the Gulf of Sidra," the broadcast said, refer
ring to the recent U.S.-Libya collision in the Mediterranean. "The
Iranian people are fully ready to confront the imperialist crusade against
Islam."
Iran's daily military communique said that three commercial ships
were intercepted at the Hormuz Straits yesterday and allowed to
proceed after it was determined that they were not carrying any Iraqi
cargo. At least 17 ships and oil tankers yverc intercepted by the Iranians
earlier this week.
Iran's ruling clergy men meanwhile unleashed a verbal fusiladc against
the "Great U.S. Satan" on the eve of today's supposed birthday anniver
sary of Imam al-Mahdi. the Messiah who according to Shiism will be
reincarnated to rule in a world of justice.
