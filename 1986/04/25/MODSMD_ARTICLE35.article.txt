# No fatalities in London bombing

LONDON â€” In Britain's second brush with a
potential major disaster in a week, a bomb ripped
through a British Aiiways ticket office in the heart
of London's Oxford Street shopping area early yes
terday, gutting the office, blowing out windows of
stores hundreds of yards away but, miraculously,
injuring only one person slightly.
Police detectives said that they were investigat
ing the possibility of a Libyan connection, but they
stressed that they had no firm information about
who carried out the attack. No one has claimed re
sponsibility.
Earlier in the week, the British Home Office,
which deals with police and security matters, said
that it had detained 21 Libyans and would expel
them as security threats. Yesterday the office said

that a 22nd Libyan, a student, had been arrested in
Bradford in northern England and would be
deported with those already detained.
The blast in London occurred just before 5 a.m..
a time when the city's premier shopping street was
virtually deserted. One woman standing about 100
yards away was reportedly knocked off her feet by
the blast and was the only person reported injured.
Elderly residents living in apartments above the
ticket office were evacuated, and a fire caused by
the bomb was extinguished after about an hour.
The area was cordoned off for several hours be
cause of glass falling onto sidewalks.
Police officials said that if the bomb had
detonated a few horns later, it most likely would
have caused heavy casualties. They declined com

ment on the size or nature of the explosive in
volved.
The attack on the British Airways office came
exactly one week after a woman passed through all
routine security checks at London s Heathrow Air
port carrying a 10-pound bomb and was minutes
from boarding an El Al jumbo jet when she was
stopped by an alert member of the airline's own se
curity staff. That bomb would almost certainly have
destroyed the aircraft carrying 387 persons.
The blast came amid heightened terrorist alerts
here, generated by concerns about possible Libyan
or other Arab reprisals for Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher's decision to permit American F-
I l I fighter-bombers to launch their raid against
Libya from bases in Britain.
