# Official recommends barring Waldheim
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Depart
ment of Justice unit that investigates
Nazi war criminals has urged that
former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim be banned from entering
this country because of his alleged
participation in Nazi-sponsored per
secutions. government sources said
yesterday.
The recommendation came in the
form of a memorandum from Neal
Sher, head of the department's Office
of Special Investigations, to Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111. urging that
Waldheim be placed on the govern
ment's "watch list" as an alien who is
to be stopped from entering U.S. bor
der, the sources said.
Since Waldheim is a leading candi

date in the May 4 Austrian presiden
tial election, Sher's recommendation
presents the Reagan Administration
with a potentially delicate political di
lemma. If Sher's recommendation is
accepted and Waldhiem is elected,
the United Stales would be in the un
precedented position of barring the
head of state of an allied European
nation from entering this country.
On the other hand, rejecting the
war crimes unit's recommendation —
which seemingly amounts to the first
official finding by U.S. experts that
recent allegations about Waldheim's
past have merit — would risk offend
ing many Jewish Americans and
others who are extremely sensitive to
issues involving former Nazis.

President Reagan first confronted
the depth of that feeling last year
when he received massive criticism
for his decision to visit a German mil
itary cemetery at Bitburg, where
some 30 Nazi SS troops were buried
along with 2,000 other soldiers. At
the forefront of the effort to investi
gate and make public Waldheim's
war record has been the World
Jewish Congress, headquarted in
New York City.
Under federal law, any alien who
was associated with the Nazi govern
ment in Germany during World War
II or with a government controlled or
allied with the Nazis during the war
can be restricted from entering this
country.
