Deaver courted Canada
WASHINGTON — Former deputy chief of
staff Michael Deaver was still working in the
White House when he first talked with Canadian
government officials about signing up Canada as
a client for the Washington lobbying firm he
planned to establish, according to a
knowledgeable Canadian source.
"Yes, I know there were discussions, certainly
before Deaver left the White House," the source
said.
The source said he thinks that the discussions
took place between the March 1985 U.S.-
Canada summit in Quebec City and the May
1985 summit of industrialized nations in Bonn,
West Germany. Deaver left the White House on
May 10. 1985, after the Bonn summit and Presi
dent Reagan's trip to Europe.
William Fox, chief spokesman for Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, said yesterday,
" That is an unsubstantiated allegation," 1 which he
described as "not true."
I ox said that "the veiy first discussion about
this contract" between Deaver and Canada
"occurred on May l(>, 1985," when Canada's
ambassador to the United States, Allan Gotlieb,
approached Deaver.
Asked whether there were any discussions
about Canada retaining Deaver before then, he
said, "My information is no."
Deaver signed a $ 105,000-per -year contract
with Canada on July I to provide advice to
Canadian officials on matters involving the
United States, including acid rain pollution, an
issue that Deaver had been involved in before the
Reagan Mulroney meeting.
EPA testimony probed
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court
panel named Washington attorney James McKay
as an independent counsel yesterday to examine
allegations that former Asst. Attorney General
Theodore Olson gave false testimony to
Congress in 1983 about the Administration's
withholding of Environmental Protection
Agency documents.

But the three-judge panel, following limits set
by Attorney General Edwin Meese 111, did not
ask the independent counsel to investigate two
former deputy attorneys general and others who
were accused of wrongdoing in a 1,300-page
report last December by the House Judiciary
Committee.
" Those charges are not justified," said Olson,
who was the Justice Department's chief legal ad
viser as head of the Office of Legal Counsel until
1984. "There is no credible evidence to support
the proposition that I misled Congress.
"I regret that I have to go through this
process," said Olson, now an attorney here with
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the Los Angeles law
firm of former Attorney General William French
Smith. He said the independent counsel statute
"can work in unpleasant and unfair ways."
Meese sought the probe of Olson after a pre
liminary FBI investigation. But he told the court
there is insufficient evidence to pursue allega
tions against former Deputy Attorney General
Carol Dinkins and former Deputy Attorney
General Edward Schmults, both of whom were
accused in the committee's report of acting im
properly in the EPA controversy.
Reagan off to summit
WASHINGTON — President Reagan leaves
today for the longest overseas trip of his
presidency, a 12-day swing across the Pacific
basin that will culminate a week from now in a
seven-nation summit meeting in Tokyo at which
Libyan-backed terrorism appears likely to over
shadow the economic issues on the formal
agenda.
To ease the impact of jet lag and a grueling 13-
hour time change, Reagan will take a meandering
road to the summit. He will pass through Los An
geles today, pause for a weekend at the beach in
Honolulu and make a brief stopover at Guam
before the first business visit of the trip, a
meeting with the foreign ministers of the Associ
ation of South East Asian Nations in Bali, In
donesia, on May I. He arrives in Tokyo the next
day in preparation for the May 4-6 summit.
Although the Tokyo agenda is packed with
pressing economic issues — involving U.S. trade

problems with Japan and the European Eco
nomic Community, international currency ex
change and the Third World debt — the news at
the 12th economic summit will probably be
dominated by political issues, including Libyan
terrorism and the erratic course of East-West re
lations.
Revenue-sharing killed
WASHINGTON — The Senate reined in its
spending impulses yesterday and rejected a pro
posal to allow room in next year s budget for con
tinuation of revenue-sharing with local govern
ments, which Congress previously voted to kill at
the end of this fiscal year.
Voting 54 to 41. it spurned a proposal from
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) to keep
the popular $4.6 billion-a-year program alive if
the Finance Committee approves the extension
as well as funding for it.
It also rejected, 56 to 40, a proposal from Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) to raise taxes by
$145 million to expand funding for maternal,
child and community health programs.
AT&T to slash rates
American Telephone & Telegraph proposed
the largest rate cut in the company's history yes
terday. asking federal regulators for permission
to slash long-distance charges by $1.5 billion, ef
fective June I.
If the cut is approved by the Federal Commu
nications Commission, the cost of a l()-minute,
business-hours AT&T call between Los Angeles
and New York would drop to $3.91 from $4.43.
A similar call between Los Angeles and Houston
would cost $3.56 instead of $4.07.

gether a small gain yesterday in a drifting session.
