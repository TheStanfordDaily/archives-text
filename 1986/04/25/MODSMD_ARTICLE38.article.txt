I OS ANGELES — The espionage retrial of
former FBI agent Richard Miller was mys
teriously adjourned yesterday just minutes after
convicted Soviet spy Svetlana Ogorodnikova
began testifying about her first meeting with Mil
ler in 14N4. One source said the adjournment
was called because of a "possible conflict" in
volving Ogorodnikova and her lawyers.
Sources said U.S. District Judge David Kenyon
decided to delay the testimony of Ogorodnikova
until tomorrow while he maneuvered behind the
scenes to resolve "some dramatic developments"
related in part to the counseling Ogorodnikova
has received from her lawyers about her tes
timony.
The judge's decision followed a private
meeting with Ogorodnikova and lawyers in
volved in the case in his chambers. During the
meeting. Ogorodnikova was said by one source
to have denied passing secret FBI documents to
the Soviet Union — potential testimony of ob
vious value to Miller's defense.
While lawyers involved in the case have sworn
not to discuss specific details of the problem,
sources said that Kenyon was searching for an
other lawyer to counsel Ogorodnikova on

whether she should retain her current lawyers or
get a new one.
Ogorodnikova's lawyers. Brad Brian and
Gregory Stone, would not comment when asked
if they will continue to represent her.
