# Spring has sprung sweet senioritis

Buzzing over Lake Lag swarm
the June bugs, carriers of the
dreaded disease "senioritis." They
hover, mass together and attack.

The June bug leaves most of the
Stanford student body alone,
pointing its sharp little stinger at
only seniors who have progressed
well into their last year of college.

injecting them with the laziness
venom.
Senioritis soon sets in.
But for others, amidst all the
excitement, there is still uncer
tainty and anxiety about the future
after June.
For those seniors going on to
graduate school, the "real world"
will be postponed for another few
years. Senior Dan Stryer, who will
attend Yale Medical School in the
fall, said that after his notification of accep
tance his attitude towards schoolwork
changed.
"Last week I went six days literally with
out touching my books, and I've never done
that before," Stryer said. "It's great having
more free time. Before I was never able to
take a nap when I wanted to. Now I sleep
more."
For other seniors, graduation marks the
beginning of a new phase in life — the
working world. Senior Anne Trela will start
a job as a strategic planner with the Walt
Disney Company in July. Trela said she is
using the time now to participate in extracur
ricular activities, clubs and voluntary organi
zations. Said Trela, "It's time to see friends
again and be a kid for the last time."
And then there are those seniors whose
futures are still up in the air. Yet, in spite of
this uncertainty, a positive outlook seems to
prevail. Senior Iris Massion is waiting to hear
about an internship with the White House in
Washington, D.C.
"I'm not anxious," Massion said. "I'm
looking forward to leaving. Stanford has
been a great place, but going out and apply
ing myself in the real world is something I
really look forward to."
Massion admitted that there is an element
of anxiety that comes with not having any
thing planned out. "Sometimes I feel like I
should have a full-time job. But other times I
feel that now is the time I should be explor

ing different opportunities because 1 may
never have the opportunity again.
She noted that there's always some risk
taking involved and there's an excitement in
the spontaneity which comes from deciding
what one would like to do with his or her life.
Massion finished her studies last quarter
and is enjoying her unenrolled quarter at
Stanford.
"It's nice to be able to take advantage of
everything Stanford has to offer, particularly
those things which I couldn't attend when 1
had school work," she said.
Massion said she sees this time as a transi
tional phase — she is easing out of school but
still working on a part-time internship in San
Francisco. "It's the best of both worlds," she
said.
Senior Greg Crossfield is also uncertain
about what the future holds in store for him.
Yet Crossfield has a different attitude about
graduation. "The nostalgia isn't that great. I
have no great attachment to Stanford since
I'm from the East Coast."
Crossfield said he does not fear the
prospect of not having employment. "1 feel
real confident that I can get out there and
challenge the world," he said. Crossfield
noted that once out on a given job, Stanford
students are incredibly qualified. "People
don't realize how powerful their bargaining
position is," he said.
Crossfield, unlike other students who are
using this time to wind down and relax, said
he is trying to work harder and do better in
classes. He noted that this is his last chance
to "go out in a blaze of glory."
