# Police investigate small fire
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
A small early morning fire at Roble Hall yesterday
has sparked an investigation by the Stanford police as
well as the concerns of a University official.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. someone lit a flier attached to a resident's
door in hall 3-C, triggering the fire alarm shortly after
2 a.m.
"(The fire) was out when the fire department got
there. . . . Nothing else caught fire." he said.
If the police identify those responsible for the fire,
they will "take the case to the (Santa Clara County)
District Attorney and ask what appropriate charges
should be filed," Herrington said.
Lisa Waltuch, resident assistant in 3-C, said yester
day. "1 do not think that a factual statement can be
made at this time. The facts are not definite at all. That
is why we are hesitant to release any names in connec
tion with the incident."
Herrington expressed concern at reports that due to
the frequency of false fire alarms at Roble, many resi
dents did not take the alarm seriously and remained in
their rooms.
While "it is frustrating to evacuate when there's a

(false) alarm, the time when you don't (evacuate)
could be the time of an actual fire." he said.
Herrington cited the Storey House fire of 1979 in
which a student was nearly killed.
Herrington said the Roble incident was "very dan
gerous because it was in the middle of the night," and
many residents slept through the alarm.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons shared Her
rington's concerns over the incident.
"If it is discovered that somebody deliberately set
fire to anything, at a minimum they would be thrown
out of campus housing immediately, and there's a very
good chance that they would not be a student here any
longer." he said.
" Any action that puts other students in danger can in
no way be seen as a trivial matter," he continued.
"Anytime in the past that something like this has hap
pened, we have regarded it very seriously. It's hard to
understand that there could be anything capable of
mitigating that unacceptable risk of causing harm to
other students."
The flier was posted on the door of sophomore An
nika Olson. She was unavailable for comment yester
day.
The Roble resident fellows were also unavailable for
comment.
