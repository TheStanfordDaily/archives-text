# Hospital needs ICU nurses, officials cite patient increase
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN 
One month after laying off 150
workers. Stanford Hospital is suffer
ing a nursing shortage because of an
unexpected influx of patients.
The lack of nurses is being felt es
pecially in the intensive care units
(ICUs), according to Judy Lanigan,
assistant director of the hospital in
charge of staffing. Nurses have been
rescheduled and are working
overtime to fill gaps, she said.
The hospital is hiring "experienced
ICU nurses as fast as it can," Lanigan
said. Of 30 openings. 20 have yet to
be filled.
"No nurses were laid off (last
month). with the exception of some at
the management level. Most cuts
were made by attrition — leaving
vacated positions unfilled." She said
1 15 of the nursing cuts were accom
plished by attrition.

Some of those who left are pending
rehire, but none have been rehired so
far, Mitchell said. "We have been
contacting them about the
vacancies."
The difficulty in filling positions is
"because many colleges cut their two
year nursing programs about two
years ago, and there doesn't seem to
be the same volume of nurses out
there." said Malinda Mitchell, direc
tor of nursing services.
"ICU nurses are assigned on a
patient-need basis, and we adjust the
number of ICU nurses daily
(according to need)," she said. "One
or two patients are cared for by one
nurse on a 24-hour basis."
During the last two months, the
ICUs have filled IK percent above
what was expected, Lanigan noted,
adding that "over the past eight
weeks there has been a dramatic in
crease."

"No one knows why this is happen
ing." Mitchell said. "We aren't quite
sure why the census has gone up so
unexpectantly."
There has been a slight increase in
the number of trauma patients since
the hospital was declared one of
Santa Clara County's three trauma
centers, she said.
Additionally, "we are doing more
heart and lung transplants, and those
patients usually spend a couple days
in an ICU," Mitchell said.
But these facts do not completely
explain the rise in the number of
patients, she said, noting that other
Peninsula hospitals are also experi
encing an increase.
Since last August, hospital census
figures showed a downward trend in
the number of patients. In response,
the hospital eliminated 400 positions,
including 150 in the nursing depart
ment. she said.
