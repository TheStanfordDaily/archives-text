# State misses physical diseases in mental patients, study says
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
Half of the physical illnesses that
exacerbate mental disorders of
patients of the state's mental health
system go undetected, according to a
recent Stanford Medical School
study.
I he study, mandated by state Sen
ate Bill 929, was performed to
"discover a cost-effective means of
screening those who come to the
public mental health system" for
physical illness and to "determine
whether their symptoms are due to
physical disease or mental disorder,"
according to Dr. Lorrin Koran, psy
chiatry professor at the medical
school and one of the study's prin
cipal investigators.
According to Koran, the inves
tigators hoped to "tell the state how
to set up and conduct screening" pro
cedures.
I he study revealed that "almost
one in two (patients in the state men
tal health system) had an important
active physical disease," according to
Koran, and "of these, the state men
tal health system was unaware of
half."

He said the state was doing a
"reasonably good job on causal
diseases," illnesses that directly cause
a patient's mental disorders.
But the state "wasn't doing such a
good job" identifying illnesses that
exacerbate, or worsen, mental disor
ders, he said.
"This is the first time that any state
mental health system has been
studied in toto to determine the prev
alence of physical disease," Koran
said, adding that "a number of states
. . . have called us about mounting
similar studies in their state mental
health systems."
Currently, screening procedures
cost $45-55 per patient, and "are de
tecting 45 percent of the (physical)
diseases for that expenditure," ac
cording to Koran.
The state could raise the detection
rate to 90 percent if state officials
were willing to accept the study's
proposals, Koran said.
The study recommends a mini
medical exam and an evaluation of
the exam's results according to simple
guidelines set by the team.
Although the proposed program
would cost $85 per patient, it would
be more cost-effective because "you

find more disease per dollar spent,
Koran said.
"But whether there's a net savings
in health care dollars is still an open
question," he said.
Koran said that if the program
were implemented, hopefully more
disease would be detected and
therefore patients would be able to
leave mental health facilities sooner.
Koran also stressed that the $85
amount was the "maximum of what it
would cost," adding that "it would be
less if implemented on a larger scale."
In the study's three-month follow
up period, there were no significant
changes in mental health or medical
care costs, Koran said.
But the three-month time period
was too short to evaluate the pro
gram, he said, suggesting at least a
year-long follow-up.
Koran said that the research team
submitted their study to the state
legislature and Department of Mental
Health and that they are "now con
sidering which of our recommen
dations, if any, they will enact."
The bill, passed in 1981, was spon
sored by state senator Bob
Garamendi from the sth district.
