## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
A former therapist at the
Children's Hospital at Stanford is
suing the hospital, claiming she was
"wrongly dismissed'' for a shooting
incident which took place in her East
Palo Alto home last year.
In a complaint filed last week in
Santa Clara County Superior Court,
Terry Williams, a respiration thera
pist, charged that the hospital dis
regarded her good job performance
and dismissed her in October because
she shot and seriously wounded her
boyfriend during a domestic dispute
in September.
According to Kim Staskus, Wil
liams' attorney, "(The hospital) took
an instance in her personal life that
had no bearing on her job perfor
mance. My understanding is that she
(Williams) had an excellent record
with the Children's Hospital."
"You must understand," he added,
"this was a woman who had been
beaten in a past marriage and had
eveiy reason to believe she would be
beaten again. She acted justifiably in
self-defense."
Williams is seeking unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages
in an amount sufficient to punish the
hospital and make an example of its
conduct, Staskus said.
"In a case like this it is incumbent
upon the employer to give the defen
dant the benefit of the doubt,"
Staskus said.
The Children's Hospital
spokesperson Diarmuid McGuire
said last night the hospital could not
comment on the suit because it in
volved a personnel matter and be
cause the sui' had not been reviewed
by hospital jtorneys.
Times ribune news accounts of
the sh .ng say that Williams
wour ci.1 her boyfriend, Calvin Ken
non, in the stomach with a .38 caliber
revolver on Sept. 3 after they
returned from a fishing trip.
Williams pleaded guilty to the
shooting and was sentenced April 16
to a 60-day work furlough program,
two years probation and an un
specified fine, according to the
Tribune. The hospital inquired about
the incident soon after it occurred
and hospital officials were referred to
the San Mateo's District Attorney's
Office.
Williams' suit charges that she was
suspended without pay immediately
after the shooting and was fired a
month later because the hospital was
worried about her "judgment" and
that her continued employment
would constitute a risk to the
employees and patients of the hospi
tal.
According to Staskus, Williams had
worked for the hospital eight years
before the shooting.
