# Stupid Daily Joke

### 
There's this dad-to-be out in
the hospital waiting room,
pacing into glass windows,
lighting the wrong ends of
cigarettes, sweating a lot. The
doctor walks into the room,
pulling the mask off his face.
He looks a little shaken.
The dad runs up to him.
"Well?" he yells. "What is it?
A boy or a girl?"
The doctor puts his Latexed
hand on the dad's shoulder and
looks him sadly in the eyes. "I
don't know how to break this to
you," he says. "Your child was
born with a deformity. A ter
rible, terrible deformity."
