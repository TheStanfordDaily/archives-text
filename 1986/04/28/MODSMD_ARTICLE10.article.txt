### 
There's this dad-to-be out in
the hospital waiting room,
pacing into glass windows,
lighting the wrong ends of
cigarettes, sweating a lot. The
doctor walks into the room,
pulling the mask off his face.
He looks a little shaken.
The dad runs up to him.
"Well?" he yells. "What is it?
A boy or a girl?"
The doctor puts his Latexed
hand on the dad's shoulder and
looks him sadly in the eyes. "I
don't know how to break this to
you," he says. "Your child was
born with a deformity. A ter
rible, terrible deformity."
The dad sits down hard and
puts his hands over his face.
The doctor sits down next to
him. After a while the dad
looks up and blows the air out
of his cheeks.
"Well," he says bravely.
"He's my kid, no matter what
he looks like." He stands up.
"Take me to see him."
"Be prepared." the doctor
warns him. "This is an awful,
horrible thing."
The doctor puts his arm
around the dad and leads him
to the elevator. They get out at
the basement and walk down
the hall to the Deformed
Babies Ward. There's a glass
window with a line of cribs be
hind it. They stop at the first
crib and look inside. The dad
sinks to his knees.
"Oh my God!" he screams.
"It's just a head! How can this
happen? What kind of life is my
kid going to have? He'll never
play baseball! He'll never drive
a car! He'll never have sex!
He'll never write for The Daily!
I can't believe this has hap
pened to me!"
The doctor looks down at his
shoes. "1 don't know how to
say this," he says, "but it's
worse than that."
They go to the next crib. The
dad lifts his head slowly and
looks inside. There's nothing in
the crib but a huge nose.
"No!" the dad wails. "My
kid's a nose! He can't eat! He
can't talk! He'll never join a
fraternity!"
The doctor touches the dad's
shoulder and shakes his head.
"It's worse than that," he
whispers. "Your child is in the
next crib."
They get to the third crib.
The dad is trembling all over.
He lifts his fingers away from
his eyes, slowly peeks inside the
nursery and screams.
"Aaaahhhhh!!! My kid! My
kid! He's ... an EAR!!"
"It's worse than that," the
doctor says. "He's deaf."
