# Kaplan defends test preparation
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
Test preparation agencies attract students who feel that regular
classes haven't taught them what they need to know and are more than
"a quick fix,"' according to test preparation mogul Stanley Kaplan.
The jovial and enthusiastic Kaplan, in town for the opening of a new
Kaplan Learning Center in Palo Alto, addressed the criticism that his
courses overly prepare students for exams and that test results no longer
measure a student's knowledge but reflect how well a student knows
how to take a test.
"What we are doing is a lot more than teaching students how to take a
test. We do teach test-taking strategies, and these are valuable as they go
through college, but we also teach the material. We are not giving
anybody a quick fix.
"Students who take our (courses) are students who are interested in
doing well," he said.
The new center will be the second in Palo Alto and part of the already
enormous chain of Kaplan centers across the United States.
Annually, thousands of anxious students flock to Kaplan centers in
hopes of gaining an edge for competitive exams. The Kaplan centers ex
pect that 20,000 teenagers this year will spend $395 to take their courses
to prepare for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).
In addition, Kaplan estimates that 40 percent of college students
taking the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and 60 percent taking
the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) will take a $400
preparatory course from one of his centers.
Kaplan centers also provide popular classes aimed at dozens of other
exams such as licensing exams for architecture and accounting. They
even offer a class on how to prepare students for entrance exams into
secondary schools.
Despite the large numbers of people spending money to take
preparatory courses, there has been much controversy as to how helpful
these courses have been. Calling them "schools of crarn," critics have
argued against preparatory classes for numerous reasons.
As for biasing the tests toward those who can afford the courses,
Kaplan claims that he has never turned down a student because of in
ability to pay.
"We give scholarships to people who can't afford us. We want to elimi
nate the economic inequality. Disadvantaged students have been a par
ticular concern of mine. 1 believe that minorities of today will be the
populace of the future," he said.
"We must beef up our education standards and get those people who
can perform and train them to reach their best potential," he added.
