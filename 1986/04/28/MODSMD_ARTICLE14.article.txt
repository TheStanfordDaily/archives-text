## Fraternity attacks unfair 
### 
Now that the Delta Upsilon fraternity will probably lose
both its University recognition and its housing, those
who condemn the fraternity system feel they have scored
a victory. Fraternities <;'c sexist, intolerant, racist, elitist,
anti-intellectual cliques which are indefensible within a
community, such as Stanford, which prides itself on
equality, enlightenment, diversity and tolerance. Or so the
argument goes. But before being swept away by the rheto
ric and carrying the DUs fate to the fraternity system in
general, let's take a second to view the facts from an alter
nate point of view.
Recently, most notably in Luke Cole's letter (Daily,
April 4), fraternities have been criticized for wanton
destruction and theft of property, drug and alcohol abuse,
sexual harassment and violations of the Fundamental
Standard and common decency. Harsh condemnations
examples given include the beating of a freshman
outside a fraternity party and a burning couch being
thrown off the roof of a fraternity house. In fact, the arti
cle notes, the list of fraternity-related offenses keeps
growing.
These examples seem to be convincing evidence against
the continuing existence of fraternities, and this is not an
attempt tocondone anti-social actssuch as those. Yet, one
should pause and wonder why fraternity-related offenses
are singled out while no mention is made of the growing
list of non-fraternity, dorm-related offenses. Why no
mention of the razings of hallway carpets by fire in both

KAZUSANO

Branner and Donner? Why no mention of the toilet
ripped out of the bathroom of Larkin and deposited in the
showers? How about the brick thrown through the televi
sion set in Stern? As for alcohol abuse, what of the recent
"Blow Chow" party at Serra? If any of these incidents had
involved a fraternity member, the repercussions would
have been felt throughout campus. Yet, these equally
reprehensible, non-fraternity incidents are continually
swept under the carpet (albeit perhaps a little burned) in
favor of those involving fraternities. Why?
Some of the cause undoubtedly involves the fact that it
is more meaningful to call someone a DU. a Phi Delt, or a
Sigma Chi, as opposed to a Brannerite or a Larkinite.
More meaningful in that these fraternity names are
stereotypes just as any racial stereotype. And while frater
nity stereotypes are subtler, they carry the same type of
underlying connotations. Connotations that gloss over the
individualism present in the houses and focus on the
homogeneity extant. As point of fact. Rod Coull's con
demnation of the DUs (Daily, April 11) acknowledges
that only certain DUs engage in anti-social behavior, but
then proceeds through the rest of the article to castigate
the DU house as a whole, rather than the individuals re
sponsible. Would he have the same response to an anti
social act committed by a Brannerite? Further, most of
the complaints directed against the fraternity system tend
to focus on the underlying connotations of these
stereotypes.
Charges of sexism, racism and homophobia have been
raised in reference to fraternities. While these qualitites
do exist in some — not all — fraternity members, they
also exist in members of dorms and other Residential
Education housing. Views such as these tend to be crys
tallized before one comes to college, through one's par
ents. friends and experiences. Additionally, while living in
an all-male fraternity may change or exacerbate condi
tions such as sexism, it will exacerbate these conditions no
more so than living in any all-male housing situation, such

as male suites or male floors in sandwich dorms. While the
response to this might be disbanding all-male housing sit
uations altogether, some people's parents, religions or
beliefs do not permit coed living. Despite the universality
of the problem, fraternities are once again singled out,
and held up as bastions of sexism — the sole perpetrators
of the problem.
Further, charges of anti-intellectualism have been
raised in reference to fraternities. Yet this same charge
has also been raised about Stanford in general. In this
context, most undergraduates seem to take an elitist plea
sure in the fact that "Stanford Country Club" rates among
the best universities in the nation. Further, out of fraterni
ties have come more than their fair share of Rhodes
Scholars, Phi Beta Kappas and graduates with departmen
tal honors. Finally, fraternity members are picked from
the Stanford community and thus share the same aca
demic goals and abilities as the rest of the Stanford com
munity.
Probably the best argument against fraternities con
cerns the justification for self-selecting, closed organiza
tions, such as fraternities, to monopolize a central and
desirable part of the student housing. Yet, Residential
Education sanctions the self-selecting process through
which select fix or eight "members" and live in
the attractive "suites' housing arrangement. The returning
resident priority system, coupled with the isolation of the
suites, tends to foster a closed, self-selecting, exclusive
living group. This group, by nature of the number of
people involved, will tend to be more exclusive, and more
self-selecting and more closed to the outside than fraterni
ties, yet they enjoy the approval of Residential Education
while, once again, fraternities do not. Thus, many of the
reasons given for disbanding or de-housing fraternities
appear to not be problems inherent in the Greek system in
particular, but symptoms of problems in society. Doing
away with the fraternity system appears to be a quick fix.
The preceding has not meant to be either a justification
for fraternities — there are acknowledged problems
within the system — or a cry of "pity the fraternities."
Hopefully, however, this article has pointed out the in
equity in holding up problems which fraternities shar*
with Residential Education housing alternatives and using
those problems as indictments of the system. There are no
quick, easy solutions to this problem, and I do not pretend
to have any. Yet these are problems which could be effec
tively dealt with by less drastic means than de-housing or
disbanding the fraternity system: besides the fact that the
problems cited will not be solved by the elimination of the
fraternity system, it would be a shame to deprive those yet
to come of the chance to experience the system for them
selves.
At this point, there are probably many of you wonder
ing, "Is he in a fraternity?" or "He must be in a frater
nity." or perhaps, "He's not in a fraternity." The proper
answer is, "Does it matter?" Would my revealing whether
or not I am a member of a fraternity in some way color the
way my arguments are viewed because of stereotypes?
Presumably, my arguments will stand on their own,
regardless of who presents them. Ultimately, I hope 1
have caused you to re-examine some of your beliefs, pro
or con, concerning the fraternity system and made you
aware of how they may be influenced by non-rational
forces. However, the ultimate decision concerning the fate
of the fraternity system rests with Residential Education,
and whatever that decision may be, hopefully that deci
sion will be reached rationally and dispassionately without
the name-calling, the finger-pointing and the hysteria in
herent in the stereotypes.

desirable part of the student housing. Yet, Residential
Education sanctions the self-selecting process through
which select fix or eight "members" and live in
the attractive "suites' housing arrangement. The returning
resident priority system, coupled with the isolation of the
suites, tends to foster a closed, self-selecting, exclusive
living group. This group, by nature of the number of
people involved, will tend to be more exclusive, and more
self-selecting and more closed to the outside than fraterni
ties, yet they enjoy the approval of Residential Education
while, once again, fraternities do not. Thus, many of the
reasons given for disbanding or de-housing fraternities
appear to not be problems inherent in the Greek system in
particular, but symptoms of problems in society. Doing
away with the fraternity system appears to be a quick fix.
The preceding has not meant to be either a justification
for fraternities — there are acknowledged problems
within the system — or a cry of "pity the fraternities."
Hopefully, however, this article has pointed out the in
equity in holding up problems which fraternities shar*
with Residential Education housing alternatives and using
those problems as indictments of the system. There are no
quick, easy solutions to this problem, and I do not pretend
to have any. Yet these are problems which could be effec
tively dealt with by less drastic means than de-housing or
disbanding the fraternity system: besides the fact that the
problems cited will not be solved by the elimination of the
fraternity system, it would be a shame to deprive those yet
to come of the chance to experience the system for them
selves.
At this point, there are probably many of you wonder
ing, "Is he in a fraternity?" or "He must be in a frater
nity." or perhaps, "He's not in a fraternity." The proper
answer is, "Does it matter?" Would my revealing whether
or not I am a member of a fraternity in some way color the
way my arguments are viewed because of stereotypes?
Presumably, my arguments will stand on their own,
regardless of who presents them. Ultimately, I hope 1
have caused you to re-examine some of your beliefs, pro
or con, concerning the fraternity system and made you
aware of how they may be influenced by non-rational
forces. However, the ultimate decision concerning the fate
of the fraternity system rests with Residential Education,
and whatever that decision may be, hopefully that deci
sion will be reached rationally and dispassionately without
the name-calling, the finger-pointing and the hysteria in
herent in the stereotypes.

Now that the Delta Upsilon fraternity will probably lose
both its University recognition and its housing, those
who condemn the fraternity system feel they have scored
a victory. Fraternities <;'c sexist, intolerant, racist, elitist,
anti-intellectual cliques which are indefensible within a
community, such as Stanford, which prides itself on
equality, enlightenment, diversity and tolerance. Or so the
argument goes. But before being swept away by the rheto
ric and carrying the DUs fate to the fraternity system in
general, let's take a second to view the facts from an alter
nate point of view.
Recently, most notably in Luke Cole's letter (Daily,
April 4), fraternities have been criticized for wanton
destruction and theft of property, drug and alcohol abuse,
sexual harassment and violations of the Fundamental
Standard and common decency. Harsh condemnations
examples given include the beating of a freshman
outside a fraternity party and a burning couch being
thrown off the roof of a fraternity house. In fact, the arti
cle notes, the list of fraternity-related offenses keeps
growing.
These examples seem to be convincing evidence against
the continuing existence of fraternities, and this is not an
attempt tocondone anti-social actssuch as those. Yet, one
should pause and wonder why fraternity-related offenses
are singled out while no mention is made of the growing
list of non-fraternity, dorm-related offenses. Why no
mention of the razings of hallway carpets by fire in both

KAZUSANO

Branner and Donner? Why no mention of the toilet
ripped out of the bathroom of Larkin and deposited in the
showers? How about the brick thrown through the televi
sion set in Stern? As for alcohol abuse, what of the recent
"Blow Chow" party at Serra? If any of these incidents had
involved a fraternity member, the repercussions would
have been felt throughout campus. Yet, these equally
reprehensible, non-fraternity incidents are continually
swept under the carpet (albeit perhaps a little burned) in
favor of those involving fraternities. Why?
Some of the cause undoubtedly involves the fact that it
is more meaningful to call someone a DU. a Phi Delt, or a
Sigma Chi, as opposed to a Brannerite or a Larkinite.
More meaningful in that these fraternity names are
stereotypes just as any racial stereotype. And while frater
nity stereotypes are subtler, they carry the same type of
underlying connotations. Connotations that gloss over the
individualism present in the houses and focus on the
homogeneity extant. As point of fact. Rod Coull's con
demnation of the DUs (Daily, April 11) acknowledges
that only certain DUs engage in anti-social behavior, but
then proceeds through the rest of the article to castigate
the DU house as a whole, rather than the individuals re
sponsible. Would he have the same response to an anti
social act committed by a Brannerite? Further, most of
the complaints directed against the fraternity system tend
to focus on the underlying connotations of these
stereotypes.
Charges of sexism, racism and homophobia have been
raised in reference to fraternities. While these qualitites
do exist in some — not all — fraternity members, they
also exist in members of dorms and other Residential
Education housing. Views such as these tend to be crys
tallized before one comes to college, through one's par
ents. friends and experiences. Additionally, while living in
an all-male fraternity may change or exacerbate condi
tions such as sexism, it will exacerbate these conditions no
more so than living in any all-male housing situation, such

as male suites or male floors in sandwich dorms. While the
response to this might be disbanding all-male housing sit
uations altogether, some people's parents, religions or
beliefs do not permit coed living. Despite the universality
of the problem, fraternities are once again singled out,
and held up as bastions of sexism — the sole perpetrators
of the problem.
Further, charges of anti-intellectualism have been
raised in reference to fraternities. Yet this same charge
has also been raised about Stanford in general. In this
context, most undergraduates seem to take an elitist plea
sure in the fact that "Stanford Country Club" rates among
the best universities in the nation. Further, out of fraterni
ties have come more than their fair share of Rhodes
Scholars, Phi Beta Kappas and graduates with departmen
tal honors. Finally, fraternity members are picked from
the Stanford community and thus share the same aca
demic goals and abilities as the rest of the Stanford com
munity.
Probably the best argument against fraternities con
cerns the justification for self-selecting, closed organiza
tions, such as fraternities, to monopolize a central and
desirable part of the student housing. Yet, Residential
Education sanctions the self-selecting process through
