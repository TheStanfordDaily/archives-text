Consensus needed
on terrorist policy
President Reagan authorized mili
tary action against Libya as a signal to
state-sponsored terrorists that the
United States will not allow its
citizens to he the victims of indis
criminate terror throughout the
world. It is imperative that terrorism
be divorced from both international
politics and international trade.
There is absolutely no justification
for opening fire at an airport or
bombing a discotheque. The targets
in both cases were innocent people
singled out only because of the pass
port they carried.
Many people argue that interna
tional terrorism has grown out of the
problems of the Middle East, and that
there will be no end to terrorist at
tacks until solutions are found to the

Arab-Israeli confict and the fate of
the Palestinian peole.
Such "root causes," however, no
matter how genuine or well-founded,
do not justify the killing of innocent
people in Europe. As Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli Representa
tive to the United Nations, stated in
his article entitled "Terrorism" in the
April 14 issue of Time magazine, ter
rorism's goal is to blur the distinction
between combatant and non
combatant: to obfuscate our sense of
right and wrong. The repeated target
ing of non-combatants has turned
terrorism into a moral issue, and as
such the West must respond with
strength and solidarity.
European vacillation on this issue
is highly objectionable. The French
and Italians naively believe that by al
lowing terrorists free passage they
will avoid such actions from being
perpetrated in their terrority. The

events of the last few months have
proved quite the opposite.
No one should know better than
the Europeans, who have been the
victims of indigenous terrorist groups
since the late 19605, that terrorism
can only be effectively countered by
taking strict punitive measures
against the terrorists, and not giving
in.
In Italy, terrorism grew through the
1970s and apexed with the sensa
tional kidnapping of Aldo Moro, a
member of the Italian Parliament, by
the Red Brigade Only after the Ital
ian government took the courageous
stand against negotiation and Moro
was killed did terrorism dissipate in
Italy. While it still exists, its size is al
most negligible compared to the late
'70s.
In Germany also, a strong stand
against the Baader-Meinhof Gang,
and the Entebbe-style rescue of

Geman hostages in Mogadishu,
Somalia in 1977 resulted in the vir
tual collapse of the German terrorist
network.
The countries of Western Europe
carry on extensive trade with Libya,
and are afraid to condemn Libyan in
volvement with international ter
rorism for fear that Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy will terminate oil
shipments. The point that must be
highlighted is that trade and the nor
mal day-to-day relations between
countries must be divorced from ter
rorism. The former is business. The
latter is murder.
Until there is world consensus on
this point, terrorism will continue to
flourish as another trump card in the
game of politics
