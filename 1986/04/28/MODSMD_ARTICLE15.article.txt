Consensus needed
on terrorist policy
President Reagan authorized mili
tary action against Libya as a signal to
state-sponsored terrorists that the
United States will not allow its
citizens to he the victims of indis
criminate terror throughout the
world. It is imperative that terrorism
be divorced from both international
politics and international trade.
There is absolutely no justification
for opening fire at an airport or
bombing a discotheque. The targets
in both cases were innocent people
singled out only because of the pass
port they carried.
Many people argue that interna
tional terrorism has grown out of the
problems of the Middle East, and that
there will be no end to terrorist at
tacks until solutions are found to the

Arab-Israeli confict and the fate of
the Palestinian peole.
Such "root causes," however, no
matter how genuine or well-founded,
do not justify the killing of innocent
people in Europe. As Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli Representa
tive to the United Nations, stated in
his article entitled "Terrorism" in the
April 14 issue of Time magazine, ter
rorism's goal is to blur the distinction
between combatant and non
combatant: to obfuscate our sense of
right and wrong. The repeated target
ing of non-combatants has turned
terrorism into a moral issue, and as
such the West must respond with
strength and solidarity.
European vacillation on this issue
is highly objectionable. The French
and Italians naively believe that by al
lowing terrorists free passage they
will avoid such actions from being
perpetrated in their terrority. The

events of the last few months have
proved quite the opposite.
No one should know better than
the Europeans, who have been the
victims of indigenous terrorist groups
since the late 19605, that terrorism
can only be effectively countered by
taking strict punitive measures
against the terrorists, and not giving
in.
In Italy, terrorism grew through the
1970s and apexed with the sensa
tional kidnapping of Aldo Moro, a
member of the Italian Parliament, by
the Red Brigade Only after the Ital
ian government took the courageous
stand against negotiation and Moro
was killed did terrorism dissipate in
Italy. While it still exists, its size is al
most negligible compared to the late
'70s.
In Germany also, a strong stand
against the Baader-Meinhof Gang,
and the Entebbe-style rescue of

Geman hostages in Mogadishu,
Somalia in 1977 resulted in the vir
tual collapse of the German terrorist
network.
The countries of Western Europe
carry on extensive trade with Libya,
and are afraid to condemn Libyan in
volvement with international ter
rorism for fear that Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy will terminate oil
shipments. The point that must be
highlighted is that trade and the nor
mal day-to-day relations between
countries must be divorced from ter
rorism. The former is business. The
latter is murder.
Until there is world consensus on
this point, terrorism will continue to
flourish as another trump card in the
game of politics

Affirmative action
promotes racism
Recently, a column by Hardy Call
cott and a story about an address to a
political science course by lawyer Eva
Paterson extolled the virtues of af
firmative action programs. These two
articles caught my attention because
they epitomized a fatal flaw which too
often characterizes "liberal" thought:
well-intentioned goals sought
through short-sighted and mis
directed policies.
The presumed goal of affirmative
action is to work toward a color
blind, gender-blind world with equal
opportunities for all citizens. The goal
is an admirable one, but affirmative
action leads us in the opposite direc
tion.
Consider an example close to my
own heart: medical school admis
sions. Special provisions for minority
applicants abound. They include
"special encouragements" for
minority students to apply, additional
special grants, assistance from
"Affirmative Action Coordinators"
and sometimes even an early decision
plan for minorities only.
Hard as it may be for some fanatics
to swallow, many white males have
nothing against blacks or any other
minority groups. Like many white
males, neither I nor any of my ances
tors participated in oppression of
minorities. It is no more my fault than
theirs that they are "statistically
under-represented" in the medical
profession. Just as it was wrong to
bring blacks to America for enslave
ment, it is wrong to punish innocent
whites. Young white men today serve
as convenient scapegoats for modern
ethnic plights in which they had no
role in bringing about.

What happens to the qualified
white male refused admission in favor
of a minority applicant? He may very
well come to resent the system as well
as minority groups which he feels un
justly usurped his place in medical
school. This hardly sounds like a step
toward abolition of racism and ine
quality. Like Clarence Pendleton, I
believe that affirmative action breeds
a new. more insidious form of racism.
Some proponents of affirmative ac
tion insist that they are not advocat
ing placement of unqualified
minorities above qualified white
males. Take, then, the case of a deci
sion between equally qualified black
and white applicants. How would this
decision be made in a color-blind so
ciety? By flipping a coin. Anyone
who professes to work for such a soci
ety should support this method over a
racist scheme which favors one race
over another.
The take-home message here is
that equality of opportunity and
abolition of prejudice cannot and
should not be legislated or enacted by
edict of some admissions committee
or personnel department.
Advocates of affirmative action
should look in the mirror when they
fire charges of racism and discrimina
tion. We should recognize the hypoc
risy of opposing discrimination
against blacks and women while ac
quiescing in discrimination against
whites and males. If Callcott's
convictions are as earnest as he
presents, perhaps he wouldn't mind
relinquishing his place in the
prestigious Law School to a member
of a less-privileged minority. As for
Paterson, who warns that "a few
of you white men are going to have to
sit down (to let others catch up)," I
say white men have rights, too. Let's
not replace one form of racism with
another.

for opening fire at an airport or
bombing a discotheque. The targets
in both cases were innocent people
singled out only because of the pass
port they carried.
Many people argue that interna
tional terrorism has grown out of the
problems of the Middle East, and that
there will be no end to terrorist at
tacks until solutions are found to the

Arab-Israeli confict and the fate of
the Palestinian peole.
Such "root causes," however, no
matter how genuine or well-founded,
do not justify the killing of innocent
people in Europe. As Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli Representa
tive to the United Nations, stated in
his article entitled "Terrorism" in the
April 14 issue of Time magazine, ter
rorism's goal is to blur the distinction
between combatant and non
combatant: to obfuscate our sense of
right and wrong. The repeated target
ing of non-combatants has turned
terrorism into a moral issue, and as
such the West must respond with
strength and solidarity.
European vacillation on this issue
is highly objectionable. The French
and Italians naively believe that by al
lowing terrorists free passage they
will avoid such actions from being
perpetrated in their terrority. The

events of the last few months have
proved quite the opposite.
No one should know better than
the Europeans, who have been the
victims of indigenous terrorist groups
since the late 19605, that terrorism
can only be effectively countered by
taking strict punitive measures
against the terrorists, and not giving
in.
In Italy, terrorism grew through the
1970s and apexed with the sensa
tional kidnapping of Aldo Moro, a
member of the Italian Parliament, by
the Red Brigade Only after the Ital
ian government took the courageous
stand against negotiation and Moro
was killed did terrorism dissipate in
Italy. While it still exists, its size is al
most negligible compared to the late
'70s.
In Germany also, a strong stand
against the Baader-Meinhof Gang,
and the Entebbe-style rescue of

Geman hostages in Mogadishu,
Somalia in 1977 resulted in the vir
tual collapse of the German terrorist
network.
The countries of Western Europe
carry on extensive trade with Libya,
and are afraid to condemn Libyan in
volvement with international ter
rorism for fear that Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy will terminate oil
shipments. The point that must be
highlighted is that trade and the nor
mal day-to-day relations between
countries must be divorced from ter
rorism. The former is business. The
latter is murder.
Until there is world consensus on
this point, terrorism will continue to
flourish as another trump card in the
game of politics

Affirmative action
promotes racism
Recently, a column by Hardy Call
cott and a story about an address to a
political science course by lawyer Eva
Paterson extolled the virtues of af
firmative action programs. These two
articles caught my attention because
they epitomized a fatal flaw which too
often characterizes "liberal" thought:
well-intentioned goals sought
through short-sighted and mis
directed policies.
The presumed goal of affirmative
action is to work toward a color
blind, gender-blind world with equal
opportunities for all citizens. The goal
is an admirable one, but affirmative
action leads us in the opposite direc
tion.
Consider an example close to my
own heart: medical school admis
sions. Special provisions for minority
applicants abound. They include
"special encouragements" for
minority students to apply, additional
special grants, assistance from
"Affirmative Action Coordinators"
and sometimes even an early decision
plan for minorities only.
Hard as it may be for some fanatics
to swallow, many white males have
nothing against blacks or any other
minority groups. Like many white
males, neither I nor any of my ances
tors participated in oppression of
minorities. It is no more my fault than
theirs that they are "statistically
under-represented" in the medical
profession. Just as it was wrong to
bring blacks to America for enslave
ment, it is wrong to punish innocent
whites. Young white men today serve
as convenient scapegoats for modern
ethnic plights in which they had no
role in bringing about.

What happens to the qualified
white male refused admission in favor
of a minority applicant? He may very
well come to resent the system as well
as minority groups which he feels un
justly usurped his place in medical
school. This hardly sounds like a step
toward abolition of racism and ine
quality. Like Clarence Pendleton, I
believe that affirmative action breeds
a new. more insidious form of racism.
Some proponents of affirmative ac
tion insist that they are not advocat
ing placement of unqualified
minorities above qualified white
males. Take, then, the case of a deci
sion between equally qualified black
and white applicants. How would this
decision be made in a color-blind so
ciety? By flipping a coin. Anyone
who professes to work for such a soci
ety should support this method over a
racist scheme which favors one race
over another.
The take-home message here is
that equality of opportunity and
abolition of prejudice cannot and
should not be legislated or enacted by
edict of some admissions committee
or personnel department.
Advocates of affirmative action
should look in the mirror when they
fire charges of racism and discrimina
tion. We should recognize the hypoc
risy of opposing discrimination
against blacks and women while ac
quiescing in discrimination against
whites and males. If Callcott's
convictions are as earnest as he
presents, perhaps he wouldn't mind
relinquishing his place in the
prestigious Law School to a member
of a less-privileged minority. As for
Paterson, who warns that "a few
of you white men are going to have to
sit down (to let others catch up)," I
say white men have rights, too. Let's
not replace one form of racism with
another.
