# Deal with illegal protests
## 
### 
A few weeks ago police arrested 61 anti-apartheid
protesters at UC-Berkeley. Usually, university administra
tors are reluctant to act against protesters — they want to
neither aggravate the protest nor appear to betray their
academic commitment to the free flow and expression of
ideas. A few weeks ago, however, Berkeley officials were
driven to act. What motivated the arrests?
In the days before, students and other protesters had
constructed 12 shacks that effectively blocked entrances
to California Hall, the Berkeley administration building.
The protesters had even nailed two of them to the build
ing's walls.
Administrators' attempts to rid the building of the il
legal shacks and their occupants without arrests or even
the presence of police were ridiculously and embarrass
ingly accommodating.

Suppose you owned a house in Palo Alto (or anywhere
for that matter) and one day some college kids decided to
build a shack at each entrance to your home (one of which
they nailed to your walls), preventing you from getting in
and out. What would you do?
For starters, a statement like "What do you idiots think
you're doing?" followed by "Move you and your garbage
out of here before I call the police" might be appropriate.
When you notice the damage to your home you might
even sue the delinquents.
You would react very differently if you were a Berkeley
administrator, however. First you would have the shacks
declared a fire hazard to legitimize your request that they
be removed (as if the inconvenience of their presence
wasn't enough). Then you would offer to help the students
build a new shack at a location you could both agree on.
It is appalling that university administrators feel the
need to take such an apologetic, groveling and accommo
dating tone when dealing with a group of self-righteous
vandals. Protesters' attempts at political persuasion,
demonstrating utter disregard for others' property and
freedom and grossly overstepping the bounds of con
structive debate should be clearly and strongly con
demned, never accommodated.
The Berkeley protesters (as well as those at Stanford)
believe they should be exempt from such condemnation:
they are convinced that the nobility of their cause entitles
them to use any means they choose to persuade the UC
system to divest its holdings in companies doing business
with South Africa.
Certainly most would agree that few fights (if any) are

nobler than the fight for equality under the law in South
Africa. But the nobility of a protester's cause does not al
low him or her to choose any means of convincing others
of its nobility.
Berkeley administrators should have treated the
protesters from the beginning as the self-righteous and ar
rogant lawbreakers that they are. They should have been
told to move or be arrested. No declaration by the fire
marshal that the shacks were fire hazards was required.
Certainly no offer by adminstrators to help erect a new
shack elsewhere was necessary either.
When the police were finally called in to remove the
shacks and the Berkeley protesters, some protesters,
stabbed at police through the walls of the shacks in at-'
tempts to beat them away. Other protesters pelted police
buses carrying arrestees to jail with garbage and rocks. 1
Still others overturned metal trash containers and broke a'
police car's window.
What did Stanford anti-apartheid activists have to say',
about the events at Berkeley? Steve Phillips, chairman of*
the Black Student Union said of the violent protesters,!
"Their actions and commitment are inspiring." It would;
seem that self-righteous protesters are not found only on
the Berkeley campus.
Junior Marvin Jackson, a member of Stanford Out of
South Africa, said that he "was really shocked that the
Berkeley administration acted the way it did" and that he
hopes "the Stanford better" whei\
SOSA rebuilds its shanty this quarter (Daily, April 2f.
1, too, had hoped Stanford administrators would react#
better. I had hoped that University President Donald
Kennedy and his administration would order all future
eyesores on the Stanford campus removed. Will Stanford
officials ever realize that to order offensive shacks
removed from White Plaza or the quad is not to attack the
cause of the protesters or to limit their freedom of speech?
Such an action would simply be an enforcement of the
limits on acceptable forms of debate, not only at Stanford,
but in a free society.
A group may believe what it wishes and try to persuade J
others to join its cause, but the means of persuasion open
to it are not unlimited. Building grass-killing eyesores in
White Plaza and defacing the Quad with obnoxious signs
and shacks are not among acceptable means of persua- ;
sion.
One would expect Kennedy and his administration to!
enforce the bounds of debate if they take their roles as;
teachers, administrators and champions of academic
freedom seriously. But, as always, it is much easier to sit<
back and do nothing. History shows us that most choose;
the convenience of inaction over harmony of conscience. •
Perhaps Mother Nature will grace the Quad with a!
timely visit as she did White Plaza last quarter. Then ad-.'
ministrators would be spared the agony of having to fulfill -
their responsibilities and students would be spared having
to endure another eyesore.
