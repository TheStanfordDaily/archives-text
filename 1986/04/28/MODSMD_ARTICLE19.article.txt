## Education key to earthquake readiness 
### 
Several small earthquakes have jolted the
campus in recent years. The magnitude 5.3
earthquake at 4 a.m. on registration day was just
the right size — great fun watching the after
shocks on the Terman seismograph but no
damage other than loss of sleep. The principal
benefit was the reminder that we should be pre
paring for a major earthquake, as pointed out in
a recent Daily editorial.

JAMES GERE, ET AL.

Stanford students and staff should be hear
tened to know that earthquake preparedness has
been an important campus activity for at least
two decades. Much Is being done to make the
campus safer when "the big one" comes. Educa
tional materials are distributed to students and
staff every year, earthquake evacuation drills test
emergency procedures, disaster plans have been
carefully prepared by police, fire and hospital
personnel, and millions of dollars have been
spent to seismically strengthen campus buildings.
From the standpoint of personal protection,
each of us needs to know a few simple rules about
earthquake safety. In a strong earthquake, the
ground may shake perceptibly for a minute or
more. The motion is apt to be frightening, but
you have no choice except to wait for it to end.
You must remain calm and in control of yourself.
Act immediately to protect yourself from falling
objects or debris by getting under a table or desk
or by huddling in a corner of a room. Don't be
embarrassed by your actions; the people who
wait "to see how long it lasts" are more likely to
get hurt. Expect the electricity to go out, and ex
pect to hear noise from falling objects, breaking
glass and cracking in buildings. Be alert for after
shocks which, even though small, can cause addi
tional damage to already weakened buildings.
Most Californians have heard about the things
they can do in advance to lessen the earthquake
hazard — for instance, keep a working flashlight
and battery-operated AM/FM radio accessible;

learn how to use fire extinguishers and where
they are located; avoid storing heavy objects on
shelves above beds or desks; and don't sleep next
to a large pane of glass.
To learn more about personal safety in
earthquakes and what to do before, during, and
after they occur, phone Earthquake Information
723-0569 (a service of the Department of Public
Safety). Request a copy of the booklet,
"Earthquakes — How to Protect Your Life and
Property." They can also provide you with
leaflets about what to do as a student to prepare
for an earthquake in your residence. Bulk quanti
ties of these and other publications are available
for student groups upon request.

Stanford will endure its
second great
earthquake in the not
too-distant future.

The seismic renovation of buildings in the
Quad is now about three-fourths completed. The
University's program of strengthening old build
ings is a regular part of facilities and financial
planning. The most recent structural strengthen
ing projects for earthquakes were History Corner
and the front wall of Memorial Church. At His
tory Corner the sandstone walls and arches were
taken down, stone by stone, and a modern steel
and reinforced concrete structure was built. The
stones were then replaced, each one tied by a
metal anchor to the new structure. The finished
building looks almost like the original, and the
historic Quad architecture is preserved while
providing a structure that meets current
earthquake standards. In addition, the dams at
Searsville Lake, Felt Lake and Lagunita are in
spected annually, and as a precaution Lagunita is
no longer filled to capacity.

Earthquake preparedness is actively promoted
by the Department of Public Safety (fire and
police) under Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and the Office of Health and Safety under Alain
Decleve. Every other year Public Safety sponsors
a "fake quake" disaster drill (to be held tomor
row, April 29). This event simulates a major
earthquake occurring on the San Andreas fault
not far from the campus, and emergency opera
tions personnel, including those at the hospital,
practice their response procedures. The Univer
sity's "Emergency Operations Plan," in effect
since 1981, is put into action.
Earthquake safety in laboratories, offices and
classrooms is monitored by the Health and Safety
office. They prepare guidelines for laboratory
directors, conduct inspections, inform employees
about earthquake preparations and distribute in
formational literature.
If you want to learn more about earthquakes,
consider taking Geology I. Or just go to the
bookstore and pick up a copy of "Terra Non
Firma — Understanding and Preparing for
Earthquakes." Be sure to buy the Stanford
Alumni Association edition, because then all the
proceeds go to Stanford (not to the authors). This
paperback book was written in 1984 after we had
the horrifying experience of watching students
run out of Terman during a small shake and stand
beneath five stories of large panes of glass.
It is certain that the Stanford campus will
endure its second great earthquake in the not
too-distant future. Just when, nobody can
predict. But when it comes, Stanford's efforts at
preparedness will reap dividends in lives saved
and damage minimized. Each of us can contrib
ute to this goal by learning to cope with
earthquakes in an intelligent way and by taking
advantage of the resources made available to us
on campus.

tened to know that earthquake preparedness has
been an important campus activity for at least
two decades. Much Is being done to make the
campus safer when "the big one" comes. Educa
tional materials are distributed to students and
staff every year, earthquake evacuation drills test
emergency procedures, disaster plans have been
carefully prepared by police, fire and hospital
personnel, and millions of dollars have been
spent to seismically strengthen campus buildings.
From the standpoint of personal protection,
each of us needs to know a few simple rules about
earthquake safety. In a strong earthquake, the
ground may shake perceptibly for a minute or
more. The motion is apt to be frightening, but
you have no choice except to wait for it to end.
You must remain calm and in control of yourself.
Act immediately to protect yourself from falling
objects or debris by getting under a table or desk
or by huddling in a corner of a room. Don't be
embarrassed by your actions; the people who
wait "to see how long it lasts" are more likely to
get hurt. Expect the electricity to go out, and ex
pect to hear noise from falling objects, breaking
glass and cracking in buildings. Be alert for after
shocks which, even though small, can cause addi
tional damage to already weakened buildings.
Most Californians have heard about the things
they can do in advance to lessen the earthquake
hazard — for instance, keep a working flashlight
and battery-operated AM/FM radio accessible;

learn how to use fire extinguishers and where
they are located; avoid storing heavy objects on
shelves above beds or desks; and don't sleep next
to a large pane of glass.
To learn more about personal safety in
earthquakes and what to do before, during, and
after they occur, phone Earthquake Information
723-0569 (a service of the Department of Public
Safety). Request a copy of the booklet,
"Earthquakes — How to Protect Your Life and
Property." They can also provide you with
leaflets about what to do as a student to prepare
for an earthquake in your residence. Bulk quanti
ties of these and other publications are available
for student groups upon request.

Stanford will endure its
second great
earthquake in the not
too-distant future.

The seismic renovation of buildings in the
Quad is now about three-fourths completed. The
University's program of strengthening old build
ings is a regular part of facilities and financial
planning. The most recent structural strengthen
ing projects for earthquakes were History Corner
and the front wall of Memorial Church. At His
tory Corner the sandstone walls and arches were
taken down, stone by stone, and a modern steel
and reinforced concrete structure was built. The
stones were then replaced, each one tied by a
metal anchor to the new structure. The finished
building looks almost like the original, and the
historic Quad architecture is preserved while
providing a structure that meets current
earthquake standards. In addition, the dams at
Searsville Lake, Felt Lake and Lagunita are in
spected annually, and as a precaution Lagunita is
no longer filled to capacity.

Earthquake preparedness is actively promoted
by the Department of Public Safety (fire and
police) under Police Chief Marvin Herrington
and the Office of Health and Safety under Alain
Decleve. Every other year Public Safety sponsors
a "fake quake" disaster drill (to be held tomor
row, April 29). This event simulates a major
earthquake occurring on the San Andreas fault
not far from the campus, and emergency opera
tions personnel, including those at the hospital,
practice their response procedures. The Univer
sity's "Emergency Operations Plan," in effect
since 1981, is put into action.
Earthquake safety in laboratories, offices and
classrooms is monitored by the Health and Safety
office. They prepare guidelines for laboratory
directors, conduct inspections, inform employees
about earthquake preparations and distribute in
formational literature.
If you want to learn more about earthquakes,
consider taking Geology I. Or just go to the
bookstore and pick up a copy of "Terra Non
Firma — Understanding and Preparing for
Earthquakes." Be sure to buy the Stanford
Alumni Association edition, because then all the
proceeds go to Stanford (not to the authors). This
paperback book was written in 1984 after we had
the horrifying experience of watching students
run out of Terman during a small shake and stand
beneath five stories of large panes of glass.
It is certain that the Stanford campus will
endure its second great earthquake in the not
too-distant future. Just when, nobody can
predict. But when it comes, Stanford's efforts at
preparedness will reap dividends in lives saved
and damage minimized. Each of us can contrib
ute to this goal by learning to cope with
earthquakes in an intelligent way and by taking
advantage of the resources made available to us
on campus.

Several small earthquakes have jolted the
campus in recent years. The magnitude 5.3
earthquake at 4 a.m. on registration day was just
the right size — great fun watching the after
shocks on the Terman seismograph but no
damage other than loss of sleep. The principal
benefit was the reminder that we should be pre
paring for a major earthquake, as pointed out in
a recent Daily editorial.
