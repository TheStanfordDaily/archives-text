The battle of the bugs
Everyone knows that Bug Me is a hallowed
Stanford tradition. At Harvard, there is Bug
Table.
Harvard has "theme tables" — French
tables, U.S. history tables, current events
tables, even rectangular tables. At meals,
eager Crimsonites sit around such tables and
discuss the prescribed topic. The tables are
kind of like theme houses, except that you
can't live on a table.
Anyway, a few weeks ago a crew of mis
chievous Crimsonites banded together and
formed what is now known as the "Bug
Table." The subject at this table is — you
guessed it — bugs.
The members of this table then staged an
election for the "Best Bug." As evidence of
the civic-minded nature of Harvard students,
more than half of the dorm in which the bug
table is located voted in the election.
The victorious insect was the orange and
black Mexican Black Beetle, but only by a
vote. Close behind were the Mexican Bean
Beetle and the Harlequin.
However, some students said they were
bugged by the whole ordeal. "Though we
tried to discourage lobbying, there was in
tense campaigning," said senior Jennifer
Lloret.
Rumor has it that the Mexican Black Beetle
plans to run for the Cambridge City Council
in November. "No flies on me," he allegedly
claimed.
Dorm scum
While half of those students were busy
voting, the other half was at work making a

certain Harvard dorm room the "Scummiest
Dorm on Campus."
Although the residents of the room wished
to remain anonymous, one member of the
house explained how the title was won.
"One night we were sick of studying so we
just threw an orange against the wall. The or
ange was about two months old and very soft.

When it hit the wall it looked nice — like
fireworks," the resident said.
Later, imaginative Harvard students added
to this collage of bits of banana. Edge gel, Joy
dishwashing liquid, hair mousse, phlegm, a
chocolate chip cookie and some cough
medicine, among other things.
And indeed, the art is not only confined to
the walls of this scummiest room. A pool of
Pepsi marks the entrance to the common
room, which contains everything from semi
dehydrated drinks to a petrified ham and
cheese croissant.
However, according to the Harvard Crim
son, the residents of the room plan to clean
the mess up in the near future because they
are "worried about bugs."
The Mexican Black Beetle had no com
ment.

The case of the doomed deli
It was two turkey sandwiches on hard rolls
with lettuce and pickles that did them in.
The case: an illegal deli operating out of a
Rutgers University dorm room.
The deli: The Late Night, offering a wide
variety of sandwiches, free mayo, mustard
and ketchup and $ 1 off every delivery that
takes longer than 25 minutes.

The investigating officer: Detective Joseph
Pagano, Rutgers University Police.
The operations of the Late Night Deli got
stung when they got the call to delive/ those
sandwiches to 5 Huntington Street.
The address: University Police
Headquarters.
Pagano said that he did not feel that the two
businessmen knew that they were in trouble
at the time of the call, "but I think they
realized it on the way over here," he ex
plained.
And although the students got caught red
handed, no charges were pressed by the
police.
"We opted not to prosecute in any way,"
said University police detective James Picker

ing. "We just told them that they could not
operate a business out of their room."
"They had a pretty good menu, too," he
added.
And with no charges filed, what's an officer
to do with the evidence — but digest it.
Where there's a Will. . . .
Williams College in western Massachusetts
is a small college, nestled in the peaceful
Berkshire Mountains. The Berkshires are so
peaceful, in fact, that sometimes Williams stu
dents get bored and do some crazy things.
What kinds of things do bored Williams
students do? Well, they dive down staircases,
for one. Head first.
Stair-diving is apparently an age-old tradi
tion that began decades ago as a fraternity
prank. Williams students liked it so much that
it is now the favorite indoor sport on campus,
according to the Swarthmore Phoenix. One
Williams student said that he stair-dives "as a
substitute for sex."
This indoor sport does not bode well for the
future of Williams College. Unless, of course,
some new scientific study can prove that Wil
liams staircases are sufficiently fertile.
This debate went to the dogs
When the University of Pennsylvania
Debate Club and the Swarthmore College
Forensics Society square off, one might think
that the topic of debate would be the origin of
man, or the nature of existence, or at least the
federal deficit.
But not the relative merits of dog feces.
Yet that is exactly what the two teams did
debate last month, much to the chagrin of a

few members of the Swarthmore Society.
The designated topic of the debate was
"Living in America,"and the Penn team
opened the debate by calling for a constitu
tional amendment requiring the owner of the
animal in question to do his duty, so to speak,
and remove the waste of the dog.
"We could have a group called 'Miami
Poop* that would enforce this law," Penn
debater Robert Segall said.
This suggestion drew a strong response
from the Swarthmore team. One member
called the proposed amendment unfair. "Why
discriminate only against dogs?" he asked.
"Seems to me that horse poops are far more
dangerous."

Indeed, Swarthmore debater Reid
Neureiter called the suggestion "an attempt
to turn the constitution into toilet paper."
And in the end, the Swarthmore team won
the debate.
But it was a dog-eat-dog battle.

Pagano said that he did not feel that the two
businessmen knew that they were in trouble
at the time of the call, "but I think they
realized it on the way over here," he ex
plained.
And although the students got caught red
handed, no charges were pressed by the
police.
"We opted not to prosecute in any way,"
said University police detective James Picker

ing. "We just told them that they could not
operate a business out of their room."
"They had a pretty good menu, too," he
added.

Where there's a Will. . . .
Williams College in western Massachusetts
is a small college, nestled in the peaceful
Berkshire Mountains. The Berkshires are so
peaceful, in fact, that sometimes Williams stu
dents get bored and do some crazy things.
What kinds of things do bored Williams
students do? Well, they dive down staircases,
for one. Head first.
Stair-diving is apparently an age-old tradi
tion that began decades ago as a fraternity
prank. Williams students liked it so much that
it is now the favorite indoor sport on campus,
according to the Swarthmore Phoenix. One
Williams student said that he stair-dives "as a
substitute for sex."
This indoor sport does not bode well for the
future of Williams College. Unless, of course,
some new scientific study can prove that Wil
liams staircases are sufficiently fertile.
This debate went to the dogs
When the University of Pennsylvania
Debate Club and the Swarthmore College
Forensics Society square off, one might think
that the topic of debate would be the origin of
man, or the nature of existence, or at least the
federal deficit.
But not the relative merits of dog feces.
Yet that is exactly what the two teams did
debate last month, much to the chagrin of a

few members of the Swarthmore Society.
The designated topic of the debate was
"Living in America,"and the Penn team
opened the debate by calling for a constitu
tional amendment requiring the owner of the
animal in question to do his duty, so to speak,
and remove the waste of the dog.
"We could have a group called 'Miami
Poop* that would enforce this law," Penn
debater Robert Segall said.
This suggestion drew a strong response
from the Swarthmore team. One member
called the proposed amendment unfair. "Why
discriminate only against dogs?" he asked.
"Seems to me that horse poops are far more
dangerous."

Indeed, Swarthmore debater Reid
Neureiter called the suggestion "an attempt
to turn the constitution into toilet paper."
And in the end, the Swarthmore team won
the debate.
But it was a dog-eat-dog battle.

The battle of the bugs
Everyone knows that Bug Me is a hallowed
Stanford tradition. At Harvard, there is Bug
Table.
Harvard has "theme tables" — French
tables, U.S. history tables, current events
tables, even rectangular tables. At meals,
eager Crimsonites sit around such tables and
discuss the prescribed topic. The tables are
kind of like theme houses, except that you
can't live on a table.
Anyway, a few weeks ago a crew of mis
chievous Crimsonites banded together and
formed what is now known as the "Bug
Table." The subject at this table is — you
guessed it — bugs.
The members of this table then staged an
election for the "Best Bug." As evidence of
the civic-minded nature of Harvard students,
more than half of the dorm in which the bug
table is located voted in the election.
The victorious insect was the orange and
black Mexican Black Beetle, but only by a
vote. Close behind were the Mexican Bean
Beetle and the Harlequin.
However, some students said they were
bugged by the whole ordeal. "Though we
tried to discourage lobbying, there was in
tense campaigning," said senior Jennifer
Lloret.
Rumor has it that the Mexican Black Beetle
plans to run for the Cambridge City Council
in November. "No flies on me," he allegedly
claimed.
Dorm scum
While half of those students were busy
voting, the other half was at work making a

certain Harvard dorm room the "Scummiest
Dorm on Campus."
Although the residents of the room wished
to remain anonymous, one member of the
house explained how the title was won.
"One night we were sick of studying so we
just threw an orange against the wall. The or
ange was about two months old and very soft.

When it hit the wall it looked nice — like
fireworks," the resident said.
Later, imaginative Harvard students added
to this collage of bits of banana. Edge gel, Joy
dishwashing liquid, hair mousse, phlegm, a
chocolate chip cookie and some cough
medicine, among other things.
And indeed, the art is not only confined to
the walls of this scummiest room. A pool of
Pepsi marks the entrance to the common
room, which contains everything from semi
dehydrated drinks to a petrified ham and
cheese croissant.
However, according to the Harvard Crim
son, the residents of the room plan to clean
the mess up in the near future because they
are "worried about bugs."
The Mexican Black Beetle had no com
ment.

The case of the doomed deli
It was two turkey sandwiches on hard rolls
with lettuce and pickles that did them in.
The case: an illegal deli operating out of a
Rutgers University dorm room.
The deli: The Late Night, offering a wide
variety of sandwiches, free mayo, mustard
and ketchup and $ 1 off every delivery that
takes longer than 25 minutes.

The investigating officer: Detective Joseph
Pagano, Rutgers University Police.
The operations of the Late Night Deli got
stung when they got the call to delive/ those
sandwiches to 5 Huntington Street.
The address: University Police
Headquarters.
Pagano said that he did not feel that the two
businessmen knew that they were in trouble
at the time of the call, "but I think they

plained.
