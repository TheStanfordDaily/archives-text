## It's 3 losses and out of 1st for Stanford Card falls into tie for second after surprising sweep by Trojans in L.A. 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — This weekend's three-game series
with USC was a rude awakening for the Stanford baseball
team.
The Cardinal, which on Friday was atop the Pacific 10
Conference's Southern Division by a game over UCLA,
dropped all three contests to USC, the Six-Pac's fifth
place team.
USC dealt Stanford a 10-7 loss here yesterday. That
game completed the sweep which began with Friday's 7-6
defeat and continued through Saturday's 7-2 rout.
Stanford, now 14-10 in league play, fell into a second
place tie with Arizona, also 14-10. The teams trail UCLA,
which took two of three games from Arizona over the
weekend, by a full game.
And to add insult to injury, it was the first time Stanford
had been swept in a three-game Six-Pac set in over two
years. Arizona State was the last team to whitewash the
Cardinal, accomplishing the feat in April 1984.
According to one USC player, though, it was only a
matter of time before Stanford, a team that in the early
going surprised more than a few, came down to earth.
"Not to take anything away from them," said USC des
ignated hitter Brian Brooks, "but I think they're probably
overrated. Their pitching has carried them this far, but
they have bad defense and don't hit the ball too well. I
think things are finally catching up to them."
To be fair, this weekend's version of the Stanford
baseball team didn't resemble the one that a week ago
swept a doubleheader from UCLA to retake the lead in
the Six-Pac.
The team's pitching, which even Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess admits is the key for the Cardinal, wasn't up to
snuff.
Yesterday, USC erupted for nine runs in the first three
frames against two Cardinal hurlers who shone on the
mound scarcely a week ago.
In the top of the first, right fielder Toi Cook drove in
Ruben Amaro with a two-out ground single into left to
stake starter Lee Plemel to a quick 1-0 lead.
But Stanford's right-hander, who beat UCLA last Mon
day, couldn't hold the advantage. After retiring the first
two batters in the bottom of the first, he ran into trouble.
Consecutive singles by first baseman Scott Sommers and
Brooks and a walk to second baseman Manny Anguilano
loaded the bases for Terry Brown.
The Trojans' right fielder dropped an end-of-the-bat
single into left field to plate USC's first two runs.
Things got worse for Plemel, 3-3 after the loss, in the
second. Catcher Brian Nichols doubled with one out and

came across when the next batter, Kevin Janik, lined a
two bagger to left-center field. Dan Henley, USC's
shortstop, then bounced an infield single to third.
With that Marquess decided to go to his bullpen — he
fetched Al Osuna, who saved the game for Plemel against
UCLA. This time the southpaw didn't fare so well. Like
Plemel, he left his out-pitch in the hotel room.
Osuna gave up consecutive RBI singles toSommers and
Brooks before escaping the inning. The score after two
complete: USC 5, Stanford 1.
The Cardinal managed two scores in the third. Amaro
walked and moved to third on Ron Witmeyer's ground
single into right field. Amaro scored and Witmeyerwent
to second on a passed ball.
Witmeyer advanced to third on a bounce out and came
across on Frank Carey's ground ball to shortstop.
Four runs in USC's half of the third turned the game

into a blowout. Pinch hitter Don Buford, who in 1985
transferred to USC from Stanford, tripled over Cook's
head in right. After Osuna got two strikeouts, Henley
blooped a run-scoring single to right-center field.
Sommers laid down a bunt single to set the stage for
Brooks. With runners on first and second and two out,
Brooks hit an Osuna slider off the scoreboard in right for
a three-run homer.
After the teams traded single tallies in the fourth, Stan
ford's comeback began in earnest.
The Cardinal rallied for a pair in the fifth. With one out,
Witmeyer bounced a double over Sommers' head at first
base. After a popout, Cook lined a RBI single into left.
Mark Davis followed with a line-drive single, sending
Cook to third. Cook came across when a balk was called

Stanford lost its grip on the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division lead last weekend when it was swept in a
three-game series by USC. Stanford has bounced back from adversity this season, but USC designated hitter
Brian Brooks doesn't think the Cardinal will be able to beat out Arizona or UCLA for the Six-Pac crown.
"They're probably overrated," he said. "Things are starting to catch up to them."
on USC's starting pitcher Rick
Weible, 2-1.
Against reliever Jim Wayne in the
sixth, pinch hitter Mark Machtolf
doubled off the wall in left to score
Carey, who had walked. Machtolfs
blast prompted USC Coach Rod
Dedeaux to call on Steve Bast, a left
hander who won Friday's opening
game.
Bast came in and got the final two
outs to end Stanford's threat in the
sixth, then went on to pitch 3-2/3 in
nings of hitless relief.
"I really wanted to beat them
today," said Bast, who earlier this
year lost a 3-2 decision to Stanford.
"It was kind of like 'Put it in their
face.' "
Everything was going according to
plan for Stanford in Friday's opener:
the team's ace, Jack McDowell, took
a two-run lead into the bottom of the
ninth. And just in case, Osuna, the
Cardinal's fireman, was ready in the
bullpen.
Besides, Stanford hadn't lost a
game all year in which it took a lead
into the ninth inning.
Then things started to happen.
Kaha Wong led off the inning with
a ground single into right field. The

next batter, Nichols was awarded first
base on a catcher's interference call.
Janik then doubled off the wall in
right center, driving in Wong and
sending Nichols to third. Nichols
scored the tying run and Janik went
to third on Henley's sacrifice fly to
right.
In came Osuna. After the left
hander walked Sommers intention
ally, Brooks drew a not-so
intentional free pass to load the
bases.
Osuna got Anguilano to pop up to
first for the second out, but then it
happened. Osuna plunked Brown on
the right shoulder, forcing home the
winning run.
McDowell, 9-3, suffered the loss.
Bast got the win, his sixth against five
defeats.
On Saturday, it was the John Reilly
show. The right-hander limited Stan
ford to three hits, walking three and
striking out four.
He allowed John Ramos' solo
home run in the first and another run
in the seventh, but that was it.
To back Reilly's effort, USC scored
two unearned runs in the first off
Kevin Kunkel, 4-4, another pair in
the third and a single run in the fifth.
In the seventh, bases-empty round
trippers by Janik and Brooks, the first
home runs on the year for both
players, made the score 7-2.
