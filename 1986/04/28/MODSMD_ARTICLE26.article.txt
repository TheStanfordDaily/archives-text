# Versatile Brooks wrecks the Cardinal with his bat, but his future is his arm
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — Everybody looks for an edge, a
little something that can help out in a pinch. Anything just
to get the upper hand.
Most people, though, spend a lifetime searching — and
without any luck. They're the ones who just blend in with
the crowd, never to make a name for themselves.
USC's Brian Brooks, from the Bay Area community of
Cerritos, is the rare one — he seems to have stumbled
upon a secret. And does it ever set him apart.
Brooks, the Trojans' designated hitter who batted in
the cleanup spot this weekend, seemed to know some
thing no one else did during USC's three-game sweep of
Stanford here.
The left-handed hitting junior collected seven hits in 13
plate appearances against the Cardinal's pitching staff,
blasted two round-trippers and knocked in six runs.
He was one step ahead of the game. His edge?
"I'm first and foremost a pitcher," Brooks said, "and
because of that, 1 like to think that I have a pretty good
idea what kind of pitch I'm going to get when I'm up there
hacking."
He had a very good idea what was coming in the third
inning of yesterday's game, won by USC 10-7. Brooks
pulled A 1 Osuna's first pitch to him over the right-field
fence for a three-run home run.
"It was a slider on the outside part of the plate, but it
was high. All I did was get the barrel of the bat on the ball
and away she went." Right off the scoreboard to stake
USC to a 9-3 lead.
He hit a similar pitch, a slider, from Kevin Kunkel for a
solo home run the day before during the Trojans' 7-1 win.
All this from a guy who came into the weekend with
more innings pitched (48-2/3) than at-bats (36). Brooks
had 15 hits before the Stanford series, but no home runs
and only four RBI.
After feasting on Stanford pitching, his average is up to
.471. That mark that would put him solidly in the lead for
the Pacific 10 Southern Division's batting championship
— if he had enough at-bats.
The scary part about the whole thing is that if Brooks
had his druthers, he wouldn't be swinging a bat at all.
He'd be sawing them off.
"Honestly, I'd rather throw the pill," Brooks, a right
hander who throws a 90 mile-per-hour fastball, said.
"Pitching has always been my first priority — it's my
future."
Brian Nichols, USC's catcher agrees: "He's got major
league stuff; all he has to work on is
his control. If he can do that, look
out."
Brooks, who did not pitch this
weekend but did warm up during Sat
urday's game, sports a 3-4 record and
a 7.03 ERA. In 48-2/3 innings of
work he has allowed only 43 hits but
walked 54.
"It's my first nature," Brooks said
of his pitching. "Hopefully, if I can
stay healthy and perfect my mechan
ics. it will take me places."
"He's a hell of a pitcher," Rod
Dedeaux, (JSC's coach for 37 years,

said. "It's been a hard sell, to get him
to hit. But, boy, can he hit."
For the veteran Dedeaux, though.
Brooks' versatility is nothing too new.
"We have a tradition of great guys
going both ways," he said. "I'm a big
believer in giving guys a chance to
show what they can do."
Dedeaux, who has led the Trojans
to 11 national titles, has given
chances to some big names in his day.
Dave Kingman, now with the Oak
land A's, and Fred Lynn, the Bal
timore Orioles' center fielder, both
began as pitchers at USC. Look
what's become of them.
And now Brooks has his chance .. .
