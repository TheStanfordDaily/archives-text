# Card dominates again at Ojai
## Third straight team title for Stanford 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
OJAI — The Ojai Intercollegiate is a tennis tourna
ment premised on tradition. Each year, orange juice is
served to the spectators in the morning and cookies and
tea served on gold-rimmed china in the afternoon. Each
year, the wealthy, elderly people of this quaint city pres
ent the trophies to the winners.
And in recent years, the Ojai sun has traditionally
shone brightly on Patty Fendick, Marianne Werdel and
the Stanford women's tennis team.
Yesterday, their good fortunes continued as Fendick
captured the Women's Intercollegiate Singles title, Wer
del won the Women's Invitational College Singles cham
pionship and the Cardinal brought home the team title at
the 87th annual Ojai Intercollegiate here at Libbey Park.
The Stanford doubles team of Cari Hagey and Stepha
nie Savides narrowly missed a title, losing in the finals of
the Women's Intercollegiate Doubles yesterday 7-5, 6-3
to USC's Dena Levy and Mary Norwood.
"We had a super Ojai," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said.
The Cardinal earned the Heffelfinger Trophy —
awarded to the team champion — for the third con
secutive year. Stanford scored 16 team points to edge
UCLA by two.
Fendick's appearance in the final was her third in as
many years at Stanford. As a freshman, she lost to
teammate Leigh Anne Eldredge, and last year she won
the Invitational College Singles.
After a shaky win Thursday, Fendick gathered herself
for two routine wins Friday over the University of the
Pacific's Trina Lee 6-3, 6-0 and San Diego State's Dana
Bleicher 6-4, 6-4.
At the same time, Eldredge rolled into the quarterfinals
with a 6-2, 6-0 morning win against UC-Santa Barbara's
Liz Costa and an afternoon 6-3, 6-2 victory.
Saturday, however, the competition suddenly became
more difficult, and Eldredge fell victim to the strong
baseline game of SDSU's Catherine Berry.
Berry's coach urged her to retire after the first few
games when blisters on her feet began to bother her. But
Berry refused to quit and fought to a 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 6-1
victory over Eldredge.
"Leigh Anne played very well except for the last set."
Brennan said.
Fendick's quarterfinal match was equally difficult. She
and Arizona's Jill Smoller, who had split two earlier
matches, divided the first two sets Saturday morning, with
Fendick winning the first 6-3 and Smoller rallying to take
the second 7-5.
In the decisive set, Fendick raced to a 4-0 lead and
finished off Smoller 6-1.
Fendick's semifinal match later in the day was markedly
easier. UCLA's Jennifer Fuchs was overwhelmed by her
serve, and the Stanford junior cruised to a 6-3. 6-2 vic
tory.
The Bruins' Patricia Hy. who had advanced to the finals
when Berry defaulted in their semifinal match, seemed
overmatched yesterday as Fendick took a 4-0 lead at the
beginning of the championship match.

For the third year in a row, Patty Fendick reached a final at the Ojai Intercollegiate, and
for the second consecutive year she won, routing UCLA's Patricia Hy 6-2, 6-4 to win the
Women's Intercollegiate Singles title. Teammate Marianne Werdel captured the Women's
Invitational College Singles crown, and Stanford won the team championship as well.
Fendick, however, knew not to get
overconfident. "She's just coming off
an injury," Fendick said. "I knew
she'd start slow."
Hy won the next two games to
come within 4-2, but Fendick
retaliated with two games of her own
to take the set 6-2.
Fendick appeared to be in trouble
in the second set after losing her serve
three times to fall behind 4-1, but she
didn't lose her confidence.
"I'm actually glad I got a chance to
come back," she said after the match.
And come back she did, to the tune
of winning the next five games and
the match 6-2, 6-4. A topspin shot at
the net sealed Fendick's champion
ship and also gave the Cardinal the
team victory.
"I think I've had a little trouble
with my confidence," Fendick said.
"This tournament really helped me.
I'm a lot more confident now."
Earlier yesterday morning, Werdel
completed her dominance of the
Women's Invitational College Singles
division with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over
UCLA's Jane Thomas.
The Cardinal freshman's only scare
came in Saturday's semifinal match
when SDSU's Monique Javer took

the first set 6-4.
Werdel rallied for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-0
victory, however, and completely
dominated Thomas in yesterday's
final.
"Last time I played her I lost,"
Werdel said. "This time I was going
to make sure I didn't."
Werdel, who has played in the
finals each year here since her
preteen years, concentrated on
keeping Thomas deep in the court
and coming to the net to finish off
points.
"If you can keep the ball hard and
deep, you can usually beat her," Wer
del said.
Werdel could not have hit the ball
much deeper or much harder yester
day, as Thomas' occasional screams
could attest.
"She hits the ball hard and accu
rate," Brennan said. "At one point,
she tattooed the line three times."
Thomas did break Werdel's serve
in the first game to take a 1-0 lead,
but the match was never close
thereafter.
Werdel broke Thomas three times
in the first set to win 6-2, employing
an effective combination of volleys
and groundstrokes.
Thomas tried to change the tempo
of the match in the second set by
coming to the net. But there she was

met by a plethora of Werdel passing
shots.
Werdel dropped just one game in
the second set en route to the victory.
"I was doing everything a lot bet
ter," she said.
Savides and Hagey did not lose any
sets — nor many games — in advanc
ing to the doubles final. But Levy and
Norwood were able to win most of
the critical points yesterday to repeat
as champions.

"I don't think our concentration
was there," Brennan said.
The Cardinal pair seemed to be on
the verge of a tie-breaker in the first
set as Hagey was up 3-0 on her serve.
A double-fault, however, sparked a
USC comeback, and the Trojans won
the game 4-3 and the set 7-5.
Hagey and Savides had many op
portunities in the second set, but the
scrappy Levy and Norwood held on
for a 6-3 win.
