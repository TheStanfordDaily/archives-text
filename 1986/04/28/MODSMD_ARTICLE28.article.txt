# Adjustments aid Fendick, Werdel

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
OJAI â€” The 1986 seasons of
Patty Fendick and Marianne Wer
del have been remarkably similar,
with yesterday's victories here at
the Ojai Intercollegiate being the
most recent chapters.
Great things were expected
from both prior to the season.
Fendick, who had been labeled by
one tennis magazine as the 1985
Player to Watch, reached the
NCAA semifinals last season and
was No. 4 in the preseason

rankings this year.
Werdel was the country's top
recruited freshman after compiling
an almost unbelievable junior
record.
And then a strange thing hap
pened. When the dual match
season rolled around at the begin
ning of February, Fendick started
to lose. Werdel lost even more fre
quently.
"I was losing to people I had
never lost to." said Werdel, whose
dual match record dipped as low

Marianne Werdel may have a leg up on her now, but don't be
surprised if Patty Fendick has the last laugh at the NCAA singles
tournament in May. Both Fendick and Werdel were champions
last weekend in Ojai.
