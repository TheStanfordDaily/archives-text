# Adjustments aid Fendick, Werdel

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
OJAI — The 1986 seasons of
Patty Fendick and Marianne Wer
del have been remarkably similar,
with yesterday's victories here at
the Ojai Intercollegiate being the
most recent chapters.
Great things were expected
from both prior to the season.
Fendick, who had been labeled by
one tennis magazine as the 1985
Player to Watch, reached the
NCAA semifinals last season and
was No. 4 in the preseason

rankings this year.
Werdel was the country's top
recruited freshman after compiling
an almost unbelievable junior
record.
And then a strange thing hap
pened. When the dual match
season rolled around at the begin
ning of February, Fendick started
to lose. Werdel lost even more fre
quently.
"I was losing to people I had
never lost to." said Werdel, whose
dual match record dipped as low

tournament in May. Both Fendick and Werdel were champions
last weekend in Ojai.
as 3-5.
Fendick complained about the
early-season rainouts which were
keeping her from becoming
"match tough."
Werdel found that the academic
demands of college were biting
into her training time, and the
sharpness of her game suffered.
She was also adjusting to the
pressure associated with playing
on a team. On the junior tour, she
played for herself. If she lost, she
had let herself down. At Stanford,
if she lost, she was letting the team
down.
After two early-season losses at
Arizona and Arizona State, Fen
dick started to play better — but
not against the top players.
"I've had good matches, but
against not as good players," she
said.
Fendick lost to nemesis
Gretchen Rush of Trinity in
March. On April 4, USC's
Caroline Kuhlman took her in
straight sets. On April 19,
Kuhlman beat her again, handing
Fendick her first loss at Stanford
since she was a freshman.
Recent switches, however,
seemed to have brought Fendick
and Werdel back to the top of the
college tennis world. Fendick has
changed to a new racket, Werdel
to a new style.
Fendick's new Wilson racket
has given her a "psychological
edge," according to Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan.
Werdel has started to come to

the net more often when oppo
nents hit short approach shots.
"I've worked on my volleys a lot
more," she said yesterday.
The result has been the Werdel
that everybody expected to see out
of high school. She swept USCs
Heliane Steden on April 19 at
Stanford. Steden is the nation's
fourth-ranked singles player.
Werdel demolished UCLA's
Jane Thomas here yesterday 6-2,
6-1 to win the Women's Invita
tional College Singles champion
ship. She was so overwhelming
that even the normally loud
mouthed Thomas was reduced to
occasional moans and groans.
In winning the Women's Inter
collegiate Singles title, Fendick
beat a field that, even without
Kuhlman, was talented. "Here I
had to beat good players," she
said. And she did.
With yesterday's victories se
cured, both Fendick and Werdel
are eyeing the national singles
championship.
"I feel I'm getting stronger as I
go along," Fendick said.
"I'm confident," Werdel said.
"There's only three people in col
lege I've lost to before this year,
and I've beaten all of them before.
"I don't think Rush will win it
this year," added Werdel, who
twice defeated Kuhlman last sum
mer.
One certainty is that after all
Fendick and Werdel have been
through this season, nothing will
faze them from here on out.
"She's been through it all,"
Brennan said of Werdel.
The same can be said of Fen
dick.

to a new style.
Fendick's new Wilson racket
has given her a "psychological
edge," according to Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan.
Werdel has started to come to

the net more often when oppo
nents hit short approach shots.
"I've worked on my volleys a lot
more," she said yesterday.
The result has been the Werdel
that everybody expected to see out
of high school. She swept USCs
Heliane Steden on April 19 at
Stanford. Steden is the nation's
fourth-ranked singles player.
Werdel demolished UCLA's
Jane Thomas here yesterday 6-2,
6-1 to win the Women's Invita
tional College Singles champion
ship. She was so overwhelming
that even the normally loud
mouthed Thomas was reduced to
occasional moans and groans.
In winning the Women's Inter
collegiate Singles title, Fendick
beat a field that, even without
Kuhlman, was talented. "Here I
had to beat good players," she
said. And she did.
With yesterday's victories se
cured, both Fendick and Werdel
are eyeing the national singles
championship.
"I feel I'm getting stronger as I
go along," Fendick said.
"I'm confident," Werdel said.
"There's only three people in col
lege I've lost to before this year,
and I've beaten all of them before.
"I don't think Rush will win it
this year," added Werdel, who
twice defeated Kuhlman last sum
mer.
One certainty is that after all
Fendick and Werdel have been
through this season, nothing will
faze them from here on out.
"She's been through it all,"
Brennan said of Werdel.
The same can be said of Fen
dick.
