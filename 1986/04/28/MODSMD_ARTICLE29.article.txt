# McEnroe ousted in Pac-10 semis
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
OJAI — Of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's best men's tennis teams, only
UCLA brought a full, healthy squad
to this weekend's league champion
ships here at Libbey Park. By the end
of the tournament yesterday, the
Bruins had made the most of this ad
vantage, capturing the Thacher Cup,
which is awarded to the team cham
pion each year.
UCLA dominated the field, scoring
13 team points. California edged out
Stanford and USC for second place
with nine points. The defending
champion Cardinal and the Trojans,
without Kick Leach, the nation's top
singles player, each tallied eight
points.
Stanford didn't figure to defend its
1985 team title successfully from the
outset. Neither Dan Goldie, the
defending conference singles and
doubles champion, nor Jim Grabb,
the Cardinal's No. 2 singles palyer,
made the trip due to injuries.
Despite its disappointing third
place finish, Stanford received strong
showings from junior Scott Moody
and sophomore Patrick McEnroe.
Moody upset Cal's No. I singles
player, Steve DeVries, 1-6, 7-6, 7-6
in Thursday's second round, playing
what he called the best tennis of his
college career.
In Friday's quarterfinal match.
Moody never could get his net game
on track. USC's John Carras passed
him with powerful groundstrokes to
take the first set 6-0.
Moody appeared to be back in the
match after breaking Carras' serve
twice at the outset of the second set to
take a 3-0 advantage. But his un
forced errors mounted and Carras
won six of the next seven games to
capture the set and match, 6-0, 6-4.
On the adjacent court, McEnroe
was soundly defeating a helpless
Luke Jensen of USC, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1
to advance to the semifinals. The ease
of McEnroe's victory was surprising,
as only a week earlier, Jensen had
defeated him 6-3, 6-4 in Los Angeles.
McEnroe forced the action
throughout the match, coming to the
net as often as possible. Jensen, who
usually controls the net during his
matches, became more and more
frustrated as McEnroe picked off vir
tually all of his passing shot attempts.
The first set went to a tie-breaker
after Jensen rallied from a 5-2 deficit.

With the score 4-4 in the tie-breaker,
McEnroe held his serve and then
broke Jensen twice to capture the set.
The USC freshman held his serve
to take a 1-0 lead in the second set
but then became a victim of a Mac at
tack — a barrage of McEnroe
groundstrokes and volleys.
Trailing 3-1 in the second game,
McEnroe was able to hold his serve
and then break Jensen in a love game.
Two games later, McEnroe broke
Jensen again to take a 4-1 lead. By
this time, Jensen was beginning to
wonder aloud whether he was playing
Patrick or John McEnroe.
Jensen may not have been the only
one wondering. In the sixth game of
the set, McEnroe landed two volleys
on the baseline and then followed

with an ace to take a 5-1 lead.
One more break of Jensen's serve
gave McEnroe the set and the match.
Saturday's semifinal match be
tween McEnroe and UCLA's Brad
Pearce brought a capacity crowd to
the courts. McEnroe, however, didn't
bring his serve.
The previous day he had been able
to keep Jensen off of the net by con
sistently landing his first serve. But
Saturday, McEnroe's first serve failed
him, and Pearce feasted on his second
serve to move into the finals with a 6-
2, 7-5 victory.
"He just didn't serve as well
today," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said, explaining the difference be
tween McEnroe's matches against
Pearce and Jensen. "Pearce played

very, very well today. He returned
great."
Pearce, the nation's No. 2 singles
piayer, had to survive a McEnroe
comeback in the second set before he
could advance to the finals.
Trailing 4-0, McEnroe won five
consecutive games. But Pearce
regrouped to capture the next three
games and the match.
"He (McEnroe) did a nice job of
staying in the match," Gould said.
"He is a great competitor."
In Sunday's all-UCLA final,
Pearce defeated teammate Michael
Kures 6-4, 6-2.
McEnroe's semifinal loss Saturday
ended the Cardinal's stay here.
Friday, all three Stanford doubles
teams had been eliminated.

Patrick McEnroe's devastating performance in the quarterfinals of the Pacific 10 Conference singles tourna
ment had USC freshman Luke Jensen asking the crowd which McEnroe, Patrick or John, he was up against.
After he disposed of Jensen 7-6, 6-1, McEnroe's first serve deserted him in the semifinals, which he lost 6-2,
7-5 to UCLA's Brad Pearce, the eventual champion.
