Members of Stanford Out of South Africa (SOS A) have
vowed to "build a shanty a day" until the Stanford Board
of Trustees agrees to publicly discuss full divestment from
South African-related companies in next month's
meeting, but University President Donald Kennedy said
Saturday that the shanties built outside his office will have
no effect on his views or those of the trustees.
Last week SOS A members constructed three of the
wooden shacks, which symbolize of the economic condi
tions of blacks living under apartheid in South Africa,
outside Kennedy's Building 10 office.
Kennedy, who was out of town during the initial con
struction. told The Daily, "We continue to listen to well
thought out opinions, but this sort of thing has no impact
whatsoever."
"(The University has) tried to take a broad-minded at
titude about expressions of opinion on campus, (but) the
shanties' present location will be nothing like indefinite,"
he said.
He declined to comment on SOSA's plans to build
more shanties but said the University will issue a response
to the group's demands early this week.
SOSA members nave demanded that the University
divest from all South Africa-related stockholdings and
have cited the recent approval of a student divestment ref
erendum by a two-thirds majority as supportive of their
demands.
SOSA has also demanded that the trustees issue a
definitive statement on their policies on divestment after
their May 12 meeting, and have demanded that the
meeting be made open to the public.
"The University has refused to address the basic
demands (of the students)," SOSA
member Mike Schmitz said yester
day. "This is a reflection of the stance
the University is taking on the issue.
Our impression is that they will not
act until we increase student pressure
in one form or another."

Schmitz said that the shanties will
be built by volunteers from various
student residences.
"This public embarrassment could
make (the University) take a stand,
make them address the problem," he
said.
Residents from Theta Chi and
Roble Hall have already committed
to the project, Schmitz said.
