# BYU wins 18th straight at home
## Golfers cannot weather Cougars 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Hail and snow in Provo, Utah, proved to have a
definite chilling effect on the Stanford men's golf
team.
With four players at par midway through the
second round of the Cougar Classic, play was
suspended because of a hailstorm. Although Stan
ford began to come back in the final round, the
Cardinal had to settle for fifth place out of 12 teams
with a score of 1,113.
"I thought we played very well the last day,"
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said. "(The middle
round) was suspended by hail. We didn't do very
well after that.
"We had four guys at par when play was
stopped," Schaaf said. "We had a chance at a good
round but it didn't materialize."
"I didn't think (Stanford's performance) was
very good," Stanford's Don Walsworth said. "We
were definitely the second-best team there. I think
it was a little disappointing."

Host Brigham Young won for the 18th year in a
row, this time with ease as it defeated New Mexico
by 17 strokes (1,077-1,094). BYU was led by Steve
Schneiter, who defeated New Mexico's John Kienie
in a playoff to win the individual crown. Another
Cougar, Bruce Bockbank, finished third, one
stroke behind the pair, at 210.
"They're a very good team," Schaaf said about
BYU. "One of the reasons we play there ... is to
beat them there is as tough as winning any tourna
ment there is."
Stanford itself has a history of finishing strongly
in its home tournaments, but while Stanford's tour
naments usually have had very challenging fields,
both Schaaf and Walsworth both indicated that for
many years of its winning streak BYU did not
invite the strongest competition.
"They kind of protect themselves a little bit,"
Walsworth said.
Utah and Nevada-Las Vegas were the other two
teams ahead of Stanford, finishing at 1,101 and
1,105, respectively. Rounding out the top 10 were
Oral Roberts, California, Colorado, Nebraska and
Weber State.

Walsworth led Stanford's golfers with a 219, on
73-72-74 shooting, which piu him in 12th place
among individuals.
"I thought (my performance) was fair — pretty
good, but it wasn't like I wanted it to be,"
Walsworth said. "1 haven't played up to my expec
tations this year. ... In your senior year you kind
of expect to do better."
Carl Wagner shot even par 72 in the first and
third rounds, ending up at 221, while John Dickey
filled the gap with a second round 72, finishing at
222.
Phil Rowley shot an 80 in the second round, but
came back in the third round despite snowfall to
shoot a 72 and finish at 227. Roger Miraglia and
Rich Marik deadlocked at 231.
Stanford doesn't get much of a break between
tournaments, as the team leaves tomorrow afternoon
for Phoenix and the Sun Devil Intercollegiate,
which will be May 1-3. This will be the Cardinal's
last tournament before Pacific 10 Conference
tournament, which begins May 5 — only two days
later.
