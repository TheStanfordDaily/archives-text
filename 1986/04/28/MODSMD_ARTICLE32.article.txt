# Hot third round moves Card up to 5th at Pac-West
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
It was a matter of too little, too
late for the Stanford women's golf
team, as it finished in fifth place in
the Pac-West Championships in
Tucson, Ariz., despite shooting just
two-over-par as a team in the final
round.
The Cardinal shot 294 on the
par-73 Tucson National Golf
Course yesterday, but still finished
nine strokes behind fourth-place
Arizona at 928.
USC, tied with Arizona State
after 54 holes at 903, became Pac-
West Conference champions by
winning a playoff. UCLA finished
third at 917, two strokes ahead of
Arizona.
Stanford opened play yesterday
17 strokes behind Arizona, but got
excellent individual rounds from
four players to close the gap.
"We had a great day today,"
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said
yesterday.
Senior Julie Carmichael shot a
one-under par 72 in the final
round, which enabled her to tie for
fifth among all individuals in the
Pac-West. Behind her were Kathy
Kostas, Kay Cornelius and
Adrienne Gilmartin, each with
scores of 7 4.
Gilmartin's round was espe
cially noteworthy, as she fired a 32
on the final nine holes of the
round to set a new Stanford
record. Kathleen McCarthy, who
missed this tournament due to
chicken pox, holds Stanford's 18-

hole record — a five-under-par
68.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal did
not find its groove in the first two
days of the tournament, shooting
319 on Friday and 315 Saturday.
"The team just did not perform
well at all," Baldwin said. "Other
than Julie Carmichael and Kathy
Kostas, the other three players
played very poorly the first two
days. Apparently, we finally got
used to the course."
Carmichael tied with USC's
Kim Lasken and UCLA's Kay
Lockeri at 227, with Kostas finish
ing two strokes behind them at
227. Cornelius wound up the tour
ney at 235, while Gilmartin
finished at 243. Trish McGonigle
rounded out Stanford's scores at
245.
ASU's Pam Wright shot par on
the first playoff hole to break a tie
with UCLA's Kristal Parker at
223 and win the individual cham
pionship. Arizona's Kris Hoos
finished on their heels in third
place at 224, while ASU's Pearl
Sinn and Arizona's Cathryn Imrie
knotted in fourth place at 225.
Despite its disappointing finish
in the Pac-West, Stanford's season
is not over yet. While official
rankings are not due out for 10
days, Baldwin expects the Card
inal to be seeded about eighth in
the NCAA Championship tourna
ment, which is being hosted by
Ohio State May 28-31.
Baldwin added that McCarthy
should be back and ready to play
when the team travels to
Colombus.
