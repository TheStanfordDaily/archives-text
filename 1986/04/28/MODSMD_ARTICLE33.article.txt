# Swimmers sign eight

Faced with the loss of graduating
seniors John Moffet, Dave Lundberg
and Mike Reynolds, the Stanford
men's swimming team, two-time
defending NCAA champion, has
signed a group of recruits it hopes will
keep the Cardinal in the NCAA title
chase during the next four years.
The most difficult man to replace
will obviously be Moffet, a five-time
NCAA winner who never lost a dual
match race in his Stanford career.
Moffet won the 200-yard NCAA
breaststroke three times and the 100
breaststroke twice, with only a .15-
second upset loss to UCLA's
Giovanni Minervini preventing him
from becoming a three-time cham
pion in that race as well.
The man Stanford hopes will
assume Moffet's role as top
breaststroker is Sam Schwartz of Mill
Valley, the nation's No. 1 high school
swimmer in the event this year.
"We need a good breaststroker,"
Stanford Recruiting Coordinator
Dave Sims said.
"He'll be right in there for the top
(breaststroke) spot," junior Mike
Meyer said.
The Cardinal also helped itself in
Meyer's specialty, the distance
freestyle events, signing five swim
mers who participated in these
events. Two of these swimmers, Hank
Wise of Long Beach and John
Witchel of New York, N.Y., swim
other races as well. Wise also com
petes in the 400-yard individual med
ley, while Johnson races in the back
stroke events.
The other three distance freestylers
are Lunn Lestina of Fairfax, Va., Ken
Johnson of Tucson, Ariz, and Ricky
Gould, son of Stanford tennis Coach
Dick Gould.
Stanford also signed Byron Bursen
of Garland, Texas, the nation's top
high school individual medley swim
mer, and butterflierand breaststroker
Brad Axel of Muscatin, lowa.
