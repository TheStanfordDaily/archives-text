# Dukes sets two career highs at Mt. Sac Relays
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Overall, it wasn't a very good weekend for the Stan
ford track team, but for senior Pam Dukes it was one
of the best of her career.
At this weekend's Mt. Sac Relays in Walnut, a small
Cardinal contingent was beset by nagging injuries and
lackluster performances. Coach Brooks Johnson was
interested in the competition mainly as a warmup for
next week's dual meet with California, and it showed.
A few of the 13 athletes that went to the meet chose
to rest their injuries, and the remaining competitors
were unable to place in Mt. Sac's tough field. All of
them, that is, except Dukes, who threw her personal
best in both the shotput and the discus.
On Saturday Dukes won the discus with a throw of
176-feet-l, and on Sunday she returned to capture
fourth in the shotput with a heave of 56-8, a throw
which moved her up to fourth on the NCAA all-time
list.
It sounds like it was a perfect weekend for Dukes,
but it wasn't quite that easy. After her first three

throws in the shotput, Dukes wasn't sure that she was
going to make the finals, and she wasn't too pleased.
"I was almost hysterical. I began to lose my confi
dence. I thought, My God, I'm not going to make the
finals,' " she said. "The shot is my primary event, so if I
didn't make it to the finals, the win in the discus
wouldn't really have mattered."
But luckily for Dukes, she did make it to the finals
and from there she took off. "I talked to my coach and
found out that I was doing only one thing wrong,'" she
said. "After that it was like two different throwers.
First it was the freshman Dukes and then it was the
senior Dukes."
The senior Dukes' throw was a scant three inches off
Carol Cady's school record of 56-11, a mark which
could fall any time. Dukes has steadily progressed all
season, and is now looking past the record toward a
possible NCAA Championship.
If things go as they have so far this season, Dukes
primary competition for the crown will come from
Rice's Regina Cavanaugh, who placed third, just ahead
of Dukes in Sunday's competition.
