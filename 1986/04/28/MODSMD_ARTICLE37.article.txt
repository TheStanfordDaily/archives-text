Afghan political leadership tenuous
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Uncertainty over the political leadership
of Afghanistan deepened yesterday as President Babrak Karmal failed
to give a traditional address at anniversary celebrations of the commu
nist takeover of the country eight yeans ago.
Kabul radio, monitored here, mentioned Babrak's name only once
during a live broadcast of the capital's military parade celebrating the
anniversary of the Afghan communist coup d'etat. The radio failed to
state whether Babrak was at the parade, an omission that sparked new
questions about his whereabouts since his reported departure for Mos
cow on March 30.
Western diplomats here have suggested that Babrak, 57, may be re
ceiving medical treatment in the Soviet Union for an unspecified lung
ailment. But an article in yesterday's editions of the official Soviet Com
munist Party newspaper Pravda appeared to criticize Babrak's leader
ship, intensifying speculation that the Soviets are displeased with Babrak
and may remove him.
The latest signals of Soviet displeasure come before the scheduled
opening May 5 of a new round of indirect talks under U.N. auspices be
tween Pakistan and Afghanistan to focus on terms for a Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan and an end to Pakistani and U.S. support
for Afghan rebels. It was not clear what effect Babrak's disappearance
would have on the talks. If they are successful, a key question would be
the nature of the government in Kabul once Soviet forces leave.
During the past year, diplomats often have questioned whether
Babrak might be falling out of favor in Moscow. Those observers note
that the Soviet-dominated Afghan govertiment has shifted its strategy
for generating popular support and that factions within the ruling com
munist party have continued a longstanding feud that involves assassina
tions of rival officials.
"There is no question that the Soviets are unhappy," a State Depart
ment expert on the region said Sunday in Washington,"and they may be
looking for alternative leadership to be more effective in Kabul."
Last week. Afghan Prime Minister Soltan Ali Keshtmand, formally
the country's number two leader, received an unusually warm reception
and wide Soviet media coverage during a visit to Moscow. Keshtmand
and the former Afghan secret police chief, Najibullah, are generally re
garded as the most likely successors to Babrak.
The Soviet Union installed Babrak as president of Afghanistan shortly
after it invaded the country in December 1979, to replace the collapsing
communist government of Hafizullah Amin. Babrak remains in power
with the support of about 1 15,000 Soviet troops who lead the fight
against a broad Moslem resistance movement.
British tourist killed in Jerusalem
JERUS ALEM — A 28-year-old British tourist was shot to death yes
terday outside a Christian holy site and an Israeli leader denounced the
murder as an attempt by terrorists to scare away vistors.
It was the third shooting of a tourist in six weeks in predominantly
Arab east Jerusalem. The two other victims survived.
Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy said Paul Appleby of Brison
was shot once in the back of the head with a small caliber pistol near the
Garden Tomb shrine, revered by some Protestants as the hilltop where
Jesus was crucified and buried.
Levy said Appleby came to Israel a month ago and was living in a
rented apartment in Jerusalem with friends.
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the shooting the work of ter
rorists and pledged that Israel would fight terrorism until "we put an end
to it."
He said the attack was meant to frighten visitors and undermine
tourism, an important source of income to Israel.
Police sources said investigators were trying to determine if the attack
was intended as retaliation against the British for allowing U.S.
warplanes to use English bases for the April 15 air raids on Libya.
But Prime Minister Shimon Peres said he doubted the gunman knew
his victim was British.
Appleby was shot in an isolated alleyway outside the Garden Tomb
that is administered by a British-based foundation. He may not have
known that the tomb, unlike most Christian shrines in the city, is closed
to visitors on Sundays.
Police discover IRA's explosives
BELFAST. Ireland — Police said yesterday that they found 800
pounds of explosives packed in milk churns in the area where Irish Re
publican Army fugitive Seamus McElwainewas killed by British soldiers
the day before.
They also reported a telephoned tip led them to a car packed with 475
pounds of explosives and parked two blocks from where a Protestant
march was scheduled to pass by in downtown Belfast. The explosives
were defused and there were no violent incidents during the march.
Police were out in force for the march because of rioting Saturday
night in three cities, with both Roman Catholic and Protestant militants
attacking police patrols.
Nine officers were wounded, including one whose face was badly
slashed, police said.
In the Irish Republic, gunmen of the outlawed IRA fired volleys in a
salute over the coffin of McElwaine, a convicted double murderer whose
body was returned to his home village of Scotstown Saturday night.
McElwaine's coffin, followed by a 70-car cortege, was taken to
Scotstown about 16 hours after he was killed by soldiers in a gun battle
in the village of Rosslea, 55 miles from Belfast and on the border with
the Irish Republic.
Police said the milk churns containing the explosives were found in a
ditch near where McElwaine was slain.
British press reports said McElwaine was killed and another guerrilla,
identified as Kevin Lynch, was shot in the stomach and captured as they
were preparing a roadside bomb. Police said the wounded man was in
fair condition.
McElwaine had been given a life sentence for the 1980 killings of a
soldier and a reserve policeman in this British province.
He and 37 other other prisoners escaped in September 1983 from
Belfast's Maze penitentiary, a top security facility that holds some of
Northern Ireland's most dangerous guerrillas. All but 12 were
recaptured.
Violence continues in Persian Gulf
B AGHDAD. Iraq — Iraqi jets set a small Iranian oil tanker ablaze in
the northern Persian Gulf early yesterday as Iranian fighter-bombers at
tacked Iraqi military positions in the Faw Peninsula near the Kuwaiti
border.
Lloyds of London said the 16.800-ton Minab. owned by the national
Iranian tanker company, was hit about 50 miles south of the main
Iranian export terminal at Kharg Island. There was no immediate word
on casualties.
Iran said its warplanes raided Iraqi fortifications along the Faw-Bihar
and the Faw-Um Qasr roads, "killing large numbers of enemy soldiers
and leaving the area under a thick cloud of smoke."
Iran said its ground forces raided Iraqi positions in the southern oil
rich Majnoon islands, killing "tens'" of Iraqi soldiers, capturing three
others and setting two boats ablaze.
Iraq reported a day earlier recapturing "important areas ' during a
seven-hour offensive in Majnoon, which has been partially occupied by
the Iranians since 1983. The Iraqis said at least 1.950 Iranians had been
killed in the attack.
Iraq said its warplanes bombed the Kharg Island terminal later in the
day and reported a flurry of ground activity on the occasion of President
Saddam Hussein's 49th birthday.

salute over the coffin of McElwaine, a convicted double murderer whose
body was returned to his home village of Scotstown Saturday night.
McElwaine's coffin, followed by a 70-car cortege, was taken to
Scotstown about 16 hours after he was killed by soldiers in a gun battle
in the village of Rosslea, 55 miles from Belfast and on the border with
the Irish Republic.
Police said the milk churns containing the explosives were found in a
ditch near where McElwaine was slain.
British press reports said McElwaine was killed and another guerrilla,
identified as Kevin Lynch, was shot in the stomach and captured as they
were preparing a roadside bomb. Police said the wounded man was in
fair condition.
McElwaine had been given a life sentence for the 1980 killings of a
soldier and a reserve policeman in this British province.
He and 37 other other prisoners escaped in September 1983 from
Belfast's Maze penitentiary, a top security facility that holds some of
Northern Ireland's most dangerous guerrillas. All but 12 were
recaptured.
Violence continues in Persian Gulf
B AGHDAD. Iraq — Iraqi jets set a small Iranian oil tanker ablaze in
the northern Persian Gulf early yesterday as Iranian fighter-bombers at
tacked Iraqi military positions in the Faw Peninsula near the Kuwaiti
border.
Lloyds of London said the 16.800-ton Minab. owned by the national
Iranian tanker company, was hit about 50 miles south of the main
Iranian export terminal at Kharg Island. There was no immediate word
on casualties.
Iran said its warplanes raided Iraqi fortifications along the Faw-Bihar
and the Faw-Um Qasr roads, "killing large numbers of enemy soldiers
and leaving the area under a thick cloud of smoke."
Iran said its ground forces raided Iraqi positions in the southern oil
rich Majnoon islands, killing "tens'" of Iraqi soldiers, capturing three
others and setting two boats ablaze.
Iraq reported a day earlier recapturing "important areas ' during a
seven-hour offensive in Majnoon, which has been partially occupied by
the Iranians since 1983. The Iraqis said at least 1.950 Iranians had been
killed in the attack.
Iraq said its warplanes bombed the Kharg Island terminal later in the
day and reported a flurry of ground activity on the occasion of President
Saddam Hussein's 49th birthday.
Afghan political leadership tenuous
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Uncertainty over the political leadership
of Afghanistan deepened yesterday as President Babrak Karmal failed
to give a traditional address at anniversary celebrations of the commu
nist takeover of the country eight yeans ago.
Kabul radio, monitored here, mentioned Babrak's name only once
during a live broadcast of the capital's military parade celebrating the
anniversary of the Afghan communist coup d'etat. The radio failed to
state whether Babrak was at the parade, an omission that sparked new
questions about his whereabouts since his reported departure for Mos
cow on March 30.
Western diplomats here have suggested that Babrak, 57, may be re
ceiving medical treatment in the Soviet Union for an unspecified lung
ailment. But an article in yesterday's editions of the official Soviet Com
munist Party newspaper Pravda appeared to criticize Babrak's leader
ship, intensifying speculation that the Soviets are displeased with Babrak
and may remove him.
The latest signals of Soviet displeasure come before the scheduled
opening May 5 of a new round of indirect talks under U.N. auspices be
tween Pakistan and Afghanistan to focus on terms for a Soviet troop
withdrawal from Afghanistan and an end to Pakistani and U.S. support
for Afghan rebels. It was not clear what effect Babrak's disappearance
would have on the talks. If they are successful, a key question would be
the nature of the government in Kabul once Soviet forces leave.
During the past year, diplomats often have questioned whether
Babrak might be falling out of favor in Moscow. Those observers note
that the Soviet-dominated Afghan govertiment has shifted its strategy
for generating popular support and that factions within the ruling com
munist party have continued a longstanding feud that involves assassina
tions of rival officials.
"There is no question that the Soviets are unhappy," a State Depart
ment expert on the region said Sunday in Washington,"and they may be
looking for alternative leadership to be more effective in Kabul."
Last week. Afghan Prime Minister Soltan Ali Keshtmand, formally
the country's number two leader, received an unusually warm reception
and wide Soviet media coverage during a visit to Moscow. Keshtmand
and the former Afghan secret police chief, Najibullah, are generally re
garded as the most likely successors to Babrak.
The Soviet Union installed Babrak as president of Afghanistan shortly
after it invaded the country in December 1979, to replace the collapsing
communist government of Hafizullah Amin. Babrak remains in power
with the support of about 1 15,000 Soviet troops who lead the fight
against a broad Moslem resistance movement.
British tourist killed in Jerusalem
JERUS ALEM — A 28-year-old British tourist was shot to death yes
terday outside a Christian holy site and an Israeli leader denounced the
murder as an attempt by terrorists to scare away vistors.
It was the third shooting of a tourist in six weeks in predominantly
Arab east Jerusalem. The two other victims survived.
Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy said Paul Appleby of Brison
was shot once in the back of the head with a small caliber pistol near the
Garden Tomb shrine, revered by some Protestants as the hilltop where
Jesus was crucified and buried.
Levy said Appleby came to Israel a month ago and was living in a
rented apartment in Jerusalem with friends.
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir called the shooting the work of ter
rorists and pledged that Israel would fight terrorism until "we put an end
to it."
He said the attack was meant to frighten visitors and undermine
tourism, an important source of income to Israel.
Police sources said investigators were trying to determine if the attack
was intended as retaliation against the British for allowing U.S.
warplanes to use English bases for the April 15 air raids on Libya.
But Prime Minister Shimon Peres said he doubted the gunman knew
his victim was British.
Appleby was shot in an isolated alleyway outside the Garden Tomb
that is administered by a British-based foundation. He may not have
known that the tomb, unlike most Christian shrines in the city, is closed
to visitors on Sundays.
Police discover IRA's explosives
BELFAST. Ireland — Police said yesterday that they found 800
pounds of explosives packed in milk churns in the area where Irish Re
publican Army fugitive Seamus McElwainewas killed by British soldiers
the day before.
They also reported a telephoned tip led them to a car packed with 475
pounds of explosives and parked two blocks from where a Protestant
march was scheduled to pass by in downtown Belfast. The explosives
were defused and there were no violent incidents during the march.
Police were out in force for the march because of rioting Saturday
night in three cities, with both Roman Catholic and Protestant militants
attacking police patrols.
Nine officers were wounded, including one whose face was badly
slashed, police said.
