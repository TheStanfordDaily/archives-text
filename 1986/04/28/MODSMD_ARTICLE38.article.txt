# Meeting a target, says Shultz
## 
### 
HONOLULU — The forthcoming
economic summit meeting provides
"a very juicy target for terrorists,"
and every precaution is being taken
to prevent any terrorist act when
President Reagan and the leaders of
six other democracies meet in Tokyo,
Secretary of State George Shultz said
yesterday.
Expressing concern about the
necessity for implementing tight se
curity measures to combat increasing
acts of terrorism, Shultz said that he
would be even more concerned "if we
didn't have the common sense to
protect ourselves."
"And we're doing that — at home
and abroad," he declared in a televi
sion interview. "And naturally, when
you get the heads of state of the seven
industrialized democracies gathered
together, it's a very juicy target for
terrorists."

As Reagan. Shultz and other mem
ber of the presidential party prepared
to leave here this morning for a three
day visit in Indonesia before proceed
ing to Tokyo for the May 4-6 summit,
terrorism continued to dominate dis
cussions almost to the exclusion of
other issues.
Shultz, interviewed on CBS-TV's
"Face the Nation," predicted that at
the economic summit the heads of
state will agree unanimously on the
importance of having a strategy and
tactical ability to implement strong
measures against terrorism.
The summit brings together the
heads of state of the United States,
Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Italy
and West Germany.
Administration officials had ex
pressed disappointment when only
the British government among the
Western allies gave strong support to
the I TnitpH States for its April 15 raid

on what Washington called terrorist
targets in Libya. But Shultz said
European governments now recog
nize the threat of terrorism "as
clearly as we do" and pointed out that
some of them have begun reducing
the sizes of Libyan Embassy staffs
suspected of being the source of ter
rorism.
However, the attack on Libya has
been extremely unpopular in Britain
as well as in other European
countries and has also been sharply
criticized in Southeast Asia, where
Reagan will be spending the next
three days.
The president has said he hopes the
bombing will not adversely affect
U.S. relations with the six members
of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations — Indonesia, Thailand,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore
and Brunei.

During his stay in Bali, Indonesia,
Reagan will meet with Indonesian
President Suharto and confer with the
foreign ministers of the ASEAN
countries.
Shultz, in his CBS appearance, em
phasized that the administration
believes that it needs to be able to act
in greater secrecy in the future in
combatting terrorism. Asked about
his statement Friday in an interview
that covert action should be consid
ered as a means of undermining
Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy's regime, he said:
"Covert action is something that
we need to be using . . . there are a
great many things that need to be
done secretly, and we have to have a
greater capacity in our country to rec
ognize the importance of being able
to do things without having them
publicized ahead of time."
