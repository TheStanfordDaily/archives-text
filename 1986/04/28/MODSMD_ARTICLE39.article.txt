# Marcos hopes to go home

HONOLULU and MANILA, Philippines — In
an emotional phone call between two old friends,
deposed Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos
told President Reagan that he wanted to return to
the Philippines to take his place as the legitimate
leader of his country, White House sources said.
But Reagan, while expressing sympathy for
Marcos, "said nothing to encourage him," the
sources said, and reiterated official U.S. support for
Corazon Aquino as president of the Philippines.
Marcos' wife, Imelda, then talked at length with
first lady Nancy Reagan, the officials said, sobbing
at times and complaining bitterly about the
couple's plight in exile.
The phone call, which a Marcos spokesman said
lasted more than an hour, took place Saturday af
ternoon, after the Reagans had settled into a plush
beachfront house, owned by a Honolulu developer,
where they are staying during a rest stop in Hawaii.
Marcos spoke yesterday to about 12,000 sup
porters at a Manila rally through a telephone
hookup, telling them, "I am your legitimate presi
dent. " He also urged them to continue peaceful
protests agaiast the Aquino government.
"I am ready to fight," Marcos said over giant
loudspeakers mounted on the stage of the rally.
"But 1 am not there. It's up to you to fight for what
we've been fighting for, which is nothing but
freedom and justice."
Although Marcos' voice sounded strong and his
tone firm — at one point he addressed the
Philippine armed forces as "my soldiers" and urged

them "not to be deceived" — former first lady Im
elda Marcos wept aloud and her voice cracked con
stantly during a brief statement broadcast to the
crowd.
"The president is here in Hawaii like me, but our
hearts and our minds are with you," she said, sob
bing. "We were stripped of our citizenship . . . but
still, I love you all."
U.S. officials privately expressed anger at the call
to the rally. They also said the White House had
been surprised and distressed to discover that
Marcos allowed a local television crew to record

the opening pleasantries of his conversation with
Reagan, and a later portion that showed Imeida
crying as she spoke on the phone.
"The reaction here was, 'What a clod,' " an Ad
ministration official said.
Reagan's plan to call Marcos, announced Tues
day, had irritated the Aquino government. To as
suage the concerns, Reagan made his first call to
Corazon Aquino Thursday for a three-minute con
versation in which Reagan invited her to visit the
United States.
Air Force One leaves Hawaii today to fly to
Guam for refueling and then to Bali, Indonesia, for
a meeting with the foreign ministers of six South
east Asian nations.
Reagan called Marcos "because he's an old
friend and ally who exhibited statesmanship in the
early stages in the orderly transfer of power in the
Philippines," White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said. Although the two men were staying
only 2-1/2 miles apart, the White House had ruled
out a face-to-face meeting.
Speakes refused to divulge details of the con
versation and would not confirm its length.
At a press briefing yesterday, Speakes took pains
to reiterate the official U.S. position on the
Philippines. "We support President Aquino's gov
ernment and encourage its policies of economic,
political and military reform," he said. "In the final
analysis, it is up to the Filipino people themselves
to determine their future and they have voiced
their will in this regard."
