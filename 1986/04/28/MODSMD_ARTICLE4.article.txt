# Montgomery chosen as basketball coach
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
After a nearly month-long search that he
began in Dallas at the NCAA basketball cham
pionship — a search which included more than
40 candidates and almost three weeks on the
telephone — Athletic Director Andy Geiger
made this statement Friday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion:
"1 am delighted to announce that Mike
Montgomery is the new basketball coach at
Stanford University."
Montgomery will succeed Tom Davis, who
left April 6 to become the coach at the Univer

sity of lowa. Like Davis, who came to Stanford
four years ago from a winning program at Bos
ton College, Montgomery will bring a history of
success to the Farm.
For the last eight years, Montgomery has
been the top man at the University of Montana,
where he compiled a 154-77 record. He has had
nothing but winning seasons, as had Davis
before he came to Stanford. This year, he
guided the Grizzlies to a 21-11 overall mark, a
share of the regular season title of the Big Sky
Conference and a National Invitation Tourna
ment appearance.
"He's a quality person," Geiger said.
"Players really improve under his leadership."

In seeking candidates and soliciting opinions
about them, Geiger talked with coaches all over
the country and even turned to his peers for ad
vice.
"There isn't an athletic director in the busi
ness that doesn't know coaches," he said. "You
know who's respected."
Sifting through the qualifications of the unex
pectedly large pool of candidates was difficult,
but Geiger was happy to make the extra effort.
"The circumstances in which this job opened up
were interesting, to say the least," he said. "But
I was delighted with the interest shown in this
job."

And Montgomery was equally delighted to
get it.
"It's been a dream of mine for a long, long
time," said Montgomery, who contacted Geicer
about the position four years ago before Davis
was hired. "My interest in Stanford goes back
many years because of the status of the Univer
sity and all it entails."
Geiger said that there were "four or five"
final candidates, but declined to name them.
One of the strongest was rumored to be former
Detroit Pistons' assistant Dick Harter. "I was
worried about Harter," Montgomery said.
