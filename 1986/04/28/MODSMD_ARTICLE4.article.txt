# Montgomery chosen as basketball coach
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
After a nearly month-long search that he
began in Dallas at the NCAA basketball cham
pionship — a search which included more than
40 candidates and almost three weeks on the
telephone — Athletic Director Andy Geiger
made this statement Friday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion:
"1 am delighted to announce that Mike
Montgomery is the new basketball coach at
Stanford University."
Montgomery will succeed Tom Davis, who
left April 6 to become the coach at the Univer

sity of lowa. Like Davis, who came to Stanford
four years ago from a winning program at Bos
ton College, Montgomery will bring a history of
success to the Farm.
For the last eight years, Montgomery has
been the top man at the University of Montana,
where he compiled a 154-77 record. He has had
nothing but winning seasons, as had Davis
before he came to Stanford. This year, he
guided the Grizzlies to a 21-11 overall mark, a
share of the regular season title of the Big Sky
Conference and a National Invitation Tourna
ment appearance.
"He's a quality person," Geiger said.
"Players really improve under his leadership."

In seeking candidates and soliciting opinions
about them, Geiger talked with coaches all over
the country and even turned to his peers for ad
vice.
"There isn't an athletic director in the busi
ness that doesn't know coaches," he said. "You
know who's respected."
Sifting through the qualifications of the unex
pectedly large pool of candidates was difficult,
but Geiger was happy to make the extra effort.
"The circumstances in which this job opened up
were interesting, to say the least," he said. "But
I was delighted with the interest shown in this
job."

And Montgomery was equally delighted to
get it.
"It's been a dream of mine for a long, long
time," said Montgomery, who contacted Geicer
about the position four years ago before Davis
was hired. "My interest in Stanford goes back
many years because of the status of the Univer
sity and all it entails."
Geiger said that there were "four or five"
final candidates, but declined to name them.
One of the strongest was rumored to be former
Detroit Pistons' assistant Dick Harter. "I was
worried about Harter," Montgomery said.
Because Davis' departure was linked to the diffi
culty of getting talented players admitted to school,
Montgomery was asked many times at the press
conference whether Stanford's rigorous academic
standards would hamper recruiting.
"I'd like to think that kids can read, write and
play basketball too," Montgomery said. "The iden
tification and location process is most important.
It's not an insurmountable problem.
"This is a tremendous university in all aspects,"
he said. "It's not interested in compromising for
athletics or any other matter. And I think that's
fair."
Montgomery met with Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter on Friday and said she was "very suppor
tive" of the basketball program. "She will try to
give me and everyone else an opportunity to win,"
he said. "(Admissions) is a complicated process,
but I left with the feeling that, 'Hey, this can be
done.' "
With Montgomery, if it is done at all, it will prob
ably be done with defense. His teams have usually
been among the nation's top 20 defensively and in
1978-79, his first season, the Grizzlies were fourth.
"Much of what we do is dictated by our person
nel," Montgomery said. "(But) we will play
defense. We will be aggressive.
"I believe in high percentage basketball. I
believe in physical basketball," Montgomery said.
"I prefer big, strong kids."
At Stanford, however, finding big, strong kids

who are academically qualified is easier said than
done. The "identification and location process"
mentioned above will be a major task of
Montgomery's assistant coaches. "The staff is very
important here," he said. "They must be willing to
work hard to find the Stanford-type kid."

This season, an upset loss to Montana State in
the Big Sky tournament denied Montana a berth in
the NCAA tournament. In the National Invita
tiqnal Tournament, the Grizzlies lost to Texas
Christian University in the first round. It was their
only home loss of the year after 16 victories.

Montgomery also led Montana to the NIT in
1985, but the Grizzlies were eliminated in the first
round by eventual champion UCLA. Stanford has
not been to a postseason tournament since 1942,
when it won the NCAA Championship.
If history repeats itself. Stanford should fare well
with Montgomery, because the last two former
Montana coaches have been very successful once
they moved on. Montgomery's predecessor was
current Wyoming Coach Jim Brandenburg, whose
team reached the NIT finals this year. Before Bran
denburg, the Grizzlies were led by Jud Heathcote,
who took Michigan State to the final 16ofthe 1986
NCAA tournament.
Montgomery has not chosen his assistants yet,
nor did he choose a timetable for doing so. One
strong candidate, however, is Bob Niehl. one of
Montgomery's assistants at Montana.
Montgomery's first task will be to talk to the
recruits that Stanford is still in the running for. Al
though they may be frustrated with the delay
caused by the coaching change, Geiger is optimistic
that they will sign with the Cardinal after speaking
with Montgomery.
"They still haven't signed, which 1 think is an in
dication that they were waiting to meet the Stan
ford coach," Geiger said.
Montgomery is a 1968 graduate of Long Beach
State, where he played for current University of
Nevada-Las Vegas Coach Jerry Tarkanian. After
describing his all-out, scrappy, overachieving style
of play, someone suggested that he would have fit
right in at Stanford.
But Montgomery disagreed. "1 would not have
been admissible," he said.

he said. "(Admissions) is a complicated process,
but I left with the feeling that, 'Hey, this can be
done.' "
With Montgomery, if it is done at all, it will prob
ably be done with defense. His teams have usually
been among the nation's top 20 defensively and in
1978-79, his first season, the Grizzlies were fourth.
"Much of what we do is dictated by our person
nel," Montgomery said. "(But) we will play
defense. We will be aggressive.
"I believe in high percentage basketball. I
believe in physical basketball," Montgomery said.
"I prefer big, strong kids."
At Stanford, however, finding big, strong kids

who are academically qualified is easier said than
done. The "identification and location process"
mentioned above will be a major task of
Montgomery's assistant coaches. "The staff is very
important here," he said. "They must be willing to
work hard to find the Stanford-type kid."

This season, an upset loss to Montana State in
the Big Sky tournament denied Montana a berth in
the NCAA tournament. In the National Invita
tiqnal Tournament, the Grizzlies lost to Texas
Christian University in the first round. It was their
only home loss of the year after 16 victories.

Montgomery also led Montana to the NIT in
1985, but the Grizzlies were eliminated in the first
round by eventual champion UCLA. Stanford has
not been to a postseason tournament since 1942,
when it won the NCAA Championship.
If history repeats itself. Stanford should fare well
with Montgomery, because the last two former
Montana coaches have been very successful once
they moved on. Montgomery's predecessor was
current Wyoming Coach Jim Brandenburg, whose
team reached the NIT finals this year. Before Bran
denburg, the Grizzlies were led by Jud Heathcote,
who took Michigan State to the final 16ofthe 1986
NCAA tournament.
Montgomery has not chosen his assistants yet,
nor did he choose a timetable for doing so. One
strong candidate, however, is Bob Niehl. one of
Montgomery's assistants at Montana.
Montgomery's first task will be to talk to the
recruits that Stanford is still in the running for. Al
though they may be frustrated with the delay
caused by the coaching change, Geiger is optimistic
that they will sign with the Cardinal after speaking
with Montgomery.
"They still haven't signed, which 1 think is an in
dication that they were waiting to meet the Stan
ford coach," Geiger said.
Montgomery is a 1968 graduate of Long Beach
State, where he played for current University of
Nevada-Las Vegas Coach Jerry Tarkanian. After
describing his all-out, scrappy, overachieving style
of play, someone suggested that he would have fit
right in at Stanford.
But Montgomery disagreed. "1 would not have
been admissible," he said.


Mike Montgomery
New basketball coach
After a nearly month-long search that he
began in Dallas at the NCAA basketball cham
pionship — a search which included more than
40 candidates and almost three weeks on the
telephone — Athletic Director Andy Geiger
made this statement Friday afternoon at Maples
Pavilion:
"1 am delighted to announce that Mike
Montgomery is the new basketball coach at
Stanford University."
Montgomery will succeed Tom Davis, who
left April 6 to become the coach at the Univer

sity of lowa. Like Davis, who came to Stanford
four years ago from a winning program at Bos
ton College, Montgomery will bring a history of
success to the Farm.
For the last eight years, Montgomery has
been the top man at the University of Montana,
where he compiled a 154-77 record. He has had
nothing but winning seasons, as had Davis
before he came to Stanford. This year, he
guided the Grizzlies to a 21-11 overall mark, a
share of the regular season title of the Big Sky
Conference and a National Invitation Tourna
ment appearance.
"He's a quality person," Geiger said.
"Players really improve under his leadership."

In seeking candidates and soliciting opinions
about them, Geiger talked with coaches all over
the country and even turned to his peers for ad
vice.
"There isn't an athletic director in the busi
ness that doesn't know coaches," he said. "You
know who's respected."
Sifting through the qualifications of the unex
pectedly large pool of candidates was difficult,
but Geiger was happy to make the extra effort.
"The circumstances in which this job opened up
were interesting, to say the least," he said. "But
I was delighted with the interest shown in this
job."

And Montgomery was equally delighted to
get it.
"It's been a dream of mine for a long, long
time," said Montgomery, who contacted Geicer
about the position four years ago before Davis
was hired. "My interest in Stanford goes back
many years because of the status of the Univer
sity and all it entails."
Geiger said that there were "four or five"
final candidates, but declined to name them.
One of the strongest was rumored to be former
Detroit Pistons' assistant Dick Harter. "I was
worried about Harter," Montgomery said.
Because Davis' departure was linked to the diffi
culty of getting talented players admitted to school,
Montgomery was asked many times at the press
conference whether Stanford's rigorous academic
standards would hamper recruiting.
"I'd like to think that kids can read, write and
play basketball too," Montgomery said. "The iden
tification and location process is most important.
It's not an insurmountable problem.
"This is a tremendous university in all aspects,"
he said. "It's not interested in compromising for
athletics or any other matter. And I think that's
fair."
Montgomery met with Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter on Friday and said she was "very suppor
tive" of the basketball program. "She will try to
give me and everyone else an opportunity to win,"
he said. "(Admissions) is a complicated process,
but I left with the feeling that, 'Hey, this can be
done.' "
