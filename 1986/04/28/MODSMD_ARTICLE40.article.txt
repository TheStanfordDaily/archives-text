Three ad giants merge
Three of the nation's largest advertising
agencies — BBDO International, Doyle Dane
Bernbach Group and Needham Harper World
wide — said yesterday that they are combining to
form the largest advertising agency holding com
pany in the world.
The three New York agencies, each of which
has offices in Los Angeles, will operate under a
new holding company that will have combined
media billings of about $5 billion a year. The
companies said their merger is the first three-way
combination in the U.S. advertising industry.
BBDO International,formerly Batten, Barton,
Durstine & Osborne, had 1985 billings of $2.5
billion. Its clients include Dodge, Wrigley, Pep
sico, Frito-Lay and Genera! Electric.
Doyle Dane Bernbach, which billings of $1.7
billion last year, lists American Greetings, Bor
den consumer products, Celanese Fibers and
Nabisco among its clients. Privately held Need
ham Harper, with $847.3 million in billings, has
American Honda, Campbell Soup, Clorox,
Frigidaire and General Mills as clients.
Allen Rosenshine, chief executive of BBDO
International, said in a telephone interview that
the merger was not contemplated "simply with
the view of getting bigger." He explained: "We
want to be nothing less than advertising's global
creative superpower."

Salt 2 struggles foreseen
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's
tentative decision to stay within the limits of the
unratified SALT 2 treaty included directives that
set the stage for more bureaucratic battling late
this year on the future of U.S. land-based inter
continental missiles as well as continued U.S. ad
herence to the pact, according to administration
officials.
While deciding to "go the extra mile" for arms
control by dismantling two Poseidon missile sub
marines as required by the second SALT Treaty,
Reagan authorized a "strategic-modernization"
study to be the focus of new decision-making at
the White House in December on future devel
opment of land-based missiles.
Also around December, Reagan will face an
other SALT 2 limitation issue when the number
of bombers carrying air-launched cruise missiles
will bump up against the treaty's limits. To stay
within the treaty, Reagan would have to suspend
the cruise missile modernization program for the
B-52H aircraft or dismantle some strategic
weapon such as another Poseidon submarine or
land-based Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballis
tic missiles (ICBMs) to compensate for the addi
tional cruise missiles.
Pentagon and Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency officials, who favored breaching the
SALT 2 limits in the recent round of policy

making in response to alleged Soviet arms
control violations, said the just-completed White
House discussions make it likely that Reagan will
exceed SALT 2 limits at the end of the year.
U.S.-Soviet talks held
WASHINGTON — Despite the cooling of
U.S.-Soviet relations following the U.S. bombing
of Libya, the two nuclear superpowers held
technical-level talks here last week on upgrading
the hot line and are expected to hold several sets
of more substantive diplomatic discussions in the
weeks ahead, according to administration offi
cials.
Shultz, appearing last Tuesday in a Voice of
America interview, said, "We think there are
many important problems that need to be dis
cussed, that need to be negotiated about and po
tential agreements that could be made."
A Pentagon spokesman said the meetings of
technical experts on upgrading the Washington-
Moscow crisis communications link or hot line
were held here Wednesday through Friday.
The spokesman said the U.S. team under Dep
uty Asst. Secretary of State for communications
Robert Ribera worked with the Soviet team on
"fine tuning" the operations of facsimile trans
mission through the line.
