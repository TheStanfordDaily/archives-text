Spy scheduled to testify
SAN FRANCISCO — John Walker takes the
witness stand in federal court today to publicly
describe for the first time his 17 years as a Soviet
spy master, and to accuse ex-Navy buddy Jerry
Whitworth of espionage.
The government, admitting Walker is a traitor,
will ask jurors to believe his testimony and con
vict Whitworth as a spy. The defense will argue
that Walker's accusations are self-serving lies.
For Whitworth. a retired Navy radioman who
faces the prospect of life in prison if convicted,
this is the first confrontation with Walker since
both men were arrested nearly a year ago.
Whitworth. 46. who had a spotless service
record, is accused of being the chief supplier of
classified codes and communications data that
Walker sold to the Soviets. The government al
leges that he received $332,000 and has charged
him with 13 counts of espionage and tax evasion,
seven of which carry potential life sentences.
Whitworth says he is innocent and his lawyers
say he is being offered as a sacrificial lamb by

Walker, who won leniency for himself and his 23-
year-old son. Michael, by agreeing to be the star
witness against Whitworth.
The prosecution, while conceding Walker has a
credibility problem, is relying on him to provide
key evidence against Whitworth in the trial that
began March 24.
Gas prices may increase
LOS ANGELES — The steady decline of
retail gasoline prices since December is bottom
ing out and a moderate rise is likely over the
summer, industry analyst Dan Lundberg said
yesterday.
The retail price decline continued last week,
but Lundberg's biweekly survey of 15.000 ser
vice stations showed the overall price of gasoline
was 89.96 cents a gallon, a drop of 0.1 I cent
since April 11.
Wholesale prices to dealers increased by 1.38
cents a gallon during the same period.
Average pump price for each grade was 76.82

cents a gallon for leaded regular, 82.72 cents for
unleaded regular and 97.87 cents for premium
unleaded. Prices include all taxes and are from
self-serve pumps.
The retail price plunge began in December
when the overall price was $1.2145 a gallon.
Since then, the price has dropped 31.5 cents.
"The fall of prices, I think, has bottomed out
and we're now entering a swoon which will very
shortly begin to rise," Lundberg said.
Lundberg said import fees and an increase in
federal excise taxes are likely to offset continued
low prices, adding that increased summer driving
will not cause prices to rapidly increase.
