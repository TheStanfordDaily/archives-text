## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
Charges of felony battery have been filed
against two freshmen in connection with an
April 11 altercation that left a third student
seriously injured.
Freshmen Randy Von Feldt and Bill
McKelvy were formally charged on Friday,
Deputy District Attorney Ronald Rico told the
San Jose Mercury News.
If found guilty, each student could be sen
tenced to up to four years in a state prison, Rico
told the Mercury News.
Freshman David Curry suffered broken ribs
and a collapsed lung during a fight with Von
Feldt and McKelvy after the three had attended

Rush parties at the Sigma Chi and Delta Up
silon fraternities. The altercation occurred
shortly before 3 a.m. near the Delta Upsilon
fraternity.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer told
The Daily after the incident that Curry had ap
parently been kicked by the two other fresh
men.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said the
three were "quite drunk" at the time of the inci
dent.
"Clearly, alcohol abuse caused this situa
tion," Niemeyer told The Daily.
Curry was rushed to Stanford Hospital later
in the morning after he complained of having
difficulty breathing. He spent 10 days in the
hospital and three days recovering with his

mother in a nearby home. Curry is now back at
Stanford and attending classes.
Curry said last night that although he is still
weak, he "is recovering really fast" and is
"feeling a lot better."
McKelvy told The Daily last night that Curry
started the fight, adding that he has retained an
attorney.
"1 am confident when the true story is told.
Randy and 1 won't be held accountable for a
felony charge," he said, adding that he hoped
the charges would be reduced.
"Basically, it's in the DA's hands," he said.
McKelvy said that although he and Von Feldt
were involved in a "fight" with Curry, they did
not beat him.
After the incident, Niemeyer said that it "was

a gross misunderstanding that resulted in a bru
tal beating."
Curry did not know if a court date had been
set. and declined to comment further on the in
cident.
Von Feldt could not be reached for comment
last night.
According to Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole, the University has "talked to eyewitnesses
. . . and interviewed all those involved "
"We are considering the possibility of funda
mental standards charges against those involved
in the incident," she said.
Cole said she did not know how long the judi
cial process would take on this particular case,
and declined to comment further on any
punitive measures the University would take.
