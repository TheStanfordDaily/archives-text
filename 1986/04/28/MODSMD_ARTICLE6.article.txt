"The Bridge is not a place to go only when you are
having a full-blown crisis. It's a place to talk about any
thing that is bothering you," said Jacqueline Marchan,

one of four seniors who live and counsel at The Bridge,
Stanford's peer-counseling center.
"The idea behind peer-counseling is that we can
provide objective, anonymous service. We're not here
to take the place of friends or family, but to provide
another alternative." added Ron Duran. also a senior
and Bridge live-in.

"We can't solve problems for you, but we can help
you to solve them yourself," said Duran.
With this self-help philosophy in mind, The Bridge,
housed at 640 Campus Drive, provides free peer
counseling and referral information on topics such as
loneliness, depression, relationships, sex and drugs, for
anyone who wishes to call or drop by.
Each quarter The Bridge also organizes workshops,
where interested members of the community can learn
about massage, relaxation techniques, stress manage
ment, or even how to master math and chemistry anx
iety. In addition. The Bridge offers the use of its build
ing and telephones to various community support
groups like Al-Anon, Overeaters Anonymous and the
Gay and Lesbian Counseling group, accord
ing to Duran and Marchan.
"About half the calls we receive are not
from students, but from other members of
the Palo Alto community," said Marchan.
"Their problems are different — a lot of
eating disorders, frustration with work and
family concerns," she added.
"Stanford students call about relationship
problems — boyfriends and girlfriends, or
roommates — and they also call with guilt
problems, over-neglected classwork, for ex
ample," said Duran.
Marchan has worked at The Bridge for
two years, and noted that, "This year in par
ticular, we've had a lot more calls from
freshmen with friendship and social prob
lems, saying that Stanford wasn't what they
had expected."
"We refer many of our calls, " said
Duran, "In fact, we only have about 150
calls per quarter which we actually counsel."
Psychology Prof. Dr. Vince D'Andrea is
one of the original founders of The Bridge.
D'Andrea teaches the two-unit class which
must be taken before staffing at The Bridge;
Psych 167: Peer Counseling Techniques.
He explained, "Psych 167 teaches crisis
counseling in general. For serious problems
like suicide, severe depression, eating disor
ders or drug abuse, students are taught to
recognize them and not to try to work with
them."
Instead, Bridge counselors are equipped

with a wealth of referral information and aid
severe cases in finding professional help, ac
cording to Marchan and Duran.
The Bridge was originally founded in the
late'6os as a drug crisis center to combat the
increasing problem of heroin abuse in the
Palo Alto community, according to
D'Andrea. "At this time there was support
for a student group who helped other stu-

dents with drug-related problems, and also
with general problems of student life. The
students organized themselves and applied
to the University for space," he said. (The
University still pays for the building, and all
other necessary funds are raised by The
Bridge community at the annual Spring Fair,
held this year in White Plaza on May 9, 10
and 11).
According to D'Andrea, The Bridge has
gone through an evolution from early on,
when it was identified with drug abuse.
"As times changed, students changed, and
The Bridge changed," said Duran.
Brian Cheu, also a Bridge live-in, added,
"Drug use has dropped, but the problems

that caused it are still here."
D'Andrea said, "The Bridge now has
workshops in 'stress management' — well, it
used to be called Yoga. It's the same thing,
but we've given it a new term."
The 30-45 person staff at The Bridge is
made up of student volunteers who have
completed Psych 167 and passed the final
exam. "The exam consists of an extended
role-play. An experienced counselor
presents the student with a problem. Then
the student's ability to use the techniques
learned in the class is evaluated by myself
and two staffers," D'Andrea said.
Qualified students may then become part
time staffers, usually working two hours a
week. Those interested in becoming full
time live-in counselors must all meet, and
unanimously decide who should have the
job, according to Marchan.
Students who live at The Bridge answer
telephones 24 hours-a-day, and have to put
up with "people coming in and out all the
time," Duran said.
"You don't have much privacy except in
your room," said Marchan.
The job can be very time-consuming as
well. " Dead week and finals are the heaviest
times — and that's also when the part-time
staffers don't come in," said Marchan.
"When you decide to be a live-in, you have
to realize that it has to be your top priority,"
added Cheu.
Nevertheless, the four live-ins enjoy the
job and find it extremely rewarding. "We
love it," they said, in unison.
