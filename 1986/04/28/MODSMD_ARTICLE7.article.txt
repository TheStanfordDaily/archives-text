# Reagan helps plan his library
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn Campbell met
privately with President Reagan and other officials Friday
in Los Angeles to discuss fund raising for the Reagan Li
brary at Stanford.
Campbell, chairman of the board of trustees of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, told The New
York Times last week that within three months he hopes
to have raised more than 50 percent of the estimated $80
to $100 million needed to build the library.
The library will contain all the Presidential papers ac
cumulated over Reagan's two terms in office.
"I doubt we got $2 million in cash last year," Campbell
told The Times. "The contributions-have not been as large
as I would like. We're looking for two or three "leadership
Kifts.' "

The foundation is hoping to present a library to Reagan
before he leaves office, the foundation's director Gary
Jones told The Times.
But according to Bob Freelen. University vice president
of public affairs, "trying to meet that date is likely to be a
real struggle."
The foundation is responsible for raising the funds for
the library, and Stanford "provides the site." Freelen said.
The library is slated for an area in the foothills south of
the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
Reagan met privately for about 45 minutes with
Campbell and other foundation executive committee
members at a hotel before he began a 13-day trip to the
Far Fast. White House spokesman Larry Speakes pro
vided few details about the meeting, which was not listed
on the daily schedule released to reporters, according to
The Times.
Campbell declined to comment on the matter yester
day.
