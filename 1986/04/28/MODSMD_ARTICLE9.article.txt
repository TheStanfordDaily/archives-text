# Affirmative action cuts spark fear

This is the last article in a series dealing with af
firmative action at Stanford.
Rumblings of public discontent with affirmative
action programs continue to reverberate through
out educational and political circles. Many
minority, women's and disabled rights groups are
concerned with a possible change in federal policy
that could roll back federally-mandated affirmative
action goals and timetables.
Even some top government officials oppose the
proposed changes, and colleges and universities are
continuing voluntary and mandated affirmative ac
tion plans while stepping up their criticism of any
loosening of federal guidelines.
"The external political climate regarding affirm
ative action is not a particularly encouraging one,"
said University President Donald Kennedy in a
statement in November reaffirming Stanford's
commitment to affirmative action.
In a climate of increased competition for jobs,
any attempt to address problems of dispropor
tionately small numbers of minorities or women in
a workforce often breeds a backlash of allegations
of "reverse discrimination," many affirmative ac
tion proponents have said recently.
The "negative tone" emanating from the Reagan
Administration fuels a public perception that af
firmative action is a political program rather than a
problematic response to systemic discrimination,
according to Santiago Rodriguez, University af
firmative action officer.
"While I'm not a believer in the (philosophy)
that government can cure everything in society, I
do think there is an absolute requirement that the
government must set the tone for the nation, and
that tone must be a positive one," Rodriguez said.
Government officials also gain "political
mileage" when advocating a change of policy be
cause many members of white, working-class soci
ety resist any program which appears to favor only
blacks or other minorities, according to visiting
Law Prof. Derrick Bell.
Bell, an expert on Constitutional and civil rights
law, said this reluctance often overwhelms any
realization that affirmative action could benefit
both white and minority groups suffering from dis
crimination.
"There is a very interesting and long-standing
phenomena in this country in which the great mass
of working-class white seems either insensitive to
or unwilling to challenge the 'class' unfairness in
our society because the basis of their sense of self
depends less on getting a fair shake themselves

than maintaining a sense that they're better ott
than blacks," Bell said.
Other university administrators, such as Derek
Bok, president of Harvard University, have said af
firmative action is necessary in light of the poor
results of simple "non-discrimination, non
preference" university policies before 1965.
Instead of touting the positive values brought by
a diverse environment, Rodriguez said many gov
ernment officials now actively oppose the policy
they are charged with implementing.
Supporters of affirmative action are particularly
concerned with statements by Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 and William Bradford Reynolds,
assistant attorney general for civil rights, calling for
relaxation of the goal and timetable requirements
in mandated affirmative action.
"Lately, they seem to show more concern for the
alleged victims of reverse discrimination than for
the traditional victims of discrimination,"
Rodriguez said.
Others accuse the federal government with being
more than just tentative in its support of affirma
tive action. Only a very strong disability rights
movement has thwarted continued Justice Depart
ment attempts to "undermine" existing legislation
mandating accessibility, said Jim Bouquin, director
of Disabled Student Services.
But there is vocal support for affirmative action
in some quarters of the government. Last Novem
ber, Labor Department senior officials opposed to
relaxing the goal and timetable affirmative action
requirements leaked to The New York Times an
internal memorandum refuting charges that goals
are quotas in disguise.
Rather, goals are "fixed floors or ceilings which
drive the employer — they inform the employer
that a difference exists between its employment
profile and the qualified persons available to him
and ask that he use his good faith effort to insure
that the gap is closed."
Meese later clarified his stance, saying that his
goal in weakening affirmative action rules was to
protect businesses from officials who have
"perverted" the rules.
Another thorn in the side of affirmative action
proponents has been Clarence Pendleton, a black
conservative whom Reagan appointed chairman of
the U S. Civil Rights Commission.
Because of his attacks on affirmative action and
liberal "racism," Pendleton has sparked contro
versy and recently gained headlines when fellow
commission member John Bunzel, a Hoover Insti
tution senior research fellow, wrote a public letter
urging him to resign.
In addition to commission members' dissatisfac

tion with Pendleton's outspokenness on sensitive is
sues and usurping authority to speak for the entire
commission, several government agencies are also
now investigating allegations of financial im
propriety within the commission staff and
Pendleton's own personal finances.
In several published opinion pieces, Bunzel indi
cated his support of the principle of non
discrimination found in Executive Order 11246,
the cornerstone of affirmative action policy, but
said most affirmative action programs do not follow
the values expressed in former President Lyndon
Johnson's 1965 executive order."
"Through a variety of regulations and court
rulings, the original purpose of affirmative action
has been transformed from a policy of non
discrimination which required the treatment of all
persons without regard to their race, sex or back
ground into a policy of affirmative discrimination
which identifies persons solely on the basis of their
race, sex or national origin."
Although most people agree with affirmative ac
tion plans that have been implemented as a result
of court findings of discrimination, Bell, a Harvard
professor as well as a former dean of the University
of Oregon Law School, said affirmative action crit
ics fail to recognize the broadening of opportun
ities for minorities. Those opportunities fos
tered by affirmative action also serve to broaden
the opportunities of most whites, yielding "much
different and much fairer" hiring practices than
those which previously existed.
"I think that is appropriate (and) in keeping with
the pattern in our society in which rights fought for
on behalf of black society sooner rather than
later get expanded to encompass the whole popula
tion," according to Bell.
An example, Bell said, was the use of the 14th
Amendment to give rights to previously dis
criminated white ethnic groups in addition to its
originally intended function to guarantee of black
civil rights.
Bunzel, a former president of San Jose State
University and mayor of San Jose, said his experi
ence in academia "confirmed what administrators
and university teachers across the country have dis
covered — that fixed ratios, percentages, or
"numerical goals and timetables" in academic ap
pointments, when put into actual practice, are al
most invariably thinly disguised equivalents of
quotas."
In a published review of the Civil Rights Com
mission Report of Affirmative Action in ihe 1980s,
Bunzel said affirmative action plans may partially
rest on statistical differences between
minority availablility and actual
percentage in a workforce which "do
not automatically point to dis
criminatory behavior."
"The general deficiency of the ar
gument that 'under-representation'
or 'disproportionality' is tantamount
to discrimination is that it overlooks
the fact that there have always been
differences of values, attitudes,
tastes, expectations and aspirations
among the various groups which com
pose this or any other country," Bun
zel wrote.
In an opinion published in the Feb.
4, 1985 issue of New Republic, Bok
said resentment from those who feel

unjustly excluded is a real concern,
but one outweighed by overall socie
tal benefits.
"In the end, the vital question is
not whether preferential admission is
a success after 15 years, but whether
it has made more progress toward
overcoming the leagacy of discrimi
nation than other strategies that uni
versities might have pursued," Bok
said.
The prospect of forgoing affirma
tive action would be a big step in the
wrong direction, supporters say.
"1 am kind of afraid that our cul
ture has allowed a little bit of prog
ress in terms of accessibility for other
groups and then backed off," Bou
quin said. "There's a big step that we
need to make, from fixing things up
that are made wrong in the first place
(to) making our environment accessi
ble to begin with."

action goals and timetables.
Even some top government officials oppose the
proposed changes, and colleges and universities are
continuing voluntary and mandated affirmative ac
tion plans while stepping up their criticism of any
loosening of federal guidelines.
"The external political climate regarding affirm
ative action is not a particularly encouraging one,"
said University President Donald Kennedy in a
statement in November reaffirming Stanford's
commitment to affirmative action.
In a climate of increased competition for jobs,
any attempt to address problems of dispropor
tionately small numbers of minorities or women in
a workforce often breeds a backlash of allegations
of "reverse discrimination," many affirmative ac
tion proponents have said recently.
The "negative tone" emanating from the Reagan
Administration fuels a public perception that af
firmative action is a political program rather than a
problematic response to systemic discrimination,
according to Santiago Rodriguez, University af
firmative action officer.
"While I'm not a believer in the (philosophy)
that government can cure everything in society, I
do think there is an absolute requirement that the
government must set the tone for the nation, and
that tone must be a positive one," Rodriguez said.
Government officials also gain "political
mileage" when advocating a change of policy be
cause many members of white, working-class soci
ety resist any program which appears to favor only
blacks or other minorities, according to visiting
Law Prof. Derrick Bell.
Bell, an expert on Constitutional and civil rights
law, said this reluctance often overwhelms any
realization that affirmative action could benefit
both white and minority groups suffering from dis
crimination.
"There is a very interesting and long-standing
phenomena in this country in which the great mass
of working-class white seems either insensitive to
or unwilling to challenge the 'class' unfairness in
our society because the basis of their sense of self
depends less on getting a fair shake themselves

than maintaining a sense that they're better ott
than blacks," Bell said.
Other university administrators, such as Derek
Bok, president of Harvard University, have said af
firmative action is necessary in light of the poor
results of simple "non-discrimination, non
preference" university policies before 1965.
Instead of touting the positive values brought by
a diverse environment, Rodriguez said many gov
ernment officials now actively oppose the policy
they are charged with implementing.
Supporters of affirmative action are particularly
concerned with statements by Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 and William Bradford Reynolds,
assistant attorney general for civil rights, calling for
relaxation of the goal and timetable requirements
in mandated affirmative action.
"Lately, they seem to show more concern for the
alleged victims of reverse discrimination than for
the traditional victims of discrimination,"
Rodriguez said.
Others accuse the federal government with being
more than just tentative in its support of affirma
tive action. Only a very strong disability rights
movement has thwarted continued Justice Depart
ment attempts to "undermine" existing legislation
mandating accessibility, said Jim Bouquin, director
of Disabled Student Services.
But there is vocal support for affirmative action
in some quarters of the government. Last Novem
ber, Labor Department senior officials opposed to
relaxing the goal and timetable affirmative action
requirements leaked to The New York Times an
internal memorandum refuting charges that goals
are quotas in disguise.
Rather, goals are "fixed floors or ceilings which
drive the employer — they inform the employer
that a difference exists between its employment
profile and the qualified persons available to him
and ask that he use his good faith effort to insure
that the gap is closed."
Meese later clarified his stance, saying that his
goal in weakening affirmative action rules was to
protect businesses from officials who have
"perverted" the rules.
Another thorn in the side of affirmative action
proponents has been Clarence Pendleton, a black
conservative whom Reagan appointed chairman of
the U S. Civil Rights Commission.
Because of his attacks on affirmative action and
liberal "racism," Pendleton has sparked contro
versy and recently gained headlines when fellow
commission member John Bunzel, a Hoover Insti
tution senior research fellow, wrote a public letter
urging him to resign.
In addition to commission members' dissatisfac

tion with Pendleton's outspokenness on sensitive is
sues and usurping authority to speak for the entire
commission, several government agencies are also
now investigating allegations of financial im
propriety within the commission staff and
Pendleton's own personal finances.
In several published opinion pieces, Bunzel indi
cated his support of the principle of non
discrimination found in Executive Order 11246,
the cornerstone of affirmative action policy, but
said most affirmative action programs do not follow
the values expressed in former President Lyndon
Johnson's 1965 executive order."
"Through a variety of regulations and court
rulings, the original purpose of affirmative action
has been transformed from a policy of non
discrimination which required the treatment of all
persons without regard to their race, sex or back
ground into a policy of affirmative discrimination
which identifies persons solely on the basis of their
race, sex or national origin."
Although most people agree with affirmative ac
tion plans that have been implemented as a result
of court findings of discrimination, Bell, a Harvard
professor as well as a former dean of the University
of Oregon Law School, said affirmative action crit
ics fail to recognize the broadening of opportun
ities for minorities. Those opportunities fos
tered by affirmative action also serve to broaden
the opportunities of most whites, yielding "much
different and much fairer" hiring practices than
those which previously existed.
"I think that is appropriate (and) in keeping with
the pattern in our society in which rights fought for
on behalf of black society sooner rather than
later get expanded to encompass the whole popula
tion," according to Bell.
An example, Bell said, was the use of the 14th
Amendment to give rights to previously dis
criminated white ethnic groups in addition to its
originally intended function to guarantee of black
civil rights.
Bunzel, a former president of San Jose State
University and mayor of San Jose, said his experi
ence in academia "confirmed what administrators
and university teachers across the country have dis
covered — that fixed ratios, percentages, or
"numerical goals and timetables" in academic ap
pointments, when put into actual practice, are al
most invariably thinly disguised equivalents of
quotas."
In a published review of the Civil Rights Com
mission Report of Affirmative Action in ihe 1980s,
Bunzel said affirmative action plans may partially
rest on statistical differences between
minority availablility and actual
percentage in a workforce which "do
not automatically point to dis
criminatory behavior."
"The general deficiency of the ar
gument that 'under-representation'
or 'disproportionality' is tantamount
to discrimination is that it overlooks
the fact that there have always been
differences of values, attitudes,
tastes, expectations and aspirations
among the various groups which com
pose this or any other country," Bun
zel wrote.
In an opinion published in the Feb.
4, 1985 issue of New Republic, Bok
said resentment from those who feel

unjustly excluded is a real concern,
but one outweighed by overall socie
tal benefits.
"In the end, the vital question is
not whether preferential admission is
a success after 15 years, but whether
it has made more progress toward
overcoming the leagacy of discrimi
nation than other strategies that uni
versities might have pursued," Bok
said.
The prospect of forgoing affirma
tive action would be a big step in the
wrong direction, supporters say.
"1 am kind of afraid that our cul
ture has allowed a little bit of prog
ress in terms of accessibility for other
groups and then backed off," Bou
quin said. "There's a big step that we
need to make, from fixing things up
that are made wrong in the first place
(to) making our environment accessi
ble to begin with."
