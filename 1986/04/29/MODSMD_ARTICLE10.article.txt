New assumptions
change perspective
on abortion issue
In their editorial (The Daily, April
23), the editors give the usual argu
ments for liberal abortion laws, neatly
sidestepping the unpleasant possibil
ity that such laws might amount to
legalized slaughter. Although the
writers assert that "the question of
abortion centers on much more than
the question of when a life begins," I
suspect that they have, in fact,
assumed that the fetus is not a human
being, in which case their arguments
gain considerable force.
Let us suppose, though, that a fetus
is a human being, anct then examine
the "pro-choice" arguments. How
persuasive are these arguments when
the word "fetus" is replaced by the
word "infant" and the word
"abortion" by "infanticide"? With as
little paraphrasing of the editorial as
possible, I shall modify the arguments
as indicated above, following each ar
gument with my own observations.
"The quality of life the infant might
expect to enjoy, the circumstances
surrounding the birth, and the beliefs
and wishes of the mother and father
are as important as the life of the in
fant."
Presumably if the child is handi
capped or retarded, or if the parents
find their offspring wanting in some
other respect, then we must respect
their wishes to kill the child. This type
of reasoning might find favor among
some radical eugenicists, but not, I
pray, among ordinary people.
"The right of a woman to choose
infanticide is something that should
never be taken away."
1 think that most people would
agree after considering this statement
that the "right to choose" is not abso
lute.

"In many cases, the continued life
of an unwanted child can be more in
humane than the supposed 'murder'
of it through infanticide."
Granted, killing abused or ne
glected children would be an effective
way of curtailing child abuse, but is
such a drastic solution really warran
ted?
"It is the right of a woman to
dispose of her infant if the child is the
result of a failed form of birth con
trol."
Birth control failure is indeed un
fortunate, but I should not care to
explain to a jury how failed birth con
trol caused me to dismember my child
or immerse him in a saline solution.
The final argument given for
legalized abortion concerns the case
of rape-induced pregnancy. In my
opinion, this is the only argument
worth serious consideration. It is pe
ripheral to the abortion debate,
though, since even countries with
restrictive abortion laws generally al
low for abortion in the case of rape. It
is difficult, in any event, to see how
the existence of sexual abuse and
rape can justify more than a million
abortions annually which do not
result from sexual abuse or rape.
The main arguments for abortion
(except in the case of rape, which ac
counts for a miniscule fraction of all
abortions) appear to collapse if we
suppose the fetus to be a human
being. Evidently, the humanity of the
fetus is not just one of many issues to
be considered; it is in most cases the
central issue.
Given the difficulty of determining
when life begins and the discomfiting
possibility that human life exists
early in pregnancy, it is difficult to
avoid the conclusion that abortion on
demand is gravely irresponsible.

Referendum takes
effect immediately
I would like to correct what ap
pears to be a misimpression on the
part of The Daily as to the result of
the sanctuary referendum on last
week's ASSU ballot. The Daily re
ported on April 22 that "by a margin
of 2,524 to 1,876, students believe
Stanford should be declared a sanctu
ary for Central American refugees."
In fact, students approved a refer
endum which read: "be it resolved
that we declare Stanford a sanctuary
for Central American refugees."
The effect of the referendum was
to declare Stanford a sanctuary, not to
state that students believe Stanford
should be declared a sanctuary. Stan
ford is now a sanctuary.
The sanctuary referendum, unlike
the divestment referendum, is not ad
visory. Action by the Board of Trus
tees is necessary to divest Stanford
stock from companies doing business
in South Africa, however much we
disdain that fact. However, no trustee
action is necessary to declare Stan
ford a sanctuary since such a declara
tion has no legal force, whoever
declares it. Its moral force is derived
from the process which generated it.
In this case, the sanctuary declaration
was derived from a student-wide bal
lot in which all Stanford students
were enfranchised. A statement by
the trustees or by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy would add no
additional moral force, even though
their support would be welcome.
The practical effect of students' ac
tivity in support of sanctuary will in
part be contingent on the degree of
cooperation received by the Univer
sity administration, but administra
tion actions can have no bearing on
the fact that Stanford is a sanctuary.
