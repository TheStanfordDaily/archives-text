## Justice demands West Bank state 
### 
President Reagan's simple, honest convictions
have led him to a sound decision in the bombing of
Libya. If some group is killing your people you stop
them. If this requires war you go to war. Where a
generation of heads of state have been paralyzed by
terrorism, Reagan (finally) has decided simply to
act on principle.
What makes this upstanding response to ter
rorism worrisome is the Reagan Administration's
lack of a comprehensive Middle East policy.
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy supports
terrorism, but the fact is that there are plenty of
dedicated terrorists, mostly Palestinian, for him to
support.

ALEXANDER RAWLS

Much terrorism, including Iranian terrorism and
the indigenous Libyan terrorism, is simply the
result of a fanatical hatred for the West. The
backbone of Middle East terrorism, though, is the
unresolved plight of the Palestinians. If we are
going to get serious about terrorism, it is also time
to get serious with Israel about the creation of an
independent West Bank. Getting tough on ter
rorism can only work if at the same time one is of
fering a fair peace.
It would be a grave error to get involved in a war
against Arab terrorism without, at the same time,
turning our full concern to the problems and griev
ances of the Arab world. Radical leftism and fun
damentalism threaten the stability of virtually
every moderate Arab state. If we are going to stir
military passions, our policies had better be ones
our Arab friends can stand behind, or their and our
position in the Middle East will certainly

deteriorate.
No solution can satisfy the existing hatreds be
tween the Arab fighters and the Jews. What a solu
tion can do is end the continuation of wrongs which
create hatred anew in each generation.
Palestinians on the West Bank currently suffer
under a system of apartheid. Jewish settlers on the
West Bank are Israeli citizens and are served by Is-

raeli law. West Bank Palestinians lack citizenship
and are treated by the Israelis under a separate law.
Because of the high Palestinian birthrate, the
Jews in Israel face a choice between giving up the
West Bank, eventually giving up their Jewish
majority, or making apartheid permanent. Giving
up the majority is out of the question and apartheid
must be too. One day the West Bank must become
an independent state. It should be made indepen

dent now.
The right wing in Israel would like to control the
demography of the Palestinians by suffocating the
last breath out of them. Government settlement
policies show perhaps some fondness for the same
hope. But the United States can have none of it, es
pecially if we would be fighting the terrorism this
treatment inspires.
It would be reasonable for Israel to insist that
any independent West Bank be a demilitarized
state with guarantees for the Jewish settlers there.
With the creation of such a state, time would have a
chance to heal the wounds that continued apartheid
would keep open forever. This is a policy we could
stand behind and, perhaps, is the only hope for the
Middle East to weather its storm of radicalism.
If we wage a war on terrorism that simply helps
the Israelis bludgeon the Palestinians into submis
sion, we will be involving ourselves in an unjust
war. As we should have learned in Vietnam, unjust
wars are very hard to win. They draw unparalleled
bravery and devotion from an enemy who should
have been a friend. They earn us an unparalleled
hatred.
The Palestinian people have already been rent to
the point of nihilism. It is wrong to answer their
violence only with violence. The United States is
strong enough, and must be responsible enough, to
be a healing force in the Middle East.
There is no reason we should not fight alongside
Israel. They deserve whatever help they need from
us. But we cannot fight an unjust war for them.
Reagan's upstanding bravery has led him to con
front terrorism. It is imperative now that he follow
through with a more knowledgeable bravery and
offer a justice that can lead to peace.
