# New budget targets Arts
## 
### 
Recently, The New York Times noted that in President
Reagan's 1987 federal budget more money is allocated to
military bands (just under $100 million) than is allocated
to the only other federal program for the fine arts, the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts. The statement this makes
about the priorities of the Reagan Administration is ob
vious. I wonder what statement this fact makes about the
American people, who let this come about.
1 don't have anything in particular against military
bands. No doubt some John Philip Sousa is very good for
morale when a ship comes in from a long tour of duty. A
Navy band gives a concert in the park in my hometown
every summer. Their pop songs tend to be a little off-key
and a little out-of-date, but the marches are rousing good
fun. The whole event is without question good for public
relations. Indeed, I'm sure public relations are more im
portant to the Administration than high morale: doubtless
some of those concert goers think fondly of those patriotic

songs in November when they go into their polling booths
and have to decide whether or not to vote for more MX
missiles and B-l bombers.
And of course, there are higher priorities in Washing
ton than the National Endowment for the Arts. Senators
who, on their way to work, drive by the homeless sleeping
on heating grates have a hard time justifying more money
for opera. Starving children in Harlem are a bigger and
more important problem than starving painters in SoHo.
And yet, I think there are higher values that the govern
ment must protect as well. Patronage for the arts is a
traditional governmental function. Athens subsidized the
great Greek dramatists. King James I underwrote Shake
speare. Handel, Beethoven, Wagner and Mozart all
received state support. (Mozart not enough.) Da Vinci,
Michelangelo and Rembrandt all depended on govern
ment commissions.
Reagan's attack on cultural spending has counterparts
throughout his proposed federal budget. The National
Endowment for the Humanities has suffered the same fate
as the arts endowment over the past five years; no more
money for uncovering forgotten women poets and black
novelists. Knowledge for knowledge's sake doesn't rate

very high in an administration led by a man who doesn't
even believe in evolution.
Learning in general comes in for a big cut in the next
Reagan budget. Wonder why your tuition is going up so
much faster than the inflation next year? Check out the
Administration's new plan for reimbursing university re
search. For that matter, ask your financial aid officer if
you can qualify for a little larger Guaranteed Student
Loan next year, and see what happens. Those financial aid
people have a tough job; they could use a little humor.
Budget cuts forced the Library of Congress, the nation's
premier book depository, to cut back evening and
weekend hours for the first time ever this spring. Tough
luck if you've got a 9-to-5 job and you want to look some
thing up. The staff at the library recently informed a con
gressman that at current funding levels, low-priority
books acquired this year will not be cataloged and shelved
for another 25 years. Most seriously, the Library of
Congress has been forced to curtail its book preservation
program, which seeks to protect it's thousands of unique
items that were printed on cheap paper, and are gradually
crumbling away into dust.
I don't really mean to suggest that all conservatives are
cultural cretins who burn Balzac for entertainment on Sat
urday nights. San Francisco Symphony Subscribers for
Mondale was not exactly a huge organization. But I do
suggest that history will judge our civilization not by mili
tary might alone, but by our cultural contributions as well.
Militaristic Sparta beat Athens in the Peloponnesian War,
but no one remembers barren, cultureless Sparta, and
everyone remembers Athens.
We as a society can abandon the National Endowment
for the Arts, and our contribution to world culture will be
"Knots' Landing." (Not to mention some damn fine mili
tary music.) Or, for a little bit more, we can try to encour
age a few more Aaron Coplands, Childe Hassams and
William Faulkners. We're talking about a $100 million a
year, about what Reagan wants to spend on attacking
Nicaragua. (If the Sandinistas don't behave, we can drop
Andy Warhol on them.) Out of a trillion-dollar budget, it
seems little enough for the enrichment it brings.
But if federal funding for the arts survives, it will only
be despite the best efforts of the Reagan Administration.
When the Caliph 'Umar sacked Alexandria, Egypt, in 641
A. D., his troops fed the fires of the city's baths for 30 days
and 30 nights with the books of that city's great and ir
replaceable Hellenic library. Perhaps when Reagan opens
the building for his papers here at Stanford, he can call it
the 'Urnar Library.

Recently, The New York Times noted that in President
Reagan's 1987 federal budget more money is allocated to
military bands (just under $100 million) than is allocated
to the only other federal program for the fine arts, the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts. The statement this makes
about the priorities of the Reagan Administration is ob
vious. I wonder what statement this fact makes about the
American people, who let this come about.
1 don't have anything in particular against military
bands. No doubt some John Philip Sousa is very good for
morale when a ship comes in from a long tour of duty. A
Navy band gives a concert in the park in my hometown
every summer. Their pop songs tend to be a little off-key
and a little out-of-date, but the marches are rousing good
fun. The whole event is without question good for public
relations. Indeed, I'm sure public relations are more im
portant to the Administration than high morale: doubtless
some of those concert goers think fondly of those patriotic

songs in November when they go into their polling booths
and have to decide whether or not to vote for more MX
missiles and B-l bombers.
And of course, there are higher priorities in Washing
ton than the National Endowment for the Arts. Senators
who, on their way to work, drive by the homeless sleeping
on heating grates have a hard time justifying more money
for opera. Starving children in Harlem are a bigger and
more important problem than starving painters in SoHo.
And yet, I think there are higher values that the govern
ment must protect as well. Patronage for the arts is a
traditional governmental function. Athens subsidized the
great Greek dramatists. King James I underwrote Shake
speare. Handel, Beethoven, Wagner and Mozart all
received state support. (Mozart not enough.) Da Vinci,
Michelangelo and Rembrandt all depended on govern
ment commissions.
Reagan's attack on cultural spending has counterparts
throughout his proposed federal budget. The National
Endowment for the Humanities has suffered the same fate
as the arts endowment over the past five years; no more
money for uncovering forgotten women poets and black
novelists. Knowledge for knowledge's sake doesn't rate

very high in an administration led by a man who doesn't
even believe in evolution.
Learning in general comes in for a big cut in the next
Reagan budget. Wonder why your tuition is going up so
much faster than the inflation next year? Check out the
Administration's new plan for reimbursing university re
search. For that matter, ask your financial aid officer if
you can qualify for a little larger Guaranteed Student
Loan next year, and see what happens. Those financial aid
people have a tough job; they could use a little humor.
Budget cuts forced the Library of Congress, the nation's
premier book depository, to cut back evening and
weekend hours for the first time ever this spring. Tough
luck if you've got a 9-to-5 job and you want to look some
thing up. The staff at the library recently informed a con
gressman that at current funding levels, low-priority
books acquired this year will not be cataloged and shelved
for another 25 years. Most seriously, the Library of
Congress has been forced to curtail its book preservation
program, which seeks to protect it's thousands of unique
items that were printed on cheap paper, and are gradually
crumbling away into dust.

urday nights. San Francisco Symphony Subscribers for
