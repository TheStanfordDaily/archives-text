## The
						Bug reads flaky witticisms on the wall 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
He stood frozen, enraptured by the vision of
loveliness standing before him. She was cer
tainly the most gorgeous, charming and friendly
woman he had ever encountered. As he stared
into her shimmering eyes successive waves of
infatuation, adoration and unconditional love
swept over his trembling body.
She returned his gaze with equal fervor, her
dazzling lips beckoning him in a most
provocative manner.
Then he thought to himself, "Ah, forget it,
she must have a boyfriend," and with that he
turned and walked away.
Dear Bug Me,
According to Meyer Library graffiti, all
"good" Stanford women are taken. To test this
myth, could you tell us guys how many of this
year's Dollies have boyfriends?
-Name and Address Withheld
This is what you get for believing Meyer Li
brary graffiti. I have to say right off that this
question gets my back up, so I'll have to be per
mitted one of my very rare departures from the
realm of fact into the domain of opinion.
But first, I'll answer the substantive part of
your question. I'm neither nosy nor opportunis
tic enough to address this question to one of the
Dollies, so I consulted a couple reliable sources
within the Band. According to them, three out
of five of the outgoing Dollies and four out of
five of the incoming Dollies currently have
boyfriends. I refuse to name names simply be
cause I don't think this is anybody's business but
the Dollies'.
Furthermore, I just don't think that the rela
tioaship status of the Dollies (though I'm sure
that they are all wonderful young women) is
particularly representative of that of "all 'good'
Stanford women." Which brings me to the big
ger issue contained in this question: namely,
how much truth there is to this whole myth.
Personally, I don't think there's much truth to
it at all. That's not to say that Stanford women
who currently have boyfriends aren't "good,"
but rather, that means that there are still quite a
few fish swimming around waiting for a little
bait to come their way.
The problem with this myth is one of inter
pretation: specifically, just what does "good"
mean in this context. There are all kinds of pos
sible socio-sexual interpretations of the word
"good" when applied to a person of the oppo
site sex (and for some reason, I don't think that
in this context it's meant to refer to the classical
meaning of "good" as morally virtuous.)
For the sake of the argument, though, I would

define "good" Stanford women as those whom
Stanford men would like to go out with. Here
again, though, there's a lot of room for interpre
tation, because every man has a different set of
criteria for a woman he would enjoy dating. The
bottom line is that when one speaks of "all
'good' Stanford women," one is talking about a
lot of people (and when one says that all good
Stanford women are taken, one is insulting a lot
of people â€” namely, all those Stanford women
who don't have boyfriends.)
Since 1 received this question, I have talked to
many Stanford women, all of whom I consider
to be good. None of them agreed with the basic
premise of this myth, and several expressed an
opinion that we Stanford men are just lacking in
social skills.
"I swear, Stanford guys just don't know how
to date," said one.
I'm not so sure that Stanford men are lacking
social skills so much as we're lacking a little time
and courage. Many Stanford students simply
don't have time (or don't want to make time) to
accommodate serious dating. Others just don't
have the guts to ask anyone out, so this whole
myth is a big rationalization used by proud,
cowardly wimps like me to avoid asking anyone
out for fear of being rejected for the first time
since we were picked last for a kickball game in
second grade.
By the same token, it seems that the modern
Stanford woman of the 1980s could take the ini
tiative herself sometimes, and relieve the men
of their heavy social burden. However, I doubt

that many Stanford men are holding their
breath.
Of course, I may be way off base here, and
given the wide range of social and sexual
perspectives represented on this campus, I've
probably ruffled some feathers. Hopefully, I'll
receive some mail if my readers strongly agree
or disagree with this answer.
Generally, though, I think this myth of ail
good Stanford women being already taken is
one of the largest packages of baloney ever
cooked up. As for the Dollies, anyone who
wants to restrict his dating possibilities to a pool
of five of the most sought-after females on
campus is either commendably ambitious or a
glutton for frustration.
This writer is under the impression that there
are tons of wonderful young Stanford women
out there who would love to go out on a date
just as much as Stanford men would love to ask
them. So don't let your spring fever go un
treated. Ask away, and have a good time!
Dear Bug Me,
Do Kellogg's Corn Hakes begin as large
sheets of pulverized corn (and other ingredients)
which are toasted and mysteriously break up into
light, crunchy flakes. Or, are they perhaps cut
into those shapes by a machine? For that matter,
what exactly is the process by which the people in
Battle Creek provide us with that traditional
American breakfast?
-Flakily interested

The people at the Kellogg Company in Battle
Creek, Mich, were kind enough to send me a
brochure all about the production of Corn
Flakes. The process begins with corn that is
milled, specially flavored and then cooked in
giant stainless steel cookers. Then the steaming
corn is dried with purified hot air, after which it
is "tempered and partially carmelized in large
holding tanks" (Sure, I understand this).
Next is the actual flaking process, in which
the cooked grits are pressed into flakes by heavy
mill rollers exerting 40 tons of pressure. Ap
parently, then, the size of the individual flakes is
randomly determined by the amount of grits
that congeal together while going through these
rollers.
After the flaking comes the toasting, during
which the flakes are toasted a "crispy light
brown" while tumbling around in giant rotary
ovens (Don't try this at home, kids).
The final step before packaging is fortifica
tiun, in which the "addition of essential
nutrients guarantees real nutritional value.*'
The packaged flakes are then shipped
nationwide to happy consumers like you and
me.
Some fun flake facts:
From beginning to end, a package of Corn
Flakes is made and packaged in eight hours,
"with the grits traveling about five-and-a-half
miles through a conveyor system."
"A typical packing line can fill, seal and
weigh 76 packages of cereal per minute."
Over 70,000 packages of Corn Flakes are
produced daily at Battle Creek. A grand total of
nearly six million packages of cereal (including
Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops and all the other
Kellogg's products) are manufactured and
packaged in a 24-hour period. That works out
to 2.19 billion packages per year.
Dear Bug Me,
Who nuide the DeGuerre Pool; i.e., what is the
name of the construction company and where is
it based? A friend has been bugging me to find
out for a long time. . . .
- John
This is one of those questions with very limited
popular appeal, which must needs be published
anyway for the sake of public service (and be
cause nobody ever gives me a return address to
send tiny answers like this one to).
Several people helped me with this question
before Gene Kershner, the University's associ
ate director of Project Management, finally
found the actual information for me.
The contractor for DeGuerre Pool was
Howard J. White, Inc., based in Palo Alto.
