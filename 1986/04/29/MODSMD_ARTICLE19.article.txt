## 'Miami Vice' connection can't save this turkey 'Band': just another pesky survival flick 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
< It's time for me to come clean. As
! part of my exquisitely refined trash
; sensibility, I have always adored
. "Miami Vice." Long ago I cheerfully
| abandoned any pretense of having a
• social life, and gave Friday nights
! over to watching Crockett and
; Tubbs as they kept Southern Florida
• safe for Giorgio Armani men's wear
! and Phil Collins songs. My eyes grow
; misty at the thought of the post
. modern architecture, the neon glitz,
; the innumerable crazed Colombian
• dope dealers — in short, all the ele
! ments that make "Miami Vice" the
; masterpiece of 20th-century kitsch
> that it is.
| Allow me to elaborate. Forget
• about Don Johnson's cheekbones.
! Forget about Philip Michael
; Thomas' $800 silk suits. For me, the
• real star of "Miami Vice" has always
; been Michael Mann, the show's ex
' ecutive producer and stylistic guru.
! In developing the show's distinctive
| sound and vision, Mann is almost
• singlehandedly responsible for the
! frantic stampede among today's
; television programs to be hip. Mann
. has now brought a feature film to the
j big screen, "Band of the Hand,"
• which — surprise, surprise — is set
! in Miami and deals with the drug
| trade.
In addition to Mann, one other
| key "Vice" staffer worked on "Band
• of the Hand": none other than Paul
! Michael Glaser, director of such
"Vice" meisterworks as "Smuggler's
Blues" and the two-hour season
premiere last fall. With Mann and
Glaser at the helm, how could
"Band of the Hand" fail to be any
thing but a landmark of modern
cinema?
But alas, the celebrated Crockett
and Tubbs would hang their heads in
shame if they ever saw this movie.
"Band of the Hand" is a veritable
catastrophe of mediocrity. Michael
Mann, how could you do this to me?
Maybe I should've taken the movie's
inane title as a warning as to how
bad it would be. But no, I innocently
strolled into the theatre, expecting at
least to luxuriate in some pretty
colors and sharp compositions. In
stead I was confronted with a film

whose sheer preposterousness is
matched only by its yawn-enforcing
dullness.
The script is a disaster, of course.
The scenario conceived by Leo
Garen and Jack Baran plays like
some bizarre new form of avant
garde comedy. A group of incor
rigible juvenile offenders is taken
out of prison by federal authorities
and unceremoniously dumped in the
middle of the Everglades. There
they meet the rugged Joe Tiger
(Stephen Lang), a Vietnam vet
whose current mission is to teach
these bad boys how to survive out in
the wilds. He trains them until they
are a tough, self-reliant fighting unit.
This rather odd rehabilitation pro
gram gets progressively stranger as
Tiger leads his team of juveniles out
of the Everglades and back to
Miami. They go to a slum and kick
some drug dealers and prostitutes
out of a house. Perhaps inspired by a
certain TV show, they paint their
house in cool pastel colors. They
beat up a pimp. The pimp goes run
ning to his boss, a big-time drug
dealer. This drug dealer has his men
attack our heroes, and Joe Tiger gets
blown away. Our heroes, being a
spunky group of youngsters, respond
by shooting the drug dealer. In a rip
roaring climax, they blow up the
plant where the drug dealer
processes his multi-million dollar
drug supply.
If this sounds like fun, be warned
that "Band of the Hand" is deadly
dull viewing. The script's leaden
pace isn't helped by the fact that not
one of the characters is very likable,
or even very interesting. Joe Tiger is
mildly amusing since he places the
movie firmly in comic book terri
tory, but the juveniles who are
supposed to be our funky heroes are
a singularly charmless bunch. Not
that any of them even look like
juveniles anyway.
The inventiveness that made
director Glaser's "Miami Vice"
episodes such tours de force is
nowhere to be seen here. While
watching the tiresome, murky scenes
of the Everglades, I couldn't help
but think, "You belong to the city,
guys." But things don't even pick up
when the flick relocates to Miami;
the script just gets sillier.

Naturally there are a host of rock
songs on the soundtrack. But with
the exception of Bob Dylan's
raunchy sounding title track (that
Dylan did the theme for a movie like
this — how the mighty have fallen),
all the music seemed so bland and

anonymous that I almost mistook it
for the piped-in Muzak of the movie
theatre.
By the end of the movie our
heroes are comrades-in-arms;
they've overcome their racial differ
ences and petty feuds to become an

efficient strike force. This does not
bode well. In the unlikely event that
"Band of the Hand" is a hit, there
could easily be a sequel. The very
thought makes me queasy. Or
maybe — get this — it could be
made into a weekly TV series. Every

week the heroes could go after a dif
ferent Miami drug dealer, while rock
songs play in the background. But
no, a program like that could never
get on the air. The very idea is too
ludicrous to even consider. (Or is
it?)


In one of the more — chilling? absurd? — scenes of Paul Michael
Glaser's "Band of the Hand," four street youths (Michael Carmine,

negotiate an unyielding Everglades swamp.

out of a house. Perhaps inspired by a
certain TV show, they paint their
house in cool pastel colors. They
beat up a pimp. The pimp goes run
ning to his boss, a big-time drug
dealer. This drug dealer has his men
attack our heroes, and Joe Tiger gets
blown away. Our heroes, being a
spunky group of youngsters, respond
by shooting the drug dealer. In a rip
roaring climax, they blow up the
plant where the drug dealer
processes his multi-million dollar
drug supply.
If this sounds like fun, be warned
that "Band of the Hand" is deadly
dull viewing. The script's leaden
pace isn't helped by the fact that not
one of the characters is very likable,
or even very interesting. Joe Tiger is
mildly amusing since he places the
movie firmly in comic book terri
tory, but the juveniles who are
supposed to be our funky heroes are
a singularly charmless bunch. Not
that any of them even look like
juveniles anyway.
The inventiveness that made
director Glaser's "Miami Vice"
episodes such tours de force is
nowhere to be seen here. While
watching the tiresome, murky scenes
of the Everglades, I couldn't help
but think, "You belong to the city,
guys." But things don't even pick up
when the flick relocates to Miami;
the script just gets sillier.

Naturally there are a host of rock
songs on the soundtrack. But with
the exception of Bob Dylan's
raunchy sounding title track (that
Dylan did the theme for a movie like
this — how the mighty have fallen),
all the music seemed so bland and

anonymous that I almost mistook it
for the piped-in Muzak of the movie
theatre.
By the end of the movie our
heroes are comrades-in-arms;
they've overcome their racial differ
ences and petty feuds to become an

efficient strike force. This does not
bode well. In the unlikely event that
"Band of the Hand" is a hit, there
could easily be a sequel. The very
thought makes me queasy. Or
maybe — get this — it could be
made into a weekly TV series. Every

week the heroes could go after a dif
ferent Miami drug dealer, while rock
songs play in the background. But
no, a program like that could never
get on the air. The very idea is too
ludicrous to even consider. (Or is
it?)

< It's time for me to come clean. As

; the innumerable crazed Colombian

' ecutive producer and stylistic guru.

; television programs to be hip. Mann
. has now brought a feature film to the
j big screen, "Band of the Hand,"
• which — surprise, surprise — is set
! in Miami and deals with the drug
| trade.
In addition to Mann, one other
| key "Vice" staffer worked on "Band
• of the Hand": none other than Paul
! Michael Glaser, director of such
"Vice" meisterworks as "Smuggler's
Blues" and the two-hour season
premiere last fall. With Mann and
Glaser at the helm, how could
"Band of the Hand" fail to be any
thing but a landmark of modern
cinema?
But alas, the celebrated Crockett
and Tubbs would hang their heads in
shame if they ever saw this movie.
"Band of the Hand" is a veritable
catastrophe of mediocrity. Michael
Mann, how could you do this to me?
Maybe I should've taken the movie's
inane title as a warning as to how
bad it would be. But no, I innocently
strolled into the theatre, expecting at
least to luxuriate in some pretty
colors and sharp compositions. In
stead I was confronted with a film

whose sheer preposterousness is
matched only by its yawn-enforcing
dullness.
The script is a disaster, of course.
The scenario conceived by Leo
Garen and Jack Baran plays like
some bizarre new form of avant
garde comedy. A group of incor
rigible juvenile offenders is taken
out of prison by federal authorities
and unceremoniously dumped in the
middle of the Everglades. There
they meet the rugged Joe Tiger
(Stephen Lang), a Vietnam vet
whose current mission is to teach
these bad boys how to survive out in
the wilds. He trains them until they
are a tough, self-reliant fighting unit.
This rather odd rehabilitation pro
gram gets progressively stranger as
Tiger leads his team of juveniles out
of the Everglades and back to
Miami. They go to a slum and kick
some drug dealers and prostitutes
out of a house. Perhaps inspired by a
certain TV show, they paint their
house in cool pastel colors. They
beat up a pimp. The pimp goes run
ning to his boss, a big-time drug
dealer. This drug dealer has his men
