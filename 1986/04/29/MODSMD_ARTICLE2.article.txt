# Johnson continues suit on U.S. defense
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Clifford Johnson's eduction and vocation have
given him an intimate knowledge of computers. His
concern over U.S. deployment of nuclear missiles
in Western Europe supplied him with the motiva
tion.
The result: a unique suit against Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger charging that the com
mitment to fire missiles as soon as computers warn
of an attack on the United States is unconstitu
tional.
With this launch-on-warning capability
(LOWC), nuclear weapons would be launched au
tomatically in response to a computer-generated
warning of attacking missiles, regardless of whether
humans had confirmed whether hostilities had
begun with another country.
LOWC has two fundamental flaws, according to
Johnson.
First, it is unconstitutional because it delegates to
a computer the Congressional authority to declare

war. Johnson contends that a nuclear strike is tan
tamount to a declaration of war.
Second, the possibility of computer error is so
high that the system is a virtual blueprint for an-'
nihilation.
"If nuclear missiles are launched, people will die.
My life is threatened," said the 36-year-old com
puter manager at Stanford's Information Technol
ogy Services. "It makes sense for an ordinary per
son to bring up the case, an 'of the people, for the
people' thing."
The suit, first filed Feb. 29, 1984, was dismissed
later that year on the grounds that the question of
how the military deals with the threat of nuclear
war is political and therefore outside the court's
jurisdiction.
Johnson appealed, and on July 10, 1985, a panel
of three judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap
peals upheld the lower court's dismissal.
Judges Warren Ferguson, William Norris and
Charles Wiggins said concrete legal issues, not
abstractions, are required to adjudicate constitu
tional issues.

Because Johnson "has not alleged that LOWC is
even technically feasible, much less that its use has
been adopted as official policy or implemented . ..
TWC'ase or controversy was- before the district
court," according to the federal judges.
Johnson, who plans to refile his suit at the end of
May, said he views those words as advice. The
revised claim, still in draft form, includes allega
tions that LOWC is not only technically feasible
but also constantly maintained by the United
States.
"The highlight of the court proceedings was the
oral hearing." Johnson said, noting that the judges
were obviously intrigued.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Penrose main
tained throughout the hearing that the suit was not
under the jurisdiction of the court because it dealt
with military and diplomatic issues that are the re
sponsibility of the executive branch of the govern
ment.
The federal judges peppered him with questions
about the constitutional power of the
president and Congress to declare
war.
"I thought the Constitution was
clear that only Congress can declare
war,'' said Judge Norris, adding that
Penrose was not dealing with
Johnson's basic theory that the deci
sion to strike will be turned over to a
computer and taken out of human
hands.
"The decision to implement this
capability (LOWC) is in itself a deci
sion to engage in nuclear combat ...
and that's effectively a declaration of
war, and the president has taken that
without the approval of Congress,"
Norris said. "Doesn't the implemen
tation of this system require the ap
proval of Congress?"
A system like LOWC would
necessarily have the approval of
Congress since the legislative body
would have approved the funding for
its development and maintainence,
Penrose replied.
Judge Ferguson retorted: "There
are 20 million cases on the books"
showing that congressional ap
propriation of money for a project is
not equivalent to congressional ap
proval of how it is spent.
Johnson recently said that although
he was pleased that the judges took
the case seriously, "I haven't won

yet."
Lawyers around the nation agree
that Johnson is not likely to win his
suit.
The case is unprecedented, accord
ing to Stanford Law Prof. Paul Brest.
"There is almost no law, no case,
on the delegation issue," Brest said.
"The issues he is raising are going to
be pretty novel for any court."
Arthur Miller, professor of consti
tutional law at George Washington
University said, "Courts are
notoriously reluctant to get into such
matters. They'll find any way possible
to slip out of judging on foreign and
military affairs."
The claim Johnson plans to file
next month asserts that "total
reliance on machines with the power
to launch nuclear weapons un
dermines the president's ability to
make competent decisions and exer
cise his congressional powers," said
Daniel Arbess, executive director of
the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear
Policy.
"U.S. foreign policy is heavily
premised on collective decision
making. Even when acting
defensively, against a nuclear attack
for example, the president must still
resort to certain mechanics of col
lective decision making," Arbess ex
plained.
With LOWC, "The United States
is predelegating its decision making,"
he said.
The New York-based Lawyers

Committee is considering sponsor
ship of Johnson's suit, according to
Arbess. "It's safe to say that we'll
provide some sort of assistance," he
said.

Miller is preparing a supporting
memorandum discussing the merits of
the case, and Robert Aldridge, a
former weapons designer for
Lockheed, is writing a paper on the
technical details of LOWC. Both doc
uments will be submitted to the com
mittee's board of directors, which will
make its decision Thursday.
Computer Professionals for Social

Responsibility, headquartered in Palo
Alto, has already endorsed Johnson's
suit.
While his supporters agree with
Johnson that predelegation is uncon
stitutional, whether the courts will
agree is quite another matter.
Unless Johnson can prove the exis
tence of L.OWC, he doesn't have a
case. Once he's proven that, he must
prove that it's error-prone and un
constitutional.
Aside from the question of court
jurisdiction over political issues, an
other obstacle for the case is the De
partment of Defense's insistance that
it does not have a launch-on-warning
policy.
"We do not rely on computer
warnings to make such crucial deci
sions, and we certainly do not have
automated launch of missiles," said
DOD spokesman Richard Ziegler.
"We are not on a hair trigger to
launch our missiles."
Johnson, who is representing him
self and has done all the legal re
search for the case, says he has scores
of documents contradicting that offi
cial stand.
A 1980 congressional report by
Senators Gary Hart (D-Col.) and
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), "Recent
False Alerts From the Nation's
Missile Attack Warning System,"
warns that computerized attack warn
ings may be erroneously generated
and relates two notorious false alerts.
The report claims that LOWC exists

and is a routine condition of the U.S.
forces.
Although the DOD won't openly
admit it has an automated defense
policy, "Put the technologies to
gether, and you see the United States
will have it soon if they don't
already," Aldridge told the publica
tion In These Times.
While the DOD says human judg
ment will always play a decisive role
in launching nuclear weapons,
Aldridge said, "with such a short time
(to make a decision), [decision
makers] don't have time to go
through communications. The com
puter says 'launch', and they'll
launch," he said.
In a February 1984 statement
prepared for Congress, Under
secretary of Defense for Policy Fred
like cautioned that the continued ca
pability to respond to a nuclear strike
implied that computer assessments
would "govern a decision whether to
fire these atomic weapons that could
destroy the human species."
Johnson also said he believes the
Stategic Defense Initiative is based
completely on the LOWC concept.
like acknowledges in his statement
that the SDI defense would be trig
gered automatically since it requires
that missiles be destroyed before they
hit the United States and therefore
might accidentally activate.
Even more than the uncon
stitutionality of LOWC, the possibil
ity of an erroneous warning alarms

Johnson.
The Hart-Goldwater report cites
two of the hundreds of false alarms
that have been generated by the U.S.
computerized warning system.
In November 1979, missile crews
were alerted and fighter planes were
launched to shoot down nonexistent
missiles because a war games com
puter tape was interpreted as an ac
tual attack.
In June 1980, the presidential
plane was readied, 100 bomber crews
were scrambeld to start their engines
and missiles were prepared for launch
because a single 46-cent computer
chip occasionally generated the digit
"2" instead of the digit "0."
"AH it takes is one bad chip,"
Johnson said. "So far, we've been
lucky. Humans have had time to
assess the reality of the situation and
stop the launch before disaster. How
much longer can we be so lucky?"
The automated launch system is
becoming increasingly sophisticated,
and the time between warning and
launch has rapidly decreased, from
approximately 10 minutes to 90
seconds, according to Johnson.
"That's not enought time to make a
decision," he said. "Humans just
can't verify whether the warning is
justified or if it's erroneous. They'll
just let the computer go ahead and
launch.
"The world could be destroyed be
cause people trusted computers too
much."

Penrose was not dealing with
Johnson's basic theory that the deci
sion to strike will be turned over to a
computer and taken out of human
hands.
"The decision to implement this
capability (LOWC) is in itself a deci
sion to engage in nuclear combat ...
and that's effectively a declaration of
war, and the president has taken that
without the approval of Congress,"
Norris said. "Doesn't the implemen
tation of this system require the ap
proval of Congress?"
A system like LOWC would
necessarily have the approval of
Congress since the legislative body
would have approved the funding for
its development and maintainence,
Penrose replied.
Judge Ferguson retorted: "There
are 20 million cases on the books"
showing that congressional ap
propriation of money for a project is
not equivalent to congressional ap
proval of how it is spent.
Johnson recently said that although
he was pleased that the judges took
the case seriously, "I haven't won

yet."
Lawyers around the nation agree
that Johnson is not likely to win his
suit.
The case is unprecedented, accord
ing to Stanford Law Prof. Paul Brest.
"There is almost no law, no case,
on the delegation issue," Brest said.
"The issues he is raising are going to
be pretty novel for any court."
Arthur Miller, professor of consti
tutional law at George Washington
University said, "Courts are
notoriously reluctant to get into such
matters. They'll find any way possible
to slip out of judging on foreign and
military affairs."
The claim Johnson plans to file
next month asserts that "total
reliance on machines with the power
to launch nuclear weapons un
dermines the president's ability to
make competent decisions and exer
cise his congressional powers," said
Daniel Arbess, executive director of
the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear
Policy.
"U.S. foreign policy is heavily
premised on collective decision
making. Even when acting
defensively, against a nuclear attack
for example, the president must still
resort to certain mechanics of col
lective decision making," Arbess ex
plained.
With LOWC, "The United States
is predelegating its decision making,"
he said.
The New York-based Lawyers

Committee is considering sponsor
ship of Johnson's suit, according to
Arbess. "It's safe to say that we'll
provide some sort of assistance," he
said.

Miller is preparing a supporting
memorandum discussing the merits of
the case, and Robert Aldridge, a
former weapons designer for
Lockheed, is writing a paper on the
technical details of LOWC. Both doc
uments will be submitted to the com
mittee's board of directors, which will
make its decision Thursday.
Computer Professionals for Social

Responsibility, headquartered in Palo
Alto, has already endorsed Johnson's
suit.
While his supporters agree with
Johnson that predelegation is uncon
stitutional, whether the courts will
agree is quite another matter.
Unless Johnson can prove the exis
tence of L.OWC, he doesn't have a
case. Once he's proven that, he must
prove that it's error-prone and un
constitutional.
Aside from the question of court
jurisdiction over political issues, an
other obstacle for the case is the De
partment of Defense's insistance that
it does not have a launch-on-warning
policy.
"We do not rely on computer
warnings to make such crucial deci
sions, and we certainly do not have
automated launch of missiles," said
DOD spokesman Richard Ziegler.
"We are not on a hair trigger to
launch our missiles."
Johnson, who is representing him
self and has done all the legal re
search for the case, says he has scores
of documents contradicting that offi
cial stand.
A 1980 congressional report by
Senators Gary Hart (D-Col.) and
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), "Recent
False Alerts From the Nation's
Missile Attack Warning System,"
warns that computerized attack warn
ings may be erroneously generated
and relates two notorious false alerts.
The report claims that LOWC exists

and is a routine condition of the U.S.
forces.
Although the DOD won't openly
admit it has an automated defense
policy, "Put the technologies to
gether, and you see the United States
will have it soon if they don't
already," Aldridge told the publica
tion In These Times.
While the DOD says human judg
ment will always play a decisive role
in launching nuclear weapons,
Aldridge said, "with such a short time
(to make a decision), [decision
makers] don't have time to go
through communications. The com
puter says 'launch', and they'll
launch," he said.
In a February 1984 statement
prepared for Congress, Under
secretary of Defense for Policy Fred
like cautioned that the continued ca
pability to respond to a nuclear strike
implied that computer assessments
would "govern a decision whether to
fire these atomic weapons that could
destroy the human species."
Johnson also said he believes the
Stategic Defense Initiative is based
completely on the LOWC concept.
like acknowledges in his statement
that the SDI defense would be trig
gered automatically since it requires
that missiles be destroyed before they
hit the United States and therefore
might accidentally activate.
Even more than the uncon
stitutionality of LOWC, the possibil
ity of an erroneous warning alarms

Johnson.
The Hart-Goldwater report cites
two of the hundreds of false alarms
that have been generated by the U.S.
computerized warning system.
In November 1979, missile crews
were alerted and fighter planes were
launched to shoot down nonexistent
missiles because a war games com
puter tape was interpreted as an ac
tual attack.
In June 1980, the presidential
plane was readied, 100 bomber crews
were scrambeld to start their engines
and missiles were prepared for launch
because a single 46-cent computer
chip occasionally generated the digit
"2" instead of the digit "0."
"AH it takes is one bad chip,"
Johnson said. "So far, we've been
lucky. Humans have had time to
assess the reality of the situation and
stop the launch before disaster. How
much longer can we be so lucky?"
The automated launch system is
becoming increasingly sophisticated,
and the time between warning and
launch has rapidly decreased, from
approximately 10 minutes to 90
seconds, according to Johnson.
"That's not enought time to make a
decision," he said. "Humans just
can't verify whether the warning is
justified or if it's erroneous. They'll
just let the computer go ahead and
launch.
"The world could be destroyed be
cause people trusted computers too
much."


Clifford Johnson
Will refile suit next month
Clifford Johnson's eduction and vocation have
given him an intimate knowledge of computers. His
concern over U.S. deployment of nuclear missiles
in Western Europe supplied him with the motiva
tion.
The result: a unique suit against Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger charging that the com
mitment to fire missiles as soon as computers warn
of an attack on the United States is unconstitu
tional.
With this launch-on-warning capability
(LOWC), nuclear weapons would be launched au
tomatically in response to a computer-generated
warning of attacking missiles, regardless of whether
humans had confirmed whether hostilities had
begun with another country.
LOWC has two fundamental flaws, according to
Johnson.
First, it is unconstitutional because it delegates to
a computer the Congressional authority to declare

war. Johnson contends that a nuclear strike is tan
tamount to a declaration of war.
Second, the possibility of computer error is so
high that the system is a virtual blueprint for an-'
nihilation.
"If nuclear missiles are launched, people will die.
My life is threatened," said the 36-year-old com
puter manager at Stanford's Information Technol
ogy Services. "It makes sense for an ordinary per
son to bring up the case, an 'of the people, for the
people' thing."
The suit, first filed Feb. 29, 1984, was dismissed
later that year on the grounds that the question of
how the military deals with the threat of nuclear
war is political and therefore outside the court's
jurisdiction.
Johnson appealed, and on July 10, 1985, a panel
of three judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap
peals upheld the lower court's dismissal.
Judges Warren Ferguson, William Norris and
Charles Wiggins said concrete legal issues, not
abstractions, are required to adjudicate constitu
tional issues.

Because Johnson "has not alleged that LOWC is
even technically feasible, much less that its use has
been adopted as official policy or implemented . ..
TWC'ase or controversy was- before the district
court," according to the federal judges.
Johnson, who plans to refile his suit at the end of
May, said he views those words as advice. The
revised claim, still in draft form, includes allega
tions that LOWC is not only technically feasible
but also constantly maintained by the United
States.
"The highlight of the court proceedings was the
oral hearing." Johnson said, noting that the judges
were obviously intrigued.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Penrose main
tained throughout the hearing that the suit was not
under the jurisdiction of the court because it dealt
with military and diplomatic issues that are the re
sponsibility of the executive branch of the govern
ment.
The federal judges peppered him with questions
about the constitutional power of the
president and Congress to declare
war.
"I thought the Constitution was

Johnson that predelegation is uncon
stitutional, whether the courts will
agree is quite another matter.
Unless Johnson can prove the exis
tence of L.OWC, he doesn't have a
case. Once he's proven that, he must
prove that it's error-prone and un
constitutional.
Aside from the question of court
jurisdiction over political issues, an
other obstacle for the case is the De
partment of Defense's insistance that
it does not have a launch-on-warning
policy.
"We do not rely on computer
warnings to make such crucial deci
sions, and we certainly do not have
automated launch of missiles," said
DOD spokesman Richard Ziegler.
"We are not on a hair trigger to
launch our missiles."
Johnson, who is representing him
self and has done all the legal re
search for the case, says he has scores
of documents contradicting that offi
cial stand.
A 1980 congressional report by
Senators Gary Hart (D-Col.) and
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), "Recent
False Alerts From the Nation's
Missile Attack Warning System,"
warns that computerized attack warn
ings may be erroneously generated
and relates two notorious false alerts.
The report claims that LOWC exists

and is a routine condition of the U.S.
forces.
Although the DOD won't openly
admit it has an automated defense
policy, "Put the technologies to
gether, and you see the United States
will have it soon if they don't
already," Aldridge told the publica
tion In These Times.
While the DOD says human judg
ment will always play a decisive role
in launching nuclear weapons,
Aldridge said, "with such a short time
(to make a decision), [decision
makers] don't have time to go
through communications. The com
puter says 'launch', and they'll
launch," he said.
In a February 1984 statement
prepared for Congress, Under
secretary of Defense for Policy Fred
like cautioned that the continued ca
pability to respond to a nuclear strike
implied that computer assessments
would "govern a decision whether to
fire these atomic weapons that could
destroy the human species."
Johnson also said he believes the
Stategic Defense Initiative is based
completely on the LOWC concept.
like acknowledges in his statement
that the SDI defense would be trig
gered automatically since it requires
that missiles be destroyed before they
hit the United States and therefore
might accidentally activate.
Even more than the uncon
stitutionality of LOWC, the possibil
ity of an erroneous warning alarms

Johnson.
The Hart-Goldwater report cites
two of the hundreds of false alarms
that have been generated by the U.S.
computerized warning system.
In November 1979, missile crews
were alerted and fighter planes were
launched to shoot down nonexistent
missiles because a war games com
puter tape was interpreted as an ac
tual attack.
In June 1980, the presidential
plane was readied, 100 bomber crews
were scrambeld to start their engines
and missiles were prepared for launch
because a single 46-cent computer
chip occasionally generated the digit
"2" instead of the digit "0."
"AH it takes is one bad chip,"
Johnson said. "So far, we've been
lucky. Humans have had time to
assess the reality of the situation and
stop the launch before disaster. How
much longer can we be so lucky?"
The automated launch system is
becoming increasingly sophisticated,
and the time between warning and
launch has rapidly decreased, from
approximately 10 minutes to 90
seconds, according to Johnson.
"That's not enought time to make a
decision," he said. "Humans just
can't verify whether the warning is
justified or if it's erroneous. They'll
just let the computer go ahead and
launch.
"The world could be destroyed be
cause people trusted computers too
much."


Clifford Johnson
Will refile suit next month
Clifford Johnson's eduction and vocation have
given him an intimate knowledge of computers. His
concern over U.S. deployment of nuclear missiles
in Western Europe supplied him with the motiva
tion.
The result: a unique suit against Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger charging that the com
mitment to fire missiles as soon as computers warn
of an attack on the United States is unconstitu
tional.
With this launch-on-warning capability
(LOWC), nuclear weapons would be launched au
tomatically in response to a computer-generated
warning of attacking missiles, regardless of whether
humans had confirmed whether hostilities had
begun with another country.
LOWC has two fundamental flaws, according to
Johnson.
First, it is unconstitutional because it delegates to
a computer the Congressional authority to declare

war. Johnson contends that a nuclear strike is tan
tamount to a declaration of war.
Second, the possibility of computer error is so
high that the system is a virtual blueprint for an-'
nihilation.
"If nuclear missiles are launched, people will die.
My life is threatened," said the 36-year-old com
puter manager at Stanford's Information Technol
ogy Services. "It makes sense for an ordinary per
son to bring up the case, an 'of the people, for the
people' thing."
The suit, first filed Feb. 29, 1984, was dismissed
later that year on the grounds that the question of
how the military deals with the threat of nuclear
war is political and therefore outside the court's
jurisdiction.
Johnson appealed, and on July 10, 1985, a panel
of three judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap
peals upheld the lower court's dismissal.
Judges Warren Ferguson, William Norris and
Charles Wiggins said concrete legal issues, not
abstractions, are required to adjudicate constitu
tional issues.

Because Johnson "has not alleged that LOWC is
even technically feasible, much less that its use has
been adopted as official policy or implemented . ..
TWC'ase or controversy was- before the district
court," according to the federal judges.
Johnson, who plans to refile his suit at the end of
May, said he views those words as advice. The
revised claim, still in draft form, includes allega
tions that LOWC is not only technically feasible
but also constantly maintained by the United
States.
"The highlight of the court proceedings was the
oral hearing." Johnson said, noting that the judges
were obviously intrigued.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Penrose main
tained throughout the hearing that the suit was not
under the jurisdiction of the court because it dealt
with military and diplomatic issues that are the re
sponsibility of the executive branch of the govern
ment.
The federal judges peppered him with questions
about the constitutional power of the
president and Congress to declare
war.
"I thought the Constitution was
clear that only Congress can declare
war,'' said Judge Norris, adding that
Penrose was not dealing with
Johnson's basic theory that the deci
sion to strike will be turned over to a
computer and taken out of human
hands.
"The decision to implement this
capability (LOWC) is in itself a deci
sion to engage in nuclear combat ...
and that's effectively a declaration of
war, and the president has taken that
without the approval of Congress,"
Norris said. "Doesn't the implemen
tation of this system require the ap
proval of Congress?"
A system like LOWC would
necessarily have the approval of
Congress since the legislative body
would have approved the funding for
its development and maintainence,
Penrose replied.
Judge Ferguson retorted: "There
are 20 million cases on the books"
showing that congressional ap
propriation of money for a project is
not equivalent to congressional ap
proval of how it is spent.
Johnson recently said that although
he was pleased that the judges took
the case seriously, "I haven't won

yet."
Lawyers around the nation agree
that Johnson is not likely to win his
suit.
The case is unprecedented, accord
ing to Stanford Law Prof. Paul Brest.
"There is almost no law, no case,
on the delegation issue," Brest said.
"The issues he is raising are going to
be pretty novel for any court."
Arthur Miller, professor of consti
tutional law at George Washington
University said, "Courts are
notoriously reluctant to get into such
matters. They'll find any way possible
to slip out of judging on foreign and
military affairs."
The claim Johnson plans to file
next month asserts that "total
reliance on machines with the power
to launch nuclear weapons un
dermines the president's ability to
make competent decisions and exer
cise his congressional powers," said
Daniel Arbess, executive director of
the Lawyers Committee on Nuclear
Policy.
"U.S. foreign policy is heavily
premised on collective decision
making. Even when acting
defensively, against a nuclear attack
for example, the president must still
resort to certain mechanics of col
lective decision making," Arbess ex
plained.
With LOWC, "The United States
is predelegating its decision making,"
he said.
The New York-based Lawyers

Committee is considering sponsor
ship of Johnson's suit, according to
Arbess. "It's safe to say that we'll
provide some sort of assistance," he
said.

Miller is preparing a supporting
memorandum discussing the merits of
the case, and Robert Aldridge, a
former weapons designer for
Lockheed, is writing a paper on the
technical details of LOWC. Both doc
uments will be submitted to the com
mittee's board of directors, which will
make its decision Thursday.
Computer Professionals for Social

Responsibility, headquartered in Palo
Alto, has already endorsed Johnson's
suit.
While his supporters agree with
Johnson that predelegation is uncon
stitutional, whether the courts will
agree is quite another matter.

tence of L.OWC, he doesn't have a
