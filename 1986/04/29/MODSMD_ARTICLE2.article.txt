# Johnson continues suit on U.S. defense

Clifford Johnson's eduction and vocation have
given him an intimate knowledge of computers. His
concern over U.S. deployment of nuclear missiles
in Western Europe supplied him with the motiva
tion.
The result: a unique suit against Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger charging that the com
mitment to fire missiles as soon as computers warn
of an attack on the United States is unconstitu
tional.
With this launch-on-warning capability
(LOWC), nuclear weapons would be launched au
tomatically in response to a computer-generated
warning of attacking missiles, regardless of whether
humans had confirmed whether hostilities had
begun with another country.
LOWC has two fundamental flaws, according to
Johnson.
First, it is unconstitutional because it delegates to
a computer the Congressional authority to declare

war. Johnson contends that a nuclear strike is tan
tamount to a declaration of war.
Second, the possibility of computer error is so
high that the system is a virtual blueprint for an-'
nihilation.
"If nuclear missiles are launched, people will die.
My life is threatened," said the 36-year-old com
puter manager at Stanford's Information Technol
ogy Services. "It makes sense for an ordinary per
son to bring up the case, an 'of the people, for the
people' thing."
The suit, first filed Feb. 29, 1984, was dismissed
later that year on the grounds that the question of
how the military deals with the threat of nuclear
war is political and therefore outside the court's
jurisdiction.
Johnson appealed, and on July 10, 1985, a panel
of three judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap
peals upheld the lower court's dismissal.
Judges Warren Ferguson, William Norris and
Charles Wiggins said concrete legal issues, not
abstractions, are required to adjudicate constitu
tional issues.

Because Johnson "has not alleged that LOWC is
even technically feasible, much less that its use has
been adopted as official policy or implemented . ..
TWC'ase or controversy was- before the district
court," according to the federal judges.
Johnson, who plans to refile his suit at the end of
May, said he views those words as advice. The
revised claim, still in draft form, includes allega
tions that LOWC is not only technically feasible
but also constantly maintained by the United
States.
"The highlight of the court proceedings was the
oral hearing." Johnson said, noting that the judges
were obviously intrigued.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John Penrose main
tained throughout the hearing that the suit was not
under the jurisdiction of the court because it dealt
with military and diplomatic issues that are the re
sponsibility of the executive branch of the govern
ment.
The federal judges peppered him with questions
