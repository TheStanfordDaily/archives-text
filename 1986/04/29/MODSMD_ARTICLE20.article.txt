# Berkeley modernizes 'Twelfth Night'
## 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
Q: What do the Three Stooges, a
Mozartean opera, a gramophone with
legs, iambic pentameter verse and a
10-foot-taJl priest all have in com
mon?
A: They are all part of the
Berkeley Repertory Theatre's pro
duction of Shakespeare's "Twelfth
Night." This, the final show of the
Rep's season, is one of the most en
tertaining shows I have seen all year,
and without a doubt a fantastic op
portunity for anyone from seven to
70 to see why Shakespeare is consid
ered the world's greatest playwright.
It's a fantastic opportunity, because
it seems to me that Shakespeare, like
opera and wine tasting, has this in
timidating aura around him of being
"cultured," "classical," and (dare I
say it?) "intellectually elite." You
know, one of the guys you read for
Western Culture ... famous for
poetry and tragical heroes who have
tragical flaws ... the kind of guy who
has no qualms about using words like
"bodkin" and "fardels." And despite
all the professors who tell you other
wise, Shakespeare always seems an
cient, very good in his day but some
how distant from us moderns. We
read one or two of his plays and then
stuff his "Complete Works" high up
on the shelf next to Homer's
"Odyssey" and "Paradise Lost."
Everyone has a copy of "Hamlet,"
but it's the newest Spielberg movie
that really turns us on.
And rightly so. Most often, local
Shakespeare shows are badly done
and terribly dull to watch. And inter
nationally, we only know about
Laurence Olivier musically rolling his
"r"s with an upper-class English ac
cent in movies made 40 years ago. In
other words, if you've seen a good
Shakespearean show it's probably
been one of the heavy tragedies. No
wonder all us cultural hoi polloi turn
to Eddie Murphy for our laughs:
Shakespearean "comedies" just have
a lousy track record in pop culture.
Why waste the money?
Well, the Berkeley Rep has a show
hat dispels all the mythology of The
lard as an intellectual Olympian who
x mast revere but fail to understand
r enjoy. And it's also worth every
enny of the ticket price.
You don't even get the chance to
:t highbrow, to savor the metrics, to
lalyze the mixing of genres. Nope,

right frojn the opening moments,
director Sharon Ott sets a tone of fun
and festivity. "Twelfth Night" is a
rollicking comedy that takes its title
from the holiday marking the end of
the Christmas season revels, and
Ott's staging immediately lets you
know that silliness, chaos and enjoy
ment reign on stage. The period is
"La Belle Epoque" (1890-1914
roughly), and its elegant decadence
seethes with silly music, white-faced
clowns and new-fangled gadgets (like
gramophones and bicycles).
The plot revolves around the old
(by now) comic device of a woman
dressing as a man in order to get
closer to the guy she loves. Unfortun
ately, the guy is in love with another
woman. And (surprise) this woman
falls in love with the woman playing a
man. Add to this three raucous
clowns playing jokes on an intense
Puritan, a late entrance by the dis
guised woman's identical twin and a
melancholy, merry Fool helping them
all, and you have "Twelfth Night."
Confusing?
Not at all — on the Rep's stage,
anyway. This is what is so exciting
about the show: you understand ex

actly who everyone is, what they want
and how they are going about getting
it. Who cares if it's Elizabethan? The
clarity of the words and the silliness
of the actions (from Keystone Kop
crashes to squirt guns) suck the audi
ence into a stage spirit best sum
marized as just cutting loose and
having some fun. Which is great in
any show, Shakespearean or other
wise.
This is an ensemble piece, and to
select individual performances as out
standing is inappropriate. Suffice to
say that the clowns (Lawrence Bal
lard and Charles Dean) are hilarious,
the nobles (Michelle Morain and
James Carpenter) are romantically
funny, and Feste the Fool (Jeffrey
Bihr and Ginna Leishman; yes, there
are two fools for the price of one)
binds everyone together with a lyrical
quality that shifts between happy and
sad throughout the play. As far as
design goes, the Rep has the most
beautiful productions in the Bay
Area. The haunting moon that
radiates in the darkness of each
opening scene and the superb musical
score are particularly strong points.
And as mentioned, Ott has filled

the stage with a vision that overflows
with playful ideas. The focus on the
Fool, in particular, with his juggling,
mime, ventriloquisni and acrobatics
produces the most startling and in
spiring images. She has capped off
her second season as the Rep's artis
tic director as magnificently as she did
her first: last year's "Tooth of Crime"
has actually been matched in spirit,
lavishness and theatricality with this
year's "Twelfth Night." The cast,
designers and director are bursting
with a thorough enjoyment of their
job, and it floods from the stage onto
the audience.
One final note about the produc
tion (digressing to a "critical" atti
tude for a moment): it is not simply
an entertaining comedy. As with
other shows this season, the Rep has
not settled for a merely palatable pro
duction to please their subscribers.
The show ends very soberly (both
literally and figuratively), and the
program note about the end of the
revels, the end of the Twelfth Night
holiday, puts this in perspective for
those who expect a tidy, happy end
ing. The sobriety doesn't discredit all
the merriment that has gone on
before. It is merely the natural and
necessary end of the merriment as the
long winter sets in after Christmas.
Death follows life, and so too does
the melancholy fool, the 'Teste" of
the "Festival," remind us about the
nature of life, love and time in his
final song.
But the contrast of this with the
out-and-out madness that has
preceded it works wonderfully. The
show captures the broadest comedy
and the most lyrical melancholy. It is
a festival of fun, and all people who
feel intimidated by Shakespeare have
a great chance to get over their fears
with this show. I never thought I'd be
a Gene Shalit and say "Run — don't
walk — to this show," but here goes:
Run — don't walk — to the Berkeley
Rep!
Tenured professors, fun-loving
freshmen, overworked staff members
— all should go and see the "Great
Bard" do what he does best: entrance
all types of people with entertaining
and moving drama. The show lasts
three hours, but it goes much too
quickly. As my friend said, "I'd wish
it was three times as long." Me, I wish
it went on forever. "Twelfth Night"
plays through June 1 with group dis
counts and half-price student tickets
available.
