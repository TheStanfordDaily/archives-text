# Show culminates lackluster season
## Talky theatrics undo ACT's 'Burning' 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
"The Lady's Not For Burning," a verse play written by Christopher Fry in
1948, opened last Tuesday night as the final show of the American Conser
vatory Theatre's 1985-86 season. While it marks the end of the season, it also
marks the beginning of a new creative philosophy at ACT. Bill Ball, who
founded and guided ACT for 20 years, has left the company and Edward Has
tings has become the new artistic director. To mark the arrival of a new, highly
ambitious spirit in the company, ACT scrapped the original entry for the
season finale (a small two-man show) and replaced it with a large play and a
large budget.
Alas, though, that philosophy does not always follow reality. It would be
nice to report that the new blood, the new play and the new budget had all
combined to turn around ACTs dull season and end it with a bang.
Unfortunately, the show is as lackluster as its predecessors, and I wonder
what is, in fact, necessary for ACT to put on just one worthwhile show.
Let me take that back. "Opera Comique," their second show, was entertain
ing. We critics tend to jump to generalities sometimes. I always take them with
a grain of salt (I'm sure you do, too). But I still fall for them from time to time.
Take the topic at hand as a case in point. I decided ACT wasn't worth it
anymore, that the drive back from the city had just been too depressing each
time I visited Geary Street, that I hated seeing a dull show and I hated even
worse having to write about it.
But, I read all this hoopla and PR about big money for real sets and
costumes (ACT has been skimping all year). And then I saw the full-page ads
in the Chronicle's pink section. And then I read some rave reviews from
people who I trust, to an extent. So I went. Some people never learn.
"The Lady's Not For Burning" is set in the 15th century and follows a mini
mal plot about a beautiful woman accused of witchcraft and sentenced to the
stake. Along with her is a young soldier who openly confesses he is the devil
and wants to be hanged. The two present themselves at the house of the
mayor; one in search of sanctuary, the other in search of the gallows. Both are
detained â€” she as a witch and he as a nut case. They end up falling in love and
escaping and live happily ever after. Along with this are a few subplots which
are stereotypical and add little to the play.
It is an extremely talky play, one relying on verbal glitter (images, metap
hors, puns, etc.) rather than plot or character. While there are ways of success
fully producing texts like these, and certainly in this play the possibilities are
numerous, the ACT production fails to do so. It is a two-and-a-half hour show
that lasts forever and holds one's interest for very little of that time. The set is
wonderful, and so are the costumes (just like they promised), but my general
impression of the acting is as it has been all year, one of smooth, well-worn
familiarity.
All of the actors are talented and have been working in regional theater and
on Broadway for years in leading roles. And somehow this seems to work to
their disadvantage at ACT. It is a cast that gets the job done, but in a routine,
expected manner. Homogeneity is substituted for spontaneity, a slick profes
sional smoothness that has everything but the spice and pizzazz of the unex
pected. The rhythm of the spoken verse, the pace of the dialogue and the en
ergy of characters entering on stage is practically the same throughout the
evening.
My editor keeps saying, "Dumping on ACT again?" Yes, well, it's true. Not
undeservedly, though, in my opinion. At the end of the show one of the actors
calls for silence and makes a pitch to subscribe to the "new ACT." If "The
Lady's Not For Burning" is indicative of this new company, count me out.
"The Lady's Not For Burning" plays through May 17 at ACT in San Fran
cisco.
