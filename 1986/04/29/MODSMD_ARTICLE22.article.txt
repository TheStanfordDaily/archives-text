## Blyth Fund offers a sound educational investment Students learn first-hand to manage a portfolio and invest big bucks

" Do you feel bullish?" one student
asked his friend. "I do, but do the rest
of you feel bullish?" the friend
replied, opening the question to gen
eral discussion.
This is not a scene from the Stan
ford Cattle Auction Club, but rather
the talk at the most recent meeting of
Stanford's student-run investment
group, the Charles R. Blyth Fund.
Besides the discussion on the cur
rent "bullish" or upward trend in
stock market prices, the most recent
Blyth Fund meeting included a stock

market and economy report as well as
a review of current events. Analyses
focused on the effects that certain
trends and world events will have
upon various financial markets.
In addition, three guests were pres
ent at the meeting who are all recent
Stanford graduates now working in
the investment, consulting and
banking fields. One of the speakers
from Bank of America gave some in
sights into the bond market.

The 18 students who gather twice a
week for this type of meeting enjoy
observing the world of high finance.
However, they also meet for a more
practical reason: to invest intel
ligently. As members of the Blyth
Fund, these students have the author
ity to invest over $65,000.
At the most recent meeting, chair
man Eric Schwartz delivered a con
vincing presentation about the
Salomon Brothers company and the
board members then voted to buy
$6,000 worth of stock in the company
on the following day.
The Blyth Fund was established to
give students the opportunity to gain
first-hand experience in managing an
investment portfolio. The board,
composed of members with various
majors and interests, learns from
each other and from the responsibil
ity of operating an investment fund.
In 1978, an anonymous donor gave
$75,000 to establish student invest
ment groups at Stanford University
and Occidental College. The money
was donated in honor of Charles R.
Blyth, an outstanding financial leader
in California and the United States.
His firm, Blyth and Company, was
respected world-wide and was
recently acquired by Paine Webber.
Responsibility for administration
and investment rests soley with board
members. The board is composed of
11 directors and seven alternates.
Only directors vote on investment
choices, but all members share re
search, presentation and investigative
duties.
Each board presides for a one-year
term that begins on April 1. The
Fund meets twice a week for a total of
about 2-1/2 hours.
The Fund's four officers are au
thorized to place orders to buy or sell
various securities, as approved by the
directors, by contacting Charles
Scwaab, the nation's largest discount
brokerage firm. Members research
topics and then present their
proposals to the group.
When Schwartz suggested investing
in Salomon Brothers, the other mem
bers interrogated him. Schwartz
managed to convince his fellow board
members that the increase in stock
activity means more business for fi
nancial service firms, and thus
Salomon Brothers' stock price should
increase from its present listing at $59
per share to the mid-60s in the next
few months.
Half of the Blyth Fund portfolio is
invested in a money market account

while the rest is held in common
stocks and a General Electric corpor
ate bond. The Fund also frequently
invests in stock options.
Jacques Antebi, the vice-chairman
of the Fund, describes his favorite
aspect of the Blyth Fund as "learning
from the other students." Though all
the current board members share an
interest in finance, they are hardly
homogeneous.
The competition for places — 100
applications for 18 spots this year —
allows the selection committee to
create a diverse board. Forty people
this year were interviewed from the
many preliminary applications that
were submitted in March. Bob Lis
bonne, past chairman of the Fund,
described what the selection commit
tee is seeking. Lisbonne stated that,
"not just one kind of person is
sought, but rather diversity is impor
tant."

Lisbonne stressed that "a sincere
interest in learning and a committ
ment to the Fund" is more necessary
than "a strong investment back
ground." When asked to state specific
factors taken into account by the se
lection committee, Lisbonne men
tioned a combination of personal in
terests, majors, summer experience
and extracurricular activities.
The current board embodies the di
versity that is sought by the applica
tion process. Mona Sedky notes that
each member "tries to explain their
own expertise so the whole group
may benefit." Indeed, members excel
in a variety of fields. ,
Robert Davenport, a petroleum
engineer, has worked for both Chev
ron and Atlantic Richfield and is
attuned to the oil market. Ted Muftic
gained experience trading in new
Eurobond issues while he interned
with the Creditanstalt Bankverein in

Vienna. As a marketing analyst for
the Philippine National Oil Com
pany, Eric Ramirez developed skills
and interests in foreign investment as
well as in engineering.
Other impressive internships range
from Dawn Davis' work in the Fixed
Income Research Department at
First Boston to Peg Kilmer's summer
position jn investment banking at
Merrill Lynch.

traveled and worked in Spain for a
year while Mary Thurber has just
been elected to the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Sedky has studied the im
pact of tax proposals on tax-exempt
bonds for the National School Boards
Association; Kimberly Denend has
worked in the advertising and mar
keting fields.
The Fund extends their activities

beyond Stanford primarily through
field trips and outside speakers. Prox
imity to Silicon Valley has allowed'
the Fund to interact with many high
tech firms. For instance, when the
Fund invested in Xytec, a local start--
up company, the members invited
and were visited by the firm's chief
executive officer.
Other past events have included a
tour of the Pacific Stock Exchange
and a retreat with the sister fund at
Occidental College. As evident at the
most recent meeting, speakers from
various investment fields are frequent
guests. Also, the Fund sponsors oc
casional social events, such as having
a meeting at Round Table Pizza Par
lor.
The financial success of the Blyth
Fund has been, as of yet, subtle. Last
year's Fund reported a meager 2
cent return in spite of a market rally.
One might expect that a group of
bright Stanford students could easily
outperform the market.
Schwartz commented on the
Fund's historical performance,"ln
our defense, you must realize that we
only spend a couple of hours a week
working on investments. Professional
fund managers spend 60 hours a
week; they don't have to worry about
midterms. Also, we don't have the re
sources that they do; research for us
is much harder.
"Furthermore, for many students'
on the Fund, this is their first chance
in investing. Internships and summer
jobs is (sic) one thing, investing your
own capital (or the Fund's) is an
other."
Beyond stock prices and rates of
return, the success of the Blyth Fund
is best measured by the enthusiasm
expressed by its members. Sedky
frankly explains that she is "happily
surprised" that she enjoys the Fund'
so much, and she "looks forward to
every meeting."
Phil Black notes that in his two
years on the board he has observed a
"sense of camaraderie that is
achieved as the year progresses."
Other members echoed similar senti
ments of enthusiasm, interest and
dedication.
The Blyth Fund offers bright and
energetic Stanford students the op
portunity to manage a portfolio: that
is they must research, invest and ac
count for over $65,000. In the
process, all members, regardless of
past experience or future plans, learn
more about the world of finance and
have fun doing so.

This is not a scene from the Stan

the talk at the most recent meeting of
Stanford's student-run investment
group, the Charles R. Blyth Fund.

market and economy report as well as
a review of current events. Analyses
focused on the effects that certain
trends and world events will have
upon various financial markets.
In addition, three guests were pres
ent at the meeting who are all recent
Stanford graduates now working in
the investment, consulting and
banking fields. One of the speakers
from Bank of America gave some in
sights into the bond market.

The 18 students who gather twice a
week for this type of meeting enjoy
observing the world of high finance.
However, they also meet for a more
practical reason: to invest intel
ligently. As members of the Blyth
Fund, these students have the author
ity to invest over $65,000.
At the most recent meeting, chair
man Eric Schwartz delivered a con
vincing presentation about the
Salomon Brothers company and the
board members then voted to buy
$6,000 worth of stock in the company
on the following day.
The Blyth Fund was established to
give students the opportunity to gain
first-hand experience in managing an
investment portfolio. The board,
composed of members with various
majors and interests, learns from
each other and from the responsibil
ity of operating an investment fund.
In 1978, an anonymous donor gave
$75,000 to establish student invest
ment groups at Stanford University
and Occidental College. The money
was donated in honor of Charles R.
Blyth, an outstanding financial leader
in California and the United States.
His firm, Blyth and Company, was
respected world-wide and was
recently acquired by Paine Webber.
Responsibility for administration
and investment rests soley with board
members. The board is composed of
11 directors and seven alternates.
Only directors vote on investment
choices, but all members share re
search, presentation and investigative
duties.
Each board presides for a one-year
term that begins on April 1. The
Fund meets twice a week for a total of
about 2-1/2 hours.
The Fund's four officers are au
thorized to place orders to buy or sell
various securities, as approved by the
directors, by contacting Charles
Scwaab, the nation's largest discount
brokerage firm. Members research
topics and then present their
proposals to the group.
When Schwartz suggested investing
in Salomon Brothers, the other mem
bers interrogated him. Schwartz
managed to convince his fellow board
members that the increase in stock
activity means more business for fi
nancial service firms, and thus
Salomon Brothers' stock price should
increase from its present listing at $59
per share to the mid-60s in the next
few months.
Half of the Blyth Fund portfolio is
invested in a money market account

while the rest is held in common
stocks and a General Electric corpor
ate bond. The Fund also frequently
invests in stock options.
Jacques Antebi, the vice-chairman
of the Fund, describes his favorite
aspect of the Blyth Fund as "learning
from the other students." Though all
the current board members share an
interest in finance, they are hardly
homogeneous.
The competition for places — 100
applications for 18 spots this year —
allows the selection committee to
create a diverse board. Forty people
this year were interviewed from the
many preliminary applications that
were submitted in March. Bob Lis
bonne, past chairman of the Fund,
described what the selection commit
tee is seeking. Lisbonne stated that,
"not just one kind of person is
sought, but rather diversity is impor
tant."

Lisbonne stressed that "a sincere
interest in learning and a committ
ment to the Fund" is more necessary
than "a strong investment back
ground." When asked to state specific
factors taken into account by the se
lection committee, Lisbonne men
tioned a combination of personal in
terests, majors, summer experience
and extracurricular activities.
The current board embodies the di
versity that is sought by the applica
tion process. Mona Sedky notes that
each member "tries to explain their
own expertise so the whole group
may benefit." Indeed, members excel
in a variety of fields. ,
Robert Davenport, a petroleum
engineer, has worked for both Chev
ron and Atlantic Richfield and is
attuned to the oil market. Ted Muftic
gained experience trading in new
Eurobond issues while he interned
with the Creditanstalt Bankverein in

Vienna. As a marketing analyst for
the Philippine National Oil Com
pany, Eric Ramirez developed skills
and interests in foreign investment as
well as in engineering.

bonds for the National School Boards
Association; Kimberly Denend has
worked in the advertising and mar
keting fields.
The Fund extends their activities

beyond Stanford primarily through
field trips and outside speakers. Prox
imity to Silicon Valley has allowed'
the Fund to interact with many high
tech firms. For instance, when the
Fund invested in Xytec, a local start--
up company, the members invited
and were visited by the firm's chief
executive officer.
Other past events have included a
tour of the Pacific Stock Exchange
and a retreat with the sister fund at
Occidental College. As evident at the
most recent meeting, speakers from
various investment fields are frequent
guests. Also, the Fund sponsors oc
casional social events, such as having
a meeting at Round Table Pizza Par
lor.
The financial success of the Blyth
Fund has been, as of yet, subtle. Last
year's Fund reported a meager 2
cent return in spite of a market rally.
One might expect that a group of
bright Stanford students could easily
outperform the market.
Schwartz commented on the
Fund's historical performance,"ln
our defense, you must realize that we
only spend a couple of hours a week
working on investments. Professional
fund managers spend 60 hours a
week; they don't have to worry about
midterms. Also, we don't have the re
sources that they do; research for us
is much harder.
"Furthermore, for many students'
on the Fund, this is their first chance
in investing. Internships and summer

Beyond stock prices and rates of
return, the success of the Blyth Fund
is best measured by the enthusiasm
expressed by its members. Sedky
frankly explains that she is "happily

week; they don't have to worry about
midterms. Also, we don't have the re
sources that they do; research for us
is much harder.
"Furthermore, for many students'
on the Fund, this is their first chance
in investing. Internships and summer
jobs is (sic) one thing, investing your
own capital (or the Fund's) is an
other."
Beyond stock prices and rates of
return, the success of the Blyth Fund
is best measured by the enthusiasm
expressed by its members. Sedky
frankly explains that she is "happily
surprised" that she enjoys the Fund'
so much, and she "looks forward to
every meeting."
Phil Black notes that in his two
years on the board he has observed a
"sense of camaraderie that is
achieved as the year progresses."
Other members echoed similar senti
ments of enthusiasm, interest and
dedication.
The Blyth Fund offers bright and
energetic Stanford students the op
portunity to manage a portfolio: that
is they must research, invest and ac
count for over $65,000. In the
process, all members, regardless of
past experience or future plans, learn
more about the world of finance and
have fun doing so.
