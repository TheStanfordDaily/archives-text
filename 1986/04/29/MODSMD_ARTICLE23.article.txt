## Cardinal seniors play last contest on Farm 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Just the thought of getting that extra hour of
sunlight into the day must have warmed the
heart of Stanford Coach Dick Gould.
After all, with the sun quickly setting on the
careers of four Cardinal seniors, Gould should
be cherishing any extra time with the four, who
have a total of six All-American seasons be
tween them.
Furthermore, with only two more home
matches left in the season, this will be the last
week that the quartet of Dan Goldie, Jim
Grabb, John Letts and Eric Rosenfeld will roam
the confines of the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
But forget all this sentimentality. Those
seniors still have some work to do.
If the sixth-ranked Stanford squad doesn't
win one or both of this week's matches against
Pepperdine and California, then the Cardinal
may not receive a berth in the NCAA tourna
ment.
"If we lose them both, then I think we'll have
a less than 50-50 shot at getting in," Gould said
yesterday.
In addition, the Stanford players may have
revenge on their minds for today's 1:30 p.m.
match against the fifth-ranked Waves of Pep
perdine.
Back in February, the Waves routed Stanford
by a 5 -1 score at the National Intercollegiate In
door Tennis Championships in Louisville, Ken.
In that match, the Cardinal was missing
Grabb, who was hampered by a leg injury. The
Waves took full advantage of his absence to
take five out of the six singles matches.
Once again, Grabb is recovering from a leg
pull and is an uncertainty for today. To add to
Stanford's problems, Goldie is also recovering
from an ankle injury and may not play this af
ternoon.
"I'm hopeful that we'll be able to play them
in both singles and doubles," Gould said. "But I
just don't know yet."
Regardless of Stanford injuries, Pepperdine
Coach Allen Fox will bring a host of highly

ranked players to the courts today.
Senior Kelly Jones is ranked 13th in the na
tion and .usually plays No. 1 singles for the
Waves. Jones whisked by Goldie in February by
a 6-2, 6-0 score.
Joining Jones at the top of the lineup will be
sophomore Robbie Weiss. Weiss, who sports a
record of 13-7 on the year, defeated Rosenfeld
at the No. 2 spot 6-2, 7-6 this winter.
Rounding out Pepperdine's upper echelon
are juniors Martin Laurendeau and Dani Leal.
Laurendeau is currently ranked 23rd and plays
on Canada's Davis Cup team. Leal just returned
to the Pepperdine squad last week.
Last month, Leal decided to try the profes
sional circuit, but he didn't win any money. So
with his amateur status, if not his pride, still in
tact, he returned to Pepperdine last week and
helped the Waves to victories over California
and UC-Santa Barbara.
Fox also has the nation's fifth-ranked doubles
team in his arsenal. The pair of Jones and
Moreno have teamed up to post an 8-3 record
on the year.
On the other side of the net, the Cardinal
players are coming off a weekend of mixed
results at the Pacific 10 Individual Champion
ships in Ojai.
Both Goldie and Grabb sat out and rested,
but sophomore Patrick McEnroe and junior
Scott Moody picked up the slack for Stanford.
Moody upset seventh-ranked Steve DeVries
of California in the second round of the tourna
ment before losing to USC's John Carras in the
quarterfinals.
At the same time, McEproe took revenge on
USC's sixth-ranked Luke Jensen, who had
beaten McEnroe earlier in the month. McEnroe
defeated Jensen 7-6, 6-1 before being beaten by
UCLA's Brad Pearce 6-2, 7-5.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, Rosenfeld
and Letts were defeated in the early rounds at
the championships.
Stanford will need strong performances from
all four of those players if the team is to conquer


Dan Goldie will have his hands full today when he faces Kelly
Jones of Pepperdine. Jones defeated the Cardinal senior in

Pepperdine is currently ranked fifth, Stanford sixth.
