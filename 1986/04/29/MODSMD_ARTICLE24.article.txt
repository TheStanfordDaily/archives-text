# Broncos look to keep Card down
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Students generally like to see their
weekends last as long as possible.
But this past weekend probably couldn't
have ended soon enough for the Stanford
baseball team. By the time yesterday
rolled around, the Cardinal had dropped
three straight games to the USC Trojans,
fallen out of first place in the Pacific 10
Southern Division and plummeted from
7th to 14th in Baseball Americas national
rankings.
Stanford will try to reverse its fortunes
this afternoon, as the team travels to Santa
Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium for a 2:30 p.m.
non-conference matchup with the
Broncos.
The game is a valuable opportunity to
regain some momentum before this
weekend's crucial homestand against
Arizona. The Wildcats are currently tied
with the Cardinal for second in the Six-
Pac. Today's game is also a chance for
Stanford to settle a score with the Broncos:
the two teams have met four times already
this season, with each side nabbing two
victories.
In addition, as the Six-Pac race gets
tighter and tighter, non-conference games
take on greater significance in determining
post-season placement.
So Stanford will go south hungry for a
win. If the team is to satisfy that hunger, it
will have to get better pitching than it did
over the weekend.
"We didn't pitch real well down there,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said of the
USC series. "That (pitching) has been a
strong point for us most of the season."
Indeed, even after the weekend's

travails, the Cardinal pitching staff has a
sterling collective ERA of 3.80 for the
season (compared to 5.26 for opposing
pitchers). Leading the way is sophomore
Jack McDowell, with a 9-3 season record,
2.54 ERA and 108 strikeouts. The latter
figure leaves McDowell only 36 whiffs
short of the all-time Stanford single-season
record of 144, set by Steve Dunning in
1970.
One bright spot emerging out of the
USC weekend was the pitching perfor
mance of freshman Steve Chitren, who
threw four innings of no-hit ball in relief. It
was Chitren's second stellar effort in as
many appearances, and it came on the
heels of last week's seven-inning, two-hit
stint at Fresno State.
The Cardinal will probably send several
pitchers to the mound in this afternoon's
game, accoring to Marquess. Top candi
dates for action are junior right-hander
Rob Wassenaar, sophomore lefty A 1
Osuna and freshman righty Brian Keyser.
Stanford will look to continue the offen
sive production which brought it 15 runs in
the series with the Trojans.
"With the exception of the Saturday
game, we hit the ball as well as we have all
year," Marquess said.
Catcher John Ramos continues to pace
the Cardinal batting attack with a .337
season average, four home runs and 34
RBIs.
Santa Clara brings a 22-26 season mark
to this afternoon's game. The Broncos are
8-9 in the West Coast Athletic Conference
and will likely pitch junior right-hander
Matt McCormick (3-3, 6.00 ERA). Santa
Clara's big bats are carried by centerfielder
Todd Gates, with a .331 average, and first
baseman Gary Maasberg (.359).
