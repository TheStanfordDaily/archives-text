# Big win for sailors

If winning is habit forming, the Stanford
sailing team may have picked up a new
habit, one that is hopefully hard to break.
Coming off a convincing win last
weekend to capture the Northern Califor
nia Intercolligiate Championships, the
Cardinal pulled off yet another coup this
weekend in Santa Cruz. It was the
women's turn to sail to victory, upsetting
some of the top-ranked women's teams in
the country and winning the Pacific Coast
District Championships. The Cardinal also
garnered a berth in the women's nationals
to be held at the end of May at Brown Uni
versity.
The other teams never saw Stanford
coming. "We just ambushed these guys,"
Stanford Coach Joe Petrucci said. "I know
how they start and how they think. I've
been watching them for four years."
The teams which fell at the hands of the
previously 15th-ranked Cardinal squad in
cluded sixth-ranked San Diego State and
seventh-ranked UC-Irvine. "They were a
little overconfident. They came in very
cocky, fully expecting to win. Petrucci
said of Stanford's opponents.

They were in for a surprise. The Stan
ford women, having trained on the course
to become better acquainted with the high
winds and waves at Santa Cruz, won the
first race and never looked back. They
went on to win both "A" and "B" divi
sions. "We did very specialized training se
quences to upset the teams behind us,"
Petrucci said. "We were in control the
whole time ... in control of the wind, the
waves and, most importantly, the competi
tion."
The Cardinal's skippers, who had never
captained Stanford boats this season in
West Coast competition, surprised the
other teams also. Skippering in the " A" di
vision was Rona Sisson with Alvina
O'Brien and Gretchen Eliot crewing; the
"B" division was under the control of
Mary Boyce with Kristin Boyles, Buffy
Wendt and O'Brien.
Petrucci used various combinations of
boats, and the strategy paid off
handsomely for Stanford. Every sailor
taken was used. "We went with the right
amount of people," Petrucci said.
Their victory not only allows the team to
compete in the nationals but should make
it a force to be reckoned with. Two of th<*
teams the women beat have won nationals
in their divisions in previous years.
