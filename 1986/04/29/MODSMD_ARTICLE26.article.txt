# Hamada lands top recruit
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
News from the world of Stanford men's
gymnastics, since the culmination of its
season four weeks ago with a third -lace finish
at the NCAA Championships, has been both
good and bad.
Let's get the bad news out of the way first.
Last week, the NCAA all-around champion,
Jon Louis, broke his left hand while practic
ing a parallel bar mount. The injury will
sideline the Olympic hopeful for at least six
weeks. Louis' hand will be in a cast for four
to five weeks and then will require two weeks
of rehabilitation before it is ready for action.
The injury means Louis will miss Japan's
International Sports Fair this coming

weekend. He qualified for the event by win
ning the Pacific 10 Conference all-around
championship this season. According to
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada, who will
coach the United States team at the Sports
Fair, the competition will be fierce, with
squads from the Soviet Union, China and
Japan entered along with the Americans.
While those gymnasts participating will not
be the absolute best each country has to of
fer, Hamada said they will be the second best
possible teams each nation could put to
gether. Among the U.S. competitors will be
1985 NCAA champ Wes Suter of Nebraska,
and UCLA standout Robby Campbell.
The good news is that Hamada, the NCAA
West Region Coach of the Year, has success
fully recruited some of the top high school

gymnasts for next year's edition of Stanford
gymnastics, including the nation's No. 1
schoolboy, Adam Forman.
Forman, a native of Dallas, Tex., has been
training with one of the top clubs in the
country in Tucson, Ariz. He was the 1985
U.S. Gymnastics Federation Class I Junior
National Champion. Up to his signing, the
question was not whether or not Forman
would choose another school over Stanford,
but, rather, whether or not Forman would
choose his club over Stanford. According to
Hamada. Forman was thinking that he might
stick with his club until the 1988 Olympics.
Forman was not confident that a college
team could offer him the international pro
gram he wanted.
Hamada and the Cardinal philosophy
changed Forman's mind. "I had him visit
Stanford last weekend," Hamada said, "and
he really liked what he saw with our pro
gram."
Hamada also got his "No. 2" man, Conrad
Voorsanger of San Rafael, Nev., who signed
two weeks ago. Voorsanger has "the best
basics" Hamada said he has ever seen in a
high school gymnast.
"Not even Jon (Louis) or Randy (Besosa)
had as good basics as Conrad," Hamada said.
Among others on the list, Stanford will
also be the home of Hamada's "No. 3"
recruit. He is Charles Loop, and he will be a
member of the team next year through the
generosity of his future teammates. Accord
ing to Hamada, Loop needed an $8,000
scholarship if he was to attend Stanford.
Hamada, though, who had $32,000 of schol
arship money to give out this year, only had
$5,600 left for Loop.
So Hamada went to five of his gymnasts
and asked that they each give up $500 of
their scholarships for next year. They did and
so Loop will be attending Stanford.
Other men's gymnastics news includes Be
sosa's trip to Czechoslovakia in two weeks
for the Cup of Liberation competition. Be
sosa finished a disappointing 14th in the indi
vidual NCAA championships, with just a
couple of bad misses in the floor exercise
costing him a placing in the top five.
The U.S. National Team member's 57.65
all-around score in a late season meet versus
Arizona State was Stanford's top score of the
season. Throughout its 16-2 regular season,
the Cardinal was led by Besosa.
While Besosa is in Europe, the Western
Regional qualifying meet for the USA
Championships will take place at UCLA.
From the four regional meets, the top 72
gymnasts will advance to the national cham
pionships, the meet which determines the
U.S. National Team, and, possibly, the
Olympic team.
It is up to Hamada to decide who will com
pete in the Western Regional from Stanford.
He can enter the whole team, but said that if
he does not think a gymnast has been
working hard, he will not enter him. Last
year, besides Louis and Besosa, both of
whom went on to make the U.S. team, soph
omores Mike Matzek and Chuck Gerardo
also made the national championships.
Hamada said L.ouis will be ready for the
national championships in June, though he
will not be at full strength. Hamada also said
that Louis' injury is a simple fracture and has
nothing to do with any ligaments or nerve;

onship, Jon Louis recently broke his left hand while practicing. He is expected to be
out of action for at least six weeks.
therefore, his recovery will be full.
Preferring that his star pupil not
compete in the high pressure meet
unnecessarily, Hamada will petition
the U.S. Gymnastics Committee to
allow Louis to skip the champion
ships, yet maintain his membership
on the U.S. National Team as an un
ranked member. Louis would then be
able to continue to participate on the
international level.
Presently, Louis is ranked, accord
ing to Hamada, about 14th on the na
tional team, with Besosa right behind
him. The top ranked collegiate gym
nasts on the national team are a pair
of Bruins, sophomore Brian Ginsberg
and Campbell, a junior, at No. 8 and
No. 9, respectively.

Hamada, though, who had $32,000 of schol
arship money to give out this year, only had
$5,600 left for Loop.
So Hamada went to five of his gymnasts
and asked that they each give up $500 of
their scholarships for next year. They did and
so Loop will be attending Stanford.

costing him a placing in the top five.
The U.S. National Team member's 57.65
all-around score in a late season meet versus
Arizona State was Stanford's top score of the
season. Throughout its 16-2 regular season,
the Cardinal was led by Besosa.
While Besosa is in Europe, the Western
Regional qualifying meet for the USA
Championships will take place at UCLA.
From the four regional meets, the top 72
gymnasts will advance to the national cham
pionships, the meet which determines the
U.S. National Team, and, possibly, the
Olympic team.
It is up to Hamada to decide who will com
pete in the Western Regional from Stanford.
He can enter the whole team, but said that if
he does not think a gymnast has been
working hard, he will not enter him. Last
year, besides Louis and Besosa, both of
whom went on to make the U.S. team, soph
omores Mike Matzek and Chuck Gerardo
also made the national championships.
Hamada said L.ouis will be ready for the
national championships in June, though he
will not be at full strength. Hamada also said
that Louis' injury is a simple fracture and has
nothing to do with any ligaments or nerve;

therefore, his recovery will be full.
Preferring that his star pupil not
compete in the high pressure meet
unnecessarily, Hamada will petition
the U.S. Gymnastics Committee to
allow Louis to skip the champion
ships, yet maintain his membership
on the U.S. National Team as an un
ranked member. Louis would then be
able to continue to participate on the
international level.
Presently, Louis is ranked, accord
ing to Hamada, about 14th on the na
tional team, with Besosa right behind
him. The top ranked collegiate gym

No. 9, respectively.
News from the world of Stanford men's
gymnastics, since the culmination of its
season four weeks ago with a third -lace finish
at the NCAA Championships, has been both
good and bad.
Let's get the bad news out of the way first.
Last week, the NCAA all-around champion,
Jon Louis, broke his left hand while practic
ing a parallel bar mount. The injury will
sideline the Olympic hopeful for at least six
weeks. Louis' hand will be in a cast for four
to five weeks and then will require two weeks
of rehabilitation before it is ready for action.
The injury means Louis will miss Japan's
International Sports Fair this coming

weekend. He qualified for the event by win
ning the Pacific 10 Conference all-around
championship this season. According to
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada, who will
coach the United States team at the Sports
Fair, the competition will be fierce, with
squads from the Soviet Union, China and
Japan entered along with the Americans.
While those gymnasts participating will not
be the absolute best each country has to of
fer, Hamada said they will be the second best
possible teams each nation could put to
gether. Among the U.S. competitors will be
1985 NCAA champ Wes Suter of Nebraska,
and UCLA standout Robby Campbell.
The good news is that Hamada, the NCAA
West Region Coach of the Year, has success
fully recruited some of the top high school

gymnasts for next year's edition of Stanford
gymnastics, including the nation's No. 1
schoolboy, Adam Forman.
Forman, a native of Dallas, Tex., has been
training with one of the top clubs in the
country in Tucson, Ariz. He was the 1985
U.S. Gymnastics Federation Class I Junior
National Champion. Up to his signing, the
question was not whether or not Forman
would choose another school over Stanford,
but, rather, whether or not Forman would
choose his club over Stanford. According to
Hamada. Forman was thinking that he might
stick with his club until the 1988 Olympics.
Forman was not confident that a college
team could offer him the international pro
gram he wanted.
Hamada and the Cardinal philosophy
changed Forman's mind. "I had him visit
Stanford last weekend," Hamada said, "and
he really liked what he saw with our pro
gram."
Hamada also got his "No. 2" man, Conrad
Voorsanger of San Rafael, Nev., who signed
two weeks ago. Voorsanger has "the best
basics" Hamada said he has ever seen in a
high school gymnast.
"Not even Jon (Louis) or Randy (Besosa)
had as good basics as Conrad," Hamada said.
Among others on the list, Stanford will
also be the home of Hamada's "No. 3"
recruit. He is Charles Loop, and he will be a
member of the team next year through the
generosity of his future teammates. Accord
ing to Hamada, Loop needed an $8,000
scholarship if he was to attend Stanford.
Hamada, though, who had $32,000 of schol
arship money to give out this year, only had
$5,600 left for Loop.
