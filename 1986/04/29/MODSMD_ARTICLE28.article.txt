# Jackson rips Twins management

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â€” California Angels
slugger Reggie Jackson has taken a swing at the
Minnesota Twins, saying the American League
baseball club does not have enough black players.
"It's a shame, an absolute shame," Jackson, who
is black, told reporters during batting practice
before Sunday's Twins-Angels game at the Hubert
H. Humphrey Metrodome. "You got players (on
the Twins) who can't even play and there are
colored boys who need work."
The Twins have one American-born black player
on their 24-man roster, Kirby Puckett, who leads
the team in hitting and home runs. The only other
black on the team is Alex Sanchez of the
Dominican Republic.
The Twins have one of the fewest number of
blacks and other minority players of any team in
the major leagues.
"I can understand what Reggie says," said Andy
MacPhail, Twins vice president of player person

nel. "All he sees is what's on the field now. But it
would be crazy for us to eliminate a portion of bal
lplayers because of race. Hell, we want to win."
Jackson was quoted in Monday's editions of the
Minneapolis Star and Tribune and St. Paul Pioneer
Press and Dispatch.
"The real story is why aren't there colored boys
on this team (the Twins)," Jackson said.
"Why don't you write it?" Jackson asked the
reporters. "I shouldn't have to say it. You should
write it. But you make me say it and sound like a
pop-off and a racist."
Said MacPhail: "Reggie's objection is going to
take care of itself within a couple of years, and I
think it's already taking effect when you look
throughout our farm system."
MacPhail said the Twins roster may be
dominated by white players because the team has
always emphasized slugging power instead of
defense and base-running speed.

That emphasis should result in more minority
players on the club, he said.
Jackson said the lack of minorities in the Twins
organization is an embarrassment to Minnesota.
"There aren't prejudiced people here," Jackson
said. "It's a beautiful place. There are more inter
racial marriages here than anyplace in the
country."
Jackson's criticism is not new. Possible racism in
the Twias organization has been an issue at least
since October 1978 after former Twins owner Cal
vin Griffith spoke to the Waseca Lions Club.
In that speech, Griffith was quoted by the Min
neapolis Tribune as saying, "I'll tell you why we
(Twins) came to Minnesota; it was when I found
out you had 15,000 blacks here. Blacks don't go to
ball games. We came here because you've got
good, hard-working white people here."
Griffith claimed the quote was taken out of con
text.
