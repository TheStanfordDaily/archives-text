## 
### ALICE PETERS Staff writer 
While most of the campus slept in Sunday
morning, adjusting to the time change, 100
athletes set their alarm clocks and headed for
Angell Field, eager to meet the Stanford
Challenge.
Now in its fifth year, the Stanford Chal
lenge is a race that includes an 880-yard run,

Feature

a bike race, a quarter-mile swim in Lake
Lagunita, a four-mile run, an innertube race,
a bike race back to Angell Field and an
agility course.
Behind the scenes, the Stanford Challenge
was organized and officiated by students in
Trancos and Rinconada. The nice was part
of the Health Enhancement Program in the
two all-freshmen dorms, organized by Jack
Martin, a doctoral candidate in the School of
Education.
"It's part of my doctoral study on the
health of freshmen at Stanford," Martin ex
plained. "It's basically a program for fresh
man students to help them develop good
habits during their freshman year, and to
identify problems that come up."

Martin has been assisted with the program
by Anita Jackson, a graduate student in biol
ogy. "I have a strong interest in the degrada
tion of health, especially during the adoles
cent years," she said.
Martin and Jackson have concentrated on
providing participants in the study with
healthcare information. "During the winter
quarter, we tried to interact with students in
Trancos and Rinconada by having weekly
health fairs," Jackson said. Topics included
weight control, stress management and drug
and alcohol abuse. "We've done a lot of re
search and tried to present the most recent
information," Jackson added.
Students participating in the program had
mixed opinions on its effectiveness. "It is a
good idea," explained Sarah Swartz, a
Trancos resident, "but it's hard to say
whether it really helped me with my health
habits."
Martin hoped that the Stanford Challenge
would help convey his feeling that exercise
can be fun. "The race is just a fun event for
the Stanford community, designed to create
more of an awareness of exercise for
everybody," he explained.
After Martin completes his doctoral thesis

in the fall, he plans to move on.
He hopes that a fraternity,
dorm or club will choose to
continue the Stanford Chal
lenge tradition.
"It was pretty much of a
sprint," said Albert Boyce, who
won the men's individual title
with a time of 50:04.
"It was really well organ
ized," Boyce added. "It's
pretty hard to organize an
event like this and have it come
off."
In the women's individual
competition, Eli Holmes
cruised to victory in a time of
60 minutes, followed closely by
Janice Bishop.
In addition to the categories
for individuals, there were also
team participants in the Stan
ford Challenge.
In the six-person all-male
competition, "Parade of Hor
ribles," a team made up of
first-year law students, set a
course record with a time of
43:56, beating last year's win
ning time of 44:20.
"Our age was a factor here,"
explained Brian Casey, who
covered the swimming leg.
"We wanted to show that law
students are not these study
geeks."
A team of freshmen from
Otero won the women's six
person category. Their time of
53:42 was the ninth fastest
clocking this year for a six
person team.
"I thought it was great — it
was really fun," said Lisa
Meckfessel, who specialized in
the biking events.
In coed competition, "Screw
U" captured first place, and
their time was the third best in
overall six-person competition.
In the two-person coed divi
sion, Hillary Ellen and Collin
Boyle completed the race in
50:10.
The Stanford Challenge was
sponsored by Budweiser Light,
allowing the participants to en
ter free of charge.
