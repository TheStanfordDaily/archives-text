Throw out the records, because when Stan
ford Coach Cathy Lincoln takes her 4-27 squad
to Santa Clara today to take on the 18-8
Broncos, neither she nor her leading hitter is
ready to assume the role of underdog.
"I think we have a pretty good chance against
them," Lincoln said. "We're confident. The at
titude is good. I think it will be an even match."
"If we play the way we have been, we should
win," said Stanford third baseman Kathy
Dominguez, who currently tops the squad with
a .247 batting average.
With Dominguez the only regular hitting over
.200, Lincoln admitted that her team "is a little
frustrated with their hitting."
"We're getting beat consistently 1-0,"
Dominguez said. "We seem to play one step be
hind our competition.
A recent 1-0, 1-0 doubleheader loss to peren
nial power UCLA pointed out both the
shortcomings in the Cardinal offense and the
strength of its defense and pitching.
"We played very well against UCLA," Lin
coln said. "Our defense against UCLA was su
perb. We're just not getting the key hits."
Lisa Buchanan, who is slated to start the first

game, and Betsy Watson, who will take the
mound in the second, will attempt to hold the
Bronco offense in check.
Buchanan and Watson comprise the entire
Stanford pitching staff, and a steady diet of
doubleheaders has placed a lot of wear and tear
on their arms.
"Betsy is a little sore," Lincoln said yester
day. "She didn't throw much today. I think
she'll be alright."
The Cardinal hurlers will face a Bronco.squad
which has fattened its record on Bay Area and
West Coast Athletic Conference competition,
which is typically not up to the level of oppo
nents Stanford plays.
"Santa Clara has not been that strong in the
past," Lincoln said. "I'm not sure they've
played particularly tough teams to date. The
skill level in their league seems really varied.
We have a chance to win both games."
"We play a schedule that is definitely above
our heads," Dominguez said. "1 don't think our
record is a reflection of our ability to compete
with teams around here."
For Lincoln there will be added incentive
when her squad takes on Santa Clara this year.
"I would really like to beat Santa Clara," she
said. "They got one of the recruits we went
after."
