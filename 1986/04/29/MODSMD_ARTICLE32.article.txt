Soviet calls Radio Liberty CIA front
MOSCOW — Alex Tumanov, who mysteriously disappeared two
months ago from his job at American-run Radio Liberty in Munich,
surfaced in Moscow yesterday to accuse the broadcast operation of anti-
Soviet espionage.
Tumanov, 41, nervously read a prepared statement charging that his
station and Radio Free Europe are a front for CIA covert operations
aimed at the Soviet Union and other East Bloc states.
But he refused to say how or when he returned to Moscow or why he
decided to go back home despite his 21 years in the West and his yearly
salary of 150,000 West German marks (about $71,000).
Tumanov said that he was not kidnapped, however, and that he
returned after getting in touch with a Soviet embassy in a country that he
would not identify.
"I am not going to go into detail," he said, sighing deeply. "This is my
personal business. If certain questioas were settled, they were settled
elsewhere — that's all I can say."
Tumanov's return to the Soviet Union was startling because of how he
originally came to the West — by deserting his Soviet navy ship in 1965,
an action punishable by death in the Soviet Union.
Asked about possible prosecution in his homeland, Tumanov gave an
other deep sigh and said: "I am here. I am a Soviet citizen, de facto."
Yesterday's briefing took an unusual turn when several British and
American correspondents complained that Tumanov was "smearing"
some of their colleagues by insinuating that they were spies because they
visited the station's Munich offices or received its research materials.
Envoy tries to ease French concern
PARIS — U.S. Ambassador Joe Rodgers tried to soothe French
worries over a mounting anti-French mood in the United States with a
statement yesterday proclaiming that "the bonds of common values
which unite us with France are too important to be put into question" by
the French refusal to cooperate with the American bombing of Libya.
The statement came amid growing concern and puzzlement here over
both the anti-French feelings in the United States and the huge number
of cancellatioas by American tourists of planned visits to France. Fear of
terrorist attacks have combined with the anti-French resentment to per
suade Americans to stay away. A spokesman for the Ministry of Tourism
said that the French government had given up trying to attract American
tourists for this summer.
Organizers of the Cannes Film Festival were upset by reports that a
number of American film celebrities, such as directors Martin Scorsese
and Steven Spielberg and actors Burt Reynolds, Walter Matthau and
Whoopi Goldberg, had cancelled plaas to attend the May event out of
concern for their security. Paris newspapers have prominently featured
accounts of anti-French demonstrations in the United States, including
photos of a Georgia bonfire destroying French goods and a smiling
woman holding up a sign saying, "Burn the Arrogant Little Toads."
In his statement. Ambassador Rodgers said that the United States was
disappointed by the French refusal to let the U.S. warplanes fly over
France on April 14 en route to Libya.
But. Rodgers said, "I will be going to the United States in a few days
for my daughter's university graduation, and I plan to remind every
American I meet, whether public official or private citizen, that the
bonds of common values which unite us with France are too important to
be put into question by this incident.
"The stakes are simply too high," he went on, "for us to allow the ad
versaries of democracy to use this issue to drive a deep wedge between
us."
Bomb mars Hirohito celebration
TOKYO — A bomb went off early today in a downtown Tokyo park
where a radical group was to demonstrate later in the day in opposition
to celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of Emperor Hirohito's as
cent to the throne.
One man was seriously injured in the explosion, which took place in a
public toilet in the park. A police spokesman said the man may have
been trying to set the device when it blew up.
The police spokesman said it was not clear whether the man was con
nected to the small, ultraleftist Revolutionary Workers' Council, one of
many groups that have vowed to "blast" both the emperor's 60th an
niversary celebrations and the seven-nation economic summit meeting
beginning Sunday, which President Reagan will attend.
The Revolutionary Workers' Council had notified police that it in
tended to stage an anti-Hirohito rally at the park.
l here are between 200 to 300 ultraleftist groups in Japan, many of
whose 35,000 members subscribe to theories of violent worldwide revo
lution. The groups call Hirohito a war criminal and have denounced the
government-sponsored ceremony to celebrate the beginning of his reign
as an attempt to turn back the clock to the pre-World War II period
when the emperor was considered a god.
Three Libyan suspects leave Turkey
ANKARA, Turkey and BRUSSELS, Belgium — Two Libyan
diplomats and a Libyan Airlines official named in connection with an
abortive attempt to bomb a U.S. military officers' club earlier this month
have left Turkey, the semi-official Anatolian News Agency said yester
day.
The agency report amounted to confirmation by the Turkish govern
ment of a report by the Huerriyet Newspaper that police have issued ar
rest warrants for two diplomats at the Libyan Embassy and for an official
of Libyan Airlines.
Huerriyet said that all three — diplomats Shaban Muhammad Hassan
and Abdelhamid Al-Hadi, and Mansur Umran, a Libyan Airlines repre
sentative in Istanbul, Turkey, left the country after the abortive attack
on the U.S. officers club in Ankara.
The newspaper quoted Ali Al-Ecefli Ramadan and Rejab Rohoma Tar
houni. two Libyans who were arrested after the bombing attempt, as
saying that the three officials assisted them and supplied the explosives
for the April 18 attack.
In a related story, the Belgian government expelled seven members of
Libya's 14-person diplomatic mission yesterday, the Foreign Ministry
announced.
A spokesman said that the Libyan Embassy was also told to reduce by
half its four-person administrative staff, raising to nine the number of
Libyan mission dependents under expulsion orders.
U.S. sends carrier to Mediterranean
WASHINGTON — The Navy is sending the giant nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier Enterprise through the Suez Canal, deploying three carri
ers in the central Mediterranean Sea north of Libya, Reagan Adminis
tration sources said yesterday.
The ship, the largest carrier in the Navy, was expected to complete the
approximately 20-hour trip through the canal by this morning, and then
turn west to join the Coral Sea and the America, two carriers that saw
action off Libya two weeks ago during the bombing raids of Tripoli and
other targets in that country.
The Enterprise will eventually replace the Coral Sea, the deployment
of which had been extended indefinitely before the April 14 raids. But
all three carriers, accompanied by battle groups of frigates, cruisers and
destroyers, are expected to remain in the area for at least two weeks.
One military source, speaking on the condition that he not be identi
fied. said the three warships would probably operate in the central
Mediterranean until President Reagan returns to the United States from
the 13-day Asian trip he has just begun, during which he will attend the
economic summit in Tokyo.
