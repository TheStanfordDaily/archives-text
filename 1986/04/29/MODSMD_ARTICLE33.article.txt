# Soviets confirm nuclear accident
## Radiation from Ukrainian plant reaches European countries 
### 
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union said last night
that an accident at a major nuclear power plant in
the Ukraine had damaged a reactor and caused un
specified casualties. The unexplained accident also
sent a radioactive cloud hundreds of miles into
Western Europe.
The announcement, unusual for the Soviet Un
ion, which rarely publicizes disasters, came several
hours after four Scandinavian countries reported
detecting abnormally high levels of radioactivity in
their atmosphere and Sweden's ambassador to
Moscow began questioning Soviet officials.
The Soviet statement did not say whether there
were deaths in the accident, which the news agency
TASS said was at the Chernobyl power plant, 60
miles north of Kiev. It said only that "measures are
being undertaken to eliminate the consequences of
the accident. Aid is being given to those affected."

The TASS statement, read on the television even
ing news, said one of the plant's atomic reactors
was damaged and "a government commission has
been set up" to investigate it — seen by Western
diplomats as an indication of high-level concern.
Some western diplomats here speculated that be
cause of the proximity to Kiev, a city of 2.3 million
people, and the unusual public announcement,
there may have been a high death toll.
Officials in Sweden, where radioactivity was de
tected in the air, soil and tree leaves, said that the
amount reaching that country was well above nor
mal but presented no immediate threat to people.
Denmark, Finland and Norway also reported un
usual radioactivity, with high readings coming from
islands in the Baltic Sea.
Sweden said last night that it is seeking "detailed
information" from Soviet authorities about the

accident, so that it can take precautionary measures
if the contamination can be expected to continue or
increase. Swedish Energy Minister Birgitta Dahl
complained that it was "unacceptable" that
Swedish authorities and others outside the Soviet
Union had been given no notification, and she said
Sweden would demand that the entire Soviet civil
ian nuclear program be made subject to interna
tional inspections.
The Soviets also did not say when the accident
happened, but Scandinavian experts said that their
trackings and wind patterns indicated that it had
happened early in the weekend.
A later TASS story called the accident "the first
one in the Soviet Union" — a description disputed
by U.S. and other Western authorities — and listed
what it said were similar nuclear plant accidents in
other countries, including the United States.
