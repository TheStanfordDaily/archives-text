# Deaver requests independent counsel
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Lobbyist Mi
chael Deaver yesterday asked Attor
ney General Edwin Meese 111 to seek
appointment of an independent coun
sel to investigate allegations that he
has violated conflict-of-interest laws
in the 11 months since he resigned as
President Reagan's deputy chief of
staff.
Meese, however, removed himself
from the politically charged issue,
citing his 20-year association with
Deaver in Washington and
Sacramento. The decision on whether
to ask a special federal court for ap
pointment of an outside prosecutor
will be made by Deputy Attorney
General Lowell Jensen, a Justice De
partment spokesman said.
Deaver, in a statement released
with his lawyer's request for an inde
pendent counsel, said that he believes
thit "pigmentary due process and

fairness to me and my family require
appointment of an independent coun
sel."
"While I'm grateful for the presi
dent's continuing support, the climate
has become such that this is the only
way to resolve the issue fairly,"
Deaver said. When asked Friday
about the request for appointment of
an independent counsel by five Dem
ocratic members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, Reagan dis
missed the controversy over his
longtime aide as "ridiculous."
Leaving Honolulu yesterday on his
way to the Tokyo economic summit,
Reagan said of Deaver's request: "If
he wants to do that, it's up to him. I
don't think there's any need for it be
cause he hasn't done anything
wrong."
Deaver's request for an indepen

dent counsel carries no legal weight, a
Justice Department spokesman ac
knowledged, because Jensen is likely
to make the decision on the basis of a
preliminary inquiry by FBI agents
and the department's public integrity
section, which is expected to begin
shortly.
But Deaver's tactic of calling for an
investigation himself parallels that
used by Meese and former Labor
Secretary Raymond Donovan when
pressure was building for an indepen
dent counsel to investigate their fi
nancial dealings. Independent coun
sels were subsequently appointed and
cleared both both men of criminal
wrongdoing, though Donovan is still
awaiting trial on related charges in
New York.
Meese, whose request in 1984 for
an independent counsel was ex
pressed in words similar to those used

by Deaver, brushed aside a question
at a press conference on whether he
or any member of his staff had dis
cussed the allegations against Deaver
with the powerful lobbyist or anyone
representing him about the matters
under investigation.
The likelihood of an independent
counsel being sought grew signifi
cantly Friday when the federal Office
of Government Ethics submitted its
review of the conflict-of-interest alle
gations to the Justice Department for
a full-scale criminal investigation.
David Martin, director of the ethics
office, said the material he sent the
Justice Department dealt principally
with Deaver's lobbying on behalf of
Canada, particularly on the issue of
acid rain, pollution supposedly
caused by heavy industry in the
United States.
