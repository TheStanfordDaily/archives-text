Nixon claim upheld
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department
has told President Reagan that he must support
Richard Nixon's claim of executive privilege in
the former president's attempt to block the Na
tional Archives from releasing more than 2 mil
lion pages of his presidential papers this summer.
In what would be a significant expansion of the
doctrine of executive privilege, the department's
unpublished legal opinion says that an incumbent
president is always bound to support such claims
by a former president, except in rare cases where
it would conflict with the incumbent's constitu
tional duties.
Congressional critics say the department
opinion would enable Reagan and future chief
executives to keep their own presidential papers
under seal years after they have left office. The
opinion says that the director of the National Ar
chives, which Congress made an independent
agency last year, has no choice but to comply
with an executive privilege claim by an incum
bent president.
The House Government Operations subcom
mittee on government information, which plans
hearings on the issue today, provided a copy of
the opinion. Subcommittee Chairman Glenn En

glish (D-Okla.) called it "highly suspicious" and
said the Reagan Administration is seeking "to es
tablish a precedent here that would protect not
only President Nixon but would also protect
President Reagan in the future."
Libya raid questioned
WASHINGTON — Despite the widespread
popularity in the United States of the recent
counterterrorist air attack on Libya, three former
national security advisers who served under
Presidents Reagan, Carter and Ford are express
ing serious reservations about the raid's long
term effects on both terrorism and Reagan's
public support.
In separate interviews, the three said that the
April 14 bombing of Tripoli and other Libyan
targets already has demonstrated that it cannot
halt terrorism. And they predicted that, if it is
repeated, the public support that Reagan now
enjoys will fade away.
"There are things other than air attack, which
are sensible and easier to sustain publicly, such as
mining or a blockade," said Robert McFarlane,
who resigned as Reagan's national security advi
ser last December. "Americans have a short

lived tolerance for violence," he said, and would
soon be repulsed by the civilian casualties associ
ated with additional air attacks.
McFarlane's concerns about Reagan's ability
to maintain domestic support for further militaiy
action in the face of mounting terrorist incidents
is shared by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President
Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, and
Brent Scowcroft, who served in that capacity un
der President Gerald Ford.
All three said that they favor a broader ap
proach to terrorism, one that is not so exclusively
focused on the military option.
Market finishes mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market turned in a
mixed performance in dull trading yesterday as
some late blue-chip buying boosted the Dow
Jones industrial average.
Various market measures made minor move
ments during the session. After spending most of
the day near Friday's closing level, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials staged a late ad
vance and finished with a gain of 8.18 at
1,843.75.
