Walker speaks in trial
SAN FRANCISCO — Confessed spymaster
John Walker, testifying for the prosecution in the
Jerry Whitworth spy trial, said yesterday that de
pression over marital problems led him into
espionage for the Soviet Union.
"The marital problems caused a lot of depres
sion in my own life. . . . It was ultimately respon
sible, I believe, for me getting into espionage,"
the balding, bespectacled Walker told a federal
court jury in a packed courtroom.
"I was depressed, and I committed a desperate
act. I contacted the Soviet Union, and I agreed to
sell secrets to them."
Walker said he made the decision on impulse
and is still not sure why.
"I erroneously felt that the problem could be
solved financially," he said.
"So you did it to get money?" asked Assistant
U.S. Attorney William Farmer.
"Yes," said Walker.
He said he made the decision in early 1968.
after 13 years as a communications specialist in
the Navy. The prosecution says it was six years
later that Walker recruited Whitworth. his friend
and fellow Navy instructor, to be his chief sup
plier of classified information.
Whitworth, 46. of Davis, is charged with sel
ling information about secret code and communi
cations systems for $332,000 between 1974 and
1983, knowing that Walker would turn the ma
terial over to the Soviet Union.
Seven of the 13 charges against Whitworth
carry potential life sentences. He is also charged
with evading taxes on the $332,000.
Walker pleaded guilty to espionage in a Bal
timore federal court last October, admitted 17
years of espionage operations and agreed to tes
tify against Whitworth in exchange for a reduced
sentence for Walker's son. Michael, who also
pleaded guilty. Walker's brother, Arthur, was

convicted of spying by a federal judge in Norfolk,
Va.
This was the first confrontation between Whit
worth and Walker since they were arrested last
spring. Walker, wearing a gray suit and striped
tie, was led into the courtroom by a federal mar
shal and did not look at Whitworth before taking
the stand for what is scheduled to be a week of
testimony.
Court upholds bum ban
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
refused yesterday to hear a constitutional attack
by a group of the homeless on a controversial
Santa Barbara ordinance that bans sleeping over
night in public parks and beaches.
The court's order, issued without comment,
cleared the way for the immediate start of trials
of 29 persons charged with violating the or
dinance in the affluent coastal community.
The justices declined to review claims by attor
neys representing defendants in the case that the
measure, in denying the "basic human necessity"
of sleep, violated their constitutional right to
travel and to equal protection of the law.
The ordinance was adopted in 1979 in
response to what the City Council called an
"alarming increase" in often-violent criminal be
havior among transients. It bars sleeping in
public parks and beaches from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
and sleeping in parking lots, streets and other
public places at all times. A first offense carries a
fine of $ 100, a second $200 and a third $250.
An attorney for the homeless, Willard Has
tings Jr., of the Legal Defense Center, expressed
disappointment with the court's action but said
renewed appeals would be made if any of the
defendants were convicted.
"We believe these people were singled out for
prosecution because of who they were," Hastings

said. "This was a 'victimless crime,' if you can
even call it a crime at all."
City Attorney Steven Amerikaner said he was
"very pleased" with the court's order, adding
that the ordinance was no different from those of
many other communities.
The ban on overnight sleeping in public parks
and beaches was among the complaints regis
tered last month during a demonstration at City
Hall. Spokesmen for the homeless claimed that
the city was using the anti-sleeping law to try to
drive them out.
KGB beat Miller's lover
LOS ANGELES — A Soviet woman who
retracted her confession to spying told jurors in
Richard Miller's espionage trial yesterday that
she was beaten bloody by Soviet agents who
branded her "an American whore" during a trip
to Moscow.
Svetlana Ogorodnikov, testifying a fourth day
in the trial of her former FBI lover, also gazed at
a series of classified documents placed before her
on the witness stand and said she had never seen
them before.
These were the documents she allegedly
received from Miller, the only FBI agent ever
charged with espionage.
Earlier, she told of a June 1984 visit to Mos
cow at which she reported her affair with former
FBI agent John Hunt to the KGB and was
beaten. She said she didn't tell agents about Mil
ler.

of 29 persons charged with violating the or
dinance in the affluent coastal community.
The justices declined to review claims by attor
neys representing defendants in the case that the
measure, in denying the "basic human necessity"
of sleep, violated their constitutional right to
travel and to equal protection of the law.
The ordinance was adopted in 1979 in
response to what the City Council called an
"alarming increase" in often-violent criminal be
havior among transients. It bars sleeping in
public parks and beaches from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
and sleeping in parking lots, streets and other
public places at all times. A first offense carries a
fine of $ 100, a second $200 and a third $250.
An attorney for the homeless, Willard Has
tings Jr., of the Legal Defense Center, expressed
disappointment with the court's action but said
renewed appeals would be made if any of the
defendants were convicted.
"We believe these people were singled out for
prosecution because of who they were," Hastings

said. "This was a 'victimless crime,' if you can
even call it a crime at all."
City Attorney Steven Amerikaner said he was
"very pleased" with the court's order, adding
that the ordinance was no different from those of
many other communities.
The ban on overnight sleeping in public parks
and beaches was among the complaints regis
tered last month during a demonstration at City
Hall. Spokesmen for the homeless claimed that
the city was using the anti-sleeping law to try to
drive them out.
KGB beat Miller's lover
LOS ANGELES — A Soviet woman who
retracted her confession to spying told jurors in
Richard Miller's espionage trial yesterday that
she was beaten bloody by Soviet agents who
branded her "an American whore" during a trip
to Moscow.
Svetlana Ogorodnikov, testifying a fourth day
in the trial of her former FBI lover, also gazed at
a series of classified documents placed before her
on the witness stand and said she had never seen
them before.
These were the documents she allegedly
received from Miller, the only FBI agent ever
charged with espionage.
Earlier, she told of a June 1984 visit to Mos
cow at which she reported her affair with former
FBI agent John Hunt to the KGB and was
beaten. She said she didn't tell agents about Mil
ler.

Walker speaks in trial
SAN FRANCISCO — Confessed spymaster
John Walker, testifying for the prosecution in the
Jerry Whitworth spy trial, said yesterday that de
pression over marital problems led him into
espionage for the Soviet Union.
"The marital problems caused a lot of depres
sion in my own life. . . . It was ultimately respon
sible, I believe, for me getting into espionage,"
the balding, bespectacled Walker told a federal
court jury in a packed courtroom.
"I was depressed, and I committed a desperate
act. I contacted the Soviet Union, and I agreed to
sell secrets to them."
Walker said he made the decision on impulse
and is still not sure why.
"I erroneously felt that the problem could be
solved financially," he said.
"So you did it to get money?" asked Assistant
U.S. Attorney William Farmer.
"Yes," said Walker.
He said he made the decision in early 1968.
after 13 years as a communications specialist in
the Navy. The prosecution says it was six years
later that Walker recruited Whitworth. his friend
and fellow Navy instructor, to be his chief sup
plier of classified information.
Whitworth, 46. of Davis, is charged with sel
ling information about secret code and communi
cations systems for $332,000 between 1974 and
1983, knowing that Walker would turn the ma
terial over to the Soviet Union.
Seven of the 13 charges against Whitworth
carry potential life sentences. He is also charged
with evading taxes on the $332,000.
Walker pleaded guilty to espionage in a Bal
timore federal court last October, admitted 17
years of espionage operations and agreed to tes
tify against Whitworth in exchange for a reduced
sentence for Walker's son. Michael, who also
pleaded guilty. Walker's brother, Arthur, was

convicted of spying by a federal judge in Norfolk,
Va.
This was the first confrontation between Whit
worth and Walker since they were arrested last
spring. Walker, wearing a gray suit and striped
tie, was led into the courtroom by a federal mar
shal and did not look at Whitworth before taking
the stand for what is scheduled to be a week of
testimony.
