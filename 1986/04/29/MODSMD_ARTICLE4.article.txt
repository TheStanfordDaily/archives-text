# USW employees demand apology
## Workers petition over layoff 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Members of United Stanford
Workers (USW) employed in Stan
ford's interdepartmental ID mail sys
tem have circulated a petition de
manding back pay and a letter of
apology for Clancy Langston, a
worker whom they cla'im was
suspended as part of Stanford's
"overall plan to bust the union."
An informational flier attached to
copies of the petition claims that
Langston, "who had an attendance
problem because of an illness," was
laid off March 28 for three days after
arriving late for work.
"Clancy was made an example of
Stanford's move to clamp down on
our working conditions," the flier
states, suggesting that the action was
intended as "retribution" against ID
mail employees who joined the USW
in a 1982 campus strike.
Langston and co-workers respon
sible for the petition could not be
reached for comment last night, but
USW Chief Negotiator Mary Ann
Tenuto said yesterday that Langston
and his supporters were "very upset"
at the suspension.
Tenuto said that she did not know
what the workers intended to do with
any signatures collected.
The petition, signed by the "Justice
for Clancy Langston Committee,"
demands that the University return

three days of back pay to Langston,
send him a letter of apology and
"withdraw the disciplinary letter from
.. . Langston's file." The letter fur
ther calls upon the University to
"stop all harassment and layoffs at
Stanford."
"Despite the rapidly growing
volume of mail, staff cutbacks and
management attacks, the workers will
continue to provide the best service
to the Stanford cummunity and light
for justice for all workers," the flier
concludes.
University Chief Negotiator Pris
cilla Wheeler said last night she was
unaware of the actions taken by
Langston's co-workers but she
believed University job supervisors to
be "extremely lenient, especially in
cases of illness."
"(Supervisors) start out by saying
there's a problem. It typically gets to
suspension only if this first method is
not effective," Wheeler said, adding
that the ID mail deliveries have con
sistently been criticized for tardiness
"for some time."
"It's not a global attempt (by the
University) to do anything to the
workers," Wheeler said. She added
that Stanford has a grievance arbitra
tion procedure for handling such
complaints.
USW President Dennis Blake yes
terday declined to comment, saying
he had not been informed of the peti
tion circulation.
