### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
Three unidentified men entered
the Delta Kappa Epsilon house
Thursday night and, complaining that
recognition of the Delta Upsilon fra
ternity was unfairly revoked last
week, initiated a fight with student
Terry Jackson and a DKE member.
The men were uninvited and
"obviously drunk," according to
DKE Residential Assistant Alan
Zafran. "They started up the stairs
and five or six DKEs ran up the steps.
The three guys headed for the third
floor, where Terry stopped them."
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and director of the
Row, said she believes the University
will investigate the incident, adding,
"I'm very interested in knowing who
is responsible for the altercation."
According to Jackson, after learn
ing of his identity, one of the intrud
ers turned to him and said, "You're
the one who the DUs told me got
them thrown out of their house."
Jackson is a member of the Inter
fraternity Council's judicial review
board, which decided last week to
revoke the DU's recognition.
The three men directed racial slurs
at Jackson, who is black, and chal
lenged him to a fight in the house,
Zafran said.
After arguing, Jackson and the
three went outside the front of the
DKE house, accompanied by about
20 DKE members.
One of the three "took a wild
punch at Don Galles," a DKE mem
ber and president of the IFC, and
missed, Zafran said.
One of them hit Jackson on the
back of his head and later tried to
kick him twice, Jackson said. Another
then threw Jackson onto the ground
and wrestled with him, Zafran said.
Several DKE members broke up the
fight.
"My intention was to get them out
of the house," Jackson said. "My in
tention was not to fight."
During the incident, a DKE mem
ber who asked not to be identified ap
proached one of the three in a calm
manner to discourage any more fight

ing, he said.
"Before I knew it I was way out in
Kairos' lawn alone with him, and he
floored me. My nose was bleeding so
I immediately went back to the
house," said the DKE member.
The police, who had been called
earlier by members of DKE and
Kairos, arrived at that point and
pursued the three men, who fled
down Mayfield Avenue.
The police did not locate the three
suspects, according to Stanford Police
Capt. Marvin Moore, who added that
the three are also suspects in a vehicle
vandalism case that occurred on the
same night.
At 7:30 the next morning, accord
ing to Zafran, the DKE house
received an anonymous call from
someone claiming he was the person
who hit the DKE member.
"He claimed that he was a Stanford
student and that the two others are
not. He was very apologetic. He said
he hoped that (the DKE member)
would not talk to The Daily," Zafran
said.
There was some speculation why
the three men chose to attempt to
fight Jackson. "There is some
animosity towards me because of the
composition of the review board,"
Jackson said.
Of the six members, two are black
and from unhoused fraternities Jack
son is a member of Kappa Alpha Phi.
DU President Scott Hartman said
last week that unhoused fraternities
favored revoking DU recognition in
the hopes that that they would be
given the DU house.
"That is not the case," said Jack
son, who noted that Conklin said
there exists no possibility that an
other fraternity would be given the
DU's house.
"I have no conclusive proof that
the three are DUs. To say that they
are DUs would be wrong. But to say
that they might be friends of the DUs
is valid," Zafran said.
Zafran emphasized that "no DKE
threw a punch" and that the fight
took place between outsiders.
"The general house view is that the
whole thing is uncalled for," said Phil
Nakashima, a DKE member.

composition of the review board,"
Jackson said.
Of the six members, two are black
and from unhoused fraternities Jack
son is a member of Kappa Alpha Phi.
DU President Scott Hartman said
last week that unhoused fraternities
favored revoking DU recognition in
the hopes that that they would be
given the DU house.
"That is not the case," said Jack
son, who noted that Conklin said
there exists no possibility that an
other fraternity would be given the
DU's house.
"I have no conclusive proof that
the three are DUs. To say that they
are DUs would be wrong. But to say
that they might be friends of the DUs
is valid," Zafran said.
Zafran emphasized that "no DKE
threw a punch" and that the fight
took place between outsiders.
"The general house view is that the
whole thing is uncalled for," said Phil
Nakashima, a DKE member.
