Little green men with antennae protruding

intelligence level that far exceeds that of
.humans/ Inhabiting another planet in another
solar system or galaxy?
« The possibility of intelligent forms of life
.outside ot our solar system was the subject of a
speech at Branner Hall Friday by the manager
.ol the space science and application program at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
Describing intelligent life as "life that can
.build and use tools," Albert Hibbs told about
90 people that such forms of life on planets
beyond our solar system would require "some
very complicated chemistry."
Life calls for "a good solution and the right
chemistry, and that requires the right gravity
and the right atmosphere," Hibbs said, noting
that the temperature of a life-sustaining planet
must be roughly equivalent to that of the earth.
Attempts to find life using radio telescopes,
first begun in 1960, have been unsuccessful,
Hibbs said, although he added that searches still
continue.
. Hibbs presented three possible scenarios of
what life in another solar system might be like,
including the possibility that life elsewhere, if it
exists, would be biologically developed far
beyond that of humans.
"If evolution is continued, then there may

have evolved (life) quite a bit beyond ours," he
said, noting that this could be true for planets
older than the earth.
Forms of life that are biologically superior to
humans would have the capacity to destroy
humanity if they discovered earth, and such
creatures might also treat the lesser-developed
humans as people today on earth treat their
pets, Hibbs said.
Another scenario Hibbs detailed involves
forms of life developed to the same biological
level of humans. This could be true if beings
elsewhere, like humans, had discovered the ge
netic secrets of DNA, allowing them to prevent
further biological development and preserve
their own kind, he said.
A third scenario for life elsewhere involves
the "garbage theory of evolution" in which
humans are "the chauffeurs of life," Hibbs said.
In this case, humans will have developed the
capacity to send people to planets outside our
solar system.
The garbage left by visiting astronauts would
contain the anaerobic bacteria necessary for
life, he said. Eventually, the bacteria in the
garbage would advance to the stage where
human beings would develop, Hibbs said.
Asked if the government had secret evidence
that other forms of life had visited earth, Hibbs
said: "We don't know how to keep secrets like
that."
"I wish there were evidence I could believe."
he said.
