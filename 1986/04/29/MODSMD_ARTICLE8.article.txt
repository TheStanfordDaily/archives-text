# Speaker proposes plan for Haiti
## 
### JIM GUNTON Staff writer 
Herve Jean-Charles, a doctoral candi
date in education speaking on "Haiti
After the Duvaliers," yesterday proposed
several measures to help that troubled na
tion get back on its feet.
These measures included developing
medical, agricultural and educational pro
grams designed to reduce Haiti's depen
dence on foreign aid.
Jean-Charles told a Bechtel Interna
tional Center audience that the United
States alone contributes over $56 million
annually to the Haitians, but that the
money is not helping the Haitians. For ex
ample, Jean-Charles said, "over 75 per
cent of the Haitian people are illiterate."
This percentage, he said, is the highest in
the Western hemisphere.
"And unfortunately, this is not the
worst of it. Our infant mortality rate is
somewhere between 110 and 140 infants
in every thousand. This, too, is one of the
highest in the American hemisphere."
Jean-Charles said that it is a pity to go
through the streets of the nation's capital,
Port au Prince, because there was so much
negligence and disease. With 800,000
people, Port au Prince is the most
populous Haitian city, he said.
Jean-Charles added that racism is a
major concern for the Haitian president

and his people. Racism has a long history
in Haiti, where the African slave trade
flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries,
he said. "For the last 180 years there has
been no Haitian president who didn't have
to face this racial devil," Jean-Charles
said.
He noted too that "we are still paying
the consequences of these racial atti
tudes."
Jean-Charles spoke at length on Haiti's
history in order to make the audience
"understand the Duvaliers and their
legacy." He said that Haiti was the first
black nation to gain its independence,
winning it from the French in 1804.
The island was first united in 1801,
however, under Toussaint Louverture, a
black slave by birth who rose to power
only to be betrayed by one of his own
countrymen before he could live to see his
dream come true of an independent and
united Haiti, according to Jean-Charles.
Louverture, though, was part of the
constitution-creating group that still has
impact today in Haiti.
The Haitian political system, composed
of an executive, legislative and judicial
branch, was originally put into practice by
the followers of Louverture, Jean-Charles
said.
"This system has never worked,
though," he said. Indeed, Jean-Charles
said, it is probable that this system is the

root of many of the problems that Haiti is
currently having. "The president has al
ways been the strong man in our system;
the legislature has always been his pup
pet."
Francois Duvalierwas elected president
in the Haiti general elections in 1957 and
held office until 1963, Jean-Charles siad.
Duvalier's son, Jean-Claude Duvalier,
took office in 1971. "About the only posi
tive thing we can credit Jean-Claude
Duvalier with is killing less people than his
father, and maybe that's because most of
the dissenters were already killed," Jean-
Charles said.
"When Jean-Claude Duvalier assumed
office in April 1971 he said, 'My father
made a political revolution. 1 will make an
economic one.' Under the Duvaliers,
Haiti became the poorest country in the
American hemisphere,'' he said. Jean-
Charles noted that this was indeed a revo
lution, albeit an undesirable one.
Jean-Charles added that while attempts
at reform had been made in the past, most
notably the educational reform of 1979, it
was in general "a fiasco. In 1804, even
though plantations had been destroyed (to
spite the French), our agriculture was bet
ter off. Now, not only do peasants have no
agricultural help, but most have fled." The
result, Jean-Charles said, was that Haitian
imports of foodstuffs have increased
dramatically.

Jean-Charles added that while attempts
at reform had been made in the past, most
notably the educational reform of 1979, it
was in general "a fiasco. In 1804, even
though plantations had been destroyed (to
spite the French), our agriculture was bet
ter off. Now, not only do peasants have no
agricultural help, but most have fled." The
result, Jean-Charles said, was that Haitian
imports of foodstuffs have increased
dramatically.
