## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Focus house a bad idea 
### 
On the whole, Stanford students don't like to be told
what to do, much less how to do it. A recent case in
point is the University's attempt to establish a Latin
American/Iberian focus program in Yost House.
As proposed, "'focus houses" are halfway between a
general house, that has no structured programming, and
a theme house. In a letter to The Daily this Friday, As
sistant Dean of Residential Education Alice Supton
wrote that the "focus house" experiment would cluster
activities each quarter on the focus area, facilitate fac
ulty involvement in the dorm and foster commitment
to working on the program.
The aims of the "focus houses" are good ones. It
should be a primary goal of Residential Education to
inspire educational and cultural endeavors. However,
the lack of student input into the design of the "focus
houses" and the devotion of the majority of the
houses' activities to the focus stand out as glaring
weaknesses of the program.
The University solicited no advice from students
when the "focus house" plans were drawn up. In fact
the Yost residents, whom the proposal most intimately
effected, were not told that their house would have a
structured Latin American/Iberian focus until a little
less than two weeks before the Draw.
In her letter, Supton said programming at Yost would
not have a focus because of the lack of time to reach a

consensus on the desirability of establishing Yost as a
"focus house." Since students develop strong ties to
the house in which they reside, their concerns and
desires must be met before any new program is imple
mented. Altering the character of a residence is not a
matter that should be rushed.
The structured nature of the "focus house" unneces
sarily limits the freedom of the house to develop
programming. Ideally, the activities pursued by a house
should be the result of the interaction between resident
fellows and residents. The "focus house" would force
the house to devote a majority of its time and energy to
the particular area of concentration. Also, the charac
ter of a house changes from year to year; each
"generation" of house residents should be given the
opportunity to plan their own activities.
Edmundo Fuenzalida, who is to become Yost's RF
next year, has proposed programs that would bring
Latin American art, music and dance to Yost. Most
Yost residents expressed interest in these ideas and
said they would like to help Fuenzalida implment
them. So, why is the "focus house" label needed at all?
Due to the complaints of the residents, Yost will not
be a "focus house" next year. Res Ed should keep in
mind that programs developed for students must first
consider the students' desires.
