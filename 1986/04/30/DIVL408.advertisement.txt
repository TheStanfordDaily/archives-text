The residents of Adams House
and the Program in Human Biology
are pleased to announce
that for the 1986/87 school year
ADAMS HOUSE WILL HOST A
HUMAN BIOLOGY FOCUS PROGRAM
The most significant problems faced by humans in the next several
decades are not amenable to simple scientific, economic, or political
solutions. Therefore, the goal of the Human Biology Focus
Program will be to bring together students, faculty, and guests who
are interested in exploring interdisciplinary approaches to the
complex problems facing humans world-wide. Ten spaces in
Adams House have been reserved for students especially interested
in working with the Resident Fellows, a group of Faculty Fellows,
Resident Assistants, and other students in the planning and
implementation of special Focus activities. These spaces are
available to all interested students, regardless of major, guarantee
year status or draw number; those selected will receive a special
assignment to Adams. (Those selected who are guaranteed for
1986-87 will not receive an additional guaranteed year.)
To apply, write a short description of a program you would like to
organize in Adams next year, a brief description of yourself and
your professional goals, and a listing of activities in which you have
participated while at Stanford. Also have your current RF or RA
write a short letter of recommendation. Both the application and
recommendation should be sent by Monday, May 12 to: Human
Biology Focus, Office of Residential Education, Old Union.
