# Soviets suppress news of nuclear catastrophe
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Staff writer With wire reports 
Information on the Chernobyl nuclear acci
dent in the Ukraine has been more severely
suppressed within the Soviet Union than
many Western analysts have assumed, ac
cording to scholars here monitoring Soviet
television broadcasts.
While brief mention of the accident oc
curred on television news programs shown in
the western part of the Soviet Union near the
electrical generating plant, the scholars said
there were no references at all in four news
programs broadcast in the eastern area during
a two-day period.
Western analysts have speculated that a
chemical explosion Saturday or Sunday in the

Chernobyl reactor triggered a nuclear
meltdown.
''The hypothesis is that the Soviets are
try ing to give as little information as they can
to their people," said Louis Lerman, a Hertz
fellow in the applied physical sciences who is
assisting with the monitoring of the Soviet
television broadcasts. "The accident less di
rectly affects those in the east, in Siberia, and
they are less likely to find out about it. So why
tell them?"
The Stanford group is able to monitor
broadcasts made in the eastern part of the So
viet Union by intercepting the transmissions
from polar satellites in elliptical orbits. West
ern Soviet broadcasts are transmitted using
geostationary satellites and are not intercep
tible on the West Coast of the United States.
The Monday evening newscast "Vremya"

shown in Moscow briefly noted that an acci
dent had occurred and those affected were
being treated, according to ABC TV's
"Nightline." This was the first official men
tioning of the accident in the Soviet Union.

The program was aired at 9 p.m. Moscow
time "while Siberia slept' through the early
Tuesday morning hours, according to Ler
man.
The Tuesday evening "Vremya" newscast
shown in Siberia (at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday Mos
cow time) monitored by the tracking group
made no mention of the accident.
"Although I can't be sure, it is safe to
assume that that program never aired in Mos
cow," said Stuart Neubarth, the inventor of

the Stanford tracking system. Neubarth
earned his master's degree in electrical engi
neering here in 1983.
According to Lerman, Siberia's Tuesday
evening news included stories detailing new
"overproduction" in the nuclear energy in
dustry, how the transfer to nuclear energy
helped the environment, and the announce
ment that Swedish cities declared themselves
nuclear weapons free zones â€” but made no
reference to the accident.
The story about increased nuclear energy
production was part of the economic news,
which is always presented first, "but inclusion
of the nuclear industry is unusual," said
Vladimir Bukovsky, a well-known Soviet
dissident.
Bukovsky, a doctoral candidate here in psy
chology, said the stoiy about the ecological

benefits of nuclear power was "a very upbeat
piece" and included "very beautiful scenery:
flowers and blue skies surround a nuclear re
actor."
"They are trying to show that everything
about nuclear power is good," he said.
Bukovsky said information about the
Swedish nuclear-free zones was mentioned as
an attempt "at subconscious manipulation."
On Monday, Swedish officials demanded
information from the Soviet Union after con
cluding that radiation levels 10 times what is
normal were caused by fallout carried by
winds from the Soviet Union.
"Suppose someone heard something on the
Voice of America about Sweden and maybe
heard the word nuclear through the (Soviet)
