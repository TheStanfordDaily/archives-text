# Soviets suppress news of nuclear catastrophe
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Staff writer With wire reports 
Information on the Chernobyl nuclear acci
dent in the Ukraine has been more severely
suppressed within the Soviet Union than
many Western analysts have assumed, ac
cording to scholars here monitoring Soviet
television broadcasts.
While brief mention of the accident oc
curred on television news programs shown in
the western part of the Soviet Union near the
electrical generating plant, the scholars said
there were no references at all in four news
programs broadcast in the eastern area during
a two-day period.
Western analysts have speculated that a
chemical explosion Saturday or Sunday in the

Chernobyl reactor triggered a nuclear
meltdown.
''The hypothesis is that the Soviets are
try ing to give as little information as they can
to their people," said Louis Lerman, a Hertz
fellow in the applied physical sciences who is
assisting with the monitoring of the Soviet
television broadcasts. "The accident less di
rectly affects those in the east, in Siberia, and
they are less likely to find out about it. So why
tell them?"
The Stanford group is able to monitor
broadcasts made in the eastern part of the So
viet Union by intercepting the transmissions
from polar satellites in elliptical orbits. West
ern Soviet broadcasts are transmitted using
geostationary satellites and are not intercep
tible on the West Coast of the United States.
The Monday evening newscast "Vremya"

shown in Moscow briefly noted that an acci
dent had occurred and those affected were
being treated, according to ABC TV's
"Nightline." This was the first official men
tioning of the accident in the Soviet Union.

The program was aired at 9 p.m. Moscow
time "while Siberia slept' through the early
Tuesday morning hours, according to Ler
man.
The Tuesday evening "Vremya" newscast
shown in Siberia (at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday Mos
cow time) monitored by the tracking group
made no mention of the accident.
"Although I can't be sure, it is safe to
assume that that program never aired in Mos
cow," said Stuart Neubarth, the inventor of

the Stanford tracking system. Neubarth
earned his master's degree in electrical engi
neering here in 1983.
According to Lerman, Siberia's Tuesday
evening news included stories detailing new
"overproduction" in the nuclear energy in
dustry, how the transfer to nuclear energy
helped the environment, and the announce
ment that Swedish cities declared themselves
nuclear weapons free zones — but made no
reference to the accident.
The story about increased nuclear energy
production was part of the economic news,
which is always presented first, "but inclusion
of the nuclear industry is unusual," said
Vladimir Bukovsky, a well-known Soviet
dissident.
Bukovsky, a doctoral candidate here in psy
chology, said the stoiy about the ecological

benefits of nuclear power was "a very upbeat
piece" and included "very beautiful scenery:
flowers and blue skies surround a nuclear re
actor."
"They are trying to show that everything
about nuclear power is good," he said.
Bukovsky said information about the
Swedish nuclear-free zones was mentioned as
an attempt "at subconscious manipulation."
On Monday, Swedish officials demanded
information from the Soviet Union after con
cluding that radiation levels 10 times what is
normal were caused by fallout carried by
winds from the Soviet Union.
"Suppose someone heard something on the
Voice of America about Sweden and maybe
heard the word nuclear through the (Soviet)
jamming, but didn't get it clearly
enough. They wonder what it is
about, and later they see on the news
that Swedish cities have declared
themselves nuclear-free, and they
have their answer," Bukovsky said.
Bukovsky said the accident at
Chernobyl is a case in point. "They
can't suppress this for long," he said.
"It is too big. Too many people know
about it."
But this has not kept the Soviet
government from trying to contain
the announcements to the western
Soviet Union, those tracking Soviet
broadcasts suspect.
There was no mention on the two
afternoon news programs in the eas
tern half of the country, where
television reports focused on
"Honduras' provocation of
Nicaragua," the movement of U.S.
warships in the Mediterranean, and
the upcoming May Day celebrations.
Suppression of information about
internal disasters is common practice
in the Soviet Union, according to

Condoleezza Rice, an assistant pro
fessor of political science and a na
tional fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
"The first impulse in the West is to
try to gather information and let
people know what has happened, but
in the Soviet Union the first impulse
is to turn inward and keep things se
cret," said Rice, who is also assistant
director of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control.
Radio Moscow announced that
"the disaster was the first one at a
Soviet nuclear power plant in over 30
years," an apparent reference to the
1957 "Kyshtym Disaster'" in the eas
tern Ural mountains that is believed
to have caused as many as 200.000
deaths.
Rice pointed out that Radio Mos
cow is meant for external consump
tion. "They are operating on the
premise that their people will not be
listening," she said. The Soviets made
the concession "because it's common
knowledge in the West anyway, and
maybe the admission will ease foreign
pressure," she said.
In another report not publicized in
ternally, the Soviet news agency
TASS reported that two were killed

in the Chernobyl accident and severe
were injured.
But an unconfirmed report from ;
resident of the area said the death tol
surpassed 2,000, according to Unite(
Press International.
A U.S. State Department sourc<
said that satellite reconnaissanct
showed that a "small chemical explo
sion ignited the reactor's graphite
into a high-temperature blaze" that
resulted in at least a partial meltdown
of the fuel rods.
The Soviet reactor uses graphite as
a "moderator" to slow released
neutrons instead of water, which is
used in reactors in the United States,
according to Wolfgang Panofsky,
director emeritus of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Ed Zebroski, chief nuclear scientist
for the Electric Power Institute in
Palo Alto, said that the graphite fire
will take longer to bum out than a
regular fire of its size because the
graphite has stored chemical energy.
Putting out the fire has been made
more difficult by the fact that the ex
plosion apparently blew the roof of
the reactor off and cracked its walls,
meaning the fire cannot be
"smothered" by cutting it off from
oxygen.
Zebroski added that there is great
danger moving tire-fighting equip
ment in because of the high levels of
radiation. "I've heard people suggest
dropping loads of cement on it, or
tons ot water. It probably cannot be
put out by conventional means."
The Soviet Union has reportedly
asked the governments of West Ger
many and Sweden for information on
how to fight a graphite fire. Both
countries are cooperating with the re
quest.
Ihe United States "could be and
would be helpful if asked" by the
Soviets for assistance, White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan said yes
terday.
But in a resolution yesterday, the
House of Representatives criticized
the Soviet Union for endangering the
world by not notifying other nations
about the Chernobyl accident.

benefits of nuclear power was "a very upbeat
piece" and included "very beautiful scenery:
flowers and blue skies surround a nuclear re
actor."
"They are trying to show that everything
about nuclear power is good," he said.
Bukovsky said information about the
Swedish nuclear-free zones was mentioned as
an attempt "at subconscious manipulation."
On Monday, Swedish officials demanded
information from the Soviet Union after con
cluding that radiation levels 10 times what is
normal were caused by fallout carried by
winds from the Soviet Union.
"Suppose someone heard something on the
Voice of America about Sweden and maybe
heard the word nuclear through the (Soviet)
jamming, but didn't get it clearly
enough. They wonder what it is
about, and later they see on the news
that Swedish cities have declared
themselves nuclear-free, and they
have their answer," Bukovsky said.
Bukovsky said the accident at
Chernobyl is a case in point. "They
can't suppress this for long," he said.
"It is too big. Too many people know
about it."
But this has not kept the Soviet
government from trying to contain
the announcements to the western
Soviet Union, those tracking Soviet
broadcasts suspect.
There was no mention on the two
afternoon news programs in the eas
tern half of the country, where
television reports focused on
"Honduras' provocation of
Nicaragua," the movement of U.S.
warships in the Mediterranean, and
the upcoming May Day celebrations.
Suppression of information about
internal disasters is common practice
in the Soviet Union, according to

Condoleezza Rice, an assistant pro
fessor of political science and a na
tional fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
"The first impulse in the West is to
try to gather information and let
people know what has happened, but
in the Soviet Union the first impulse
is to turn inward and keep things se
cret," said Rice, who is also assistant
director of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control.
Radio Moscow announced that
"the disaster was the first one at a
Soviet nuclear power plant in over 30
years," an apparent reference to the
1957 "Kyshtym Disaster'" in the eas
tern Ural mountains that is believed
to have caused as many as 200.000
deaths.
Rice pointed out that Radio Mos
cow is meant for external consump
tion. "They are operating on the
premise that their people will not be
listening," she said. The Soviets made
the concession "because it's common
knowledge in the West anyway, and
maybe the admission will ease foreign
pressure," she said.
In another report not publicized in
ternally, the Soviet news agency
TASS reported that two were killed

in the Chernobyl accident and severe
were injured.
But an unconfirmed report from ;
resident of the area said the death tol
surpassed 2,000, according to Unite(
Press International.
A U.S. State Department sourc<
said that satellite reconnaissanct
showed that a "small chemical explo
sion ignited the reactor's graphite
into a high-temperature blaze" that
resulted in at least a partial meltdown
of the fuel rods.
The Soviet reactor uses graphite as
a "moderator" to slow released
neutrons instead of water, which is
used in reactors in the United States,
according to Wolfgang Panofsky,
director emeritus of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.
Ed Zebroski, chief nuclear scientist
for the Electric Power Institute in
Palo Alto, said that the graphite fire
will take longer to bum out than a
regular fire of its size because the
graphite has stored chemical energy.
Putting out the fire has been made
more difficult by the fact that the ex
plosion apparently blew the roof of
the reactor off and cracked its walls,
meaning the fire cannot be
"smothered" by cutting it off from
oxygen.
Zebroski added that there is great
danger moving tire-fighting equip
ment in because of the high levels of
radiation. "I've heard people suggest
dropping loads of cement on it, or
tons ot water. It probably cannot be
put out by conventional means."
The Soviet Union has reportedly
asked the governments of West Ger
many and Sweden for information on
how to fight a graphite fire. Both
countries are cooperating with the re
quest.
Ihe United States "could be and
would be helpful if asked" by the
Soviets for assistance, White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan said yes
terday.
But in a resolution yesterday, the
House of Representatives criticized
the Soviet Union for endangering the
world by not notifying other nations
about the Chernobyl accident.
Information on the Chernobyl nuclear acci
dent in the Ukraine has been more severely
suppressed within the Soviet Union than
many Western analysts have assumed, ac
cording to scholars here monitoring Soviet
television broadcasts.
While brief mention of the accident oc
curred on television news programs shown in
the western part of the Soviet Union near the
electrical generating plant, the scholars said
there were no references at all in four news
programs broadcast in the eastern area during
a two-day period.
Western analysts have speculated that a
chemical explosion Saturday or Sunday in the

Chernobyl reactor triggered a nuclear
meltdown.
''The hypothesis is that the Soviets are
try ing to give as little information as they can
to their people," said Louis Lerman, a Hertz
fellow in the applied physical sciences who is
assisting with the monitoring of the Soviet
television broadcasts. "The accident less di
rectly affects those in the east, in Siberia, and
they are less likely to find out about it. So why
tell them?"
The Stanford group is able to monitor
broadcasts made in the eastern part of the So
viet Union by intercepting the transmissions
from polar satellites in elliptical orbits. West
ern Soviet broadcasts are transmitted using
geostationary satellites and are not intercep
tible on the West Coast of the United States.
The Monday evening newscast "Vremya"

shown in Moscow briefly noted that an acci
dent had occurred and those affected were
being treated, according to ABC TV's
"Nightline." This was the first official men
tioning of the accident in the Soviet Union.

The program was aired at 9 p.m. Moscow
time "while Siberia slept' through the early
Tuesday morning hours, according to Ler
man.
The Tuesday evening "Vremya" newscast
shown in Siberia (at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday Mos
cow time) monitored by the tracking group
made no mention of the accident.
"Although I can't be sure, it is safe to
assume that that program never aired in Mos
cow," said Stuart Neubarth, the inventor of

the Stanford tracking system. Neubarth
earned his master's degree in electrical engi
neering here in 1983.
According to Lerman, Siberia's Tuesday
evening news included stories detailing new
"overproduction" in the nuclear energy in
dustry, how the transfer to nuclear energy
helped the environment, and the announce
ment that Swedish cities declared themselves
nuclear weapons free zones — but made no
reference to the accident.
The story about increased nuclear energy
production was part of the economic news,
which is always presented first, "but inclusion
of the nuclear industry is unusual," said
Vladimir Bukovsky, a well-known Soviet
dissident.
