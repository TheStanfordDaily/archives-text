Honor code
a sign of trust
I read of a growing number of vio
lations of the Honor Code, and I get a
knot in the pit of my stomach each
time I hear a suggestion that the
Honor Code should be abandoned.
You don't let something that is
great slide away because of distorted
ideas of loyalty to friends and not
being a squealer.
When I entered Stanford in 1935,
it was with great pride that I was
going to a school that operated on the
Honor Code. I was young — but this
was a sign that, despite my youth, my
teachers would trust me.
I had a warm feeling each time I
wrote on the outside of a blue book,
"No unpermitted aid given or
received" and signed my name
"Robert Kahn."
When I met my friends who went
to Berkeley or to other schools, and I
listened to them talk of the proctor
who roamed the room when they
were taking tests and of the ways
people cheated, I again had a good
warm feeling.
There are many things in life that
lead us astray and often we cannot
change them. It will be the misfortune
of many students at Stanford today to
work for companies who are dis
honest, companies whose conduct vi
olates their personal code. It puts
them in the position of having to
leave what may be an interesting and
a challenging job, a job with a future
that might not even involve them in
the dishonesty or immorality of the
company. And they may not be able
to change the company.
But here at Stanford, they can
change it. It is possible for one or a

few people to say out loud, "I am not
going to cheat, and I will report all
who cheat."
It is a strange thing in life that each
person feels alone. Each person feels
that his ethical standards are higher
than those among his peers. And he
only feels that because he doesn't
know how his peers feel, and he
doesn't know how his peers feel be
cause he is considered a sissy if he
talks about such things.
I have talked to tens of thousands
of people on the subject of "Can you
have an ethical and a profitable busi
ness?" When I am talking to a group
from a single company where the
management team has known each
other for a long time, I ask each per
son to write on a little slip of paper
whether he feels his personal, ethical
standards are higher than, the same
or lower than that of the peer group
with which he is working. I expect —
and frequently find — that 65 percent
feel that their standards are higher
than the others in their group. But
that is a mathematical impossibility.
It arises only because they don't un
derstand how the person working
next to them feels. And they don't
understand because they don't talk'
about it.
It has been more than 50 years
since I entered Stanford. I know the
world changes. We didn't have jet
planes or television or VCRs or
atomic bombs or nuclear power
plants: nor could we put a man in
space or shoot a laser to the moon.
The world must change.
But our standards need not.
What does it gain Stanford to be
recognized as the greatest university
in the United States — while at the
same time losing the Honor Code?

Sarcasm backfired
Sarcasm is a difficult literary instru
ment to wield, for its sharp edge can
shred its author as easily as his in
tended target. This is the fate of
Christopher Deßosa, who wrote on
April 24 (" 'World Culture:' where
will it end?' ") to ridicule critics of the
Western Culture Program, but
succeeded only in ridiculing himself.
Deßosa's foolish and insensitive
remarks will find little support among
the faculty teaching in the eight
tracks, many of whom are deeply
concerned about the white/male bias
that virtually inheres in a program
oriented around the established
canon of "Great Books." Serious dis
cussions are underway regarding pos
sible strategies for redressing this sit
uation.
The basic issue, as most students
and faculty have recognized, is not
some sort of obligation to represent
all peoples of the globe in the course,
but rather to reexamine the question,
"What in fact is the West itself?"
Recent scholarship, of which Deßosa
is embarrassingly ignorant, assures us
that the meaning of "Western Cul
ture" is not exhausted by the authors
of the Great Books, as vital as they
are to any liberal — and liberating —
education.
Western Culture is the only course
required of every undergraduate at
Stanford, and as such it deserves
more intelligent examination than
Deßosa is capable of. We ask that he
not complicate the work of the many
responsible groups and individuals in
our community that are grappling
with issues so far over his head.
