## Restrictions encourage alcohol excesses 
### 
There are a number of potential routes which can
be and have been taken in the discussion of campus
alcohol policy. The simplest and most harmful
route is to finger one organization, usually the most
visible, such as fraternities, as being the
blameworthy.
Another route presents itself as being more ana
lytic. summing up its philosophy in the glib phrase
"each is responsible for his own." Presumably this
means that judgment should concern individuals
who are drunk and disorderly and not deal with the
issues of the alcohol itself or the provider of the al-

cohol. The credibility of this route is quickly called
into question. It makes the incorrect assumption
that "each" is prima facie responsible for his own,
and then attempts to make judgments about how
that individual/organization fares in its ownership
of personal responsiblity.
The complex issue which needs to be unravelled
is precisely this responsibility: the social responsi
bility of individuals to their community, that of the
University to its professional and student body, and
that of the fraternities to the University and its
members. It seems that few of these responsibilities
are being met. Instead of dealing with these issues,
quick offhand solutions are being spouted from
various parts of the community. Before continuing
with the discussion of responsibility, it is essential
to dismiss these spoutings.
Prohibition pushes the prohibited underground
— historical precedent screams this. Freshmen,
sophomores, anyone who wants alcohol is going to
get it — somehow — for whatever reason: frater

nity party, birthday party, Big Game or to get
drunk.
The key in the analysis is not to rid ourselves of
the problem by literally attempting to get rid of the
issue, banning alcohol altogether. The key is for the
University to focus in on the abuses, to ask why
there is irresponsibility in drinking. The Univer
sity's role is not to play mandate maker, but more,
to teach students how to make decisions for them
selves, and to instill in them a sense of responsibil
ity.
Institution policies, however, are difficult to
' decipher because the "fundamental principles"
upon which an institution claims to be founded are
often ambiguous, as testified by the Stanford ad
ministration's handling of the South Africa. The
administration was not clear in its own mind what
policies to adopt, and it appeared that student pres
sure proved to be the motivating factor which
forced it to clarify its principles to itself as well as to
the rest of the world, principles which had before
remained in the corporate state of suspended
animation, of being "unstated and understood." As
of now. therefore, a student cannot turn to the ad
ministration for advice because there is am
bivalence. vacillation and disparity in policy and
words.
It is also difficult for a student to turn to the aca
demic community for policy advice because, with
the brilliant exception of the South Africa issue, it
keeps silent. The academic community is heavily
involved not only in research, but also in intra
institutional politics. This leads academics to deem
it wise to put their academic mouths where their
tenure is.
At an institution of higher education, it is time to
see some real world education. Parts of Europe

provide a special example of a drinking policy
which has become cultural tradition —wine is gen
erally on the table and available to an individual
from birth. As such, alcohol is not restricted as in
the United States and does not invite abuse; if you
can have it all the time, you stop wanting it all the
time. The gleam of being illegal or against the rules
is removed.

Prohibition pushes the
prohibited underground
— historical precedent
screams this.

It is important, here in the United States, to
engage in open discussion and ask what effects an
open alcohol policy might have, not in the short
run, but in a broader scope. Cultural changes do
not subscribe to the Stanford quarter system. If we
do not discuss the issue in this light, people who are
too busy, or just generally "above discussion,"
might find themselves continually hassled by enfor
cers of the prohibition stature, and unable to un
derstand why they are required to obey.
An abuse of alcohol will continue, incomprehen
sible to the administration, which will still fail to see
that the issue is not how to eliminate alcohol, but
how to keep it.
