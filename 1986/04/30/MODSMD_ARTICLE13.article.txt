# Morality and legal fairness
## 
### 
Approximately six months ago I and 60 other Stanford
community members were arrested while sitting-in at Old
Union to protest Stanford's investments in South Africa.
Most of us were also protesting the Stanford administra
tion's failure to act decisively in response to the mistreat
ment of Stanford students by Stanford police officers and
to the brutal beating of one student by a Santa Clara
sheriffs deputy.
But that is old news, and presumably, tired news.
Likewise, approximately two weeks ago 20 of us went to
trial in an attempt to be acquitted of our charges. This
failed, as have so many other civil disobedience cases, and
we were all charged with unlawful assembly. This too is
old news, at least to most people. But to me, it is still cur
rent, and it has raised several issues in my mind about civil
disobedience, student activism and the legal system which
I'd like to share. If it is old news, so be it.

During the trial I felt constantly confronted with the
issue of law versus morality, of what exactly constitutes
law and whether morality has or should play a part in law.
Most people, including myself, would agree that law is
based on some form of morality, on a basic moral code
which is agreed upon implicitly by members of a society.
Murder is bad, it is unlawful, as are rape, theft and
trespassing. These laws have been derived from a general
moral code against which few people would argue. Yet of
course, there arise cases which seem to bring into conflict
our morals and our laws.
One classic case concerns a person who steals bread for
his family: is this theft? Likewise, a person who enters a
burning building unlawfully to save a child; is this
trespassing? This was the type of argument our lawyers at
tempted to use, a defense of necessity. Though I hoped it
would be accepted by the judge as a valid defense (it
wasn't), I had many qualms about what it would mean for
our legal system if it were. Would this legal philosophy
lead people to break the law whenever they disagreed
with a policy, point of view or point of law? And what
would it mean if we opened up the possibility of allowing
our courts to judge explicitly the morality of an action,
and not solely on its legality?
There is no doubt in my mind, and I hope in most all of
our minds, that apartheid is a "moral evil," and needs to
be dismantled. The horrors of the apartheid system are
well-documented. Yet, even though we are all agreed on
the morality, or lack thereof, inherent in the South
African system, the means for helping to destroy the
South African minority-ruled government are hotly
debated, as most of us have seen in the last year. I believe
that divestment is "morally correct," but many others do
not, and it would be scary for me to see a court deciding a
matter of law based on its opinion of the best method to
end apartheid.

A court must stay within its boundaries of law in decid
ing an issue. If actions such as sit-ins and trespassing were
allowed because the issues for which the people were act
ing were noble or "morally correct" there would only be
more problems raised in our society and legal system. The
courts would begin to have free reign to decide other
moral issues, such as abortion, and be able to declare
people guilty or innocent based on the morality behind
their breaking the law. If we had been declared innocent
of trespassing because we were fighting for something
which was "morally correct" the ramifications for our le
gal system would be far more disastrous than if we had
been declared guilty.
Of course, this wasn't the only issue we were raising,
and it was not the only reason we were fighting for a
defense of necessity. The point behind the defense was
that the University has squelched, and quite effectively at
that, much of the opportunity of the students to use their
First Amendment rights to express their disagreement
with the University's policies. I have no doubt that the
Stanford administration has stopped the dissent concern
ing divestment and police brutality through means suÂ» h as
tearing down posters, stopping the showing of movies and
publishing the booklet "Stanford and South Africa" as
supposedly representative of the viewpoints of both sides.
One of the main reasons I wanted the trial to go
through was so the evidence which I believe would show
much of this could be offered to public view. But still the
point remains, it seems to me, and questions about my ac
tions keep surfacing. What determines the point at which
rational discourse is no longer possible, and actions, such
as sitting-in, are allowable or even morally responsible? I
have yet to come to an answer, but my first impression is
that the point at which we acted was not it. 1 think many
people, including myself, were acting out of frustration
with an administration that treats its students like peons,
and looks at us as if we were only future alumni who will
help to further their goal of national and worldwide
renown. But is this frustration in the name of perhaps
unsavory business practices reason enough to break the
law, including with it an expectation to be released from
the guidelines of punishment?
We must all act as individuals, and respect the actions of
other individuals. At some point, however, we must
declare a legal guideline by which all members of a society
must be judged. Subjective morality is supposedly the
basis of law, but at some point it must be separated from
it, and law must be presumed objective. We were acting
for what I believe are morally correct reasons. In so doing,
alas, we were acting in defiance of the law. And in the
courtroom, when law clashes with morality, law mast win
out. If there were not clear guidelines to the law (or as
clear as we can make them), innocence and guilt would be
whimsical determinants by the judge or jury, based on
their view of the moral validity of the cause, and our legal
system would degenerate into the anarchy which charac
terizes such systems as those we are protesting.
To include moral righteousness, which is inherently
subjective, as a prerequisite for guilt or innocence would
only expand the power of the court by giving it the ability
to judge on morality, as well as law.
