## Student lends a robotic hand to space effort 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
A robot designed to perform space
labor and reduce the dangerous time
astronauts spend outside of
spacecraft is being developed by
Stanford electrical engineering
graduate student Harold Alexander,
who is working with Stanford's De
partment of Aeronautics and
Astronautics.
The robot consists of an "arm,"
complete with an "elbow" joint, at
tached to a base by a "shoulder"
joint. The end of the arm could be
fitted with some sort of gripper,
which would act like a hand. The two
joints allow the arm to have a wide
range of movement in the two
dimensional plane of the table top on
which it rests. Eventually, Alexander
hopes to make advances in control
techniques that would allow the de
velopment of a robot equipped for
three-dimensional work. The move
ment of the robot is controlled by a
microcomputer — similar to the
IBM-PC — housed in the base.
T he base and arm float on a cus
lujn of compressed nitrogen gas,
which simulates the lack of friction
that makes directed movement in
space difficult. The problem is best
summarized by Isaac Newton's third
law of motion, which says that for

every force exerted there is an equal
and opposite force generated.
"If you're on rollerskates and you
reach out your arm, you go back
wards from the reaction forces," Al
exander said as an analogy.
The problem is solved by program
ming the computer to compensate for
the extra motion involved in the
robot's activities. Part of the way in
which the robot's movement is
planned results from pictures taken
by a small camera positioned on the
robot above its arm. The camera is
sensitive to infrared light, and "sees"
infrared-emitting diodes placed on
the targets for which the arm is
aiming. The emphasis on the targets
results from the need to plan move
ment in relation to the target instead
of the base, because the base will
move when the arm does.
The idea for using a gas cushion
model to develop a robot designed
for space came from another gas
cushion model in Stanford's labs. This
inspirational model depicts satellite
movement, and Alexander estimates
that it is 20 years old.
Alexander foresees a number of
ways in which astronauts will direct
his robot. Initially, astronauts will
probably use a joystick system to con
trol the robot's movement, he said.
An example of one possible system
given by Alexander consisted of one

joystick controlling the general
movement of the base, and one
directing the tip of the arm. Alexan
der says that he is currently working
on the software for these types of
movement.
Alexander hopes that the
astronauts will eventually be able to
interact with the robot on a higher
level, along the lines of telling the
robot to go somewhere and do some
thing, he said.
That kind of "artificial intelli
gence" is "what we're aiming for,"
Alexander said.
NASA is sponsoring Alexander's
project and has expressed interest in
testing the robot in the shuttle bay or
in the proposed space station, accord
ing to Alexander. Alexander said he
hopes the robot will be ready for
space in the mid - 19905.
According to Alexander, this is
only intended to reduce the time that
humans must spend outside of
spacecraft, which is particularly dan
gerous, not to replace astronauts by
automatons.
"I really don't see anybody letting
that happen," Alexander said, refer
ring to the possibility of replacing
astronauts by robots.
Besides, Alexander said, he himself
would like to go into space.
"I don't want to completely ob
solete myself before I get a chance."
