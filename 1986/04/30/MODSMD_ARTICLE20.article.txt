# BRAIN STEW
## Sgnilpmud Amgems Htiw Investment Interruptus 
### 
My name is Michael, I got a nickel, I got a
nickel, shiny and new. No! My name is really
Robo-Man, and I have human brains for lunch!! I
brainwashed the Senate into divesting. The Sen
ate voted at its last meeting to divest $625,000
from the University's Merged Pool "B" and up to
$700,000 from its Expendable Funds pool. See,
Robo-Man can do anything!!
Ha-ha-ha. I made the Senate take all of its
money out of University investments in compan
ies that do business with South Africa. Even
Robo-men hate Botha. Except for when he puts
humans in boxes. That's o.k. with us. $400,000 of
the ASSU's $700,000 in the Expendable Funds
Pool belongs to student groups that must bank
with the ASSU. I have left those groups the choice
to divest or not. Robo-Man hereby commands
student groups to give their treasurers orders.
Treasurers must tell the ASSU if they wish to
divest or not. All money pulled out of Expendable
Funds goes into the more socially-responsible and
Robo-Man acceptable Working Assets.
Robo-men, of course, have no need for money.
Toasters! We want your toasters!
The change-over from Merge Pool "B" will take
place in the next few weeks; the switch from the
Expendable Funds pool in late May or early June.
