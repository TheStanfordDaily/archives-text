# I Like Opening
## 
### 
Openings are fun. Many things can have openings. The kindly
grocer on the corner can have a grand opening of his market to
sell his wares to friendly neighbors. A door can have an opening. I
have a small opening, actually a fleshy crack, on the heel of my
foot that makes Tim sick whenever he thinks about it. Equally
important are the committee openings for the Nominations Com
mission for 1986-1987, such as the Committee on Libraries.
THIS IS THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH YOU MUST GO IN
ORDER TO SERVE ON A COMMITTEE:
1. More information about the committees is available in the
Nominations Commission Office. After deciding which commit
tee (s) (x) you would like to serve on, pick up an application in
either the Nom Com office or the ASSU Business Office. Pretend
you arc a goldfish. Wear a glass bowl over your head and request
that people constantly shower you with water. When you see a
cat, run away.
2. Turn in an application for each committee by 5 pm on Mon
day, May 5 in the Nom Com office, or turn it in by Blortz o'clock
on Kilcho, Zinka Pu on the planet Shoeballs.
3. If you have been granted an interview, your name will be on a
list posted outside the Nom Com office on May 2. You may then
sign up for one of the interviews, which begin on May 3. If you
have not been granted an interview, do not despair, for soon the
Angel of Death will smite all living into the dust, and when you
get to Heaven, St. Peter will probably not ask you whether you
served on Nom Com but, rather if you ever had fun at a cookout
and whether you wore properly soled shoes.
4. For more information, stop by the Nom Com office or call 725-
1464. Nom Com office hours are Mondays 3-5, Wednesdays 1-3,
Borg-Nastase 3-2, Fridays 1-3, and Red Sox-Angels 5-3.
Finally, I have been requested by a Nom Com person to "make
a desperate plea to graduate students," however, this person ne
glected to tell me what to make a plea for. Therefore, "I plead to
your, graduate students, to come and wash my car, please. Thank
vou."
