We got to thinking the other night, after a grilling
session with some student groups (stoke coals every
ten minutes; rotate smoothly; add sauce as needed;
serves several, but never as many as it did before it
came in); why are we funding student groups? No,
really. Why the groups and not the programs?
What we may do is start interviewing groups about
their programs and not worry about who they are or
how much money they've gotten before. If the Head
less Horseman Hat Company puts on programs ten
times as good as the Hatless Headman Horse Com
pany, why not buy 10 times more hats? Groups are
smarter than we are, anyway. If they want more fund
ing, they'll just go and form ten other groups and ap
ply. If we funded by programs, we wouldn't care.
And while we're at it, we may change the rules that
keep us from funding food and travel. Who wants to
hear speakers when they can eat and fly? Hell, the
Daily nuked the Party Fund and still left themselves
$3,500 in Edit Munchies, so why can't real students?
And KZSU has $4,800 in travel to cover sports — no
shit, to fly across the country and broadcast baseball —
so why can't we fund people to take the bus to EPA
and teach in the barrios? Or maybe we could fund the
Daily to go to EPA. And give out Edit Munchies.
And anyway, we have to start funding food and
travel, because if we see one more speaker series pro
posal come by here, we're going to puke. We want to
fund cheese — lots of it. Swiss cheese, American
cheese, Arabian cheese — cheese of ethnically diverse
origins. Tell me you could get cheese like that without
the student government getting involved.
