# WHAT YOU DID:

Hey, all those constitutional amendments
passed. Does anyone have any idea what they
mean? I sure don't. I asked Carey to explain it to
me, and he gave me this list. I'm still confused.
Amendment Amendment (CA #4)
This amendment lets you amend it (or any other
amendment you want to amend) any time you want
to. Before this amendment, you could only amend the
constitution three times a year. Now you can do it any
time you want. Isn't that great? Only now it's a little
harder — it takes 15 percent, not five percent, peti
tions. We changed this because we discovered that 5%
is too easy — three people working with three peti
tions can get 5% of the students in one dinner, which
tends to make the Constitution as stable as Hammer
Teddy.
Recall You Rude Names (CA#5)
This amendment breaks up long, boring paragraphs
into shorter, boring paragraphs. It also raises petition
requirements to keep people from calling special elec
tions just for initiatives, referenda, recall, and the exis
tence of God unless they have a good reason and lots
of support. But with 5% you can toss a referendum on
the ballot of an already-called election anytime you
want. Have a referendum on us.
Passing the Bucks (CA #6)
It's out of our hands now. You decide whether the
Association Fee ($6/qtr; the other $10/qtr is Special
Fees) is $200,000 or $200,000,000. Vote it up, vote it
down; what the hell,you don't get your vote published
in the Daily, and you're not running for office, so vote
your conscience. Dice will be available at the polls for
those who have no conscience. Daily editorial pages
will be available at the polls for those who have no
minds.
