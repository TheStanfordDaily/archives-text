## Cardinal doubles roll back Waves 5-4 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
For several games in yesterday's
match between Stanford's Eric
Rosenfeld and Pepperdine's
Augustine Moreno, the tennis balls
looked more like nerf balls. All
frayed and fuzzy, the balls flew threw
the air in strange shapes, due to the
myriad of spins Rosenfeld and
Moreno were putting on them.
When the spheres came down, it
was hard to tell how they were going
to bounce.
And so it went throughout yester
day's unpredictable match between
the Cardinal and the Waves. No one
was quite sure what was going to hap
pen next, and until the Cardinal
doubles team of Rosenfeld and Scott
Moody finally clinched the match for
Stanford, every bounce was crucial.

The two teams split the singles
matches, with Stanford taking the No.
1, No. 2 and No. 3 matches and Pep
perdine winning No. 4, No. 5 and No.
6. The sixth-ranked Cardinal then
took two of the three doubles
matches to upend the No. 5 Waves by
a 5-4 score.
The Stanford victory avenged a 5-1
loss to Pepperdine back in February.
In that match the Cardinal played
without senior Jim Grabb, and yes
terday Pepperdine suffered a similar
fate. Wave sophomore Robbie Weiss
injured his knee in practice on Mon
day and couldn't play yesterday.
The unpredictable element came
into play when the three singles losers
for Stanford, Rosenfeld, Moody and
John Letts, came back strong in the
doubles to carry the team to victory.
"That was the key for us," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "They won

the match for us â€” it's as simple as
that."
Letts, who wasn't on the court long
enough to get even a light tan in his
quick 6-1, 6-1 singles loss to Doug
Sachs, made an amazing turnaround
in doubles play.
The senior teamed up with sopho
more Patrick McEnroe in the No. 2
doubles match to defeat Pepperdine's
Gilberto Cicero and Craig Johnson.
After a slow start, Letts and McEnroe
found a groove and won the last eight
games to post the 6-4, 6-0 victory.
Rosenfeld and Moody had each
lost rather heartbreaking singles
matches. Rosenfeld's loss was a mar
athon three-setter, while Moody's
comeback bid against Johnson fell
just short in the second set.
But the two Cardinal players tossed
their defeats out the window and
jumped to a fast 3-0 lead against

Sachs and Martin Laurendeau.
Rosenfeld and Moody then both held
serve to win the first set 6-3.
Sachs and Laurendeau then swung
the momentum back to Pepperdine's
side by breaking serve twice and
taking a 4-1 lead in the second set.
But rather than fold, Rosenfeld and
Moody dug in and seemed to win the
rest of the key points in the match.
The Cardinal pair won the last five
games to take the match 6-3, 6-4 and
clinch the team victory for Stanford.
Rosenfeld's singles match was the
most interesting of the day. He and
Moreno pounded top-spin and back
spin shots from the baseline until the
balls were so fuzzy they looked more
like kiwi fruit than tennis balls.
Rosenfeld pounded Moreno into
submission in the first set 6-2, and
was ahead 4-2 in the second before
the tide turned. Moreno held his
serve and broke Rosenfeld's to even
the score at 4-4.
"After I broke him to make it 4-4
in the second, I knew I was going to
win," Moreno said after the match.
Well, it wasn't that obvious at the
time. The two battled to a tie
breaker, which Moreno won handily
7-1.
With new, more lively balls in play
and two hours already elapsed, the
third set showcased two tired players.
The pace of play became slower, but
the score stayed even throughout.
With the score knotted at five
games apiece, Moreno broke Rosen
feld's serve and then was serving for
the match. Moreno took the first
three points of the game, and on the
fourth point Rosenfeld hit a shot near
the baseline which Moreno called
out.
And chaos ensued.
Rosenfeld voiced considerable dis
agreement, but Moreno swore the
shot was long. After a few minutes of
heated discussion, the umpire gave
Rosenfeld the point. But in the end it
didn't matter, because on the next
point Moreno passed Rosenfeld with
a big forehand shot and the three
hour marathon was finally over.
The No. 1 singles result was also a
hard one to predict. In February,
Pepperdine's Kelly Jones laid waste
to Stanford's Dan Goldie 6-2, 6-0.

But yesterday it was Goldie who
wielded destruction, defeating Kelly
6-4, 6-2.
In the No. 2 singles, Grabb, who
has played only nine matches this
year due to nagging injuries, out
lasted Laurendeau 7-6, 6-7, 6-3. The
performances weren't pretty, but as
Gould said, "Jim always finds a way
to win."
One thing that was predictable yes
terday was a singles victory by-

McEnroe. The sophomore had won
16 out of his 18 contests going into
the match against Pepperdine's Dani
Leal.
Yesterday McEnroe started slowly
in both sets, but erased all doubts by
winning the last four games in the
first set and the last five games in the
second set to gain his 17th victory by
a 6-4, 6-4 score.

It wasn't the most artistic match, but Stanford's Jim Grabb outlasted Pepperdine's Martin Laurendeau 7-6,
6-7, 6-3 in No. 2 singles to help the Cardinal to a 5-4 victory yesterday over the Waves. "Jim always finds a
way to win," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.

Earlier in the season, Dan Goldie was beaten easily by Pepperdine's
Kelly Jones, but yesterday the Stanford senior returned the favor,
blasting Jones in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2.
