## 
### JOHN POLLACK 
Stanford's 1984-85 gift income of
>125.4 million, the highest in the Univer
sity's history, reflects a nationwide in
crease in donations to higher education,
according to a survey released Monday.
Among private schools, Stanford's
$ 125.4 million trails only Harvard Univer
sity's total of $145.6 million, according to
a survey conducted by the Council for Fi
nancial Aid to Education. Both Stanford
and Harvard ranked behind the University
of California system, which received
$ 178.4 million in gifts during the period.
Stanford received $56.1 million in gifts
from individuals, $36.4 million from cor

potations and $32.9 million from founda
tions and associations in 1984-85, Bruce
Hinchliffe, associate vice president and
director of development, told the San Jose
Mercury News.
One of the top contributors nationwide,
International Business Machines, Corp.
(IBM), donated $55 million to education,
primarily in business, management, engi
neering and physical sciences, the survey
said.
While David Fulton. Stanford's director
of communications in the Office of Devel
opment. didn't know the exact amount
IBM donated to Stanford, he said IBM
gave "very generously."
Behind the UC system, Harvard and

Stanford, colleges and universities receiv
ing the most private donations were: the
University of Texas s\stem. $120.7 mil
lion: Columbia University, $93.4 million:
Cornell University, $91.9 million; Yale
University. $85.4 million: Princeton Uni
versity, $79.4 million: Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, $78.3 million; Uni
versity of Illinois, $70.7 million; Univer
sity of Minnesota. $66.2 million; and Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, $66 million.
Stanford's fund-raising experience "has
been steadily up through the '70s and into
the '80s," Fulton said.
The upcoming Centennial Campaign,
for which no dollar goal has been set, will
emphasize "increased annual giving" from

alumni and other individuals, Fulton said.
Regarding William Hewlett's recent per
sonal gift of $50 million to Stanford, Ful
ton said, "It sets a wonderful example,
doesn't it."*
I think Stanford will have to seek gifts
from all categories of givers well into the
future," he said.
Stanford's entry into the "modern era"
of fund raising came in 1961 with a
"cornerstone gift" of $25 million from the
Ford Foundation, Fulton said.
During this period, Stanford President
Wallace Sterling and Provost Frederick
Terman formed an "ambitious team" that
"wanted a very significant improvement
in Stanford's quality," Fulton said.
