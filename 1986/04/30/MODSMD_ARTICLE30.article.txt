It was better late than never for
Greg Baty in yesterday's National
Football League draft.
The All Pacific 10 Conference
tight end was chosen in the eighth
round by the American Football
Conference champion New Eng
land Patriots, the only Stanford
player drafted. Baty, along with
most football experts, expected he
would be tabbed sooner.
"The latest I saw in any draft
report (published before the draft)
was the sixth round, and I saw
about 20," Baty said. "I saw some
as high as the second or third, but I
saw myself going from four to six.
It's kind of a disappointment."
Although he wasn't pleased
with when he was picked, Baty
was quite happy with by whom he
was taken. "If I could have picked
five teams before the draft (that he
most wanted to play for), the Pats
would have been one of them," he
said. "I wanted to be on a coast,
and my girlfriend will be living on
the East Coast."
Baty was also happy to be
reunited with former Stanford
teammate Garin Veris, a defensive

end for New England. "Garin is a
fraternity brother (Theta Delta
Chi) and a good friend," Baty
said. "He'll be able to show me the
ropes. I don't want him to baby
me, but it's always nice to have a
friend around, especially in a new
situation."
It wasn't exactly a nail-biting
day next to the phone for Baty. He
spent most of his time "hitting ten
nis balls around and laying out by
the pool" at the home of another
friend and fraternity brother, Earl
Koberlein. "It wasn't too pres
sured, until about six rounds had
gone by."
As the hours passed, Baty
became more and more con
cerned. "I was thinking, 'Did they
mess up my report? Do they think
I'm on drugs (many players tested
positive for cocaine and marijuana
at scouting workouts in January)?
What if my report got mixed up
with someone else's?' "
At about 7:15 p.m., Baty's
worries were over. Relief
overcame his disappointment
when his agent, Tony Agnone,
called him with the news. Baty's
father, who had been watching the
