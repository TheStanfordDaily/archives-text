# Baty picked in eighth round of NFL draft
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
It was better late than never for
Greg Baty in yesterday's National
Football League draft.
The All Pacific 10 Conference
tight end was chosen in the eighth
round by the American Football
Conference champion New Eng
land Patriots, the only Stanford
player drafted. Baty, along with
most football experts, expected he
would be tabbed sooner.
"The latest I saw in any draft
report (published before the draft)
was the sixth round, and I saw
about 20," Baty said. "I saw some
as high as the second or third, but I
saw myself going from four to six.
It's kind of a disappointment."
Although he wasn't pleased
with when he was picked, Baty
was quite happy with by whom he
was taken. "If I could have picked
five teams before the draft (that he
most wanted to play for), the Pats
would have been one of them," he
said. "I wanted to be on a coast,
and my girlfriend will be living on
the East Coast."
Baty was also happy to be
reunited with former Stanford
teammate Garin Veris, a defensive

end for New England. "Garin is a
fraternity brother (Theta Delta
Chi) and a good friend," Baty
said. "He'll be able to show me the
ropes. I don't want him to baby
me, but it's always nice to have a
friend around, especially in a new
situation."
It wasn't exactly a nail-biting
day next to the phone for Baty. He
spent most of his time "hitting ten
nis balls around and laying out by
the pool" at the home of another
friend and fraternity brother, Earl
Koberlein. "It wasn't too pres
sured, until about six rounds had
gone by."
As the hours passed, Baty
became more and more con
cerned. "I was thinking, 'Did they
mess up my report? Do they think
I'm on drugs (many players tested
positive for cocaine and marijuana
at scouting workouts in January)?
What if my report got mixed up
with someone else's?' "
At about 7:15 p.m., Baty's
worries were over. Relief
overcame his disappointment
when his agent, Tony Agnone,
called him with the news. Baty's
father, who had been watching the
draft in New York, telephoned soon after.
When I got the call, I thought they were in the 1 Ith
round or something, but the draft was running late," Baty
said. "I thought, 'Oh, my god, it's the 11th round. I'm not
gonna get drafted.' "
The 6-foot-6 senior from Sparta, N.J., who caught 61
passes for 690 yards last season, blamed his late selection
partly on the general trend of the draft, which was toward
running backs and offensive linemen.
"The first tight ends were supposed to be taken in the
second, but the first one was in the fourth (Eric Kodish of
Michigan), Baty said. "With all those running backs and
linemen being taken, the teams must have been thinking,
'We've got to get one.' "
Baty was the only member of the Cardinal to be selec
ted in the 12 rounds. Offensive lineman John Barns and
inside linebacker Matt Soderlund were thought to be po
tential draftees but were not chosen.
Both may try out as free agents during summer training
camps, but neither could be reached for comment late last
night. Barns is currently at his parents' home in Dallas,
while Soderlund is studying abroad at Oxford.
Three Pac-10 players were drafted in the first round.
Linebacker Joe Kelly of Washington was the first, taken
11th by Cincinnati. Offensive lineman James FitzPatrick
of USC was selected two picks later by San Diego, and
UCLA wide receiver Mike Sherrard was nabbed 18th by
Dallas.
