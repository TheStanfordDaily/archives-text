# Card busts loose vs. Broncs
## Five-run sixth leads Stanford to 8-2 win over Santa Clara 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — The Stanford baseball team
needed to break out.
After suffering through a frustrating weekend
that saw it drop three straight games to USC, the
Cardinal coughed and sputtered through five in
nings yesterday against a clearly inferior Santa
Clara team.
Entering the sixth inning, Stanford was clinging
to a tenuous 2-1 lead. But the Cardinal offense ex
ploded in that frame, putting together four singles,
a triple, a home run and four stolen bases to score
five runs and lock up an 8-2 non-conference victory
over the Broncos here at Buck Shaw Stadium.
The win was the 30th of the year for the No. 14
Cardinal, to go with 18 losses. The team currently
stands in second place in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, tied with Arizona. The Wildcats

come to town this Friday for a crucial three-game
series.
Yesterday's performance bodes well for the
weekend. After a spell of lackluster pitching at
USC, the Cardinal got an excellent outing from
starter Rob Wassenaar. The right-handed junior
scattered six hits over five innings, shutting the
Broncos out through four. In the fifth the Broncos
stroked three singles but could manage only one
run.
"Rob didn't have real good velocity, but he had
good location and he mixed his pitches well, " Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said. "When he had
men on, he got the outs he needed."
Meanwhile, when Stanford was able to get men
on, they usually scored. In the first, third baseman
Ruben Amaro led off with a single, went to second
on first baseman Ron Witmeyer's single and then
came around with the Cardinal's first run on suc
cessive flyouts by catcher John Ramos and
rightfielder Toi Cook.

That was all the Stanford scoring until the fifth,
when leftfielder Walt Harris got aboard on a
fielder's choice, stole second and scored on second
baseman Mark Machtolf s sharp single to left.
Still, the Cardinal was only one run up going into
the sixth. Then the deluge came. Amaro led off the
inning with a long triple into the left-center gap. He
came home on Ramos' single to make the score 3-
1. After Cook singled, centerfielder Mark Davis
poked a perfect hit-and-run single between third
and short to score Ramos and advance Cook to
third. Davis and Cook then ran a double steal, and
when Santa Clara threw down to second base,
Cook came home to put Stanford up 5-1.
By this time, Stanford was beating a dead horse
— namely, Bronco starter Matt McCormick— but
Ed Sprague still hadn't got his licks in. The fresh
man designated hitter got around on a McCormick


Although he has started 36 of Stanford's 48 games this season, fresh
man shortstop Frank Carey wasn't in the lineup yesterday against
Santa Clara. The Cardinal did pretty well without him, however,
defeating the host Broncos 8-2 to bounce back from last weekend's three

losses at USC. The victory, in which the Stanford offense exploded for
five runs in the sixth inning, should give the Cardinal momentum as it
enters this weekend's critical three-game series with Arizona. The
opener will be on Friday at Sunken Diamond.
