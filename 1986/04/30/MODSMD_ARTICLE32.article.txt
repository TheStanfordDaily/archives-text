# Card busts loose vs. Broncs
## Five-run sixth leads Stanford to 8-2 win over Santa Clara 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — The Stanford baseball team
needed to break out.
After suffering through a frustrating weekend
that saw it drop three straight games to USC, the
Cardinal coughed and sputtered through five in
nings yesterday against a clearly inferior Santa
Clara team.
Entering the sixth inning, Stanford was clinging
to a tenuous 2-1 lead. But the Cardinal offense ex
ploded in that frame, putting together four singles,
a triple, a home run and four stolen bases to score
five runs and lock up an 8-2 non-conference victory
over the Broncos here at Buck Shaw Stadium.
The win was the 30th of the year for the No. 14
Cardinal, to go with 18 losses. The team currently
stands in second place in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division, tied with Arizona. The Wildcats

come to town this Friday for a crucial three-game
series.
Yesterday's performance bodes well for the
weekend. After a spell of lackluster pitching at
USC, the Cardinal got an excellent outing from
starter Rob Wassenaar. The right-handed junior
scattered six hits over five innings, shutting the
Broncos out through four. In the fifth the Broncos
stroked three singles but could manage only one
run.
"Rob didn't have real good velocity, but he had
good location and he mixed his pitches well, " Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said. "When he had
men on, he got the outs he needed."
Meanwhile, when Stanford was able to get men
on, they usually scored. In the first, third baseman
Ruben Amaro led off with a single, went to second
on first baseman Ron Witmeyer's single and then
came around with the Cardinal's first run on suc
cessive flyouts by catcher John Ramos and
rightfielder Toi Cook.

That was all the Stanford scoring until the fifth,
when leftfielder Walt Harris got aboard on a
fielder's choice, stole second and scored on second
baseman Mark Machtolf s sharp single to left.
Still, the Cardinal was only one run up going into
the sixth. Then the deluge came. Amaro led off the
inning with a long triple into the left-center gap. He
came home on Ramos' single to make the score 3-
1. After Cook singled, centerfielder Mark Davis
poked a perfect hit-and-run single between third
and short to score Ramos and advance Cook to
third. Davis and Cook then ran a double steal, and
when Santa Clara threw down to second base,
Cook came home to put Stanford up 5-1.
By this time, Stanford was beating a dead horse
— namely, Bronco starter Matt McCormick— but
Ed Sprague still hadn't got his licks in. The fresh
man designated hitter got around on a McCormick


Although he has started 36 of Stanford's 48 games this season, fresh
man shortstop Frank Carey wasn't in the lineup yesterday against
Santa Clara. The Cardinal did pretty well without him, however,
defeating the host Broncos 8-2 to bounce back from last weekend's three

five runs in the sixth inning, should give the Cardinal momentum as it
enters this weekend's critical three-game series with Arizona. The
opener will be on Friday at Sunken Diamond.
fastball and bounced a line-drive two
run home run off the leftfield foul
pole. It was Sprague's third four
bagger of the season and upped the
score to 6-1.
"He (McCormick) was throwing a
lot of breaking pitches, trying to work
us away," said Sprague, "but he
threw that one fastball in on me, and 1
got the barrel on it."
In the Santa Clara half of the sixth,
lefty A 1 Osuna came on in relief of
Wassenaar. He struggled, giving up a
walk and three singles. But when the

Bronco third base coach waved I odd

single to left. Gates was nailed and
Osuna escaped from the inning after
allowing only one run.
Freshman Brian Keysercame on to
muffle the Bronco bats over the final
three frames, cementing the Cardinal
win. The victory went to Wassenaar,
bringing his record to 5-1 on the
season.
After the game, Wassenaar as
sessed the significance of the win.
"It was important for two things,
first, to stop the (losing) streak, and
then to do it the way we did it. . .we
had a big inning, scored a lot of runs

and had a real good job by our hit
ters."
"We pitched well," Marquess said,
"executed hit-and-runs, stole a lot ol
bases and got hits when we had men
in scoring position."
Harris led the Cardinal running at
tack with four stolen bases. Ramos.
Harris, Sprague and Amaro each col
lected two hits. Harris' showing was
an especially welcome sight after he
had managed only three hits in his
previous 26 at-bats.
As the watershed series with
Arizona approaches, the Cardinal
will look to continue yesterday's fine
pitching and opportunistic offensive
production.
