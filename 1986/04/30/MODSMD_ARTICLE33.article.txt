# Stanford softball splits a pair with Santa Clara

### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
It was a somewhat disappointing afternoon for the
Stanford softball team, as the Cardinal came away with
a split in yesterday's double-header against Santa
Clara. The Cardinal was defeated 5-3 in the first game,
but came back in the seventh inning to win the second
game 2-0.
'"We're disappointed," Stanford third baseman
Kathy Dominguez said. "We would like to have won
both games and should have won both games."
The Cardinal pulled out to an early lead in the first
game. Lisa Buchanan drove in two runs in the first in
ning, followed by a run in the third by Margaret Paz
zini. Betsy Watson's pitching didn't yield a single run.
Despite the strong start, the team couldn't hold on to
its lead. "I don't know why," Dominguez said. "We
may have gotten overconfident."
Whatever the reason, the Broncos soon pulled ahead
of the beleaguered Cardinal women and finished the
first game with a 5-3 victory.

Though game two was part of the same double
header, it was a whole different ballgame. Stanford,
determined not to duplicate its recent double-header
loss to UCLA, came out with a good effort and, with
the pitching of Buchanan, kept the game scoreless
through six innings.
In the seventh, however, the Cardinal broke open
the game with two runs. With one runner on, Tish
Peterson got a hit-and-run single, giving Stanford an
excellent opportunity with Dominguez, the Cardinal's
best hitter up next. Dominguez came through and
knocked in both runners.
The Cardinal squad held on to its lead this time and
came away with the 2-0 win.
Despite the second-game win, Dominguez was not
particularly pleased with the squad's performance in
Santa Clara. "We seem to play to the level of the team
we're playing, not above this level," Dominguez said.
She noted the UCLA double-header, where the
Cardinal stayed close but was eventually defeated by
identical 1-0 scores.
