Arabs arrested for British shooting
JERUSALEM — Israeli police yesterday announced the arrest of
Palestinians believed responsible for the slaying of a British visitor Sun
day as well as another murder and the wounding of two foreign tourists
in Arab East Jerusalem.
Because of a court-ordered blackout of the number of the suspects,
their names and other details, police said only that they belonged to a
pro-Syrian dissident Palestinian faction headed by Col. Saeed Musa, also
known as Abu Musa.
In Beirut Monday, however, a communique purportedly from Abu
Nidal, like Abu Musa a bitter foe of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, said his group killed Briton Paul Ap
pleby on Sunday to avenge British cooperation in the recent U.S. raid
against Libya.
Earlier, police officials said the same .22-caliber revolver was used in
the murders of an Israeli businesswoman on April 14 and of Appleby,
outside the Garden Tomb, an East Jerusalem shrine revered by some
Protestants as the site of Christ's burial.
Police said the arrested Palestinians were also believed responsible for
shooting and wounding an American tourist, David Blumenfeld, and a
West German woman within the walled Old City in separate incidents
over the past six weeks.
Atef Abu Bakr, identified as a spokesman for the Abu Nidal terrorist
group, warned on CBS News Monday evening that his group will attack
Americans to avenge the U.S. bombing of Libya. He said that
"America's military and intelligence institutions are our direct
enemies."
Abu Bakr, speaking from Lebanon, named as targets John Singlaub, a
retired U.S. general active in rightist causes; Dr. Edward Luttwak of
Georgetown University, a former consultant to the Defense and State
departments, and Oliver North, an adviser to President Reagan. He also
named the Heritage Foundation.
New Zealand ban could end treaty
WASHINGTON — The State Department repeated yesterday its
warning that the United States will formally suspend its defense commit
ment to New Zealand under the 35-year-old ANZUS treaty if New
Zealand enacts legislation barring nuclear-armed U.S. warships from its
ports.
Officials said they were continuing to seek a way to head off a formal
break in the pact, signed by Australia, New Zealand and the United
States in 1951. But they said the Reagan Administration is standing firm
by its position that New Zealand's proposed nuclear-ship ban would vio
late the treaty.
Last year, the government of Prime Minister David Lange banned
U.S. warships from its ports unless the Navy declared that there were no
nuclear weapons aboard. The United States, arguing that the measure
interfered with its ability to defend the western Pacific, responded by
halting port calls and joint maneuvers.
New Zealand's parliament is expected to pass a law making the ban
permanent in August. At that point. State Department spokesman
Charles Redman warned, "we will review our security obligations to
New Zealand."
"The probable result of such a review would be suspension of our se
curity obligations to New Zealand," he said.
That action would keep the ANZUS treaty alive legally and maintain
U.S. defense ties with Australia, but it would formally end any U.S. obli
gation to defend New Zealand, officials said.
Journalists barred from Indonesia
BALI. Indonesia — The Indonesian government, already under at
tack for human-rights violations, fueled the situation further yesterday
by barring two Australian journalists aboard a White House press
charter from covering President Reagan's visit here.
The journalists were held at the airport and ordered to "transit imme
diately'' in retaliation for an article that appeared in a Sydney newspaper
comparing the wealth amassed by the family of Indonesian President
Suharto to that of deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.
Reagan's plane touched down on this island shortly after the press
charter. He was given a red-carpet welcome by Suharto and will meet
privately with the Indonesian president tomorrow.
Administration officials had hoped that the sensitive question of
human rights would not dominate Reagan's discussions here, but the in
cident with the journalists is likely to bring the issue into sharper focus.
Indonesian authorities also barred Barbara Crossette, a New York
Times correspondent based in Bangkok, Thailand, from covering the
Reagan visit. She was expelled from Indonesia recently after writing ar
ticles that echoed the Marcos comparison and cited human-rights viola
tions. She returned to Bali yesterday but was ordered out once again,
leaving aboard a plane for Singapore without her luggage, according to a
New York Times spokesman.
Unity eludes Filipino government
MANILA, Philippines — With Ferdinand Marcos a distant voice in
Honolulu, the unlikely coalition of politicians, priests, soldiers and
businessmen that engineered his overthrow two months ago is beginning
to show signs of strain.
Many analysts here dismiss them as inevitable growing pains of a new
government. But their appearance raises questions of whether the
group's members can maintain unity in the long run without Marcos
around to force it on them.
In recent weeks, several members of President Corazon Aquino's
Cabinet have sniped repeatedly at each other in public over a range of
policy matters. It has delighted those loyal to Marcos, who maintain that
Aquino lacks the strength to lead a government.
Military men have grumbled over the freeing of top Communist
leaders and suggestions by left-leaning Cabinet members that soldiers
suspected of human rights violations in counterinsurgency operations be
tried, instead of being offered amnesty.
Even friends of Aquino are heard to say these days that the bickering,
to which Manila newspapers are giving prominent play, has damaged her
standing somewhat with parts of the public. However, her ability to gov
ern is generally not seen to have suffered in a major way.
U.S.-Soviet air service resumes
MOSCOW — Direct air service between the Soviet Union and United
States — a legacy of the Geneva summit last November — resumed yes

Pan American World Airways Flight 074, carrying 57 passengers,
landed in Moscow to renew service to the Soviet Union that was halted

An Aeroflot plane from Moscow arrived in Washington, resuming

position of martial law in Poland.
"It's a very important step, and we hope it works," said U.S. Ambas
sador Arthur Hartman, who returned to Moscow on the Pan Am flight
from Frankfurt, West Germany. "They want it to happen, and so do
we.' The welcoming ceremony at Moscow's Shermetyevo Airport went
smoothly without any mention of the recent Soviet-American clash over
the U.S. bombing of Libya or other discordant topics.
"The air bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union is
open." Oleg Srwrnov, deputy minister of civil aviation, told American
passengers on the inaugural Pan Am flight.
"We see the renewal of the flights serving the cause of normalizing
Soviet-American relations," he added.

open." Oleg Srwrnov, deputy minister of civil aviation, told American
passengers on the inaugural Pan Am flight.
"We see the renewal of the flights serving the cause of normalizing
Soviet-American relations," he added.
Arabs arrested for British shooting
JERUSALEM — Israeli police yesterday announced the arrest of
Palestinians believed responsible for the slaying of a British visitor Sun
day as well as another murder and the wounding of two foreign tourists
in Arab East Jerusalem.
Because of a court-ordered blackout of the number of the suspects,
their names and other details, police said only that they belonged to a
pro-Syrian dissident Palestinian faction headed by Col. Saeed Musa, also
known as Abu Musa.
In Beirut Monday, however, a communique purportedly from Abu
Nidal, like Abu Musa a bitter foe of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, said his group killed Briton Paul Ap
pleby on Sunday to avenge British cooperation in the recent U.S. raid
against Libya.
Earlier, police officials said the same .22-caliber revolver was used in
the murders of an Israeli businesswoman on April 14 and of Appleby,
outside the Garden Tomb, an East Jerusalem shrine revered by some
Protestants as the site of Christ's burial.
Police said the arrested Palestinians were also believed responsible for
shooting and wounding an American tourist, David Blumenfeld, and a
West German woman within the walled Old City in separate incidents
over the past six weeks.
Atef Abu Bakr, identified as a spokesman for the Abu Nidal terrorist
group, warned on CBS News Monday evening that his group will attack
Americans to avenge the U.S. bombing of Libya. He said that
"America's military and intelligence institutions are our direct
enemies."
Abu Bakr, speaking from Lebanon, named as targets John Singlaub, a
retired U.S. general active in rightist causes; Dr. Edward Luttwak of
Georgetown University, a former consultant to the Defense and State
departments, and Oliver North, an adviser to President Reagan. He also
named the Heritage Foundation.
New Zealand ban could end treaty
WASHINGTON — The State Department repeated yesterday its
warning that the United States will formally suspend its defense commit
ment to New Zealand under the 35-year-old ANZUS treaty if New
Zealand enacts legislation barring nuclear-armed U.S. warships from its
ports.
Officials said they were continuing to seek a way to head off a formal
break in the pact, signed by Australia, New Zealand and the United
States in 1951. But they said the Reagan Administration is standing firm
by its position that New Zealand's proposed nuclear-ship ban would vio
late the treaty.
Last year, the government of Prime Minister David Lange banned
U.S. warships from its ports unless the Navy declared that there were no
nuclear weapons aboard. The United States, arguing that the measure
interfered with its ability to defend the western Pacific, responded by
halting port calls and joint maneuvers.
New Zealand's parliament is expected to pass a law making the ban
permanent in August. At that point. State Department spokesman
Charles Redman warned, "we will review our security obligations to
New Zealand."
"The probable result of such a review would be suspension of our se
curity obligations to New Zealand," he said.
That action would keep the ANZUS treaty alive legally and maintain
U.S. defense ties with Australia, but it would formally end any U.S. obli
gation to defend New Zealand, officials said.
Journalists barred from Indonesia
BALI. Indonesia — The Indonesian government, already under at
tack for human-rights violations, fueled the situation further yesterday
by barring two Australian journalists aboard a White House press
charter from covering President Reagan's visit here.
The journalists were held at the airport and ordered to "transit imme
diately'' in retaliation for an article that appeared in a Sydney newspaper
comparing the wealth amassed by the family of Indonesian President
Suharto to that of deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.
Reagan's plane touched down on this island shortly after the press
charter. He was given a red-carpet welcome by Suharto and will meet
privately with the Indonesian president tomorrow.
Administration officials had hoped that the sensitive question of
human rights would not dominate Reagan's discussions here, but the in
cident with the journalists is likely to bring the issue into sharper focus.
Indonesian authorities also barred Barbara Crossette, a New York
Times correspondent based in Bangkok, Thailand, from covering the
Reagan visit. She was expelled from Indonesia recently after writing ar
ticles that echoed the Marcos comparison and cited human-rights viola
tions. She returned to Bali yesterday but was ordered out once again,
leaving aboard a plane for Singapore without her luggage, according to a
New York Times spokesman.
Unity eludes Filipino government
MANILA, Philippines — With Ferdinand Marcos a distant voice in
Honolulu, the unlikely coalition of politicians, priests, soldiers and
businessmen that engineered his overthrow two months ago is beginning
to show signs of strain.
Many analysts here dismiss them as inevitable growing pains of a new
government. But their appearance raises questions of whether the
group's members can maintain unity in the long run without Marcos
around to force it on them.
In recent weeks, several members of President Corazon Aquino's
Cabinet have sniped repeatedly at each other in public over a range of
policy matters. It has delighted those loyal to Marcos, who maintain that
Aquino lacks the strength to lead a government.
Military men have grumbled over the freeing of top Communist
leaders and suggestions by left-leaning Cabinet members that soldiers
suspected of human rights violations in counterinsurgency operations be
tried, instead of being offered amnesty.
Even friends of Aquino are heard to say these days that the bickering,
to which Manila newspapers are giving prominent play, has damaged her
standing somewhat with parts of the public. However, her ability to gov
ern is generally not seen to have suffered in a major way.
U.S.-Soviet air service resumes
MOSCOW — Direct air service between the Soviet Union and United
States — a legacy of the Geneva summit last November — resumed yes
terday.
Pan American World Airways Flight 074, carrying 57 passengers,
landed in Moscow to renew service to the Soviet Union that was halted
in 1978 for financial reasons.
An Aeroflot plane from Moscow arrived in Washington, resuming
flights that were stopped by the United States in 1981 to protest the im
position of martial law in Poland.
"It's a very important step, and we hope it works," said U.S. Ambas
sador Arthur Hartman, who returned to Moscow on the Pan Am flight
from Frankfurt, West Germany. "They want it to happen, and so do
we.' The welcoming ceremony at Moscow's Shermetyevo Airport went
smoothly without any mention of the recent Soviet-American clash over
the U.S. bombing of Libya or other discordant topics.
"The air bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union is
open." Oleg Srwrnov, deputy minister of civil aviation, told American
