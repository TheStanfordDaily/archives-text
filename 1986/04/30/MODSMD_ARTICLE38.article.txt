# Poland acts to protect citizens

WARSAW, Poland and WASHINGTON —
The Polish government, acknowledging that fallout
from a damaged Soviet nuclear reactor poses a po
tential hazard to human health, said yesterday that
it would issue medication to children in affected
areas to protect against radioactive iodine.
In an official communique read on the evening
television news, the government said it was also
temporarily restricting the sale of milk to reduce
the possible intake of iodine, a hazardous but
short-lived component of fission wastes.
In addition, the communique warned of the
"absolute necessity" of washing all fresh vegetables
carefully to remove radioactive particles.
These precautionary steps followed daylong
deliberations by a high-level government commis
sion that convened early yesterday, the government
spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said.
Comprised of senior military, health, energy,
agricultural and environmental officials, the com
mission is headed by a deputy premier, Zbignievv
Szalajda.
The government said its commission was in
"constant and direct contact" with Soviet authori
ties and was consulting as well with the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and with
Scandinavian countries, where wind-borne fallout

from the Chernobyl reactor was first detected Sun
day in a broad arc reaching across Denmark,
Sweden, Norway and Finland.
Radiation measurements made by the Polish air
force and ground units yesterday showed a rising
level of radioactive iodine, as of 3 p.m., to levels
that "could be hazardous if maintained for a longer
period of time," the government statement said.
It added that later measurements showed a
"receding trend" in iodine levels and no increase in
other radioactive isotopes from the damaged reac
tor at Chernobyl, 280 miles southeast of the Polish
border in the Soviet Ukraine.
Scandinavian countries, nearly three times this
distance from the accident site, have reported radi
ation levels 3 to 10 times above normal back
ground, an intensity not considered generally
hazardous to health. Polish authorities, however,
have not released any figures for their measure
ments.
Because of its proximity to the Ukraine, Poland
is thought to have leceived a heavier dose of fallout
than the Scandinavian countries, with monitoring
sites in the northeast quarter of the country
showing the highest readings.
Initially, the government said it was here that
anti-radiation tablets would be distributed to

children and infants. But a later statement carried
on Warsaw radio suggested that a broader distribu
tion was planned. The statement said all children
under the age of 6 in Warsaw, a city of 1.5 million,
and the surrounding province would also begin re
ceiving a one-time dose of the medication in kin
dergartens and nursery schools starting Wednesday
morning.
This statement appeared to reflect a shift in
prevailing winds toward the east and south, which
would carry a plume of escaping fission wastes
away from Poland and northern Europe and back
toward the Soviet heartland.
Meanwhile, U.S. experts said yesterday that air
borne particles carried elsewhere are expected to
have minimal global impact.
John Kasper, a spokesman for the Environmen
tal Protection Agency, designated head of a coor
dinated U.S. response to the disaster, said yester
day that the EPA will increase daily radiation mon
itoring at 67 sites, including at least one in each
state.
" During the next few days, it is expected the air
mass will be dispersed by atmospheric activity, but
it is too early to determine whether any portion will
reach the U.S. . . . The important thing to remem
ber is that it won't pose a significant risk," he said.
