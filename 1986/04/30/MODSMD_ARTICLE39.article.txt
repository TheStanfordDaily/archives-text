# U.S. economy takes upswing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The govern
ment's gauge of future business activ
ity rose a healthy 0.5 percent during
March, pointing to an economic
resurgence in the second half of the
year, the Department of Commerce
reported yesterday.
Falling interest rates, declining oil
prices and minimal inflation should
combine to stimulate the economy,
experts believe. A boom already is
under way in housing, and the De
partment of Commerce said sales of
single-family homes set a record last
month.
The index of leading economic in
dicators, compiled from a variety of
measures such as stock prices and
new orders for consumer goods, is

considered a reliable guide to eco
nomic activity during the next several
months.
The March gain of 0.5 percent fol
lowed a substantial increase of 0.9
percent during February. The pace
has accelerated since January, when
the index was unchanged.
"I think what you are seeing is the
economy shifting gears, making the
transition from slow growth to faster
growth," said Leslie Alperstein, pres
ident of Washington Analysis Corp.,
an affiliate of the First Manhattan Co.
brokerage concern. "All logic sug
gests future growth will be faster."
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
expects a surge of growth in the
second half of the year, with the na

tional output of goods and services
expanding at an annual rate of 6 per
cent, far above the first quarter
growth rate of 3.2 percent. "We're
pretty excited about this year," said
Ronald Utt, associate chief econo
mist.
The benefits of falling oil prices will
be felt in the second half of the year,
he noted. "The pains are immediate,"
Utt said, as oil businesses cancel drill
ing plans, stop orders for pipe and
equipment and begin laying off
workers.
But the broader benefits take
longer to work through the economy
as each corporation and household
gets more spending money while en
ergy costs gradually decline.

Another strong stimulus to the eco
nomy is coming from the housing
market, which has "just gone ab
solutely berserk," Utt noted.
Sales of new single-family homes
soared 27.5 percent during March,
hitting an annual rate of 903,000 in
March, the hottest sales pace since
the government began keeping such
records in 1962. Actual sales totaled
87,000 homes, up from 58,000 in the
previous month.
The climb in the leading indicators
"corroborates other signs that the
economy will hand in a better perfor
mance in the second half." said Jerry
Jasinowski, executive vice president
and chief economist of the Ni' .onal
Association of Manufacturers.
