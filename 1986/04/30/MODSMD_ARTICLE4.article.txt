# Pauling lauds deterrence, peace effort
## 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
Last night in Kresge Auditorium, Nobel
laureate Linus Pauling lambasted
politicians who have stirred up anxiety
about nuclear deterrence for reasons other
than promoting world peace, and urged
the audience to do whatever is necessary to
prevent nuclear war.
Pauling is the only person to receive two
unshared Nobel prizes, for chemistry and
peace. He has also received the Gandhi
Peace Prize and the Lenin Peace Prize. He
is a professor emeritus of chemistry here.
Pauling pointed out that only 20 years
passed between World Wars I and 11. add
ing that "if you'd seen the type of anti

communism widespread at the end of the
Second Work! War, you'd have guessed it
would be less than 20 years until Wo.ld
War III."
Pauling credited deterrence for elimin
ating the possibility of war between the
great powers, but added that deterrence
only works as long as the human race
retains its sanity. No one wants to destroy
human civilization or the entire human
race, he said.
But at the same time, the present nu
clear weapon stock piles are unimaginably
huge, Pauling said. He recalled an ad
vertisement that showed a town reduced to
rubble and sported a caption that read,
"This small city destroyed by 500 tons of
dynamite with megaton might." Pauling

admitted that while the designer of the ad
may have been "pretty smart fellows,"
they had still missed the fact that a
megaton is 2,000 times the explosive
power that destroyed that town.
Pauling then pointed out that present
nuclear stockpiles top 60,000 megatons, or
10,000 times the amount of destructive
power unleashed during World War 11.
Since nuclear war obviously doesn't
make sense, why don't we just quit with
what weapons we have and save some
money, Pauling asked.
Pauling said the United States usually
leads the Soviet Union in nuclear arma
ments by about four years. "We blew up a
bomb, they blew up a bomb; we MIRVed
our warheads, thev MIRVed their war

heads: we didn't go to the Olympics, they
didn't go to the Olympics," he said.
Pauling pointed out that the Soviet Un
ion is forced to match our defense spend
ing from a gross national product that is
about half as large as ours, and it therefore
has a good reason to wish to limit the
amount of arms it is forced to build.
Pauling said he believes the United
States has not made a genuine effort to
reduce the present arms buildup because
President Reagan thinks we can spend the
Soviets under the table. He quoted
Reagan's April 1982 National Security
Directive, in which Reagan says the
United States is in a confrontational situa-
