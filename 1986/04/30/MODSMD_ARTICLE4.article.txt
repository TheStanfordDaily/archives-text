# Pauling lauds deterrence, peace effort
## 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
Last night in Kresge Auditorium, Nobel
laureate Linus Pauling lambasted
politicians who have stirred up anxiety
about nuclear deterrence for reasons other
than promoting world peace, and urged
the audience to do whatever is necessary to
prevent nuclear war.
Pauling is the only person to receive two
unshared Nobel prizes, for chemistry and
peace. He has also received the Gandhi
Peace Prize and the Lenin Peace Prize. He
is a professor emeritus of chemistry here.
Pauling pointed out that only 20 years
passed between World Wars I and 11. add
ing that "if you'd seen the type of anti

communism widespread at the end of the
Second Work! War, you'd have guessed it
would be less than 20 years until Wo.ld
War III."
Pauling credited deterrence for elimin
ating the possibility of war between the
great powers, but added that deterrence
only works as long as the human race
retains its sanity. No one wants to destroy
human civilization or the entire human
race, he said.
But at the same time, the present nu
clear weapon stock piles are unimaginably
huge, Pauling said. He recalled an ad
vertisement that showed a town reduced to
rubble and sported a caption that read,
"This small city destroyed by 500 tons of
dynamite with megaton might." Pauling

admitted that while the designer of the ad
may have been "pretty smart fellows,"
they had still missed the fact that a
megaton is 2,000 times the explosive
power that destroyed that town.
Pauling then pointed out that present
nuclear stockpiles top 60,000 megatons, or
10,000 times the amount of destructive
power unleashed during World War 11.
Since nuclear war obviously doesn't
make sense, why don't we just quit with
what weapons we have and save some
money, Pauling asked.
Pauling said the United States usually
leads the Soviet Union in nuclear arma
ments by about four years. "We blew up a
bomb, they blew up a bomb; we MIRVed
our warheads, thev MIRVed their war

heads: we didn't go to the Olympics, they
didn't go to the Olympics," he said.
Pauling pointed out that the Soviet Un
ion is forced to match our defense spend
ing from a gross national product that is
about half as large as ours, and it therefore
has a good reason to wish to limit the
amount of arms it is forced to build.
Pauling said he believes the United
States has not made a genuine effort to
reduce the present arms buildup because
President Reagan thinks we can spend the
Soviets under the table. He quoted
Reagan's April 1982 National Security
Directive, in which Reagan says the
United States is in a confrontational situa-
tion with the Soviet Union and will
make use of all economic and politi
cal advantages to assure U.S. nuclear
superiority and freedom of action
abroad.
Pauling quoted Reagan as saying,
"The Soviets are at their limit. They
have to realize that they cannot
match us."
Pauling wondered why Reagan
continues to insist that the Soviets
have achieved or will soon achieve
nuclear superiority if this is true.
After all, asked Pauling, as a common
joke says, "If they are militarily su
perior, why do you keep insulting
them?"
Pauling referred to an article in
The New York Times that quoted
Sen. Christopher Dodd (R-Conn.)
and former Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-
Mass.) as saying that, according to
conventional wisdom, the president
had lied and continued to do so.
Pauling recalled the case of Presi
dential Spokesman Larry Speakes,
clearing up a mistaken comment
made by Reagan with the remark that

the mistake "doesn't really matter.
Pauling then noted that it might be
too harsh to say that the president has
intentionally deceived the American
people, but rather that Reagan
couldn't tell the difference between
reality and fallacy.
Pauling quoted David Stockman,
former director of the Office of Man
agement and Budget, as saying that
the "fiscal cretinism of the California
mafia has sent this nation on a five
year spending binge which has
doubled the national debt." Much ot
this spending is directly related to the
president's militarism, according to
Pauling. Asked if the president might
be honestly paranoid, Pauling said
that he didn't think so.
"You have to have more mental
capacity to be honestly paranoid," he
said.
Pauling concluded by referring to a
speech he gave at UC-Berkeley in
1957. He said he counseled a student
there to do his schoolwork, and not to
become actively involved in the peace
movement.
Pauling said that he does not give
that advice any more, since the stakes
have become too high.
