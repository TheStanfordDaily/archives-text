Tax reform may pass
WASHINGTON — Chances that the Senate
Finance Committee will produce a tax-revision
bill improved yesterday as senators reacted
positively to yet another set of new proposals by
chairman Bob Packwood (R-Ore.)
Packwood laid out tax-package options that
would cut the top personal-tax rate to either 26
percent or 27 percent, and the committee
tentatively agreed in a private meeting to
measures that would raise corporate taxes by as
much as $60 billion to help pay for lower individ
ual rates.
More corporate tax increases will be necessary
to fully offset the tax revenue lost from lower in
dividual rates, and no x/ otes on any of the
proposals have been taken.
The new options would retain some popular
individual-tax deductions, such as those for
mortgage interest, charitable contributions and
state and local income taxes.
The option with a 26 percent top rate,
however, does away with the deduction for state
and local sales and personal-property taxes. Both
options would end other widely used deductions,
such as the one for Individual Retirement Ac
counts.
Senators said that although the specifics have
yet to be decided for both corporations and indi
viduals, the committee has regained momentum.
The outlook, they said, is significantly brighter
than it was a week and a half ago, when Pack
wood suspended voting because amendments
were bleeding the bill of revenue.
Chances the panel will produce a bill "have
gone from zero to 50-50," said Sen. Lloyd

Bentsen (D-Texas.) "It is back on track, but
there is surely no full head of steam."
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.), who Monday said tax revision was
"hanging by a thread," said yesterday that it is
now "hanging by a rope."
Court expands evidence
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled
yesterday that convicted murderers seeking to
avoid the death penalty must be allowed to pres
ent evidence that they exhibited good behavior
while in jail awaiting trial after the crime.
By unanimous vote, the justices overturned the
capital sentence of a South Carolina defendant
who had been prevented from offering favorable
testimony from his jailers in a bid to show that he
would behave himself in prison if his life were
spared.
The court, extending the scope of previous
rulings on the issue, said that the defendant in the
case had been improperly denied an opportunity
to present all the "mitigating evidence" he could
to escape capital punishment.
Earlier decisions have required the admission
of any "relevant" aspect of a defendant's charac
ter and record and the circumstances of the crime
as mitigating evidence in his behalf. But it was
not clear that the requirement applied to conduct
after a crime.
Justice Byron White, writing for the court yes
terday, declared: "A defendant's disposition to
make a well-behaved and peaceful adjustment to
life in prison is itself an aspect of his character
that is by its nature relevant to the sentencing de

termination."
But three justices, while agreeing that the sen
tence in this case should be set aside, said the
court's broadly worded ruling went too far in re
quiring the admission of evidence of behavior
after a crime has been committed.
Methodists oppose SDI
MORRISTOWN, N.J. — The Council of Bis
hops of the United Methodist Church, spiritual
leaders of the nation's second largest Protestant
denomination, yesterday denounced any use of
nuclear weapons and the Reagan Administra
tion's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as "Star Wars."
In a pastoral letter addressed to 9.2 million
members of the church in the United States and
15 other countries, the bishops rejected the
doctrine of nuclear deterrence, the linchpin of
the United States' modern military policy, as "a
position which cannot receive the church's bless
ing."
"We have stated our complete lack of confi
dence in proposed 'defenses' against nuclear at
tack and are convinced that the enormous cost of
developing such defenses is one more witness to
the obvious fact that the arms race is a social
justice issue, not only a war-and-peace issue,"
said the letter adopted unanimously by the coun
cil.
"U.S. arms are now being purchased with food
stamps, welfare checks, rent subsidies, Medicaid
payments, school lunches and nutrition supple
ments for poor mothers and their children," the
document states.

of any "relevant" aspect of a defendant's charac
ter and record and the circumstances of the crime
as mitigating evidence in his behalf. But it was
not clear that the requirement applied to conduct
after a crime.
Justice Byron White, writing for the court yes
terday, declared: "A defendant's disposition to
make a well-behaved and peaceful adjustment to
life in prison is itself an aspect of his character
that is by its nature relevant to the sentencing de

termination."
But three justices, while agreeing that the sen
tence in this case should be set aside, said the
court's broadly worded ruling went too far in re
quiring the admission of evidence of behavior
after a crime has been committed.
Methodists oppose SDI
MORRISTOWN, N.J. — The Council of Bis
hops of the United Methodist Church, spiritual
leaders of the nation's second largest Protestant
denomination, yesterday denounced any use of
nuclear weapons and the Reagan Administra
tion's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as "Star Wars."
In a pastoral letter addressed to 9.2 million
members of the church in the United States and
15 other countries, the bishops rejected the
doctrine of nuclear deterrence, the linchpin of
the United States' modern military policy, as "a
position which cannot receive the church's bless
ing."
"We have stated our complete lack of confi
dence in proposed 'defenses' against nuclear at
tack and are convinced that the enormous cost of
developing such defenses is one more witness to
the obvious fact that the arms race is a social
justice issue, not only a war-and-peace issue,"
said the letter adopted unanimously by the coun
cil.
"U.S. arms are now being purchased with food
stamps, welfare checks, rent subsidies, Medicaid
payments, school lunches and nutrition supple
ments for poor mothers and their children," the
document states.
