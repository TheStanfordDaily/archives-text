LA library catches fire
LOS ANGELES — A fire erupted in the
stacks of the 60-year-old downtown library yes
terday, destroying rare books, forcing evacuation
of the building and injuring at least 14
firefighters.
Flames started in the sixth tier of the three
story buildings eight-tier central book stacks,
long a concern of fire-prevention officers, shortly
before 11 a.m. and pushed their way into the at
tic. Tier six corresponds with the second floor.
Smoke billowed from the mosaic-covered
pyramid tower.
The third floor partially collapsed about 1 p.m.
and the fire continued to burn out of control yes
terday afternoon. Firefighters slammed
sledgehammers against the windows to release
intense heat.
"Books were burning from the floor to the
ceiling," firefighter Ron Matsuosaid.
Fire Capt. Tony DiDomenico said the fire
moved east to west, destroying parts of two floors
of books.
The cause of the fire was not immediately
known, city fire Inspector Ed Reed said. There
were no reported injuries to the public or
employees.

Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, who went to the
scene, said the library would probably have to be
rebuilt. Mayor Tom Bradley cut short a trip to
San Diego and was returning to survey the
damage.
"Until we get in there and find out what it is
that's been damaged, we can't really tell," said li
brary spokesman Bob Reagan. "But the poten
tial is that one of the great libraries of the free
world has been seriously damaged."
Marilyn Johnson, director of library branches,
said every department in the central library had
some rare items.
Walker testifies in trial
SAN FRANCISCO — Confessed spymaster
John Walker testified yesterday his Soviet con
tacts were alarmed to learn he had recruited his
Navy friend, Jerry Whitworth, into his espionage
operation in 1974, but later expressed satisfac
tion with the secret documents Whitworth pro
vided.
Walker also identified several documents as
evidence of Whitworth's involvement — includ
ing an allegedly coded reference to spying in a

letter about scuba diving — but did not say
whether he ever told Whitworth the secrets were
being sold to the Soviet Union.
Speaking in a monotone, the bearded 48-year
old witness proceeded through a second day of
testimony that, if believed by a federal court jury,
could send his former friend and Navy colleague
to prison for life.
Whitworth, 46, of Davis, is accused of selling
information on sensitive Navy code and commu
nications systems for $332,000 to Walker for
transmission to the Soviet Union. Seven of the 13
charges against him are espionage counts that
carry potential life sentences.
Walker pleaded guilty to three espionage
related charges in a Baltimore federal court last
October and agreed to testify against Whitworth
in exchange for a reduced sentence for Walker's
son, Michael, who also pleaded guilty. Walker's
brother, Arthur, was convicted of spying by a
federal judge.
