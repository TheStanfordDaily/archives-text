# Students to talk to trustee group
## Divestment to be discussed 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
The University's Board of Trustees
has invited student representatives to
address the issue of divestment at a
special committee meeting May 12,
but Dean of Student Affairs lames
Lyons predicted last night that no
major change would occur in Stan
ford's policy toward its South Africa
related holdings.
In an April 29 letter to Carey
White, ASSU Senate Chair and
member-elect of the Council of Presi
dents, Lyons stated that "a consider
able block of time" had been set aside
for senior Paula Groves and "one or
two" other students to speak before
the Trustee Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (S-CIR).
Groves, currently a student repre
sentative to the board's Investment
Committee, could not be reached for
comment.
The letter was in response to
demands last week from White and
other student activists that the trus
tees agree to publicly discuss total di
vestment at the May 12 meeting and
release a "definitive policy" on the
issue. The demands were issued fol
lowing a two-thirds majority vote on
an ASSU divestment referendum
earlier this month.

"President Kennedy has asked me
to respond to your recent letter to
him asking that the issue of total di
vestment be placed on the next
agenda of the Board of Trustees. You
may not have been aware that. . . the
issue of divestment has already been
scheduled for discussion," Lyons wrote.
In response to the demand that the
May 12 meeting be made public,
Lyons said in the letter that "this
would be inconsistent with the long
established policy of the Board of
Trustees that its meetings be closed.
However, there are faculty and stu
dent representatives on all standing
committees of the board."
Lyons said last night that he
"doesn't see the board moving
toward a (total) divestment policy."
but added that "they might put more
teeth into Stanford's existing policy of
selective divestment."
White said last night that the trus
tees' divestment policy "will need a
whole mouthful of teeth" to satisfy
student demands.
"The policy (the trustees) currently
have will not lead in the direction the
students want." White said.
"However. I'm happy they're taking
it up."
The trustees' current policy of
closed meetings is "unfortunate."
White said.
