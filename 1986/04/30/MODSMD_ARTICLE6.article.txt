# Queen Bee leaves hive
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
At peak times of the year, the Stanford Admis
sions Office is like a beehive buzzing with activity.
Swarms of people, paperwork and phone calls fly in
and out of the office.
For the last six years, Bamah Vaughn has been
the queen bee of the admissions hive, overseeing

F 031 yf 0

and orchestrating much of the office's activity.
Vaughn has served as Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter's personal secretary and supervisor of the
Admissions Office secretarial pool for the past two
years. For four years before that, she was Dean
Fred Hargadon's personal secretary.
Vaughn retires today, leaving behind a legacy of
impeccable efficiency and good-humored diligence.
Above all, this quiet, polite woman leaves behind
an Admissions staff that will miss her dearly.
"She's very much loved," says Fetter of her sec
retary. "She'll be sorely missed."
Indeed, Admissions staffers past and present
speak glowingly of Vaughn's seemingly inestimable
value to the office.
"Without Bamah here. 1 don't know what we'd
do," says Assoc. Director of Admissions Marie
Mookini. "She pretty much holds down the fort."
In fact, Vaughn was so busy holding down the
fort that she didn't have time to interview for this
article. But her co-workers have plenty to say
about her.
"She kept the office afloat," recalls former asso
ciate director Keith Light. "When the rest of us
were at the end of our collective ropes, Bamah
would be as polite as can be, and she'd know when
not to bother us."
"She takes such a lot of abuse on the phone for
me as a protector, and she does it with such
equanimity," says Fetter.
Hargadon, now a senior vice president of the
College Board, has similar recollectioas.
"Everybody talks about admissions officers
being gatekeepers," says Hargadon, "but Bamah
was the real gatekeeper. I'm sure she saved my life
many times.
"I can remember when parents would call de
manding to talk to the dean, and they would say to
Bamah, 'I'm a very busy man,' and through the
door 1 could hear her reply 'Well, he's a very busy
man, too.'
" Remember how we used to have the one adjec
tive question on the applications? Well, one word
that comes to mind to describe Bamah is
equanimity' .. . poise under pressure."
But there's more to Vaughn than just impertur
bable clerical excellence, and that's why the Ad
missions staff is particularly fond of her.
"Bamah has this unexpected dry sense of
humor," says Fetter. " 'Equanimity' actually misses
something, because that's superimposed with this

super dry wit."
"She looks formidable, but behind that she's a
person who just loves a joke," says Credentials Su
pervisor Anne Vosti.
"Once you get her going, she's hysterical," says
Deneece Glenn, a receptionist in the Admissions
office. "It's so out of character for her to be silly."
Her co-workers have given Vaughn plenty of op
portunity to be silly, and they remember a few inci
dents in particular.
" A few years ago, a local radio station — I think
it was KYUU — was having a special program for
National Secretary's Week," says Light. "We
called in and nominated her, and she was named
'Secretary of the Half-Hour.' The station called her
on the air, and she got on there and told the whole
Bay Area how she really ran the place."
"Bamah has a great sense of humor," says Har
gadon. "I used to joke with her .. . she always had
to tell people that I couldn't come to the phone be
cause I was busy reading or busy talking to some
one or busy at a meeting. ... I used to try to get her
to say that I was 'just busy thinking.' But I don't
think she ever did that.
"We pulled a lot of practical jokes, and you just
knew that she'd roll with it."
"She'll go along with just about anything as long
as it's in good taste," says Bunnell. "She doesn't
take herself too seriously."
Although Glenn says that "everybody always
thinks Bamah's from Alabama because of her
name," Vaughn was actually born in Oklahoma,
where she grew up and lived until World War 11,

according to her daughter Patti. After the war, she
joined the Army, coming out West to serve as a
sergeant (some say drill sergeant, other supply ser
geant) in San Francisco for three or four years.
She married her husband, Robert, in 1951 and
settled down to raise her four children. As a
mother, according to her daughter, Vaughn was
"very disciplined, yes, but not real organized . , .
with four kids, you know. , .
Eventually, Vaughn wanted "to get out of the
house, get away from the kids," her daughter says,
so she went back to work. She held a couple jobs
before ending up at Stanford in September 1979.
After ht r retirement, Vaughn plans to travel, ac
cording to her daughter, and do some volunteer
and temporary work as well. Her first post
retirement trip will be to the Grand Canyon with
her husband.
But no matter how far Vaughn ventures away
from the Stanford Admissions Office in her travels,
there will always be a place for her in the hearts of
her fellow workers.
"You're just lucky when you have somebody like
Bamah," says Hargadon.
Bunnell echoes those words:
"Bamah really is someone who is so much a part
of the office that the full impact of her leaving will
only be felt when we realize just how many things
she does on a day-to-day basis that we take for
granted.
"She's a great worker who just goes about her
job quietly and without much fanfare, but she has
added so much to the office."

me as a protector, and she does it with such
equanimity," says Fetter.
Hargadon, now a senior vice president of the
College Board, has similar recollectioas.
"Everybody talks about admissions officers
being gatekeepers," says Hargadon, "but Bamah
was the real gatekeeper. I'm sure she saved my life
many times.
"I can remember when parents would call de
manding to talk to the dean, and they would say to
Bamah, 'I'm a very busy man,' and through the
door 1 could hear her reply 'Well, he's a very busy
man, too.'
" Remember how we used to have the one adjec
tive question on the applications? Well, one word
that comes to mind to describe Bamah is
equanimity' .. . poise under pressure."
But there's more to Vaughn than just impertur
bable clerical excellence, and that's why the Ad
missions staff is particularly fond of her.
"Bamah has this unexpected dry sense of
humor," says Fetter. " 'Equanimity' actually misses
something, because that's superimposed with this

super dry wit."
"She looks formidable, but behind that she's a
person who just loves a joke," says Credentials Su
pervisor Anne Vosti.
"Once you get her going, she's hysterical," says
Deneece Glenn, a receptionist in the Admissions
office. "It's so out of character for her to be silly."
Her co-workers have given Vaughn plenty of op
portunity to be silly, and they remember a few inci
dents in particular.
" A few years ago, a local radio station — I think
it was KYUU — was having a special program for
National Secretary's Week," says Light. "We
called in and nominated her, and she was named
'Secretary of the Half-Hour.' The station called her
on the air, and she got on there and told the whole
Bay Area how she really ran the place."
"Bamah has a great sense of humor," says Har
gadon. "I used to joke with her .. . she always had
to tell people that I couldn't come to the phone be
cause I was busy reading or busy talking to some
one or busy at a meeting. ... I used to try to get her
to say that I was 'just busy thinking.' But I don't
think she ever did that.
"We pulled a lot of practical jokes, and you just
knew that she'd roll with it."
"She'll go along with just about anything as long
as it's in good taste," says Bunnell. "She doesn't
take herself too seriously."
Although Glenn says that "everybody always
thinks Bamah's from Alabama because of her
name," Vaughn was actually born in Oklahoma,
where she grew up and lived until World War 11,

according to her daughter Patti. After the war, she
joined the Army, coming out West to serve as a
sergeant (some say drill sergeant, other supply ser
geant) in San Francisco for three or four years.
She married her husband, Robert, in 1951 and
settled down to raise her four children. As a
mother, according to her daughter, Vaughn was
"very disciplined, yes, but not real organized . , .
with four kids, you know. , .
Eventually, Vaughn wanted "to get out of the
house, get away from the kids," her daughter says,
so she went back to work. She held a couple jobs
before ending up at Stanford in September 1979.
After ht r retirement, Vaughn plans to travel, ac
cording to her daughter, and do some volunteer
and temporary work as well. Her first post
retirement trip will be to the Grand Canyon with
her husband.
But no matter how far Vaughn ventures away
from the Stanford Admissions Office in her travels,
there will always be a place for her in the hearts of
her fellow workers.
"You're just lucky when you have somebody like
Bamah," says Hargadon.
Bunnell echoes those words:
"Bamah really is someone who is so much a part
of the office that the full impact of her leaving will
only be felt when we realize just how many things
she does on a day-to-day basis that we take for
granted.
"She's a great worker who just goes about her
job quietly and without much fanfare, but she has
added so much to the office."

Bamah Vaughn, who has been a secretary in the Admissions Office for
six years, retires today.
At peak times of the year, the Stanford Admis
sions Office is like a beehive buzzing with activity.
Swarms of people, paperwork and phone calls fly in
and out of the office.
For the last six years, Bamah Vaughn has been
the queen bee of the admissions hive, overseeing

F 031 yf 0

and orchestrating much of the office's activity.
Vaughn has served as Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter's personal secretary and supervisor of the
Admissions Office secretarial pool for the past two
years. For four years before that, she was Dean
Fred Hargadon's personal secretary.
Vaughn retires today, leaving behind a legacy of
impeccable efficiency and good-humored diligence.
Above all, this quiet, polite woman leaves behind
an Admissions staff that will miss her dearly.
"She's very much loved," says Fetter of her sec
retary. "She'll be sorely missed."
Indeed, Admissions staffers past and present
speak glowingly of Vaughn's seemingly inestimable
value to the office.
"Without Bamah here. 1 don't know what we'd
do," says Assoc. Director of Admissions Marie
Mookini. "She pretty much holds down the fort."
In fact, Vaughn was so busy holding down the
fort that she didn't have time to interview for this
article. But her co-workers have plenty to say
about her.
"She kept the office afloat," recalls former asso
ciate director Keith Light. "When the rest of us
were at the end of our collective ropes, Bamah
would be as polite as can be, and she'd know when
not to bother us."
"She takes such a lot of abuse on the phone for
me as a protector, and she does it with such
equanimity," says Fetter.
Hargadon, now a senior vice president of the
College Board, has similar recollectioas.
