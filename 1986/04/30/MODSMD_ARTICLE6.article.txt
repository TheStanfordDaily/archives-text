# Queen Bee leaves hive

### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
At peak times of the year, the Stanford Admis
sions Office is like a beehive buzzing with activity.
Swarms of people, paperwork and phone calls fly in
and out of the office.
For the last six years, Bamah Vaughn has been
the queen bee of the admissions hive, overseeing

and orchestrating much of the office's activity.
Vaughn has served as Dean of Admissions Jean
Fetter's personal secretary and supervisor of the
Admissions Office secretarial pool for the past two
years. For four years before that, she was Dean
Fred Hargadon's personal secretary.
Vaughn retires today, leaving behind a legacy of
impeccable efficiency and good-humored diligence.
Above all, this quiet, polite woman leaves behind
an Admissions staff that will miss her dearly.
"She's very much loved," says Fetter of her sec
retary. "She'll be sorely missed."
Indeed, Admissions staffers past and present
speak glowingly of Vaughn's seemingly inestimable
value to the office.
"Without Bamah here. 1 don't know what we'd
do," says Assoc. Director of Admissions Marie
Mookini. "She pretty much holds down the fort."
In fact, Vaughn was so busy holding down the
fort that she didn't have time to interview for this
article. But her co-workers have plenty to say
about her.
