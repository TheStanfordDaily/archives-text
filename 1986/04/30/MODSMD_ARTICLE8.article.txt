# Hoover receives Flory papers

### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
The wife of the late Paul Flory, chemistry professor
emeritus at Stanford and a Nobel laureate, has donated
his personal collection of papers publicizing the plight
of dissident Soviet scientists to the Hoover Institution
archives.
Emily Flory made the donation last December, and
the papers are open to all researchers.
"The papers cover the period from 1976 to 1985 and
consist of correspondence, statements, memoranda,
bulletins, press releases and clippings," according to
Elena Danielson, assistant archivist at Hoover.
The papers monitor the conditions under which
dissidents are forced to live, and much of the material
documents the specific cases of Soviet dissidents
Andrei Sakharov, Yuri Orlov and Anatoly
Shcharansky, Danielson said.
"The interesting thing about the collection is that we
received it in 1985, and just in 1986 (five months after
Flory's death) Shcharansky was able to secure release
to the West," Danielson said.
"While there is no direct correlation, we can surmise
that the kind of work Paul Flory did influenced the
climate of opinion which contributed to Shcharansky's

release." she said.
According to Danielson, "One thing Flory was able
to do besides influencing the political climate was to
help secure a visa for Yelena Bonner, Sakharov's wife,
to come to the West for medical treatment." Flory of
fered himself to the Soviet Union as a hostage to guar
antee Bonner's good behavior.
Flory won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1974 and
"used the fame and public recognition that came with
winning the prize to get exposure for his human rights
campaign," Danielson said.
"Flory would dash off letters to heads of state" in
support of persecuted colleagues, especially in Eastern
Europe. He also supported colleagues in Central
America and Africa, Danielson said.
One document in the collection, a letter Flory wrote
in 1978 to Anatoly Alexandrov, president of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, expresses the outrage at charges
brought against Soviet scientists that was the basis of
Flory's campaign, Danielson said.
"You are no doubt aware of the widespread revul
sion generated in the United States and other Western
countries by the bizarre charges brought against Yuri
Orlov, Anatoly Shcharansky and Alexander
Ginsburg," Flory's letter states.
