## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Monitor animal rights 
### 
From the time we pith and dissect our first frog in
grade school, we are taught that any use of animals —
however inhumane — is justified as long as it is in the
name of scientific understanding. People who believe
animals have the right not to be mutilated or killed —
even if for research that is for very valuable purposes
— have traditionally been overlooked and regarded as
mere kooks who obstruct the noble efforts of scientists
looking for a cure for some deadly disease.
While it is clear animal research is an unfortunate
necessity in the quest to improve biological under
standing and eliminate disease, it is equally evident
that there needs to be more stringent control over
animal experimentation and more input from those
concerned with animal welfare.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) maintains
guidelines for animal use and is responsible for grant
ing accreditation to research institutions. Yet, prob
lems persist. In the past year, experimentation at Co
lumbia University and the University of Pennsylvania
has been halted because of unnecessarily cruel re
search. Stanford recently regained the accreditation it
lost in 1982.
Like many similar institutions, Stanford maintains its
own board to review case-by-case and approve re
search proposals that include work with animals.
However, the board hardly represents the many views
on the subject. It is appointed by the University —

which has a vested interest in keeping federal grant
money flowing — and consists almost exclusively of re
searchers and other scientists. The voting members
are: five faculty members who work with animals regu
larly, the director of the Research Animal Facility, two
veterinarians, a Ph.D. biologist, a student and two
others who are currently the chaplain of the medical
school and a law professor.
This panel is conspicuously lacking the voice of con
cern for the animals, a voice which has a legitimate
place when decisions are being made that could mean
life or death for countless experimental subjects. One
need not be a scientist to notice when an animal is suf
fering and say that an experiment must not continue.
For too long, the researchers have made all the deci
sions, discounted arguments that have only an ethical
basis and rejected criticism by speaking of developing
cures for human diseases.
Knowledgeable and reasonable animal rights activists
abound, and the University need only open its doors
and invite one to help in decision making that is often
blinded by desire to make progress at any cost.
The presence of a voice — or better yet voices —
that would consistently search for alternatives, pres
sure scientists to justify experimentation and recognize
animal suffering as an unacceptable part of animal
work has an important place if Stanford is to be consid
ered one of the world's most humane and ethical, as
well as productive and innovative research institutions.
