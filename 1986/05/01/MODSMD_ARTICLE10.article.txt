# Holocaust survivor speaks at Cardenal

### CHRISTOPHER DOYLE 
"1 owe my survival to my father, and a
long string of luck and coincidences," said
Dr. M. Michael Thaler, a survivor of the
Holocaust and professor of pediatrics at the
University of San Francisco Medical School.
"My father told me, 'Whatever the Ger
mans want you to do, it cannot be good for
you, so resist in any way.' Not many made it
— it's a matter of luck, of not being seen. It's
a matter of the weather, of finding shelter, of
not getting typhus."
Thaler, who is the president of the
Holocaust Library and Research Center in
San Francisco, spoke to an audience of 20 in
Cardenal lounge last night about the trials he
and his parents underwent in avoiding and
escaping from the Germans.
Thaler, who was five years old when
World War II broke out, said he was lucky
he was a child. "Children don't relate to
death as fear of the unknown," he said.
"You did what you did to survive. You lived
day to day. There often wasn't the luxury to
feel fear."
Thaler said there were times, however,
when he was terrified of losing his mother
since his father was gone. His father had

been deported to a work camp from which
he escaped and is the sole survivor.
Thaler discussed the general experiences
of many East European Jews and said he was
hesitant to dwell on personal details because
they may be off the point. He added that it is
important not to forget the issues the
Holocaust raises, and that personal stories
can be merely entertaining.
Thaler was born and raised in Eastern
Poland and spent much time with his parents
in a ghetto. He spent eight months when he
was five living with a non-Jewish Polish
couple during which he learned to read, since
he could not go out.
Due to the danger to which he was sub
jecting the couple, Thaler returned to his
parents in the ghetto. His father was
deported to a lesser-known work camp from
which he escaped after working on road
crews for six months. The sole survivor of
that camp, he was reunited with his family
who had since escaped from the ghetto.
Thaler said that even though it was the
beginning of the end for the Germans, they
were intent on eliminating the Jews. Thaler
said, "They decided to at least exterminate
the Jews — that would be their great contri
bution to the world."
