A Meyer Library exhibit of documents and visual dis
plays relating to the history of the acquired immune
deficiency (AIDS) epidemic was vandalized sometime
before 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, according to a representative
of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS).
AIDS Research Coordinator Gerard Koskovich said he
discovered a "slimy" substance dripping from the ex
hibit's glass encasement.
"It's been up for two weeks with no problems," Kos
kovich said, adding that he and another GLAS member
immediately cleaned the display. However, Meyer Li
brary Exhibit Coordinator Julie Cain said she was un
aware of the act.
"There haven't been any problems. There have been
plenty of people looking at it, but that's as far as it's
gone," Cain said.
GLAS member Ken Ruebush said the AIDS exhibit
was "extremely important" to all members of the Stan
ford community.
The AIDS exhibit, which completes its two-week dis
play today, focuses on the response to the epidemic by the
Office of Residential Education, Cowell Student Health
Center, the Stanford University Medical Center and
GLAS.
