The nuclear disaster at Chernobyl has given the
world a glimpse of the unthinkable. Although the full
extent of last week's reactor accident in the Soviet U
kraine is not yet known, the massive cloud of radioactive
fallout spreading over Western Europe this week indi
cates that a nuclear disaster of perhaps unprecedented
magnitude has occurred.
In the wake of this tragedy. Western nations have at
tacked the Soviet Union for its mysterious slowness in
informing the West of the terrible mishap erupting in
its heartland. The European Community commissioner
for nuclear safety declared, for example, that the
Soviets' silence may have been a violation of interna
tional law. And yesterday, The Wall Street Journal, ec
hoing many Western critics, blamed the disaster in part
on a Soviet policy of "not putting the same value on ci
vilian lives ... as does the democratic West."
Such political criticism may be valid, but it tragically

obscures the human dimension of the Chernobyl dis
aster.
Just as fallout knows no borders, human misery
knows no politics. It is imperative that we in the West
put aside, at least temporarily, our feud with the East
and offer the Soviets every assistance in alleviating the
effects of this disaster. A spontaneous gesture of
American compassion would go a long way toward
easing tension and building mutual trust between the
peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union.
Most immediately, however, sending American
food, medicine and technical assistance to the Soviet
Union would greatly help the many people injured or
made homeless by the Chernobyl disaster. If a nuclear
accident such as this one had occured in a "friendly"
nation such as Britain, American aid would almost cer
tainly have been immediate and massive. Why not of
fer Soviet citizens the same goodwill?
