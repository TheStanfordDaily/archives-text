## Affirmative action myths 
### 
Loren Borud's letter to the editor (Daily, April 28)
dealt with the perceived notion that affirmative action,
while well-intended, promotes racism in the form of
reverse discrimination. His observations and hypothetical
situations lend strong credence to his argument, but I feel
they are somewhat flawed and 1 would like to offer a few
facts and thoughts so that a more realistic discussion can
take place. The data I am using comes from the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges and represents the
medical school class entering in 1983-84.
Myth No. /: "Special provisions for minority students
put majority students at a disadvantage." Borud men
tioned "special encouragements," special grants, assis
tance from affirmative action coordinators, etc. You may
ask why so-called "special encouragements" should be

made toward minority students. Consider this — in 1983,
35,200 students applied to medical school in the United
States. Of this amount, 2,558 (7.3 percent) were black
and 507 (1.4 percent) were Mexican-American/Chicano
. . . not exactly a stampede of minority students trying to
get into medical school.
As you can see from these numbers, minorities are
under-represented even in the applicant pool. What could
be the cause of this? Maybe minorities make up a small
subset of undergraduates who get their bachelor degrees
. . . okay, I could buy that. Or maybe minority students
are not as smart as majority students (i.e. smaller GPAs
and MCAT scores), and realizing this they don't even
bother to apply. ... I think the only one who could truly
accept this statement would be William Shockley. Or how
about this . . . minority students are convinced by cultural
standards and societal images that they can't get into
medical school, or maybe they have more pressing matters
(such as entering the work force to help support their fam
ily) — maybe these factors are actually involved to some
degree.
I think this may be true in a large number of cases.
"Special encouragements" should be used to try to dispel
some of the mystery surrounding medical school admis
sions, while providing information on such items as need
based grants and fellowships for minority students. These
provisions are not meant to increase the acceptance rate of
minority students, only to increase the applicant pool and
thereby increase the number of minority students ac
cepted.
Myth No. 2: "White males are punished via affirmative
action programs." In 1983, of the 16,480 people admitted
to medical school, 13,563 (82.3 percent) were white.
Under-represented minorities (blacks, native Americans
Alaskan natives, Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans)
made up only 1,399 new entrants. (The balance being
made up by Asian-Americans, foreign students and
"others"). If you look at the numbers, you can see that the
chance of getting admitted to medical school for anyone
(white, black, brown. . . .) is around 47 percent. Looking
at individual groups, the chances (within one percentage
point) are: whites, 50 percent; blacks, 40 percent;
Hispanics, 51 percent.
Now, if you make the inference that whites, on the
average, are more qualified to enter medical school than

minorities, then you could make a case for reverse dis
crimination. The key point is, are whites statistically more
qualified than their minority counterparts?
I don't think this is the case. I find it hard to believe that
when I was applying to medical school, my 50 percent
chance was hampering some white male's 50 percent
chance more than another white male's 50 percent
chance. Hey Loren, chill out. You are more likely to be
bumped from an acceptance list by a white applicant than
by a minority applicant.
Myth No. 3: "Qualified white males are unfairly passed
up in favor of minority students." I hope from Myth No. 2
you can start seeing cracks in this theory, but let's think
about what Borud is implying. If a highly qualified white
male is rejected from a medical school, does this imply
discrimination if minority students were accepted to the
same school? Well, maybe, if the minority students that
were accepted were less qualified and if no majority stu
dents were accepted who were also less qualified. This may
come as a surprise to you, Loren, but minority students
who are accepted to medical schools don't necessarily
make up the bottom of the barrel, a mere addendum to
the class roster. There are more minority students than
you think who are more qualified than their fellow stu
dents, based on GPA, MCAT scores, etc.
Which brings up the next point, the measurement of
qualifications. Admission officers are faced with the task
of deciding who amongst the applicant pool will make
good doctors. Given the hypothetical case Borud presents
(the qualified majority student being rejected in favor of
the equally qualified minority student), it seems only
reasonable that the admissions committee consider such
things as the number of hours that the student had to work
in order to attend school, or the environment from which
they came . . . items which cannot be reasonably quan
tified but which should be considered. Until the day all
candidates come from identical backgrounds, admissions
officers will have to consider these points.
So, what does this all mean? 1 feel that the affirmative
action program, while flawed in some respects, is needed.
People who feel that minorities would still get treated
fairly without the program must believe that societ\ is
willing to change its ideas without a struggle. For all
female, white pre-meds who believe this, I recommend
you corner a third- or fourth-year female medical student
in the student lounge someday, and ask her what it feels
like to be mistaken for a nurse, or to have a patient re
quest a male doctor, or to be called "dear" or "sweetie"
by a male attending physician. Then take Borud's letter,
maybe predate it by 30 or 40 years, and substitute
"female" wherever you see "minority student." Change
does not occur overnight, but this is the first step.
Finally, I'll leave you with an excerpt from a letter
which appeared anonymously in the Feb. 14 edition of
"The Organ," the medical student magazine.
"How would you feel if. . . when you mention to an ad
ministrator that you got the third highest score in a diffi
cult course, there is a look of absolute shock that you per
formed not just as well as, but actually better than, your
'peers.' I know how it feels."

maybe predate it by 30 or 40 years, and substitute
"female" wherever you see "minority student." Change
does not occur overnight, but this is the first step.
Finally, I'll leave you with an excerpt from a letter
which appeared anonymously in the Feb. 14 edition of
"The Organ," the medical student magazine.
"How would you feel if. . . when you mention to an ad
ministrator that you got the third highest score in a diffi
cult course, there is a look of absolute shock that you per
formed not just as well as, but actually better than, your
'peers.' I know how it feels."
Abe DeAnda Jr. is a student at the medical school and
received a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering
from Stanford in 1983.
Loren Borud's letter to the editor (Daily, April 28)
dealt with the perceived notion that affirmative action,
while well-intended, promotes racism in the form of
reverse discrimination. His observations and hypothetical
situations lend strong credence to his argument, but I feel
they are somewhat flawed and 1 would like to offer a few
facts and thoughts so that a more realistic discussion can
take place. The data I am using comes from the Associa
tion of American Medical Colleges and represents the
medical school class entering in 1983-84.
Myth No. /: "Special provisions for minority students
put majority students at a disadvantage." Borud men
tioned "special encouragements," special grants, assis
tance from affirmative action coordinators, etc. You may
ask why so-called "special encouragements" should be

ABE DeANDA JR.

made toward minority students. Consider this — in 1983,
35,200 students applied to medical school in the United
States. Of this amount, 2,558 (7.3 percent) were black
and 507 (1.4 percent) were Mexican-American/Chicano
. . . not exactly a stampede of minority students trying to
get into medical school.
As you can see from these numbers, minorities are
under-represented even in the applicant pool. What could
be the cause of this? Maybe minorities make up a small
subset of undergraduates who get their bachelor degrees
. . . okay, I could buy that. Or maybe minority students
are not as smart as majority students (i.e. smaller GPAs
and MCAT scores), and realizing this they don't even
bother to apply. ... I think the only one who could truly
accept this statement would be William Shockley. Or how
about this . . . minority students are convinced by cultural
standards and societal images that they can't get into
medical school, or maybe they have more pressing matters
(such as entering the work force to help support their fam
ily) — maybe these factors are actually involved to some
degree.
I think this may be true in a large number of cases.
"Special encouragements" should be used to try to dispel
some of the mystery surrounding medical school admis
sions, while providing information on such items as need
based grants and fellowships for minority students. These
provisions are not meant to increase the acceptance rate of
minority students, only to increase the applicant pool and
thereby increase the number of minority students ac
cepted.
Myth No. 2: "White males are punished via affirmative
action programs." In 1983, of the 16,480 people admitted
to medical school, 13,563 (82.3 percent) were white.
Under-represented minorities (blacks, native Americans
Alaskan natives, Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans)
made up only 1,399 new entrants. (The balance being
made up by Asian-Americans, foreign students and
"others"). If you look at the numbers, you can see that the
chance of getting admitted to medical school for anyone
(white, black, brown. . . .) is around 47 percent. Looking
at individual groups, the chances (within one percentage
point) are: whites, 50 percent; blacks, 40 percent;
Hispanics, 51 percent.
Now, if you make the inference that whites, on the
average, are more qualified to enter medical school than

minorities, then you could make a case for reverse dis
crimination. The key point is, are whites statistically more
qualified than their minority counterparts?
I don't think this is the case. I find it hard to believe that
when I was applying to medical school, my 50 percent
chance was hampering some white male's 50 percent
chance more than another white male's 50 percent
chance. Hey Loren, chill out. You are more likely to be
bumped from an acceptance list by a white applicant than
by a minority applicant.
Myth No. 3: "Qualified white males are unfairly passed
up in favor of minority students." I hope from Myth No. 2
you can start seeing cracks in this theory, but let's think
about what Borud is implying. If a highly qualified white
male is rejected from a medical school, does this imply
discrimination if minority students were accepted to the
same school? Well, maybe, if the minority students that
were accepted were less qualified and if no majority stu
dents were accepted who were also less qualified. This may
come as a surprise to you, Loren, but minority students
who are accepted to medical schools don't necessarily
make up the bottom of the barrel, a mere addendum to
the class roster. There are more minority students than
you think who are more qualified than their fellow stu
dents, based on GPA, MCAT scores, etc.
Which brings up the next point, the measurement of
qualifications. Admission officers are faced with the task
of deciding who amongst the applicant pool will make
good doctors. Given the hypothetical case Borud presents
(the qualified majority student being rejected in favor of
the equally qualified minority student), it seems only
reasonable that the admissions committee consider such
things as the number of hours that the student had to work
in order to attend school, or the environment from which
they came . . . items which cannot be reasonably quan
tified but which should be considered. Until the day all
candidates come from identical backgrounds, admissions
officers will have to consider these points.
So, what does this all mean? 1 feel that the affirmative
action program, while flawed in some respects, is needed.
People who feel that minorities would still get treated
fairly without the program must believe that societ\ is
willing to change its ideas without a struggle. For all
female, white pre-meds who believe this, I recommend
you corner a third- or fourth-year female medical student
in the student lounge someday, and ask her what it feels
like to be mistaken for a nurse, or to have a patient re
quest a male doctor, or to be called "dear" or "sweetie"
by a male attending physician. Then take Borud's letter,
maybe predate it by 30 or 40 years, and substitute
"female" wherever you see "minority student." Change
does not occur overnight, but this is the first step.
