Matherly off base
Usually, reading a Jason Matherly
column gives one the impression that
he's just trying to be contrary to
induce a response. I mean, could
anybody really be that big an ass?
Most people would like to think not,
and 1 usually try to avoid dignifying
his cynical elitist diatribes with notice
or comment, but his open advocacy of
police brutality when dealing with di
vestment protesters just cannot go
unchallenged.
If it was not clear enough from his
column (Daily. April 28), Matherly
advocates not just sufficient, but ex
cessive violence when dealing with
campus protesters. It might be in
structive to point to his statements at
the Program Board meeting where 1
was arguing for funding for a Police
Review Commission. In reference to
the brutality that Robbie Perkins and
the other Old Union protesters suf
fered in October. Matherly stated.
"They had it coming to them." And if
a similar situation arose again? "I
would hope that police would do the
same thing," Matherly stated flatly. I
wonder if Matherly would feel the

same way if the College Republicans
decided to sit in over a trustee deci
sion to deny Reagan his library here
at Stanford. Whether one agrees with
the cause of divestment or not is irrel
evant. The idea that protesters exer
cising their rights of free speech on
this or any issue should be dealt with
quickly and severely is simply unac
ceptable in a free society such as our
own.
Another interesting Matherly per
spective that reared its head at the
Program Board hearing concerned
the problem minority students on this
campus face of being stopped
routinely by police and asked for
identification while white students
are not. Matherly's response stunned
me. "Hey, the police are just doing
their job. I wouldn't want them to
stop this practice. They probably just
figure that minorities are more likely,
percentage-wise, to be criminals. I'd
rather have them stop minorities than
have a bunch of crimes start happen
ing around here." This kind of
Clarence Pendleton racism is espe
cially dangerous from someone who
helps decide which student groups
receive funding.
It's too bad that The Daily keeps

giving this guy a forum for his racist,
intolerant ravings.

Preserve the grass
We, Stanford Students for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Grass (SSPCG),
applaud the movement of the shan
tytown to the Quad. However, we
view this action as much too little,
much too late. A quick look at White
Plaza will show the misery, suffering
and death caused by the former loca
tion of the shantytown: the grass is
dead. Granted, the anti-apartheid
demonstrators have a worthy cause,
but did they have to inflict pain and
suffering on other living creatures?
Did they have to victimize innocent
plants who can't speak for them
selves? Did they even bother to give
the grass the benefit of informed con
sent?
We do not mean to single out the
anti-apartheid demonstrators. Many
students, through simple ignorance,
do not realize that the grass plants
dedicate their lives to beautify the en

vironment, to create recreational or
relaxational space and to make
oxygen for us to breathe. All they ask
in return is love, care and respect.
Think about how much you enjoy the
grass on campus. Isn't it worth your
love and respect?
If you would like to do more to
help, we always welcome new mem
bers. Currently, we are planning
rallies to help educate the Stanford
community on the importance of
grass. We were also trying to create a
SWOPSI course on the political and
social influence of grass on America,
but the University is trying to sup
press grass education, claiming that
our course would not be on the same
academic level as other Stanford
courses. (The University charges stu
dents thousands of dollars every year.
The University makes no profits from
the grass. Now, the University is
trying to prevent grass awareness.
Coincidence or cause-and-effect?)
In conclusion, we thank the anti
apartheid demonstrators for moving
their shantytown, and we ask all
members of the Stanford community
to remember the grass.

percentage-wise, to be criminals. I'd
rather have them stop minorities than
have a bunch of crimes start happen
ing around here." This kind of
Clarence Pendleton racism is espe
cially dangerous from someone who
helps decide which student groups
receive funding.
It's too bad that The Daily keeps

giving this guy a forum for his racist,
intolerant ravings.

Preserve the grass
We, Stanford Students for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Grass (SSPCG),
applaud the movement of the shan
tytown to the Quad. However, we
view this action as much too little,
much too late. A quick look at White
Plaza will show the misery, suffering
and death caused by the former loca
tion of the shantytown: the grass is
dead. Granted, the anti-apartheid
demonstrators have a worthy cause,
but did they have to inflict pain and
suffering on other living creatures?
Did they have to victimize innocent
plants who can't speak for them
selves? Did they even bother to give
the grass the benefit of informed con
sent?
We do not mean to single out the
anti-apartheid demonstrators. Many
students, through simple ignorance,
do not realize that the grass plants
dedicate their lives to beautify the en

vironment, to create recreational or
relaxational space and to make
oxygen for us to breathe. All they ask
in return is love, care and respect.
Think about how much you enjoy the
grass on campus. Isn't it worth your
love and respect?
If you would like to do more to
help, we always welcome new mem
bers. Currently, we are planning
rallies to help educate the Stanford
community on the importance of
grass. We were also trying to create a
SWOPSI course on the political and
social influence of grass on America,
but the University is trying to sup
press grass education, claiming that
our course would not be on the same
academic level as other Stanford
courses. (The University charges stu
dents thousands of dollars every year.
The University makes no profits from
the grass. Now, the University is
trying to prevent grass awareness.
Coincidence or cause-and-effect?)
In conclusion, we thank the anti
apartheid demonstrators for moving
their shantytown, and we ask all
members of the Stanford community
to remember the grass.
