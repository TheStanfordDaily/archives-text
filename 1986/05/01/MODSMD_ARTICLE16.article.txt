# Impressions of the world

"So what is Impressionism?"
This was the question we asked ourselves when we left
the museum and came into the sunlight of the Sunday af
ternoon. It was a San Francisco Sunday, so it wasn't too
sticky but rather warm and breezy, and we walked slowly
through the park. Somewhere a high school band was per
forming, and there was picnicking, rollerskating and
frisbee-playing scattered around us. A sketching class had
assembled on a grassy hillock, busy capturing the day on
their pads. And it was a fine day — the world, which we all
agreed had been too much with us, was thankfully absent.
"It's a good question," Clara said. "It's clear that even
they had a hard time defining it, knowing what it was.
Degas, for example, was going in such different directions
than Monet. And yet we call them both Impressionists."

"The uncertainty of trying to name it seems really ap
propriate," John yelled up. He and Hadley were strag
gling behind us.
"I just loved the fan," Hadley said. "There's something
about the way Degas put that together — the shape and
the colors. And to think it was all done on silk. I must
have been staring at it for five minutes."
"Oh, you know what I loved," Clara said. "That one
Pissarro with the couple walking through the woods. The
colors of the woman's dress seem to drift into the forest.
What a great effect."
"That's what I usually think of when I consider Impres
sionists," I said. "The colors all spreading into each other.
Same with shapes. It's everything changing, as if the paint
was still wet and running."
"But it does capture a moment," John said.
We came to a lunch stand along the side of the path and
ordered hot dogs and iced tea. We sat down to eat in the
grass off the path.
"Damn," Hadley said. "My skirt will probably get grass
stains." She bit into what looked more mustard than hot
dog and said, "It seems to me that Impressionism is more
suggestive of moments than anything else. A moment is
there, in front of you, but it comes with so much — I don't
know — vagueness, that you're free to imagine it however
you want. It's not an exact thing like a photograph."
I ate my lunch and then drank some iced tea, feeling it
slide coolly down my throat. Around us Golden Gate
Park was moving and sliding along its own canvas. I
leaned back. I closed my eyes and pictured the sights in
my mind while hearing the sounds splash into them.
Sometimes all you arc able to do is glimpse beauty. But is
that ever enough? I opened my eyes again and seeing it all
rush at me I realized how a past — anyone's past, a na
tion's, a civilization's — is only so many scenes upon a
painted wall. But this burst of a Sunday afternoon, this ex
plosion of light and movement, is still there to be framed.
It was nice to have this thought in reserve.
"But again," Clara said, "they suggest so many differ-

ent moods. Pissarro did that whole series on autumn, and
then so many Monets are springlike."
"And don't forget the Ice Floes," John said licking a
last bit of relish off his lips. He liked the Ice Floes very
much and had told us so several times during the exhibit.
{'There's a winter scene for you. But when you think of,
say, that Boulevard des Capucines, it's also winter but it's
a different mood. I guess that comes from the movement
of the people walking. But the Ice Floes just rest there —
that seems more peaceful."
"And it's a funny thing," Hadley said, "but some of the
scenes you would think the most relaxing, like the autumn
ones, have people working in them. Sawing or harvesting
or something. That says something about working in na
ture, how working the land isn't a stressful thing."
"To me," I said, "Impressionists suggest so many dif
ferent moods because they choose such a wide range of
subjects. Monet — sure he did a lot with pastoral settings,
but he also did that series of the railroad station. And
Renoir; he did portraits and ballrooms and nudes, but he
also worked with landscapes."
"Morisot was more consistent," Clara said. "She drew
women."
"She was easy to pick out," Hadley said. "But even
Monet, who I thought I could always recognize, slipped by
me now and then. So did Gauguin. His early stuff was so
different from what he did later on."
It was getting colder and the wind had picked up, so we
stood and started walking back to the car. I thought how
the conversation reminded me of something E.B. White
had said about essay writing. He compared it to a ward
robe. A writer could assume any garb — any style of voice
— and when he wrote he could choose any topic. In the
end, his body of work should have contradictions in it.
That is the test of his success as a writer, not how many
truths he has built into the stonework of literature. The
Impressionists seemed to have stumbled across the same
idea, and the form they found to express it could be pulled
and stretched and expanded to hold all the mystery they
saw.
The park crowd had thinned by then, and the day was
dusking to evening. Each step shot distinctive shapes and
patterns of light against the trees and beds of curling
flower.
"You know," Clara said, "Each perspective is a little
different, like in the railway station series. It's as if the art
ist was seeing the world change before his eyes and
recognized that he could never know it. So he decided in
stead of trying vainly to know it once and then leave it, he
would paint to keep up with it. I love that thought."
Seeing the world change before his eyes. It was a pretty
thought. But then again, she was a pretty girl. And I told
myself that if we then were no closer to defining Impres
sionism than when we began, we had, at least, hit upon
something else — the bundle of contradictions you dis
cover whenever you try to know anything. And the pret
tier thought was that the world of the Impressionists
allowed for these contradictions, and even made art out of
them. It was the other world, the one absent from the park
that day, which had recently been showing just how in
tolerant of contradiction, how unwilling to accept differ
ence, it could be. That was why we had agreed that this
world had been of late too much with us.

sionism than when we began, we had, at least, hit upon
something else — the bundle of contradictions you dis
cover whenever you try to know anything. And the pret
tier thought was that the world of the Impressionists
allowed for these contradictions, and even made art out of
them. It was the other world, the one absent from the park
that day, which had recently been showing just how in
tolerant of contradiction, how unwilling to accept differ
ence, it could be. That was why we had agreed that this
world had been of late too much with us.

"So what is Impressionism?"
This was the question we asked ourselves when we left
the museum and came into the sunlight of the Sunday af
ternoon. It was a San Francisco Sunday, so it wasn't too
sticky but rather warm and breezy, and we walked slowly
through the park. Somewhere a high school band was per
forming, and there was picnicking, rollerskating and
frisbee-playing scattered around us. A sketching class had
assembled on a grassy hillock, busy capturing the day on
their pads. And it was a fine day — the world, which we all
agreed had been too much with us, was thankfully absent.
"It's a good question," Clara said. "It's clear that even
they had a hard time defining it, knowing what it was.
Degas, for example, was going in such different directions
than Monet. And yet we call them both Impressionists."

"The uncertainty of trying to name it seems really ap
propriate," John yelled up. He and Hadley were strag
gling behind us.
"I just loved the fan," Hadley said. "There's something
about the way Degas put that together — the shape and
the colors. And to think it was all done on silk. I must
have been staring at it for five minutes."
"Oh, you know what I loved," Clara said. "That one
Pissarro with the couple walking through the woods. The
colors of the woman's dress seem to drift into the forest.
What a great effect."
"That's what I usually think of when I consider Impres
sionists," I said. "The colors all spreading into each other.
Same with shapes. It's everything changing, as if the paint
was still wet and running."
"But it does capture a moment," John said.
We came to a lunch stand along the side of the path and
ordered hot dogs and iced tea. We sat down to eat in the
grass off the path.
"Damn," Hadley said. "My skirt will probably get grass
stains." She bit into what looked more mustard than hot
dog and said, "It seems to me that Impressionism is more
suggestive of moments than anything else. A moment is
there, in front of you, but it comes with so much — I don't
know — vagueness, that you're free to imagine it however
you want. It's not an exact thing like a photograph."
I ate my lunch and then drank some iced tea, feeling it
slide coolly down my throat. Around us Golden Gate
Park was moving and sliding along its own canvas. I
leaned back. I closed my eyes and pictured the sights in
my mind while hearing the sounds splash into them.
Sometimes all you arc able to do is glimpse beauty. But is
that ever enough? I opened my eyes again and seeing it all
rush at me I realized how a past — anyone's past, a na
tion's, a civilization's — is only so many scenes upon a
painted wall. But this burst of a Sunday afternoon, this ex
plosion of light and movement, is still there to be framed.
It was nice to have this thought in reserve.
"But again," Clara said, "they suggest so many differ-

ent moods. Pissarro did that whole series on autumn, and
then so many Monets are springlike."
"And don't forget the Ice Floes," John said licking a
last bit of relish off his lips. He liked the Ice Floes very
much and had told us so several times during the exhibit.
{'There's a winter scene for you. But when you think of,
say, that Boulevard des Capucines, it's also winter but it's
a different mood. I guess that comes from the movement
of the people walking. But the Ice Floes just rest there —
that seems more peaceful."
"And it's a funny thing," Hadley said, "but some of the
scenes you would think the most relaxing, like the autumn
ones, have people working in them. Sawing or harvesting
or something. That says something about working in na
ture, how working the land isn't a stressful thing."
"To me," I said, "Impressionists suggest so many dif
ferent moods because they choose such a wide range of
subjects. Monet — sure he did a lot with pastoral settings,
but he also did that series of the railroad station. And
Renoir; he did portraits and ballrooms and nudes, but he
also worked with landscapes."
"Morisot was more consistent," Clara said. "She drew
women."
"She was easy to pick out," Hadley said. "But even
Monet, who I thought I could always recognize, slipped by
me now and then. So did Gauguin. His early stuff was so
different from what he did later on."
It was getting colder and the wind had picked up, so we
stood and started walking back to the car. I thought how
the conversation reminded me of something E.B. White
had said about essay writing. He compared it to a ward
robe. A writer could assume any garb — any style of voice
— and when he wrote he could choose any topic. In the
end, his body of work should have contradictions in it.
That is the test of his success as a writer, not how many
truths he has built into the stonework of literature. The
Impressionists seemed to have stumbled across the same
idea, and the form they found to express it could be pulled
and stretched and expanded to hold all the mystery they
saw.
The park crowd had thinned by then, and the day was
dusking to evening. Each step shot distinctive shapes and
patterns of light against the trees and beds of curling
flower.
"You know," Clara said, "Each perspective is a little
different, like in the railway station series. It's as if the art
ist was seeing the world change before his eyes and
recognized that he could never know it. So he decided in
stead of trying vainly to know it once and then leave it, he
would paint to keep up with it. I love that thought."
Seeing the world change before his eyes. It was a pretty
thought. But then again, she was a pretty girl. And I told
