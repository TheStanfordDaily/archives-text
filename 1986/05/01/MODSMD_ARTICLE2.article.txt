# Nuclear catastrophe moves in on Europe

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Experts here say Europeans could suffer both short
and long-term medical consequences as a result of the So
viet nuclear reactor accident, hut caution that no one can
make accurate predictions until all the facts of the disaster
are known.
The severity of the consequences is determined by a
number of unknown factors â€” the history of the Cher
nobyl reactor, the age of the fuel, the direction of the
prevailing winds and the length of time between when the
reactor was shut off and when it exploded, according to
radiologists at the Medical Center.
"Until we have numbers, it's difficult to take readings
(of wind-blown radiation levels) in Sweden, Finland and
Poland and extrapolate backward," Radiology Prof.
Roland Finston said.
"It is conceivable that the reactor could have caught
fire, there could have been deaths at the site, there could
be radiation readings in northern Europe without there
being any acute radiation sickness," Finston added.
Radiology Prof. Herbert Abrams, however, said
regardless of the details the accident is the worst nuclear
disaster ever.
"My guess is that the suggestion that there are
thousands who have died has a ring of credibility,"
Abrams said. "And if, for example, there are 2,000 dead,
then there must be 7,000-10,000 alive (with severe burns
or acute radiation sickness)."
As of late last night, the Soviet government had ad
mitted two dead and 197 hospitalized as a result of the
disaster, but residents of Kiev and visting U.S. citizens
have reported thousands of casualties. U.S. intelligence
suspects that fire is continuing to spew radioactive debris
into the air and that another reactor may be in danger of

melting down.
The latest reports indicate that the reactor, located in
the Soviet Ukraine about 60 miles south of Kiev, ex
ploded Saturday after experiencing a cooling system fail
ure Friday.
" My guess is that it's a matter of hundreds or thousands
of surviving people with acute radiation syndrome or
burns," Abrams said. Acute radiation syndrome is a con
dition resulting from exposure to radioactivity that often
leads to death in a few days to months after contact, he ex
plained.

J. Garrott Allen, professor emeritus of surgery who
worked on development of the first U.S. atomic bomb in
the late 19405, called the amount of released radiation
"enormous," but said the consequences of the accident
will not be known perhaps for as many as 25 years.
Long-term consequences of the accident include the
possibility that radioactive material will settle on the
ground and enter the food chain, according to Abrams.
He described a scenario in which hazardous material
landed on a grass field where cows graze. A cow, after
eating the grass, is slaughtered, and the radioactive parti
cles are transmitted to a human.
Abrams said an increased incidence of leukemia in the
vicinity of the accident is likely in about four or five years,
based on data from the 1945 Hiroshima bombing.
More immediately, however, Abrams said the Soviets
are likely experiencing a shortage of hospital beds
equipped to treat burn victims. There are 10 to 15 such
beds in Kiev for more than two million city residents, he
said.
