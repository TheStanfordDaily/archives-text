Now I know that I am an intellec
tual. It all adds up. A bad home, poor
diet, not liking punk. I think I will join
the library and see what happpens.
Sue Townsend's first two novels,
"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole
Aged 13-3/4" and "The Growing
Pains of Adrian Mole" will soon be
available in one volume in the United
States. The two works, which con
stitute "The Adrian Mole Diaries,"
received great critical and popular ac
claim when they were published in
Britian in 1982 and 1984. Together
they sold more than five million
copies. Both a musical and a televi
sion series based on the novel have
received the same popular attention.
With such a record of success, it could
only be a matter of time before the
product reached the other side of the
Atlantic — another first-class British
import a la "Chariots of Fire" and
"Brideshead Revisited."
The fundamental difference be
tween the Diaries and these other
works is that the novel is written in
diary form and narrated by the En
glish schoolboy Adrian Mole, a
precocious, neurotic teenager com
plete with "spots," anxieties about
sexual dysfunctions, and issues of
"Big and Bouncy" under his
mattress. The characters which ap
pear in the Diaries include: Adrian's
mother (who runs away with the
next-door neighbor whose wife has
left him for. . .well, you get the
point), his father (who has an affair
with a woman Adrian calls "Stick In
sect"), a quirky grandmother, an ec
centric chain-smoking pensioner
named Bert, various neighbors and
teachers and, of course, Adrian's true
love — Pandora. Townsend has
quirky and insightful things to say
about all of these people, as well as
Margaret Thatcher, The Falkland Is

lands and unemployment.
Adrian is a pimply adolescent who
worries about everything and records
all of his anxieties in his journal.
"They are getting a divorce," he
writes. "Neither of them want to
leave the house so the spare room is
being turned into a bedsitter for my
father. This could have a very bad ef
fect on me. It could prevent me from
being a vet." The dog he practices his
veterinary skills on ends up requiring
real veterinary attention and Adrian
observes, "The dog is back. It keeps

licking its stitches, so when I am
eating I sit with my back to it." His
egotism is complete: "I am reading
'How Children Fail' by John Holt. It
is dead good. If I fail my 'O' levels it
will be all my parents' fault." Day
after day Adrian records his grand
mother's retrieval of protection
money taken from him by the school
bully, the discovery of French
postcards in Bert's apartment and his
own embarrassment in the school
showers. Births, deaths, the protests
at Greenham Common — all are re

corded with the same ironically dis
passionate eye, resulting in a
genuinely entertaining social record
of England in recent years.
Adrian would hardly see it as this,
and that is what makes the novel as
wonderful as it is. He is much more
occupied with his Raskolnikovian life
as unrequited lover and unap
preciated writer. These two avoca
tions, if one may call them that,
combine when he writes the following
poem about Pandora's horse and
submits it to the BBC:
Little Brown Horse /Eating apples
in a field, /Perhaps one day /My heart
will be healed. H stroke the places
Pandora has sat /Wearing her jod
phurs and riding hat. /Goodbye,
brown horse. II turn and retreat, /The
rain and mud are wetting my feet."
This is Mole at his best.
Townsend captures the fears of
adolescence perfectly: "Nigel has ar
ranged for me to have a blind date
with Sharon Botts. I am meeting her
at the roller-skating rink on Saturday.
I am dead nervous. I don't know how
to rollerskate — let alone make
love."
The novel is less successful in its so
cial critique, but this is more a func
tion of its "Britishness" than an indi
cation of Townsend's ability.
Townsend and the Grove Press at
tempt to demystify Adrian's constant
references to popular figures and po
litical topics by including a glossary in
the back, ostensibly written for
Adrian's American friend, Hamish
Mancini. The very presence of Man
cini is alienating, as he is an exagger
ated version of what the British per
ceive Americans to be: his mother is
on her fourth marriage, he says
"wow" a lot, and "Jee-sus." He
writes Adrian a request for a glossary
which ends: "P.S. Mum's in the Betty
Ford Clinic. She's doin' okay.
They've cured everything but the
kleptomania."
While the glossary itself is helpful,
answering questions a reader might
have (like who is Malcolm Mug
geridge?), it can't quite bridge the
cultural gap between Adrian's Eng
land and the United States. The very
tone of the novel takes getting used

to; it is fair to say that though the
content and language of the story are
consistent, the Diaries improve as
they go along. Adrian's descriptions
of his surroundings and his humor
grow more accessible to an American
reader as the reader becomes attuned
to the nuances and understatement of
his language. His world becomes the
only place of any importance not only
for Adrian but for the reader. The
two years which the diary cover take
Adrian from the naivete of a pre
adolescent to the false worldliness of

one who has a chance of surviving in
the infinitely more complicated adult
world.
Just as Adrian survives his adoles
cence, the Diaries manage to survive
their transatlantic journey. This is a
testament to Sue Townsend's skill as
a humorist. At one point, Adrian's
mother says, "There is only one thing
more deadly boring than listening to
other people's dreams, and that is lis
tening to other people's problems."
"The Adrian Mole Diaries" prove
that this is not always true.

Now I know that I am an intellec
tual. It all adds up. A bad home, poor
diet, not liking punk. I think I will join
the library and see what happpens.
Sue Townsend's first two novels,
"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole
Aged 13-3/4" and "The Growing
Pains of Adrian Mole" will soon be
available in one volume in the United
States. The two works, which con
stitute "The Adrian Mole Diaries,"
received great critical and popular ac
claim when they were published in
Britian in 1982 and 1984. Together
they sold more than five million
copies. Both a musical and a televi
sion series based on the novel have
received the same popular attention.
With such a record of success, it could
only be a matter of time before the
product reached the other side of the
Atlantic — another first-class British
import a la "Chariots of Fire" and
"Brideshead Revisited."
The fundamental difference be
tween the Diaries and these other
works is that the novel is written in
diary form and narrated by the En
glish schoolboy Adrian Mole, a
precocious, neurotic teenager com
plete with "spots," anxieties about
sexual dysfunctions, and issues of
"Big and Bouncy" under his
mattress. The characters which ap
pear in the Diaries include: Adrian's
mother (who runs away with the
next-door neighbor whose wife has
left him for. . .well, you get the
point), his father (who has an affair
with a woman Adrian calls "Stick In
sect"), a quirky grandmother, an ec
centric chain-smoking pensioner
named Bert, various neighbors and
teachers and, of course, Adrian's true
love — Pandora. Townsend has
quirky and insightful things to say
about all of these people, as well as
Margaret Thatcher, The Falkland Is

lands and unemployment.
Adrian is a pimply adolescent who
worries about everything and records
all of his anxieties in his journal.
"They are getting a divorce," he
writes. "Neither of them want to
leave the house so the spare room is
being turned into a bedsitter for my
father. This could have a very bad ef
fect on me. It could prevent me from
being a vet." The dog he practices his
veterinary skills on ends up requiring
real veterinary attention and Adrian
observes, "The dog is back. It keeps

licking its stitches, so when I am
eating I sit with my back to it." His
egotism is complete: "I am reading
'How Children Fail' by John Holt. It
is dead good. If I fail my 'O' levels it
will be all my parents' fault." Day
after day Adrian records his grand
mother's retrieval of protection
money taken from him by the school
bully, the discovery of French
postcards in Bert's apartment and his
own embarrassment in the school
showers. Births, deaths, the protests
at Greenham Common — all are re

corded with the same ironically dis
passionate eye, resulting in a
genuinely entertaining social record
of England in recent years.
Adrian would hardly see it as this,
and that is what makes the novel as
wonderful as it is. He is much more
occupied with his Raskolnikovian life
as unrequited lover and unap
preciated writer. These two avoca
tions, if one may call them that,
combine when he writes the following
poem about Pandora's horse and
submits it to the BBC:
Little Brown Horse /Eating apples
in a field, /Perhaps one day /My heart
will be healed. H stroke the places
Pandora has sat /Wearing her jod
phurs and riding hat. /Goodbye,
brown horse. II turn and retreat, /The
rain and mud are wetting my feet."
This is Mole at his best.
Townsend captures the fears of
adolescence perfectly: "Nigel has ar
ranged for me to have a blind date
with Sharon Botts. I am meeting her
at the roller-skating rink on Saturday.
I am dead nervous. I don't know how
to rollerskate — let alone make
love."
The novel is less successful in its so
cial critique, but this is more a func
tion of its "Britishness" than an indi
cation of Townsend's ability.
Townsend and the Grove Press at
tempt to demystify Adrian's constant
references to popular figures and po
litical topics by including a glossary in
the back, ostensibly written for
Adrian's American friend, Hamish
Mancini. The very presence of Man
cini is alienating, as he is an exagger
ated version of what the British per
ceive Americans to be: his mother is
on her fourth marriage, he says
"wow" a lot, and "Jee-sus." He
writes Adrian a request for a glossary
which ends: "P.S. Mum's in the Betty
Ford Clinic. She's doin' okay.
They've cured everything but the
kleptomania."
While the glossary itself is helpful,
answering questions a reader might
have (like who is Malcolm Mug
geridge?), it can't quite bridge the
cultural gap between Adrian's Eng
land and the United States. The very
tone of the novel takes getting used

to; it is fair to say that though the
