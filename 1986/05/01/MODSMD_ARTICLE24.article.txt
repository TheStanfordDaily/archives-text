## S.F. displays Impressionistic paintings 
### LESLIE WELLS 
"The New Painting: Impressionism 1874-1886,"
which opened Saturday, April 19 at the M.H. De
Young Memorial Museum, is a celebration of a
small group of artists who banded together and
held eight separate exhibitions, the last one exactly
a century ago.
Artists such as Monet, Renoir and Caillebotte
presented their paintings in the exhibitions to an
astonished public. The works themselves were
revolutionary in their rejection of the principles of
traditional realism, their choice of subject matter
and their use ol light and color to create an impres
sion.
Never belore had artists presented their works in
exhibitions which they organized themselves.
Traditionally, in Paris, the juries who controlled
the acceptance of a painting into the annual Salons
selected works of conservative artists, who
represented the conventional aesthetic values. In
this way the juries set standards for French art.

In 1874, Monet, Degas and others grew tired of
not being recognized in the official Salons, and as a
result organized the first group show of 165 works
by 30 artists.
By recreating in part the eight exhibitions given
by the "independents," Charles Moffett, curator in
charge of the department of European painting at
M. H. De Young, illuminates important aspects of
Impressionism which have gone unnoticed in the
past. One can see from this collection the revolu
tionary spirit behind this artistic movement and the
roles of the artists in changing the traditional
course of painting.
At "The New Painting," one can see the works
with which the artists chose to represent them
selves, rather than ones which a modern curator
would choose. One can also see, for the first time,
works of such lesser-known painters as Bra
quemond, Cals, Desboutin and Zandomeneghi,
who are barely represented in Paris' Impressionism
museums, the Jeu De Paume and L'Orangerie.
The more mediocre paintings by these lesser

known artists hang next to the works of the masters
at the De Young. They provide a contrast and give
a broader perspective of the movement.
Next to paintings which have withstood art's test
of time and are considered to be the most beautiful
of the Impressionistic era are derogatory comments
of critics from 100 years ago, showing the general
negative reaction of their day. One criticism read,
"Seen up close, (Pissarro's landscapes) are incom
prehensible and hideous, seen from a distance, they
are hideous and incomprehensible."
By 1876, the date of the second show, many ob
servers recognized that a true movement was
emerging. The respected novelist and critic Ed
mond Duranty wrote an essay in praise of what he
called "The New Painting." in which he defined the
modern painting. Duranty's phrase became the title
of the San Francisco exhibition recognizing Impres
sionism as a radical departure from traditional
painting.
"The New Painting" exhibition consists of 150
works loaned by private collectors and approxi
mately 70 North American, European, Japanese
and Australian museums around the world. Ap
proximately 20 paintings come from the Jeu De
Paume in Paris and will no longer travel once the
new Impressionism museum opens there at the
Musee d'Orsay in the fall. The exhibition is spon
sored by AT&T.
Demand for the tickets is so great that reserva
tions must be made for a specific date and time.
Weekends in May are already sold out. The best
time to see the show is early in the morning when
the crowds tend to be a little less dense. Tickets, $6
at the museum, can be purchased from all BASS
outlets. The show runs through July 6.
Exhibition hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on
weekends and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on week
days, except for Mondays when the museum is
closed.

"The New Painting" exhibition consists of 150
works loaned by private collectors and approxi
mately 70 North American, European, Japanese
and Australian museums around the world. Ap
proximately 20 paintings come from the Jeu De
Paume in Paris and will no longer travel once the
new Impressionism museum opens there at the
Musee d'Orsay in the fall. The exhibition is spon
sored by AT&T.
Demand for the tickets is so great that reserva
tions must be made for a specific date and time.
Weekends in May are already sold out. The best
time to see the show is early in the morning when
the crowds tend to be a little less dense. Tickets, $6
at the museum, can be purchased from all BASS
outlets. The show runs through July 6.
Exhibition hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on
weekends and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on week
days, except for Mondays when the museum is
closed.
