## Those you love to hate and a strange sports quiz 
### 
The strained, impish expression stretched
across his face, until he looked something like
an agitated chihuahua.
He stood there motionless, his mouth
drooping a bit as he stared dumbly at the mal
feasant in stripes. Once more, the call had
gone against him. Oh, how he whined.
His name is Danny Ainge. In general,
people hate him. Hate is a strong word, but I
think it applies here.
Currently, Ainge could be in the forefront
of America's most detestable athletes. No of
fense, Danny.
Why do people hate this Brigham Young
product? Probably for the same reasons that
people dislike Jerry Lewis movies. There's a
lot of pouting and annoying faces.
American sports fans do seem to possess
this insatiable urge to hate a few athletes.
Many characteristics help determine whether
an athlete will make this infamous list, but
one certain trait clinches it — facial expres
sion.

In order to stay clear of any sort of booster
club belligerence, an athlete must complain or
celebrate with some facial flair or style. To
start, let's look at celebration.
Without question, one has to use San
Diego's Steve Garvey (he's still a Dodger to
me) as a key example. One incident stands
clear. After a clutch home run in the playoffs,
Garvey ran around the field with a deter
mined. militaristic expression and his right
arm extended upward in triumph.
Sounds picky, but he simply showed no
emotion or charisma. It was sort of like Mr.
Rogers trying his neighbor's vanilla pudding
— a special moment.
Garvey's clean-cut image does little to ap
pease his critics. He is the kind of kid that
relished "Big Blue Marble" on Saturday
mornings. Rumor has it that he hopes to ap
pear in an Air Supply video.
An antithesis to Garvey would be Chicago's
Carlton Fisk. After waving and jumping along
the first base line, unable to tell whether his

lineshot would stay fair, Fisk leapt for jov as
his hit bounced off the foul pole for a game
winning home run for the Boston Red Sox
against the Cincinati Reds in the 1975 World
Series.
Then there is the art of proper complaint.
Some athletes come across as savvy. Sports
announcers will say, "He's such a competi
tor."
And then there is the aforementioned
Ainge way. Boorish and whiny — irritating
enough to make harp seals go into a feeding
frenzy.

Boston's Kevin McHule and Dennis
Johnson follow their teammate's example
(there seems to be a trend here). In Ainge
like fashion, they scowl and grimace inces
santly. No referee's call is a good one.
This is not to say that an athlete needs to be
a happy clam at all times. On the contrary,
anger and swashbuckling fury are dynamic
traits that lend credibility to the particular
sport.
Witness Minnesota Vikings quarterback
Tommy Kramer, a player who perpetually
argues with officials and still maintains
popularity with fans. People loved tennis Ilie
"Nasty" Nastase.
So why can't athletes like Ainge, Johnson
and McHale (to reiterate, all Celtics) com
plain with impunity? Once again, it's facial
expression. Fans simply do not tolerate dis
senting ugliness.
Other notables include: Boston's Larry
Bird (this is getting ridiculous), Detroit's Bill
Laimbeer, Houston's Ralph Sampson and

Golden State's Joe Barry Carroll, tennis' John
McEnroe, track and field's Mary Decker-
Tabb-Slaney. hockey's Bruce and Brian Sutter
of the Philadelphia Flyers and most of the
Los Angeles Raiders.
Now for something completely different.
