# Card golfers at Sun Devil tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Beginning perhaps its toughest
stretch of the season, the Stanford
men's golf team tees off today in
the Sun Devil Intercollegiate at
McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale,
Ariz.
The 54-hole tournament is the
first half of a trip on which the
Cardinal will play six rounds of
golf in seven days. Immediately
after the final round of the Sun
Devil on Saturday, the team flies
to Los Angeles, where it will play
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships May 5-7.
Making the trip will be the six
golfers Stanford Coach Tim
Schaaf has started virtually the
entire spring: Carl Wagner, Don
Walsworth, John Dickey, Roger
Miraglia, Rich Marik and Phil
Rowley.
They will be challenged at the
Sun Devil by some of the nation's
leading golfers, including USC's
Sam Randolph, Fresno State's

Tim Loustalot and host school
Arizona State's Bill Mayfair and
Rich Bietz.
The Sun Devil features a strong
intersectional field with the best
teams from the West Coast,
namely ASU, USC, UCLA,
Fresno State and Stanford, as well
as top teams from other areas,
such as Brigham Young and Mis
souri.
"It's a very tough field," Schaaf
said. "Arizona State always plays
very well there, and they have a
very good team this year.
"It's so competitive," Schaaf
said, "(that) I would think a finish
in the top three would be a good,
solid finish."
The last statement by Schaaf
may be an understatement. Con
sidering that Stanford, the fourth
ranked team on the West Coast,
has usually been finishing behind
ASU, USC and Fresno State in
1986, and that Brigham Young
outshot Stanford bv 36 strokes

when the teams met last week in the
Cougar Classic in Provo, Utah, if the
Cardinal were to pull together and
finish third at the Sun Devil, it would
be quite a boost toward the Pac-lOs.
"We'll be chasing USC and
Arizona State (at the Pac-lOs),"
Schaaf said, "but 1 think we can get
them if we play well. We're consid
ered to be the third-ranked team in
the Pac-10 — any finish better that
would be really good."
If Stanford can weather this trip, it
will be able to cool down at home for
three weeks before its final destina
tion, the NCAAs in Winston-Salem,
N.C., May 28-31.
