# Players excited about choice

When talking about new Coach
Mike Montgomery, the members of
the Stanford men's basketball team
seem to have two things in common.
One is that they had never heard of
him. Two weeks ago, not one of the
four players interviewed last night
could have told you that Montgomery
was the coach at the University of
Montana.
More important, however, is the
second similarity. The Cardinal
players, after meeting with
Montgomery for the first time on
Tuesday, find him to be a
knowledgeable, enthusiastic and
hard-working man capable of im
proving the Stanford program.
"I found him a very young, very
positive coach with positive ideas,"
freshman center Howard Wright said.
"He has a new attitude — a change
that we needed."
"We all think it's a pretty good sit
uation," freshman swingman Todd
Lichti said. "He told us he was going
to work hard and that we were going
to have to work hard to be success
ful."
Any team that has seen its coach
leave, for whatever reason, will
respond to a coach who makes it clear
that he is happy about his new situa
tion. "I can't help but be excited be
cause he's so excited," sophomore
center Eric Reveno said. "He told us
he's 'really jacked' about being here,
that this is where he's always wanted
to be. He told us he wants to stay a
long time."
It is no great wonder that the
players are excited about having
Montgomery, because they had a part
in bringing him to the Farm. As part
of his search for a new coach, Athletic
Director Andy Geiger set up a
players' committee, with one from
each class participating. The commit
tee included Lichti, Reveno, junior
Novian Whitsitt and senior Earl
Koberlein, who were chosen by the
other players.
The committee interviewed three,
presumably the final three, candi
dates in private for about 45 minutes
each. The players then had what
Koberlein called a "brainstorming"
session with Geiger to discuss the
candidates.
Still, the players stressed that the
final decision was Geiger's. "Mr.
Geiger formed a feedback commit
tee," Reveno said. "People have
called it a selection committee, and I
don't really like that."
"I feel that Andy made the choice,
but 1 felt he listened to our input,"
Lichti said.
Wright believed, and was hoping,
that Geiger would choose someone
like Montgomery. "I think Andy
Geiger has done a better job than
anyone could have asked in such a
short time," Wright said. "I had a
feeling that Mr. Geiger would select
someone at a smaller school anxious
to move up to a place like Stanford."
Koberlein, a graduating senior who
missed nearly half the season with a

knee injury, was just glad to contrib
ute to Stanford basketball again. "I
was really excited to be part of the
program again," he said. "1 didn't
want to just go away."
Although a formal list was never
submitted to Geiger, it was evident
that the committee was high on
Montgomery. "He was easy to talk
to, not tense," Lichti said. "He was
enthusiastic, organized and seemed to
know the game well."
"He really knew about Stanford,
the players and the program." Kober
lein said. "He did his homework."
"He knows his basketball,"
Reveno said. "He's the type of guy
who will get down and work with you,
making you go to the weight room
and stuff like that. He will have a
closer relationship to the players than
other coaches."
Wright believes the team will bene
fit from a release from the

"confinement" of former Coach Tom
Davis' system, agreeing that while
Davis tended to make his players fit
his system, Montgomery seems more
likely to make his system fit the
players strengths. Wright also added
that Montgomery seems "a lot more
energetic than Coach Davis."
Although they all respect Davis'
coaching ability, the other players in
terviewed also saw possible positive
aspects from his departure. For
Reveno and other reserves, the
change means an opportunity to
make a fresh start in the Stanford
program.
"The guys on the team see this as a
chance," Reveno said. "It puts every
one in the same boat. It's like every
one is a freshman."
"I think Coach Davis' leaving has
brought them all together," Kober
lein said. "It might be a 'prove him
wrong' type of thing."
Lichti agrees that the change may

be good for team unity. "This type of
situation will bring the team closer to
gether," he said. "It will make things
more enjoyable."
Although the first meeting was a
little too early to be discussing a great
deal of basketball philosophy, Wright
offered this insight into Stanford bas
ketball in the Montgomery era. "My
initial feeling," he said, "is that we're
gonna score points and play the hell
out of defense."
Koberlein said that while the coach
will only take the team as far as the
players' hard work will let him, he
was optimistic about the future of the
Cardinal and wished he could be a
part of it.
"Every once in a while I think
about trying to petition or something
to get another year," said Koberlein,
who expects to be healthy enough to
participate in pickup games with the
team this summer. "But I don't think
that's going to happen."

Wright believed, and was hoping,
that Geiger would choose someone
like Montgomery. "I think Andy
Geiger has done a better job than
anyone could have asked in such a
short time," Wright said. "I had a
feeling that Mr. Geiger would select
someone at a smaller school anxious
to move up to a place like Stanford."
Koberlein, a graduating senior who
missed nearly half the season with a

knee injury, was just glad to contrib
ute to Stanford basketball again. "I
was really excited to be part of the
program again," he said. "1 didn't
want to just go away."
Although a formal list was never
submitted to Geiger, it was evident
that the committee was high on
Montgomery. "He was easy to talk
to, not tense," Lichti said. "He was
enthusiastic, organized and seemed to
know the game well."
"He really knew about Stanford,
the players and the program." Kober
lein said. "He did his homework."
"He knows his basketball,"
Reveno said. "He's the type of guy
who will get down and work with you,
making you go to the weight room
and stuff like that. He will have a
closer relationship to the players than
other coaches."
Wright believes the team will bene
fit from a release from the

"confinement" of former Coach Tom
Davis' system, agreeing that while
Davis tended to make his players fit
his system, Montgomery seems more
likely to make his system fit the
players strengths. Wright also added
that Montgomery seems "a lot more
energetic than Coach Davis."
Although they all respect Davis'
coaching ability, the other players in
terviewed also saw possible positive
aspects from his departure. For
Reveno and other reserves, the
change means an opportunity to
make a fresh start in the Stanford
program.
"The guys on the team see this as a
chance," Reveno said. "It puts every
one in the same boat. It's like every
one is a freshman."
"I think Coach Davis' leaving has
brought them all together," Kober
lein said. "It might be a 'prove him
wrong' type of thing."
Lichti agrees that the change may

be good for team unity. "This type of
situation will bring the team closer to
gether," he said. "It will make things
more enjoyable."
Although the first meeting was a
little too early to be discussing a great
deal of basketball philosophy, Wright
offered this insight into Stanford bas
ketball in the Montgomery era. "My
initial feeling," he said, "is that we're
gonna score points and play the hell
out of defense."
Koberlein said that while the coach
will only take the team as far as the
players' hard work will let him, he
was optimistic about the future of the
Cardinal and wished he could be a
part of it.
"Every once in a while I think
about trying to petition or something
to get another year," said Koberlein,
who expects to be healthy enough to
participate in pickup games with the
team this summer. "But I don't think
that's going to happen."

The general reaction of the Stanford basketball players to the hiring of Coach Mike Montgomery is that they
are enthusiastic and anxious to begin the 1986-87 season. Sophomore center Eric Reveno is also looking for
ward to playing for Montgomery." He knows his basketball," Reveno said. "He's the type of guy who will get
down and work with you."
When talking about new Coach
Mike Montgomery, the members of
the Stanford men's basketball team
seem to have two things in common.
One is that they had never heard of
him. Two weeks ago, not one of the
four players interviewed last night
could have told you that Montgomery
was the coach at the University of
Montana.
More important, however, is the
second similarity. The Cardinal
players, after meeting with
Montgomery for the first time on
Tuesday, find him to be a
knowledgeable, enthusiastic and
hard-working man capable of im
proving the Stanford program.
"I found him a very young, very
positive coach with positive ideas,"
freshman center Howard Wright said.
"He has a new attitude — a change
that we needed."
"We all think it's a pretty good sit
uation," freshman swingman Todd
Lichti said. "He told us he was going
to work hard and that we were going
to have to work hard to be success
ful."
Any team that has seen its coach
leave, for whatever reason, will
respond to a coach who makes it clear
that he is happy about his new situa
tion. "I can't help but be excited be
cause he's so excited," sophomore
center Eric Reveno said. "He told us
he's 'really jacked' about being here,
that this is where he's always wanted
to be. He told us he wants to stay a
long time."
It is no great wonder that the
players are excited about having
Montgomery, because they had a part
in bringing him to the Farm. As part
of his search for a new coach, Athletic
Director Andy Geiger set up a
players' committee, with one from
each class participating. The commit
tee included Lichti, Reveno, junior
Novian Whitsitt and senior Earl
Koberlein, who were chosen by the
other players.
The committee interviewed three,
presumably the final three, candi
dates in private for about 45 minutes
each. The players then had what
Koberlein called a "brainstorming"
session with Geiger to discuss the
candidates.
Still, the players stressed that the
final decision was Geiger's. "Mr.
Geiger formed a feedback commit
tee," Reveno said. "People have
called it a selection committee, and I
don't really like that."
"I feel that Andy made the choice,
but 1 felt he listened to our input,"
Lichti said.
Wright believed, and was hoping,
that Geiger would choose someone
like Montgomery. "I think Andy
Geiger has done a better job than
anyone could have asked in such a
