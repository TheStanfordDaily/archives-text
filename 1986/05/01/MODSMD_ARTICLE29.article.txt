BOSTON â€” It took another pitcher to let Roger
Gemens know that he was flirting with history as
the Boston Red Sox right-hander neared a major
league record 20 strikeouts.
"He told me I needed two strikeouts and to go
out and get it," Clemens said of teammate Al Nip
per's comments entering the ninth inning of Bos
ton's 3-1 victory Tuesday night over the Seattle
Mariners.
"That entire inning was all adrenalin. I was just
out there throwing," Clemens said.
It was a power-pitching performance that left
Nipper in awe.
"I'd love to throw as hard as he did tonight. I hat
was something nobody has ever seen, Nipper said.
"That was the greatest game I ever saw anyone
pitch. We're all going to Atlanta tomorrow and get
our arms operated on."
Nipper was referring to the arthroscopic surgery
Clemens underwent in Columbus. Ga., last Aug. 30
to repair torn cartilege in his right shoulder.
But it's something Clemens says is history.
"All of the injury is behind me. I m tired of
hearing about that. All I know is what the record

book says."
Clemens' effort moved him past three of modern
baseball's legendary pitchers in the record book.
Nolan Ryan of the 1974 California Angels, Tom
Seaver of the 1970 New York Mets and Steve
Carlton of the 1969 St. Louis Cardinals each struck
out 19 in nine innings.
But Clemens' record performance was not lim
ited to the nine-inning feat.
He fanned eight consecutive batters from the
fourth into the sixth innings to tie the American
League mark accomplished twice by Ryan with the
Angels and once by Ron Davis while he was with
the New York Yankees.
The 20 strikeouts also snapped the previous high
of 16 by one pitcher at Fenway Park set by Jack
Harshman of the Chicago White Sox on July 25,
1954,
All the statistics and names are not wasted on
Clemens.
"To be mentioned in the same breath with all the
great pitchers who have played this game, I have no
words for that." he said. "I'm just happy there's
someone up there looking over me."

Praise and big numbers had been projected for
Clemens ever since he was the winning pitcher for
Texas in the Longhorns' 4-3 victory over Alabama
in the final game of the 1983 NCAA champion
ship.
However, injury shortened his first two seasons
in the majors after Clemens experienced quick suc
cess in the Red Sox farm system.
He notched a 3-1 record with Winter Haven and
went 4-1 with a 1.38 ERA in seven starts with New
Britain of the Eastern League in 1983.
He posted two victories in the Eastern League
playoffs, allowing one earned run in 17 innings
while helping New Britain win the league champi
onship.
On Aug. 31, 1984. Clemens' season was cut
short by an injury to his right forearm while pitch
ing against the Cleveland Indians. He had struck
out seven in three-and-two-thirds innings before
being forced out of the game.
Then came the shoulder problems last year.
So far this year, Clemens has won all four of his
decisions.
