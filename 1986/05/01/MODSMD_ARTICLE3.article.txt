# DUs appeal decision
## Fraternity claims bias plagued investigation 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
I"he president of the Delta Up
silons Tuesday appealed the Inter
fraternity Council's decision to
revoke the fraternity's recognition.
In a letter to IFC President Don
Galles, Scott Hartman wrote that bias
plagued the entire IFC investigation
of the DUs. In addition, Hartman
said last night that members of the
IFC Review Board, the judicial body
of the IFC, had decided the fate of
the fraternity before any testimony
from the DUs had been heard.
The IFC decided last Tuesday to
revoke recognition of the DUs for

two years. After that period, the fra
ternity could petition to regain IFC
recognition under probationary status
for six months! after which time the
IFC would vote whether to reinstate
full recogntion to the fraternity.
The IFC also recommeded the
University disband the fraternity and
take away its house.
In a letter delivered last Tuesday to
Hartman, the board cited an April 12
incident in which a burning couch was
thrown off a third floor balcony of the
DU house as an indication of the
deeper problems facing the DUs.
In that incident, two members of
the DU house dragged a couch to the
third floor balcony. Despite instruc

tions from Hartman to stop, one of
the two lit the couch on fire and threw
it off the balcony. The individual re
sponsible for the act has been disas
sociated from the house. Hartman
said after the incident.
The board wrote Hartman that
since there were several members of
the fraternity present at the time of
the incident who were aware of the
intentions of the members, the action
was not individual.
However, Hartman wrote Galles
that the incident was the action of two
individuals and should not be
generalized to reflect the character of
