# DUs appeal decision
## Fraternity claims bias plagued investigation 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
I"he president of the Delta Up
silons Tuesday appealed the Inter
fraternity Council's decision to
revoke the fraternity's recognition.
In a letter to IFC President Don
Galles, Scott Hartman wrote that bias
plagued the entire IFC investigation
of the DUs. In addition, Hartman
said last night that members of the
IFC Review Board, the judicial body
of the IFC, had decided the fate of
the fraternity before any testimony
from the DUs had been heard.
The IFC decided last Tuesday to
revoke recognition of the DUs for

two years. After that period, the fra
ternity could petition to regain IFC
recognition under probationary status
for six months! after which time the
IFC would vote whether to reinstate
full recogntion to the fraternity.
The IFC also recommeded the
University disband the fraternity and
take away its house.
In a letter delivered last Tuesday to
Hartman, the board cited an April 12
incident in which a burning couch was
thrown off a third floor balcony of the
DU house as an indication of the
deeper problems facing the DUs.
In that incident, two members of
the DU house dragged a couch to the
third floor balcony. Despite instruc

tions from Hartman to stop, one of
the two lit the couch on fire and threw
it off the balcony. The individual re
sponsible for the act has been disas
sociated from the house. Hartman
said after the incident.
The board wrote Hartman that
since there were several members of
the fraternity present at the time of
the incident who were aware of the
intentions of the members, the action
was not individual.
However, Hartman wrote Galles
that the incident was the action of two
individuals and should not be
generalized to reflect the character of
the fraternity.
The IFC punished the entire frater
nity for "one guy's irresponsible act,"
Hartman said last night.
Disassociating the individual who
threw the couch off the DU balcony
from the fraternity indicates the re
sponsibility with which the DUs dealt
with the situation, Hartman wrote.
Galles, however, told The Daily
last week that "the DUs don't know
what collective responsibility means."
Calling it "a militant group that
wanted to see us gone," Hartman said
the board rendered an impartial deci
sion. In his letter, Hartman wrote that
in its summary of the facts concerning
the couch incident, the board claimed
that lighting furniture on fire and

throwing it off the roof of the DU
house is "a common source of amuse
ment of Delta Upsilon."
In addition, some board members
continuously referred to unrelated
events, such as a 1985 incident in
which the DUs flooded their house
after fraternity members did chin-ups
on water pipes in the house. Hartman
wrote.
According to the draft, if the IFC
president decides an appeal is war
ranted, he may ask the IFC to launch
another investigation.
Since he had not yet talked with
Galles, Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said he did not know what ef
fect the DUs' appeal would have on
the University's decision regarding
the future of the DUs as a recognized
fraternity. The University investiga
tion into the DUs is independent of
any IFC decision, he said.
