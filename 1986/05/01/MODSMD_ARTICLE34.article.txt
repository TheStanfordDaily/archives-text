Soviets ask Swedish medical aid
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Soviet officials have asked Sweden
if Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital is prepared to receive people sutter
ing radiation sickness from the Soviet nuclear plant accident, a hospital
spokeswoman said today.
Hospital spokeswoman Tania Blanck, quoting karolinska's professor
Jan Wersaall, said that Soviet officials had made inquiries yesterday.
" They did not specify how many victims they wished to send, nor what
type of radiation injuries they wanted help with," she said.
The Swedish government has said it is willing to help the Soviets. But
a spokesman said the issue of aiding victims of radiation sickness did not
come up at a meeting Wednesday between Foreign Ministry officials and
Soviet Ambassador Boris Pankin.
Indian police raid Golden Temple
AMRITSAR, India — Police raided the sacred Golden Temple yes
terday to capture militants who had declared a separate Sikh state. They
arrested about 200 people in a bloodless roundup, hut gunfire broke out
hours later and police said three people were wounded.
Witnesses said about 50 defiant Sikhs remained in the huge white
marble compound brandishing swords and vowing not to give in to the
elite Black Cat commandos, who are named for the black jump suits
they wear.
It was the first major intrusion on the temple, the holiest shrine of
Sikhdom, since soldiers stormed it in June 1984 to flush out heavily
armed extremists. More than 1,200 people were killed, and four months
later. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh members
of her personal guard.
Police gave no arrest figures yesterday, but reporters who watched
truckloads of Sikhs taken away early in the raid counted about 200.
Authorities said they would make a statement today.
A curfew was imposed in the area and paramilitary units were
deployed nearby.
A few militants and five spokesmen inside the temple complex
declared on Tuesday "the beginning of the battle for Khalistan, 1 ' the
name for the separate nation for India's 13 million Sikhs, and said a gov
ernment would be installed to function from the shrine.
They announced formation of a separatist militia and called for
recognition by the United States, Britain, Canada, Pakistan and other
countries.
Sources among Sikh militants said the five spokesmen, who have been
charged with sedition, slipped away before the raid. No arrests of top
separatist leaders were reported.
Mexico City jolted by earthquakes
MEXICO CITY — A series of earthquakes shook Mexico City early
yesterday, causing tall buildings to sway and sending hundreds of resi
dents — the memory of last year's devastating quakes fresh in their
minds — into the streets. No serious damage or injuries were reported.
The first quake began at 1:10 a.m., lasted about a minute and regis
tered 6 ; 5 on the Richter Scale in Mexico City, according to Mexican offi
cials. Two shorter, less intensive shocks occurred about an hour later.
However, the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the main
quake measured 7.0 on the Richter Scale. There was no immediate ex
planation for the disparity in Richter readings.
The epicenter was about 250 miles off Jalisco state on the Pacific
Coast, Mexican officials said.
The quakes also rocked the Pacific Coast states of Guerrero, Colima,
Jalisco and Michoacan, according to Red Cross officials in each state.
The area includes the cities of Acapulco and Puerto Vallarta.
The temblors were the strongest registered here since a pair of power
ful earthquakes stunned the capital last Sept. 19 and 20. Those quakes,
measuring 8.1 and 7.5 on the Richter Scale left at least 7,000 dead.
Libya expels European workers
LONDON — Libyan officials yesterday ordered 19 British citizens to
leave Libya, instructing five British companies operating in the country
to choose which employees to send home, the British Foreign Office an
nounced here.
"It was a totally arbitrary choice," a spokesman said. He added that
some of those being expelled had already left Libya.
At the same time, Tripoli ordered the expulsion of 36 employees of
Spanish companies operating in Libya, the Spanish Foreign Ministry
said.
It said the Spanish Embassy in Tripoli was trying to have the expulsion
order delayed at least until today.
Madrid business sources said 80 employees of the Spanish construc
tion company Ferrovial and electronics concern Boa were handed expul
sion notices Tuesday evening by Libyan police.
Forty-two Italians have also been ordered out of the country, the
Spanish ambassador in Tripoli said in a telephone interview.
Madrid sources called Tripoli's action revenge for the expulsion of 11
Libyans from Spain last week, following a Common Market decision to
reduce Libyan embassy staffs as an anti-terrorism measure.
Kenya cracks down on dissidents
NAIROBI. Kenya — In the harshest crackdown on political dissidents
in four years. 11 people have been sentenced to prison and 14 others ar
rested for involvement in a political organization that Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi says advocates "evil against the state."
The continuing arrests — and the sentencing of several defendants to
prison without access to legal counsel — mark the most aggressive gov
ernment action against its critics since an attempted coup was put down
in 1982.
Those imprisoned allegedly are members of an underground political
organization called Mwakenya (a Swahili acronym for Union of
Nationalists to Liberate Kenya) and have been convicted of possessing
or distributing "seditious" publications.
Moi, whose policies are never publicly criticized by local politicians or
the local press, has blamed Mwakenya on certain "bearded people,'' a
reference to intellectuals. Many dissidents held in jail have connections
with the country's universities, either as teachers or students.
Filipinos to seek U.S. assistance
BALL Indonesia — Citing "cobwebs of doubt" over President
Reagan's commitment to his government. Philippine Vicc President Sal
vador Laurel said he would seek direct assurance from Reagan, in a
meeting here today, that the president was fully behind President
Corazon Aquino.
Reagan's lengthy and highly publicized call Saturday to deposed Pres
ident Ferdinand Marcos fueled doubts in the Philippines that Reagan
had made the adjustment from his old friend and ally to the opposition
party now in power.
"Tomorrow I will get it straight from the horse's mouth." Laurel told
reporters.
At the same time, he said Marcos some day would be welcome to
return to his native village in the Philippines.
"We are not going to stop him from coming home." he said. "He is a
Filipino. We are just asking him to stay away a little while. When the
country is stabilized, and it won't take very long, he can come home."
Laurel said that Reagan's pledge'of $150 million in additional foreign
aid to the Philippines was "certainly not enough." and that he would
press U.S. officials for more help in recovering assets held by Marcos in
American banks.
