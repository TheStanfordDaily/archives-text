# Extent of Soviet damage still unknown
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The nuclear disaster in the
Soviet Union appeared to widen yesterday as intel
ligence data indicated that new problems have
arisen in a second reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear
complex, Reagan Administration sources said.
And, shattered by a violent explosion, the first
reactor may keep blazing for weeks because the
massive radiation in the plant makes an immediate
cleanup impossible, high-ranking U.S. officials said
in their first detailed public assessment of the acci
dent.
The radioactive cloud spawned by the explosion
covered a large part of Eastern and Northern
Europe yesterday, extending perhaps as far north
as the Arctic basin, and was drifting slowly across
the Soviet Union. But no dangerous levels of radio
activity were reported beyond Soviet borders.
"We are not at a point where we would feel there
are any health or environmental consequences for
the United States." said Lee Thomas, administra
tor of the Environmental Protection Agency, which
will increase its routine testing of air, water and
milk for radioactivity.
An Administration official with access to recent
intelligence reports said yesterday that the burning
reactor was "still spewing smoke" and radioactiv
ity.
Officials were uncertain about the nature ot the
problems in the second reactor, but one said that

"there is a possibility of a meltdown under way."
"From the outset, that has been a concern," one
source said.
However, while officials raised that possibility,
one later said only that the second reactor "might
be having problems" because it was "very close" to
the first unit.
The two Chernobyl reactors are in adjacent
buildings and apparently shared a common wall. In
addition, officials said, the units shared an electrical
generating facility.
The Soviet government, while reassuring its
citizens yesterday that the nuclear facility near Kiev
is under control, acknowledged that at least 197
people were injured in the accident in addition to
the two already reported killed.
Reporting that the radiation level at the Cher
nobyl nuclear plant in the Ukraine was falling, the
Soviet Council of Ministers said the damaged reac
tor "is shut down" and that "only 197 people were
hospitalized (and) 49 of them were discharged
from the hospital after a medical examination."
"Enterprises, collective farms and state farms
and institutions are functioning normally," the
council said.
Science attaches from 12 Western embassies met
at the U.S. Embassy yesterday morning to discuss
the accident, but the Soviet government continued
to reject the Western embassies' requests for addi

tional information on the nuclear disaster.
"We are being stonewalled," said one science at
tache after meeting with his colleagues. " I here are
many questions unanswered.
A spokesman for the British Embassy said that
his country was trying to evacuate about 70 British
students and tourists from Kiev and another 30
from Minsk, the capital of Soviet Byelorussia to the
north.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Jaroslav Verner said
he did not know how many Americans were travel
ing in the Ukraine, but the State Department
issued an advisory warning people to leave Kiev.
The State Department said there was no indication
of American casualties.
Unofficial sources continued to dispute the So
viet government's reports that there were only two
fatalities at Chernobyl. A Dutch amateur radio
operator who monitored a radio conversation in
the Soviet Union told the British Broadcasting
Corp. in London that the exchange disclosed that
many hundreds of people had been killed.
However, officials said that no authoritative
source has yet provided indications of casualties
caused by the explosion or the release of radiation.
Administration officials have scoffed at a Soviet
report that the massive accident at the plant caused
only two deaths.
