# Court extends discrimination ban
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme
Court, overturning a 21-year-old pre
cedent, ruled 7-2 yesterday that
prosecutors may not exclude blacks
from juries on the basis of race, and
gave defendants the right to immedi
ately challenge any effort to do so.
Until yesterday's ruling,
prosecutors enjoyed complete power
to remove a limited number of poten
tial jurors from a trial for any or no
reason. Their use of such peremptory,
or automatic, challenges could not be
questioned.
The court acted after years of com
plaints that a 1965 ruling. Swain vs.
Alabama, though condemning dis
crimination, continued to allow
prosecutors to fashion all-white juries
for black defendants.
In an unusual action, the author of
that ruling. Justice Byron White,
agreed with the decision to overturn
it."It appears," White said yesterday,
"that the practice of . . . eliminating
blacks from . . . juries in cases with
black defendants remains widespread
. . . so much so that I agree that an
opportunity (to protest such actions)
should be afforded when this occurs.
"I acree with the court that the

time has come to rule as it has, and I
join its opinion and judgment," he
said.
"Purposeful racial discrimination,"
Justice Lewis Powell Jr. wrote for the
majority, "violates a defendant's
right to equal protection because it
denies him the protection that a trial
by jury is intended to secure — "a
jury of his peers.
As a result of yesterday's decision
in Batson vs. Kentucky, a minority
defendant may now object if a prose
cutor uses automatic or discretionary
challenges to remove members of his
race from the jury. The prosecutor
will then have the burden of convinc
ing the judge that his reasons are not
racially motivated.
In addition, Powell said, the prose
cutor may not respond that he was
using "his intuitive judgment" that
the excuscd potential juror "would be
partial to the defendant because of
their shared race."
"Just as the Equal Protection
Clause forbids the states to exclude
black persons from (juries) on the as
sumption that blacks as a group are
unqualified to serve as jurors,"
Powell said, "so it forbids the states

to strike blacks (potential jurors) on
the assumption that they will be
biased in a particular case simply be
cause the defendant is black.
"The core guarantee of equal
protection, ensuring citizens that
their state will not discriminate on ac
count of race, would be meaningless
were we to approve the exclusion of
jurors on the basis of such assump
tions."
"Selection procedures that
purposefully exclude black persons
from juries undermine public confi
dence in the fairness of our system of
justice," Powell said, rejecting argu
ments by Kentucky and the Reagan
Administration to uphold the use of
prosecutors' powers.
Justice Thurgood Marshall, the
court's only black member, joined
Powell's "eloquent opinion," saying
it takes a "historic step toward elim
inating the shameful practice of racial
discrimination in the selection of
juries."
However, Marshall said the ruling
did not go far enough because, once
challenged, "any prosecutor can
easily assert . . . neutral reasons for
striking a juror, and trial courts are

ill-equipped to second-guess those
reasons."
Justice William Rehnquist, joined
by Chief Justice Warren Burger, dis
sented, saying the court's overruling
of Swain was "ill-considered and un
justifiable."
"In my view," Rehnquist said,
"there is simply nothing 'unequal'
about . . . using peremptory chal
lenges to strike blacks from the jury
in cases involving black defendants so
long as such challenges are also used
to exclude whites in cases involving
white defendants, Hispanics in cases
involving Hispanic defendants . . .
and so on."
Rehnquist said that "as long as
they are applied across the board to
jurors of all races and nationalities, I
do not see — and the court most cer
tainly has not explained — how their
use violates the Equal Protection
Clause."
Steve Ralston, an attorney with the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educa
tional Fund Inc., which lost the Swain
case, said yesterday's ruling will have
an important "prophylactic effect" in
ending widespread discrimination in
jury selection.

In addition, Powell said, the prose
cutor may not respond that he was
using "his intuitive judgment" that
the excuscd potential juror "would be
partial to the defendant because of
their shared race."
"Just as the Equal Protection
Clause forbids the states to exclude
black persons from (juries) on the as
sumption that blacks as a group are
unqualified to serve as jurors,"
Powell said, "so it forbids the states

to strike blacks (potential jurors) on
the assumption that they will be
biased in a particular case simply be
cause the defendant is black.
"The core guarantee of equal
protection, ensuring citizens that
their state will not discriminate on ac
count of race, would be meaningless
were we to approve the exclusion of
jurors on the basis of such assump
tions."
"Selection procedures that
purposefully exclude black persons
from juries undermine public confi
dence in the fairness of our system of
justice," Powell said, rejecting argu
ments by Kentucky and the Reagan
Administration to uphold the use of
prosecutors' powers.
Justice Thurgood Marshall, the
court's only black member, joined
Powell's "eloquent opinion," saying
it takes a "historic step toward elim
inating the shameful practice of racial
discrimination in the selection of
juries."
However, Marshall said the ruling
did not go far enough because, once
challenged, "any prosecutor can
easily assert . . . neutral reasons for
striking a juror, and trial courts are

ill-equipped to second-guess those
reasons."
Justice William Rehnquist, joined
by Chief Justice Warren Burger, dis
sented, saying the court's overruling
of Swain was "ill-considered and un
justifiable."
"In my view," Rehnquist said,
"there is simply nothing 'unequal'
about . . . using peremptory chal
lenges to strike blacks from the jury
in cases involving black defendants so
long as such challenges are also used
to exclude whites in cases involving
white defendants, Hispanics in cases
involving Hispanic defendants . . .
and so on."
Rehnquist said that "as long as
they are applied across the board to
jurors of all races and nationalities, I
do not see — and the court most cer
tainly has not explained — how their
use violates the Equal Protection
Clause."
Steve Ralston, an attorney with the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educa
tional Fund Inc., which lost the Swain
case, said yesterday's ruling will have
an important "prophylactic effect" in
ending widespread discrimination in
jury selection.
