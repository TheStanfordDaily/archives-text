No new contra aid vote
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's policy
in Central America suffered another setback yes
terday when House Republicans failed in an ef
fort to force a new vote May 12 on the issue of
military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
As a result, the House is unlikely to vote on the
aid issue until mid-June, and some Republicans
acknowledged yesterday that the president may
never get the military aid package he wants. If
the House does vote some kind of aid package in
June, it could falter in negotiations with the Sen
ate.
The Reagan Administration has said
repeatedly that the counterrevolutionary rebels,
known as contras, are in danger of being crushed
by Nicaragua's Sandinista government unless
they receive an immediate infusion of U.S. assis
tance.
House Republicans had hoped to gather 218
signatures — a majority of the House — on a
"discharge petition" that would have forced the
contra aid issue back to the House floor on May
1 2, the earliest possible date under the discharge
petition procedure. They had until yesterday to
achieve this for the May 12 target date, but fell
short.
The Republicans obtained only 159 signatures

of the 218 they needed, including the signatures
of seven Democrats. There are 182 Republicans
in the House.
Court abortion decision
WASHINGTON — In a setback for abortion
foes, the Supreme Court yesterday rejected an
attempt to reinstate an Illinois law that had
imposed a series of restrictions on physicians per
forming abortions.
The decision left intact a ruling by a federal ap
peals court in Chicago that struck down key
provisions of the law as unconstitutional.
But the justices' unanimous decision was based
on limited procedural grounds, reducing its im
pact. And another case testing the validity of a
similar law enacted in Pennsylvania remains on
the court's docket. A decision on that case is ex
pected by July.
Mayor's allies win race
CHICAGO — Luis Gutierrez and Marlene
Carter, the candidates allied with Mayor Harold
Washington in Tuesday's ward runoff elections,
collected 53 percent and 65 percent of the vote,

respectively, according to unofficial final figures
reported yesterday by the Chicago Board of
Elections.
In a hotly contested race for the 26th ward,
Gutierrez had 7,429 votes, compared to Manuel
Torres' 6,549. Torres was the choice of the Cook
County Democratic Party.
In the race for the 15th ward aldermanic seat,
Carter defeated incumbent Alderman Frank
Brady, 10,463-5,525.
The victories gave Mayor Washington the up
per hand in the City Council for the first time
since his election in 1983.
Stock drop biggest ever
NEW YORK — Stock prices plunged as waves
of selling programs battered the blue chips yes
terday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average
on its deepest one-day point dive in history.
But few sectors were spared in the sell-off and
broader market measures also finished with large
losses.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
tumbled 41.91 to 1,783.98. It was the biggest loss
in absolute terms for a single day, eclipsing the
old mark of 39.10 points on Jan. 8, 1986, when
the average fell to 1,526.61.
