New Walker testimony
SAN FRANCISCO — Confessed spy John
Walker testified yesterday he never told Jerry
Whitworth that the secrets Whitworth was al
legedly supplying about Navy code and commu
nications systems were being passed on to the So
viet Union.
"I never used the word Soviets' or Russians'
with Mr. Whitworth," Walker, the prosecution's
star witness against Whitworth. said at the end of
his third day of testimony .
Whitworth. 4f>. of Davis, is charged with fur
nishing secret documents about Navy code and
communications systems to Walker for
$332,000. knowing that Walker would relay the
information to the Soviet Union. Seven of the 13
charges against Whitworth cam potential life
sentences.
If the jury finds that Whitworth was unaware
of the destination of the secrets he allegedly
stole, he could be acquitted of the most serious
charges. However, the prosecution contends it
would be enough to prove that he knew the ma
terial would be used to harm the United States or

help another country.
Walker, who has admitted leading a Soviet
controlled espionage operation for 17 years, tes
tified earlier this week that when he recruited
Whitworth in 1974. he implied that the secret in
formation was being bought by Israel, the Mafia
or a British publication.
Walker said yesterday that Whitworth asked
six or seven times over the years who the buyer
was.
"I saw no point in telling him who the buyer
was as long as the material was flowing," Walker
said.
Governor endorses 51
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian formally endorsed the deep pockets ini
tiative yesterday and criticized Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley's "flip-flop" in opposing the
controversial June 3 ballot proposal to limit
liability judgments by California courts.
"I don't think the passage of (Proposition) 51

is going to solve the insurance problem. But it's a
major step in that direction. The passage of 51
(the deep pockets initiative) would help, so I am
supporting it. . . I'm endorsing Proposition 51,"
Deukmejian told a Capitol news conference.
The Republican governor added that Bradley,
his all-but-certain Democratic opponent for
governor this year, "stands alone" among Cali
fornia's big city mayors and other locally elected
officials opposing Proposition 51.
Deukmejian's endorsement of the deep pock
ets initiative was immediately condemned by No
on-51 campaign spokesman Harvey Rosenficld,
who said Deukmejian "has put himself at the
head of a long list of bureaucrats and politicians
who have been duped by the insurance industry's
multi-million dollar campaign."
