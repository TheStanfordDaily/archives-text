# Microdisc to be replaced by Bookstore

### KEVIN MONTAGUE Staff writer 
The Stanford Bookstore will take over
Stanford's discount computer sales this
summer, replacing the University
operated Microdisc program.
Microdisc, which stands for microcom
puter discount, is part of Information
Technology Services (ITS). According to
Bob Street, vice provost and dean for re
search and academic computing systems,
the Microdisc program was initiated hy the
University two-and-a-half years ago in or
der to make personal computers from Ap
ple. Hewlett-Packard and IBM available
to faculty and students at a discount.
However, University officials have

decided the program would be run more
efficiently by a business than a university.
"Stanford is not particularly adept at
running a business," 1 Street said. Although
the Microdisc program was not running
into financial difficulties, "It would be bet
ter off to put it in the hands of a business,"
he said.
Stanford is not equipped to run the
Microdisc program. Street added. "We're
a university. Money is not the issue."
According to the Stanford Bookstore,
the switch should not cause drastic changes
in the nature of the program or the price of
the computers. "We haven't yet defined
our plans," said Mac Anonuevo, of the
Bookstore. "We're still looking at differ
ent aspects," he added, saying that right

now all that existed were "At best, possi
bilities."
According to Anonuevo, the Bookstore
has just finished dealing with Apple and is
still waiting for IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
Speaking of the arrangement with Apple,
Anonuevo said that the Bookstore would
"try to keep (the computers) at the same
price" as Microdisc had. "It's hard to tell
right now," said Anonuevo.
Street expressed optimism about the
continued discounted price for the per
sonal computers. "The Bookstore is a non
profit organization." he said, adding that
just as Microdisc sold at cost plus handling,
so probably would the bookstore.
Street added that the first suggestion by
the University was that the Bookstore han

die the program from its inception, but
that Apple had objected, saying that it
would prefer Stanford handle it.
Although IBM and Hewlett-Packard
had no objection, the dissension of Apple
was enough to keep the Bookstore from
becoming the microcomputer vendor on
campus. For this reason, Stanford started
the Microdisc program, with Stanford
Procurement — which does the buying for
Stanford — handling the purchase of the
computers.
Microdisc will continue taking orders
until June 13 and will then shut down
operations. Orders will be filled until the
end of August, at which time all functions
