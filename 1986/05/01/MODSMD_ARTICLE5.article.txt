"I haven't seen one person who has
come for help not get an internship if they
really wanted one," says Bob Mathew, stu
dent director of Stanford-in-Government.
"Plus, now everyone is guaranteed a small
stipend."
A special fee assessment of more than
$20,000 awarded to SIG last spring has
enabled the voluntary student group to ex
pand its resources for public service and
find a permanent location in Owen House.

The money also allows SIG to award
five SIG fellowships instead of the usual
four. The award povides students the op
portunity to spend the summer in sub
stantive government internships and in
cludes a $ 1,000 stipend.
SIG is a non-partisan organization
which helps students find internships in
Washington. D.C., and elsewhere, by pro
viding information on available positions.
The group also runs an on-campus
speakers bureau and the Student Debate
Forum.

International terrorism, the implications
of "Star Wars," and Third World develop
ment will be a few of the issues discussed in
"Great Decisions 'K6" presented by the
public policy forum of SIG. "One of our
goals is to stimulate political discourse at
Stanford." Mathew said. "The forum and
dorm-based debates on domestic issues are
possible because of the endowments we
receive and fund-raising during the fall."
All students who have internships and
applvjor financial aid at SIG receive some
form of stipend, according to Mathew. "A

council decides how much to give, by the
student's financial need and his contribu
tion to public service at Stanford."
The five students awarded the fellow
ships receive scholarships from an endow
ment by Stanford alumnus Michael Huf
fington. The students — seniors Matthew
Bryza, Elizabeth Cheng and Samira
Kawash. junior Barry Porter and sopho
more Gary Rosen — were selected by a
joint faculty-student committee. Jhey
