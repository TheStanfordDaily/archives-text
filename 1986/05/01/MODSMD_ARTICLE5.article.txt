# SIG offers internships, scholarships

"I haven't seen one person who has
come for help not get an internship if they
really wanted one," says Bob Mathew, stu
dent director of Stanford-in-Government.
"Plus, now everyone is guaranteed a small
stipend."
A special fee assessment of more than
$20,000 awarded to SIG last spring has
enabled the voluntary student group to ex
pand its resources for public service and
find a permanent location in Owen House.

The money also allows SIG to award
five SIG fellowships instead of the usual
four. The award povides students the op
portunity to spend the summer in sub
stantive government internships and in
cludes a $ 1,000 stipend.
SIG is a non-partisan organization
which helps students find internships in
Washington. D.C., and elsewhere, by pro
viding information on available positions.
The group also runs an on-campus
speakers bureau and the Student Debate
Forum.

International terrorism, the implications
of "Star Wars," and Third World develop
ment will be a few of the issues discussed in
"Great Decisions 'K6" presented by the
public policy forum of SIG. "One of our
goals is to stimulate political discourse at
Stanford." Mathew said. "The forum and
dorm-based debates on domestic issues are
possible because of the endowments we
receive and fund-raising during the fall."
All students who have internships and
applvjor financial aid at SIG receive some
form of stipend, according to Mathew. "A

council decides how much to give, by the
student's financial need and his contribu
tion to public service at Stanford."
The five students awarded the fellow
ships receive scholarships from an endow
ment by Stanford alumnus Michael Huf
fington. The students — seniors Matthew
Bryza, Elizabeth Cheng and Samira
Kawash. junior Barry Porter and sopho
more Gary Rosen — were selected by a
joint faculty-student committee. Jhey
were chosen after receiving their in
ternships on the basis of the positions
they received and the quality of their
applications for the fellowship.
"A discouraging factor for most
students is the money it costs to spend
a summer in Washington. Students
should expect to spend about
$1,500," Mathew said. Last year,
however, SIG was able to help more
than 100 students obtain internships,
fellowships and summer housing in
Washington. Each spring, three SIG
members go to Washington to lobby
for students who have not received
internships at that time.

"After lobbying (this year), I've
heard that at least half of these stu
dents were offered positions,"
Mathew said.
Computers will be installed in the
SIG office for student use this year.
"Internships will be placed in the
computer and students can look for
something they like by just using the
Odyssey system," Mathew said. SIG
currently has more than 1,000 intern
ship listings.
"Students should start early in ap
plying for internships, around late fall
or early winter, and expect to put in
quite a bit of work," Mathew said.
"SIG is here for helping locate posi
tions, but our main goal is to make it
easier financially for all students to be
able to go."
