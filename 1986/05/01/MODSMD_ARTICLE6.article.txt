# Up close in South Africa

### GREGORY WEINGARTEN 
It is rare to meet a student on campus who can
tell you that he knows what South African living
conditions are like because he has been there and
seen them for himself.
Bill Cohn, a 1985 Stanford graduate, has done
just that. He travelled around South Africa from

Feature

July through November 1984. Yesterday, he talked
with students about his experiences there in Politi
cal Science Prof. David Abernethy's class entitled
Southern Africa: Race. History and Politics.
Cohn received a grant from the International Re
lations Department to do research in South Africa
for his honors thesis: "Influx Control and Black
Resistance in Apartheid South Africa."
According to Cohn. the trip gave him "a much
clearer understanding of the realities and dynamics
of social change in South Africa."
"I managed to get outside of the urban areas:
Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg," Cohn
said. In his attempt to see the "real South Africa,"
Cohn ventured into Sowetho with a black African
lawyer he had met while doing research in Johan
nesburg, getting a view of the township different
from "that of the typical tourist on a bus tour."
Cohn received a first-hand view of much of the
racial conflict which has affected South Africa in the
past few years.
According to Cohn, "the latest protracted
civil strife," began when he arrived in South
Africa in September 1984. "Since that time.
1,400-1,500 people have died." he said.
He included in this civil strife an Asian and
Coloured boycott of the referendum calling for
creation of a new parliamentary body for the
South Africa Asian and Coloured population by
the new constitution.
"South Africa was made ungovernable."
Cohn said, by Botha's strategy of "stepped-up
power of blacks in local city government in the
townships," included in the design of the new
constitution.
According to Cohn, this action escalated vio
lence against the township's city council mem
bers and police who were viewed by black South
Africans as enforcing apartheid's racist scheme.
Cohn also witnessed "the coming together of
organized labor and trade unions to show their
muscle," which manifested itself in the first le
gal black strike against the Anglo-American
Corporation.
In addition, Cohn cited the black student
boycott of Bantu education and the govern
ment's sending of South African defense troops
into the black townships for the first time as fur
ther developments in the escalation of conflict.
Cohn said his personal experiences in South
Africa were the greatest benefit of his voyage.
"Before (my trip), 1 considered myself socially
concerned with social relations," Cohn said.
"But more than anything it was human relations

which I made with people involved with the
struggle there that I value."
Cohn continues to take an active involvement
in the fight against apartheid. He spent last
summer lobbying in Washington. D.C.. "talking
to people on the hill and with lobbying groups."
in addition. Cohn maintains an active role in
the Stanford divestment movement. Divest-

Stanford doesn't

ment, according to Cohn, is the most con
structive way to promote non-violent change in
South Africa.
"In lieu of the referendum, it would show
Stanford doesn't respect student opinion if it
doesn't take action toward divestment," Cohn
said.
Currently, Cohn works at the Institute for
Food and Development Policy in San Francisco.
He hopes to receive a Fulbright grant to study
in Zimbabwe.
