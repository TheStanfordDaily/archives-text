# US-Israel relations analyzed at Branner
## 
### FELICIA PAIK Senior staff writer 
The "moral interest" and the "objective percep
tion" are the two main forces in the relationship
between the United States and Israel, two
specialists said yesterday in the Branner lounge.
1 he moral interest can be defined as the subjec
tive and ideological principles that the relationship
between the two countries is based on, according to
Nadav Safran, director of the Center for Middle
Eastern Studies at Harvard University, and Phillip
Wilcox, director of the Office of Israeli Affairs at
the State Department.
Safran, who has taught at Harvard for 30 years,
began the forum with a historical outline of there

lationship between the two countries since the in
ception of Israel in 1948.
He divided the development of the relationship
into two distinct stages. During the years from
1948 to 1967, America's interests in Israel were
founded on fundamental moral, ideological con
cerns. After 1967, the United States coupled these
with practical, strategic and military concerns.
The founding of Israel is similar to our own, he
said, and Wilcox concurred.
"It was founded by refugees and pioneers, like
the United States," Wilcox said. "We have a sub
jective and historical affinity with Israel."
The objective perception is the assessment of the
relationship between the two countries in terms of
Israel's role as a vital ally to the United States, Wil

cox said. It is reciprocal and resilient, despite the
fact that the United States is a greater power, he
said.
Several "institutionalized" factors exist in the re
lationship; strategic relations, a free-trade agree
ment, a sharing of an elaborate intelligence system
and an exchange of technology, Wilcox said.
The United States also will give $7 billion in aid
to Israel during 1985-86, including $1.5 billion in
emergency economic assistance.
Wilcox attributed the intimacy of the relation
ship to the successful, committed work of Israeli
and American diplomats.
"The Israelis have been effective in cultivating
U.S. officials and creating friendship and support.
They have an understanding of our governmental
system," said Wilcox.
