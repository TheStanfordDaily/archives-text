The Daily reported Tuesday that
Dennis Blake is president of the
United Stanford Workers. Tim
Johnson has been president since
January.
The Daily also reported Tuesday
that former Haitian President Fran
cois Duvalier held office until 1963.
In fact, he was president until his
death in 1971.
The Daily regrets the errors.
