Something got deep inside of me to tell me I'm not worth it... I don't deserve food, love, companionship . I
guess I feel like other people s needs are more important, and that if I need something, I might be taking it away
from theirs. "
— Nicole, age 23
"The sicker and weaker I got. the easier it was to control my feelings I didn t have the energy to get angry
— Greg, age 20
"No kid is going to go home and say. This family has problems, we've got to talk about this Anorexia is just an
extreme way of dealing with a lot of things that happen when you re growing up
— Evi, a recovered anorexic
"It's a life process learning that you re a worthwhile human being — that you can trust yourself and trust other
people That's the real recovery
— Kathy
