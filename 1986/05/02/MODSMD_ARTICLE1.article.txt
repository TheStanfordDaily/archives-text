# C-IR will call on Stanford to divest
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Investment
Responsibility (C-IR) will recom
mend today that the University divest
itself of over $4 million of stock in
two companies and will ask three
companies to halt sales to the South
African military and police, according
to a member of C-IR.
C-IR has called for the complete
divestment of University stock from
Diamond Shamrock Petroleum ($3.5
million) and Schumberger Corpora
tion ($454,000), according to senior
Joel Bellenson, a C-IR member.
The requests are related to both
companies' business activities in
South Africa, he said.
"What we've done is to acknowl
edge that the companies are doing
harm in South Africa. Our support of
the resolutions puts real pressure on
the trustees to act," he said.
The 12-member University com
mittee is an advisory group of stu
dents, faculty, staff and alumni.
C-IR also recommended that the
Board of Trustees exercise its
proxy votes in favor of stockholders'
resolutions asking the Ford Corpora
tion, Texaco Oil and Mobil Oil to
stop selling supplies and equipment
to the South African military and one
of its suppliers, the South Africa
Arms Company, Bellenson said.
According to numbers published
by Stanford Out of South Africa,
Stanford holds $9.4 million of Ford
stock, $315,000 of Texaco stock and
$992,000 of Mobil stock.
The resolutions originated with
other stockholders, according to Poli
tical Science Prof. Richard uiody, C
IR chairman. The trustees do not
draft
said.
The recommendations were made
at C-l√ü's weekly meeting yesterday
and will h delivered today to a trus
tee subc mmittee, the Special Com
mission on Investment Responsibility
(S-C Brody said.
. e is likely to act on the recom
mendations at the May 12 meeting,
he said. The special commission will
review the recommendations and
decide if any should be considered by
the full board.
Brody did not wish to elaborate on
the commission's decisions. "It would
be inappropriate to release specific
information at this time," he said,
adding that S-CIR should see the
recommendations first.
Bellenson spoke to The Daily
despite what he called a "gag order'
on commission members asking that
information not be released.
"Keeping information secret is
damentally undemocratic; con
stituencies need to be able to respond
to decisions," Bellenson said.
Brody said that members of C-IR
were not instructed to refrain from
commenting on yesterday's meeting.
"We were going to discuss that, but
we ran out of time," he said.
Bellenson said C-IR has made a
number of decisions in recent weeks
that constitute a "change in posture."
In the past three weeks, the com
mission has "voted in favor of proxy
resolutions calling for three compan
ies to pull out of South Africa and
have supported divestment of New
mont Mining stock in addition to
what we will recommend (today)," he
said.
The three companies, all in the
University's portfolio, are American
Home Products, Morgan Guarantee
Bank and Manufacturers Hanover.
