# Alpha Delts to sponsor track meet for disabled
## 
### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
In conjunction with the United Cerebral Palsy Asso
ciation, the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity will be holding a
track and field meet for disabled athletes at Stanford
Stadium this Sunday.
"This is not a Special Olympics," according to event
co-director Andrew Norris, a senior and member of
the fraternity.
We are not trying to raise money for the athletes
themselves. We are giving them the chance to compete
on a regional level," he said. "This is a qualifying meet.
Those who perform well on Sunday will have the op
portunity to compete in a national meet to be held
sometime this summer, probably in August."
The upcoming meet promises to be highly competi
tive, according to Norris. The athletes compete in one
of seven categories depending upon their abilities.
The meet is not strictly for athletes with cerebral
palsy, the congenital disease which attacks the nervous
system and can severely damage motor abilities, Norris
said.
" Anybody can compete in his own class. There's a
variety including quadriplegic athletes to those who
use hand crutches. We're expecting 30 Bay Area com
petitors this year," he said.
"Last year there was a guy competing who couldn't

move any part of his body except his left foot," said
fraternity member Lawrence Robinson, who is helping
plan the event. "His determination and competitive
spirit were great. His disability didn't stop him."
The Alpha Delts have been planning the meet since
January. The UCPA recruits the athletes, and"the fra
ternity does the rest," according to Norris.
The Alpha Delts have raised $3,000 through alumni
contributions to cover the cost of food, transportation,
T-shirts and medals for the athletes.
Both Norris and Robertson agreed that University
support for the project has been encouraging. "Last
year the two co-directors of the event won the Deans
Service Award for their efforts," Norris said. "The
University was quite excited about the meet."
Races begin at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday. Admission is
free, and all events are open to the public. The Stan
ford gymnastics team will be performing during the
lunch break, and a local band "Hard to Handle" has
volunteered to perform immediately following the last
competitions.
"It is important for people to come to this,"
Robertson said. "The main thing we want is to have
students see athletes like the guy who can move only
his left foot. I think that was the best day I spent at
Stanford last year, as far as learning goes."
"I think that the meet is a great example of the po
tential for human success," Norris added. "We hope to
get a lot of spectators this year."
