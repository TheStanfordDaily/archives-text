## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Waldheim's cloudy past 
### 
What was Kurt Waldheim doing when millions of
Jews were being shipped like cattle to Auschwitz to be
exterminated?
Where was Waldheim, the former U.N. general sec
retary who is now a candidate for the May 4 presiden
tial election in Austria, when Yugoslav partisan
hostages were being murdered?
Waldheim claims that, "I had nothing whatsoever to
do with all of this." But his past seems to be steeped in
ambiguities. Up to now, he has denied that he served in
any capacity other than clerk and interpreter during
World War 11. He says that he was just doing his duty.
However, recent information shows that Waldheim's
duties may have involved more than he lets on. For
merly he had denied any service in Yugoslavia during
the war. Now, after being attacked with accusations
about his past, he admits that he was present in Yugos
lavia and Greece during those years and that he was a
G-2 officer to a convicted war criminal. Yet, he still
claims to know nothing of what was going on.
It all seems a little too fishy.
On top of these vague stories, The Washington Post
reports that in 1948 the U.N. War Crimes Commission
recommended that Waldheim "should be delivered up
for trial" on charges that he was involved in "putting
hostages to death."
Says Waldheim: "What I am accused of are lies."
But he has made no efforts to set the record straight.
There presently exists no proof that Waldheim was
involved in wartime atrocities. However, the
Waldheim case has caused many to go into a frenzy
about figuring out this man. In the United States, the
reaction to Waldheim has been extreme: The Justice
Department unit that investigates Nazi war criminals
has urged that Waldheim be banned from entering this
country.
Certainly, mention of the Holocaust or of Nazi Ger
many stirs great emotion and plays on intense sen
sitivities. The "never forget" attitudes are present; the
weight of the not-too-distant past is heavy. The horror
and inhumanity of that time are too unthinkable to let
slip into the recesses of the mind. When something like
the Waldheim ordeal touches a nerve, people react.
The reaction to Waldheim's candidacy has proven
that the sensitivity to the atrocities of the second World
War are powerful. It is a good thing that the wounds

have not healed, that they remain fresh. The Waldheim
case seems to have poured a little salt into them.
The World Jewish Congress, the U.S. Justice De
partment and others who have been assertive in the
campaign to expose Waldheim's past should not feel
timid. Their work ascertains that the bitter memories
of that time period are alive.
Certainly, these memories are alive in Austria,
where it seems that Waldheim's unclear past has
helped to make him the more popular candidate in the
race. Rather than harming his campaign, the dis
closures about Waldheim have caused the Austrians to
rally around him and assert a new feeling of
nationalism.
"We Austrians will choose whom we want," it says
boldly on Waldheim's campaign poster. Indeed, this is
the case. On Sunday the Austrians will choose the
image they want to portray to the rest of the world.
They themselves may be the ones to choose a leader
who causes other countries to accept him with reluc
tance. They may choose a leader who has hidden his
past from the Austrians and the rest of the world for
the last 40 years.
"Let the new generation live without hearkening
back to the past" was the sentiment evident in last
year's Bitburg visit by President Reagan. It seems in
congruous that the Austrians would want to move into
the future with a man who could very well be a throw
back to the past. It seems strange.
It is justified that the United States is wary of the
"strangeness" surrounding the Waldheim election.
The mere fact that Waldheim's personal history is so
vague and could be tied to hideous wartime activities is
reason for the United States to be skeptical. The
Justice Department's move to completely ban him
from entering this country seems a bit harsh, especially
since nothing has been proven against him and the re
lationship between the United States and Austria is a
friendly one. If Waldheim wins the election, it would
be suitable to allow him entry into the United States on
official business only. All other visits should be
banned. _
As The New York Times columnist Flora Lewis put
it, the Austrians will choose, "the hand they offer to
the world." Unfortunately, it is the hand of a "mystery
man," and people may not want to shake it.
