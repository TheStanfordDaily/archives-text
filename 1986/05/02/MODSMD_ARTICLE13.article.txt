## Force trustees to listen 
### 
'in light of recent events, this is meant to clarify the posi
tion and strategy of Stanford Out of South Africa (SOS A)
with regard to the anti-apartheid movement at Stanford.
Primarily, we wish to discuss the upcoming Board of Trus
tees meeting on May 12 and 13 and SOSA's recent ac
tions concerning it.
On Wednesday, April 23 we moved the shanties from
White Plaza to the Inner Quad in front of University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy's office while the administration
was setting the agenda for the May trustees meeting. We
felt it was necessary to provide a visible presence to em-

SOSA

phasize the importance of addressing the divestment issue
at the upcoming meeting, since this will be the last time
this academic year that divestment can be considered by
the board.
This action was taken in hopes that the trustees will act
in accordance with the two-thirds majority vote of the stu
dent body to totally divest from corporations doing busi
ness in South Africa under the racist apartheid regime.
The three demands that we are making are very basic and
simple and have been stated in an open letter to the Office
of the President. Our goals are such:
• That total divestment be placed on the agenda of the
May meeting and that the trustees vote on the matter.
• That the trustees issue a definitive statement on their
policies on the issue of total divestment coming out of the
May meeting.
• That the May Board of Trustees meeting be open to the
public, given the very public nature of the issue being ad
dressed.
In other words, SOSA is simply requesting that the
trustees address the issue of divestment, make a decision
on the issue and allow students to observe this portion of
the meeting. While we understand that trustee meetings
are traditionally closed, there is a great precedent at uni

versities across the nation, from Smith College to UC-
Berkeley, for opening meetings when issues concerning
the whole community are being discussed. If the tmstees
are willing to give the student-supported divestment ref
erendum the due democratic process it deserves, then we
will remove the shanties from their position in front of
Building 10.
But shanties are only part of SOSA's effort to bring
the trustees to face the issue of total divestment. In addi
tion to encouraging residences and dorms to join us in
building shanties, we are also supporting the upcoming
Human Rights Forum with Kennedy on May 9, which will
allow members of the Stanford community to confront the
administration about concerns they have about human
rights issues. This kind of open dialogue and communica
tion is what we see as the most desirable way to bring
about change here at Stanford, and we wish that the meth
ods like forums, letter writing campaigns and student
referendums had enough impact to convince the trustees
to give the issue of total divestment the importance that it
merits. In addition, on May 12, the first day of the May
trustee meeting, there will be a coalition rally and cross
cultural celebration at the shantytown, involving the
Black Student Union (BSU), SOSA, MEChA, the Asian
American Students Association (AASA), the ASSU Sen
ate, the Council of Presidents, Sanctuary at Stanford, the
Stanford Native American organization, the student body
and the faculty. Through speakers, song, poetry and art,
we wish to express our solidarity in working toward the
elimination of discrimination against all peoples — and
specifically remind the trustees that they have a responsi
bility to respond to the student mandate for divestment.
Hopefully, this has clarified SOSA's position in the
anti-apartheid movement at Stanford. Like the BSU, the
AASA and other organizations urging divestment, SOSA
is only trying to ensure that the student body's position is
heard and responded to by the trustees and the adminis
tration.
