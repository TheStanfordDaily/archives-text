Pitfalls of science
You don't have to be a scientific
genius to know that it was lousy judg
ment to allow all those fine lives and
billions of dollars to depend on those
flimsy O-rings, in the case of the
shuttle Challenger, especially since
warnings had been sounded by
various experts. It was even lousier
judgment to risk so many more lives
and whole regions of the earth on a
flimsy cooling pipe, in the case of
Chernobyl. Again, lots of warnings
had been sounded over the years.
But some people never learn about
judgment: they believe fanatically in
numbers, gadgets, their ability to con
trol life with science and technology.
It seems likely that they have not read
writers such as Montesquieu, Goethe,
Poe, Baudelaire, Svevo who foresaw
disastrous consequences of this arro
gant and foolish human bent.
Of course, science has brought im
measurable benefit to mankind. But
one knows instinctively that there is a
right dosage in these matters, a
healthy balance between judgment
and technology. It is that balance
which was violated in the two tragic

instances. It is the excessive belief in
science that is dangerous: that was
evident in Nazi Germany and is
clearly the case in the Soviet Union.
Robert Greer Cohn

Scared in Berlin
We are scared. We are two
Americans living in Berlin — two
blocks and five blocks from the La
Belle Disco to be exact — and we are
confused about the events that are
taking place around us. Our fear is so
great, in fact, that one of us has
decided to leave Berlin in two days.
President Reagan claims that he at
tacked Libya in order to combat in
ternational terrorism. Yet, we feel no
safer as a result of the attack than we
did beforehand. Actually, we feel
quite vulnerable, and in turn very up
set that we have been forced into this
uncomfortable situation by our gov
ernment, acting for our own
"protection."
In the aftermath of the attack we
feel more subject to the threats of

Libyan or Arab terrorists, who, more
likely than not, have been provoked
rather than deterred by such an at
tack. Moreover, we are subject to the
threat of German protesters who
have been seized with anti-American
sentiments.
We find it difficult to blame them.
Germany is supposedly one of our
closest allies. As a matter of fact, we
have approximately 250,000 soldiers
stationed in West Germany. So it is
not surprising that they feel outraged
when the United States attacks an
other nation without heeding their
advice. Nor is it surprising that they
conclude that the United States views
NATO as a military alliance created
to carry out the United States' foreign
policy.
We do not believe that problems
can be solved through violence. Men
like Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy live for such a possibility —
to put the United States to shame in
the eyes of the world. Playing his
game we can only lose. We feel this
problem can only be solved through
negotiations or economic sanctions —
military action can only intensify ter
rorism, embitter the nations involved

and in a macrocosmic sense, make a
real solution more difficult to
achieve. In the meantime, Americans
like us are scared and hope that the
Administration will change the
foreign policy which puts us so heav
ily at risk.
