# Leave Sandinistas alone

### 
Amid the uproar over Libya, Nicaraguan issues have
been lost in the shuffle. But President Reagan is still fight
ing for congressional support for the contras — fighting to
keep at bay the "red tide lapping at our Southern border,"
as he so quaintly put it.
Among the worst fallout from the war in Nicaragua is,
in my opinion, the lack of intelligent debate about it in this
country. Reagan's warnings of the communist threat
posed by the Sandinistas make it into a typical threat for
the' Bos: all hype and no substance. And although Admin
istration critics who argue that Nicaragua is our new Viet
nam make a useful point, it seems that they are skipping
over what the real issues are.

People, in general, either argue that yes, the contras can
win, so we should help them. Or no, they cant, so we
shouldn't. How many people stand up and say "pardon
me — the Sandinistas came to power with an overwhelm
ing popular mandate — in 1984 they won the freest elec
tions in Nicaragua's history — the Nicaraguan govern
ment is legitimate, and we have no right to overthrow it."
I think that more people would argue that if they knew the
whole story and weren't bombarded by the propaganda
coming from the White House. It is first important to bet
ter understand the revolution itself, and second to take it
out of the Cold War framework, and examine it in the
light of U.S.-Central American relations. The Nicaraguan
revolution has far less impact on East-West relations than
Reagan would like the public to think.
U.S. media give the impression that the Sandinista gov
ernment is a Soviet-controlled, radical, communist, ex
pansionist dictatorship, and that it is the duty of the
United States to save Nicaragua for democracy. Well, let's
look at Nicaraguan history for a moment. From 1933 until
1979, the United States supported the anti-communist
Somoza dynasty. The Somozas ran Nicaragua as corpor
ate executives would run a corporation and did just about
anything to turn a profit. They controlled 20 percent of
the economy and used the U.S.-armed and trained Na
tional Guard as a personal army to enrich the family and
its cronies through extortion, harassment and terror. The
vast majority of the population lived in extreme poverty.
Nicarguan revolutionaries had been active since the
'30s, but began to gain popularity during the '70s. The
eventual triumph of the Sandinistas was due to their mass
popular support, the coalition they forged with the middle
class during the years in which even successful business
men became fed up with Anastasio Somoza's appalling
corruption, and the last-minute withdrawal of U.S. sup
port for Somoza.
The Sandinistas came to power committed to a non
aligned foreign policy, a "mixed economy" (means of pro
duction were owned mostly by the private sector while
economic policy was subject to control by the central gov
ernment) and political pluralism. From 1979 to 1981,
they proved their commitment by going to the United
States and Western Europe, not to the Soviet Union, for
arms. They made numerous concessions to the business

interests because they understood well that a stable
country depended on a healthy economy, and that a
healthy economy needed capitalist investment. They not
only tolerated opposition — they institutionalized it. The
cabinet and national bureaucracy includes people from
many different political parties, and they are not simply
window-dressing; their input makes a difference.
So what went wrong? Toward the end of the Carter Ad
ministration a conservative attitude was on the rise in
Congress, and the Senate blocked economic aid to
Nicaragua, while the United States turned down military
aid entirely and pressured its Western allies to do the
same. Then Reagan came to power in 1981. He saw
Nicaraguan radicalism as part of an international Soviet
plot. Since then the Sandinistas have been under siege
by the U.S.-backed contras, and by the middle class
politicans inside the government who feel cheated out of
the gains of the revolution. They have imposed a state of
emergency and have been grappling with an already weak
economy now aggravated by a brutal war. They have
turned increasingly toward the Soviet Union for military
and economic aid — they have had very little choice.
Let's look at the situation logically. A socialist
Nicaragua poses no economic threat. The Nicaraguans
were more than willing to have ties with the United States,
and no socialization of multi-national corporations ever
threatened U.S. business interests. It also poses no mili
tary threat. The Sandinistas, even now, have not formed
military ties with the Soviet Union, and have never shown
the slightest inclination to allow the Soviets to base troops
or weapoas on Nicaraguan soil.
Nicaragua is hardly a Soviet client state — the Soviet
Union has its hands full with Cuba and has paid little real
diplomatic attention to Nicaragua.
And to say the United States supports freedom and
democracy in Nicaragua is a farce. The Somozas were
among the most corrupt, totalitarian and inhumane dic
tators in history.
The fact of the matter is that the United States simply
can't stand to have lost control over Nicaraguan policies —
a control that had been enjoyed by the United States since
the late 19th century. A decline in the traditional U.S.
hegemony in Central America may mean a decline in in
ternational prestige, and if ever there was an Administra
tion that cares about perceptions abroad of U.S. power,
it's this one.
So if current U.S. policy drives the Sandinistas more
and more into the arms of the Soviets, Reagan really
doesn't care. The important thing is to show the rest of the
countries in the region: "Don't even think about revolu
tion — this could happen to you."
The United States should stop supporting the contras,
and should negotiate a peace within the contadora
framework. Everyone seems to blame Nicaragua all the
time for the peace talks breaking down, and yet a few
years ago, the Sandinistas signed a draft treaty in despera
tion to put an end to the conflict. The United States pres
sured its Latin American allies not to sign, because one of
the provisions in the treaty was the removal of all foreign
military presence in the region. Reagan will never agree to
that — it would mean a further decline in U.S. leverage.
U.S. policy makers, as citizens of a country founded on
principles of freedom, claim to advocate national self
determination. They should stop simply saying it, and
start meaning it.

Amid the uproar over Libya, Nicaraguan issues have
been lost in the shuffle. But President Reagan is still fight
ing for congressional support for the contras — fighting to
keep at bay the "red tide lapping at our Southern border,"
as he so quaintly put it.
Among the worst fallout from the war in Nicaragua is,
in my opinion, the lack of intelligent debate about it in this
country. Reagan's warnings of the communist threat
posed by the Sandinistas make it into a typical threat for
the' Bos: all hype and no substance. And although Admin
istration critics who argue that Nicaragua is our new Viet
nam make a useful point, it seems that they are skipping
over what the real issues are.

People, in general, either argue that yes, the contras can
win, so we should help them. Or no, they cant, so we
shouldn't. How many people stand up and say "pardon
me — the Sandinistas came to power with an overwhelm
ing popular mandate — in 1984 they won the freest elec
tions in Nicaragua's history — the Nicaraguan govern
ment is legitimate, and we have no right to overthrow it."
I think that more people would argue that if they knew the
whole story and weren't bombarded by the propaganda
coming from the White House. It is first important to bet
ter understand the revolution itself, and second to take it
out of the Cold War framework, and examine it in the
light of U.S.-Central American relations. The Nicaraguan
revolution has far less impact on East-West relations than
Reagan would like the public to think.
U.S. media give the impression that the Sandinista gov
ernment is a Soviet-controlled, radical, communist, ex
pansionist dictatorship, and that it is the duty of the
United States to save Nicaragua for democracy. Well, let's
look at Nicaraguan history for a moment. From 1933 until
1979, the United States supported the anti-communist
Somoza dynasty. The Somozas ran Nicaragua as corpor
ate executives would run a corporation and did just about
anything to turn a profit. They controlled 20 percent of
the economy and used the U.S.-armed and trained Na
tional Guard as a personal army to enrich the family and
its cronies through extortion, harassment and terror. The
vast majority of the population lived in extreme poverty.
Nicarguan revolutionaries had been active since the
'30s, but began to gain popularity during the '70s. The
eventual triumph of the Sandinistas was due to their mass
popular support, the coalition they forged with the middle
class during the years in which even successful business
men became fed up with Anastasio Somoza's appalling
corruption, and the last-minute withdrawal of U.S. sup
port for Somoza.
The Sandinistas came to power committed to a non
aligned foreign policy, a "mixed economy" (means of pro
duction were owned mostly by the private sector while
economic policy was subject to control by the central gov
ernment) and political pluralism. From 1979 to 1981,
they proved their commitment by going to the United
States and Western Europe, not to the Soviet Union, for
arms. They made numerous concessions to the business

interests because they understood well that a stable
country depended on a healthy economy, and that a
healthy economy needed capitalist investment. They not
only tolerated opposition — they institutionalized it. The
cabinet and national bureaucracy includes people from
many different political parties, and they are not simply
window-dressing; their input makes a difference.
So what went wrong? Toward the end of the Carter Ad
ministration a conservative attitude was on the rise in
Congress, and the Senate blocked economic aid to
Nicaragua, while the United States turned down military
aid entirely and pressured its Western allies to do the
same. Then Reagan came to power in 1981. He saw
Nicaraguan radicalism as part of an international Soviet
plot. Since then the Sandinistas have been under siege
by the U.S.-backed contras, and by the middle class
politicans inside the government who feel cheated out of
the gains of the revolution. They have imposed a state of
emergency and have been grappling with an already weak
economy now aggravated by a brutal war. They have
turned increasingly toward the Soviet Union for military
and economic aid — they have had very little choice.
Let's look at the situation logically. A socialist
Nicaragua poses no economic threat. The Nicaraguans
were more than willing to have ties with the United States,
and no socialization of multi-national corporations ever
threatened U.S. business interests. It also poses no mili
tary threat. The Sandinistas, even now, have not formed
military ties with the Soviet Union, and have never shown
the slightest inclination to allow the Soviets to base troops
or weapoas on Nicaraguan soil.
Nicaragua is hardly a Soviet client state — the Soviet
Union has its hands full with Cuba and has paid little real
diplomatic attention to Nicaragua.
And to say the United States supports freedom and
democracy in Nicaragua is a farce. The Somozas were
among the most corrupt, totalitarian and inhumane dic
tators in history.
The fact of the matter is that the United States simply
can't stand to have lost control over Nicaraguan policies —
a control that had been enjoyed by the United States since
the late 19th century. A decline in the traditional U.S.
hegemony in Central America may mean a decline in in
ternational prestige, and if ever there was an Administra
tion that cares about perceptions abroad of U.S. power,
it's this one.
So if current U.S. policy drives the Sandinistas more
and more into the arms of the Soviets, Reagan really
doesn't care. The important thing is to show the rest of the
countries in the region: "Don't even think about revolu
tion — this could happen to you."
The United States should stop supporting the contras,
and should negotiate a peace within the contadora
framework. Everyone seems to blame Nicaragua all the
time for the peace talks breaking down, and yet a few
years ago, the Sandinistas signed a draft treaty in despera
tion to put an end to the conflict. The United States pres
sured its Latin American allies not to sign, because one of
the provisions in the treaty was the removal of all foreign
military presence in the region. Reagan will never agree to
that — it would mean a further decline in U.S. leverage.
U.S. policy makers, as citizens of a country founded on
principles of freedom, claim to advocate national self
determination. They should stop simply saying it, and
