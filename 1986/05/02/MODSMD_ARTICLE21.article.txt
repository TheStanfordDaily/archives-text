## Havin' some fun with 'Late Night' 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
I don't know why activists spend
so much of their time complaining
about wars and racism when "Late
Night with David Letterman" con
tinues to broadcast nightly.
Sure, it's a good idea to give
people of all races a role in their
own government and to encourage
them not to kill each other while
they're upholding democracy or
somnambulism or emulsifiers or
whatever.
But once they've done all that
and they start eating soy lecithin
and dressing like Mr. Roper, I

don't want to be the one who has
to tell them that the only thing to
do between 12:30 and 1:30 a.m. in
our culture is watch some guy tell
one-size-fits-all jokes and flirt
with Paul I'm-On-More-Drugs-
Than-You-Are Schaeffer, his ef
feminate gerbil of a band leader.
/ don't want to be responsible
for starting World War 111.
You're probably thinking I
should be exiled to Chula Vista for
not bowing down in collegiate
worshipfulness before the swami
of sarcasm, the Garanimals guru,
the great God King Bufu of
everyman ennui, like the rest of
the undergraduate population of
this country does every night over
their 2.3 pieces of cardboard
pizza.
Maybe I'm just a jealous, petty
little excuse for a humor columnist
who envies some guy with a bigger

audience than mine (and a bigger
salary, and a bigger staff of writers
and a bigger gap between his front
teeth). But 1 don't think so.
You've gotta feel a little sorry
for a guy who has to bring on
parakeets dressed as the Beatles
and trained to squawk the melody
of "Yellow Submarine" to get a
laugh, though.
At least Stupid Pet Tricks are
better than his monologue.
First he stands awkwardly in
front of the camera and pulls at
the closure of his sport coat for a
while, then remembers to smile
and show everyone the space be
tween his teeth.
You're so relieved when he fi
nally says something that you
laugh hilariously at it. Of course, it
isn't funny, but it's probably the
best you're going to hear for the
next hour or so, unless they run a
Cal Worthington commercial
during station break.
When each of his remaining
jokes falls flat he just regurgitates
the punch line from that first one,
like a happy Hereford. "Yep,
Chula Vista, a virtual resort
mecca."
If that doesn't work, he flashes
some more bad orthodontia and
intones, "Boy, we're having some
fun now." He says this a lot, but
I'm not convinced.
I've figured out that Letterman
must have been a DU in college.
Just think about his fetish for fake
fireplaces and dropping things off
tall buildings.
Either that or he always wanted
to be David Horowitz. "Let's see
here, now. It says this watermelon
makes a lovely napalm salad. Let's
just test that one out."
Oh well, at least he's funnier
than the Far Side.
I'll admit that they're funny, but
anything that gets reprinted on
Hum Bio lecture notes and wal
lpapers dorm doors is just a little
rampant.
No, I like Dave; I'd recommend
him for important posts of respon
sibility â€” like live-in comic at a
Russian nuclear power plant.
