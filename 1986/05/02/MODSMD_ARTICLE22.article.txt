# Engineers beaming with pride after win

You win some, you lose some.
That's probably what Stanford juniors Kristen
Meier and Lori Adams were thinking after compet
ing in a design contest last weekend as part of an
annual gathering of the West Coast chapters of the
American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).
A steel and concrete beam designed by the two
engineers took first place in one contest, but in an
other contest Stanford's entry in a concrete canoe
race sank.
West Coast colleges active in the society entered
projects designed by their chapters in two contests
held at the University of Nevada-Reno. Schools
that were represented included Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis and San Jose
State.

One contest consisted of applying a load to the
center of beams measuring six-feet-by-four-inches
by-six-inches, constructed of steel and concrete in
accordance with certain building specifications.
Two beams were designated winners: the beam
that broke under the load closest to that predicted
by its designers to be destructive, and the beam that
withstood the most force before breaking.
Stanford's entry in the beam contest broke under
a load of 7,200 pounds, only 400 pounds more than
Meier's and Adams' predicted breaking point of
6,800 pounds. This was the smallest margin be
tween predicted and actual breaking point of any
beam in the contest
"We were really unsure because we'd never dealt
with concrete before," Meier said. "It's a trade-off
because you don't know how much steel to use or
how strong the concrete is."
"We'd just taken this class. Design in Steel and

Reinforced Concrete," she explained, "and we
were put in charge of (creating the beam)." Mem
bers of their chapter of the ASCE chose the two to
design the beam.
In the other half of the beam contest, Berkeley's
beam proved the strongest, not giving way until its
load reached 19,200 pounds.
In a second test of engineering skill, each chapter
created concrete canoes that competed in races on
Washoe Lake. Stanford's canoe sank in its first
race, and was not recovered.
Meier said that extenuating factors in the failure
were the windy weather and the fact that Stanford
put only a short amount of time into creating its
canoe. *£***,
Stanford designed and built its canoe in, one
month, and Meier said she judged by the appear
ance of some other school's canoes that several
months had gone into their creation.
