# Diversions
## The 						bouquet, the tannin, and, ah, those long legs 
### JEFFREY MATZMAN, CHRISTY MIDDLETON JOHN SAGE 
These are the final articles in a two
part series on Napa Valley.
Now that spring is here, what bet
ter way to spend a sunny weekend
than up in Napa Valley tasting some
the finest wines available?
Dotted along scenic Highway 29
between Napa and Calistoga are
countless wineries open to the public.
Most wineries offer tasting rooms and
many offer free tours of their wine
making facilities. In addition, many of
the smaller wineries will be happy to
arrange tours or tastings by advance
reservation.

Part of the beauty of Napa Valley
wine tasting is to simply explore it on
ones own. The valley is ideally suited
for exploration by car, moped or
bike. Most of the wineries can be
spotted from Highway 29 and the val
ley is less than 30 miles long. It seems
that at every turn of the road there is
a score of fresh tasting opportunities.
When tasting, don't be afraid to ask
for advice from the tasting-room
pourer. They are more than ac
customed to tourists asking for help.
A good place to start your tasting is at
the Robert Mondavi Winery just
north of Yountville at Oakville Grade
Road.
Mondavi offers a 30-minute es
corted tour through their vineyards,
processing plant, aging rooms and

bottling plant. The tour ends with a
group tasting and the guide
demonstrates everything from how to
best open a bottle, how to sniff the
bouquet, how to swirl the wine and fi
nally how to taste.
After the tour you will be left to
browse through the winery shop
which sells everything from wine to
T-shirts. As at all wineries you are
never pressured to buy anything. Tas
ting is almost always free.
Continue north on 29 and, as you
pass through Oakville and Ruther
ford, you will see countless wineries
with open tasting rooms. Take a right
on 128 outside of Rutherford to visit
Nichelini Winery. This family-owned
vineyard is well off the beaten track
and is one of the most fun to visit if

filmed. There are tours of the
grounds and free wine tasting, al
though their wines are not noted for
their excellence.
Back on 29 again the next winery
north is Beringer. This winery has
one of the valley's more picturesque
vineyards and the mansion is a regis
tered historic landmark. They usually
require you to take the tour before al
lowing you to taste their wines.
Be sure not to miss a trip to Ster
ling Vineyards just south of Calistoga
at the northern end of the valley.
Make a right turn off 29 on Dunaweal
Road and follow the signs. The
winery is nestled atop a small hill and
sports a fabulous view of the entire
valley. Guests take a tram to the top
of the mountain to the winery (small

charge for the tram). Once atop the
mountain there is a self-guided tour
through the winery and tasting on an
outdoor deck with a stunning view.
North of Calistoga explore
Chateau Monteiena Vinyards. This
special spot offers what has to be the
most spectacular picnic site in the
entire valley. A man-made lake with
two small private picnic islands set
below the towering chateau offers
guests a magnificent setting for an af
ternoon repast. Reservations are a
must for the two islands, so call well
in advance. You can reach the vine
yard at 707-942-5105.
No matter where you stop you
can't go wrong. The Napa Valley is
world-renowned for producing some
of the best vintages anywhere.
