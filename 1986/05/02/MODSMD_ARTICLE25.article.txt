# Hottest spots in Napa
## 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN, CHRISTY MIDDLETON, JOHN SAGE BRENDA PASCOE 
While Napa is easily close enough to explore in a day
trip, its many wonders are best explored over several
days. The valley is filled with excellent inns and lodges
as well as superb restaurants.
If you are planning a balloon trip as part of your
Napa escape, it helps to stay close to your early morn
ing rendezvous site. As part of our report on four of
the major lodging options in the area, we will note
which balloon rendezvous sites are most convenient
from each inn.
The Silverado Country Club & Resort:
Less than 75 minutes north of San Francisco lies one
of the most sophisticated, romantic escapes in Califor
nia, The Silverado Country Club & Resort. Tucked in
the green Napa hills just beyond the vineyards, lies Sil
verado. This 1,200-acre resort offers everything guests
could want.
Two hundred and sixty-nine luxury condominium
style rooms surround two lush 18-hole championship
golf courses. Because the accommodations are spread
throughout the resort, you never feel crowded by your
fellow visitors.
There are no hotel rooms here. Instead, guests
choose from either spacious studios or one, two or
three-bedroom condominium suites. Our room, a stun
ning one-bedroom suite, had an unbeatable view of the
gold course and included living room with fireplace
and cable television, dining area, wet bar and fully
equipped kitchen.
The rooms are built in low-rise clusters. Each cluster
ofcondos shares a private courtyard with a small swim
ming pool and several tennis courts. For exercise en
thusiasts there are 20 tennis courts as well as a large
pool and spa complex near the main house.
Service is the watchword at Silverado. Housekeep
ing will go to all ends to please guests. They even sent
someone to town to buy a cheese grater for us when we
asked if they had a spare one for our kitchen.
In the main Country Club complex (bring a car as it's
over two miles from some of the rooms) there are ele
gant restaurants, a lively bar and the most helpful con
cierge imaginable. Be sure to ask the concierge for one
of Silverado's excellent free wine tasting maps.
Room rates vary with season and arrival dates so call
for details. For reservations or information call (707)
257-0200. For balloonists, the Silverado is most con
veniently located for passengers flying with Ad
ventures Aloft.
The Vintage Inn:
This relative newcomer is taking the Napa Valley by
surprise. Located in the heart of Yountville, this luxury
inn offers 80 spacious fireplace rooms. Each room is
decorated in the finest natural woods and the colors
are designed to match the various types of wines
produced in the valley.
Each room has either a private balcony or patio. All
accommodations feature automatic fresh coffee
makers, small refrigerator, fireplace, cable color TV,
ceiling fans and oversized beds (either two queens or
one king in most rooms).
The inn has a spacious pool (heated to over 85
degrees during our stay) and jacuzzi. Tennis and bike
rentals are also available. Complimentary breakfast is
served each morning at poolside, weather permitting.
The inn even owns its own private hot air balloon
which is operated by Adventures Aloft.
Room rates range from $89-$ 139, double oc
cupancy depending on season and day of the week. For
reservations or information call toll free (800) 851 -
1133 or (707) 944-1112. Easy access to balloon launch

sites for either Napa Valley Balloons or Adventures
Aloft.
Napa Valley Lodge:
This spacious 55-room facility is both comfortable
and convenient. Located just off Route 29 at
Yountville, the Napa Valley Lodge recently earned the
AAA Four Diamond Award for Exceptional Lodging
Standards.
The lodge is built in a Spanish style with
whitewashed stucco walls and red Spanish tiles. Rooms
are spacious and equipped with king or queen size beds
and private patios or balconies. Small touches like
fresh flowers, separate vanities and fresh-brew coffee
makers help make you forget you are in a relatively
large hotel.
Several select rooms have fireplaces set in the
middle of colorful tile. When making reservations try
to get a room facing north toward the scenic vineyard
(traffic from nearby Highway 29 will be muffled as
well).
The lodge offers a wide variety of amenities. Guests
can take advantage of an exercise and weight room,
sauna, swimming pool and whirlpool. Rental bikes are
available at the lodge for exploring the nearby biking
trails. Complimentary breakfast is offered each morn
ing at poolside.
Its location makes it especially convenient for bal
loonists flying with Napa Valley Balloons, Inc. Room
rates range from $92-$ 110, double occupancy per
night. Call (800) 528-1234 or (707) 944-2468 for
reservations.
Clarion Hotel:
The Napa Clarion, located just off 29 at the northern
end of Napa, is ideally suited for aeronauts flying with
Adventures Aloft. Adventures Aloft's co-company,
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley, holds its pre-dawn
rendezvous at the Clarion.
The hotel's greatest asset is its unique lobby, which is
done up to appear as though you are in a huge wine
cellar. It also has a large pool and jacuzzi area. The
rooms are standard, nothing extraordinary, but cer
tainly comfortable.
On weekdays, the Clarion caters mostly to a confer
ence crowd and it is easy for individual guests to feel a
bit lost in the shuffle. Weekends seem to attract more
individual reservations. The hotel has an in-house res
taurant with very good food but a disappointing selec
tion. The bar, however, was hopping with excellent live
music even during a weeknight.
Clarion room rates range from $86 (single) to $102
(double) including complimentary breakfast. For
reservations or information call (707) 253-7433 or call
Clarion's central reservations number at (800) 362-
6000.
Dining in Napa
One restaurant stands out so far above its competi
tors that it alone deserves mention here. La Boucane,
located at 1778 Second Street in downtown Napa, of
fers elegance, fine food and service, all at reasonable
prices.
Chef and owner Jacques Mokrani knows the restau
rant business. Before coming to Napa he had worked
at some of San Francisco's finest restaurants. His tradi
tion of offering the ultimate in service and cuisine dates
back to his days as senior chef aboard the elegant Mat
son Ocean Liners.
Jacques take ultimate pride in his small country-style
French restaurant in Napa When the hostess is busy he
comes out of the kitchen to help seat patrons. Between
bouts with the stove he is dashing from table to table
making certain that everything is just right. He always
has an extra minute to chat with patrons or to suggest
his favorite daily specialty or local wine.
For reservations call (707) 243-1177. Open daily
after 3 p.m.

night. Call (800) 528-1234 or (707) 944-2468 for
reservations.
Clarion Hotel:
The Napa Clarion, located just off 29 at the northern
end of Napa, is ideally suited for aeronauts flying with
Adventures Aloft. Adventures Aloft's co-company,
Balloon Aviation of Napa Valley, holds its pre-dawn
rendezvous at the Clarion.
The hotel's greatest asset is its unique lobby, which is
done up to appear as though you are in a huge wine
cellar. It also has a large pool and jacuzzi area. The
rooms are standard, nothing extraordinary, but cer
tainly comfortable.
On weekdays, the Clarion caters mostly to a confer
ence crowd and it is easy for individual guests to feel a
bit lost in the shuffle. Weekends seem to attract more
individual reservations. The hotel has an in-house res
taurant with very good food but a disappointing selec
tion. The bar, however, was hopping with excellent live
music even during a weeknight.
Clarion room rates range from $86 (single) to $102
(double) including complimentary breakfast. For
reservations or information call (707) 253-7433 or call
Clarion's central reservations number at (800) 362-
6000.
Dining in Napa
One restaurant stands out so far above its competi
tors that it alone deserves mention here. La Boucane,
located at 1778 Second Street in downtown Napa, of
fers elegance, fine food and service, all at reasonable
prices.
Chef and owner Jacques Mokrani knows the restau
rant business. Before coming to Napa he had worked
at some of San Francisco's finest restaurants. His tradi
tion of offering the ultimate in service and cuisine dates
back to his days as senior chef aboard the elegant Mat
son Ocean Liners.
Jacques take ultimate pride in his small country-style
French restaurant in Napa When the hostess is busy he
comes out of the kitchen to help seat patrons. Between
bouts with the stove he is dashing from table to table
making certain that everything is just right. He always
has an extra minute to chat with patrons or to suggest
his favorite daily specialty or local wine.
For reservations call (707) 243-1177. Open daily
after 3 p.m.
While Napa is easily close enough to explore in a day
trip, its many wonders are best explored over several
days. The valley is filled with excellent inns and lodges
as well as superb restaurants.
If you are planning a balloon trip as part of your
Napa escape, it helps to stay close to your early morn
ing rendezvous site. As part of our report on four of
the major lodging options in the area, we will note
which balloon rendezvous sites are most convenient
from each inn.
The Silverado Country Club & Resort:
Less than 75 minutes north of San Francisco lies one

could want.

gold course and included living room with fireplace
and cable television, dining area, wet bar and fully
equipped kitchen.
The rooms are built in low-rise clusters. Each cluster
ofcondos shares a private courtyard with a small swim
ming pool and several tennis courts. For exercise en
thusiasts there are 20 tennis courts as well as a large
pool and spa complex near the main house.
Service is the watchword at Silverado. Housekeep
ing will go to all ends to please guests. They even sent
someone to town to buy a cheese grater for us when we
asked if they had a spare one for our kitchen.
In the main Country Club complex (bring a car as it's
over two miles from some of the rooms) there are ele
gant restaurants, a lively bar and the most helpful con
cierge imaginable. Be sure to ask the concierge for one
of Silverado's excellent free wine tasting maps.

The lodge is built in a Spanish style with
whitewashed stucco walls and red Spanish tiles. Rooms

fresh flowers, separate vanities and fresh-brew coffee
makers help make you forget you are in a relatively
large hotel.

middle of colorful tile. When making reservations try
to get a room facing north toward the scenic vineyard
(traffic from nearby Highway 29 will be muffled as
well).

sauna, swimming pool and whirlpool. Rental bikes are
available at the lodge for exploring the nearby biking
trails. Complimentary breakfast is offered each morn
ing at poolside.
