## Babylon finds a home in the City 
### PETER MORGAN Senior staff writer 
The idea is simple, the execution
hilarious: take a whole bunch of those oldie
but-goodie '60s tunes, the corniest jokes
ever, and some headgear that Liberace
would balk at and you have "Beach Blanket
Babylon Goes Around the World."
This lightweight, broadly comic musical
revue has been playing since 1974, and the
energy and enjoyment of the cast in its most
recent version explains its success.
"BBB," as locals refer to it, is the perfect
night out for those who want to unwind after
a long week of deadlines, either business or
academic. Because the show is playing at the
intimate Club Fugazzi in San Francisco, one
is able to enjoy wine, beer and other festive
libations while watching the high-energy
singers and dancers as they use any excuse
to launch into a pop-tune from the past.
The show theoretically revolves around
one Dorothy Gale's search for a man to
love. Dorothy is a parody of Dorothy in
"The Wizard of Oz," and if her tremolo
voice doesn't tip you off that things are
going to get farcical pretty fast, the arrival of
the Good Witch of the West will (I'm not
going to ruin it and tell you why).
Anyway, Dorothy ends up traveling
through Rome, Paris, London, and points
east in her search for someone to love. This
is all an excuse for the wacky cast members
to play multiple roles in the various cities,
hamming it up and having a great time doing
it. Everyone from Cyndi Lauper to Louis

XIV shows up in Dorothy's quest, and the
line "anything for a gag" has never been
more appropriate.
In one show you get tap dancing sushi,
Mary Poppins, Dr. Ruth and Prince. If that's
not a deal I don't know what is. You also
have to sit through some of the worst puns
ever heard on stage.

I'll hold my tongue on the details, but the
French Can-Can has to be seen to be
believed. Finally there are the wigs. Again,
describing them would give it all away, but
suffice to say these creations alone would
make an evening's entertainment.
The only weak points in the show are
minor ones. Generally the cast over-sings in
an attempt to infect the audience with its
high energy and zaniness. This works, but
after an hour or so my ears wanted a slow,
quiet song. Also, the guys in the cast are

pretty boring in comparison to the temales,
mostly because of the production approach
rather than their relative abilities.
But these are easily forgotten in the clap
ping and cheering of the audience during the
show. Eveiyone is there for a good time, and
that's what one gets. It is a short, 90-minute
performance that is a great way to begin or

end a night in San Francisco (it has early and
late shows on Friday and Saturday in addi
tion to its normal times during the week).
"BBB" is perfect for a wild time in the
city with that special someone, for Senior
Pub Night or for anyone wanting to rock and
roll. For the "minors" (under 21) there are
also Sunday matinees (without the alcohol,
sorry. . .). The trick is getting tickets,
though, as the show is sold out weeks in ad
vance. Call on Monday when new blocks go
on sale. Be persistent. It's a good time.
