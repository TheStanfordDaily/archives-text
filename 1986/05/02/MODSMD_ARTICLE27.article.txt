Here we are in the mid-'Bos. Yep.
The age of technology. The age of the
Young Urban Professional. And
sooner or later, you knew it would
happen: the yuppie equivalent of a
Reese's commercial, the Compact
Disc Player. "You got your technol
ogy in my lifestyle!" "No, you got
your lifestyle in our technology!"
The result of all this is a brand new
market: people who will throw away
the music they bought last year to buy
the same music again at twice the
price. To honor this phenomenon
(while it lasts), KZSU Picks' Great
Leap Forward Program brings you,
ta-da, "The Compact Disc
Weekend."
If you're gonna waste your money
on these things, our only hope is at
least that we can narrow down the se
lections and keep you away from evil
things like Madonna, Mr. Mister and
Windham Hill.
The following are the CDs ap
proved by our Payola Bureau as
having the highest standards of sound
quality, plus good music too. And if
you're still reading by the end, our
extra-special Guide to Picking CDs
That We Didn't Review Here.

Phil Collins — "Hello, I Must Be
Going" Ahhhhh
Phil Collins — "Face Value" Ahhhhh
The first thing that people associate
with Phil Collins is his thuddin'
cannon-like drum style; these are
well-miked and you can turn 'em up
as loud as you want and it sounds just
great. Aside from adolescent air
drumming fantasies, though, the real
best thing about Collins' releases are
those cool, hot Phoenix Horns which
sound supertight when digitized. This
is good. Bad is when Phil blows 'em
off and instead turns to electronic
drumsounds (e.g., his most recent
"No Jacket Required"), which sound
terrible in any form, but particularly
pitiful on CD. Stick with the earlier
stuff and Phil's me-bang-drum-they
toot-horn philosophy.
Mannheim Steamroller — "Fresh
Aire V" Ahhhhh
Actually, the whole "Fresh Aire"
series is impeccably recorded, and the
music is as close as you'll ever get to

music both you and your parents can
like. But Mannheim does have a
penchant for pretense, and some of
the more turgid, oceanic orchestral
swells make ya want to puke, even if
there's no background noise.
Nevertheless, FAIII, FAIV and
FAChristmas all should do you up
good with their solid drums, well
recorded soft sections and occasional
grandiosity; and since a fair amount
of it is quality music, you're safe
there, too.
However, if you're just in it for the
synthesized sound effects, save it for a
Stanford Acoustic Research Labs
Test CD. The 747 and racquetball
match are fab, and are sure to bring
flocks of tourists when you show
them off.
Michael Jackson — "Thriller" Ahhhh
Dire Straits — "Brothers in Arms"
Ahhhhh
Sting — "The Dream of the Blue
Turtles" Ahhh
From the land of best-selling LPs
of all time come their counterparts in

CD-Land. The wows-per-dollar ratio
may not be up in Collins or Fagen
ville, but it's still pretty respectable,
especially compared to the aforemen
tioned Madonna. Moments in each
make you sigh with fleeting satisfac
tion that you blew a weeks' lunch
money (Food Service notwithstand
ing).
Highlights: Michael ventures into
the dreaded Haunted House; Mark
Knopfler's guitar chainsaws through
"Money for Nothing" 's wall of
sound; and the beginnings of each
song, before all the instruments mush
together and sound harsh, throughout
"Blue Turtles."
i Donald Fagen — "The Nightfly"
Ahhhhhhhh
Steely Dan — "Gaucho" Ahhhhhh
Steely Dan — "Aja" Ahhhhhh
The Steely Dan clan is better at 1)
songwriting, 2) microphone place
ment and 3) production than anyone
else, ever, anywhere. Lead singer
Donald Fagen's solo project is more

recent, and therefore more tech
nologically cool than the others; the
snare and bass drums are plenty crisp,
the hi-hat cymbals are undistorted
and Fagen actually manages to have
more than three instruments going at
once without muddling the sound.
The Steely Dan albums aren't digi
tal, but are almost up to "The
Nightfly" 's quality. And if that ain't
all you could want, the exciting yet
tasteful jazzrock is the best you'll get
until Steely Dan comes out with an
other effort, supposedly this year.
Guide to Picking CDs That We
Didn't Review Here
1) Wait as long as you can before
you buy a CD player. They're not
worth it. Records are just fine with a
good turntable and cartridge, cost a
lot less and the pictures are bigger on
the cover. And you can't rap 'n'
scratch with CDs — yet.
2) Don't just buy digitally mastered
CDs. They're not automatically bet
ter, no matter what anyone tells you.

Production quality is more important.
Sometimes digital helps, sometimes it
doesn't. It's a complex world out
there.
3) Most classical CDs sound better
than most rock CDs. Jazz CDs by es
tablished artists are probably nice
too, but we don't care about them.
4) The more rock instruments
playing at one time, the worse a CD's
sound gets. The best passages are solo
or near-solo acoustic instruments.
When everything comes in at once,
dynamic range goes out the window.
5) Don't buy live stuff.
6) Synthesizers reproduce just fine
without all the digital gimmickry.
They're manufactured waves without
any of the nuances of pianos, gee
tars, saxes, drums and people.
7) Heavy metal, as always, is
strictly forbidden. Don't even try to
explain why Iron Maiden sounds bet
ter digitized.
8) Throwing away records and
buying the same albums on CD is
downright silly.
9) Only one in 100 CDs is worth
the money. Check with us first:

Here we are in the mid-'Bos. Yep.
The age of technology. The age of the
Young Urban Professional. And
sooner or later, you knew it would
happen: the yuppie equivalent of a
Reese's commercial, the Compact
Disc Player. "You got your technol
ogy in my lifestyle!" "No, you got
your lifestyle in our technology!"
The result of all this is a brand new
market: people who will throw away
the music they bought last year to buy
the same music again at twice the
price. To honor this phenomenon
(while it lasts), KZSU Picks' Great
Leap Forward Program brings you,
ta-da, "The Compact Disc
Weekend."
If you're gonna waste your money
on these things, our only hope is at
least that we can narrow down the se
lections and keep you away from evil
things like Madonna, Mr. Mister and
Windham Hill.
The following are the CDs ap
proved by our Payola Bureau as
having the highest standards of sound
quality, plus good music too. And if
you're still reading by the end, our
extra-special Guide to Picking CDs
That We Didn't Review Here.

Phil Collins — "Hello, I Must Be
Going" Ahhhhh
Phil Collins — "Face Value" Ahhhhh
The first thing that people associate
with Phil Collins is his thuddin'
cannon-like drum style; these are
well-miked and you can turn 'em up
as loud as you want and it sounds just
great. Aside from adolescent air
drumming fantasies, though, the real
best thing about Collins' releases are
those cool, hot Phoenix Horns which
sound supertight when digitized. This
is good. Bad is when Phil blows 'em
off and instead turns to electronic
drumsounds (e.g., his most recent
"No Jacket Required"), which sound
terrible in any form, but particularly
pitiful on CD. Stick with the earlier
stuff and Phil's me-bang-drum-they
toot-horn philosophy.
Mannheim Steamroller — "Fresh
Aire V" Ahhhhh
Actually, the whole "Fresh Aire"
series is impeccably recorded, and the
music is as close as you'll ever get to

music both you and your parents can
like. But Mannheim does have a
penchant for pretense, and some of
the more turgid, oceanic orchestral
swells make ya want to puke, even if
there's no background noise.
Nevertheless, FAIII, FAIV and
FAChristmas all should do you up
good with their solid drums, well
recorded soft sections and occasional
grandiosity; and since a fair amount
of it is quality music, you're safe
there, too.
However, if you're just in it for the
synthesized sound effects, save it for a
Stanford Acoustic Research Labs
Test CD. The 747 and racquetball
match are fab, and are sure to bring
flocks of tourists when you show
them off.
Michael Jackson — "Thriller" Ahhhh
Dire Straits — "Brothers in Arms"
Ahhhhh
Sting — "The Dream of the Blue
Turtles" Ahhh
From the land of best-selling LPs
of all time come their counterparts in

CD-Land. The wows-per-dollar ratio
may not be up in Collins or Fagen
ville, but it's still pretty respectable,
especially compared to the aforemen
tioned Madonna. Moments in each
make you sigh with fleeting satisfac
tion that you blew a weeks' lunch
money (Food Service notwithstand
ing).
Highlights: Michael ventures into
the dreaded Haunted House; Mark
Knopfler's guitar chainsaws through
"Money for Nothing" 's wall of
sound; and the beginnings of each
song, before all the instruments mush
together and sound harsh, throughout
"Blue Turtles."
i Donald Fagen — "The Nightfly"
Ahhhhhhhh
Steely Dan — "Gaucho" Ahhhhhh
Steely Dan — "Aja" Ahhhhhh
The Steely Dan clan is better at 1)
songwriting, 2) microphone place
ment and 3) production than anyone
else, ever, anywhere. Lead singer
Donald Fagen's solo project is more

recent, and therefore more tech
nologically cool than the others; the
snare and bass drums are plenty crisp,
the hi-hat cymbals are undistorted
and Fagen actually manages to have
more than three instruments going at
once without muddling the sound.
The Steely Dan albums aren't digi
tal, but are almost up to "The
Nightfly" 's quality. And if that ain't
all you could want, the exciting yet
tasteful jazzrock is the best you'll get
until Steely Dan comes out with an
other effort, supposedly this year.
Guide to Picking CDs That We
Didn't Review Here
1) Wait as long as you can before
you buy a CD player. They're not
worth it. Records are just fine with a
good turntable and cartridge, cost a
lot less and the pictures are bigger on
the cover. And you can't rap 'n'
scratch with CDs — yet.
2) Don't just buy digitally mastered
CDs. They're not automatically bet
ter, no matter what anyone tells you.

Production quality is more important.
Sometimes digital helps, sometimes it
doesn't. It's a complex world out
there.
3) Most classical CDs sound better
than most rock CDs. Jazz CDs by es
tablished artists are probably nice
too, but we don't care about them.
4) The more rock instruments
playing at one time, the worse a CD's
sound gets. The best passages are solo
or near-solo acoustic instruments.
When everything comes in at once,
dynamic range goes out the window.
5) Don't buy live stuff.
6) Synthesizers reproduce just fine
without all the digital gimmickry.
They're manufactured waves without
any of the nuances of pianos, gee
tars, saxes, drums and people.
7) Heavy metal, as always, is
strictly forbidden. Don't even try to
explain why Iron Maiden sounds bet
ter digitized.
8) Throwing away records and
buying the same albums on CD is
downright silly.

the money. Check with us first:
