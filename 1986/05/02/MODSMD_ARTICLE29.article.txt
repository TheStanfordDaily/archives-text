# 'Trouble In Mind' overdoses on randomness
## Alan Rudolph's new excursion into film noir only leaves the viewers' minds troubled 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Alan Rudolph's "Trouble In
Mind," like his last "personal" film,
"Choose Me," seems to be taking
place entirely inside the head of Alan
Rudolph (hence the title). He dreams
up characters you would never meet
in real life, and probably would never
meet in your fantasy life, either.
They're all his own.
The characters and incidents form
unreal, random associations in
"Trouble in Mind," and if you aren't
on Rudolph's wavelength, you're lost,
because he isn't particularly inter
ested in drawing you into his world.
You either get it, or you don't
Still, I found "Trouble in Mind"
actually more accessible than
"Choose Me" (and it's certainly more
accessible than some of his other
films, like "Welcome to L.A."), per
haps because Rudolph draws on a lot
of very familiar '40s film noir tech
niques and grounds them in a reason
ably recognizable gangster plot.
"Choose Me" was a kind of fer
mented sex farce noir that was
grounded only in the characters'
crazed sex drives; it was a true
original, sporting some star perfor
mances by Leslie Annfc Warren,
Keith Carradine and Genevieve
Bujold (these last two also turn up in
"Trouble").
Though "Trouble in Mind" is more
openly parodic and derivative than
"Choose Me," at the same time it
seems more out-of-control. Rudolph
juggles a larger cast and multiple plot
threads in "Trouble," and directs
with less confidence than he has
shown in the past.
The movie is set in Rain City
(actually Seattle), where strange mili
tary cadres have taken over the
streets; prehaps the general atmos
phere of corruption and decay drew
them out. John Hawkins, known
simply as "Hawk" (Kris Kristoffer

son), a former cop imprisoned for kil
ling a man, has just gotten out of jail
and heads for Wanda's Cafe. Also
heading there are Coop (Carradine
again), his girlfriend Georgia (Lori
Singer) and their baby.
The characters arrive, mingle, go
off in little groups and form uneasy
associations. Hawk chases after
Wanda (Genevieve Bujold), then
after Georgia, while Coop becomes
involved in a little jewelry smuggling
with a cryptically philosophical
partner, Solo (Joe Morton).
As Coop slides inexorably into cor
ruption and decadence, he layers on
make-up and grows a huge Franken
stein pompadour with a massive
cowlick (its development serves as a
kind of index to his decline). Georgia,
initially hesitant, gradually falls for
Hawk, who moves easily among the
lives of the main characters and the
various underworld types who pop

ulate the city.
They're all organized under the
foppishly evil Hilly Blue (the female
impersonator Divine, playing it al
most straight), who enters rooms to
Pachelbel's Canon on a violin. The
interior of his home looks like a
cavernous Art Deco train station
(actually, it's the Seattle Art
Museum); it's there that the enter
taining, if completely pointless and
arbitrary final shoot-out takes place.
The tone of the movie is fatalistic,
but what happens doesn't seem inevi
table — merely random. Rudolph
draws Coop, Georgia, Hawk, Wanda
and Hilly together, but there isn't
much connecting these people except
for their archetypicality. We don't
find out anything about Wanda and
Hawk's relationship until near the
end; we assume there was once some
attraction, but when Hawk forces
himself on her, they might be perfect

strangers, and Kristofferson and
Bujold don't make any kind of emo
tional or romantic connection.
Coop and Solo steal jewelry from a
couple who later turn out" to be
friends of Hilly's, and it just seems
like a wild coincidence. Obviously
Rudolph is playing games with the
melodrama conventions of the old
gangster movies, but what's lacking is
any kind of narrative neatness. He
may feel he's too hip for neatness,
and that the portentous atmosphere is
an adequate substitute.
But in those old movies everything
in the plot could be explained by the
characters' greediness or corruption
or knowingness or innocence.
Rudolph doesn't give us a clue how to
read his characters; he seems to want
everyone in his movie to have equal
parts of every film noir character ever
put on film.
This doesn't lead to inevitability —

just confusion. Rudolph jerks his
puppets around on their strings, but
as the movie becomes more cluttered
with coincidence and incidental nar
rative, the strings get tangled, and we
don't know what the characters will
do next (this is undoubtably meant to
be hip, too). The movie has no kind
of unity and no center; it grinds along
from one layered movie reference to
the next.
The references become so layered
that the actors tend to get buried.
Bujold goes through the entire movie
looking like she did at the end of
"Choose Me." With her short
cropped, orange hairdo, she's a punk
pixie. Most of the time, she acts as if
she hadn't been let in the joke — I'm
sure she can play camp, but I'm also
sure that's not what Rudolph wants.
Wanda is the good-hearted woman
— badly used, but tough as nails —
and Rudolph doesn't want to send up

this convention, but he doesn't want
to play it completely straight either.
So poor Bujold is stuck with her
hopelessly out-of-place accent, frying
eggs in Wanda's Cafe and acting
motherly to the other characters.
Singer, who looks like a less
statuesque Daryl Hannah, has an
even worse role; she's the dewy-eyed
innocent without a thought in her
pretty little head. She and Car
radine's naive, hopelessly corruptible
Coop make a dreary pair. They're
boobs in toyland.
KristofTerson looks and acts like a
really nice guy, and Rudolph directed
him with laid-back skill in last year's
"Songwriter." But Kristofferson isn't
an actor, he's a personality, and his
personality is ludicrously wrong for
the character of Hawk, who's meant
to be part lone man of honor, part
nice guy and part asshole.
Kristofferson goes completely
blurry in this role; it's obvious he
doesn't know what's expected of him
(neither do we). His resources as an
actor come up most glaringly short in
a scene in which he has to manhandle
Wanda. He can't rise above this ugly
moment, and his character never
completely recovers our sympathies.
Hawk has a table-top toy model of
Rain City, and this movie is Rudolph's
toy; like "Diva" or "One from the
Heart," it's a director's toy, and I
doubt if he cares that the audience
isn't able to play along.
Certainly the various characters'
philosophies aren't designed for our
benefit; they're just part of the at
mosphere, and they make absolutely
no sense (they too are taken from an
amalgam of old movie characters).
Rudolph manages to squeeze a few
zingers into the dialogue, though, like
"Between the two of you, there's al
most a whole person." Lines like that,
with its double-edged reference to
Rudolph's shallow, archetypal crea
tions, are tiny breaths of fresh air in
the stale meanderings of the script.
