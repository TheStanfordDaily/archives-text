### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
In the wake of the accident at a Soviet nuclear reactor, a
Stanford senior left Kiev Wednesday accompanied by 70
British and six other American students.
Frank Brunotts, an international relations major, told
The Daily from London last night that the students voted

to leave Kiev for the Soviet capital of Moscow Wednesday
afternoon. The students left the USSR by plane yesterday
morning and arrived in Great Britain later in the day.
Although he said he was enjoying his stay in the USSR,
Brunotts said the danger presented by the nuclear acci
dent convinced him to leave. Brunotts arrived in the city
on April 15 to begin a quarter of study at the Kiev In
stitute of Foreign Languages.
After he learned Tuesday morning of the accident,

Brunotts said he remained inside, drank only bottled
water and avoided foods he thought might be con
taminated.
Many Western analysts believe the reactor, 60 miles
north of Kiev, exploded Saturday after experiencing a
cooling system failure last Friday.
Although one Soviet official told the students not to
worry about the accident, the Soviet government provided
the students with little information regarding the incident,
accOrdfhgf to BruhtfttS? The tsrtwp discovered the extent of
the accident from radio broadcasts of the British Broad
casting Company and Voice of America. The students
also talked with the American Embassy as well as family
and friends, he said.
Life in Kiev did not appear affected by the news of nu
clear accident, Brunotts said. "Everything was normal."
Although many Western authorities have called the
accident at the Chernobyl site the worst nuclear disaster in
history, Brunotts described the atti
tude of Kiev residents as
"nonchalant." Soviet citizens felt the
situation at the reactor was under
control, he said.
While Brunotts noticed no abnor
mal activity in the city, two French
university lecturers who recently
arrived in Moscow from Kiev told the
Los Angeles Times yesterday that
they had witnessed quarrels breaking
out in the city as some people tried to
stop others from talking about the
"Chernobyl tragedy."
The lecturers also said public
busing in a station near their lodgings
was requisitioned Saturday, and
there was heavy military traffic on the
outskirts of Kiev on Monday night.
The students, in Kiev with Progres
sive Tours of London, left the city by
train Wednesday night. Upon their
arrival in Moscow the next morning,
radiologists examined the students at
a clinic in the city. According to
Brunotts, Soviet officials said the
tests, which included scanning with a
geiger counter, revealed no signs of
radiation poisoning.
The students left the country on a
British Airways flight to London. At
the Moscow airport, a radiologist
screened the group for contamina
tion. After detecting higher than nor
mal radiation levels on the students,
British Airways gave the students
track suits to wear. All the con
taminated clothes were placed in
plastic bags, Brunotts said.
The group has also been examined

in London and Brunotts said he plans
to undergo futher testing. He added
that the results of the tests have not
yet been released.
Three votes were taken before the
students decided to leave Kiev, ac
cording to Brunotts. "There was a
whole spectrum of feelings" as to
whether the group should leave Kiev,
he said.
Hank Birnbaum, an American who
acted as the Kiev group's spokesman,
told the Los Angeles Times yesterday
that foreigners in the area had been
caught "between two worlds," not
knowing what to believe.
During a meeting of the students
Tuesday night, roughly half the group
favored canceling the remainder of
the trip. As the extent of the accident
became apparent, more students
began to favor leaving Kiev. By the
final vote Wednesday, all but seven of
the group wanted to leave, Brunotts
said.
According to Brunotts, the Soviet
authorities said the Progressive Tour
program would be canceled if at least
30 students did not remain. The
seven who wished to continue classes
were therefore forced to leave as
well, he said.
In a related development, safety
precautions are also being taken by
the University to protect students
studying in affected areas overseas.
According to Nancy Padgett, deputy
director of Overseas Studies, the Uni
versity has canceled scheduled field
trips from Stanford campuses in Ber
lin and Vienna to Poland. However,
there are no plaas to cancel the sum
mer session in Poland, she said.

history, Brunotts described the atti
tude of Kiev residents as
"nonchalant." Soviet citizens felt the
situation at the reactor was under
control, he said.
While Brunotts noticed no abnor
mal activity in the city, two French
university lecturers who recently
arrived in Moscow from Kiev told the
Los Angeles Times yesterday that
they had witnessed quarrels breaking
out in the city as some people tried to
stop others from talking about the
"Chernobyl tragedy."
The lecturers also said public
busing in a station near their lodgings
was requisitioned Saturday, and
there was heavy military traffic on the
outskirts of Kiev on Monday night.
The students, in Kiev with Progres
sive Tours of London, left the city by
train Wednesday night. Upon their
arrival in Moscow the next morning,
radiologists examined the students at
a clinic in the city. According to
Brunotts, Soviet officials said the
tests, which included scanning with a
geiger counter, revealed no signs of
radiation poisoning.
The students left the country on a
British Airways flight to London. At
the Moscow airport, a radiologist
screened the group for contamina
tion. After detecting higher than nor
mal radiation levels on the students,
British Airways gave the students
track suits to wear. All the con
taminated clothes were placed in
plastic bags, Brunotts said.
The group has also been examined

in London and Brunotts said he plans
to undergo futher testing. He added
that the results of the tests have not
yet been released.
Three votes were taken before the
students decided to leave Kiev, ac
cording to Brunotts. "There was a
whole spectrum of feelings" as to
whether the group should leave Kiev,
he said.
Hank Birnbaum, an American who
acted as the Kiev group's spokesman,
told the Los Angeles Times yesterday
that foreigners in the area had been
caught "between two worlds," not
knowing what to believe.
During a meeting of the students
Tuesday night, roughly half the group
favored canceling the remainder of
the trip. As the extent of the accident
became apparent, more students
began to favor leaving Kiev. By the
final vote Wednesday, all but seven of
the group wanted to leave, Brunotts
said.
According to Brunotts, the Soviet
authorities said the Progressive Tour
program would be canceled if at least
30 students did not remain. The
seven who wished to continue classes
were therefore forced to leave as
well, he said.
In a related development, safety
precautions are also being taken by
the University to protect students
studying in affected areas overseas.
According to Nancy Padgett, deputy
director of Overseas Studies, the Uni
versity has canceled scheduled field
trips from Stanford campuses in Ber
lin and Vienna to Poland. However,
there are no plaas to cancel the sum
mer session in Poland, she said.
