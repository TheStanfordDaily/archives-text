The Godfather, Parts I & II (1972 &
1974)
Pagoda Theater, San Francisco
Together, these two movies, di
rected by Francis Ford Coppola, are
perhaps the most magnificent epic
ever made in (or about) this country.
Coppola, working from a script that
he and Mario Puzo adapted from
Puzo's bestseller, deals in Part I with
inheritance and corruption: young,
idealistic Michael Corleone takes
over his father's underworld regime
in the 1940s when the old man is
nearly murdered by henchmen at
tached to a rival family. In Part 11,
which takes us back to the seeds of
this violence in early 20th-century
Sicily and forward to the metamor
phosis of Michael and the break
down of his family in the '50s,
expands on these same themes.
Much praise has justifiably been
given to Gordon Willis' photogra
phy, the music by Nino Rota and
Carmine Coppola, and the really as
tonishing panoply of performances,
especially those of A 1 Pacino, Mar
lon Brando, Robert De Niro, James
Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale,
Lee Strasberg, Michael Gazzo and
Talia Shire.
Plays Monday.

Time Bandits (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director Terry Gilliam's notion of
a children's fantasy includes lots of
visceral nastiness, rude satire and a
manic tone. He may not be far off; a
lot of those elements go into classic
fairy tales, and they abound in this
entertaining, wildly inconsistent
movie. A team of thieving dwarves
kidnap a little boy and whisk him
through time, where they meet up
with very unromantic legendary fig
ures and openly hostile fantasy fig
ures. Like Gilliam's "Brazil," "Time
Bandits" is bursting with interesting
ideas, but unlike the later movie
they aren't contained within any
kind of coherent structure. It's a
very enjoyable mess, though. Some
of the actors who turn up include
Sean Connery, Shelley Duvall, John
Cleese, David Warner, Michael
Palin and Katherine Helmond.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
"Back to the Future."
The 400 Blows (1959)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's film, which
ends with the most famous freeze
frame in movie history, is a

melancholy study of unhappy
adolescence. It touched the imagina
tion of audiences not only in France
but here as well, and even today
directors who attempt studies of
teenage rites of passage risk com
parisons with "The 400 Blows." The
hero, Antoine Doinel, is played by
15-year-old Jean-Pierre Leaud;
Truffaut returned to Doinel in sub
sequent pictures ("Love at Twenty,"
"Stolen Kisses," "Bed and Board,"
"Love on the Run"), but they were
romantic comedies that seem trivial
when you watch the original, and
Leaud has never again equalled his
acting here.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Small Change."
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
(1978)
Pagoda Theater, San Francisco
This remake of the classic 1956
scare picture is a classic in its own
right; it's a hugely entertaining sci-fi
horror movie that takes off from the
paranoid premise of the original,
updates the social subtext and plops
the mixture down in San Francisco.
The story is, of course, about alien
vegetable pods replacing real people

while they sleep; the trick becomes
telling who's real and who's a veggie
replica. The threat in the first movie
was generally considered a meta
phor for the creeping subversion of
communism; in this new version, the
pod people all talk and act as if
they'd just gone through est, and the
heroes are scrambling to hang on to
their personal identities. The prem
ise is great — at once terrifying and
funny — and director Phil Kaufman
and writer W.D. Richter execute it
faultlessly; no filmmaking team has
ever used San Francisco in quite so
original a way. The performers,
many of whom have never been bet
ter, include Donald Sutherland,
Brooke Adams, Jeff Goldblum,
Leonard Nimoy and (best of all)
Veronica Cartwright. Don Seigel
and Kevin McCarthy, director and
star of the first "Body Snatchers,"
turn up in cameos.
Plays Thursday with "Dirty
Harry."
Mv Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from
England spins together an entire
socio-political milieu; it's about

Pakistanis in modern South London,
who work in a variety of tawdry
businesses — some legitimate, some
not. The world we see is divided into
the enterprising, entrepreneurial
Pakistanis and the white, racist
street punks, aimless casualties of
Thatcher's economic policies. All of
the characters spend much time dis
cussing their politics, but they re
never just pushing around a series of
position papers — they grab onto
their beliefs and turn them into
designs for living. Director Stephen
Frears and writer Hanif Kureishi do
their characters full justice; they
create the sense of a whole commu
nity living and thriving off the South
London decay, and each aspect they
reveal is a surprising discovery.
Larger issues grow out of the charac
ters' sexual, financial and political
motivations, but Frears and Kureishi
keep the mixture light and frothy,
and they don't pass harsh judg
ments. It's a wonderfully exuberant
movie, with a terrific group of
performers: Gordon Warnecke,
Daniel Day Lewis, Saeed Jaffrey.
Roshan Seth, Rita Wolf, Shirley
Anne Field and Derrick Branche.
Plays this week with "Trouble in
Mind."
