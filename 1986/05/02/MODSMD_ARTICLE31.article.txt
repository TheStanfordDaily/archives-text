## Cardinal to tangle with speedy 'Cats 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Someone's title hopes figure to die this
weekend at Sunken Diamond.
Either Stanford, the two-time defending
champion of the Pacific 10 Conference's South
ern Division, or Arizona will wake up Monday
morning with little or no chance to finish atop
the Six-Pac's standings.
Coming into this weekend's three-game set,
the schools, which share identical 14-10 league
marks, are tied for second place in the Six-Pac,

one game behind UCLA, 15-
9.
This afternoon's first game
is scheduled to start at 2:30.
The series continues with 1
p.m. games tomorrow and
Sunday.
Meanwhile, UCLA hosts
Arizona State, at 11-13 the
Six-Pac's fourth-place team,
for three games in Los An
geles. California and USC are
idle.

After this weekend's action, each contender
will have only three Six-Pac games left on its
30-game league schedule.
That means it's now or never.
"We're not going to save anything," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "If we have a
chance to win a game, we'll do what we have to.
There's no use saving anyone at this stage in the
season."
Right now, UCLA has to be the favorite. The
Bruins play five of their next six games at home.

UCLA will likely prosper as Stanford and
Arizona beat up on each other this weekend.
"UCLA's got the easiest go of it," Marquess
said, "but in this league you never know. This is
the most balanced the league has been since its
inception. That's what makes it so hard on the
coaches and the fans . . . just when you think
you've got it figured out, something happens to
turn it all on its ear."
Take last weekend. Stanford, atop the Six-
Pac by a game, ventured to Los Angeles to play

lowly USC. Time to fatten up,
to pad a lead, right?
USC had other ideas. The
Trojans took all three games
— the first time in more than
two years-that a Stanford team
had been swept in a three
game league series — and
jarred the Cardinal from the
top spot of the Six-Pac.
Now Stanford returns home
for a crucial series to face a

team that has won 17 of its last 21 games.
"Sure, we're disappointed (about the USC
debacle)" Marquess said. "But we're not down,
we'll be ready to play."
Today's opener pits Stanford's Jack
McDowell, a tough-luck loser in Los Angeles
last Friday night, against Arizona's Gilbert
Heredia.

shoulder in recent weeks, "feels healthy for the

first time in three weeks," according to Marquess. The
right-hander, 9-3 on the year, comes into the game
leading the Six-Pac in strikeouts (108 in 109 2/3 innings),
complete games (8), shutouts (2) and ERA (2.54).
McDowell beat Arizona 6-4 in Tucson back on Feb. 28
in the league opener for both teams.
Heredia, a sinkerballer, lasted 8 1/3 innings to earn a
win against the Cardinal on March 1. The right-hander
sports a 10-3 record to go with a 4.97 ERA.
On Saturday, Marquess will send Kevin Kunkel, 4-4
with a 3.73 ERA, to the mound against Arizona's John
Carley. Carley, 4-2 on the year, suffered a loss in an ear
lier meeting between the teams after surrendering four
runs in less than two innings.
Lee Plemel, whose record fell to 4-3 after Sunday's loss
at USC, will get the call in the series wrapup. Arizona has
not named a starter.
Arizona, a team with a collective .332 batting average,
brings some big guns to Sunken Diamond.
Catcher Steve Strong, who missed the earlier Stanford-
Arizona series, leads the Six-Pac in hitting with a .448
batting average.
First baseman Todd Trafton (.377 and 10 home runs)
and left fielder Mike Senne (.330 and eight home runs)
provide more punch.
Marquess said: " Arizona is a lot like UCLA in that they
have good team power. But unlike UCLA, they have
great team speed, in that way they present a little more of
a problem."

Now Stanford returns home
for a crucial series to face a

team that has won 17 of its last 21 games.
"Sure, we're disappointed (about the USC
debacle)" Marquess said. "But we're not down,
we'll be ready to play."
Today's opener pits Stanford's Jack
McDowell, a tough-luck loser in Los Angeles
last Friday night, against Arizona's Gilbert
Heredia.

first time in three weeks," according to Marquess. The
right-hander, 9-3 on the year, comes into the game
leading the Six-Pac in strikeouts (108 in 109 2/3 innings),
complete games (8), shutouts (2) and ERA (2.54).
McDowell beat Arizona 6-4 in Tucson back on Feb. 28
in the league opener for both teams.
Heredia, a sinkerballer, lasted 8 1/3 innings to earn a
win against the Cardinal on March 1. The right-hander
sports a 10-3 record to go with a 4.97 ERA.
On Saturday, Marquess will send Kevin Kunkel, 4-4
with a 3.73 ERA, to the mound against Arizona's John
Carley. Carley, 4-2 on the year, suffered a loss in an ear
lier meeting between the teams after surrendering four
runs in less than two innings.
Lee Plemel, whose record fell to 4-3 after Sunday's loss
at USC, will get the call in the series wrapup. Arizona has
not named a starter.
Arizona, a team with a collective .332 batting average,
brings some big guns to Sunken Diamond.
Catcher Steve Strong, who missed the earlier Stanford-
Arizona series, leads the Six-Pac in hitting with a .448
batting average.
First baseman Todd Trafton (.377 and 10 home runs)
and left fielder Mike Senne (.330 and eight home runs)
provide more punch.
Marquess said: " Arizona is a lot like UCLA in that they
have good team power. But unlike UCLA, they have
great team speed, in that way they present a little more of
a problem."

Someone's title hopes figure to die this
weekend at Sunken Diamond.
Either Stanford, the two-time defending
champion of the Pacific 10 Conference's South
ern Division, or Arizona will wake up Monday
morning with little or no chance to finish atop
the Six-Pac's standings.
Coming into this weekend's three-game set,
the schools, which share identical 14-10 league
marks, are tied for second place in the Six-Pac,

one game behind UCLA, 15-
9.
This afternoon's first game
is scheduled to start at 2:30.
The series continues with 1
p.m. games tomorrow and
Sunday.
Meanwhile, UCLA hosts
Arizona State, at 11-13 the
Six-Pac's fourth-place team,
for three games in Los An
geles. California and USC are
idle.

After this weekend's action, each contender
will have only three Six-Pac games left on its
30-game league schedule.
That means it's now or never.
"We're not going to save anything," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "If we have a
chance to win a game, we'll do what we have to.
There's no use saving anyone at this stage in the
season."
Right now, UCLA has to be the favorite. The
Bruins play five of their next six games at home.

UCLA will likely prosper as Stanford and
Arizona beat up on each other this weekend.
"UCLA's got the easiest go of it," Marquess
said, "but in this league you never know. This is
the most balanced the league has been since its
inception. That's what makes it so hard on the
coaches and the fans . . . just when you think
you've got it figured out, something happens to
turn it all on its ear."
Take last weekend. Stanford, atop the Six-
Pac by a game, ventured to Los Angeles to play

lowly USC. Time to fatten up,
to pad a lead, right?
USC had other ideas. The
Trojans took all three games
— the first time in more than
two years-that a Stanford team
had been swept in a three
game league series — and
jarred the Cardinal from the
top spot of the Six-Pac.
Now Stanford returns home
for a crucial series to face a
