# Stanford battles California for NCAA berth
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Remember back in the '70s when the
Army-Navy football games would come on
television with all sorts of hoopla, and you
wondered why? Usually both teams were 3-8,
and the only bowl they were going to see was
full of beef stew back at the academies'
cafeterias.
Well, that's the way Stanford versus Cali
fornia men's tennis matches have been for
quite a while â€” the usual big game hoopla,
but no real importance. The match usually

made no difference because the Cardinal
squad was so much better than the Golden
Bears.
This year, however, things are different.
Today's 1:30 p.m. match at Berkeley be
tween the two teams could determine whether
the Cardinal or the Bears go to the NCAA
tournament to be held in Athens, Ga. later
this month.
Stanford is currently ranked sixth in the na
tion, while California is in a tie for eighth. The
NCAA has 16 berths but also tries to pick a
field comprised of teams from across the
country.

And this is why today's match is so crucial.
Three California schools, UCLA, USC and
Pepperdine, are ranked above both Stanford
and Cal. In addition. Long Beach State, which
is currently ranked 17th, defeated Stanford
rather handily earlier in the year.
UCLA will get the automatic bid, but in all
likelihood the rest of those teams aren't going
to make it.
"The West Coast isn't going to get five at
large bids," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said
Wednesday. "In fact there might be only
three."
If that's the case, then the outcome of

today's match looms large. If Stanford wins
then the Cardinal is probably in. If California
wins, then things will remain cloudy.
"We can solve this thing pretty easily by
beating Cal," Gould said. "But there's still an
outside shot that we won't go (to the
NCAAs)."
California Coach Bill Wright doesn't think
there's any doubt.
"IfStanford beats us, then they'll definitely
get a bid," he said yesterday. "But we are still
harboring the hope that we'll get one too.
We've got a big harbor."
The Bears may also have a big hole to fill in

their lineup. California's top player, seventh
ranked Steve DeVries, missed Wednesday's
match against Pepperdine (which Pepperdine
won 7-2) due to contusions on his right
(racket) hand.
"(The hand) is much much better than it
was," Wright said. "But 1 don't know if he'll
be ready to play and I don't know if it's even
worth the risk." DeVries was also hurt last
month when Stanford whipped the Bears by
an 8-1 score. His presence or lack thereof
may be the key tomorrow.
