# Big Row set for Saturday
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
First there was Big Game. . . . Now
there is Big Row.
The Big Row, this weekend's
equally attractive non-football altern
ative, will pit the Stanford men's and
women's crew teams against their
archrivals from across the Bay. The
Cardinal will travel into Bear terri
tory to face California on the Oak
land Estuary at 2 p.m. Saturday in
their last dual meet before the Pacific
Coast Championships to be held next
weekend.
The proximity in the schedule of
this annual rivalry presents problems
for the crews as far as training is con
cerned. Both teams are beginning to
taper for next weekend while at the
same time trying to stay ready for this
weekend.
"It's difficult not to get so up for
Cal," Stanford women's Coach John
Davis said. "So much so we almost
forget about Pac 10s next weekend.
We'd sure like to win this one, but, by
the same token, next weekend is what
goes in the record books."
Despite their competitive dilemma,
the Cardinal crews are looking for
ward to facing California once again.
"We're psyched and we're ready,"
Stanford men's Coach Ken Dreyfuss
said. "Cal is the perfect opponent at
the perfect time."
The men will be fighting for the Big
Jim Reynold's Cup. The Cup is the
crew equivalent of The Axe and
equally sought after and cherished.
Stanford may have its hands full,
however. The Cal men's varsity is the
undisputed No. 1 team on the West
Coast and No. 2 in the nation.
In approaching this weekend, the
Cardinal crew has retained the same
lineup but switched seats and the
kind of strokes it will use in the race.
This will hopefully add speed to the
already quick team. "All the men's
boats seem to be flying." Davis said.
"They're not just going to get pow
dered like in the past. In my estima
tion, this is the most improved Stan
ford team I've seen in my seven years
here."
The JV and freshman boats are
nothing for Cal to dismiss either —

Cardinal boats.

knowledge necessary to row a high
quality, emotion-filled race,"
Dreyfuss said.
The women have also revamped
their varsity-boat seating in hopes of
picking up valuable seconds. The
Cardinal is favored in this meeting,
but still isn't taking Cal lightly. "Cal is

just too volatile to make predictions,"
Davis said. "It'll be a tough, tough
race. Cal in dual racing is particularly
harrowing"
The choppy conditions expected on
the race course could prove to be
the difference. The Stanford women
have practiced in the Bay in anticipa
tion of a rough race, while Cal has
been practicing in the flatter condi
tions of courses nestled in the foot
hills. '
