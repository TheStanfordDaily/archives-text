# Golfers stumble down in Arizona
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The Sun Devil Intercollegiate
hosted by Arizona State boasts what
one might call a dream field. But for
the Stanford men's golf team, the first
round was a nightmare.
The Cardinal, one of many national
championship contenders among the
15 team field, struggled to a 15-over
par 375 as a team yesterday, leaving
it in 12th place, 26 strokes behind
leader ASU.
The Sun Devils shot 11-under par
on the par 72, McCormick Ranch golf
course in Scottsdale to lead Brigham
Young by seven strokes. Tied for
third are USC and Florida, three
strokes behind the Cougars at 359.
It's no surprise that Stanford is be
hind Pac-10 rivals ASU or USC, who
have been hot all year, nor is it too as
tonishing to find that they trail other
top schools, such as BYU or Fresno
State (which is tied for seventh).
However, the Cardinal is sixth out
of the six Pac-10 teams in the tourna
ment, which unusual as it has spent all
spring establishing itself as the third
best team in the conference.
USC Coach Randy Lein didn't
seem to think that Stanford's current
position would necessarily be a per
manent one, however.

"They didn't have a good day but
they could turn it around tomorrow,"
Lein said.
Unlike its last tournament, the
snow- and hail-plagued Cougar Clas
sic in Provo, Utah, the Cardinal can
not attribute its high scoring to the
weather.
"Today was a perfect day to
score," Lein said. "It was hot, but it
was still. . . . The course is very fast."
ASU's Rich Bietz and Bill Mayfair
took the greatest advantage of the
conditions on their home course, as
they each shot five-under-par 67's to
lead the individuals yesterday. USC's
Sam Randolph fired six birdies on his
first seven holes on his way to a 68,
leaving him in third. Four are tied at
69.
On the other hand, no Stanford
golfer broke par yesterday. Carl
Wagner led the team with a one
over-par 73, with Don Walsworth a
swing behind at 74. John Dickey
stroked a 75, Phil Rowley a 76 and
Roger Miraglia a 77. Rich Marik
broke the sequence with a 79.
While none of those scores were
particularly bad, Stanford needs at
least a couple of superior scores in or
der to try to erase some of its first
round deficit. Only 11 strokes out of
sixth place, the Cardinal has today
and tomorrow to try to turn things
around.
