# Netters experience deja vu vs. UCLA
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
After what occurred last weekend
at the Ojai Intercollegiate, it's really
kind of surprising that the UCLA
women's tennis team is still inviting
Stanford to play in Westwood this af
ternoon.
The Cardinal beat up on the Bruins
on five different occasions at Ojai.
When you couple this with the fact
that Stanford beat UCLA 8-1 on Feb.
28, the picture begins to look bleak
for the Blue and Gold.
Despite its 16-1 record and recent
successes in Ojai, all the news has not
been upbeat for the Cardinal. In the
ITCA rankings just released, Stan
ford remained No. 2 behind USC,
though the Cardinal knocked off the
Trojans 5-4 on April 19.

More problematic, however, are
the painful shin splints in Eleni
Rossides' legs. The Stanford fresh
man, who currently is ranked No. 20
nationally, has been using a golf cart
to get around campus so that she can
rest her legs. Still, she is extremely
doubtful for the NCAA champion
ship, which takes place May 15-23 in
Austin, Texas.
If you were to ask UCLA, the
Cardinal hardly seems to be dis
traught by its No. 2 ranking. Nor does
it seem to be suffering without
Rossides.
Junior Patty Fendick and freshman
Marianne Werdel, playing at No. 1
and No. 2 singles, respectively, are
playing their best, most consistent
tennis of the season.
Fendick feasted on a UCLA diet
during the semi-finals and finals of
the Women's Intercollegiate Singles
at Ojai. Last Saturday, she easily beat
the Bruins' Jennifer Fuchs 6-3, 6-2 in
the semis. The next morning, Fendick
captured the title with a 6-2, 6-4 vic
tory over UCLA's Patricia Hy.
Though she probably won't be
playing against Fuchs or Hy today,
Fendick's opponent in the No. 1
singles match will be another Bruin
whom she has defeated this season —
Jane Thomas. In the Feb. 28 match,
Fendick rolled over Thomas 6-3, 6-4.

Thomas, currently 20-15 overall
this season, had trouble with another
Cardinal player last weekend. In the
finals of the Women's Invitational
College Singles at Ojai, Werdel over
whelmed her 6-2, 6-2. Earlier in the
draw, Werdel had defeated UCLA's
Joni Urban.
Werdel, 8-5 in dual matches, did
not play against the Bruins in the
teams' earlier match. Today, she will
likely be up against Urban again. The
UCLA sophomore is 19-14 overall.
The No. 3 singles should pit Fuchs
against Stanford's highest-ranked
player — Leigh Anne Eldredge. The
Cardinal junior is 12-2 in dual
matches and is ranked No. 13 nation

ally in singles. She advanced to the
quarterfinal at Ojai before losing to
San Diego State's Catherine Berry in
three sets.
Junior Stephanie Savides, 13-3 in
dual matches, will play in the No. 4
singles match against UCLA's Al
lyson Cooper. The two met last
weekend in doubles but have not
played each other in singles this
season. Cooper was the only-vic
torious Bruin in the previous match
with the Cardinal.
The No. 5 singles will feature soph
omore Kay Tittle and the Bruins'
Maria La Franchi. Tittle has not been
in action since the April 19 match
against USC because of illnesses and
injuries. She leads the Cardinal with a
13-2 singles record this season.
Rounding out the singles competi
tion will be Stanford sophomore Cari
Hagey and Hy. Hagey is 8-1 since
stepping into the singles lineup for
the injured Rossides.
Should the match come down to
the doubles play, the Cardinal would
seem to have the advantage.
Stanford's No. 1 team of Fendick
and Eldredge is No. 6 in the latest
rankings, having compiled a 10-4
record this season. In contrast,
UCLA's No. 1 team of Fuchs and Ur
ban is 1-4 in limited action.
Following an impressive tourna
ment in Ojai, Hagey and Savides
have moved up to No. 10 in the
doubles rankings. The pair is 11-1 in
the No. 2 spot this year. The Bruins'
No. 2 team of Thomas and Hy is 5-1.
The Cardinal and Bruins both sport
strong No. 3 doubles teams. Tittle
and Werdel are 10-2 for Stanford and
La Franchi and Colinne Bartel are 6-
0 for UCLA.
Following today's match, the Card
inal will come home to compete in
Sunday's 6:30 p.m. mixed indoor
event in Maples Pavilion against Cali
fornia. Originally, the team was
scheduled to play at Pepperdine to
morrow, but that match was canceled
by the Waves because they no longer
are in school.

Stephanie Savides recently leaped into the 10th spot in the national doubles rankings with

at Ojai. Last Saturday, she easily beat
the Bruins' Jennifer Fuchs 6-3, 6-2 in
the semis. The next morning, Fendick
captured the title with a 6-2, 6-4 vic
tory over UCLA's Patricia Hy.
Though she probably won't be
playing against Fuchs or Hy today,
Fendick's opponent in the No. 1
singles match will be another Bruin
whom she has defeated this season —
Jane Thomas. In the Feb. 28 match,
Fendick rolled over Thomas 6-3, 6-4.

Thomas, currently 20-15 overall
this season, had trouble with another
Cardinal player last weekend. In the
finals of the Women's Invitational
College Singles at Ojai, Werdel over
whelmed her 6-2, 6-2. Earlier in the
draw, Werdel had defeated UCLA's
Joni Urban.
Werdel, 8-5 in dual matches, did
not play against the Bruins in the
teams' earlier match. Today, she will
likely be up against Urban again. The
UCLA sophomore is 19-14 overall.
The No. 3 singles should pit Fuchs
against Stanford's highest-ranked
player — Leigh Anne Eldredge. The
Cardinal junior is 12-2 in dual
matches and is ranked No. 13 nation

ally in singles. She advanced to the
quarterfinal at Ojai before losing to
San Diego State's Catherine Berry in
three sets.
Junior Stephanie Savides, 13-3 in
dual matches, will play in the No. 4
singles match against UCLA's Al
lyson Cooper. The two met last
weekend in doubles but have not
played each other in singles this
season. Cooper was the only-vic
torious Bruin in the previous match
with the Cardinal.
The No. 5 singles will feature soph
omore Kay Tittle and the Bruins'
Maria La Franchi. Tittle has not been
in action since the April 19 match
against USC because of illnesses and
injuries. She leads the Cardinal with a
13-2 singles record this season.
Rounding out the singles competi
tion will be Stanford sophomore Cari
Hagey and Hy. Hagey is 8-1 since
stepping into the singles lineup for
the injured Rossides.
Should the match come down to
the doubles play, the Cardinal would
seem to have the advantage.
Stanford's No. 1 team of Fendick
and Eldredge is No. 6 in the latest
rankings, having compiled a 10-4
record this season. In contrast,
UCLA's No. 1 team of Fuchs and Ur
ban is 1-4 in limited action.
Following an impressive tourna
ment in Ojai, Hagey and Savides
have moved up to No. 10 in the
doubles rankings. The pair is 11-1 in
the No. 2 spot this year. The Bruins'
No. 2 team of Thomas and Hy is 5-1.
The Cardinal and Bruins both sport
strong No. 3 doubles teams. Tittle
and Werdel are 10-2 for Stanford and
La Franchi and Colinne Bartel are 6-
0 for UCLA.
Following today's match, the Card
inal will come home to compete in
Sunday's 6:30 p.m. mixed indoor
event in Maples Pavilion against Cali
fornia. Originally, the team was
scheduled to play at Pepperdine to
morrow, but that match was canceled
by the Waves because they no longer
are in school.

Stephanie Savides recently leaped into the 10th spot in the national doubles rankings with
partner Cari Hagey. The pair has compiled a sterling 11-1 record, and Savides has been
nearly as effective in the No. 4 singles spot with a 13-3 audit.
After what occurred last weekend
at the Ojai Intercollegiate, it's really
kind of surprising that the UCLA
women's tennis team is still inviting
Stanford to play in Westwood this af
ternoon.
The Cardinal beat up on the Bruins
on five different occasions at Ojai.
When you couple this with the fact
that Stanford beat UCLA 8-1 on Feb.
28, the picture begins to look bleak
for the Blue and Gold.
Despite its 16-1 record and recent
successes in Ojai, all the news has not
been upbeat for the Cardinal. In the
ITCA rankings just released, Stan
ford remained No. 2 behind USC,
though the Cardinal knocked off the
Trojans 5-4 on April 19.

More problematic, however, are
the painful shin splints in Eleni
Rossides' legs. The Stanford fresh
man, who currently is ranked No. 20
nationally, has been using a golf cart
to get around campus so that she can
rest her legs. Still, she is extremely
doubtful for the NCAA champion
ship, which takes place May 15-23 in
Austin, Texas.
If you were to ask UCLA, the
Cardinal hardly seems to be dis
traught by its No. 2 ranking. Nor does
it seem to be suffering without
Rossides.
Junior Patty Fendick and freshman
Marianne Werdel, playing at No. 1
and No. 2 singles, respectively, are
playing their best, most consistent
tennis of the season.
Fendick feasted on a UCLA diet
during the semi-finals and finals of
the Women's Intercollegiate Singles
at Ojai. Last Saturday, she easily beat
the Bruins' Jennifer Fuchs 6-3, 6-2 in
the semis. The next morning, Fendick
captured the title with a 6-2, 6-4 vic
tory over UCLA's Patricia Hy.
