# Netters experience deja vu vs. UCLA
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
After what occurred last weekend
at the Ojai Intercollegiate, it's really
kind of surprising that the UCLA
women's tennis team is still inviting
Stanford to play in Westwood this af
ternoon.
The Cardinal beat up on the Bruins
on five different occasions at Ojai.
When you couple this with the fact
that Stanford beat UCLA 8-1 on Feb.
28, the picture begins to look bleak
for the Blue and Gold.
Despite its 16-1 record and recent
successes in Ojai, all the news has not
been upbeat for the Cardinal. In the
ITCA rankings just released, Stan
ford remained No. 2 behind USC,
though the Cardinal knocked off the
Trojans 5-4 on April 19.

More problematic, however, are
the painful shin splints in Eleni
Rossides' legs. The Stanford fresh
man, who currently is ranked No. 20
nationally, has been using a golf cart
to get around campus so that she can
rest her legs. Still, she is extremely
doubtful for the NCAA champion
ship, which takes place May 15-23 in
Austin, Texas.
If you were to ask UCLA, the
Cardinal hardly seems to be dis
traught by its No. 2 ranking. Nor does
it seem to be suffering without
Rossides.
Junior Patty Fendick and freshman
Marianne Werdel, playing at No. 1
and No. 2 singles, respectively, are
playing their best, most consistent
tennis of the season.
