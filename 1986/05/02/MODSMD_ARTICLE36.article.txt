# Cal strong favorite in men's Big Meet
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Tomorrow's the big one, the dual
meet with Cal. Unfortunately for the
Stanford track team, the Bears will
probably win.
Led by freshman sprinter Atlee
Mahorn, a deep California squad will
be able to score in most of the events.
Stanford will be forced to give up big
points in the sprints and the men's
throws and probably won't be able to
cover the stronger Cal squad.
"Their mens' team is one of the
best in the country, and their
women's team, which we barely
squeaked by last year, is vastly im
proved," Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson said.
Stanford is talented, but not deep,
which has posed a problem all year
long, because it takes depth to win
dual meets.
Consequently, Johnson sees to
morrow's contest as a tune-up for the
conference meet and a chance to
prepare for next year. With one of the
best recruiting classes ever headed to
the Farm, next season should be a
better one for Cardinal track.
"We're as good as we could've

hoped to be at this stage of the
game," Johnson said. "Now we'd like
to set a base, a foundation of excel
lence for the incoming class. We'd
like them to see that excellence is
what's normal here."
With tomorrow's team results al
most wrapped up, Johnson will be
able to avoid doubling up his better
runners to score points, a move which
will allow them to concentrate on
qualifying for the NCAAs in their
best events.
Ceci Hopp, Alison Wiley, Kim
Stevens and Jeff Atkinson, four of the
team's distance stars, have yet to
qualify. Johnson said he hopes that
will change tomorrow.
Hopp and Wiley, two former
NCAA champions, and Stevens, a
freshman, will be running primarily
against the clock, while Atkinson,
who placed seventh in last year's
NCAA 1,500 meter race, will have
some competition from Cal.
Atkinson's challenge will come
from the Bear's Jay Marden, another
of the country's top middle distance
runners. According to Johnson, Mar
den has run faster than Atkinson this
year, but the difference between
them is negligible.

Anna Sanchez strikes a typical pose for the weak-hitting Stanford softball team. The
squad has managed to score only two runs against the Arizona schools in four games this
year although one contest was a 1-0 Stanford win over Arizona.
