"Some of the kids were talking," Stanford Coach Cathy
Lincoln said of her 5-28 softball team. "They decided we
should have an extra category — wins, losses, ties and
moral victories."
When the Cardinal takes on third-ranked Arizona State
in a twilight twinbill tonight in Tempe, Ariz, a moral vic
tory is about all the squad could hope for.
"The last 1 saw, they were 23-13-1," Lincoln said of the
Sun Devils. "They're very good. They're a solid club. Two
or three of their players are leading the league in hitting.
The Pacific 10 Conference leader in hitting is Sun Devil
senior Kathy Escarcega, who is batting a hefty .444.
"She's a speedy outfielder," Stanford's Kathy Domin
guez said of the Arizona State centerfielder. "She's little,
and she just belts the ball."
"She's a threat to steal, and she's also a power hitter,"
Lincoln said.
The first time the two squads met, the Sun Devils
prevailed 5-0 in both games of the doubleheader.
"When we played them up here, we hit against them,"
Lincoln said. "I think we can hit them. It's just a matter of
getting the key hit at the right time."
In that earlier meeting Stanford was victimized by a late
Arizona State rally as has been the case in several games
this season for the Cardinal's two-person pitching staff. ■
"When they (opponents) get to the point where they've
seen our pitchers and can get their timing down, they can
hit them," Lincoln said.
A team which never did get its timing down against
Stanford was Arizona, and the Cardinal will meet the
Wildcats in a 1 p.m. doubleheader tomorrow.
Stanford earned its only Pac-10 victory ever in the
team's first meeting this season, when Lisa Buchanan shut
out the Wildcats 1-0 in the second game of a
doubleheader. '
Arizona had taken the first game 2-1 before Buchanan
shackled the Wildcats on two hits and made Kathy
Dominguez' run-scoring single stand up.
"We beat them the first time, and we'll try to do it
again" Dominguez said of 11th ranked Arizona. "We
really want to go down and win. We're not their favorite
team."
"U of A is going to be gunning for us because we em
barrassed them," Buchanan said.
Buchanan and Betsy Watson will take the mound in
both doubleheaders for the Cardinal this weekend.
The Stanford squad has had more than its share of hard
times this season, but, as the year winds down, the players
and their coach remain upbeat.
"We're hanging in there," Lincoln said. "The attitude is
good. We've been playing good ball."
"If we play defensively as well as we have been, we
should be alright," Buchanan said.
