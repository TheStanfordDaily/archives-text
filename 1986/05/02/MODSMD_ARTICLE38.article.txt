Meanwhile, the Cardinal has been
bolstered by the return of senior Jim

Grabb defeated Marty Laurendeau in
three sets during Stanford's 5-4 vic
tory over Pepperdine.
Joining Grabb at the top of the
Cardinal lineup will be senior Dan
Goldie and sophomore Patrick
McEnroe. Both Goldie and McEnroe
turned in impressive wins against
Pepperdine. Rounding out the Stan
ford squad are seniors John Letts and
Eric Rosenfeld, and junior Scott
Moody.
California will be counting on good
performances from senior Peter
Wright, who upset Pepperdine's
13th-ranked Kelly Jones on Wednes
day, and from freshman Alex Nizet
and Woody Hunt.
Sunday night several Stanford men
will face Cal again in a 6:30 p.m.
mixed match in Maples Pavilion.
