# Kimble, Gathers to leave Trojans
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Fresh
men basketball players Bo Kimble
and Hank Gathers have asked to be
released from their scholarships at
USC and their requests were granted,
the school announced yesterday.
The action came three days after
Coach George Raveling had in
formed the pair, who are both from
Philadelphia, and Tom Lewis, who is
from nearby Santa Ana, that their
scholarships would not be renewed
next fall.
Raveling was appointed as the
Trojans' coach on March 27,
succeeding Stan Morrison, and had
given the trio until April 25 to decide
whether they were going to remain at
the Pacific 10 Conference school.
The trio had expressed unhappi
ness when it was announced that
Morrison wouldn't return as head
coach and said they might transfer to
another school.
When no decision was announced
by the trio, Raveling took his action,
informing them by letter that their

scholarships wouldn't be renewed.
The trio had been given the right of
appeal, but yesterday's action by
Kimble and Gathers means they will
definitely transfer to another school.
Kimble and Gathers made their re
quest in writing to Athletic Director
Dr. Mike McGee, who immediately
granted it.
Lewis, a 6-foot-7 forward who led
the Trojans in scoring last season with
a 17.6-point average, was quoted
after receiving Raveling's letter as
saying he would make a statement
after final examinations had been
completed.
Kimble, a 6-4 guard, was the third
leading scorer for USC last season,
averaging 12.1 points. Gathers, a 6-7
forward, averaged 8.3 points and 5.1
rebounds.
Unless a decision to the contrary is
made, Kimble and Gathers will have
to sit out next year, and each will
have three years of college eligibility
remaining.
