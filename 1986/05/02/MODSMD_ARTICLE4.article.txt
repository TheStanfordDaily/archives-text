Members of El Centro Chicano declared their
Old Union offices a sanctuary for Central Ameri
can refugees last night during a screening of
"Latino," a film about the hostilities in Nicaragua.
Rudy Fuentes, a member of El Centro and a
Council of Presidents member-elect, announced
that "because of the severity of the problems of
Central American refugees, El Centro declares it
self a sanctuary."
In a related event, residents of American Studies
declared their house a sanctuary at a Wednesday
night house meeting, according to Andy Frisch, a
house resident and member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents.
Fuentes, speaking to a cheering capacity crowd
at Cubberley Auditorium, praised sanctuary move
ments across the United States and called for mem

bers of the audience to support such movements.
He applauded many groups for their dedication but
said, "Most of all, we respect efforts of refugees in
seeking asylum from political persecution in their
own countries."
While El Centro will not provide housing for
refugees, the group pledged to provide financial
aid through fund raising and to organize forums to
educate the public on the situation in Latin
America, Fuentes said.
"I feel that the support for the sanctuary move
ment here has grown tremendously in the last year,
but beyond support we need to provide some sort
of program to educated people on issues which
challenge our basic beliefs," he said.
George Cuevas, an El Centro staff worker and
an ASSU senator-elect, said El Centro decided to
make its declaration at the screening of "Latino"
"because (the movie) presents a good look at the
situation in Nicaragua and because this screening

involves a lot of people."
Residents of American Studies declared their
house a sanctuary late Wednesday night.
At a house meeting, 34 of the 50 residents of
American Studies voted on a proposal to declare
the house a sanctuary. Twenty-two house mem
bers, a majority of those present at the meeting,
voted in favor of the proposal.
Lowell Unger, a house member who favored the
proposal, said last night that while American
Studies will not house refugees, it will take several
steps to support the sanctuary movement.
"Those in the house who favor sanctuary will
start soon to tutor refugees in English, to organize a
letter campaign to change U.S. immigration policy,
to find food and clothing for local refugees and
raise money for a bail fund for refugees in jail," he
said.
