# Rose laments Reds' slump

CINCINNATI (AP) â€” Player-manager Pete Rose
can't remember the last time a Cincinnati Reds team
has endured such a harsh April.
"1 remember the best start. I don't remember the
worst start," said Rose, in his 18th season with the
Reds. "You try to forget those things."
It's guaranteed he will remember this start. The
Reds' 5-12 record is the worst in the major leagues and
the worst single-month mark since Rose returned as
player-manager in August 1984.
The bailclub that many picked to win the National
League West has fallen in stature in just three and a
half tortuous weeks. The Reds have lost five in a row
and nine of their last 10, failing to score on three of
their last four games.
When the pitching is good, the hitting isn't there.
When a few runs go on the scoreboard, the pitchers
give them right back.
Those budding pennant dreams are being killed by
the springtime frostings from opponents.
"When it rains, it pours and I'm drowning," Rose la
mented Wednesday, after an 8-0 embarrassment
against the Montreal Expos. "I'm a little confused
now. You guys got any suggestions? I'll take 'em from
anvbody."

How bad are things in Cincinnati?
Some batting averages: Buddy Bell, .157, Dave
Concepcion, .175, Eric Davis, .185, Nick Esasky, .196,
Ron Oester, .200. Rose has gone 0-for-10 and hitless
for April.
The pitching has been nothing to pin pennant hopes
on, either. The starting rotation consists of Mario Soto:
3.86 earned run average, eight homers allowed, includ
ing four in one inning Tuesday; Bill Gullickson: 3.10
ERA; John Denny: 4.50 ERA; and Tom Browning:
6.08 ERA.
The bullpen features John Franco: two saves, 3.46
ERA; and Ted Power: no saves, two losses, 6.00 ERA.
The cause is obvious to one player no longer on the
team. Montreal pitcher Jay Tibbs, who shut the Reds
out on four hits Wednesday, think it is a case of crum
bling under great expectations.
"They're really struggling now," said Tibbs, sent to
Montreal over the winter in the Gullickson trade.
"They put so much pressure on themselves to win the
division. They made all those trades, and all you heard
all winter was, 'We're going to win it.' They still could.
But it's a little tough to win games when you put all the
pressure on yourselves."
