May Day violence and strikes
Workers throughout the world marked the international May Day
yesterday with peaceful marches, as well as strikes in South Africa and
violence in Poland and the Philippines (please see related stories, this
page).
In West Germany, nearly a million people staged traditional May Day
rallies, with calls to protect workers rights and for peace and disarma
ment.
In Warsaw, police broke up a demonstration march in support of the
banned Solidarity trade union movement. Nearby, Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski opened an official May Day rally with attacks on the
United States' "provocative atomic explosions" and arms buildup.
He made no mention of the Soviet nuclear reactor disaster at Cher
nobyl, radioactive fallout from which is polluting northern Poland.
In Moscow, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, President Andrei
Gromyko and other members of the Kremlin leadership stood on the
Lenin Mausoleum to watch a two-hour parade.
In a May Day message, the Soviets appealed to "the people of the
world" to resist the "imperialistic danger of a nuclear war" and renewed
calls for a ban on nuclear testing and the militarization of space.
Chinese leaders called in speeches and through the press for their
countrymen to put complete faith in the success of economic reform
policies and to improve their specialist qualifications.
In Tehran, thousands of Iranian workers in military uniforms paraded
through the streets. Similar gatherings were reported in other cities, to
gether with statements of support for the war effort against Iraq, the of
ficial Iranian news agency reported.
In France, most people took advantage of fine spring weather to make
holiday outings. Labor rallies called by trade unions were kept to a mini
mum, with only few hundred workers joining a march in Paris.
A businessman in Perigueux in southwest France took his electrical
company's 11 employees on a vacation to the Spanish Mediterranenan
island of Majorca as a gesture of thanks for their "hard work."
In Ankara, the depiction of May 1 as the International Labor Day by
the opposition leader caused loud protests and scuffles in the Turkish
Parliament. A remark by Chairman Aydin Guven Gurkan of the So
cial Democratic Populist Party that "Labor Day is the only true event
which links the peoples of the world without any need for national or re
ligious affinities" triggered desk-banging protests from government
deputies.
The Labor Day, which brought out red flags in massive rallies in Istan
bul during the 19705, had witnessed a massacre in 1977 in which 34 per
sons were shot or trampled to death.
Two years later the celebrations were suspended by martial law auth
orities and they were banned altogether after the 1980 military coup.
60 Marcos supporters are arrested
MANILA, Philippines — Riot troops fired tear-gas grenades and
water cannon and arrested more than 60 supporters of former President
Ferdinand Marcos after rioting broke out yesterday between thousands
of Marcos loyalists and supporters of President Corazon Aquino.
It was the biggest episode of street violence since Aquino came to
power two months ago. At least 33 persons were injured, two with gun
shot wounds, during the hourlong street battles, which authorities said
destroyed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property in the
heart of Manila's tourist district.
The violence erupted just a few hundred feet from a downtown park
where Aquino was addressing tens of thousands of union leaders and
workers during the country's annual May Day celebration.
Aquino made no mention of the violence in her speech, in which she
granted major new concessions to organized labor in the Philippines.
One top aide said the president was unaware of the nearby rioting while
she was speaking.
It was not clear what sparked the rock- and bottle-throwing between
the two groups, but friends of the deposed president said that Marcos
personally had warned them by telephone several days ago to remain at
home yesterday "because there will be trouble in the streets."
The main group involved in the rioting had broken away from a near
permanent. anti-government demonstration by Marcos loyalists outside
the U.S. Embassy. For the past three weeks, the loyalists have been
staging a day and night protest on the busy boulevard, yelling obscenities
at passing foreigners and posting signs condemning the Reagan adminis
tration for its role in the Feb. 25 civilian and military coup that drove
Marcos into exile in Hawaii.
Aquino's government has charged that Marcos aides in Manila are
paying each of the protesters $2.50 a day to maintain their angry vigil,
but Aquino said she would allow the protest to continue because it
demonstrates that democracy has returned to the Philippines.
Sikh extremists driven from temple
NEW DELHI, India — Indian police commandos drove Sikh ex
tremists from the Golden Temple in Amritsar but failed to arrest any of
the main leaders, the police official who coordinated the 13-hour opera
tion conceded yesterday.
"All of the ringleaders have escaped," Punjab state police director
general J.F. Ribeiro said. He said the leaders, who seized the temple —
the holiest in Sikhdom — in January and have used it since as a base for
a Sikh separatist movement, slipped through police lines Wednesday
night because "they are masters of disguise. "
However, with several hundred extremists forced to leave the temple
and 300 people arrested, the raid was hailed as a victory for Prime Mini
ster Rajiv Gandhi, who approved the action, and for the moderate Sikh
government of Punjab, India's richest state. The prime minister's
mother, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by
members of her security detail after ordering an Indian army raid on the
temple two years ago in which several hundred people, mostly Sikhs,
were killed.
Ribeiro claimed that only one person died in Wednesday's operation.
However, extremist leader Harrinder Singh Kahlon, who escaped
during the raid but delivered a statement to reporters in Amritsar later,
claimed that six Sikhs were killed and more than 25 injured in the police
action. Kahlon. who is still being sought by police, claimed the attack
"by the exploitive and barbarous rule of Delhi" was an attempt to make
"willing slaves" out of India's 15 million Sikhs, the majority of whom
live in Punjab state.
Throughout India, many political leaders yesterday praised Gandhi
and Punjab Chief Minister Surgit Singh Barnala, head of the moderate
Sikh political party Akali Dal, for the relatively peaceful operation.
Police commanders said they were able to frighten the extremists with
loud but generally harmless stun grenades and then rout them from the
temple grounds.
Under instructions from Barnala, they entered the temple grounds
barefooted and wore cloth coverings over their hair, signs of respect
practiced by Sikhs for the temple.
According to journalists in Amritsar, security men continued to guard
the temple last night. The city remained under curfew and the usually
bustling streets were quiet.
30 die in Salvadoran plane crash
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — At least 30 persons were killed
when a Salvadoran military plane crashed here yesterday.
Reports said the accident took place immediately after the DC-6
aircraft had taken off from San Salvador.
Initial reports said 35 persons, all members of the Central American
country's Air Force, were on board.
