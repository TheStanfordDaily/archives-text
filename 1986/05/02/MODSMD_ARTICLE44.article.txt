# Meltdown probably occurred

WASHINGTON — U.S. officials
now appear certain that the Soviet
Union's Chernobyl nuclear power
plant experienced a massive core
meltdown. They also said they
believe the nuclear accident was
confined to a single reactor and that
the fire at the site in the Ukraine may
have been extinguished.
But a Soviet Embassy official, in an
extraordinary appearance before a
congressional committee here, made
it clear that the Soviets' problems are
not over. The problem at Chernobyl,
he testified, "has not been liquidated
yet."
Some officials in the Reagan Ad
ministration appeared to back away
from earlier statements that hundreds
of people may have been killed in the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant acci
dent. Immediate casualties were
probably confined to those working
at the plant, and many in the normal
work force of 250 were probably
evacuated from the site before the
catastrophic fire and explosion, some
officials now believe.
But the officials stressed that they
still do not know the level of radiation
in the area surrounding the plant,
which is near the large city of Kiev,

and so cannot predict how many
people will suffer long-term health
damage. One official said that
satellite photographs show tourist
boats continuing to ply the river near
the plant and soccer games taking
place within a few miles of it.
The nuclear accident, described as
the worst ever, apparently began last
Friday, but the Soviet Union did not
announce it until Sweden detected
abnormal levels of airborne radioac
tivity on Monday.

Confirmation of the meltdown
came from scientists at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in
California and was based an analysis
of the emissions from the accident.
"The core is gone," said one
Livermore official. Previous reports
on the extent of the meltdown had
been more speculative.
The testimony of Vitaliy Churkin, a
second secretary of the Soviet Em
bassy here, was given at a hearing of
the House energy, conservation and

power subcommittee. During fre
quently testy exchanges with mem
bers of the subcommittee, Churkin
would not say whether the fire has
been extinguished, but appeared to
indicate that it continues to burn.
Churkin, saying the Soviets have
been "very forthcoming," bristled at
suggestions that his government
misled the world about the severity of
the accident and misled its own popu
lation about the danger of radiation.
He said two people were killed in the
accident and 197 injured, 18 of them
seriously.
One knowledgeable U.S. official
said the Soviet casualty figures are
now thought possibly to be correct,
although the Administration contin
ues to harbor considerable skep
ticism.
Officials said they believe that radi
ation levels in the Chernobyl area,
given the severity of the fire and
blast, must be high enough to warrant
a greater evacuation than the Soviets
appear to have ordered.
But Churkin told the House sub
committee that all those affected
"were well aware of what has hap
pened."
"They won't even have to pay
medical bills," he added.
