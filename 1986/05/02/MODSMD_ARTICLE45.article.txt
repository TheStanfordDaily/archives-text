# Work stoppage in S. Africa
## 
### 
DURBAN, South Africa — Most of South
Africa came to a standstill yesterday as nearly 2
million black workers marked the 100 th anniver
sary of May Day with the biggest work stoppage in
the country's history.
While the call for a general strike to protest
apartheid came mainly from the radical Congress
of South African Trade Unions, 60,000 supporters
of the moderate Zulu leader Chief Gatsha But
helezi packed a sports stadium in this Indian Ocean
city to launch a rival union strongly opposed to the
congress' call for foreign disinvestment.
One of the most crippling work stoppages was in
South Africa's main industrial and mining region of
the Witwatersrand, centered on Johannesburg. An
independent body of specialists called the Labor
Monitoring Group estimated that eight out of 10
black workers there had responded to the call for a
general strike.
There was a 100 percent stoppage in the eastern
Cape Province, traditional stronghold of the black
activist movements and the scene of the most per
sistent racial unrest over the past 21 months, the
monitoring group reported.

It estimated there had been a 70 percent
stoppage in Natal province, but said the response
had been poorer in western Cape Province, around
Cape Town.
The main employers' organization in the
country, the Association of Chambers of Com
merce, agreed with these estimates, describing the
response to the strike call as "massive."
"Without doubt this is the biggest nationwide
work stoppage South Africa has had," said Vincent
Brett, the chamber's manpower secretary.
Brett added that blacks in the Witwatersrand
area who wanted to work had been unable to be
cause transport services from the segregated tow
ships had come to a standstill.
There was a total absence of bus drivers, he said,
and train services from Johannesburg's big Soweto
township had been disrupted by a fire — thought to
be sabotage — that burned out two passenger cars
early yesterday morning.
The action was regarded as a test of strength by
the 650,000-member union congress, known by its
acronym of Cosatu, which was formed only five

months ago as South Africa's biggest federation of
black labor unions.
It also was regarded as a trial run for a three-day
stoppage planned for June 16, 17 and 18 to mark
the 10th anniversary of the 1976 Soweto riots.
Black activist organizations are looking to the
June strike call as the central event in this years
anti-apartheid campaigning.
The union congress has aligned itself publicly
with the United Democratic Front, the main alli
ance of activist organizations in the black majority
population. Congress president Elijah Barayi also
held talks recently with exiled leaers of the
outlawed African National Congress.
The congress has also declared itself strongly in
favor of economic sanctions, including disinvest
ment, as a way of pressuring the Pretoria govern
ment into abandoning apartheid and white
minority rule.
Soon after the congress was formed, Buthelezi
announced his intention to launch a rival union
rather than have members of his Zulu-based In
katha movement belong to member unions of the
federation that was bad-mouthing him.
