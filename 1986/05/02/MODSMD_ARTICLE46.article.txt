Activists are convicted
TUCSON, Ariz. — Eight sanctuary movement
activists — including a co-founder of the
nationwide effort to help illegal aliens fleeing
Central America — were convicted yesterday of
16 felony charges stemming from their church
based activities, but three were acquitted
by a U.S. District Court jury here.
Ever defiant, the 11 defendants were cheered
by supporters as they left the courthouse after the
intricately woven verdicts that ended a six-month
trial but not, they said, the sanctuary movement.
"No, I have no regrets," said Darlene Nic
gorski, 41, a Roman Catholic nun who was con
victed of five felonies, each carrying the possibil
ity of a five-year prison term. "There have been
other cases in history where people had to stand
up to be a Christian," she said.
But in Washington, Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Alan Nel
son issued a statement saying: "Above all, this
case has demonstrated that no group, no matter
how well meaning or highly motivated, can arbi
trarily violate the laws of the United States.. ..
Perhaps now that this verdict is behind us, those
of the 'sanctuary' movement can redirect their
energies in a manner that is within the law."

U.S. reactor vulnerable
RICHLAND, Wash. — The federal govern
ment's nuclear reactor here may experience se
vere cooling problems and possibly even a
meltdown unless measures are taken to upgrade
safety features and critical parts that are wearing
out at the 23-year-old, weapons-producing plant,
according to two Department of Energy reports.
The warnings of potential problems at the
Hanford Government Reservation facility
surfaced yesterday as concern grew over the
safety of several U.S. nuclear plants that, like the
Chernobyl facility in the Soviet Union, do not
have containment structures to prevent release of
radioactivity.
The Hanford plant, about 35 miles from here,
is further similar to the Chernobyl plant in that it
also uses graphite as a moderating agent to con
trol the rate of nuclear reaction. The so-called N
reactor also generates some electricity.
Rocket launch delayed
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The launching
of an unmanned Delta rocket carrying a weather
satellite was scrubbed by NASA yesterday, after

a small quantity of kerosene-type fuel was dis
covered leaking past a valve in the main engine
system.
The launching, the first scheduled from the
Cape Canaveral area since the ill-fated space
shuttle Challenger exploded Jan. 28, was
postponed until tomorrow, NASA spokesman
George Diller said.
The delay was announced less than three hours
before the scheduled 6:18 p.m. EDT liftoff of the
three-stage Delta rocket at Cape Canaveral Air
force Station.
Diller said that engineers discovered the leak
while going through standard test procedures.
About a quarter-cup of RPI, a kerosene-type
fuel used by the first-stage rocket, had leaked
past a valve in the main engine.
Market closes lower
NEW YORK — Stock prices dropped yester
day for the third time this week in reaction to
more economic bad news and uncertainties about
the Soviet nuclear disaster, but the selloff was
less severe than in the previous session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
fell 6.20 points to 1,777.78, one day after Wall
Street's best-known index plunged 41.91.
