Soviets will accept help
LOS ANGELES — The Soviet Union, suffer
ing from a nuclear accident near Kiev, has ac
cepted an offer of international medical help pro
vided through American industrialist Dr. Ar
mand Hammer, doctors announced yesterday.
The Soviets previously had sought only limited
outside assistance.
The new offer makes available the substantial
resources of the International Bone Marrow
Registry to the Soviet Union as well as the ex
pertise of Dr. Robert Gale, chairman of the
registry and a leading bone marrow transplant
surgeon who practices at UCLA.
Gale, leading an international medical team,
left for Moscow yesterday.
Irradiation and destruction of bone marrow is
one of the major consequences of a nuclear acci
dent, which may result in death in two to four
weeks from those who suffer from radiation ex
posure, he said.
Those steps, he said, would include determin
ing the number of people exposed to potentially
fatal doses of radiation, then overseeing massive

international efforts to locate suitable bone mar
row donors and perform transplants.
Surprises in spy trial
LOS ANGELES — A Russian woman who
has dropped a series of bombshells at Richard
Miller's spy trial hatched another surprise yester
day, saying she had secretly confessed the former
FBI agent gave her classified documents destined
for the Soviets.
Svetlana Ogorodnikov, the star defense wit
ness, admitted under cross-examination that she
feared her family in the Soviet Union would be
harmed if she confessed publicly that Miller, her
lover, gave her the documents.
Defense attorneys said they were unaware that
such a statement had been made until Assistant
U.S. Attorney Russell Hayman asked a question
about it yeterday.
They asked for a mistrial, saying they had been
denied crucial information that would have
allowed them to plot strategy in Miller's
espionage case. The judge denied the motion.

Spy was warned by spy
SAN FRANCISCO — Confessed spy John
Walker said yesterday he warned Jerry Whit
worth they could both be assassinated if the
former Navy radioman kept changing his career
plans.
Walker said he told Whitworth signing up for a
three-year job and quitting after one year, as
Whitworth had just done on his final Navy as
signment aboard the carrier USS Enterprise,
"could be dangerous to one's health."
He did not say when he gave the warning, but
it apparently would have been sometime after
Whitworth retired from the Navy in October
1983. Walker testified earlier that Whitworth
spoke at various times after his retirement of
either re-enlisting or getting a government job
with access to classified material.
