# Two professors receive science honors
## 
### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
Stanford professors Bradley Efron
and Charles Frake have been elected
to the National Academy of Sciences,
one of the highest honors that can be
accorded an American scientist or en
gineer.
Efron, a professor of statistics and
head of the program in mathematical
science, said the election, which was
announced Tuesday, was the most
satisfying award he has ever received.
"It really feels nice because you get
elected by your fellow scientists," he
said, adding, "1 was really surprised
because 1 didn't feel anyone was

noticing what I was doing."
The 47-year-old Efron is respon
sible for developing the "bootstrap
theory" of statistics, which makes use
of a computer to replace elementary
statistical formulae.
Efron was dismissed from Stanford
as a graduate student in 1961 for
editing an issue of the Chaparral
magazine entitled "Layboy."
"1 strayed beyond the boundaries
of good taste ... bad taste, in fact,"
Efron said.
He returned to Stanford after six
months and received his doctorate in
1964. "1 was trained here completely
at Stanford and this award gives me a

chance to justify my professors' faith
in me, in particular Herb Solomon
and the late Rupert Miller, who
passed away last month," he said.
Also elected to the academy was
Anthropology Prof. Charles Frake.
Frake, who graduated from Stanford
in 1951, has been a member of the
faculty since 1960.
Frake, who lives on a a boat at
Santa Cruz, is well known for teach
ing the popular undergraduate
courses "Peoples of the Pacific,"
"Maritime Cultures of the World"
and "Culture and Astronomy."
His research in a "thropology and
linguistics has taken him to the south

ern Philippines and eastern In
donesia.
Frake, who will be on sabbatical
next year doing research with a Na
tional Science Foundation grant,
could not be reached for comment
last night.
With the addition of Efron and
Frake, Stanford now has 79 faculty
members who have been elected to
the National Academy of Sciences,
not including two scholars affiliated
with the Hoover Institution.
UC-Berkeley had six members
elected to the academy this year, fol
lowed by MIT, Yale, Chicago and the
National Institutes of Health with
three each.
