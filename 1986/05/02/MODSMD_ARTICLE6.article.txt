# Lyons addresses Fac Sen on frats
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Recent incidents involving housed
fraternities at Stanford will probably
lead to revocation of housing
privileges, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons told members of the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
"1 think there's a likelihood (that
although) there are now 12 residen
tial all-male fraternities, there will be
fewer next year," Lyons said. "We're
winding in ways that don't always
make the headlines, but some of us
are fed up," he said. Lyons did not
identify specific fraternities at the
meeting.
During the last three weeks, both
the Delta Upsilon and Alpha Delta
Phi fraternities have been the subject
of investigations by the University
and the Interfraternity Council (IFC).
Lyons told The Daily last night that
at least five students are currently in
the University judicial process for
multiple incidents involving "matters
related to the Delta Upsilon frater
nity and their Rush."
The University is also investigating
a "troublesome record of drug abuse
(and) academic deficiency" by Alpha
Delt members, Lyons said last night.
The investigation could lead the
University to revoke recognition of
the fraternity, Diana Conklin, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Row, told The Daily
last week. If recognition is revoked,
the fraternity would lose its house.
During the meeting, University
President Donald Kennedy
responded to questions about the
incidents. "I am deeply distressed by
a number of the events that have
gone on," Kennedy said. "I cannot,
for the life of me, understand why
repeated warnings don't yield im
provement in that sector of under
graduate life at Stanford."
The IFC Review Board, the judi
cial arm of the IFC, voted last Tues
day to revoke recognition of the DUs
for two years. The IFC also recom
mended that the University disband
the fraternity and lake away its
house.
Both fraternities have disputed the
charges. On Wednesday, the DUs
formally appealed the IFC decision,
and the Alpha Delts have delivered a
report to the Office of Residential
Education denying the University's

allegatioas.
Kennedy praised the actions of the
IFC. "I think we're getting more
prompt, decisive and thoughtful con
sideration by the (IFC) with respect
to issues resolving those residences
and those kind of issues, although 1
wish they didn't have so much work
to do," Kennedy said.
Kennedy also addressed the con
cerns of Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy that the University may
be dragging its feet in implementing
its policies regarding University in
vestment in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
According to Abernethy, the Uni
versity Treasurer's Office has said the
Stanford stock portfolio contains 10
companies that have not signed the
Sullivan Principles and four that have
"come out badly" in a compliance as
sessments conducted by Arthur B.
Little, an independent research firm.
"There is considerable disagree
ment (about) whether the Sullivan
Codes amount to very much, but I
think there is wide agreement that
they constitute an absolute minimum
of behavior below which companies
should not fall," Abernethy said.
Companies have had sufficient
time to decide whether or not to com
ply with the code, Abernethy said,
adding that the Board of Trustees
has formally voted on investment
questions regarding the Sullivan
Principles since 1977.
"Stanford itself has had a long
tradition of publicly supporting com
pliance with the Sullivan codes,"
Abernethy said.
According to Kennedy, signing and
compliance are only two of the
criteria used by University commit
tees examining the merits of investing
in such companies.
"It has been the position of the C
IR (Commission on Investment
Responsiblity) and of the board that
failure to sign the Sullivan Principles
is not automatically cause for divest
ment, although it does change the
burden of proof to the companies that
fail to sign," Kennedy said.
The Special Trustee Committee on
Investment Responsibility (S-CIR)
and C-IR, a University committee,
are the two bodies responsible for ex
amining Stanford's stock portfolio.
Individual efforts by companies "to
recognize and support groups now
excluded from the political process
(and those which) actively work
against apartheid" are also consid
ered, Kennedy said.
When evaluating companies, the
C-IR takes into account a variety of
"affirmative effects," including
signature and adherence to the Sul
livan Principles as well as member
ship in the American Chamber of
Commerce and the U.S. Corporate
Council on South Africa, bodies that
have "made increasingly strong
representations" to the South African

government, Kennedy said.
Companies that have not signed
the Sullivan Principles but are in
cluded in the Stanford portfolio are
subject to ongoing C-IR investiga
tions, "some of which I hope are
winding to a close," Kennedy said.
"The process obviously has not
been fast enough to suit some," Ken
nedy said. "I think the feeling on the
C-IR (is) that it wants to be thorough
and . . . extend full opportunity to
those companies. Otherwise, it feels it
cannot make an effective case to the
S-CIR."
"It is my firm hope that there will
be action well before the end of this
year on a number of those compan
ies," Kennedy said.

James Lyons told members of the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
"1 think there's a likelihood (that
although) there are now 12 residen
tial all-male fraternities, there will be
fewer next year," Lyons said. "We're
winding in ways that don't always
make the headlines, but some of us
are fed up," he said. Lyons did not
identify specific fraternities at the
meeting.
During the last three weeks, both
the Delta Upsilon and Alpha Delta
Phi fraternities have been the subject
of investigations by the University
and the Interfraternity Council (IFC).
Lyons told The Daily last night that
at least five students are currently in
the University judicial process for
multiple incidents involving "matters
related to the Delta Upsilon frater
nity and their Rush."
The University is also investigating
a "troublesome record of drug abuse
(and) academic deficiency" by Alpha
Delt members, Lyons said last night.
The investigation could lead the
University to revoke recognition of
the fraternity, Diana Conklin, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Row, told The Daily
last week. If recognition is revoked,
the fraternity would lose its house.
During the meeting, University
President Donald Kennedy
responded to questions about the
incidents. "I am deeply distressed by
a number of the events that have
gone on," Kennedy said. "I cannot,
for the life of me, understand why
repeated warnings don't yield im
provement in that sector of under
graduate life at Stanford."
The IFC Review Board, the judi
cial arm of the IFC, voted last Tues
day to revoke recognition of the DUs
for two years. The IFC also recom
mended that the University disband
the fraternity and lake away its
house.
Both fraternities have disputed the
charges. On Wednesday, the DUs
formally appealed the IFC decision,
and the Alpha Delts have delivered a
report to the Office of Residential
Education denying the University's

allegatioas.
Kennedy praised the actions of the
IFC. "I think we're getting more
prompt, decisive and thoughtful con
sideration by the (IFC) with respect
to issues resolving those residences
and those kind of issues, although 1
wish they didn't have so much work
to do," Kennedy said.
Kennedy also addressed the con
cerns of Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy that the University may
be dragging its feet in implementing
its policies regarding University in
vestment in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
According to Abernethy, the Uni
versity Treasurer's Office has said the
Stanford stock portfolio contains 10
companies that have not signed the
Sullivan Principles and four that have
"come out badly" in a compliance as
sessments conducted by Arthur B.
Little, an independent research firm.
"There is considerable disagree
ment (about) whether the Sullivan
Codes amount to very much, but I
think there is wide agreement that
they constitute an absolute minimum
of behavior below which companies
should not fall," Abernethy said.
Companies have had sufficient
time to decide whether or not to com
ply with the code, Abernethy said,
adding that the Board of Trustees
has formally voted on investment
questions regarding the Sullivan
Principles since 1977.
"Stanford itself has had a long
tradition of publicly supporting com
pliance with the Sullivan codes,"
Abernethy said.
According to Kennedy, signing and
compliance are only two of the
criteria used by University commit
tees examining the merits of investing
in such companies.
"It has been the position of the C
IR (Commission on Investment
Responsiblity) and of the board that
failure to sign the Sullivan Principles
is not automatically cause for divest
ment, although it does change the
burden of proof to the companies that
fail to sign," Kennedy said.
The Special Trustee Committee on
Investment Responsibility (S-CIR)
and C-IR, a University committee,
are the two bodies responsible for ex
amining Stanford's stock portfolio.
Individual efforts by companies "to
recognize and support groups now
excluded from the political process
(and those which) actively work
against apartheid" are also consid
ered, Kennedy said.
When evaluating companies, the
C-IR takes into account a variety of
"affirmative effects," including
signature and adherence to the Sul
livan Principles as well as member
ship in the American Chamber of
Commerce and the U.S. Corporate
Council on South Africa, bodies that
have "made increasingly strong
representations" to the South African

government, Kennedy said.
Companies that have not signed
the Sullivan Principles but are in
cluded in the Stanford portfolio are
subject to ongoing C-IR investiga
tions, "some of which I hope are
winding to a close," Kennedy said.
"The process obviously has not
been fast enough to suit some," Ken
nedy said. "I think the feeling on the
C-IR (is) that it wants to be thorough
and . . . extend full opportunity to
those companies. Otherwise, it feels it
cannot make an effective case to the
S-CIR."
"It is my firm hope that there will
be action well before the end of this
year on a number of those compan
ies," Kennedy said.
Recent incidents involving housed
fraternities at Stanford will probably
lead to revocation of housing
privileges, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons told members of the
Faculty Senate yesterday.

tial all-male fraternities, there will be
