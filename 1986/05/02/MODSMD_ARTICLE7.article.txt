# Saponifiers' suds clean dirty clothes
## 
### VLADINA HESS Staff writer 
To most Stanford students,
"laundry" is a dirty word.
Literally.
Just mention the word, and cer
tain images come to mind: dirty
socks and T-shirts piling up in a
corner; hot, smelly basement
rooms full of washers and dryers
that rarely work as they're

6dtuf6

supposed to; fall-quarter freshmen
donning clothes that are three
sizes too small and a "new" shade
of white.
Well, no one need wear dirty
underwear again — Saponifiers, a
new laundry service for Stanford
students, will wash students'
clothes for a fee.
Saponifiers (to 'saponify' is to
convert into soap) is the idea of
senior Juliann Perrigo and first
year graduate student Hillary
Wood. The two began offering
laundry service last month and
said they plan to continue the ser
vice through the summer.
Wood and Perrigo got the idea
for a student laundry service one
night at dinner when brainstorm
ing about job possibilities on
campus. "I had wanted to do

something business-wise for a long
time," said Perrigo.
However, laying the
groundwork for the business was
no easy task, they agreed.
First, they called different
laundry services in the area to find
one that had both low rates and a
willingness to work with students.
They also did a cost-benefit analy
sis and surveyed students to see if
their idea was feasible.
After a few weeks of organiza
tion, Wood and Perrigo were
ready to take their idea to the
public.
Basically, Wood and Perrigo
coordinate the services between
the laundromat and the students.
The two take orders over the
phone, arrange pick-ups and
deliveries and handle SaponifieiV
advertising.
And that advertising is the key
to their business, according to Per
rigo. " Advertising is really impor
tant to us," she said, noting that it
is particularly important in the
beginning stages of the service.
According to Wood,
Saponifiers' advertising strategy is
to have "maximum exposure at
minimum cost." So far, this has
meant printing up fliers to dis
tribute almost everywhere on
campus: on car windshields, under
dorm doors and on dinner tables at
residences.
"Little did we know that our Stan
ford education would entail learning
how to disseminate fliers," said
Wood. However, the two admitted
such exhaustive advertising methods
were tiresome.
"I really got to hate windshield
wipers," said Perrigo.
Perrigo said they want to make
their advertising "catchy." The two
have "lots of ideas," according to
Wood, and one of their more innova
tive strategies was to hang laundry
from the arches at the entrance to the
Quad and some campus sculptures.
Both said their jobs were interest
ing. "It's different from what I ex
pected," Perrigo said. "[Being an
'entrepreneur'] can seem glamorous,
but people don't talk about the hard
work that goes on behind the scenes."
"This could easily be a full-time
job," Perrigo said, adding that she
works about 20-hours-per-week. She
also said she foresees the need for ad
ditional employees in the future.
According to Wood, Saponifiers
needs a high volume of business in or
der to be profitable. "We're getting
no profit [on some of our services],"
she said.
Saponifiers provides a variety of
laundry services that include dry
cleaning, "full-load" service and free
pick-up and delivery.
"Our goal is to do a good job,"
Wood said.
