To most Stanford students,
"laundry" is a dirty word.
Literally.
Just mention the word, and cer
tain images come to mind: dirty
socks and T-shirts piling up in a
corner; hot, smelly basement
rooms full of washers and dryers
that rarely work as they're

supposed to; fall-quarter freshmen
donning clothes that are three
sizes too small and a "new" shade
of white.
Well, no one need wear dirty
underwear again â€” Saponifiers, a
new laundry service for Stanford
students, will wash students'
clothes for a fee.
Saponifiers (to 'saponify' is to
convert into soap) is the idea of
senior Juliann Perrigo and first
year graduate student Hillary
Wood. The two began offering
laundry service last month and
said they plan to continue the ser
vice through the summer.
Wood and Perrigo got the idea
for a student laundry service one
night at dinner when brainstorm
ing about job possibilities on
campus. "I had wanted to do

something business-wise for a long
time," said Perrigo.
However, laying the
groundwork for the business was
no easy task, they agreed.
First, they called different
laundry services in the area to find
one that had both low rates and a
willingness to work with students.
They also did a cost-benefit analy
sis and surveyed students to see if
their idea was feasible.
After a few weeks of organiza
tion, Wood and Perrigo were
ready to take their idea to the
public.
Basically, Wood and Perrigo
coordinate the services between
the laundromat and the students.
The two take orders over the
phone, arrange pick-ups and
deliveries and handle SaponifieiV
advertising.
And that advertising is the key
to their business, according to Per
rigo. " Advertising is really impor
tant to us," she said, noting that it
is particularly important in the
beginning stages of the service.
According to Wood,
Saponifiers' advertising strategy is
to have "maximum exposure at
minimum cost." So far, this has
meant printing up fliers to dis
tribute almost everywhere on
