# Activist to perform tonight
## 
### SUSAN GREIM 
Barbara George is very con
cerned about nuclear issues. But
she goes about voicing her concern
in an innovative and entertaining
way.
An activist since 1978, George
puts on a one-woman comedy and
horror show called, "Everything I
Ever Wanted to Ask About Nukes
and Was Afraid to Know."
After three years of performing,
George, a Stanford graduate, talks
fondly of her audience.
"Afterwards they come up and
thank me, tell me they were moved,

and ask how they can help," she
says.
During her performance, George
transforms herself into a variety of
characters â€” she tells the story of a
woman from H-bombed Bikini Is-,
land, delivers a crash course in radi
ation basics and presents geological
history from the viewpoint of a
wandering uranium atom.
George trained at Chicago's
Second City cabaret before per
forming nationwide at conferences
sponsored by the National Nuclear
Weapons Freeze Campaign, con
sumer activist Ralph Nader's Criti
cal Mass and the New York
Women's Studies Association.

In 1983, George toured 6,000
miles with a full-sized replica of a
cruise missile on the top of her
truck.
George will be performing
tonight at 9 n.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium iiie audience is
welcome to cor .i rly or stay after
the show to u. .<-,3 nuclear issues
with local organizers and George,
who considers herself a "living
newsletter" of the national peace
movement.
Her appearance is being spon

Action for Nuclear Disarmament
(STAND).
