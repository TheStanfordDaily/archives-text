## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Respect ally's nuke ban 
### 
When the New Zealand government denied a U.S.
naval ship entrance to one of its harbors early last
year, it took a daring stand against its long-time super
power ally. If New Zealand passes legislation later this
year that would ban all possibly nuclear-armed or
-powered ships from its harbors, it would confirm a
heroic commitment against a nuclear New Zealand.
However, by prohibiting docking priviliges to ships
suspected of being nuclear-powered or of carrying nu
clear weapons, New Zealand will risk its mutual
defense alliance with the United States and Australia,
the so-called Anzus treaty. The Reagan Administra
tion this week made it clear that it considers New
Zealand's decision a "material breach" of the 35-year
old treaty, and that it would formally renounce the
agreement if the South Pacific nation passes proposed
legislation in August. The United States has stated that
it will not change its policy of not revealing which of its
ships carry nuclear material.
Despite the conflict, neither country can be faulted
for its decisions.
Both countries are taking difficult, yet responsible,
stands on the issue. In New Zealand, there is a heavy
anti-nuclear sentiment and a huge movement to make
the nation a nuclear-free zone. To overlook the
popular will in favor of pleasing a strong ally would be
a crime.
Yet, the United States has made a strong commit
ment to a nuclear navy and has valid reasons for not re
vealing which ships are nuclear-powered or carry nu
clear weapons. The policy of nuclear deterrence rests

on secrecy, and revealing the contents of ships would
allow enemies to know which vessels they should
target. To overlook this vital secrecy to placate an ally
would be wrong.
What each nation must now remember is that the
separate paths they have taken have been the correct
ones, and that every nation has different needs. New
Zealand must not ignore the wishes of its people, and
the United States must not ignore its defense commit
ments to other countries.
Most imprortantly, the United States must refrain
from punishing New Zealand for its decision. Immedi
ately after last year's incident, in which the U.S.
destroyer Buchanan was denied docking priviliges be
cause the United States would not reveal whether the
ship was carrying nuclear material, the Reagan Admin
istration suspended scheduled naval maneuvers with
New Zealand and withheld intelligence information
normally shared with allies. Surely, New Zealand must
have anticipated the U.S. response and decided
that it could risk loss of U.S. military support, but the
U.S. decision to punish New Zealand was a mistake.
To impose any further military or economic sanc
tions would be an even graver error. There is no need
to alter the U.S. relationship with New Zealand any
more than to rework the Anzus pact to accommodate
the needs of both nations.
The inconvenience to the U S. military should be
offset by pride in that country's commitment to a
peaceful South Pacific. New Zealand's refusal to allow
nuclear ships to enter its ports is no reason to abandon
that nation as an ally.
