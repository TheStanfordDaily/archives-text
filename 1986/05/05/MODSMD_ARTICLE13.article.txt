Sanctuary effort
seeks bail funds
We were encouraged by the stu
dent vote for the sanctuary referen
dum. We now wish to challenge those
students who voted "yes" to un
dertake more than a symbolic
gesture. The needs of Central Ameri
can refugees and the sanctuary move
ment are great. Locally there are
growing needs for food, housing,
health, jobs, education and a variety
of other supportive services. We urge
students to become involved in pro
viding refugees these basic human
needs, thereby giving concrete ex
pression to the symbolic act of voting
for sanctuary.
However, the singularly most
pressing need is for bail money. If one
wants to act in a manner that practi
cally helps to save a refugee's life, al
beit for a short time, one should
become involved in raising bail
money for those who have been in
carcerated. Once bail has been
posted, a refugee is under the protec
tion of the law until the conclusion of
his or her trial. If bail cannot be
raised, the refugee can be subject to
immediate deportation. Presently we
are in the process of raising $3,500
for William Fabrica Trinidad, a 16-
year-old boy from El Salvador who is
detained by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. He is one of
six brothers: the older brothers were
killed by military forces in El Sal
vador in their home. His next brother
is among the many who have disap
peared, and his two younger brothers
live with his mother in Los Angeles.
Fortunately, we have been able to se

cure a loan for the money to post
bond and prevent him from being
deported to El Salvador, at least until
his case is heard in court.
We ask the administration, the fac
ulty, the staff and the students to
please join us in our bail project.

Masculinity tax?
I am glad to see that The Daily's
abortion editorial has encouraged
more members of the community to
speak up on this complex issue, James
Roche's recent letter (Daily, April
29) being a case in point. Roche is,
apparently, against legal abortions
(and thus, alas, for illegal ones); he
speaks compassionately on behalf of
the unborn "infant" and the pregnant
woman who has survived rape, in
which case the "infant" apparently
has no rights. I wonder why he — and
other men — so rarely speak on be
half of men. Aren't "contraceptive
failures" shared? And why do we
hear so little from the men who have
been involved in close calls, or have
accompanied lovers along the rocky

path to the decision about whether to
have an abortion or a baby — don't
those moments of moral decision
making confront a man with hard
questions, too?
There are already a lot of uncared
for infants in the world, and women
only get pregnant when there are men
around: would a legal remedy be a
masculinity tax for the support to
children? About 40 cents on the dol
lar ought to be about right . . . But
somehow men get stuck in the
metaphysico-legal fascinations of
whether at the moment of conception
a fetus or an infant has been initiated,
and whether the woman owns it or
the state. Aw, come on, men!

Nix pricey reviews
I would like to take this opportu
nity to thank The Daily for its excel
lent coverage of the many attractions
of the Napa Valley (May 2). I'm
saving my pennies to try a few of
those quaint $100 hotels and charm
ing $ 140 balloon rides.
Just one question: Did The D.iily
really shell out $140 each for couple
of its ace reporters to take not one
but two balloon rides? If so, it was
wise to run the Napa series after,
rather than prior to, the ASSU fund
ing vote.
How about a switch to reviews of
the best cheap beer and pizza joints?
Stanford's thrift-minded student
body has a reputation to protect.
