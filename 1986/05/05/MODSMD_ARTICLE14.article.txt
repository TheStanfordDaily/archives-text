## Give civil disobedience chance to work 
### 
Despite the assertions of many, civil dis
obedience and political activism have long been an
effective part of the U.S. political and economic
framework. Around the country, college students
— our peers — are putting their money where their
mouths are. calling on their respective universities
to divest from companies doing business with South
Africa, building shanties to symbolize the state of
daily injustice South African blacks live in, sacrific
ing time and energy and risking arrest in anti
apartheid demonstrations on their campuses and in
their capitols. In his most recent column, "Deal
with illegal protests" (Daily, April 28), Jason
Matherly seriously misinterprets and underes
timates the importance of this political activism
among college students.

CHRISTOPHER CELESTE

Not only does Matherly, without explanation,
stereotype protesters as "arrogant lawbreakers"
and "self-righteous vandals . .. grossly overstep
ping the bounds of constructive debate" (real life is
not Forensics 101), he then proceeds to demon
strate a naive intolerance of anything which might
be deemed "not acceptable." He strongly urges
University President Donald Kennedy to remove
"all future eyesores on the Stanford campus,"
neglecting altogether the question of what con
stitutes an eyesore. Perhaps Matherly would like to
see anything that both carries "obnoxious signs"
and is "grass-killing" locked away in some jail cell.
Who draws the line? And where? Is the Gay
Liberation statue an eyesore? What about the
Rodin sculptures? What about the Delta Upsilons?
What about those awful College Republican an
nouncements that litter the tables before meals

once or twice a month? The problem with labeling
something an eyesore is that beauty, and similarly
ugliness, is forever in the eye of the beholder; so
that which is an eyesore to Matherly most probably
becomes a piece of symbolic artwork to Stanford
Out of South Africa.
Matherly, however, was not satisified with simply
invoking stereotypes and leaving relevant questions
unanswered; in fact, these things were only the
icing on his cake. Lines like, "They should have
been told to move or be arrested" exemplified his
position of intolerance and his unwillingness to call
for negotiation and/or compromise between Uni
versity officials and divestiture demonstrators.
Someone should point out to Matherly that this is
not Libya and he is not President Reagan talking to
some punk terrorist. This is a university which, at
its best, has as its primary characteristics a desire
for intellectual enlightenment, respect for the indi
vidual and a healthy dose of open-mindedness (i.e.
tolerance).
The larger mistake Matherly makes, however, is
in assuming that University officials refuse to arrest
protesters in order to accommodate the protesters,
rather than the University itself. If Matherly had a
substantive knowledge of social protest he would
understand that arrests are often exactly the short
term goal student protesters are seeking and Uni
versity officials are trying to avoid. (The obvious
student long-term goal in this case is the divestiture
of University funds, and an even longer-term goal,
the abolishment of apartheid in South Africa).
In fact, Matherly's call for more arrests (more
promptly) would most likely inflame rather than
squelch the divestiture protest within the Univer
sity. Todd Gitlin. a UC-Berkeley sociologist and
himself a student activist during the '60s, speaks of
arrests as both a protest device and a certification

of a newsworthy event. He writes, "Throughout the
sub-society of news reporters, arrests certify protest
events . . . (and are) one of the few mechanisms
available for certifying a social issue." If the Uni
versity went around actively arresting, rather than
attempting to negotiate with, all protesters (in ac
cordance with Matherly's advice) they would not
only help legitimize the protest itself, but most
probably would help increase both its recruitment
and its news coverage.
The fact is civil disobedience is effective. The
continuous jailing of hundreds of blacks during the
'60s in the South, to the point where black child
protesters were arrested and kept in school gym
nasiums, speaks not only to the effectiveness of so
cial protest, but also to its importance. Matherly is
correct in his assertions that some protest activities
are illegal, a fact made clear by the recent sentenc
ing of Stanford student protesters. However,
whether illegal activities like draft card burning,
and lunch counter and divestiture sit-ins are
"wrong" and should be halted is another question
altogether.
Dealing with protesters (as Matherly seems to
imply) by simply saying things like, "What do you
idiots think you're doing" and "Move you and your
i>urhage out of here before I call the police" (the
italics are mine) reflects exactly the kind of in
tolerance and close-mindedness which precipitates
in justice in the first place. Perhaps if people would
stop pretending that the shanties are only campus
eyesores and would start realizing that those
structures represent what some people go home to
sleep in. we as a campus and as a country might be
more willing to help try and make a change in
South Africa.
