# Rioting for a good time
## 
### 
Cloud cover can do peculiar things to those of us who
have adopted (or were born with) a California mindset.
The dearth of solar-dependent activities curtails preoc
cupation with physical sensation and — on occasion —
forces one to think about things. Primarily, of course, one
thinks about the lack of sun. But such thoughts set a dan
gerous precedent; one is apt to begin contemplating
memories of sunnier, warmer days past — spring break
days, for instance. And if one is not careful, one may
begin to think, as I did, of the spring break riot in Palm
Springs.

The infamous Palm Springs riot, you may recall, in
volved some 1,200 college-and-high-school-vacationers
turned-Viking-marauders who tore clothing off female
passersby, terrorized merchants, vandalized property and
battled police with beer bottles and rocks in a four-hour
confrontation which resulted in 80 arrests. For such an
odd incident, the riot made a relatively small splash in the
news. The day after, The Los Angeles Times simply re
ported that a beefed-up Palm Springs police force had
prevented the eruption of further violence, and then
proceeded to almost whimsically detail the rioters' return
to-normal activities like tossing water balloons in the gen
eral vicinity of bikini-clad women. The riot was filed away
and forgotten as a party that went too far, an object of
amusement as much as condemnation.
Yet perhaps the incident was dismissed too quickly.
Despite the apparent youth of the rioters (according to
one witness, most were college freshmen) and (1 hope) the
low representation of Stanford students among them,
these people were in some sense our peers. As a fairly
random sample from a vast number of vacationing stu
dents, they might justifiably be considered representative
of current collegiate America, and the portrait they've
drawn of us ought to prompt a little consideration.
We can, of course, turn immediately to well-established
social psychology explanations for the rioters' behavior.
The concept of the deindividuation phenomenom — in
which certain group situations encourage people who are
otherwise passably civilized to abandon personal respon
sibility and indulge uncivilized, often violent tendencies —
certainly contributes to understanding the extent of the
lawlessness and violence in Palm Springs. But such an ex
planation does not tell the full tale: the Palm Springs
1,200 did not simply blunder on to one another, compare
notes and discover that they shared a secret penchant for
debauchery.
They crowded into the downtown area on a warm
Friday afternoon with the most innocuous of aims: to have
fun. And in that basic desire — or rather, the collegiate
version of that desire — lies the heart of the problem.
Sporadic bursts of political commitment notwithstand
ing, the greater part of college students' extracurricular
energy has long been devoted to the pursuit of the perfect
social interaction. The '60s generation established a stan

durd of social consciousness which the '80s generation, by
and large, fails to meet; but their example was a laudable
aberration. College students have traditionally been less
noble. As far back as 1355, Oxford University students,
ostensibly training for service to the church and crown,
rioted with townspeople after two especially studious
young scholars quarreled with an innkeeper about the
quality of his wine. Even the collegians of the '60s do not
wear their merit badge untarnished; Palm Springs
policemen remarked that the 1986 riot was surpassed in
frenzy only by a similar spring break riot in 1969.
Such outbreaks are of course rare; the tradition is less
of rioting than of rowdiness. A great portion of the college
mystique stems from the belief that it is a social laboratory
in which to explore the limits of that oft-used and gram
matically nonexistent verb, to party. There is nothing in
herently wrong with this belief and the desire to make it
manifest. College is one of the few institutions which en
courages yearning — yearning for knowledge, for intellec
tual perfection, for the tools with which to change oneself
and the world. It encourages these desires by making it
seem possible that they might be fulfilled. It is the percep
tion of those possibilities and the nearly unrestrained pur
suit of their realization that causes people to look back
fondly upon their college years as the best in their lives.
There is no reason why the exploration of hedonistic
possibilities ought not exist alongside the other pursuits,
or even why it should not, on occasion, take precedence
over them. The problem arises when one begins to expect
the fulfillment of one's entire being to the neglect of all
the others. In some ways we are done a disservice by
paeans to college years like "Animal House" or even
"Brideshead Revisited," for they raise expectations which
can rarely be satisfied. Add to this legacy our generation's
superficial sophistication, acquired by early exposure to
sex, alcohol and drugs — things which once constituted
the pinnacle of experience — and it is little wonder that
we should devote more and more energy to more and
more outlandish diversions.
The übiquitous complaints about Stanford social life,
however valid, have in them a kernel of the frustrated
desire that may lead one to, say, toss a burning couch off a
balcony. What can possibly live up to our expectations,
much less top them? Disappointment is guaranteed, and
fun becomes something one has to work at.
Such considerations in no way mitigate the seriousness
of our fellow collegians' action in Palm Springs. Indeed,
the causes of the riot strike me as rather more pathetic
than sad. At the risk of sounding alarmist, it hardly speaks
well of our generation when we have such narrow options
for stimulation that we must turn to violence for gratifica
tion. Our priorities are a bit skewed and in need of rear
rangement when we are willing to riot for a good time.
Fun ultimately depends upon social interaction, and thus
is more dependent upon whom we are with than what we
are doing.
There is unquestionably a great range of unexplored
possibilities in the realm of human relationships. We have
yet to push the limits of getting to know one another, and
it may be worth directing more energy in that direction.
Finding new and imaginative ways to enjoy our college
years is a worthy occupation, but the ancient Greek
maxim applies in this matter as in few others: nothing in
excess.

proceeded to almost whimsically detail the rioters' return
to-normal activities like tossing water balloons in the gen
eral vicinity of bikini-clad women. The riot was filed away
and forgotten as a party that went too far, an object of
amusement as much as condemnation.
Yet perhaps the incident was dismissed too quickly.
Despite the apparent youth of the rioters (according to
one witness, most were college freshmen) and (1 hope) the
low representation of Stanford students among them,
these people were in some sense our peers. As a fairly
random sample from a vast number of vacationing stu
dents, they might justifiably be considered representative
of current collegiate America, and the portrait they've
drawn of us ought to prompt a little consideration.
We can, of course, turn immediately to well-established
social psychology explanations for the rioters' behavior.
The concept of the deindividuation phenomenom — in
which certain group situations encourage people who are
otherwise passably civilized to abandon personal respon
sibility and indulge uncivilized, often violent tendencies —
certainly contributes to understanding the extent of the
lawlessness and violence in Palm Springs. But such an ex
planation does not tell the full tale: the Palm Springs
1,200 did not simply blunder on to one another, compare
notes and discover that they shared a secret penchant for
debauchery.
They crowded into the downtown area on a warm
Friday afternoon with the most innocuous of aims: to have
fun. And in that basic desire — or rather, the collegiate
version of that desire — lies the heart of the problem.
Sporadic bursts of political commitment notwithstand
ing, the greater part of college students' extracurricular
energy has long been devoted to the pursuit of the perfect
social interaction. The '60s generation established a stan

durd of social consciousness which the '80s generation, by
and large, fails to meet; but their example was a laudable
aberration. College students have traditionally been less
noble. As far back as 1355, Oxford University students,
ostensibly training for service to the church and crown,
rioted with townspeople after two especially studious
young scholars quarreled with an innkeeper about the
quality of his wine. Even the collegians of the '60s do not
wear their merit badge untarnished; Palm Springs
policemen remarked that the 1986 riot was surpassed in
frenzy only by a similar spring break riot in 1969.
Such outbreaks are of course rare; the tradition is less
of rioting than of rowdiness. A great portion of the college
mystique stems from the belief that it is a social laboratory
in which to explore the limits of that oft-used and gram
matically nonexistent verb, to party. There is nothing in
herently wrong with this belief and the desire to make it
manifest. College is one of the few institutions which en
courages yearning — yearning for knowledge, for intellec
tual perfection, for the tools with which to change oneself
and the world. It encourages these desires by making it
seem possible that they might be fulfilled. It is the percep
tion of those possibilities and the nearly unrestrained pur
suit of their realization that causes people to look back
fondly upon their college years as the best in their lives.
There is no reason why the exploration of hedonistic
possibilities ought not exist alongside the other pursuits,
or even why it should not, on occasion, take precedence
over them. The problem arises when one begins to expect
the fulfillment of one's entire being to the neglect of all
the others. In some ways we are done a disservice by
paeans to college years like "Animal House" or even
"Brideshead Revisited," for they raise expectations which
can rarely be satisfied. Add to this legacy our generation's
superficial sophistication, acquired by early exposure to
sex, alcohol and drugs — things which once constituted
the pinnacle of experience — and it is little wonder that
we should devote more and more energy to more and
more outlandish diversions.
The übiquitous complaints about Stanford social life,
however valid, have in them a kernel of the frustrated
desire that may lead one to, say, toss a burning couch off a
balcony. What can possibly live up to our expectations,
much less top them? Disappointment is guaranteed, and
fun becomes something one has to work at.
Such considerations in no way mitigate the seriousness
of our fellow collegians' action in Palm Springs. Indeed,
the causes of the riot strike me as rather more pathetic
than sad. At the risk of sounding alarmist, it hardly speaks
well of our generation when we have such narrow options
for stimulation that we must turn to violence for gratifica
tion. Our priorities are a bit skewed and in need of rear
rangement when we are willing to riot for a good time.
Fun ultimately depends upon social interaction, and thus
is more dependent upon whom we are with than what we
are doing.
There is unquestionably a great range of unexplored
possibilities in the realm of human relationships. We have
yet to push the limits of getting to know one another, and
it may be worth directing more energy in that direction.
Finding new and imaginative ways to enjoy our college
years is a worthy occupation, but the ancient Greek
maxim applies in this matter as in few others: nothing in
excess.

Cloud cover can do peculiar things to those of us who
have adopted (or were born with) a California mindset.
The dearth of solar-dependent activities curtails preoc
cupation with physical sensation and — on occasion —
forces one to think about things. Primarily, of course, one
thinks about the lack of sun. But such thoughts set a dan
gerous precedent; one is apt to begin contemplating
memories of sunnier, warmer days past — spring break
days, for instance. And if one is not careful, one may
begin to think, as I did, of the spring break riot in Palm
Springs.

The infamous Palm Springs riot, you may recall, in
volved some 1,200 college-and-high-school-vacationers
turned-Viking-marauders who tore clothing off female
passersby, terrorized merchants, vandalized property and
battled police with beer bottles and rocks in a four-hour
confrontation which resulted in 80 arrests. For such an
odd incident, the riot made a relatively small splash in the
news. The day after, The Los Angeles Times simply re
ported that a beefed-up Palm Springs police force had
prevented the eruption of further violence, and then
proceeded to almost whimsically detail the rioters' return
to-normal activities like tossing water balloons in the gen
eral vicinity of bikini-clad women. The riot was filed away
