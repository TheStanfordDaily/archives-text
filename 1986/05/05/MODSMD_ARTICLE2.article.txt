### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge
Friday handed down a felony conviction and
two reduced sentences for three Stanford stu
dents convicted of using a stolen credit card to
purchase $470 worth of clothing in December.
Judge David Leahy sentenced freshman Sam
Sutherland to three years of probation, $600 in
tines, 200 hours of community service and 30
days in jail for felony forgery, burglary and pos
session of stolen property.
Junior Wendell Brown and Sophomore Ken
Richardson were sentenced to two years of
probation, $300 in fines, 100 hours of commu
nity service and 20 days in jail for misdemeanor
counts of the same offences, according to the
Times Tribune.
The three, all members of the Stanford foot
ball team, had pleaded no contest to in
February.
The jail sentences may be served on a
weekend work program.
Deputy District Attorney Paula Kuty had
asked for felony convictions in all three cases,
but Leahy said Brown and Richardson had ex
emplary pasts that warranted the reductions,
the Tribune reported.
Brown said he and Richardson "didn't have
anything to do with the actual transactions. We
only had the knowledge that they were occur
ring;'
Brown said he is awaiting the outcome of the
Judical Affairs Council investigation before he
makes a decision about continuing at Stanford.
He declined further comment.
Richardson refused to comment, and Suther
land could not be reached.

I he Judicial Affairs Council in January began
investigating the three for violation of the Fun
damental Standard in connection with the
crimes.
Any outcome of those investigations awaits
the compilation of all the facts, according to
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Ron Hudson,
who said that now the trial has been completed,
he expects the council to make a decision
"rather quickly."
While emphasizing that all cases are treated
individually. Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said that in cases "where students have stolen
from other students, the penalties have been
quite severe — including suspension of up to
two years."
The decision will not be announced publicly,
in keeping with council policy, but will be sum
marized in a year-end report without identifying
anyone, she said.
Brown, Sutherland and Richardson were ar
rested Dec. 3 in the Stanford Shopping Center
Emporium-Capwell after attempting to buy
clothes with a credit card stolen from sopho
more teammate David Sweeney.
Sweeney, starting kicker for the football
team, said the card had been missing since Oc
tober.
"It's sad it happened, and they'll pay a heavy
price. It's not just the jail sentences — they've
lost a lot more," Sweeney said. "But the truth
was going to come out, and I'm glad it did."
Other police records show that the three used
a Visa card stolen from junior Dan Brumbaugh
to charge $1,700 in merchandise. Sutherland
also cashed $800 in checks belonging to Brum
baugh, the reports show.
The charges related to this incident
weie not dealt with in the court's
pioceedings, and Brumbaugh said
they have not been dropped.
Brumbaugh s backpack, containing
the credit card and checks, was stolen
trom outside a "very good friend's"
door in Loro house at Florence
Moore Hall. Brumbaugh had left his
backpack there briefly after returning
from Green Library just after mid
night on the morning of Dec. 3.
Sutherland then was a resident in
Loro. He has since moved to Mir
rielees, where Brown and Richardson
live.
Football Head Coach Jack Elway
could not be reached for comment,
but LI way is expected to release a
statement this week, according to
Recruiting Coordinator Dick James.
