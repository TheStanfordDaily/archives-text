People at the California Institute of Tech
nology are weird. They also like acronyms.
Three weeks ago, The Space Weapons
Study Group (SWSG) at Caltech announced
the winners of its "Off-White Paper"
contest. As a protest against what the
SWSG calld the "foolishness of the the huge
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) proposal,"
the group asked students to write parodies of
it. The winners of the contest came up with
some very unusual, acronymaniacal
proposals.
The winner was a proposal entitled
"Application of Genetic Engineering to the
Strategic Defense Initiative" and involves the
use of " a lightweight strain of pygmy hip
popotamus" that would fill with helium after
being fed a special radioactive diet.
These LAUGHS (Lighter than Air Upside
down Grazing HippoS) would then rise to a
height where the "atmospheric density equals
the mean hippo density," or the
"hippopause." They would form a protective
ROOPH (Readily Operative Overhead
Protection by Hippos), thus protecting the
United States from any nuclear attack.
Other notable proposal parodies:
• a Large Attack Zone Yawing System Using
Swivel And Navigation (LAZY SUSAN) be
tween the northern and southern hemi
spheres, which would allow the United States
to rotate 180 degrees in the event of a nuclear
attack:

• a PINNOCHIO proposal (see if you can fig
ure out what all the letters stand for) that sug
gested the installation of "a high-technology,
microprocessor-controlled nasal prosthesis"
(an artificial nose), which would lengthen
when SDI officials lied, "thus alerting legisla
tors and the public";
• a Unified Dirigible Theory (UDT);
• the Use of Caltech Scientists for the
Defense of Ballistic Missiles (UCSDBM); and
• Caltech students: Sending These Unusual
People Into a Dungeon (Caltech students:
STUPID), which is pretty much self
explanatory. No one knows who suggested it.
We are not alone
As part of its year-end issue (yes, year-end
issue), The Michigan Daily prints a "Best of
the Year" list — a compilation of the best res
taurants, movies, stores, concerts, etc. of the
school year.
And the Daily, like some other college
newspapers with the same name, makes a few
mistakes now and then. Witness the follow
ing, reprinted in its entirety, which was under
the heading "Best Daily Foul-Ups, Bleeps
and Blunders":
"The Michigan Daily is the vanguard of
truth, the guardian of accuracy. But
sometimes we mess up. After the space
shuttle Challenger blew up, the Daily ran a
picture of a giant smoky swan on the front
page, trailing smoke as it plummeted to the
sea — sideways.
"Another time, in a story about a speech by
business tycoon T. Boone Pickens, our
reporter described a speaker introducing
Pickens as having a big wad of tobacco in his
mouth. We later learned that it was a birth
defect. Whoops."
Oh well. All we can say is we know how it
feels.
Bill the Cat in Berkeley, Part II
Bill the Cat is alive and well and running for
senator at UC-Berkeley. Again.
A few months ago, you may have read in
this space that a Berkeley student had won a
senate seat in the Berkeley student govern

ment, but that he was encountering some op
position from other senators, who objected to
his assumed name.
Berkeley student Tim Feeley campaigns as
the famous feline, and is up for re-election
later this week, according to the Daily
Californian.
And his campaign tactics are not exactly
agressive, either. All Bill (or Tim) does is
stand in the middle of Sproul Plaza with tape
on his mouth, handing out blank sheets of
paper.
Feeley, who says he is "leader by default"
of Berkeley's "Boring" Party, makes no
promises except that he will "show up" at
ASUC Senate meetings, and warns Berkeley
students not to vote "for the party of death or
you'll turn the campus into a desert of
flames."
And the candidate is expected to win, ac
cording to the Daily Cal. After all, this is
Berkeley we're talking about here.

According to Ron Sendre, a Central Michi
gan University professor of sports medicine,
backpacks may be hazardous to your health.
Backpacks cause "knock-down shoulder"
— a drooping shoulder — swayback, shoulder
tension, headaches and even nerve damage,
Sendre says.
To educate students about the possible
hazards of backpack misuse, Sendre has em
barked upon a "Backpack Use Awareness

Campaign." Most students put too many
things in their backpacks at once, he says.
And though he's "never seen a backpack with
just one strap, that's how most students wear
them."
What's more, Sendre recommends a com
plete workout program for all students in or
der to avoid the dreaded disease. His program
includes weight machines and exercises for
flexibility, and should be on the shelves
alongside Jane Fonda's best-seller in the fall.
Going gaga over Wawas
It was a weekend night at the Wawa Food
Market in New Haven, Conn., and the stu
dents from Yale had a hankering for some
Wawas.
"I would like 14 Wawa dogs with chili and
cheese, please," one said, ordering for his
whole group.
Another Eli said that he eats "between six
and 10 Wawas a week — usually between
2:45 and 5 in the morning.
Indeed, Yalies' taste for Wawas seems to be
dependent on two factors: the time of day and
the physical state of the Eli eating the Wawa.
"I bet Wawa's must sell 10 times as many
Wawas after midnight than they do during the
day," one Yale student claimed, adding that
he'd "gag if I ever tried to eat one sober."
A man who works for Wawa's and who was
identified only as "Vinnie" confirmed that
most Yale students only eat Wawas at night.
"About midnight we throw a whole bunch on
the grill and turn the cooker to 'high,' " he
said.
The Wawa Dog is a nocturnal animal.
More Yale news
More than a year ago, a foursome of Yale
students got together and wrote a book called
"The Complete Book of Drinking Games."
Apparently, the book was less than complete.
A second book, entitled "Beer Games II,"
is now at your local bookstore, and authors
Andy Griscom, Ben Rand, Scott Johnson and
Michael Balay call it their "exploitative se
quel."
But how have they created a sequel to a
supposedly "complete" book? They explain
that the book does indeed contain new contri

butions from readers, in addition to
"prolonging our collective adolescence," as
they write in the book's preface.
However, the book contains more than just
the latest drinking games. In it are ready-to
send postcards urging Miller Lite, David Let
terman and the producers of "Cheers" to put
them on television. It also contains a note ur
ging readers to drop the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee a note requesting that "Beer Pong" be
instated as an Olympic sport.
Other sections of the book include a chap
ter on drinking game etiquette, a beer-lovers
guide to those hard-to-find drinking acces
sories and a drinker's final exam.
There is no mention in the book, however,
about Wawa Dogs.
Equally attractive non-Econ-52-midterm al
ternative:
Bill The Cat is:
A. Playing beer pong at Yale.
B. Eating Wawas at Yale.
C. Playing with his Wawas at Yale.
D. "Ack."
Exercises to combat "backpack back" in
clude:
A. Eating Wawas while standing on your
head.
B. Playing beer pong with your Wawas.
C. This is serious business, see a psychologist.
D. None of the below.
