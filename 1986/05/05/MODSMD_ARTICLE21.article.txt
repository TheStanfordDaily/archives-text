## Pitchers shut down Arizona hitters 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
"Take two and call me in the morn
ing."
That was the prescription for the
Stanford baseball team after
Friday's heartbreaking 2-1 loss in the
first game of a critical three-game
Sunken Diamond homestand against
the Arizona Wildcats.
The Cardinal followed doctor's or
ders and went on to take two from the
Wildcats, finishing the series with a
14-4 thrashing on Saturday and an 8-
3 romp yesterday.
The team now calls in looking
much healthier in the Pac-10 South
ern Division standings than it did
after Friday's game. In third place
and trailing second-place Arizona by
a game after that contest, Stanford
(32-19 overall, 16-11 conference)
stands alone in second after taming
the Wildcats (37-18, 15-12) twice.
League-leading UCLA may have
put a lock on the Six-Pac champion
ship with a three-game sweep of
Arizona State, but a second place
finish would virtually assure the
Cardinal of a postseason berth. In ad
dition, if Arizona should climb back
into a tie with Stanford, this
weekend's action gives the Cardinal a
4-2 edge over the Wildcats on the
season, for tiebreaking purposes.
However, if Stanford continues to
play the way it did this weekend, the
Wildcats will find themselves clawing
thin air in their pursuit of second
place. The Cardinal used excellent
pitching, aggressive hitting and
baserunning, and an airtight defense
to subdue the powerful Wildcats.
"I'm really proud of the team,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"The first game was a heartbreak.

and to come back like they did was
great. We got some real big hits . . .
and (pitching) is where we're tough,
that's the strength of this team."
Yesterday's rubber match bore out
Marquess' assessment. Sophomore
righthander Lee Plemel turned in a
splendid nine-inning effort on the
mound, beguiling the Wildcat batters
with an array of offspeed pitches
while surrendering nine hits and
striking out seven.
Plemel's outing was the third com
plete game of the weekend for the
Cardinal pitching staff, coming on the
heels of nine-inning stints by sopho
more Jack McDowell on Friday and
senior Kevin Kunkel on Saturday.
The win moved Plemel's season
record to five wins and three losses.
"I felt great . . . strong," said
Plemel. "I had a couple bad innings,
though."
Plemel had plenty of offensive sup
port to ease the strain of those bad in
nings. The Cardinal batters unloaded
on Wildcat starter Jason Klonoski in
the first inning to stake Plemel to a 3-
0 lead. Third baseman Ruben Amaro
led off the inning with a hard single,
moved to second on another single by
catcher John Ramos then scored on
Toi Cook's line drive to right.
After Klonoski hit leftfielder Walt
Harris with a pitch, the bases were
loaded for designated hitter Ed
Sprague, who poked a single between
third and short to score Ramos and
Cook. That was all for Klonoski, as
righthander Jim McDonald came on
in relief.
Stanford quickly showed old
Mc Donald that he was on the wrong
Farm. In the third, McDonald
plunked Ramos, surrendered a
double to the sizzling Cook and in

tentionally walked first baseman Ron
Witmeyer. That loaded the bases with
two outs, and shortstop Frank Carey
snuck a clutch single between first
and second to bring in Ramos and
Cook and put Witmeyer on third.
When Carey stole second, Wildcat
catcher Steve Strong's throw went
awry, and Witmeyer scored easily.
After three, the score was 6-1.
Strong atoned for his throwing er
ror with a home run in the fourth.
Gar Millay followed with a sinking
liner to rightfield that bounced past
Cook to the fence. Millay ended up
on third, and scored on'shortstop
Dave Rohde's groundout to second.
That was all the scoring for the
Wildcats, though. They threatened
one more time, putting two on with
one out in the sixth, but Plemel
induced Rohde to ground into a
double play to end the inning and
squelch the rally.
Arizona fans must have felt an
overwhelming sense of deja vu at that
point: it was the second double play
of the game for the Cardinal infield,
and the eighth of the three-game se
ries.
Five of those twin killings came in
Saturday's middle game, repeatedly
stifling Arizona rallies. Cardinal
starter Kunkel treaded lightly
through the Wildcats' minefield of a
batting order, scattering 14 hits and
defusing several potentially explosive
situations by inducing groundouts to
the keystone combination of
shortstop Carey and second baseman
Mark Machtolf.
"I really didn't think I had good
stuff," Kunkel said after the game.
"It's easier to pitch when your of
fense puts a bunch of runs on the

Walt Harris had a rough time at the plate yesterday against Arizona. The Stanford leftfielder fouled a ball off
his left ankle and was twice hit on the right ankle by pitches.

Toi Cook has blossomed after being moved to the fourth spot in the batting order. When he isn't crossing the
plate himself, he is driving teammates in to the tune of a team-leading 43 RBIs.
