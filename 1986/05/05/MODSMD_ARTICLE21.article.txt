## Pitchers shut down Arizona hitters 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
"Take two and call me in the morn
ing."
That was the prescription for the
Stanford baseball team after
Friday's heartbreaking 2-1 loss in the
first game of a critical three-game
Sunken Diamond homestand against
the Arizona Wildcats.
The Cardinal followed doctor's or
ders and went on to take two from the
Wildcats, finishing the series with a
14-4 thrashing on Saturday and an 8-
3 romp yesterday.
The team now calls in looking
much healthier in the Pac-10 South
ern Division standings than it did
after Friday's game. In third place
and trailing second-place Arizona by
a game after that contest, Stanford
(32-19 overall, 16-11 conference)
stands alone in second after taming
the Wildcats (37-18, 15-12) twice.
League-leading UCLA may have
put a lock on the Six-Pac champion
ship with a three-game sweep of
Arizona State, but a second place
finish would virtually assure the
Cardinal of a postseason berth. In ad
dition, if Arizona should climb back
into a tie with Stanford, this
weekend's action gives the Cardinal a
4-2 edge over the Wildcats on the
season, for tiebreaking purposes.
However, if Stanford continues to
play the way it did this weekend, the
Wildcats will find themselves clawing
thin air in their pursuit of second
place. The Cardinal used excellent
pitching, aggressive hitting and
baserunning, and an airtight defense
to subdue the powerful Wildcats.
"I'm really proud of the team,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"The first game was a heartbreak.

and to come back like they did was
great. We got some real big hits . . .
and (pitching) is where we're tough,
that's the strength of this team."
Yesterday's rubber match bore out
Marquess' assessment. Sophomore
righthander Lee Plemel turned in a
splendid nine-inning effort on the
mound, beguiling the Wildcat batters
with an array of offspeed pitches
while surrendering nine hits and
striking out seven.
Plemel's outing was the third com
plete game of the weekend for the
Cardinal pitching staff, coming on the
heels of nine-inning stints by sopho
more Jack McDowell on Friday and
senior Kevin Kunkel on Saturday.
The win moved Plemel's season
record to five wins and three losses.
"I felt great . . . strong," said
Plemel. "I had a couple bad innings,
though."
Plemel had plenty of offensive sup
port to ease the strain of those bad in
nings. The Cardinal batters unloaded
on Wildcat starter Jason Klonoski in
the first inning to stake Plemel to a 3-
0 lead. Third baseman Ruben Amaro
led off the inning with a hard single,
moved to second on another single by
catcher John Ramos then scored on
Toi Cook's line drive to right.
After Klonoski hit leftfielder Walt
Harris with a pitch, the bases were
loaded for designated hitter Ed
Sprague, who poked a single between
third and short to score Ramos and
Cook. That was all for Klonoski, as
righthander Jim McDonald came on
in relief.
Stanford quickly showed old
Mc Donald that he was on the wrong
Farm. In the third, McDonald
plunked Ramos, surrendered a
double to the sizzling Cook and in

tentionally walked first baseman Ron
Witmeyer. That loaded the bases with
two outs, and shortstop Frank Carey
snuck a clutch single between first
and second to bring in Ramos and
Cook and put Witmeyer on third.
When Carey stole second, Wildcat
catcher Steve Strong's throw went
awry, and Witmeyer scored easily.
After three, the score was 6-1.
Strong atoned for his throwing er
ror with a home run in the fourth.
Gar Millay followed with a sinking
liner to rightfield that bounced past
Cook to the fence. Millay ended up
on third, and scored on'shortstop
Dave Rohde's groundout to second.
That was all the scoring for the
Wildcats, though. They threatened
one more time, putting two on with
one out in the sixth, but Plemel
induced Rohde to ground into a
double play to end the inning and
squelch the rally.
Arizona fans must have felt an
overwhelming sense of deja vu at that
point: it was the second double play
of the game for the Cardinal infield,
and the eighth of the three-game se
ries.
Five of those twin killings came in
Saturday's middle game, repeatedly
stifling Arizona rallies. Cardinal
starter Kunkel treaded lightly
through the Wildcats' minefield of a
batting order, scattering 14 hits and
defusing several potentially explosive
situations by inducing groundouts to
the keystone combination of
shortstop Carey and second baseman
Mark Machtolf.
"I really didn't think I had good
stuff," Kunkel said after the game.
"It's easier to pitch when your of
fense puts a bunch of runs on the

plate himself, he is driving teammates in to the tune of a team-leading 43 RBIs.
board. I owe a lot to the defense. We were
really in some tight spots and they turned the
double play."
One of those tight spots came in the third.
Trailing 3-1, the Wildcats had men on first and
second with no outs. Third baseman Chip Hale,
however grounded to Machtolf, who flipped to
Carey to start the double play. That play
loomed especially large when the next Arizona
batter, leftfielder Mike Senne, doubled off the
wall. Only one run came across on that hit, and
that closed the Wildcat scoring until the ninth.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal batters were jump
ing all over Wildcat starter Gary Alexander.
They used an Amaro double, a single by
centerfielder Mark Davis, and a throwing error
by Hale to put three runs on the board in the
first. In the third, Ramos drilled a two-out
double into the leftfield corner and scored on
Cook's shot to the left of Hale.
The Cardinal added another run in the fourth
and went wild again in the sixth. Cook sliced a
double down the rightfield line to lead off that
frame and moved to third on Harris's single.
That set the table for Witmeyer, who cleaned up
with a long triple into the right-center gap. Wit
meyer crossed the plate on Machtolf s grounder
to make the score 8-2 after six.
Arizona threatened again in the seventh,
loading the bases with one out. But Hale
grounded to second to start a double play that
ended the inning. In the bottom of the seventh.

the Cardinal capitalized on two hits, two
Wildcat errors and three walks to chalk up four
more runs and put the ball game on ice.
Friday's game packed considerably more
drama than either of the weekend's subsequent
romps. It was a pitcher's duel between the aces
of both staffs, Stanford's McDowell and
Arizona's Gilbert Heredia, and turned on a
couple gusts of wind on a blustery afternoon.
The Wildcats struck first on an el cheapo
home run by first baseman Todd Trafton. Traf
ton's hit initially looked like no more than a
long fly out to left, but the ball got up in the
wind and snuck over the fence by little more
than a foot.
Heredia, meanwhile, retired the first 12 bat
ters he faced, and didn't face a serious threat
until the sixth. Stanford, trailing 1-0, got a lead
off single from Sprague in that inning. Carey
then walked, and after Machtolf put down a
sacrifice bunt to move both runners up, the
tying and go-ahead runs were in scoring posi
tion with one out.
But Kevin Kunkel, pinch-running for
Sprague, was caught napping and got picked off
third by Heredia. Amaro proceeded to line a
single that would have put Stanford in the lead
had Kunkel not been picked off. Instead, the
Cardinal settled for one run and a 1-1 tie after
six.
The tie didn't last for long. Strong led off the
Wilcat seventh with a single, went to third on
Millay's single and scored on a sacrifice fly by
centerfielder Chuck Johnson to put Arizona on
top 2-1.

double into the leftfield corner and scored on
Cook's shot to the left of Hale.
The Cardinal added another run in the fourth
and went wild again in the sixth. Cook sliced a
double down the rightfield line to lead off that
frame and moved to third on Harris's single.
That set the table for Witmeyer, who cleaned up
with a long triple into the right-center gap. Wit

Arizona threatened again in the seventh,
loading the bases with one out. But Hale

the Cardinal capitalized on two hits, two
Wildcat errors and three walks to chalk up four
more runs and put the ball game on ice.
Friday's game packed considerably more
drama than either of the weekend's subsequent
romps. It was a pitcher's duel between the aces
of both staffs, Stanford's McDowell and
Arizona's Gilbert Heredia, and turned on a
couple gusts of wind on a blustery afternoon.
The Wildcats struck first on an el cheapo
home run by first baseman Todd Trafton. Traf
ton's hit initially looked like no more than a
long fly out to left, but the ball got up in the
wind and snuck over the fence by little more
than a foot.
Heredia, meanwhile, retired the first 12 bat
ters he faced, and didn't face a serious threat
until the sixth. Stanford, trailing 1-0, got a lead
off single from Sprague in that inning. Carey
then walked, and after Machtolf put down a
sacrifice bunt to move both runners up, the
tying and go-ahead runs were in scoring posi
tion with one out.
But Kevin Kunkel, pinch-running for
Sprague, was caught napping and got picked off
third by Heredia. Amaro proceeded to line a
single that would have put Stanford in the lead
had Kunkel not been picked off. Instead, the
Cardinal settled for one run and a 1-1 tie after
six.
The tie didn't last for long. Strong led off the
Wilcat seventh with a single, went to third on
Millay's single and scored on a sacrifice fly by
centerfielder Chuck Johnson to put Arizona on
top 2-1.
"Take two and call me in the morn
ing."
That was the prescription for the
Stanford baseball team after
Friday's heartbreaking 2-1 loss in the
first game of a critical three-game
Sunken Diamond homestand against
the Arizona Wildcats.
The Cardinal followed doctor's or
ders and went on to take two from the
Wildcats, finishing the series with a
14-4 thrashing on Saturday and an 8-
3 romp yesterday.
The team now calls in looking
much healthier in the Pac-10 South
ern Division standings than it did
after Friday's game. In third place
and trailing second-place Arizona by
a game after that contest, Stanford
(32-19 overall, 16-11 conference)
stands alone in second after taming
the Wildcats (37-18, 15-12) twice.
League-leading UCLA may have
put a lock on the Six-Pac champion
ship with a three-game sweep of
Arizona State, but a second place
finish would virtually assure the
Cardinal of a postseason berth. In ad
dition, if Arizona should climb back
into a tie with Stanford, this
weekend's action gives the Cardinal a
4-2 edge over the Wildcats on the
season, for tiebreaking purposes.
However, if Stanford continues to
play the way it did this weekend, the
Wildcats will find themselves clawing
thin air in their pursuit of second
place. The Cardinal used excellent
pitching, aggressive hitting and
baserunning, and an airtight defense
to subdue the powerful Wildcats.
"I'm really proud of the team,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said.
"The first game was a heartbreak.

and to come back like they did was
great. We got some real big hits . . .
and (pitching) is where we're tough,
that's the strength of this team."
Yesterday's rubber match bore out
Marquess' assessment. Sophomore
righthander Lee Plemel turned in a
splendid nine-inning effort on the
mound, beguiling the Wildcat batters
with an array of offspeed pitches
while surrendering nine hits and
striking out seven.
Plemel's outing was the third com
plete game of the weekend for the
Cardinal pitching staff, coming on the
heels of nine-inning stints by sopho
more Jack McDowell on Friday and
senior Kevin Kunkel on Saturday.
The win moved Plemel's season
record to five wins and three losses.
"I felt great . . . strong," said
Plemel. "I had a couple bad innings,
though."
Plemel had plenty of offensive sup
port to ease the strain of those bad in
nings. The Cardinal batters unloaded
on Wildcat starter Jason Klonoski in
the first inning to stake Plemel to a 3-
0 lead. Third baseman Ruben Amaro
led off the inning with a hard single,
moved to second on another single by
catcher John Ramos then scored on
Toi Cook's line drive to right.
After Klonoski hit leftfielder Walt
Harris with a pitch, the bases were
loaded for designated hitter Ed
Sprague, who poked a single between
third and short to score Ramos and
Cook. That was all for Klonoski, as
righthander Jim McDonald came on
in relief.
Stanford quickly showed old
Mc Donald that he was on the wrong
Farm. In the third, McDonald
plunked Ramos, surrendered a
double to the sizzling Cook and in

tentionally walked first baseman Ron
Witmeyer. That loaded the bases with
two outs, and shortstop Frank Carey
snuck a clutch single between first
and second to bring in Ramos and
Cook and put Witmeyer on third.
When Carey stole second, Wildcat
catcher Steve Strong's throw went
awry, and Witmeyer scored easily.
After three, the score was 6-1.
Strong atoned for his throwing er
ror with a home run in the fourth.
Gar Millay followed with a sinking
liner to rightfield that bounced past
Cook to the fence. Millay ended up
on third, and scored on'shortstop
Dave Rohde's groundout to second.
That was all the scoring for the
Wildcats, though. They threatened
one more time, putting two on with
one out in the sixth, but Plemel
induced Rohde to ground into a
double play to end the inning and
squelch the rally.
Arizona fans must have felt an
overwhelming sense of deja vu at that
point: it was the second double play
of the game for the Cardinal infield,
and the eighth of the three-game se
ries.
Five of those twin killings came in
Saturday's middle game, repeatedly
stifling Arizona rallies. Cardinal
starter Kunkel treaded lightly
through the Wildcats' minefield of a
batting order, scattering 14 hits and
defusing several potentially explosive
situations by inducing groundouts to
the keystone combination of
shortstop Carey and second baseman
Mark Machtolf.
"I really didn't think I had good
stuff," Kunkel said after the game.

double play."
One of those tight spots came in the third.
Trailing 3-1, the Wildcats had men on first and
second with no outs. Third baseman Chip Hale,
however grounded to Machtolf, who flipped to
Carey to start the double play. That play
loomed especially large when the next Arizona
batter, leftfielder Mike Senne, doubled off the
wall. Only one run came across on that hit, and
that closed the Wildcat scoring until the ninth.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal batters were jump
ing all over Wildcat starter Gary Alexander.
They used an Amaro double, a single by
centerfielder Mark Davis, and a throwing error
by Hale to put three runs on the board in the
first. In the third, Ramos drilled a two-out
double into the leftfield corner and scored on
Cook's shot to the left of Hale.

Dave Rohde's groundout to second.
That was all the scoring for the
Wildcats, though. They threatened
one more time, putting two on with

induced Rohde to ground into a
double play to end the inning and
squelch the rally.
Arizona fans must have felt an
overwhelming sense of deja vu at that
point: it was the second double play
of the game for the Cardinal infield,
and the eighth of the three-game se
ries.
Five of those twin killings came in
Saturday's middle game, repeatedly
stifling Arizona rallies. Cardinal
starter Kunkel treaded lightly
through the Wildcats' minefield of a
batting order, scattering 14 hits and
defusing several potentially explosive
situations by inducing groundouts to
the keystone combination of
shortstop Carey and second baseman
Mark Machtolf.
"I really didn't think I had good
stuff," Kunkel said after the game.

Walt Harris had a rough time at the plate yesterday against Arizona. The Stanford leftfielder fouled a ball off
his left ankle and was twice hit on the right ankle by pitches.

Toi Cook has blossomed after being moved to the fourth spot in the batting order. When he isn't crossing the
plate himself, he is driving teammates in to the tune of a team-leading 43 RBIs.
board. I owe a lot to the defense. We were
really in some tight spots and they turned the
double play."
One of those tight spots came in the third.
Trailing 3-1, the Wildcats had men on first and
second with no outs. Third baseman Chip Hale,
however grounded to Machtolf, who flipped to
Carey to start the double play. That play
loomed especially large when the next Arizona
batter, leftfielder Mike Senne, doubled off the
wall. Only one run came across on that hit, and
that closed the Wildcat scoring until the ninth.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal batters were jump
ing all over Wildcat starter Gary Alexander.
They used an Amaro double, a single by
centerfielder Mark Davis, and a throwing error
by Hale to put three runs on the board in the
first. In the third, Ramos drilled a two-out
double into the leftfield corner and scored on
Cook's shot to the left of Hale.
The Cardinal added another run in the fourth
and went wild again in the sixth. Cook sliced a
double down the rightfield line to lead off that
frame and moved to third on Harris's single.
That set the table for Witmeyer, who cleaned up
with a long triple into the right-center gap. Wit
meyer crossed the plate on Machtolf s grounder
to make the score 8-2 after six.
Arizona threatened again in the seventh,
loading the bases with one out. But Hale
grounded to second to start a double play that
ended the inning. In the bottom of the seventh.

the Cardinal capitalized on two hits, two
Wildcat errors and three walks to chalk up four
more runs and put the ball game on ice.
Friday's game packed considerably more
drama than either of the weekend's subsequent
romps. It was a pitcher's duel between the aces
of both staffs, Stanford's McDowell and
Arizona's Gilbert Heredia, and turned on a
couple gusts of wind on a blustery afternoon.
The Wildcats struck first on an el cheapo
home run by first baseman Todd Trafton. Traf
ton's hit initially looked like no more than a
long fly out to left, but the ball got up in the
wind and snuck over the fence by little more
than a foot.
Heredia, meanwhile, retired the first 12 bat
ters he faced, and didn't face a serious threat
until the sixth. Stanford, trailing 1-0, got a lead
off single from Sprague in that inning. Carey
then walked, and after Machtolf put down a
sacrifice bunt to move both runners up, the
tying and go-ahead runs were in scoring posi
tion with one out.
But Kevin Kunkel, pinch-running for
Sprague, was caught napping and got picked off
third by Heredia. Amaro proceeded to line a
single that would have put Stanford in the lead
had Kunkel not been picked off. Instead, the
Cardinal settled for one run and a 1-1 tie after
six.
The tie didn't last for long. Strong led off the
Wilcat seventh with a single, went to third on
Millay's single and scored on a sacrifice fly by
centerfielder Chuck Johnson to put Arizona on
top 2-1.
