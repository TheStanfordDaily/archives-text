# Stanford destroyed by Bears
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
This years Big Meet turned into a
Big Win for UC-Berkeley and a Big
Disappointment for Stanford.
Saturday at Berkeley's Edwards
Stadium, a talented California squad
had little problem running by the
Cardinal. Both the Stanford men's
and the women's teams were soundly
beaten by the Bears.
For the men it was the team's 15th
straight Pacific 10 Conference loss to
Cal. And if that fact wasn't enough,
the score of 112-44 was the second
worst of all time for the Cardinal.
The Bears swept the 100-meters,
200, long jump, javelin and shot, and
grabbed first and second in the high
hurdles and the 400. Stanford's few
victories came from the distance run
ners.
Ryan Stoll won the 3,000
steeplechase: Christian Skoog took
the 800; and Charles Alexander
grabbed first in the 5,000. In the
men's 1,500, an anticipated duel be-

termed a M fun" match in Maples Pavilion.
tween Cal's and Stanford's top dis
tance men was postponed, as the
Bear's Jay Marden decided to sit out
the meet. With Marden missing, the
Cardinal's Jeff Atkinson had little
trouble winning the race with a
routine time of 4:01.15.
Together the harriers scored 22
points, but in the end it wasn't nearly
enough. Twenty-two points
amounted to half of the Cardinal's
total score.
In the women's meet Stanford
didn't fare much better. A three-year
Cardinal winning streak was snapped,
as the Bears beat Stanford by a count
of 97-48.
Like the men's meet it was the
sprints and jumps which killed the
Cardinal's chances. Cal swept the 200
and placed first and second in the
long jump, the 100 hurdles, the 400,
the triple jump and the 100.
Senior thrower Pam Dukes claimed
two of Stanford's combined nine vic
tories with wins in the shotput and the

discus. Her discus throw of 180-8 was
a personal best by four feet. Dukes
was followed by her freshman
teammate Patty Purpur, who placed
second with a toss of 173-3, a mark
which qualified her for the NCA As.
Also qualifying for the NCA As was
senior Alison Wiley who won the
5,000 with a time of 16:04. The time
was significantly off her best, but for
Wiley who has been battling ten
donitis all season, the victory was a
much needed lift.
"It was only my second track race
of the year, so I didn't really know
what to expect," Wiley said. "1 talked
to Brooks (Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson), and he said just to go out
and see what happens."
"It (the win) definitely helps. Now
I don't have to worry about times. I
can just go on training and not have
to worry about qualifying," she
added.
• With the victory, the Cal men's
team moved its advantage in the Big
Meet series to 49-41-2. The Stanford
women are still holding on to a slight
advantage; they lead the series 4-3.
The Big Meet marked the end of
the Cardinal's dual meet season.
