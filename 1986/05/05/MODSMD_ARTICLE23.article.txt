# Cook produces for Card
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
It happened with one out in the bottom of the eighth in
ning during yesterday's baseball game between Stanford
and Arizona.
The play wasn't a strange one: with runners on second
and third, Toi Cook hit a bouncer to the right side of
Arizona's infield. Todd Trafton, the Wildcats' first
baseman, fielded the ball on two hops and threw to the
'plate to beat Ken Green, who broke from third with the
contact, by 10 feet.
Routine enough.
It wasn't even a very important play: Stanford was well
in command at that point, up 8-3.
What, then, was so noteworthy?
Well, Cook, Stanford's improbable cleanup hitter,
failed to come up with a big hit, for once. He didn't even
get the runner in from third.
"I blew it, I was really anxious up there that time,"
Stanford's rightfielder said afterward.
It's not that Cook, a junior from Canoga Park, is hard
on himself. He just hasn't had much of anything to fret
about lately.
Take yesterday. Cook inflicted damage on Arizona's
pitching staff well before the eighth-inning groundout. He
lined a single to right in the first inning to score Ruben
Amaro with Stanford's first run; in the third he doubled
and later scored; and in the fourth, Cook lofted a sacrifice
fly to right that plated Mark Davis from third.
Not a bad day's work: three hits in four trips to the
plate, two RBIs and two runs scored. But, it was an encore
— on Saturday, Cook went 4-for-5, scored twice and
drove in two more runs in Stanford's 14-4 win.
It's the sort of weekend that's become expected of
Cook since Stanford Coach Mark Marquess moved him to
the fourth spot in the batting order three weeks ago. Cook
has responded by knocking in 19 runs in 16 games. His
batting average is up from the . 280's to .327.
" He's been a clutch performer for us," Marquess said of
Cook, who leads the team with 43 RBIs. "He's driven in a
lot of big runs."

Who would have thought that Cook, with three home
runs in 461 career at-bats with the Cardinal (one this year
in 214 trips to the plate), would ever check in at the
cleanup spot? After all, powerful Rick Lundblade, he of
the 25 dingers, resided there last year.
"For our style of play, he's a good No. 4 hitter," said
Marquess, whose team has hit only 23 home runs.
Cook, who has batted anywhere and everywhere in the
Cardinal lineup this year, has prospered with the change.
"It's really a confidence thing with me," he said. "I knew
the reason they put me there — I have kind of a knack for
hitting with runners on base. It (batting cleanup) accen
tuates my ability."
Before his recent flurry, it seemed Cook was in the
lineup only for his speed (he has stolen 31 bases in 34
tries) and fielding prowess. Indeed, Marquess says that
he'll move the fleet-footed and strong-armed Cook to
centerfield next year after Davis' graduation.
"He'll be a great centerfielder," Marquess said. "He
can go and get it almost as well as Mark."
Cook, who admitted to being tight and anxious in the
early season, got only six hits in his first 32 plate appear
ances this year. Then things started to come together and
his average has been on the move since.
"I moved off the plate a little bit," Cook explained.
"It's really important for me to get my arms extended, and
I told myself I wasn't going to swing at anything but
fastballs.
"I'm trying to concentrate on hitting my pitches, not the
pitcher's pitches."
For Cook, who doubles as the starting left cornerback
on Stanford's football team, decision time is fast ap
proaching.
Faced with a pleasant little dilemma — whether to
pursue baseball or football — he has adopted a "let the
cookie crumble as it may" attitude.
"I've always wanted to try the pros," Cook says. "I'll go
with whichever sport I think I have the best chance to
make it — as of now, I consider myself an above-average
player, but not a superstar."
Not many thought of him as a cleanup hitter, either.
Things can change in a hurry.
