# Netters easily win in Maples matchup
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Last night, in Maples Pavilion,
Stanford defeated California in the
sixth annual indoor mixed match be
tween the two teams. The contest,
scored in the World Team Tennis for
mat, also mixed great tennis with fun.
The Cardinal, which had won each
of the previous mixed matches as
well, defeated the Bears easily, 34-
23, winning four of the individual
matches. The evening was highlighted
by the women's singles and the men's
doubles, both of which were won by
California.
The women's singles had Stanford
freshman Marianne Werdel facing off
against Heather Ettus. Werdel
started off strong, repeatedly hitting
clean winners from the baseline.
However, hitting clean winners from
the baseline is not quite the most
relaxing way to win a tennis match,
and after taking a 3-0 lead, Werdel
started to tire, losing five straight
before taking her serve to put the
match at 5-4.
Ettus, also a baseliner, proved too
consistent, especially in contrast to
Werdel's erratic play, and held her
serve to take the match.
In the next match, the fifth of the
night, the No. 1 Cardinal doubles pair

of Jim Grabb and Dan Goldie took
the court with Peter Wright and Don
Leone for a quick match of service
winners and overheads. Everybody
held serve through the first 12 games,
setting up a tie breaker, which the
Bears won 7-4.
Goldie wasn't too concerned with
the loss. "You always want to win,
but it's just for fun," he said. "We
were a little bit sluggish."
"Just for fun," was the theme of
the event. "It's a fun chance for the
two teams to mix," Stanford sopho
more Kay Tittle said.
"We want to win for sure, but it's
more for enjoyment," Tittle's
doubles partner John Letts said. "We
don't often get a chance to play with
the girls."
Tittle and Letts closed out the four
hour evening with a relaxed 6-0 win
over Cat's Sharon Fletcher and Steve
DeVries. "I think they were tired,"
Cal Coach Bill Wright said half
seriously of Fletcher and DeVries.
"It's late, they should be sleeping, let
alone playing tennis."
Opening up the play was a mixed
doubles match between Stanford's
Eric Rosenfeld and Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Cal's Woody Hunt and
Jennifer Prah. Rosenfeld and
Eldredge, whose intensity could be
measured by the fact that the two
were smiling for just about the entire
time, disposed of their lackluster op
ponents smoothly by a deceiving 6-4
score.
In men's singles, Cardinal sopho
more Patrick McEnroe avenged a
recent loss to Harold Hecht by
trouncing him 6-2 with his usual
barrage of double-fisted backhand
winners.
