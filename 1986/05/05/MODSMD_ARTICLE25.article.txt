# Cardinal ekes out win in Berkeley

### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Baseball may be called a game of
inches, but that epithet would prob
ably be more appropriate for the
game of tennis.
Proof was nowhere more present
than in Friday afternoon's match in
Berkeley between the sixth-ranked
Stanford Cardinal and the eighth
ranked California Golden Bears.
With No. I doubles the*only match
left on the court, the Cardinal and
Bears had already won four individ
ual matches apiece. The Cal duo of

Peter Wright and Don Leone held a
match point in the second set tie
breaker against the Stanford pair of
Dan Goldie and Jim Grabb.
Goldie served to Wright at 6-7, and
Wright shanked the ball up into the
air. It sailed over the heads of both
Goldie and Grabb, who helplessly
watched as it bounced just out of the
court. Inches out.
With that reprieve, Goldie and
Grabb charged back to take the tie
breaker and then the final set to
propel the Cardinal to a 5-4 victory in

the last regular season match for
Stanford.
The victory almost assured the
Cardinal squad a berth in the NCAA
tournament which begins May 17 in
Athens, Ga. If the rankings stay the
same as they are now, Stanford pos
sibly will be seeded fifth or sixth in
the tourney.
The outcome left California's
postseason hopes uncertain. With
UCLA, USC and, possibly, Pep
perdine almost assured of bids, the
Bears will have to hope that the
NCAA takes five teams from Califor
nia.
The Cal squad knew how crucial
the match was and the players per
formed accordingly.
After singles play the match was
tied at 3-3, but the score easily could
have been 4-2 for either team. In the
No. 1 singles match, Cal's Steve
DeVries had a match point on Goldie
in the second set, but the Stanford
senior then turned on the jets and
breezed to victory 3-6, 7-6, 6-1.
Likewise for Stanford, Cardinal
John Letts had a match point against
Cal's Woody Hunt in the second set
of the No. 5 singles match. But Hunt
rallied to take the second set 7-5 and
went on to win 2-6, 7-5, 6-4.
"The momentum passed back and
forth all day," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "I think special credit has
to go to Dan. He had a case of the flu
on Thursday and didn't practice, then
he turned in a tremendously big per
formance under less than ideal condi
tions."
Those less than ideal conditions
were rain delays. Showers interrupted
the No. 1 doubles match midway
through the second set and early in
the third set. In fact, the match didn't
end until after 7 p.m.
The win for Stanford was the
team's second in a row (the Cardinal

Dan Goldie came back from a match point to down California's Steve DeVries in a
pressure-packed match with the Bears and provided the margin of victory for Stanford in
a 5-4 thriller.
