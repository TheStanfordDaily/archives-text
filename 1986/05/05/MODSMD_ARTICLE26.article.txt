# Softball drops two twinbills

The Grand Canyon State literally and com
petitively terrorized the Stanford softball team this
weekend, as the women fell to Arizona and Arizona
State and saw their airplane grounded for three
hours by a bomb threat.
The Cardinal squad's troubles began Friday as it
met No. 3 ranked Arizona State and lost 6-1 and 9-
0 in the evening doubleheader. Betsy Watson
pitched the first game and relieved Lisa Buchanan
in the second.
"ASU is ranked third in the nation, and we lost
big," Buchanan said. "They just hit the ball. They
are excellent, well-trained and disciplined hitters
who hit the ball where they want."
Saturday did not treat the Cardinal any better as
the team lost to Arizona 5-0 and 6-0. Hitting
remained the deciding factor.
"Everyone played well, but they hit our pitch
ing," Buchanan said. "We're disappointed with our
scores, but we played our hardest."
Despite the lack of success on its trip, the team is
not disconsolate. "We just don't have scholarships
to get good pitchers," Buchanan explained. "When
they beat us with 11 scholarships, it's logical. As
soon as we get one scholarship, or two or four, we'll
do better."
More disconcerting to the Stanford women was
the bomb threat on their flight back. All of the pas
sengers were taken off the plane and moved to a
holding area for three hours. Finally, after all of the
luggage was X-rayed and sniffed by trained sentry
dogs, the team boarded another plane and headed
home.
It was an awakening experience, giving the
women "something more important to think about
than softball," Buchanan said.
The Cardinal women will look to recover from
the experience and get softball back on their minds
for Tuesday afternoon's match-up with California.
The Stanford squad will be looking for an upset.
Whatever the outcome, there will be a spirited
performance. "We go out there to play our hard
est," Buchanan said, "and also try to have a good
time."
