### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Westwood almost became a burial
ground for the Stanford women's ten
nis team's hopes of entering this
month's NCAA championships as the
top seed, but Leigh Anne Eldredge,
Patty Fendick and Stephanie Savides
fought off an improved UCLA team
as the Cardinal edged the Bruins 5-4
on Friday in the squad's last dual
match of the season.
On Feb. 28, Stanford rolled past
visiting UCLA 8-1. Friday, however,
the No. 2 Cardinal had to rely on its
trio of experienced juniors to eke out
a victory over the No. 7 Bruins.
"I was sweating bullets there for a
while," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said. "They really had a good
lineup for us."
Fendick, who last weekend
captured the Women's Intercollegiate
Singles title at the Ojai Intercol
legiate, continued to play im
pressively in preparation for the na
tionals. Friday, she beat UCLA's
Jane Thomas 6-3, 6-2 in the No. 1
singles match to up her dual match
record to 10-5.
"Patty played a good, solid match,"

Brennan said.
Savides was equally as dominant in
the No. 4 singles match, beating
UCLA's Patricia Hy 6-4, 6-1. The
victory raised her record to 14-3. Her
14 wins lead the Cardinal this season.
"Stephanie just killed her," Bren
nan said.
While Fendick and Savides were
making short work of their oppo
nents, UCLA was looking strong in
the rest of the singles matches. The
Bruins took the first set in the other
four matches.
"We hadn't played a dual match in
a while," Brennan said. "We were a
little shaky at the beginning."
After trailing almost the entire
match, Eldredge found a way to beat
UCLA's Joni Urban 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in
the No. 3 singles. She had to come
from behind in nearly every game in
the third set to pull out the victory.
"Eldredge had the really key
match," Brennan said. "She was al
ways nip and tuck. She was down 1-3
in several games (in the third set), but
she was tough."
