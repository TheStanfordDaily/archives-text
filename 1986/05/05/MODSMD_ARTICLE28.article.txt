# UCLA gives women scare in L.A., 5-4
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
Westwood almost became a burial
ground for the Stanford women's ten
nis team's hopes of entering this
month's NCAA championships as the
top seed, but Leigh Anne Eldredge,
Patty Fendick and Stephanie Savides
fought off an improved UCLA team
as the Cardinal edged the Bruins 5-4
on Friday in the squad's last dual
match of the season.
On Feb. 28, Stanford rolled past
visiting UCLA 8-1. Friday, however,
the No. 2 Cardinal had to rely on its
trio of experienced juniors to eke out
a victory over the No. 7 Bruins.
"I was sweating bullets there for a
while," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said. "They really had a good
lineup for us."
Fendick, who last weekend
captured the Women's Intercollegiate
Singles title at the Ojai Intercol
legiate, continued to play im
pressively in preparation for the na
tionals. Friday, she beat UCLA's
Jane Thomas 6-3, 6-2 in the No. 1
singles match to up her dual match
record to 10-5.
"Patty played a good, solid match,"

Brennan said.
Savides was equally as dominant in
the No. 4 singles match, beating
UCLA's Patricia Hy 6-4, 6-1. The
victory raised her record to 14-3. Her
14 wins lead the Cardinal this season.
"Stephanie just killed her," Bren
nan said.
While Fendick and Savides were
making short work of their oppo
nents, UCLA was looking strong in
the rest of the singles matches. The
Bruins took the first set in the other
four matches.
"We hadn't played a dual match in
a while," Brennan said. "We were a
little shaky at the beginning."
After trailing almost the entire
match, Eldredge found a way to beat
UCLA's Joni Urban 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in
the No. 3 singles. She had to come
from behind in nearly every game in
the third set to pull out the victory.
"Eldredge had the really key
match," Brennan said. "She was al
ways nip and tuck. She was down 1-3
in several games (in the third set), but
she was tough."
Sophomores Cari Hagey and Kay
Tittle, and freshman Marianne Wer
del could not manufacture similar
comebacks.
Werdel, who played almost perfect
tennis in winning the Women's Invi
tational College Singles champion
ship at Ojai last weekend, was beaten
by Jennifer Fuchs. The UCLA fresh
man won 6-3, 7-5.
"Marianne played well, but Fuchs
played really well," Brennan said.
"She (Werdel) got stronger instead of
weaker. She was a point away from
the second set. I think if she would
have won that, she would have won
the match."
Friday's match marked the
relatively unspectacular return of
Tittle to the Cardinal lineup. After
missing the last two weeks due to ill
ness, she was not on top of her game
against the Bruins' Allyson Cooper
and suffered only her third loss of the
season, 6-3, 6-1.
"Kay has not played in a while so
she was having her problems," Bren
nan said. "Give her a week and she
kills Cooper."
Hagey was done in by an old

Nemesis — UCLA's Catherine
O'Meara. For the third time in three
matches, O'Meara had Hagey's num
ber, this time 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
With the match knotted at 3-3, the
Cardinal had to play pressure doubles
for the Cirst time since the USC match
on April 19.
"We should have swept the
doubles," Brennan said.
Stanford did not sweep, but it did
win two of the three doubles matches
to clinch the team victory.
Fendick and Eldredge, ranked
sixth nationally, won in straight sets
over Thomas and Hy 7-5, 6-3 in the
No. 1 match.
Savides and Hagey moved to 12-1
on the season with a victory over
Fuchs and Maria La Franchi. The
Cardinal pair. No. 10 in the most
recent rankings, won 6-4, 6-2.
With the team score 5-3, Werdel
and Tittle had a match point in the
second set of the No. 3 doubles but
lost 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 to Cooper and
Colinne Bartel.
The new national rankings were
released earlier last week, and the
Cardinal found itself occupying the
No. 2 position again, despite the
Anril 19 victorv over No. 1 USC.

Friday's match marked the
relatively unspectacular return of
Tittle to the Cardinal lineup. After
missing the last two weeks due to ill
ness, she was not on top of her game
against the Bruins' Allyson Cooper
and suffered only her third loss of the
season, 6-3, 6-1.
"Kay has not played in a while so
she was having her problems," Bren
nan said. "Give her a week and she
kills Cooper."
Hagey was done in by an old

Nemesis — UCLA's Catherine
O'Meara. For the third time in three
matches, O'Meara had Hagey's num
ber, this time 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
With the match knotted at 3-3, the
Cardinal had to play pressure doubles
for the Cirst time since the USC match
on April 19.
"We should have swept the
doubles," Brennan said.
Stanford did not sweep, but it did
win two of the three doubles matches
to clinch the team victory.
Fendick and Eldredge, ranked
sixth nationally, won in straight sets
over Thomas and Hy 7-5, 6-3 in the
No. 1 match.
Savides and Hagey moved to 12-1
on the season with a victory over
Fuchs and Maria La Franchi. The
Cardinal pair. No. 10 in the most
recent rankings, won 6-4, 6-2.
With the team score 5-3, Werdel
and Tittle had a match point in the
second set of the No. 3 doubles but
lost 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 to Cooper and
Colinne Bartel.
The new national rankings were
released earlier last week, and the
Cardinal found itself occupying the
No. 2 position again, despite the
Anril 19 victorv over No. 1 USC.
Westwood almost became a burial
ground for the Stanford women's ten
nis team's hopes of entering this
month's NCAA championships as the
top seed, but Leigh Anne Eldredge,
Patty Fendick and Stephanie Savides
fought off an improved UCLA team
as the Cardinal edged the Bruins 5-4
on Friday in the squad's last dual
match of the season.
On Feb. 28, Stanford rolled past
visiting UCLA 8-1. Friday, however,
the No. 2 Cardinal had to rely on its
trio of experienced juniors to eke out
a victory over the No. 7 Bruins.
"I was sweating bullets there for a
while," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said. "They really had a good
lineup for us."
Fendick, who last weekend
captured the Women's Intercollegiate
Singles title at the Ojai Intercol
legiate, continued to play im
pressively in preparation for the na
tionals. Friday, she beat UCLA's
Jane Thomas 6-3, 6-2 in the No. 1
singles match to up her dual match
record to 10-5.
"Patty played a good, solid match,"

Brennan said.
Savides was equally as dominant in
the No. 4 singles match, beating
UCLA's Patricia Hy 6-4, 6-1. The
victory raised her record to 14-3. Her
14 wins lead the Cardinal this season.
"Stephanie just killed her," Bren
nan said.
While Fendick and Savides were
making short work of their oppo
nents, UCLA was looking strong in
the rest of the singles matches. The
Bruins took the first set in the other
four matches.
"We hadn't played a dual match in
a while," Brennan said. "We were a
little shaky at the beginning."
After trailing almost the entire
match, Eldredge found a way to beat
UCLA's Joni Urban 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in
the No. 3 singles. She had to come
from behind in nearly every game in
the third set to pull out the victory.
"Eldredge had the really key
match," Brennan said. "She was al
ways nip and tuck. She was down 1-3
in several games (in the third set), but
she was tough."
Sophomores Cari Hagey and Kay
Tittle, and freshman Marianne Wer
del could not manufacture similar
comebacks.
Werdel, who played almost perfect
tennis in winning the Women's Invi
tational College Singles champion
ship at Ojai last weekend, was beaten
by Jennifer Fuchs. The UCLA fresh
man won 6-3, 7-5.
"Marianne played well, but Fuchs
played really well," Brennan said.
"She (Werdel) got stronger instead of
weaker. She was a point away from
the second set. I think if she would
have won that, she would have won
the match."
