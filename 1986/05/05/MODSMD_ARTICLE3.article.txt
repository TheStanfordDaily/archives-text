# Local women escape Kiev unhurt

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Three local women who were in Kiev last week
during the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant were tested for radiation at Stanford Hospital
Friday and given a clean bill of health.
Dr. Roland Finston, a radiologist at the Medical
Center, said although minor traces of radioactive
iodine-13 1 were found in two women's thyroid
glands and in the soles of one's shoes, they are in no
danger.

The amount of radiation to which the women
were exposed was about equal to the dose an
average American receives every two weeks
through natural sources such as sunlight, food and
natural material in the ground, according to
Finston, the director of health physics here.
Doctors tested for but found no traces of any
other radioactive elements that could have emitted
from the accident site, about 60 miles north of Kiev
in the Soviet Ukraine.
The results of the tests indicate that if any of the
fallout from the accident reaches the United States,
it will pose no health risk. Finston said.
The test results are highly dependable because

radioactivity is easily detectable with modern
equipment, according to Finston. "People can have
very small quantities of such materials in their
bodies, and we'll know it's there," he said.
None of the women was prescribed drugs or in
structed to take any precautions, and the iodine in
their thyroids should disappear within the coming
weeks, he said.
The women — Canda Kinney, 37, of Redding;
Jan Wilson, 38, of Oakland; and Lucille Rose, 71,
of San Jose — were the first people tested at Stan
ford for radiation resulting from exposure to a nu
clear accident.
Kinney and Wilson were given tests to detect
iodine in the thyroid, and one was then given a
"whole-body counter," a screening of the entire
body to detect radiation. Since nothing was de
tected, doctors decided not to test the others be
cause they had been exposed to the same or lower
levels of radiation while in the Soviet Union,
Finston said.
Each received about three millirads of radiation,
, and none felt any effects of the exposure, he said.
Finston said he is worried by actions some
Americans have taken to prepare themselves for
radiation if and when it reaches this country.
The side effects of taking iodine medication to
combat the effects of the radioactive form of the
element far outweigh the danger presented by

wind-blown fallout, he said. The decision to use
medication that was recently distributed to children
in Poland "should be a decision based on environ
mental measurements (of radiation levels)," which
currently indicate there will be no danger.
Frnston sufd if there any trazard in the United
States when the debris reaches this country, it will
likely come from iodine contamination in food,
particularly the milk supply, since cows graze on
grass where radioactive material can settle.
Finston said he has received several calls recently
from local residents concerned about the effects of
the radiation.
The accident resulted in "unprecedented con
tamination," according to Finston, but he stressed
that no accurate predictions of the consequences
for the United States or Europe can be made until
reliable data from rainwater analysis and other
sources are available.
The most serious concern should be for the
people closest to the accident in the Soviet Union,
Finston said. He said he expects the number of
severely injured Soviet victims will increase in the
coming weeks. "For about four weeks, we'll keep
hearing about more seriously ill."
Finston said Wilson and Kinney were out of
range of serious contamination and were unaware
of the accident until they reached
Leningrad, where Wilson's father
called them to make sure they were
safe.
On the way to the Kiev airport, the
two women, who had been traveling
together in the Soviet Union for two
weeks, asked a cab driver about a
plume of black smoke rising in the
distance, but the cab driver answered
that it wits only a factory, Finston
said.
Rosse had been touring the Soviet
Union with the World Baptist Alli
ance.
None of the women could be
reached for comment.
