# Golfers disappointed by 11th-place finish
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The year 1986 has been a kind of
quest for the Stanford men's golf
team, a quest to recapture the strong
style of play that characterized its fall
1985 season.
The Cardinal has now come all the
way to the Pac-10 Championships,
which begin today at the new Wood
Ranch Golf Course in Simi Valley,
without fulfilling its goal. Stanford
finished 11th in the Sun Devil Inter
collegiate in Scottsdale, Ariz., the
latest in a series of disappointing
finishes.
Stanford's score of 1,124 was 44
over-par and 52 strokes behind
tournament winner Brigham Young,
which won its second straight tour
ney. Arizona State and Florida
finished tied for second at even par,
eight shots behind the Cougars.
"It was kind of disappointing not to
beat UCLA or Oregon," Stanford's
Don Walsworth said. "It just makes
this week that much more important.
(But) I guess our place wasn't that
bad because the field was so good."
BYU had the tourney's top two in
dividuals: Eduardo Herrera and

Brent Franklin. Herrera withstood
his teammate's 67 on the par-72
McCormick Ranch golf course to
finish first, 207-209.
In contrast to the relatively large
number of scores below par, no Card
inal was able to break par on any
round. Carl Wagner led Stanford with
a three-round total of 220, with
Walsworth three swings behind him
at 223.
Phil Rowley and Rich Marik each
finished the Sun Devil at 228, Marik
registering a 72 in Saturday's final
round to keep his score down. Roger
Miraglia and John Dickey wound up
at 231 and 235, respectively.
Stanford now looks to finish in the
top three at the Pac-lOs.
"We're all looking forward to this
week," Walsworth said. "For Carl,
Phil and I, this is our last tournament
other than nationals ... if we don't
fall on our faces.
"Tomorrow I would expect to see
scores go up in the afternoon,"
Walsworth said, citing predicted af
ternoon winds. "If we can play really
well tomorrow afternoon, that could
be the round that decides the tourna
ment."
