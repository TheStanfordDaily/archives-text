# Women earn sole victory
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
If it's any consolation to the Stanford crew
teams, we still have the Axe.
But that is just about all the Cardinal has to
show for its meeting with California in dual
races held at the Oakland Estuary Saturday.
The Cardinal varsity women were the sole
bright spot in what turned out to be a dismal
crew regatta against the Bears. The varsity
women won their race impressively while the
remaining two women's boats and the four
major men's shells finished far in the wake of
the Cal boats.
New training strategies and revamped seating
paid off for the victorious women who picked
up a significant five seconds on their last best
performance this year. "It felt really good,"
Stanford stroke Kathy Shenk said.
The winning margin of eight seconds leaves
no doubt that the women's varsity is ready for
next weekend's Pacific Coast Championships.
The Cardinal had beaten Cal previously this
year, but never by such a large margin. "It just
clicked," Shenk said. "We worked hard on
things this week ... it was a combination of
things."
The rough conditions in the first 1,000 meters
of the race course proved to be not as much of a
problem as the Stanford teams had anticipated,
but it was the last 1,000 that turned out to make
the difference.

"We had a much better last 1,000 than we've
ever had," Shenk said.
The Cardinal JV and frosh women's boats,
having dominated their competition thus far
into the season, lost their winning form. They
were no competition for California, whom they
had previously beaten.
The Cardinal varsity men have yet to find
their winning form. Facing the No. 1 team on
the West Coast, they soon found they had taken
on more than they realized. The Cal men beat
them easily by a nine-second margin. "We knew
Cal was going to be strong," Stanford men's
Coach Ken Dreyfuss said.
The Cardinal strategy of rowing their own
race paid off to some degree, as the margin of
victory was less than in previous years. "We
realized they would be significantly faster, but
we went into each race looking for the win,"
Dreyfuss said. "We rowed the race plan we had
hoped."
As in the women's races, it was not the first
part of the race that made the difference for the
men. "Cal was definitely stronger in the
middle," Dreyfuss said.
The men's JV kept close to the Bears for the
first half of their race, but ran out of steam,
losing by a disappointing seven seconds. The
frosh boat lost also.
The men's novice race was the most exciting
of the day. The lead seesawed throughout the
race, with Cal edging the Stanford boat for a
two-second victory.
