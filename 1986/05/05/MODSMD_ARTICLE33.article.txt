Rockets miss summit site in Japan
TOKYO — Japanese radicals, overcoming an unprecedented blanket
of police security, fired five handmade rockets yesterday toward Tokyo's
Akasaka Palace as opening ceremonies for the seven-nation economic
summit were taking place there.
Police said all the rockets fell far from the building and caused no in
juries or significant damage.
The rocket attack came on a day when mildly radioactive rainfall,
believed to be from the Soviet nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl,
began to fall on several areas of Japan.
Although the rockets fell harmlessly and the radioactivity was not
judged to be life-threatening, the two events provided a grim backdrop
to an economic summit meeting in which the seven national leaders here
spent their first official dinner meeting discussing international terrorism
and the Soviet nuclear accident rather than economics.
The rockets, which apparently carried small explosive charges, flew
unguided for about 2 miles. The nearest hit was about 600 yards away,
but a direct hit on the palace conceivably could have caused serious in
jury or even death at the ceremony.
The metal rockets were fired from tubes sticking out of the window of
an apartment in the city's Shinjuku district, about 1.6 miles from the
palace.
Two of the rockets landed near the Canadian Embassy, located just
outside the large grounds of the palace.
No one had claimed responsibility for the attack as of last night. But
police said the rockets resembled primitive ones used in past attacks by a
leftist group known as the Middle Core Faction.
Waldheim to face runoff election
VIENNA, Austria — Former U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim, seeking to become Austria's head of state despite charges
that he may have participated in Nazi war crimes, narrowly failed to win
a majority of the vote in yesterday's presidential election and a runoff
was scheduled for June 8.
The inconclusive results seemed likely to keep alive the international
controversy over the nature of Waldheim's role in a German military
unit that brutalized Yugoslav partisans and deported Greek Jews to the
Auschwitz death camp during World War 11.
The Interior Ministry announced last night that Waldheim
received 49.6 percent of the votes, just short of the 50 percent he needed
for an outright victory. Socialist candidate Kurt Steyrer won 43.7 per
cent and will be Waldheim's sole opponent in the final round.
An environmentalist candidate, Freda Meissner-Blau, did surprisingly
well, getting 5.5 percent. Polticial commentators speculated that she was
aided by a surge of support following the Soviet nuclear accident. Otto
Scrinzi, a right-wing pan-German nationalist and former Nazi S.S. mem
ber, received 1.2 percent.
Waldheim is favored to win the second round, but Steyrer said he
would put up a strong fight. He noted that he started the campaign with
only 27 percent support and declared that he expected to continue chip
ping away at Waldheim's advantage.
Chernobyl film shows slight damage
MOSCOW — Soviet television broadcast the first moving-film
footage of the site of the Chernobyl nuclear accident yesterday, showing
one reactor building damaged and the surrounding structures apparently
unaffected.
The footage, shot from a helicopter and broadcast nationally on the
evening news, climaxed a day of heavy Soviet publicity, directed abroad,
about the nuclear incident.
Interviews in Western media with Soviet officials Boris Yeltsin and
Georgi Arbatov constituted the most extensive official accounts of the
accident since it occurred and appeared to be part of a concerted
response by the Kremlin to heavy Western criticism of its initial tight
lipped treatment.
Yeltsin, Moscow's Communist Party boss, told The Associated Press
that up to 25 Soviets injured remained in critical condition, and that
49,000 persons had been evacuated from the area — almost twice the
figure estimated four days ago by a Western source here.
Yeltsin said the zone blocked off because of radiation had been
narrowed from 18 to 12 miles around the reactor site. 60 miles north of
Kiev. He said livestock within the 12-mile zone had been slaughtered.
Moscow coupled its stepped-up reporting efforts with an invitation to
Hans Blix, the director of the United Nations' Vienna-based Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency, to come here for talks about the Cher
nobyl situation.
Blix is expected today, along with two senior nuclear-energy and
-safety specialists. An agency spokesman in Vienna said the team would
not go to Chernobyl, and that he did not know how long it would stay.
The Kremlin also dispatched specialists to Poland and Romania to in
vestigate reported damage, Soviet sources said.
Asked why Moscow took so long to give out information, Arbatov
said, "Our first and major concern was not to think about how to give
(information to) the American government or some other government,
but how really to deal with this extremely dangerous situation."
Higher radiation levels in Japan
TOKYO — Increased radiation levels were reported in the rainfall
over central Japan yesterday, prompting the Japanese government to
convene an emergency Cabinet-level working group to assess the situa
tion.
The higher readings of iodine-131 are believed to be related to the So
viet nuclear accident at Chernobyl, which released a radioactive cloud
into the atmosphere that has already threatened much of Europe, ac
cording to Japan's Science and Technology Agency. The agency con
cluded that the additional contamination poses no danger to human
health, but it advised residents of four prefectures, including Tokyo, not
to drink rainwater and to wash vegetables thoroughly.
It has been drizzling for two days in Tokyo, where the leaders of seven
industrialized nations have gathered for their economic summit.
Whenever air or water samples show radiation levels above 3,000
picocuries per liter, the review group is automatically called. It met at 7
a.m. and was chaired by Yohei Kono, director of the Science and Tech
nology Agency.
The group's findings showed the presence of iodine-131, with a half
life of eight days, in rainwater tested in a number of areas. The highest
reading was in Chiba, with 4.000 picocuries. The Tokyo measurement
was 1,700.
A picocurie is 1 - 1.000-billionth of a curie, which means that even the
highest level of 4,000 picocuries per liter (about two pints) is far below
what human beings are able to tolerate.
Afghan party chief resigns
PESHAWAR. Pakistan — Afghan leader Babrak Karmal resigned
yeterday as secretary general of the ruling communist party, in what
seemed to be a further move to broaden the* base of the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul.
Afghan State Radio, monitored here, said Karmal had stepped down
"because of ill health"' and had been replaced by Najibullah. the former
head of the Afghan secret police service, Khad. The new leader has only
one name. Babrak has been rumored to be under treatment for a lung
ailment.

highest level of 4,000 picocuries per liter (about two pints) is far below
what human beings are able to tolerate.
Afghan party chief resigns
PESHAWAR. Pakistan — Afghan leader Babrak Karmal resigned
yeterday as secretary general of the ruling communist party, in what
seemed to be a further move to broaden the* base of the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul.
Afghan State Radio, monitored here, said Karmal had stepped down
"because of ill health"' and had been replaced by Najibullah. the former
head of the Afghan secret police service, Khad. The new leader has only
one name. Babrak has been rumored to be under treatment for a lung
ailment.
Rockets miss summit site in Japan
TOKYO — Japanese radicals, overcoming an unprecedented blanket
of police security, fired five handmade rockets yesterday toward Tokyo's
Akasaka Palace as opening ceremonies for the seven-nation economic
summit were taking place there.
Police said all the rockets fell far from the building and caused no in
juries or significant damage.
The rocket attack came on a day when mildly radioactive rainfall,
believed to be from the Soviet nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl,
began to fall on several areas of Japan.
Although the rockets fell harmlessly and the radioactivity was not
judged to be life-threatening, the two events provided a grim backdrop
to an economic summit meeting in which the seven national leaders here
spent their first official dinner meeting discussing international terrorism
and the Soviet nuclear accident rather than economics.
The rockets, which apparently carried small explosive charges, flew
unguided for about 2 miles. The nearest hit was about 600 yards away,
but a direct hit on the palace conceivably could have caused serious in
jury or even death at the ceremony.
The metal rockets were fired from tubes sticking out of the window of
an apartment in the city's Shinjuku district, about 1.6 miles from the
palace.
Two of the rockets landed near the Canadian Embassy, located just
outside the large grounds of the palace.
No one had claimed responsibility for the attack as of last night. But
police said the rockets resembled primitive ones used in past attacks by a
leftist group known as the Middle Core Faction.
Waldheim to face runoff election
VIENNA, Austria — Former U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim, seeking to become Austria's head of state despite charges
that he may have participated in Nazi war crimes, narrowly failed to win
a majority of the vote in yesterday's presidential election and a runoff
was scheduled for June 8.
The inconclusive results seemed likely to keep alive the international
controversy over the nature of Waldheim's role in a German military
unit that brutalized Yugoslav partisans and deported Greek Jews to the
Auschwitz death camp during World War 11.
The Interior Ministry announced last night that Waldheim
received 49.6 percent of the votes, just short of the 50 percent he needed
for an outright victory. Socialist candidate Kurt Steyrer won 43.7 per
cent and will be Waldheim's sole opponent in the final round.
An environmentalist candidate, Freda Meissner-Blau, did surprisingly
well, getting 5.5 percent. Polticial commentators speculated that she was
aided by a surge of support following the Soviet nuclear accident. Otto
Scrinzi, a right-wing pan-German nationalist and former Nazi S.S. mem
ber, received 1.2 percent.
Waldheim is favored to win the second round, but Steyrer said he
would put up a strong fight. He noted that he started the campaign with
only 27 percent support and declared that he expected to continue chip
ping away at Waldheim's advantage.
Chernobyl film shows slight damage
MOSCOW — Soviet television broadcast the first moving-film
footage of the site of the Chernobyl nuclear accident yesterday, showing
one reactor building damaged and the surrounding structures apparently
unaffected.
The footage, shot from a helicopter and broadcast nationally on the
evening news, climaxed a day of heavy Soviet publicity, directed abroad,
about the nuclear incident.
Interviews in Western media with Soviet officials Boris Yeltsin and
Georgi Arbatov constituted the most extensive official accounts of the
accident since it occurred and appeared to be part of a concerted
response by the Kremlin to heavy Western criticism of its initial tight
lipped treatment.
Yeltsin, Moscow's Communist Party boss, told The Associated Press
that up to 25 Soviets injured remained in critical condition, and that
49,000 persons had been evacuated from the area — almost twice the
figure estimated four days ago by a Western source here.
Yeltsin said the zone blocked off because of radiation had been
narrowed from 18 to 12 miles around the reactor site. 60 miles north of
Kiev. He said livestock within the 12-mile zone had been slaughtered.
Moscow coupled its stepped-up reporting efforts with an invitation to
Hans Blix, the director of the United Nations' Vienna-based Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency, to come here for talks about the Cher
nobyl situation.
Blix is expected today, along with two senior nuclear-energy and
-safety specialists. An agency spokesman in Vienna said the team would
not go to Chernobyl, and that he did not know how long it would stay.
The Kremlin also dispatched specialists to Poland and Romania to in
vestigate reported damage, Soviet sources said.
Asked why Moscow took so long to give out information, Arbatov
said, "Our first and major concern was not to think about how to give
(information to) the American government or some other government,
but how really to deal with this extremely dangerous situation."
Higher radiation levels in Japan
TOKYO — Increased radiation levels were reported in the rainfall
over central Japan yesterday, prompting the Japanese government to
convene an emergency Cabinet-level working group to assess the situa
tion.
The higher readings of iodine-131 are believed to be related to the So
viet nuclear accident at Chernobyl, which released a radioactive cloud
into the atmosphere that has already threatened much of Europe, ac
cording to Japan's Science and Technology Agency. The agency con
cluded that the additional contamination poses no danger to human
health, but it advised residents of four prefectures, including Tokyo, not
to drink rainwater and to wash vegetables thoroughly.
It has been drizzling for two days in Tokyo, where the leaders of seven
industrialized nations have gathered for their economic summit.
Whenever air or water samples show radiation levels above 3,000
picocuries per liter, the review group is automatically called. It met at 7
a.m. and was chaired by Yohei Kono, director of the Science and Tech
nology Agency.
The group's findings showed the presence of iodine-131, with a half
life of eight days, in rainwater tested in a number of areas. The highest
reading was in Chiba, with 4.000 picocuries. The Tokyo measurement
was 1,700.
A picocurie is 1 - 1.000-billionth of a curie, which means that even the
highest level of 4,000 picocuries per liter (about two pints) is far below
what human beings are able to tolerate.
