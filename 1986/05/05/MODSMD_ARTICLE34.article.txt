# Nations agree on 'unified front' approach
## Summit leaders discuss terrorism 
### 
TOKYO — President Reagan and the leaders of
six other industrialized democracies, formally
opening the 12th annual economic summit here,
agreed yesterday to put up a "unified front" to
combat terrorism and to strengthen safety and acci
dent reporting procedures at nuclear power plants.
After a dinner session of nearly three hours,
Reagan said that the summit participants had got
ten off to a good start with "very open and very
strong discussions" of both major political issues.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes, relaying
Reagan's remarks to reporters at a midnight brief
ing, indicated the leaders had been "virtually unan
imous" on the need to take specific action to fight
terrorism and to prevent potentially deadly nuclear
power plant accidents.
While there was apparent agreement among the
allies on nuclear safety issues, Reagan apparently
failed to persuade the other heads of state to con
demn Libya for sponosoring international ter
rorism and to isolate the regime of Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Khadafy, both diplomatically and
economically.
An administration official, briefing reporters on
the condition she not be identified, said that none
of the four leaders who held bilateral sessions with
Reagan on Saturday and Sunday had made a com
mitment to take new economic or political action
against Libya.
Asked if any of the leaders even thought
Reagan's proposal to sever all diplomatic and eco
nomic relations with Libya was a good idea, the of

ficial said, "Everybody said it would be a good idea
to continue to share ideas on what might be done."
And despite the expected formal expression of
unity, sources from several countries represented
here said that serious differences had existed yes
terday on the content of a proposed anti-terrorist
statement.
British sources said that the French and Japanese
still had some "legal questions" about key portions
of the terrorism document.
Prior to yesterday's comments by Speakes on the
terrorism issue, a senior U.S. official had said that
West Germany and Italy were "leery" of a tough
statement calling for specific measures. He said the
French were historically against any separate state
ments on political issues but "would probably go
along with pap," meaning a relatively bland state
ment, in the interest of unity.
The seven leaders will set aside time this morning
to approve the formal nuclear safety and terrorism
declarations. Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro
Abe is scheduled to announce both of them, along
with a separate political statement, this afternoon.
The Soviet Union's failure to acknowledge the
nuclear explosion at Chernobyl until two days after
it happened — and then only after Sweden had re
ported high levels of radiation blowing across its
borders from Chernobyl, hundreds of miles away
— raises serious questions concerning future arms
control talks, several administration officials here
said.
Questioned during a televison interview about
future dealings with the Soviets, White House

Chief of Staff Donald Regan said, "Well, you'll
recall that we've been talking about verification in
terms of disarmament all along. And this teaches us
quite a lesson, that we have to be able to verify
whatever it is that we agree to with the Soviets.
Speakes said the summit leaders agreed that con
crete steps can and should be taken against ter
rorism and that "every leader is concerned and
ready to do his or her part." Without being specific,
he indicated that some leaders might be willing to
take certain actions that they would not want to ac
knowledge publicly.
Reagan had suggested that the summit nations
close down Libya's embassies, or People's Bureaus,
as they are called, and cut all economic ties. The
United States feels that "any economic squeezing
of Libya would send Khadafy a message," Speakes
said.
The summit leaders, while strongly in favor of
better safety and accident reporting procedures in
volving nuclear reactors, "stressed a need for con
tinued use of nuclear energy for peaceful
purposes," Speakes said.
The leaders are especially concerned about the
need for "timely notification" of neighboring
countries when a nuclear accident occurs, Speakes
said. They believe that any country that might suf
fer health and safety problems should be notified
immediately, he said, and that the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency would be the
agency best suited to initiate such an emergency
notification process.
