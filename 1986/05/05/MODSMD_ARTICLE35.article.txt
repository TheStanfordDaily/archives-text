# Soviets dispute summit prospects

TOKYO â€” After nearly a week of
sharp criticism from President
Reagan and other U.S. officials over
its handling of the nuclear plant acci
dent at Chernobyl, the Soviet Union
has questioned whether the United
States is truly interested in a meeting
this year between Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
told the president yesterday.
The question was relayed to
Thatcher by Leonid Zamyatin, the
new Soviet ambassador to Britain,
who asked for her view of the situa
tion as he presented his credentials
late last week, White House spokes
man Larry Speakes said.
Thatcher told Zamyatin that the
United States wants to go forward
with a Reagan-Gorbachev summit

meeting later this year, a statement
that Reagan himself confirmed yes
terday during a diplomatic reception
as the annual seven-nation economic
summit got under way in Tokyo.
"I invited him (Gorbachev),"
Reagan said in response to a
reporter's question. "The invitation's
still good."
Privately, Reagan Administration
officials were skeptical about
Zamyatin's inquiry. One official,
speaking on condition that he not be
identified, suggested that it was a
propaganda ploy to shift the focus at
the economic summit away from the
Soviet Union's mishandling of the
Chernobyl nuclear accident to U.S.
recalcitrance, real or imagined, about
fixing a date for the next superpower
summit.

Since Reagan and Gorbachev first
met in Geneva last November, both
sides have been jockeying over the
date of a second meeting, which they
agreed at their first meeting would be
held in the United States this year.
Washington pushed originally for a
June meeting, while the Soviets
favored a September date. The latter
was too close to Novembers U.S.
congressional elections to suit the
Administration, whose latest position
is that it would now not consider
holding the summit until after the
elections.
Some Administration officials dis
missed the Gorbachev message as a
device to deflect criticism at the
Tokyo summit about the nuclear acci
dent near Kiev.
"It seems to me to be some kind of

a propaganda ploy," one senior offi
cial said. "It's one way to take the
heat off less pleasant subjects like
Chernobyl." He that said they might
have been "anticipating a lot of
Soviet-bashing."
After a working dinner of foreign
ministers at the Tokyo summit Sun
day night, a British spokesman said,
"Most of the ministers were of the
view the Russians do want a summit
sooner rather than later, but that they
weren't sure how to move the matter
along."
But presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes said the United States never
believed the summit really was off.
"It's not the U.S. side that has
postponed it,"he added. "It's the
Soviets."
