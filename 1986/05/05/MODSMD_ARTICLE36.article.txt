NASA ponders "curse"
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — After a quarter
of a century of dazzling space flight that thrilled
the world, U.S. space officials began wondering
yesterday if they are living under some sort of
cosmic curse.
An eerie mood hung over the sprawling Ken
nedy Space Center complex here. The rapid
succession of three straight di asters — the ex
plosion of the Challenger space shuttle, the blow
up of a Titan 34D rocket, and now Saturday's
disintegration over the Atlantic of a Delta rocket,
the country's most dependable launch vehicle —
seemed to many so unlikely as to defy all rules of
logic, not to mention the laws of probability.
Playing out an all-too-familiar scene, Adm.
Richard Truly, NASA associate administrator for
space flight, named an eight-member investigat
ing board Sunday to find out why the three-stage
Delta rocket's main engine abruptly shut off 71
seconds into its flight, causing the vehicle to veer
off course and burst apart 11.3 miles over the At
lantic Ocean.
As it tumbled out of control, the rocket — and
the $57.5 million weather satellite it was carrying
— was destroyed on command by Air Force
range officers 20 seconds later.
NASA spokesman Hugh Harris said inves
tigators are carefully examining all data to find
out what went wrong, including "what radio sig
nals might have been on what radio frequencies
in the area." NASA officials have said that the
engine shut down almost as if it had been com
manded to do so, raising the possibility of inter
ference from a stray radio signal or sabotage.
"I just sat there and said to myself, I can't

believe I'm seeing this," said a glum George Dil
ler, a veteran NASA public affairs official who
watched the Delta accident from inside the
agency's domed press compound, which is
decorated with huge color photgraphs of success
ful rocket launches. "We were so confident about
this, I would have bet you my month's salary we
were going to have a successful launch."
For NASA, the timing couldn't have been
worse. The agency had scheduled a reunion on
Monday to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard's trip aboard
Freedom 7, the country's first manned space
flight.
That such a run of bad luck should strike
NASA, the federal agency that put men on the
moon, seems ironic. That it should happen now,
on the very weekend that NASA was planning its
25th Mercury anniversary party, seems perverse.
Some NASA officials said that the accident will
take the edge off the reunion, and one noted that
"it's going to be a low-key affair."
Spouse abuse arrests rise
NEW YORK — Most of an estimated 300,000
students nationwide who took the college board
test Saturday probably will be offered a make-up
exam because some test booklets contained two
blank pages, a spokesman for the Educational
Testing Service said yesterday.
"Students have the right to take the test in as
normal an atmosphere as possible," said Arthur
Kroll, a vice president for ETS, which
administers the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
Kroll said the omitted questions apparently

resulted from a printing glitch.
"We have egg on our faces," he said. "It's fair
to say we're embarrassed. We apologize to the
students."
Although ETS estimated that only 7,500 stu
dents, or about one in 40, had test booklets with
blank pages, many others may have been dis
tracted by their classmates' dilemma and proc
tors' attempts to solve it, Kroll said.
"Conceivably, every test taker might feel af
fected," he said.
Kroll said all students who took the test prob
ably would be sent letters offering a free make
up, either at a regularly scheduled SAT test or at
their convenience.
Laßouche fails in Texas
DALLAS — Texas voters set up a November
bout between Gov. Mark White and the man he
knocked out of office four years ago, former
Gov. Bill Clements, and overwhelmingly rejected
candidates linked to extremist Lyndon
Laßouche.
But nine nominations for statewide office must
be decided in June 7 runoff elections because no
candidate got more than 50 percent of the vote in
Saturday's primaries.
The success of Laßouche supporters in Illinois
earlier this year failed to spread to Texas. The
lone Laßouche candidate for statewide office
lost resoundingly, and' 10 candidates for congres
sional nominations finished last.
The Texas primary kicked off a busy month of
voting around the country, with elections Tues
day in North Carolina, Ohio and Indiana.
