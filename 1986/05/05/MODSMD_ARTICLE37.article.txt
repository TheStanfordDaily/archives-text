Bush on nuke accident
OXNARD — Vice President George Bush
described yesterday the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant disaster as a "major setback" for the
Soviet Union in the battle for world opinion.
Bush voiced hope that the resulting interna
tional outcry might "mount, grow and build,"
which could nudge the Soviets toward more
openness in such things as arms control and ban
ning of chemical weapons.
In his interview with reporters here. Bush said
one casualty of the Chernobyl nuclear plant ex
plosion was the budding international reputation
of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a deft
communicator.
"We had some hopes, and some were
widespread, that Mr. Gorbachev was going to

lead in a new era of openness. Regrettably, he
hasn't done that," Bush said.
Small plane crashes

single-engine plane, a Mooney Executive 21
aircraft.
A Santa Clara County sheriffs office report
said a Mooney Executive 21 aircraft hit a slope,
slid backwards and turned upside down. There
was no fire.

domestic violence cases between January and
April, a 718 percent increase over the same per
iod in 1985.
