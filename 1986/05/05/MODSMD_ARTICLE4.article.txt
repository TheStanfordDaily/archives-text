# Women discuss national defense
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
The country's largest-ever conference on
the role of women in national security took place
here Saturday.
More than 1,100 women joined a sprinkling of
men in Memorial Auditorium for the first such
meeting hosted at Stanford and the nation's ninth
regional conference.
The day-long program, which hailed female as
sertiveness without sacrificing femininity, featured
talks and panel presentations, a reception, video
and film clips, a resource fair and an evening con
cert by jazz artists Tuck and Patti.
Dr. Anne Cahn, director of the Committee for
National Security, called on women for active and
self-supportive involvement in facing national se
curity issues, saying that women's roles in the poli
tical arena need not be different from those of men.
"You need a group of women to gain active lead
ership at the same time"' so that they can "reinforce
each other's instinct that thev don't have to be
macho,'" Cahn said. Isolated women in power have
had to act "its manly as the men," she said, using as
examples former Indian leader Indira Ghandi and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
"It's difficult when nine men are saying one thing
and you (as a woman) are thinking something
else," Cahn said.

Cahn, the director of the first such national se
curity conference in Washington, D.C. in 1982,
said women add fresh, objective perspectives to na
tional security policies because they have had little
involvement with the Reagan Administration's
policy making.
"Since women are not involved, they don't have
to be defensive about the present policies," she
said. "It's easier for them to say. Hey, this doesn't
make any sense." . . . and 'The emperor isn't
wearing any clothes." "
Cahn said the first conference was designed four
years ago to enlarge the constituency for arms con
trol because, when she began work with the Com
mittee for National Security four years ago,
"women were the largest group that needed to get
involved."
For many women and men in attendance, the
conference discussions extended into such areas of
their personal lives as professional and family
relationships and child rearing.
Conference director Sylvia Rogers said that un
derlying the presentations was "an issue of power,
of diffusing and redefining how it is used" by men
and women. The conference offers "a way of ap
proaching not just this problem (of national secur
ity) but most we face as human beings," she said.
Dr. Benjamin Spock. a political activist and au
thor of "The Baby and Child Care Book." of which
32 million copies have been sold, spoke about
raising children in the nuclear age.

"It's too bad that when the women's movement
surfaced in the '70s that men didn't liberate them
selves,'" Spock said. "It's too bad men didn't realize
that the family is the most important thing because,
in the long run, it's the family which gives you the
satisfaction."
Spock said the nation is increasing existing ten
sions about the fear of nuclear war by promoting
materialism, competition and violence. "We ought
to be ashamed of ourselves," Spock said. "We're
permanently hurting children."
Speaking the day after his 83rd birthday, Spock
said Americans have thrown away a sense of secur
ity by abandoning the pride and values traditionally
staked in the family and in small, cohesive com
munities. "The reason we've eliminated (a sense of
security) is because Americans believe in getting
ahead," he said. "I did it too. I wanted to move to a
bigger place with a bigger future and more pres
tigious jobs."
The struggle for disarmament, better schools and
federally sponsored day care should be fought with
political activity, including discriminate voting and
civil disobedience, Spock said.
"It's important to give kids the feeling they can
do something about improving the nation," he
said.

Women Voters, the American Association of Uni
versity Women. Physicians for Social Responsibil
ity and the Committee for National Security.
