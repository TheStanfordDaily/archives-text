# SUNet cable TV aired to dorms

### RICK KUWAYTI Staff writer 
Programs on the Stanford Uni
versity Network (SUNet) are
being broadcast into student
residences for the first time this
quarter. These programs range
from the effects of cocaine addic
tion to last quarter's Bishop Des
mond Tutu speech.
Most residences are now wired
to receive SUNet, and all are ex
pected to have reception capabil
ity by the end of spring quarter.
The move to a University-wide
video network is still in the experi
mental stages. Presently, the video
programming on SUNet is being
handled by the Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network (SITN),
a division of the School of Engi
neering.
But SITN Director Mary Lou
Allen says SITN will not be able to
sponsor the Stanford-based cable
programs for very long. "This was
the only quarter that I could see
SITN doing this kind of experi
ment,'' she said. "I work for the
School of Engineering, and we

have our own goals. . . . The rea
son we were able to do this is be
cause we had some funds left over
for innovative video projects."
SITN is a profitable business,
generating $5 million per year by
broadcasting four channels of in
structional programming for 12
hours each day to a subscribing
audience of about 2,000. But
handling the University-based
cable system is not part of SITN's
game plan.
"We wanted to show students
and Residential Education the ca
pabilities of such a network." Al
len said of SITN's spring quarter
sponsorship. "I would like to see
part of our staff be able to do
this."
Current programs on SUNet are
being provided by SITN, the De
partment of Communication, Res
Ed and various student groups.
Each group is impressed with the
potential for the cable system.
According to Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose, SUNet has
extraordinary potential in the dor
matories. As an example, Breitrose
cited the monitoring of satellite pro
gramming from countries such as the
Soviet Union, Mexico, Canada and
Japan.
" This would provide not only lan
guage material, but a way to see how
other people look at the world," he
said.
Res Ed program coordinator
Robin Hensley sees SUNet as "really
exciting," but admits that it is still an
experiment. "Right now, people use
video a lot as a catalyst for Res Ed
programming â€” it works well," she
said.
But the question still remains as to
who will organize the cable system
and what form it will take. Allen said
she would like to see a faculty
student group representing Res Ed,
SUNet, SITN and others, which
would be responsible for the system's
direction. "I think we should all work
together," she said.
Breitrose and Hensley agree. "I
would like to see a number of depart
ments having interest in SUNet work
together," Breitrose said, adding that
SUNet television services eventually
would have to fall under the office of
the Vice Provost for Academic Com
puting and Information Systems.
