Programs on the Stanford Uni
versity Network (SUNet) are
being broadcast into student
residences for the first time this
quarter. These programs range
from the effects of cocaine addic
tion to last quarter's Bishop Des
mond Tutu speech.
Most residences are now wired
to receive SUNet, and all are ex
pected to have reception capabil
ity by the end of spring quarter.
The move to a University-wide
video network is still in the experi

programming on SUNet is being
handled by the Stanford Instruc

a division of the School of Engi

But SITN Director Mary Lou
Allen says SITN will not be able to
sponsor the Stanford-based cable
programs for very long. "This was
the only quarter that I could see
SITN doing this kind of experi
ment,'' she said. "I work for the
School of Engineering, and we

have our own goals. . . . The rea
son we were able to do this is be
cause we had some funds left over
for innovative video projects."
SITN is a profitable business,
generating $5 million per year by
broadcasting four channels of in
structional programming for 12
hours each day to a subscribing
audience of about 2,000. But
handling the University-based
cable system is not part of SITN's
game plan.
"We wanted to show students
and Residential Education the ca
pabilities of such a network." Al
len said of SITN's spring quarter
sponsorship. "I would like to see
part of our staff be able to do
this."
Current programs on SUNet are
being provided by SITN, the De
partment of Communication, Res
Ed and various student groups.
Each group is impressed with the
potential for the cable system.
According to Communication
Prof. Henry Breitrose, SUNet has
extraordinary potential in the dor
