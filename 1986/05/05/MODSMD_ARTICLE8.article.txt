### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer With wire reports 
Former U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim captured 49 percent of Austria's
presidential vote yesterday, showing that
Austrians "don't worry much"' about allega
tions that Waldheim participated in Nazi
atrocities during World War 11, according to
a visiting Austrian professor here.
With more than 49 percent of the vote,
Waldheim received the most votes in the
election but fell just short of the absolute
majority needed to win.
He will face socialist party candidate Kurt
Steyrer, who received 43.7 precent of the
vote, in a June 8 runoff election.
Although the office is largely a ceremonial
post, the president does have certain formal
rights which he can use practically if he
chooses to do so, according to Gerhard Botz,
an Austrian professor visiting the History
Department.
"Waldheim says he will use his formal
rights," Botz said. He could use his powers
to perform such functions as dissolving parli
ament, interfering in the appointment of
ministers and vetoing laws passed by the
government, Botz explained.

Ninety percent of 5.4 million eligible
Austrians voted yesterday, a low turn-out for
an Austrian election — suggesting to many
that this year's was the most bitter in
Austria's post-World War II history.
"Usually, the turnout is 95 to 98 percent."
Botz said. "The percentage of non-voters in
dicates that there is great frustration with the
election procedures and candidates among
the Austrian people."
The turnout figures speak to "a kind of
political delegitimatization that has been
going on for a while" in Austria, Botz said.
He cited the Austrian social partnership sys
tem which encourages "strong and perman
ent cooperation of each of the great forces in
society (the socialists and conservatives)" as
a reason for the "depoliticization" of the
people.
Botz also noted the socialists' lack of a
charismatic leader to replace Rudolf
Kirchschlager, who is stepping down at the
end of two six-year terms, as required by
law.
Although the accusations against
Waldheim have forced Austrians to confront
their part in the actions of Hitler's Germany
during World War 11, they have not served to
undercut Waldheim's position, ac
cording to Botz.

"In Austria, there is a kind of
negative heroism. Defeated heroes
are often hailed, " Botz said. "There
is a kind of rejection of people attack
ing from the outside, and there is
some kind of covert anti-Semitism
that remains (from wartime)."
