# Educator calls for innovation
## AFT president delivers keynote address on education in the future 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Facing a severe shortage of teachers in
coming years, the president of the American
Federation of Teachers said here Saturday
that new approaches to improving the
quality of public education are needed in the
United States today.
Albert Shanker, speaking before about
140 people in Cubberly Auditorium, called
on U.S. public schools "to develop a differ
entiated staff' that would include "master
teachers," interns and peer tutors.
Shanker was the keynote speaker at a
day-long conference on education in the
year 2000 presented by the Friends of the
Stanford University School education.
For public education to withstand success
fully the loss of half its 2.2 million teachers
in the next seven years, Shanker said public
schools must hire "those who are truly ex
perts" in their fields.
"If we don't get a fair share of those
people, we don't make it,"he said, noting
that such experts would play a different role
in the operation of schools than other teach
ers play.
"If we want to get our fair share of these
outstanding invididuals .. . they are not to

be treated as workers," Shanker said.
"They will not work within the authority
network that exists in today's schools," he
said, adding that such prized people would
receive higher salaries than other teachers
and would be directly involved the decision
making processes of school operations.
In addition to master teachers, Shanker
called for a greater use of teaching interns
and peer tutors in public schools.
"You need people working in the
schools," he said, noting the difficulty of fil
ling all the vacated spaces with expert teach
ers.
Ideally, public education would like to at
tract "the top half of the top haif of all col
lege graduates," Shanker said. The biggest
concentration of college graduates inter
ested in teaching, however, is in the lowest
25 percent, he said.
He also called for "a much greater use of
technology" in public education.
Shanker said such improvements in the
structure of public education cannot be
achieved without fundamental changes in
"an institution that has looked the same for
200 years.
"None of this will work very well if we
continue to think that all education must go
on in the classroom." he said, calling for

public schools "to link the individual with
some educational experience.
One of the most ineffective methods of
teaching today is for an instructor to simply
talk at a classroom of students without al
lowing any direct experience with the sub
ject matter, he said.
Another possibility for future public edu
cation. though easier to arrive at, would be
disasterous, Shanker said.
"If we continue to mouth the slogans that
we usually mouth, we're headed for dis
aster," he said, noting that increases in
teachers' salaries and class-size reductions
are not enough to improve public education.
Although saying he was not against salary
increases, Shanker said problems would ex
ist even if the average teacher's salary were
increased from $24,000 to $35,000.
Other fields and businesses competing for
employees from the pool of potential teach
ers would raise their salary levels in pace
with educational increases, he said.
Shanker said if class sizes were reduced,
more teachers would have to be hired from
the pool of lower-quality candidates.
"The more you hire, the lower you're
going to go in standards," he said.
"What happens if you bring in dumb
people? You have to watch them very care
fully."
