Answering charges that the Philos
ophy Department canceled a Hoover
senior research fellow's class because
of his connection with the conserva
tive think tank, University Provost
James Rosse next week will release
an 11-page report of his investiga
tion.
Rosse told the Faculty Senate
Thursday that those charges are un
founded, but declined to elaborate
until the report is issued, calling the
controversy "an extremely compli
cated matter."
Admiral James Stockdale had pro
posed to teach Philosophy 76, "Moral
Dilemmmas of War and Peace,"
during winter quarter this year with
Philosophy Prof. Emeritus Philip
Rhinelander, but the Philosophy De
partment did not approve the course.
Stockdale claimed that he had been
informed by "a friend" that the
course was rejected because of the
current controversy between Stan
ford and Hoover.
Rosse said, "I could find no basis
for the charge of the Hoover connec
tion. (But) I did not exonerate the
Philosophy Department or convict
Admiral Stockdale.
"What I discussed and will report
on next week is a set of circumstances
that created some deep misun
derstandings that led to some un
happy decisions," Rosse said.
When Stockdale taught the course
with Rhinelander in 1983-84, the
class drew more than 100 students.
The Philosophy Department said
that the two professors did not submit
adequate information about how the
course would be taught, as is required
for evaluation of all potential courses
in the department.
Julius Moravscik, chairman of the
Philosophy Department, wrote a let
ter about the dispute that was pub
lished in a September 1985 issue of
Campus Report.
"Stockdale's charges imply unethi
cal behavior on the department's part
and on my part. I have not taken his
association with the Hoover Institu
tion into consideration in any deci
sion I have made, nor would I allow
such considerations to affect
departmental deliberations. The
charges are false and must be
retracted," he stated in the letter.
Stockdale, out of town until May
28, could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
Stockdale, who spent eight years as

a prisoner of war in Vietnam, holds
the Congressional Medal of Honor
and is one of the Navy's most highly
decorated members.
Philosophy 76 addresses questions
of force in human affairs, might
versus right and the challenge of war,
peace and moral philosophy.
