# Radioactive rain poses no threat

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff With wire reports 
As radioactive debris from the Soviet nuclear
reactor accident reached Northern California
yesterday, state officials were downplaying the
hazard and not encouraging people from taking
any precautions against exposure.
"The bottom line at this point is there have
been no increased levels of radioactivity," said
Dr. Kenneth Kizer, director of the state Depart
ment ot Health Services. "We don't expect any
thing. People don't need to do anything special."
Worry about contamination in California arose
yesterday when it was reported that a cloud of ra
dioactive iodine had been carried across the
Pacific Ocean toward North America by the jet
stream air current at speeds up to 100 miles-per
hour.
Concern intensified when rain was predicted
and West Coast residents fear that precipitation
would carry radioactive particles to the ground.
But the Environmental Protection Agency said

yesterday the only possibility radiation would
reach the ground was if there were thun
derstorms at altitudes of 20,000 to 30,000 feet.
Doug Atkinson of the National Weather Ser
vice said the rainstorms that hit Northern Cali
fornia late yesterday were much lower, in the
range of 15,000 feet or less.
Stanford Radiology Prof. Roland Finston, the
director of University health physics, has advised
against taking medication to reduce the effects of
radiation, saying that the side effects of iodine
medication outweigh the dangers presented by
radioactivity.
He said Sunday that the Stanford Medical
Center has received calls from several local resi
dents concerned about radiation.
Kizer said he had heard reports that Califor
nians were buying bottled water and gas masks.
However, Finston said results of tests carried
out on three local women last week at the Medi
cal Center indicate there is no danger presented
to people in the United States.
Doctors found traces of radioactive iodine in
the women's thyroid glands, but levels were well

below dangerous levels.
The only possible danger to Americans could
be ingestion of radiation through the food chain,
Finston said.
In a news conference on the roof of the Health
Services Department building yesterday in
Berkeley, Kizer concurred that levels of radioac
tivity measured in the jet stream were too low to
present a health hazard.
He said his department's elaborate monitoring
system was being operated around the clock at 18
sites in an attempt to detect even the most minute
amounts.
Meanwhile, many European countries have re
ported radiation levels have returned to normal,
although some continue to take precautionary
measures.
In Austria, the health ministry said airborne
radiation was almost back to usual levels but
advised against eating leafy vegetables because of
higher than normal ground levels. Great Britain,
Belgium, Finland, France and Norway reported
noticable but declining levels.
