In the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in
the Soviet Union, it is time that we take a critical look
at our own nuclear plants.
Of the 15 large U.S. reactors, nine share common
characteristics with the Chernobyl reactor. The reactor
most similar in design to the Ukrainian plant — the
Hanford site in southeastern Washington — experi
ences 10 times the safety-related shutdowns as the
average commerical site. The Hanford site uses both a
graphite block in the reactor and operates without an
airtight steel-and-concrete containment building to
trap escaping radiation — both design features that
contributed to the Chernobyl disaster.
Experts say the Hanford site is in need of a multi
million dollar refurbishment. Its fuel tubes are warping
with age and the interior of the reactor is scaling. The
plant, designed in the late 19505, does not meet Nu
clear Regulatory Commission standards, yet it is ex
empt from inspection from the NRC because it
produces weapon-grade plutonium and is under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Energy.
Unfortunately, the Hanford site is not unique: of the
nine sites, only one meets the NRC safety codes for
commercial reactors.
It seems as if the United States has forgotten that
we, too, had a nuclear accident seven years ago at

Three Mile Island. The Pennsylvania plant was
equipped with full containment buildings, a safety
feature required by the NRC that has undoubtedly
saved lives. The containment buildings were able to
trap huge amounts of radiation and withstand a hydro
gen explosion — a pressure far in excess of that which
the non-commercial reactors under the jurisdiction of
the Department of Energy are designed to withstand.
It is estimated that installing airtight containment
buildings would cost around $850 million each.
Coupled with the modernization needed at many of the
older plants, this is a substantial cost. Apparently, it is
one that the government, especially the Department of
Energy, is unwilling to pay. The DOE maintains that
full containment facilities are not cost effective, and
that the plants pose a relatively low risk. Yet it is a risk
that most of us would rather not take. It seems only
logical that both commercial and non-commericial
plants should be subjected to the same stringent stand
ards, and instead of cutting corners, the government
should be looking to save lives, especially in light of
Chernobyl.
Now is time to decide whether to continue with the
current nuclear energy program and pay the price of
installing safety features, or to terminate the program
altogether.
