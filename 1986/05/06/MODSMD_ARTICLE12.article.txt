# Fabulous Freddie Fender
## 
### 
I have a friend whose parents are both medical doctors.
He's often told me of family dinners during which his par
ents would discuss specific patient cases, medical
breakthroughs or the latest in stethoscopes. When he was
too young to know better, he allowed them to take him to
work and unveil for him the wonders of the medical
world.
I too had parents who brought their professions home
with them. Although they rarely discussed their chemistry
experiments at the dinner table (it was difficult enough
getting us to eat our eggplant without the additional bur-

den of boredom), their scientific background nevertheless
would surface at the oddest occasions. They never overtly
expressed an interest in making their children little scien
tists; however, in their own surreptitious and conniving
manner, they somehow managed to transform every small
opportunity into a learning experience.
Take for instance Fabulous Freddie Fender Frog. He
was the prize frog on the block. From what I remember,
he couldn't have been more than a half-inch long; despite
his slight build, everyone adored him, especially my
brother — the proud owner of Fabulous Freddie Fender
Frog. In fact, it was my brother who took the frog out that
one fateful Saturday. A perfect day to entertain the frog
and maybe even show him off a bit, he thought. Momen
tarily forgetting that frogs typically jump forward and
skateboards typically roll forward, my brother placed
FFFF in the guest of honor's seat (the front of his
skateboard), and they took off. Sure enough, not five
minutes later, my brother dejectedly re-entered the
house; in his hand lay the once energetic animal — flat
tened, but very much alive. Not allowing the opportunity
to slip by, my mother jumped to her feet and exclaimed
that all was not lost; we could save it. She sped off to her
lab and returned 10 minutes later, clutching a flask of eth
er and some curious-looking metallic utensils. We
checked — FFFF was still breathing, but was obviously in
a state of shock. We put him to sleep, cleaned him up a
bit and closed him up as neatly as we could. I proudly
supplied the final element — a band-aid, which enveloped
his entire body. We left him sleeping on the operating

table. One hour later, he was still sleeping. He never woke
up. He had a decent burial, though.
I'll never forget the look on my mother's face — that
mixed look of gleaming pride and comforting satisfaction.
It was an untrustworthy countenance, I thought at the
time. She seemed to be thinking that she was influencing
her children in just the right way and that if all of her ac
tions were calculated and executed accurately, her
children would emerge as perfect human beings. We
would represent the epitome of the bright, young minds of
the future.
I can't help sensing an eerie type of kinship with
Fabulous Freddie Fender Frog: I too was an experiment,
an excellent opportunity to exploit and manipulate, an ex
ternal laboratory experiment from which one could expect
some result. Its success, however, was contingent upon the
quality and precision of the techniques employed, the ac
curacy of the knowledge drilled into me, and the per
tinence and timing of outside influences.
It is a strange and uncomfortable feeling. I often
wonder if I constitute the happy result of a successful ex
periment or merely the embarrassing remains of one
chalked up to experience. It introduces yet another ques
tion which presents itself to every individual at some point

fluences; can we be manipulated into thinking, acting and
being one way; or does there exist some integral core in
each one of us which asserts its integrity regardless of the
extraneous factors that others, in this case parents, impose
upon us? I realize that these are all lofty questions which
require a rigorous philosophical examination, one which I
am not prepared to pursue. I wrote this column, prin
cipally because Fabulous Freddie Fender Frog was on my
mind. It was his birthday last Monday.
