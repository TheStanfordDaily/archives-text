SOSA's activities
counterproductive
As a freshman who is involved nei
ther for nor against the divestment
movement at Stanford, I believe that
I can offer a viewpoint that may be
shared by many. Stanford Out of
South Africa has been very strong in
pushing the administration to divest,
yet, in my opinion, SOSA has ap
proached this in the wrong way. At
first I found SOSA's attempts to
publicize divestment very informative
and positive, but there is a point to
which this publicizing can be taken.
The first shantytown in White Plaza
helped SOSA make its point very
well, and I saw it as an effective
method of publicizing their interests.
After one month the shantytown was
no longer necessary, because every
student had seen it, and by two
months it was merely an eyesore. It
was probably for this simple reason
that someone destroyed it. I am not
omitting the possibility that it might
have been a racist act, but as a person
who tends to believe in the better side
of people, I find it difficult to believe
that it was purely a racist act.
I am writing this letter in specific
response to SOSA's promise to build
a shanty a day until University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy agrees to their
terms. It has finally gotten ridiculous
and has come to the point where I
doubt either side will give in. I will
even admit that I became so sick of
the vehement publicity for divest

ment that I voted against it. I have
admitted this merely to prove my
point; SOSA is losing support from
people like me who are for divest
ment, because the method they are
using is alienating students. Kennedy
is not immune to this alienation,
either. I see SOSA's methods as only
increasing the tension between the
administration and SOSA until noth
ing can be accomplished because
there only exists resentment on both
sides. I only hope a better method can
be found before we reach this point.
Bryan Cooperrider
Freshman, undeclared
In the wake of all the recent
developments concerning divestment
from companies doing business in
South Africa, a few unanswered
questions come to mind:
• Why does SOSA (and most of the
campus, by this time) see such a com
plex problem in such concrete, abso
lute terms? Why is it that Bishop
Desmond Tutu is seen as "right" and
South African President P.W. Botha
as "wrong," rather than opposing ex
tremists? Surely the solution is not to
follow one extremist's plan and
ignore the other — what happened to
compromise?
• Why does SOSA keep building
shantytowns when University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has stated that
it will do nothing to influence his
opinions? He said he would continue
to listen to rational arguments; surely
SOSA could come up with a few ra

tional arguments why divestment is
the best solution Stanford can offer.
• Just because Kennedy and the ad
ministration aren't doing what SOSA
wants (i.e. divesting), why are we so
quick to discredit their reasons for
not doing so and label them "racist"?
Perhaps we should entertain the idea
that Kennedy doesn't value money
over human lives, but rather feels that
there are better ways of solving the
problem of apartheid than divest
ment.
Perhaps what the campus needs is
more thought and fewer shantytowns.
If SOSA genuinely wishes to abolish
apartheid, it should go about it in an
effective and intelligent, rather than
noisy, manner. I support the disman
tling of apartheid, but I do not sup
port shantytown structures on my
campus. I am not racist; I merely feel
that if one is going to "question au
thority," one should listen to the an
swer.

Preserve humans
In the letter to the editor "Preserve
the grass" (Daily, May 1), some os
tensibly sensitive student expressed
his upset over the destruction of the
grass that the shantytown caused.
This has not been a unique opinion
on this campus or on others with
respect to their shanties.
I am immediately reminded of a
similar historical phenomenon. In

Nazi Germany, while they were car
rying out the "final solution" on the
Jews and gays of Europe, some
"concerned" souls started a campaign
to "save the cats" from destruction.
Although I enjoy grass and the con
tinuation of the ecosystem and I have
only contempt for those who
renounce their responsibilities for
their fellow human being in the guise
of caring about another lifeform. In
the case of the grass, it will grow
back, but the lives of the South
Africans taken by apartheid will not.
It sometimes requires the uglifying
of our own surroundings to bring
awareness of an even larger evil. And
especially if this awareness might lead
to actions which could allow the
resolution of the problem. Every year
50,000 die on bantustans from mal
nutrition, and forgive me if I
prioritize the condition of a patch of
grass lower than that of the condition
of millions of people.
So my question is: Why is a patch
of grass more important than ending
human degradation? My sense is that
it is for the same reason that some
Germans decided to care about stray
cats rather than take action to stop
the smell of burning flesh at
Auschwitz.
In the meantime, be thankful that
here only a patch of grass has been
injured. Far more has been done in
South Africa and if decisive action is
not taken, far more will happen here
as well.
