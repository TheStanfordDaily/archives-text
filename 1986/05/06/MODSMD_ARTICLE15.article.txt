## Nuclear power is suicide 
### 
It was a horrible and painful death. Over a period of a
few hours, vomiting, hemorrhaging and stomach pains
were followed by seizures, convulsive brain damage and,
finally and mercifully, death. As many as 2,000 Russians
in the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are
thought to have died this way on Sunday. In the months to
come, many more will undoubtedly die more slowly,
though no less painfully, from radiation sickness. Decades
from now this week's disaster will still be killing people
through leukemia, lung cancer, bone cancer, stomach can
cer, birth defects and miscarriages. Not all of these victims
will be Russians, since the radioactivity has started to dis
perse across many countries.
When will we ever learn?

For decades nuclear apologists have accused thocc
questioning the safety of nuclear energy of neurotic
scaremongering and irrational thinking. They have argued
that far more people have died coal mining and oil drilling
than generating nuclear power. (The mathematics have,
tragically, shifted against the nuclear apologists since the
weekend.) And they have insisted that nuclear power
plants have too many safety devices for accidents to hap
pen.
The record shows otherwise:
• In 1957 the Windscale nuclear plant in Britain melted
down. Thirty-nine people died as a result.
• The 1957 Kyshtym Disaster: an explosion of nuclear
waste killed or injured thousands of Russians and
destroyed several villages.
• In 1958 an accident at the Chalk River Reactor,
Canada, contaminated the surrounding area.
• In 1961 the Idaho Falls Reactor went out of control, kil
ling three people immediately (one impaled by a reactor
rod).
• In 1966 a partial meltdown occurred at the Enrico
Fermi reactor near Detroit, Mich.
• In 1969 a partial fuel meltdown occurred at the Saint-
Laurent reactor in France.
• In 1974 an explosion occurred at the Shevchenko plant
in Russia.
• In 1979 a partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, Penn.,
contaminated the surrounding area.
• In 1979 the accidental release of enriched uranium in
Tennessee contaminated 1,000 people.
• In 1986 an accident at the Kerr-McGee plant in Okla
homa killed one person immediately, sent 100 to the
hospital and contaminated the surrounding area.

Last week the California courts gave the final go-ahead

to fire up the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. This plant is
built right on the San Andreas Fault. Pacific Gas &
Electric claims the plant is earthquake-proof, but many of
the men involved in building it have testified, despite
threats against them, that the plant contains too many
design and construction flaws to be safe. When there is a
major earthquake in California or if Diablo Canyon is
bombed during a conventional war, then we may share the
fate of the good people of Chernobyl.
When will we ever learn?
Meanwhile, to add to our problems, the Navy is plan
ning to homeport the nuclear battleship, the Missouri, and
its support ships in the Bay Area. Navy officials insist that,
thanks to extensive safety measures, there is no danger of
Bay Area residents being hurt in an accident caused by
the Missouri. However, despite "extensive safety precau
tions" in the past, there have been accidents. In 1958 a B
-47E accidentally dropped a nuclear bomb (which, fortun
ately, did not explode) into the vegetable garden of
Walter Gregg in South Carolina. In 1961 a B-52 acciden
tally dropped two nuclear bombs on a North Carolina
farm. Several safety switches failed. "Only a single switch
prevented the bomb from detonating," according to nu
clear physicist Ralph Lapp? In 1980 a Titan II missile in
Arkansas exploded during routine maintenance, sending
its nuclear warhead 600 feet.
Anthropologists working with tribal peoples have found
that they are always able to explain the failure of a magic
spell or a witch-doctor without calling their whole belief
system into question. "The ritual wasn't done properly,"
or "someone used stronger counter-magic," they say. We
have the same blind faith in our nuclear witch-doctors.
"Our nuclear plants are different from the Russians," we
say. "Our scientists are better than the Russians," we say.
"Now that it's happened once we know how to stop it
happening again," we say.
When will we ever learn?
Hypnotized by the assurances of our leaders and ex
perts, we are like the people of Jonestown. As Jim Jones
prepared the cyanide for his followers, telling them they
had no choice but to take it, they kept their trust in him to
the very bitter end, to the point of suicide. As our leaders
assure us that accidents don't happen, rationalizing away
each accident that does happen, as the nuclear reactors
proliferate and the bombs pile up, as the scientists deny
the link between the cancer epidemic and radioactive
leaks, we trust the assurances of our revered leaders. No
one shouts that the emperor has no clothes.
How many more deaths will it take to break the spell in
Jonestown?
