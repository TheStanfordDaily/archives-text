## Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper, too? 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug Me,
I've been a Sugar Free Dr. Pepper
fan since high school. But a few
months ago I noticed that the can now
says "Diet Dr. Pepper" instead of
"Sugar Free Dr. Pepper." This is a
very recent change because there are
still some SFDP cans left in the stores.
Why is SFDP now "Diet"? Is there a
difference? Is it a new formula like
New Coke was? What will the new
commercial jingle be?
- Kimmy Carter
Okay, so this question doesn't pack
cosmic significance, but it's classic
Bug Me fodder because it's an issue
that a lot of people might be wonder
ing about and by which at least one
person is seriously bugged. Besides,
after last week's ideologically charged
column, it's time to lighten up a bit.
The Dr. Pepper Company is head
quartered in Dallas, Texas, and here's
what Bill Walker of their sales de
partment had to tell me:
When Dr. Pepper originally came
out with a sugar-free version of its
product, it was called "Diet Dr. Pep
per." But the sugar substitute in that
drink — some chemical that Walker
couldn't remember the exact name of
— was found to be cancer-causing.
The company switched to saccharine,
and in an apparent attempt to dis
tance the product from the car
cinogen scare, it also switched the
name of the drink itself, to "Sugar
Free Dr. Pepper."
That name stuck through the sub
sequent transition to "NutraSweet,"
but Walker says that Dr. Pepper ex
ecutives found that "old timers" were
still calling the drink "Diet
Dr. Pepper" (probably attached to
the alliteration).
So Dr. Pepper decided to go back
to "Diet Dr. Pepper," since
everybody (or at least the more

entrenched clientele) calls it that,
anyway.
It's the exact same drink as before,
still sugar-free, still in the pretty
azure cans. As for the commercial
jingle, Walker said that there is
already a whole new ad campaign out
for DDP, including radio spots
featuring Dr. Ruth. How Dr. Ruth is
even remotely connected with diet
soda pop is anybody's guess. Maybe
NutraSweet has been identified as an
aphrodisiac, in which case the fact
that a huge number of Stanford stu
dents seem to be addicted to Diet
Coke takes on a whole new meaning.
But that's another question, for an
other day.

Dearest Brother Bug Me,
Some time ago, as I was gazing
heavenward during Mass in Mem
Chu, I noticed that one of the
lightbulbs waaaay up in the dome had
burned out. Pondering this, I hypothe
sized that it would require either an act
of God or else silly amounts of scaf
folding to change it, since there
doesn't appear to be any sort of bal
cony or doorway up there. The other
day, I again glanced skyward and Lo!
the unforunate bulb had been trans
formed! It is even now steadfastly
blazing forth, clothed in all its former
luminous glory. How did this miracle
come to pass?
- Three Hasn 't
So how many Stanford employees
does it take to change a lightbulb? In
this case only one, according to Edie
Bridges, secretary to the Dean of the
Chapel. Bridges said that there is a
room above the chapel's East Room,
and from there one has access to a

catwalk that runs around the dome.
While on this catwalk, a worker can
reach an arm through to change the
bulbs.
The bulbs in the chandeliers that
hang over the pews are another mat
ter, however. Bridges said that scaf
folding is necessary to change those
lights. The scaffolding is brought in
once a year, and all those lights are
changed at once, according to
Bridges.
Dear Bug Me,
How do the folks at the Corner
Pocket pick the fro yo flavors? Why
doesn 't the chocolate taste better? Do
the styrofoam cups they serve the stuff
contain any asbestos?
- Don Ho
Co Po Student Manager Nick Nic
holson was very helpful when I in
quired about this. He said that the
flavors aren't scheduled weeks, or
even days, in advance. Rather, the Co
Po folks keep a calendar of flavors
served each day, and as each succeed
ing day comes along, they look back
at the calendar and choose the day's
flavors based on which flavors were
served or not served in the recent
past. Or so I understood it.
As for the chocolate, Nicholson
said that there haven't been any
recent modifications in that flavor's
recipe or formula. In fact, Nicholson
said, chocolate is one of the most
popular flavors. In addition, the Co
Po is currently in the process of
producing a survey regarding Co Po
products. This survey will allow stu
dents to express their opinions about
favorite pizza toppings, fro yo flavors
and so on. Then the Co Po"will tailor
services to the preferences ex
pressed," according to Nicholson.
Nicholson also assured me that
there is no asbestos in the fro yo cups.
So you can eat up without consumer
paranoia. But you might have to set
tle for chocolate fro yo.

- Kimmy Carter
Okay, so this question doesn't pack
cosmic significance, but it's classic
Bug Me fodder because it's an issue
that a lot of people might be wonder
ing about and by which at least one
person is seriously bugged. Besides,
after last week's ideologically charged
column, it's time to lighten up a bit.
The Dr. Pepper Company is head
quartered in Dallas, Texas, and here's
what Bill Walker of their sales de
partment had to tell me:
When Dr. Pepper originally came
out with a sugar-free version of its
product, it was called "Diet Dr. Pep
per." But the sugar substitute in that
drink — some chemical that Walker
couldn't remember the exact name of
— was found to be cancer-causing.
The company switched to saccharine,
and in an apparent attempt to dis
tance the product from the car
cinogen scare, it also switched the
name of the drink itself, to "Sugar
Free Dr. Pepper."
That name stuck through the sub
sequent transition to "NutraSweet,"
but Walker says that Dr. Pepper ex
ecutives found that "old timers" were
still calling the drink "Diet
Dr. Pepper" (probably attached to
the alliteration).
So Dr. Pepper decided to go back
to "Diet Dr. Pepper," since
everybody (or at least the more

entrenched clientele) calls it that,
anyway.
It's the exact same drink as before,
still sugar-free, still in the pretty
azure cans. As for the commercial
jingle, Walker said that there is
already a whole new ad campaign out
for DDP, including radio spots
featuring Dr. Ruth. How Dr. Ruth is
even remotely connected with diet
soda pop is anybody's guess. Maybe
NutraSweet has been identified as an
aphrodisiac, in which case the fact
that a huge number of Stanford stu
dents seem to be addicted to Diet
Coke takes on a whole new meaning.
But that's another question, for an
other day.

Dearest Brother Bug Me,
Some time ago, as I was gazing
heavenward during Mass in Mem
Chu, I noticed that one of the
lightbulbs waaaay up in the dome had
burned out. Pondering this, I hypothe
sized that it would require either an act
of God or else silly amounts of scaf
folding to change it, since there
doesn't appear to be any sort of bal
cony or doorway up there. The other
day, I again glanced skyward and Lo!
the unforunate bulb had been trans
formed! It is even now steadfastly
blazing forth, clothed in all its former
luminous glory. How did this miracle
come to pass?

So how many Stanford employees
does it take to change a lightbulb? In
this case only one, according to Edie
Bridges, secretary to the Dean of the
Chapel. Bridges said that there is a
room above the chapel's East Room,
and from there one has access to a

catwalk that runs around the dome.
While on this catwalk, a worker can
reach an arm through to change the
bulbs.
The bulbs in the chandeliers that
hang over the pews are another mat
ter, however. Bridges said that scaf
folding is necessary to change those
lights. The scaffolding is brought in
once a year, and all those lights are
changed at once, according to
Bridges.
Dear Bug Me,
How do the folks at the Corner
Pocket pick the fro yo flavors? Why
doesn 't the chocolate taste better? Do
the styrofoam cups they serve the stuff
contain any asbestos?
- Don Ho
Co Po Student Manager Nick Nic
holson was very helpful when I in
quired about this. He said that the
flavors aren't scheduled weeks, or
even days, in advance. Rather, the Co
Po folks keep a calendar of flavors
served each day, and as each succeed
ing day comes along, they look back
at the calendar and choose the day's
flavors based on which flavors were
served or not served in the recent
past. Or so I understood it.
As for the chocolate, Nicholson
said that there haven't been any
recent modifications in that flavor's
recipe or formula. In fact, Nicholson
said, chocolate is one of the most
popular flavors. In addition, the Co
Po is currently in the process of
producing a survey regarding Co Po
products. This survey will allow stu
dents to express their opinions about
favorite pizza toppings, fro yo flavors
and so on. Then the Co Po"will tailor
services to the preferences ex
pressed," according to Nicholson.
Nicholson also assured me that
there is no asbestos in the fro yo cups.
So you can eat up without consumer
paranoia. But you might have to set
tle for chocolate fro yo.

Dear Bug Me,
I've been a Sugar Free Dr. Pepper
fan since high school. But a few
months ago I noticed that the can now
says "Diet Dr. Pepper" instead of
"Sugar Free Dr. Pepper." This is a
very recent change because there are
still some SFDP cans left in the stores.
Why is SFDP now "Diet"? Is there a
difference? Is it a new formula like
New Coke was? What will the new
commercial jingle be?
