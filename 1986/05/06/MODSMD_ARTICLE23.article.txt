## UC-Davis visits Sunken Diamond Stanford prepares for pivotal weekend 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
All good things must come to an
end.
The Stanford baseball team's regu
lar season has been a good thing
indeed. But it must end this week,
with the team hosting non-conference
opponent UC-Davis this afternoon at
Sunken Diamond before traveling to
St. Mary's Louis Guisto Field for the
last non-conference game of the year.
The Cardinal will then conclude
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion play with a three-game series
against California. That series opens
on Friday at Cal's Evans Diamond.
Unless Stanford is selected to host
NCAA regional playoff action, this
afternoon's 2:30 p.m. contest and
Saturday's game with the Golden
Bears are Stanford fans' last chances
to see their team in action at Sunken
Diamond this year.
But this probably won't be the end
of the line for the team. Stanford
stands in good position to be selected
for postseason play. The Cardinal
(16-11 in the Six-Pac, 32-19 overall)
is currently in sole possession of
second place in the Six-Pac, two
games behind league-leading UCLA,
and a game ahead of third-place
Arizona. The league champion gets
an automatic postseason spot; at least
one, and maybe two other Six-Pac
teams will be invited to the NCAA
tournament.
Stanford could virtually assure it
self of a playoff spot by taking at least
two of three from Cal this weekend.
In that event, even if Arizona swept
its last three conference games to pull
even with Stanford numerically, the
Cardinal would be awarded second
place by virtue of its 4-2 series edge
over the Wildcats this season.
And if Stanford should happen to
pull even with UCLA after this
weekend's conclusion of Six-Pac play,
Stanford would be declared the
league champ because it holds a
similar 4-2 margin over the Bruins as
well.
But the Cardinal can't look past the
last-place Bears. Cal was picked by
most pre-season prognosticators to
win the Six-Pac title. Although the
team has fallen far short of those ex
pectations, the Bears have come .on
strong in recent weeks, winning seven

of their last nine games and sweeping
sixth-ranked Oral Roberts in non
conference action this past weekend.
Stanford will tune up for the Cal
series with non-conference games
today and tomorrow. This after
noon's opponent, UC-Davis, brings a
23-21 season record and a 14-13
Northern California Athletic Confer
ence mark into the game. The Card
inal pounded the Aggies last season
20-5 at Davis.
The Aggies' probable starter is
Gary Rowe, a senior right-hander
with a 7-3 season mark and 4.11
ERA. The UC-Davis batting attack is
spearheaded by junior left fielder
Steve Roberts, a .331 hitter who has
blasted 17 home runs this season and
30 in the last two years. Roberts has
62 RBIs on the year.
Stanford's hitting attack continues
to be led by catcher John Ramos and
right fielder Toi Cook, both juniors.
Ramos leads the team with a .350
season average and also has 50 runs,
37 RBIs, 13 doubles and four home
runs. The four home runs lead the
team, along with third baseman
Ruben Amaro and center fielder
Mark Davis, who also have four.
Cook, meanwhile, has been going
crazy at the plate ever since being
moved to the No. 4 spot in the batting
order 16 games ago. In those 16
games, Cook is hitting .456 with 19
RBI and 19 runs scored. He has hit
safely in 14 of those 16 games, with
multiple-hit performances in nine of
the contests. He was 8-for-13 in last
weekend's crucial three-game series
with Arizona.
Pitching, however, continues to be
the Cardinal's strongest suit. The
pitching staff sports a collective ERA
of 3.69 for the year, and delivered
three complete-game performances
in the Arizona series.
"Arizona came in batting .334 as a
team, and we pitched three complete
games, giving up only nine runs," said
Stanford Asst. Coach Dean Stotz.
"That's incredible in college
baseball."
If the old adage that good pitching
always beats good hitting holds true,
then Stanford's deep, talented pitch
ing staff gives the team a decided
edge as it approaches postseason
play.


Arizona catcher Steve Strong went down, but Ken Green was out in
Stanford's 8-3 win over the Wildcats on Sunday. Although Green was
retired, his bowling over of Strong typified the-Cardinal's aggressive
baserunning style that helped it knock Arizona back into third place in

the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division. By taking two of the three
weekend games, Stanford moved one game ahead of Arizona, two
games behind league-leading UCLA. The Cardinal meets California
this weekend in its final Six-Pac series.
The staff is led by sophomore ace
Jack McDowell, 9-4 with a league
leading 2.50 ERA after a heart
breaking 2-1 loss to the Wildcats on
Friday. McDowell turned in one of
his best outings of the year in that
game, giving up only seven hits and
two runs to the treacherous Wildcat
lineup in nine innings.
The likely pitchers for this after
noon's and tomorrow's games, ac
cording to Stotz, are freshman Steve
Chitren (2-4, 4.04 ERA), junior Rob
Wassenaar (5-1, 4.37) and junior A 1
Osuna (6-2, 4.88). After some mid
season struggles, Chitren has been
strong of late, allowing no earned
runs in his last 11 innings of action.
Wassenaar is 3-0 with a 2.59 ERA in
his last eight appearances, over 24.1
innings.
The Cardinal batting order and de
fensive lineup seemed to click in the
last two games of the Arizona series.
The offense generated 22 hits and 22
runs in those two games, while the
defense, with Mark Machtolf in
stalled at second base, turned over
seven double plays.
One question mark is left fielder
Walt Harris, who was hit twice by
pitched balls in Sunday's game, both
times in his right ankle. Stotz said that
Harris might rest during this week's
non-conference action, but would
definitely play in the weekend series
with Cal.

Kevin Kunkel surrendered 14 hits last Saturday against Arizona, but he
induced the Wildcats to hit into five double plays, allowing him to post a
complete-game victory in the Cardinal's 14-4 triumph.

Arizona catcher Steve Strong went down, but Ken Green was out in
Stanford's 8-3 win over the Wildcats on Sunday. Although Green was
retired, his bowling over of Strong typified the-Cardinal's aggressive
baserunning style that helped it knock Arizona back into third place in

the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division. By taking two of the three
weekend games, Stanford moved one game ahead of Arizona, two
games behind league-leading UCLA. The Cardinal meets California
this weekend in its final Six-Pac series.
The staff is led by sophomore ace
Jack McDowell, 9-4 with a league
leading 2.50 ERA after a heart
breaking 2-1 loss to the Wildcats on
Friday. McDowell turned in one of
his best outings of the year in that
game, giving up only seven hits and
two runs to the treacherous Wildcat
lineup in nine innings.
The likely pitchers for this after
noon's and tomorrow's games, ac
cording to Stotz, are freshman Steve
Chitren (2-4, 4.04 ERA), junior Rob
Wassenaar (5-1, 4.37) and junior A 1
Osuna (6-2, 4.88). After some mid
season struggles, Chitren has been
strong of late, allowing no earned
runs in his last 11 innings of action.
Wassenaar is 3-0 with a 2.59 ERA in
his last eight appearances, over 24.1
innings.
The Cardinal batting order and de
fensive lineup seemed to click in the
last two games of the Arizona series.
The offense generated 22 hits and 22
runs in those two games, while the
defense, with Mark Machtolf in
stalled at second base, turned over
seven double plays.
One question mark is left fielder
Walt Harris, who was hit twice by
pitched balls in Sunday's game, both
times in his right ankle. Stotz said that
Harris might rest during this week's
non-conference action, but would
definitely play in the weekend series
with Cal.

Kevin Kunkel surrendered 14 hits last Saturday against Arizona, but he
induced the Wildcats to hit into five double plays, allowing him to post a
complete-game victory in the Cardinal's 14-4 triumph.
All good things must come to an
end.
The Stanford baseball team's regu
lar season has been a good thing
indeed. But it must end this week,
with the team hosting non-conference
opponent UC-Davis this afternoon at
Sunken Diamond before traveling to
St. Mary's Louis Guisto Field for the
last non-conference game of the year.
The Cardinal will then conclude
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion play with a three-game series
against California. That series opens
on Friday at Cal's Evans Diamond.
Unless Stanford is selected to host
NCAA regional playoff action, this
afternoon's 2:30 p.m. contest and
Saturday's game with the Golden
Bears are Stanford fans' last chances
to see their team in action at Sunken
Diamond this year.
But this probably won't be the end
of the line for the team. Stanford
stands in good position to be selected
for postseason play. The Cardinal
(16-11 in the Six-Pac, 32-19 overall)
is currently in sole possession of
second place in the Six-Pac, two
games behind league-leading UCLA,
and a game ahead of third-place
Arizona. The league champion gets
an automatic postseason spot; at least
one, and maybe two other Six-Pac
teams will be invited to the NCAA
tournament.
Stanford could virtually assure it
self of a playoff spot by taking at least
two of three from Cal this weekend.
In that event, even if Arizona swept
its last three conference games to pull
even with Stanford numerically, the
Cardinal would be awarded second
place by virtue of its 4-2 series edge
over the Wildcats this season.
And if Stanford should happen to
pull even with UCLA after this
weekend's conclusion of Six-Pac play,
Stanford would be declared the
league champ because it holds a
similar 4-2 margin over the Bruins as
well.
But the Cardinal can't look past the
last-place Bears. Cal was picked by
most pre-season prognosticators to
win the Six-Pac title. Although the
team has fallen far short of those ex
pectations, the Bears have come .on
strong in recent weeks, winning seven

of their last nine games and sweeping
sixth-ranked Oral Roberts in non
conference action this past weekend.
Stanford will tune up for the Cal
series with non-conference games
today and tomorrow. This after
noon's opponent, UC-Davis, brings a
23-21 season record and a 14-13
Northern California Athletic Confer
ence mark into the game. The Card
inal pounded the Aggies last season
20-5 at Davis.
The Aggies' probable starter is
Gary Rowe, a senior right-hander
with a 7-3 season mark and 4.11
ERA. The UC-Davis batting attack is
spearheaded by junior left fielder
Steve Roberts, a .331 hitter who has
blasted 17 home runs this season and
30 in the last two years. Roberts has
62 RBIs on the year.
Stanford's hitting attack continues
to be led by catcher John Ramos and
right fielder Toi Cook, both juniors.
Ramos leads the team with a .350
season average and also has 50 runs,
37 RBIs, 13 doubles and four home
runs. The four home runs lead the
team, along with third baseman
Ruben Amaro and center fielder
Mark Davis, who also have four.
Cook, meanwhile, has been going
crazy at the plate ever since being
moved to the No. 4 spot in the batting
order 16 games ago. In those 16
games, Cook is hitting .456 with 19
RBI and 19 runs scored. He has hit
safely in 14 of those 16 games, with
multiple-hit performances in nine of
the contests. He was 8-for-13 in last
weekend's crucial three-game series
with Arizona.
Pitching, however, continues to be
the Cardinal's strongest suit. The
pitching staff sports a collective ERA
of 3.69 for the year, and delivered
three complete-game performances
in the Arizona series.
"Arizona came in batting .334 as a
team, and we pitched three complete
games, giving up only nine runs," said
Stanford Asst. Coach Dean Stotz.
"That's incredible in college
baseball."
If the old adage that good pitching
always beats good hitting holds true,
then Stanford's deep, talented pitch
ing staff gives the team a decided
edge as it approaches postseason
play.
