# Golfers move to 5th at Pacific 10 tourney
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Eighty-over-par. Normally,
when a team has shot that badly
after half a tournament, it might as
well get on the next flight home.
But the Stanford men's golf team
is staying where it is. Its two-round
total of 800 (when 720 works out to
be par) still leaves it right in the
hunt for a good finish at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships in
Simi Valley.
"It's a great golf course," Stan
ford Coach Tim Schaaf said of the
16-month-old par-72 Wood Ranch
Golf Course, "(but) unequivocally
it's the hardest golf course we've
played since I've been here (at
Stanford).
"Out of the entire field of 60
players, there were only 17 that
broke 160, which is an average of
80," Schaaf said. "Although it (the
wind) did blow some, it was not a
tough day. One of the two best
amateurs in the United States is
leading the tournament at three
over par — he's the only guy under
150."
That would be USC's Sam Ran
dolph, who shot the only even-par
round of the day yesterday morning
on his way to a score of 147. Stan
ford's Don Walsworth is in second
place at 150 after shooting a pair of
755.
"(Walsworth) played very well,"
Schaaf said. "In fact, he's respon
sible for us being where we are,
which is in position to finish in the
top three."
Oddly, Stanford's score im
proved in the afternoon round, al
though windier conditions made
the course even more challenging.
Rich Marik, Carl Wagner and John
Dickey each contributed to Stan
ford's rise from eighth place after
the first round with lower afternoon
scores. Marik ended the day at 159,
Wagner at 162 and Dickey at 164.
Roger Miraglia also stands at
164, while Phil Rowley is at 170.
Rowley's day averages to 85, but
again, it must be remembered that
85 is not as bad as it might sound.
"Several teams counted a score
in the 905," Schaaf said. "A player

from Washington State had a 103,
and while they're not a great team,
they're a legitimate varsity golf
team."
Nevertheless, Schaaf would not
want it implied that the team is
satisfied with its performance.
"It's the last tournament of the
season," he said. "With the selec
tion committee, it's tough to know
exactly what we have to do (to get
an NCAA tournament berth).
"The most important matchups
are with Oregon, Oregon State and

UCLA." Schaaf said. "Losing to all
three of those would not rule us out
of the NCAAs, but it would make
the picture pretty muddy."
Currently, the Cardinal trails
third-place UCLA by 11 strokes
and fourth-place Oregon by six.
However, OSU, in fourth place
after the first round, struggled to a
428 in the afternoon and fell to
eighth. 24 strokes behind Stanford.
"In order to be sure (of the
berth) we've got a little work cut
out the next two days," Schaaf said.

Phil Rowley's 170 for 36 holes yesterday at the Pacific 10 Confer
