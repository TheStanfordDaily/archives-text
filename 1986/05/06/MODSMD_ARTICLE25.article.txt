## 
### EVAN TUCHINSKY Staff writer 
It's Big Game time once again, as the Stanford Softball
team meets its old rival California in the season finale at
Baylands Field today at 1 p.m.
"Cal's a very strong team, but I think we're up for
them," Stanford Coach Kathy Lincoln said.
The teams last clashed Feb. 22 at Berkeley. In that win
tertime doubleheader, California emerged victorious,
leaving Stanford with a 0-4 record compared to its 4-0
start. This time the Cardinal hopes to turn the tables.
Betsy Watson will pitch the first game tomorrow, and
Lisa Buchanan will meet Lisa Martinez of California in
the second. As with last weekend's games in Arizona,
pitching and hitting will be crucial for a Cardinal victory.
"Cal is a good hitting team, with solid hitters and solid
pitchers," Lincoln said. "Our pitchers have to be good to
shut them down."
Lincoln believes that Stanford's chances for an upset
will be good. "We have an emotional edge over Cal," she

noted. "Our two graduating seniors want to go out with a
bang."
Kathy Dominguez and Anna Sanchez are the seniors
she referred to, and they are the players Lincoln will be
looking to for key performances. "Kathy and Anna are
our strongest hitters, and if they hit well they can spark
the whole team," Lincoln added.
Dominguez has been batting .290 for a good portion of
the season, and has driven in a lion-sized share of the
Cardinal's runs, including a two-run base hit against Santa
Clara two weeks ago. Sanchez has also come up with some
key hits and has been a catalyst for the Stanford squad.
Lincoln also feels that California may be in a slump,
giving Stanford a further edge. "They are a hot and cold
team, " she said, "and they've lost a few games lately, so
they may be doing it now. They just haven't been hitting
the ball lately.
"When we played them at Berkeley we stuck with
them," she added, affirming her confidence that a Card
inal upset may be in the works.
