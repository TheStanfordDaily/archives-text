# St. John's star to turn pro
## When Berry said he'd stay, it wasn't the truth 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Walter
Berry, the college basketball Player
of the Year whose nickname is "the
Truth"and who insisted two weeks
ago that he would return to St. John's
University for his senior year, said
yesterday that he had decided to turn
professional.
The 6-foot-8 Berry, who played
center in college but will be a forward
in the NBA, submitted his name by
mail Saturday to become eligible for
the league's June 17 draft.
"You hate to lose a player like
Walter," St. John's Coach Lou Car
nesecca said, "but this is progress,
this is life. Every player wants to go
into the big leagues."
When Berry was named The Asso
ciated Press Player of the Year in
March, he said he intended to return
to St. John's." Being the No. 1 pick in
the draft is the only thing that could
change my mind." he said.
And on April 21, he said the
deadline to declare for eligibility "is
gonna come and go and I'll still be at
St. John's." But by the time the
deadline had passed at midnight Sat
urday, Berrv's letter of intent was on

its way to the league. The NBA said it
required only a letter with a postmark
beating the deadline to ensure
eligibility, rather than a public an
nouncement.
Asked why he changed his mind.
Berry said. "All I know in my heart is
that I want to play" in the NBA. "No
matter where I get picked, I've got to
live with it. Right now, all I want to
do is get on a team.
"This year was a great one for me,
and still I was criticized that 1 was not
top-notch material," added Berry,
who averaged 23 points and 11.1
rebounds per game and set a school
record with 76 blocked shots. "If my
stock would go down a great deal
next year, if I had a poor season, they
would forget about everything and
then where would I be? So this is why
I feel I have to go now."
After Berry received the AP Player
of the Year Award before the NCAA
Final Four at Dallas and said he
would not turn pro unless he was
assured of going No. 1 in the draft,
NBA superscout Marty Blake said
Berry didn't measure up to that level.
"He's not ready to play at our level
yet," Blake said then. "He'd better

stay in school, work on his outside
shot, handling the hall, shooting the
jumper. Walter is an inside player
right now. He can't do that in pro
ball."
Yesterday, Blake, interviewed by
telephone from his Atlanta office,
declined to discuss Berry specifically
or any of the other undergraduates
until the NBA formally announces
their eligibility later this week.
But when asked to rank the best
forwards, Blake mentioned Len Bias
of Maryland, Chuck F'erson of
Auburn, Kenny Walker of Kentucky
and Brad Sellers of Ohio State. And
he said he wouldn't include Berry,
regardless of whether he was formally
eligible.
"When you speak of undergradu
ates," Blake added, "I don't perceive
guys making too big an impact. An
impact, yes. but not a big one."
Along with Berry, underclassmen
who have decided to turn pro include
William Bedford of Memphis State,
Michael Graham (not currently regis
tered in school), Chris Washburn of
North Carolina State, Syracuse's
Dwaync "Pearl" Washington and
John Williams of Louisiana State.
