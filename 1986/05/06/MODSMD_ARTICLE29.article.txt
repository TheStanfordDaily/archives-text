### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) â€” Ricky Pierce scored 19
points and Paul Pressey 17, and they combined for 17 in
the final period, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to a 109-
104 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers last night and
deadlocking their NBA playoff series at two games
apiece.
The Bucks, Central Division champions, regained the
homecourt edge in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinal series and will meet the 76ers in Milwaukee for
Game 5 Wednesday night. The sixth game is in Philadel
phia Friday night.
Milwaukee won despite 37 points by the 76ers' Charles
Barkley, who received an award earlier yesterday as the
top player in the NBA based on a computerized evalua
tion of all statistical categories.
The teams battled through an even first half in which
they were tied at 27 after a period and at 60 at halftime.
In the third quarter, the score was tied six times, the last
at 76-76, before Milwaukee scored eight straight to lead

84-76 with 1:42 left. But Barkley and Julius Erving hit
jumpers to reduce the deficit to 84-80 at the end of the
period.
Milwaukee built its lead to 93-86 with 8:29 remaining,
but the 76ers again pecked away at the margin until they
gained the lead at 101-99 on a three-point play by
Barkley with 3:23 left.
Pierce responded with a three-point play of his own to
give Milwaukee the lead again, but Maurice Cheeks tied it
with a technical free throw on a Bucks' illegal defense.
Then, Pressey converted two free throws after being
fouled by Barkley, putting the Bucks ahead for good at
104-102 with 1:46 on the clock.
Pressey, who scored nine points in the fourth period
and all of his 17 in the second half, hit a jumper for a four
point lead before Barkley came back with two free throws
to make it 106-104 with 46 seconds left.
Pressey iced the victory at the 25-second mark with two
more free throws.
