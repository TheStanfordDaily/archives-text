# Expert puts blame on Gorbachev
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
The nuclear accident at the Chernobyl reactor
followed soon after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev ordered increased electrical production in the
region where the plant is located, an expert on So
viet affairs said yesterday.
Due to the increase in electrical generation, the
situation at the reactor "got out of control,"
Spanish and Portuguese Prof. Emeritus Ronald
Hilton said. Hilton is editor of World Affairs
Report, a quarterly publication that analyzes the
Soviet press.
The Chernobyl reactor, located 60 miles north of
the Ukranian capital of Kiev, exploded April 26
after experiencing a cooling system failure the pre
vious day.

Safety conditions at the reactor were neglected
as energy officials in the region succumbed to pres
sure from Gorbachev to increase electrical genera
tion, according to Hilton.
"Gorbachev is responsible because he turned on
(the production of electricity) full blast," he said.
At the same time they are calling for greater
electrical output, the Soviets are attempting to
boost the production of milk, according to Hilton.
Milk is one of the region's most dangerous drinks
because of radiation contamination, he said.
As a result of the accident, Gorbachev's image as
a "forthcoming new individual in the Soviet sys
tem" has been damaged, Hilton said.
Gorbachev's attempts to modernize the Soviet
bureaucracy have resulted only in the same "tight,
authoritarian regime with a new facade," he said.
Stanford scholars monitoring Soviet television
news broadcasts to Siberia over the weekend said

extensive coverage of conventional electric power
generation suggests the country may now be facing
energy shortages and possible brownouts.
Louis Lerman, who has been monitoring the So
viet transmissions, said a detailed translation and
analysis of the broadcasts would be available within
the next few days.
Scholars monitor the major domestic news pro
gram daily at 1:30 a.m. PST on a campus tracking
station. Only major events are monitored.
The Stanford tracking system was developed by
Stuart Neubarth, who recently completed his work
as a graduate student in electrical engineering. Sup
ported by the Hoover Institution, the Department
of Slavic Languages and Literatures and other
donors, the station is expected by this summer to
become the most automated tracking, receiving
and distributing system for Soviet TV on any U.S.
campus.
