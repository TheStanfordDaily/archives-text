# N.Y. loses 3rd to Montreal
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Claude
Lemieux's breakaway goal at 9:41
of overtime last night gave the
Montreal Canadiens a 4-3 victory
over the New York Rangers and a
commanding 3-0 lead in their NHL
Stanley Cup semifinal round
playoff series.
The Canadiens can sweep the
best-of-seven Wales Conference
final with a victory in Game 4 at
Madison Square Garden tomorrow
night.
The winner of this series will go
on to the NHL championship round
against the winner of the Campbell
Conference final between Calgary
and St. Louis.
The Rangers, who outshot the

Canadiens 12-4 in the third period,
also had several excellent opportu
nities to score early in overtime.
But they were blunted by the
acrobatic saves of Montreal rookie
goaltender Patrick Roy.
Most of the overtime period, in
which Roy stopped 13 shots, was
played in the Montreal zone. But
the opportunistic Canadiens, who
had only three shots in the extra
period, made one of theirs count.
Mike McPhee set up the winning
goal when he blocked a mid-ice
shot by New York's Willie Huber,
roared down the left wing and fed
Lemieux in the slot.
The Montreal rookie right wing
beat goalie John Vanbiesbrouck

high on the glove side for his eighth
goal of the playoffs.
The win was only the third in
Montreal's last 18 overtime ap
pearances, dating back to last year's
playoffs.
The Canadiens tied it 3-3 on
Bobby Smith's power-play goal
with 2:04 remaining in regulation.
New York's Brian MacLellan was
in the penalty box for holding when
Smith put a backhander from the
slot over Vanbiesbrouck's glove.
Defenseman Larry Robinson, who
earlier in the period set up a goal by
Mats Naslund, passed to Smith.
Montreal scored its two third
period goals on only four shots.
