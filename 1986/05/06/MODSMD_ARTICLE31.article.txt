Women's water polo
One bad spurt in a sports match can cost a team a
national championship. Just ask the Stanford
women's water polo team.
The Cardinal fell behind 7-1 at halftime against
UC-San Diego before mounting a comeback that
fell short as San Diego won 11-9 at the national
finals. Stanford finished as the runner-up in the
tournament with a 3-1-1 record, having defeated
Bucknell, Harvard and UC-Davis handily while
losing to UCSD and tying Slippery Rock. UCSD
went a perfect 5-0 to capture the title.
We were looking for the championship, so it
was disappointing," Stanford's Lorna Thornton
said.
"We were hoping to win the tournament," Card
inal Coach Bob Wu agreed. "We had lost to San
Diego at our own tournament before, but a lot of
our players were sick. We were confident.
The players and coaches alike were surprised at
the shaky start. "It was more or less nervousness at
the beginning," Wu said. "Once we settled down,
we played the way we should have."
After the beginning of the match, the Cardinal
outplayed UCSD but could not make up the differ
ence. "The fact that we came back showed what
kind of team we are," Wu said.

Men's lacrosse
Even though it had advanced to the semifinals of
the West Coast Collegiate Lacrosse Association
playoffs, the Stanford men's lacrosse team never
really stood a chance against Whittier Friday.
"We went into the game a little intimidated,"
Stanford's Peter Haven said. "Whittier is without a
doubt the best college team on the West Coast.
They have a very good program."
Whittier, which had defeated the Cardinal 22-16
earlier in the season, proved once again that it was
superior to Stanford with a 22-12 victory Friday.
The Cardinal fell behind early, rallied to within
two goals, but was never able to come close to
taking the lead. "After that (the early deficit), we
started to settle down," Haven said. "(But) the
outcome was never in question. At the end, they
just started to pour it on."
Stanford was led by its midfielders, senior John
Cox and junior Greg Simon. Cox, in his last game
as a Cardinal, scored three goals and Simon added
two.
"Whittier has beaten us pretty handily," said
Haven. "There's no doubt they're the best team in
the league."
Cox and Simon were joined by Cardinal seniors

as members of the North squad in the WCCLA
All-Star Game on Saturday.
Cycling
The Stanford cycling team did not let poor
weather and road conditions prevent it from ear
ning a big victory at the Davis Road Race last Sat
urday. The team's 250 points came close to the
maximum score possible in a road race.
The high tally moved Stanford within striking
distance of Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, the leader of
the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference.
Stanford stripes came across the finish line 1-2-3
in the "A" race, with Tom Moyer, Mike Fadich and
Mike Collins winning easily. In the women's race,
Laura Rodman, Pam Stevenson and Jenifer Hub
bert finished only slightly less powerfully, with first,
second and fourth places, respectively.
In the "B" races, Stanford again dominated the
top places. Ed Reus finished second, Dave Bar
tholomew fourth and Hank Dart fifth.
Tim Robinson, Tom McMinn and Carlos
Fuentes rounded out the scoring for the Cardinal
with second, fourth and eighth place finishes,
respectively, in the "C" race.
