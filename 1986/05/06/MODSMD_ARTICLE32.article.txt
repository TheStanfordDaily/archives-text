Soviets try to stop river pollution
MOSCOW — The Soviet government said yesterday that it is trying to
prevent contamination of a major river in the Ukraine from radiation
emitted in the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
And for the first time since the accident occurred more than a week
ago, Soviet television viewers were shown tests for radioactivity on a
farm about 50 miles from the damaged reactor at Chernobyl. The read
ings, on vegetables, were reported to be within normal limits.
Radiation in the Ukraine and in neighboring Byelorussia, the govern
ment said in a statement, is "stabilizing, with a tendency toward im
provement."
A man interviewed for television on a street in Kiev, about 80 miles
south of Chernobyl, said there is no panic in the Ukrainian capital but
added that "people are worried."
This relatively frank statement, which contrasts sharply with the scant
information that has been disclosed officially, came as a team of three
top officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. entity
headquartered in Vienna, arrived for talks with Soviet experts.
Hans Blix, a Swede, the lAEA's director-general, headed the team,
which also included Leonid Konstantinov, a Soviet who is a senior offi
cer with the agency's nuclear safety and environmental protection de
partment, and Morris Rowen, a U.S. expert on nuclear power plant
safety.
The government statement said that the emission of radioactive gases
from the No. 4 reactor at the nuclear power plant was continuing, but at
a decreasing rate.
The government also indicated, for the first time here, that everyone
within a 19-mile radius of the reactor was evacuated after the leak of ra
dioactive gas.
Deadline set for Libyan withdrawl
The Reagan Administration, seeking to heighten the economic pres
sure on the Libyan regime of Col. Moammar Khadafy, said yesterday
that it has set a deadline for the dozen U.S. oil and gas companies still
operating in Libya to pull out of that nation.
Top Administration officials conceded that the continued presence of
U.S. companies in Libya has undermined White House efforts to per
suade other countries to impose sanctions against Libya in response to
Libyan-sponsored terrorist attacks.
Secretary of State George Shultz disclosed the setting of the deadline
during the seven-nation economic summit meeting in Tokyo. The ses
sion produced a pledge yesterday to take concerted action against ter
rorist nations.
Shultz and others refused to say when the deadline is, on grounds that
the United States does not want Libya to know the date. Spokesmen for
several of the affected oil companies said yesterday that they have not
been told anything, but Administration officials left the impression that
the deadline has been in place for some time.
Shultz indicated that it is soon, and added that the companies might
have to abandon their assets to the Libyans. Several of the companies
said they have tried without luck to sell their Libyan holdings since Janu
ary, when President Reagan barred Americans from doing business with
Libya.
Since then, the oil companies have been operating under special
licenses that require them to place their Libyan revenues in escrow and
to take steps to dismantle operations in that country. The Administra
tion had said it hoped to give the companies time to sell their holdings
rather than have them seized by the Libyans.
Occidental and the other companies made little comment yesterday
except to say they will continue to abide by the wishes of the U.S. gov
ernment.
Turkish quake leaves eight dead
ANKARA, Turkey — Eight people were killed and 40 injured when
an earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale rocked Turkey's eas
tern and southeastern provinces early yesterday, state radio reported.
The report revised downward an earlier official toll of at least 15 dead
and 100 injured.
Ouoting government authorities, the radio said lake water was being
drained from behind Malatya province's Surgu Dam, which cracked in
the quake. Villages in the vicinity had been evacuated.
Prime Minister Turgut Ozal pledged speedy relief to survivors, and a
campaign for donations has begun.
Turkey is located on an active earthquake belt, and its remote eastern
provinces have been the scene of major disasters.
Statistics put the loss of life in 36 major earthquakes since the turn of
the century at 71,000. The worst Turkish quake disaster was in the eas
tern town of Erzincan in 1939, where 45,000 died.
Afghanistan, Pakistan resume talks
GENEVA — Indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan on a
peace settlement in Afghanistan were resumed here yesterday, but be
cause of the sudden change Sunday in the Communist Party leadership
in Afghanistan, there is little hope for progress on any early agreement.
Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator, told the press after meeting sep
arately with the Afghan and Pakistani foreign ministers, "We have
reached a very decisive stage, and I am extremely concerned about the
consequences for the people of Afghanistan if we fail."
Cordovez refused to comment on the leadership change in Kabul,
where President Babrak Karmal has been replaced by Maj. Gen.
Najibulla. It was Karmal who in December of 1979 asked Moscow to
send troops to Afghanistan to help control a guerrilla insurgency.
Najibulla, until recently head of the secret police, has been in overall
charge of security operations.
The agenda, Cordovez said, is down to virtually one item — a
timetable for withdrawal of the Soviet troops, now estimated to number
115,000. Pakistan wants the Soviet troops out within six months of a
settlement, but Afghanistan wants them to stay on for four years.
At previous meetings, the Afghan delegation refused to discuss a pos
sible timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet forces unless the two sides
could meet face to face. But on this occasion, the Afghans accepted the
indirect arrangement.
The Pakistanis have taken a hard line in refusing to recognize the Kar
mal regime because Karmal is responsible for the Soviet military pres
ence.
Nations take on monetary reform
TOKYO — A major new agreement to manage the international
monetary system to curb erratic fluctuations in the dollar and other cur
rencies will be announced by the seven economic summit nations today,
Treasury Secretary James Baker 111 said yesterday.
The agreement — including frequent reviews of economic perfor
mance — represents the most significant attempt in more than 13 years
by the world's leading noncommunist nations to achieve international
economic coordination.
If the new system succeeds in making exchange rate relationships
more stable, it will make it easier for businesses to make long-range
plans. When exchange rates fluctuate widely, as they have in the past six
or seven years, business executives cannot be sure whether their prod
ucts will suddenly face stiff import competition or whether their exports
will be cheap or expensive.
It was unclear whether the seven industrial nations had agreed yester
day on what they believed were acceptable exchange rates between the
U.S. dollar, the world's key currency, and the currencies of other major
industrial nations.
