# Summit group condemns Libya
## 
### 
TOKYO — Leaders of the seven nations attend
ing the economic summit conference here vowed
yesterday to fight terrorism "relentlessly and with
out compromise" and singled out Libya for action.
But they left the politically sensitive question of
economic sanctions to be considered privately by
each country. Further, they failed to give any sign
of approval for the recent U.S. bombing raid
against Libya.
On the first working day of the 12th annual eco
nomic summit meeting, the leaders also approved a
statement criticizing the Soviet's handling of the
Chernobyl nuclear power accident.
Decrying the "blatant and cynical use" of ter
rorism "as an instrument of government policy,"
the leaders approved a statement that went some
what beyond the measures backed last month by
Western European foreign ministers.
It also was the first time Japan had agreed to a
document identifying Libya as a source of state
sponsored terrorism.
While repeating familiar themes, the statement
also promised more forceful actions against ter
rorism than were approved by the allies following
the 1984 London summit.
A senior U.S. official said that while the
measures were "not spectacular," the "strength of
the wording" and"the evolution which we expect

to take place" by individual countries' actions will
contribute to Libya's problems.
The measures agreed to yesterday include im
proved extradition procedures for bringing to trial
those accused of terrorist acts and more restrictive
rules of entry for persons suspected or accused of
terrorist acts.
Other measures include restrictions on arms
sales to nations sponsoring terrorists, limits on their
diplomatic missions and personnel, and closer
cooperation between law enforcement authorities.
Privately, according to an informed U.S. official,
some allies have agreed to take other steps as well,
including monitoring of a wide variety of Libyan fi
nancial transactions to try to trace the source of
money for terrorist operations, monitoring or
closing down Islamic Call Societies, which channel
Libyan funds to a wide range of projects world
wide, and their bank accounts in European
countries, and closing down Libyan front groups.
Secretary of State George Shultz predicted yes
terday's statement could further isolate Libya at a
time when the Reagan Administration believes the
regime of Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy is
already on edge after the U.S. bombing raid last
month.
"I think you'll see a gradual rolling in of the iso

lation of Libya — diplomatically, politically,
economically," he said.
In a final day of jockeying over the declaration,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the
lead in pushing the other leaders to explicitly name
Libya in the document and also to include a call for
improved extradition procedures for bringing
accused terrorists to justice, European and U.S.
sources said.
At a dinner Sunday night, the sources said,
Thatcher, backed by Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, had called for a strong statement by
the summit partners.
President Reagan had circulated a 10-page paper
with his views, including that the allies should
"hold out prominently the possibility of using mili
tary force" to fight terrorism.
France had refused to allow U.S. warplanes to
use its airspace in the raid. In the dinner meeting,
the sources said, French President Francois Mit
terand was reluctant to make as strong a statement
as Thatcher was seeking, and particularly unwilling
to name Libya.
The strong language in the final statement
brought exultations from Shultz, who said the
document will send a message to Khadafy: "You've
had it, pal."
