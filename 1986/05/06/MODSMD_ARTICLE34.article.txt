# Court helps death penalty
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme
Court, rejecting a sweeping constitu
tional challenge to capital punish
ment, ruled yesterday that unyielding
opponents of the death penalty may
be excluded from juries deciding the
guilt or innocence of defendants in
capital cases.
In a far-reaching 6-3 decision, the
court refused to accept the contention
that barring jurors who could never
vote for the death penalty unfairly
forced defendants in such cases to
face "conviction-prone" juries.
The practice of excluding such
jurors, long followed in California
and other states that allow capital
punishment, does not deny defen
dants their constitutional rights to an
impartial jury reflecting a fair-cross
section of the community, the court
said in an opinion by Justice William
Rehnquist.

The ruling, according to authorita
tive estimates, affects not only most
pending appeals among the 1,714
inmates now on Death Row, but also
perhaps several thousand other capi
tal cases in which convicted defen
dants ultimately received prison sen
tences instead of death. In many such
cases, however, retrials are being
sought on other issues as well.
It also represented a substantial
setback to death penalty foes who
saw the case as one of the few
remaining broad-based attacks on
capital punishment. One other major
constitutional challenge, now pending
in a petition seeking Supreme Court
review, contends that the death
penalty is far more likely to be
imposed when defendants are black
and their victims are white.
The court's three dissenters bitterly
assailed the ruling. Justice Thurgood

Marshall, in an opinion joined by
Justices William Brennan Jr. and
John Paul Stevens, accused the
majority of giving prosecutors an un
fair advantage "with a glib non
chalance ill-suited to the gravity of
the issue."
"'Such a blatant disregard for the
rights of a capital defendant offends
logic, fairness and the Constitution,"
Marshall wrote.
John Charles Boger of the NAACP
Legal Defense and Education Fund
Inc., one of the attorneys represent
ing an Arkansas inmate in the case
before the court, expressed sharp dis
appointment.
"We thought the evidence showed
overwhelmingly that the practice
biased the verdicts of capital juries in
favor of the state," Boger said. "This
was one of the major unresolved con
stitutional questions on the horizon."

The decision overturned a ruling by
a federal appeals court striking down
the exclusion of death penalty foes as
a violation of the right to a fair trial.
In other action, the Supreme
Court, evoking memories of the
Scopes "monkey trial," agreed yes
terday to decide whether the Consti
tution allows states to require public
schools that teach evolution also to
conduct courses on the creation the
ory of the origin of life.
The justices will review in the term
beginning next October a controver
sial Louisiana law that was struck
down by a federal appeals court as
violating the prohibition against gov
ernment establishment of religion.
The law, called the "Balanced
Treatment for Creation-Science and
Evolution-Science Act," says that
creation must be taught whenever
evolution is taught in public schools.
