Rocket failure found
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — NASA inves
tigators said yesterday that the failure of a Delta
rocket over the Atlantic Saturday night ap
parently was caused by two powerful surges of
electricity that drained power from the battery in
the first-stage engine, choking off the rocket's
fuel supply 71 seconds after liftoff.
Although investigators said they cannot yet
pinpoint the cause of the electrical malfunction,
they are sufficiently concerned about the Delta's
engine system to advise postponing the upcoming
launch of an Atlas Centaur rocket, the nation's
only large launch vehicle not grounded by a
recent failure. The Atlas Centaur has a similar
engine system made by the same company,
Rockwell International's Rocketdyne division.
Even temporarily grounding the Atlas Centaur
will leave the country with no means of orbiting
heavy military and commercial satellites, because
the shuttle and the Titan and Delta rockets are
officially grounded pending accident investiga
tions.
Tax overhaul closer
WASHINGTON — The Senate Finance Com
mittee edged gingerly toward approving sweep
ing changes in the federal income tax system yes
terday, strongly praising legislation that would
tax four of every five Americans at a 15 percent
rate and exempt 6 million low-income people

from paying taxes altogether.
The legislation, perhaps the most radical of
several tax measures proposed in the last year by
the White House and its Democratic critics,
scraps the current maze of tax brackets, deduc
tions and so-called loopholes in favor of a simpler
two-tier system with only a handful of tax breaks.
The plan would finance the lowered tax rates
by wiping out about $50 billion in tax shelters
now used by upper-income Americans and col
lecting an additional $93 billion to $103 billion
from corporate tax changes. In addition, it would
end popular deductions now used by many tax
payers, including those for sales taxes, miscel
laneous expenses such as union dues, and I RAs
when a taxpayer is covered by another pension
plan.
The corporate changes would lower the maxi
mum tax rate to 33 percent, compared with the
current 46 percent, but they also would institute
a minimum tax, abolish investment tax credits
and make other accounting changes that would
boost overall revenue.
Voters sick of rhetoric
RALEIGH, N.C. — The powerful, right-wing
political machine of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)
appears headed for an embarrassing defeat in
today's North Carolina primary election — an in
dication that home-state voters may be growing
weary of the highly confrontational style of the
senator and his supporters.

The chief issue in the race has been the
negative campaign style of Helms political action
committee, the Congressional Club, which has
thrived on direct-mail fund raising and negative
television advertising since the senator's first suc
cessful Senate bid in 1972.
Yet there is evidence that politicans in North
Carolina are beginning to see an advantage in
openly shunning negative campaigns. For exam
ple, David Price, a leading Democratic candidate
for Congress, is running on a platform that con
demns "the dirty campaigning (that) has taken
over North Carolina politics."
Market out of slump
NEW YORK — The stock market broke out
of last week's slump yesterday with a rally attrib
uted partly to declines in interest rates.
But analysts said the pace of trading, which
was the slowest in more than three months, cast
some doubts on the decisiveness and durability of
the advance.
Analysts said stocks attracted some buying by
traders who believed that last week's selloff was
excessive given the circumstances that prompted
it.
One of those worries was the prospect of the
record $27 billion sale of debt securities slated by
the Treasury for this week. But as the new
trading week began, fears apparently eased that
that large new supply of bonds and notes would
push interest rates higher.
