Spy alleges henpecking
SAN FRANCISCO — Confessed spymaster
John Walker testified yesterday he paid his wife
to keep quiet about his espionage activities after
she broke into his desk in 1968 and found in
structions from Soviet agents about dropping off
secret information.
Walker, who has admitted running a spy ring
that supplied the Soviets with secrets about Navy
communications systems for 17 years, went
through his first day of cross-examination as the
chief prosecution witness against Jerry Whit
worth, his former friend and alleged prize recruit
into espionage.
Whitworth, 46, who is a retired Navy radioman
from Davis, is accused of selling secrets for
$332,000 to Walker for relay to the Soviets be
tween 1974 and 1983.
Walker said problems with his wife, Barbara,
including her alcoholism, possible infidelity and
complaints about economic hardships, led him to
the decision to start selling secret documents to
the Soviets in 1968, when he was a Navy
radioman.
"She never felt there was enough money for

her to operate with," Walker said.
Sometime later that year, Walker said, his wife
broke the lock on his desk with a screwdriver and
found a message from his Soviet contacts on a
planned dropoff of classified material.
He said she called him a spy and a traitor.
Mrs. Walker later divorced her husband and
eventually was the one who turned him in to
authorities in late 1984. She is scheduled to tes
tify against Whitworth under a grant of immunity
from prosecution.
Donut shop holed up
LOS ANGELES — A donut shop owner, in
furiated at repeated holdups, shot and critically
wounded a bandit who tried to rob him for the
seventh time in two weeks, police said yesterday.
Police are not seeking charges against store
owner Sim Tan Tah, 37, who was acting in self
defense when he shot the robber Sunday,
Detective Carl Thompson said.
Ronald Ledet, 25, was in critical condition yes
terday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with gun
shot wounds, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.

Police said the bandit walked into the Western
Donut shop in Koreatown, drew back his jacket
to reveal a pistol tucked in his pants and said,
"Do you want to die?"
Tah, who came to this country from Cambodia
10 years ago, first handed over money from the
cash register, police said. Then he pulled out a
.38-caliber pistol he had bought the day before
and fired the gun's five rounds.
Ledet was hit four times, once in the face, said
Sgt. Tony Kulik.
Tah then took the alleged robber's own gun
and shot him once more, he said.
"He simply had had enough," Kulik said. "He
knew the man as soon as he walked in the door,"
Kulik said. "This guy was stretching his luck
coming here seven times. This time his luck ran
out."
