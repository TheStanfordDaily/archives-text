# Goodby wants to build confidence

"I'm fairly confident (that) one
way or another we'll come up with an
agreement" in the current Stockholm
Conference on Disarmament, Am
bassador James Goodby told a small
audience last night at History Corner.
Goodby, chief U.S. delegate to the
Conference on Disarmament in
Europe, outlined "a form of arms
control that has not been tried
before, . . confidence building
measures."
Also called risk reduction factors,
these measures are policies designed
to prevent accidents or misun
derstandings from escalating into
major conflicts that could result in
nuclear war.
The policies consist primarily of
"advance notice of missile launches,
submarines leaving port" and large
troop movements. Advance notice of
military activity would prevent mis
calculation in Europe, according to
Goodby.
Goodby also proposed establishing
"crisis centers" in Moscow and
Washington which during crises
would provide "a way of exchanging
rather technical information
quickly." This exchange would

reduce the chances of escalation,
Goodby said.
"Essentially we're trying to find a
way to improve intelligence," he said.
Were European nations to agree
upon such advance measures, a
"Soviet violation . . . would allow
NATO to take the kind of action" re
quired to counter a military threat,
Goodby said.
The policies are therefore "a bit
more self-enforcing than traditional
arms control," he said.
The "usual arms control approach
is arms reductions . . . affecting the
level of threat," Goodby said.
But it is "not enough to lower (the)
level" of arms because levels are
already so high, he said.
Therefore, "risk reduction as a
complement to arms control" must be
pursued, according to Goodby.
In Europe, neutral countries have
"lined up with NATO on this issue,"
Goodby said.
"We are dealing with some pretty
hard boiled countries. . . . Switzer
land is a country as tough as any
country in NATO," and the Swiss are
looking at the conference "as a way of
improving their security," he added.

Ambassador James Goodby spoke in History Corner last night, advo
cating "confidence building" as a new measure of arms control. Goodby
is the chief delegate to the Conference on Disarmament in Stockholm,
Sweden.
One reason that "risk reduction measures
haven't received the attention they deserve" in
the United States is that there "isn't any politi
cal pressure on Washington" to pursue such
policies, Goodby said. "They're not a real poli
tical issue here."
The Stockholm talks "haven't become
politicized," and the President of the United
States "can take a more objective look, and do
the right thing," according to Goodby.
"Reagan has spoken of it very positively," he
said.

But Goodby also lamented the lack of re
sources devoted to these negotiations.
"If you go below the (Presidential) level you
can't find anybody spending any time on it,"he
said.
"I think we have to pursue this more
vigorously in the future," he added.
Despite this lack of resources, Goodby said
the outlook for the current negotiations, sched
uled to end in September, "is brighter than in
other negotiations."
Regarding the possible impact of the recent
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant on cur
rent or future negotiations with the Soviet Un
ion, Goodby said, "I don't think Chernobyl will
make that much of a difference."
