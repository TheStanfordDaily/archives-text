# Davies to sue History Dept.
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Visiting History Prof. Norman
Davies last Monday filed suit against
members of Stanford's History De
partment as a result of a faculty deci
sion to deny him a permanent ap
pointment.
Davies, a leading expert on the his
tory of Poland and the director of
Stanford's new overseas program in
Krakow, was denied a tenured posi
tion in January by a 12-11
departmental vote, despite a vacant
professorship in East European
studies.
A source within the department
who wished not to be identified said
that Davies' lawsuit implicates the
department in general and History
Prof. Harold Kahn in particular, and
it charges that the department has
"conspired" to deny him an appoint
ment.
Former Democratic Congressman
Pete McCloskey said last night that
he will serve as Davies' sole attorney.
He would not confirm rumors that he
will be representing Davies without
charging a fee.
Davies is out of town and could not
be reached for comment yesterday.
Kahn last night refused to com
ment.on Davies' suit or reveal further
details. Instead he read the following
prepared statement:
"It is difficult to respond
coherently to a charge which seems so
inscrutable. While I understand Prof.
Davies' disappointment at not being
recommended for appointment to the
History Department faculty, I cannot
even remotely imagine why he sin
gled me out in the suit he filed against
me and 30 other unnamed people,
unless it is merely because he is
legally required to name at least one
person and has no basis to accuse
anyone in particular.
"There is no substance to the
charges he makes against me or, as
far as I know, against anyone else. It
is profoundly disturbing to see the le
gal process used in a way that could

tend to intimidate scholars and
prevent them from exercising their
professional judgment; certainly
that does not augur well for our own
academic freedom."
History Prof. Alexander Dallin ac
knowledged that Davies was planning
to sue and that written particulars of
the case had been distributed to
departmental faculty, but declined to
comment further.
"It's a legal matter, and there is a
general agreement that we shouldn't
comment," Dallin said.

The department's refusal to offer
Davies a professorship had shocked
some faculty members, one of whom
suggested in February that the
"department is waiting for Jesus
Christ" to fill the vacant position.
Davies, who obtained his doctorate
from the Jagiellonian University in
Krakow, is one of the few people in
the free world to earn a degree from
an Eastern bloc university. His book,
"Heart of Europe: A short history of
Poland," made The New York Times
Book Review in the history category
for 1985, where it was described as
"not only the best book on Poland in
the English language; it is the book
on Poland."
