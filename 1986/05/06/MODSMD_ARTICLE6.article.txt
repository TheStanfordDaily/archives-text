# GLAS launches awareness week

### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
This morning some students will
think twice before pulling on their
pants.
Today is "Gay Blue Jeans Day,"
one of the most visible and controver
sial parts of GALA Week, and pro
gram organizers from the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS)
hope community members will think
about what it means to be gay at
Stanford when they see others
wearing the denim pants or,
preferably, when they wear the jeans
themselves.
The eight-day, 19-event Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Week program is
directed at outreach, education and
celebration.
"Our aim is to educate everyone
about the many contributions gay
men and lesbians are making to soci
ety," said Atticus Tysen, GALA
Week coordinator.
"We hope to reach out to the entire
Peninsula community, not just to
Stanford people and not just to gay
people," he said.
The week's events include literary
and historical presentations, exhibits,
a film, a dance and a major benefit
for AIDS charities at the home of
University President Donald Ken
nedy.
Organizers say it is the largest and
most diverse celebration of its kind
on the West Coast.
"The best and most effective way
to overcome prejudices is to see and
learn about things," said Tysen, a
junior.
"We want to let people know who

we are. . . . There's a great variety in
the gay community. There's not just
one type of gay person."
For freshman Joyce Adams, organ
izer of an afternoon picnic on Wilbur
field held last weekend, the week is a
chance to offer a political statement
and to feel pride.
"It's time to say we're proud,"
Adams said, noting that "a lot of non
gay people don't know we're
around."
This year marks the 12th annual
Gay Pride celebration on campus.
Adams invited gay and lesbian
groups from other local universities
to join GLAS members and friends at
the picnic. The event was darkened
by many large clouds and a few Wil
bur resident hecklers.
Sometimes it's difficult for gays and
lesbians to tell their friends, class
mates and co-workers that they're
gay, according to Adams.
"A lot of people aren't cool," she
said.
Roommates, parents and friends of
gays and lesbians will meet at Bran
ner Lounge today at 4 p.m. to discuss
their experiences with the gay and
lesbian community.
The week climaxes Saturday with
the "Stanford Cares" benefit at the
Lou Henry Hoover House, the
theater production of "Unfinished
Business" at Memorial Auditorium
and a dance on the shores of Lake
Lagunita.
GLAS members have been
working long hours in preparation for
GALA Week.
"Sometimes we have to stop our
selves" from the work and remember
"it's time to have fun," Adams said.
