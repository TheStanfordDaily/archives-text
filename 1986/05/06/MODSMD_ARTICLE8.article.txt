# Oil prices affect students
## 
### KEVIN MONTAGUE Staff writer 
Because of the recent glut in the world oil
market, the price of oil imported by the
United States has dropped dramatically.
One consequence has been the recent
decline in gasoline prices. Another conse
quence, which is not so favorable, has been
felt recently by Stanford students: the sud
den termination of summer employment
programs.
Three Stanford students who thought they
were assured of summer positions with oil
companies were recently notified that these
companies had cut their summer employ
ment programs.
Jay Demski, Byron Jackson and Thomas
Henley, all juniors in petroleum engineer
ing, have been let go by their respective
summer employers.
UnoCal (Union Oil of California) last
month reneged on its job offer to Demski,
who had accepted a job with the company in
December.
"They sent me a letter," Demski said.
"They included a little compensation . .. but
it's kind of serious."
Because one of Stanford's requirements

for a bachelor's degree in petroleum engi
neering is a summer internship with a
suitable company, Demski would have had a
major problem if he had not subsequently
acquired a job with Bechtel Petroleum.
Henley, whose job with Mobil was also
rescinded recently, agreed.
"I got a phone call," Henley said. "They
just said that they're letting a lot of people
go in the industry and they said it would be
inconsistent to keep the summer
employees."
According to Dr. A.J. Home, professor of
petroleum engineering here, the summer
layoffs of college students are simply a
symptom of a much larger problem.
"The summer programs are a very, very
minor part of the whole thing," Home said.
"I feel very bad when you can't give our stu
dents a summer job, but when whole
families are suffering . . . you've got to look
at the whole picture."
The world oil glut, combined with the cur
rent state of national supply-and-demand
and current economic practices, helped
create the crisis in the industry, Home ex
plained.
"This (guy) in the White House can't ap

ply to oil," Home said. "Oil is depletable.
When you burn oil, that's it. It's not like
steel. ... If you cut the budget, you don't
need petroleum engineers and scientists.
You can't afford to spend millions and bil
lions to find oil."
Only five wells out of 100 find oil, accord
ing to Home, so that it becomes economi
cally unfeasible to search for it domestically
when it can be bought on the international
market so cheaply. "In good business, why
would you drill for oil when you can buy it?
.... Not that I think that's good, but that's
just simple Econ. 1.
"This is the sixth time in my career that
we've been through a glut," Home said
"This is the first time it's hit us at the inter
national level. ... Other times, it was na
tional supply-and-demand."
Although the industry crisis has caused
some problems and forced many students to
reassess their summer plans and career
goals, the general reaction to the situation
among students was not one of bitterness.
"I wouldn't not consider working for Un
oCal," Demski said. "I guess I can under
stand their situation, but I wish I didn't have
to be a victim of it."
