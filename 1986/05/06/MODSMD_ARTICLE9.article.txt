Elections
So ya think ya want to be editor. ..
All candidates for Volume 190 of The Stan
ford Daily must submit a formal declaration of
candidacy to Beth by Friday noon.
And let the race begin.
Daily Terror
And let the games begin, too.

Do you remember The Daily Terror? Sunny
spring afternoons next to El Camino? New
records for low batting averages and glaring er
rors? Did you know the Terror has never won a
game in IM match? We did beat the Profes

Well, The Daily Terror will rise from the
ashes this Sunday. Flavio will not be responsible
for bringing the equipment. Who ever said jour
nalists can't be athletes?
Details of the game will be available later this
week.
But we do know it'll be a rematch with the
PJFs,
