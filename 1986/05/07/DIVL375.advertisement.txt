INVITATION TO INNOVATION
The Program Board of SWOPSI has reviewed the staffing pattern
in the I.A.C. office and has recommended that student involvement be
increased by the hiring of two Student-Directors, preferably one
Undergraduate or Co-terminal and one Graduate Student. Applications
are hereby invited for both positions, which have been authorized by
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies on a trial basis as salaried half-time
positions (20 hours per week, $8685-00 for 10 months) from Sept. 1,
1986 to June 30, 1987. There is a possibility of tailoring the jobs to
meet the individual requirements of the successful candidates.
The primary responsibility of each Student-Director will be to
promote student participation — as teachers and as takers of courses
— in the program. The Undergraduate Student-Director will be
responsible for representing the interests of undergraduates as active
initiators of courses, speaking to residential and other groups about
the program, and expanding the range of collaborative and innovative
learning opportunities at Stanford. The Graduate Student-Director will
similarly work to increase the participation of graduate students from
all departments as teachers of lAC courses. In addition to outreach
activities, the Student-Directors will share the work of interviewing
prospective instructors, developing courses, managing the day-to-day
business of course support, and will attend the meetings of the
Accreditation Committee and the Program Board.
Undergraduates, Co-terminals and Graduate Students who are
interested in social-political issues and in promoting high quality
innovative education at Stanford are encouraged to come by the lAC
office (Old Union 590-A, 723-4305) to pick up an application form.
Completed applications are due Monday, May 19, 1986.
