# University disbands Delta Upsilon
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
The University yesterday revoked Delta Upsilon's
recognition and terminated the fraternity's housing
privileges.
In a letter to DU President Scott Hartman, Norm
Robinson, associate dean of Student Affairs, wrote
that the University based its decision on the DUs'
"lengthy history" of destructive and anti-social be
havior.
According to a report prepared for Robinson by
two Residential Education officials, the DUs are
"the antithesis" of what the University expects
from "responsible student groups."
The report, co-authored by Diana Conklin, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs and director of the
Row, and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano,
stated that the DUs should not "enjoy the privilege
(of University housing) any longer."
As a result of the decision, the DUs cannot meet
on campus as a fraternity or use the University's
name in any way.
In addition to unhousing the fraternity, no DU
can live in the house, located at 553 Mayfield, for
the duration of the group's suspension from
housing.
The date the DUs must move out of the house
has not been established, Robinson wrote in the

letter. However, the University reserves the right
to terminate the residency of any or all members of
the fraternity prior to the end of spring quarter.
Until the DUs move out, the Row Facilities Of
fice will begin weekly inspections of house to
ensure the fraternity is "keeping it clean," Conklin
said. She added that the DUs will be held ac
countable for any house debts incurred.
The University disbanded and unhoused the
DUs to halt the "persistent and unacceptable" be
havior of the fraternity, according to Conklin.
Since the DUs continually failed to demonstrate
responsible self-government despite numerous op
portunities to do so, the University concluded that
change at the DU house was impossible, she said.
"Time just ran out" on the DUs to improve their
behavior, Conklin said. She added that the behav
ior of the fraternity during their suspension would
determine if the DUs would regain University
recognition.
By revoking DU recognition, the University also
wished to strengthen the fraternity system by
removing a "group that has brought the system
shame and disfavor in the community," Conklin
and Pisano wrote.
The decision came two weeks after the Inter
fraternity Council (IFC) revoked DU recognition,
and three weeks after the University banned all
Rush and other social activities at the fraternity.

Although the DUs are currently appealing the
IFC decision, Pisano said the University made its
decision now because it had the information it
needed to "act with confidence."
The University revoked recognition of the DUs
for two years. After that period, the fraternity may
petition to regain University recognition under
probationary status for six months. The two bodies
would decide at the end of the six months whether
to end or extend the probation or revoke recogni
tion.
If the probation is lifted, the DUs would have to
perform one year's cycle of Rush, pledging and in
itiation without any anti-social or destructive inci
dents before the fraternity could petition to regain
housing.
The University's decision culminates a series of
recent incidents involving the DUs.
At a April 10 Rush party, DU members served
alcohol to freshman rushees past the 10:30 p.m.
curfew designated by the IFC. After the incident,
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons said serving al
cohol past hours could be grounds for revoking fra
ternity recognition.
Two days later, two members of the fraternity
dragged a couch to the third-floor balcony. Despite
instructions from Hartman to stop, one of the two
lit the couch on fire and threw it off
the balcony.
On the same night as the couch in
cident, several DUs went to another
fraternity and caused damage to the
house, Conklin and Pisano wrote in
their report.
They added that there exists
"growing evidence" that members of

the DUs have been involved in
several other incidents, including at
least one in which members of the
IFC board were ridiculed and threat
ened with physical violence.
The DUs can appeal the Univer
sity's decision to the dean of Student
Affairs, and Lyons said the Univer
sity's response would depend on the
basis of the appeal.
If an appeal is warranted, Lyons
said he, in consultation with the DUs,
would decide how the charges would
be heard.
Hartman, calling the University's
decision unjustified, said it was unfair
for the University to hold the unac
ceptable behavior of past fraternity
members against the current DUs.
Hartman also said the timing of the
University decision revealed an
"utter disregard" for the appeals
process of the IFC.
Despite the decision, the DUs plan
to remain together. "We intend to
keep the fraternity going," Hartman
said.
The DUs will pledge a new class of
members this year, Hartman said.
According to Rodger Whitney, as
sistant dean of Residential Education
and director of the Housing Office,
the DU house will become a
University-operated co-ed Row
House. The house will be filled with
students on the waiting list after
Round II of the housing Draw, he
said.

Until the DUs move out, the Row Facilities Of
fice will begin weekly inspections of house to
ensure the fraternity is "keeping it clean," Conklin
said. She added that the DUs will be held ac
countable for any house debts incurred.
The University disbanded and unhoused the
DUs to halt the "persistent and unacceptable" be
havior of the fraternity, according to Conklin.
Since the DUs continually failed to demonstrate
responsible self-government despite numerous op
portunities to do so, the University concluded that
change at the DU house was impossible, she said.
"Time just ran out" on the DUs to improve their
behavior, Conklin said. She added that the behav
ior of the fraternity during their suspension would
determine if the DUs would regain University
recognition.
By revoking DU recognition, the University also
wished to strengthen the fraternity system by
removing a "group that has brought the system
shame and disfavor in the community," Conklin
and Pisano wrote.
The decision came two weeks after the Inter
fraternity Council (IFC) revoked DU recognition,
and three weeks after the University banned all
Rush and other social activities at the fraternity.

Although the DUs are currently appealing the
IFC decision, Pisano said the University made its
decision now because it had the information it
needed to "act with confidence."
The University revoked recognition of the DUs
for two years. After that period, the fraternity may
petition to regain University recognition under
probationary status for six months. The two bodies
would decide at the end of the six months whether
to end or extend the probation or revoke recogni
tion.
If the probation is lifted, the DUs would have to
perform one year's cycle of Rush, pledging and in
itiation without any anti-social or destructive inci
dents before the fraternity could petition to regain
housing.
The University's decision culminates a series of
recent incidents involving the DUs.
At a April 10 Rush party, DU members served
alcohol to freshman rushees past the 10:30 p.m.
curfew designated by the IFC. After the incident,
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons said serving al
cohol past hours could be grounds for revoking fra
ternity recognition.
Two days later, two members of the fraternity
dragged a couch to the third-floor balcony. Despite
instructions from Hartman to stop, one of the two
lit the couch on fire and threw it off
the balcony.
On the same night as the couch in
cident, several DUs went to another
fraternity and caused damage to the
house, Conklin and Pisano wrote in
their report.
They added that there exists
"growing evidence" that members of

the DUs have been involved in
several other incidents, including at
least one in which members of the
IFC board were ridiculed and threat
ened with physical violence.
The DUs can appeal the Univer
sity's decision to the dean of Student
Affairs, and Lyons said the Univer
sity's response would depend on the
basis of the appeal.
If an appeal is warranted, Lyons
said he, in consultation with the DUs,
would decide how the charges would
be heard.
Hartman, calling the University's
decision unjustified, said it was unfair
for the University to hold the unac
ceptable behavior of past fraternity
members against the current DUs.
Hartman also said the timing of the
University decision revealed an
"utter disregard" for the appeals
process of the IFC.
Despite the decision, the DUs plan
to remain together. "We intend to
keep the fraternity going," Hartman
said.
The DUs will pledge a new class of
members this year, Hartman said.
According to Rodger Whitney, as
sistant dean of Residential Education
and director of the Housing Office,
the DU house will become a
University-operated co-ed Row
House. The house will be filled with
students on the waiting list after
Round II of the housing Draw, he
said.
The University yesterday revoked Delta Upsilon's
recognition and terminated the fraternity's housing
privileges.
In a letter to DU President Scott Hartman, Norm
Robinson, associate dean of Student Affairs, wrote
that the University based its decision on the DUs'
"lengthy history" of destructive and anti-social be
havior.
According to a report prepared for Robinson by
two Residential Education officials, the DUs are
"the antithesis" of what the University expects
from "responsible student groups."
The report, co-authored by Diana Conklin, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs and director of the
Row, and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano,
stated that the DUs should not "enjoy the privilege
(of University housing) any longer."
As a result of the decision, the DUs cannot meet
on campus as a fraternity or use the University's
name in any way.
In addition to unhousing the fraternity, no DU
can live in the house, located at 553 Mayfield, for
the duration of the group's suspension from
housing.
The date the DUs must move out of the house
has not been established, Robinson wrote in the

letter. However, the University reserves the right
to terminate the residency of any or all members of
the fraternity prior to the end of spring quarter.
