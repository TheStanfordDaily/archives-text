# Final report on cheating out
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
After investigating charges of cheating in Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's Psychology I class last spring, the
University's judicial affairs officer has recommended
that "students who study together should take care not
to sit near each other during examinations" to avoid
being falsely accused of cheating.
In her final report on the incident, Sally Cole also
said that although several students have suggested that
Zimbardo should have met with the students suspected
of cheating before initiating the judicial process, such
incidents should be handled by the Judicial Affairs Of
fice because the process is "very time-consuming .. .
alien, even unpleasant, to many instructors."
The report, which was released yesterday, followed
an 80-hour investigation in which a dozen students
were found guilty of Honor Code violations. In
December, nine students were suspended for three
quarters, three received shorter suspensions and all
were denied credit for the course. In addition, one stu
dent's undergraduate degree was withdrawn.
Zimbardo's spring 1985 class had an enrollment of
744 — approximately 10 percent of the undergraduate
population.
The students found guilty of cheating were taking

the course "expecting easy As* (based upon reports
about the course in prior years) and encountered in
stead a changed curriculum and a difficult, time
consuming course." Cole wrote in the report. "Instead
of dropping the course and knuckling down, they
began to cheat.
"The students were not evil people, but their
temptation thresholds were low — unacceptably low —
and they repeatedly made stupid, lazy choices."
In the report, Cole concluded that "the sense of
anonymity that can arise in a large class increases the
likelihood that students will cheat.
"Prof. Zimbardo has vowed never again to teach so
large a class, and his Psych 1 class winter quarter had a
limited enrollment of about 300 students," Cole wrote.
Other changes included altering the format and quan
tity of tests, moving to a different classroom, and
raising the educational qualifications for the teaching
assistants.
Zimbardo reported that "the course was not better
as a result of these changes — quite the contrary, in his
view — but there was, apparently, no cheating," Cole
wrote.
Neither Cole nor Zimbardo could he reached for
comment yesterday.
In the report, Cole said the incident does not
jeopardize the Honor Code.
