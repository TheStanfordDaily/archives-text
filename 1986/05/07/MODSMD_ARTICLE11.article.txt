						warning to the frats 
### 
There is a section of Stanford's "Terms and Condi
tions of Fraternity Occupancy" which reads:
"Fraternities . . . shall refrain from violations of law,
acts of violence against persons or property, distur
bances of the peace, activities which endanger persons
or property, or any other acts which are unreasonable
in the University's academic and residential environ
ment."
Anyone familiar with the recent history of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity will have no trouble thinking of a
house to which those regulations can be applied. The
DUs, more than any other currently housed fraternity,
have unabashedly flaunted the University's written
standards of behavior, and have done so for several
years now.
Residential Education's decision yesterday to
revoke the DU's housing privilege and University
recognition, on the basis of the DUs' long record of
wrongdoing, was a necessary step. We applaud the ac
tion, and we hope that the DU case will serve as acon
stnictive warning to the rest of the fraternity system.

In many ways, the DUs' departure could have a pos
itive effect on Stanford's other housed fraternities. The
source of many of the fraternity incidents on campus
has been stopped up, and the image the rest of the sys
tem projects to the world should improve.
More importantly. Res Ed's decision should put the
fear of God into the rest of Stanford's housed fraterni
ties, and they should work even harder to stay within
the University's behavioral guidelines. Already, the
previously impotent Interfraternity Council has begun
to exercise greater control over the system. The IFC's
decision last week to revoke DU recognition was the
strongest action of its entire history; hopefully, it will
now take over even more control of fraternity behav
ior.
Res Ed's decision is good for the University commu
nity, for the fraternity system and even for the DUs,
who now face the real challenge of reforming their fra
ternity within the next two years, when they can peti
tion for reinstatement. The DUs' removal is a con
structive, not destructive, step.
