# A 						career in uniform can't be beat
## 
### 
With the arrival of spring, many graduating
seniors are faced with the inevitable prospect of
choosing a career. Typical options can range from
capitalism in the corporate ranks to teaching Third
World peoples to cook as a Peace Corps volunteer.
The indecisive can always return to graduate school
to buy more time. There is another option that no
Stanford counselor or professor would dare sug
gest: become a commissioned officer in the armed
forces.
Few civilian corporations can offer the same
"trial-by-fire" leadership experience afforded a
junior officer in the military. Whether the reason is
attributable to the lack of a profit motive or the

need to .develop people who can operate-in diverse
situations, the military trusts its junior officers
with inordinate responsibility for people, equip
ment and solving problems. Mistakes are frequent,
but are expected to be learning experiences.
A typical lieutenant just out of college is given a
platoon with direct responsibility for 30 people. A
captain with four years experience commands a
company with over 100 people and millions of dol
lars in equipment, living facilities, dining halls,
motor parks and maintenance facilities. While reg
ulations exist governing every aspect of military
life, there is plenty of room for innovation and
flexibility. Since resources are limited, imagination
and ingenuity are often the key to success.
Those desiring to affect the lives of others should
also consider the military. Since the military reg
ulates and monitors every aspect of a soldier's life,
an officer often becomes deeply involved in the

personal affairs of subordinates. Counseling ses
sions range from drugs and homosexuality to family
problems and financial debt. Many soldiers have
little education, come from disadvantaged families
or have to provide guidance, leadership and train
ing to individuals who might not receive it
anywhere else. Why not perform a public service in
an organization that is adequately funded, highly
structured and offers the resources and authority to
profoundly influence the lives of others?
For those who yearn for graduate school, join the
military and let them foot the bill. The media image
that the military mind is rigid, inflexible and anti
quated has never been farther from the truth. With
advanced equipment and an automated battlefield,
the military has placed an ever increasing emphasis
on education. High school diplomas are required
for promotion in the enlisted ranks, and almost all
officers have bachelor's degrees. Most will attain a
master's degree sometime in their career. Es
timates conclude that officers spend more than a
quarter of their career in some type of school.
The military is a young person's career. Rarely
will anybody be allowed to remain after 30 years
service. Heavy emphasis is placed on physical fit
ness and personal appearance. As a result, partici
pation in sports programs and physical conditioning
are integral parts of the job. A lot of time is spent
outdoors, often in a field environment.
Military life is a gypsy existence. You can expect
to stay in one location no longer than three years,
and in a single job for only a year-and-a-half. If you
encounter an unreasonable boss, you are at least
guaranteed that one of you will be leaving soon.
Since over 30 percent of the military is overseas at
any given time, an officer can expect assignments in
a foreign country, typically Korea, Germany or
Italy. Military life may be taxing and difficult, but it
is certainly never boring.
People come and go at an alarming rate in the
armed forces. You tend to make friends quickly be
cause everyone is in a transient status. Newcomers
are expected and welcomed immediately. It is al
ways sad to bid farewell, but reunions are constant.
With a finite number of military posts and frequent

reassignments, friends are invariably waiting at
your next location.
Military pay is by no means lavish but is certainly
reasonable. When advantages such as commissary,
non-taxable housing allowance, medical benefits,
etc. are computed, it is comparable to equivalent
civilian pay. The non-contributory retirement plan
that allows a soldier to retire with half pay after 20
years of service is not matched in the civilian world.
Since military duties can be physically and mentally
demanding, everyone receives 30 days paid vaca
tion per year regardless of time in the organization.
The military has a long history of pride, esprit de
corps and tradition. Parades, salutes, decorations,
insignia of rank and a complex jargon of acronyms
are symbols of this unique profession. Honor and
integrity are sacred. There is an inherent satisfac
tion in serving and defending your country. Even in
an entry level position, you feel that your contribu
tion is worthwhile and important. I am not sure that
selling soap to hotel chains or balancing the books
for a soda pop manufacturer provides the same
feeling.
The military has led the way in equal opportu
nity. Currently black soldiers comprise 30 percent
of the U.S. Army, a much larger percentage than
the population at large. Northwestern University
sociologist Charles Moskos recently stated that
"blacks have achieved more positions of leadership
in the armed forces than in any part of our society."
Admittedly, the military is not for everybody.
The formality and discipline can be imposing. Total
freedom of expression is often stifled. You will
never see a shantytown on the parade field or a
troop barracks declared a refugee sanctuary. The
job may someday require the ultimate sacrifice â€”
giving your life for your country. Nevertheless, the
military is filled with diligent, hard-working sol
diers, sailors and airmen who need qualified and
dedicated leaders. The military provides avast op
portunity that cannot be found anywhere else.
Take a look, you might like it. Be all you can be.
