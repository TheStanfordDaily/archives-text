## Have faith in the democratic process

There she goes again. In her most recent column
(Daily, May 2), Nancy Latham continues to amuse
the informed reader by abounding in naive, unreal
istic, pseudo-intellectual, destructively critical and
sensational rhetoric. The subject is different —
U.S. foreign policy toward Nicaragua, but the
players are the same. President Reagan and our
government are the bad guys; everyone else either
their victims or the good guys. This time the Sandi
nistas join the list of Latham's tragic heroes, two of
whom not too surprisingly include Palestinian
Liberation Organization leader Yasir Arafat and
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Khadafy.
She accuses our government of attempting to
deceive the U.S. public with misleading
propaganda in the debate over contra aid and
argues that our readers have forgotten about the
"legitimacy" of the Sandinista government and the
popular "mandate" which they purport to control.
Our leaders and the majority of the U.S. public
have not overlooked this fact precisely because, in

its current state, the Sandinista government is an
outlaw regime with no legitimate right to its abso
lute control over the Nicaraguan people.
In defending this thesis, a brief review of the
facts is necessary. In 1979 Sandinista rebels led the
popular overthrow of President Anastasio
Somoza's right-wing dictatorship. The Sandinistas
comprised only half of the revolutionary forces.
The rest consisted of various other non-Marxist
Nicaraguans, including many Catholics and
Mesquito Indians, who had simply had enough of
the corrupt Somoza. However, in the immediate af
termath of the revolution, the Sandinistas brutally
and ruthlessly consolidated their power. They
reneged on their promise to share power with the
other non-Sandinista leader* of the revolution and
did not hold elections until five years later. By that
time, their "mandate" was secure. They had
deceptively gained the favor of many poor, naive
peasants who had been so ruthlessly treated by
Somoza.
Understand, I am not opposing the concept of
government by representative majority rule.
Indeed, our own government was founded on this

very notion. However, there are measures in the
Constitution, most importantly the Bill of Rights,
which provide for the problem of tyranny of the
majority. I condemn only majority rule procured
through undemocratic, manipulative means. It's no
wonder many Nicaraguans were attracted to
the Sandinista's Marxist ideology when
"democracy and capitalism" (as defined by
Somoza) let them down so tragically. While health
care and literacy have improved dramatically since
the revolution, what are the people supposed to
think when the first newspaper they are handed
espouses pro-Sandinista, anti-contra, anti-
American propaganda?
Learning how to read liberates, but in a closed
and totalitarian society it ultimately enslaves. How
are the people suppose to view the United States
when for so long we supported their corrupt dic
tator Somoza? The true American ideals of liberty
and democracy have yet to make themselves
known to the people of Nicaragua. If the Sandinis
tas continue their totalitarian hold on the
Nicaraguan people, those ideals will never be a
reality in Nicaragua as they are in the United States
today.
Two wrongs don't make a right. Almost any gov
ernment established in post-revolutionary
Nicaragua would have been better than Somoza's,
but that does not justify the Sandinistas' absolute
control over Nicaragua, not to mention a military
arsenal greater than that of all other Central Amer
ican nations combined. While we, as Americans,
believe in self-determination and nationalism —
after all that is our own heritage — we believe in a
self-determination that is democratic and a
nationalism which is self-contained and not expan
sionist.
Latham's Sandinista "mandate" is comparable to
the Nazi Party's control over Germany 50 years
ago. Does such a mandate justify the diabolical
means by which it was illegitimately secured? Make
no bones about it, Nicaragua today, much like Hit
ler's Germany, Castro's Cuba and Gorbachev's
Russia, is ruled by a ruthless, expansionist
totalitarian oligarchy which suppresses all means of
open expression, including the freedoms of political
belief and religion.
But my quarrel with Latham goes much deeper.
She asserts that our government deceives us with

propaganda, that truth and reality are nowhere to
be found in our nation's capitol. Such a pessimistic,
unpatriotic attitude which "badmouths" the United
States is not constructively critical. No, our govern
ment is not perfect; it is "of, for and by the
people," and people unfortunately make mistakes.
I deplore the deception involved in incidents like
that in the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam or the
Watergate cover-up. Yet, one cannot lose faith in
our government because of a few dishonorable
mistakes.
If one refuses to accept the integrity of the exec
utive branch, at least accept the leadership of the
Congress. After all, our Congress does, in theory at
least, represent the will of the people. Moreover,
our senators and representatives are much more
privy to the facts than are we. While we must be
cautious of our leaders' actions and motives, we
must, nonetheless, have faith in their wisdom, skill
and prudence. Constructive criticism is what keeps
our leaders on their toes; it is Latham's pessimistic
and destructive criticism that I deplore.
The recent legislation to send aid to the contras
passed in the Senate and failed in the House by
only 12 votes. Such a demonstration of confidence
in the president's foreign policy lends some
credibility to the argument against the Sandinistas
and questions the legitimacy of their government.
The proposal to send aid to the contras is contro
versial, but it is not so because the Sandinista
regime is legitimate, fair or acceptable in nature.
The controversy concerns the more realistic debate
as to what President Reagan's real objectives are.
and what is the most appropriate and effective
means of persuading the Sandinistas to reform.
Whether or not the Congress approves the aid
package is irrelevant to the point I am making. I
may not agree with the Congress' decision, but I
will accept it within the framework of our free and
fair democratic process, something unheard of in
Nicaragua today. The issue will have been debated
completely, rationally, intellectually and realisti
cally — qualities noticeably absent from Latham's
reasoning. It is unfortunate that the people of
Nicaragua cannot enjoy the freedoms of expression
shared by Latham, myself and all citizens of this
great nation.
