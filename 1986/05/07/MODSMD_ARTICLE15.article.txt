Fight homophobia
This week, May 3 -11, is the annual
Gay and Lesbian Awareness
(GALA) Week celebration at Stan
ford. GALA Week is the result of the
work of a group of Stanford students
who share a common goal: increasing
public awareness and understanding
gays and their lifestyles. Moreover,
GALA Week is the one week where
the entire Stanford community, het
erosexual as well as homosexual,
joins together to demonstrate support
for gays and lesbians.
An incident on Sunday at Rin
conada, however, made me realize
that the goals of GALA Week might
be a bit unrealistic. At Sunday's
GALA Week picnic, an anonymous
Rinconada resident placed in his win
dow a message that was clearly visible
from Wilbur Field where the picnic
was being held. The message taped
onto the window read: "Hi Fags!"
Most likely, the message was a fresh
man homophobe's idea of a funny
joke that would convey his disgust
toward gay people. As it were, his
"joke" was nothing less than a dis
play of homophobic hostility and
ridicule.
This is not the only incident of
overt homophobia on this campus. In
fact, there is an almost endless list of
incidences of overt ridicule and hos
tility toward gay people at Stanford: a
gay couple, during a dorm party at a
Florence Moore residence last year,
danced together and were ridiculed
and even kicked by a male group of
dorm residents; a Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford representative
this year tried repeatedly to post
GL AS flyers in a campus gymnasium,
only to have them repeatedly
maligned and torn down by gym ad
ministrators; and finally, my personal
campaign materials in White Plaza
(for the ASSU Senate election) were
twice defaced by someone who wrote
phrases like "The Gay Choice" and

"Butt Pirate" over my name on the
banners.
For a homosexual, experiences like
these are commonplace. They are not
commonplace, however, for most
other minorities on this campus.
Overt racism and sexism are practi
cally absent in the Stanford student
body. One would never find on this
campus a picnic where black students
were greeted with a message like, "Hi
Niggers!" We are grateful that stu
dents no longer overtly display racist
or sexist sentiment. And we are
grateful that, should an incident of
racism occur, the University does not
tolerate such actions. But, when a dif
ferent minority is involved, namely,
gays and lesbians, the University and
students react differently. Most admi
nistrators and students, while simul
taneously supporting minority rights,
tolerate displays of ridicule and hos
tility toward gays. Gay students are a
minority just like black, Asian,
Hispanic and other minority students
on this campus. Yet gay students have
fewer rights than other minorities,
and when one of their few rights is
violated, it is tolerated.
With GALA Week upon us, and a
week's activities planned in celebra
tion of gay and lesbian awareness, let
us critically evaluate the "equality"
among minorities and their rights on
this campus. As students we must
realize that Stanford is a school with a
vast collection of minorities, all of
whom deserve support and respect by
the University community. Thank
fully, we have taken the first step:
overt racism against black minorities
is a rare occurrence on this campus.
The next step is to allow another
group of minorities, gays and les
bians, the same decent and respectful
behavior. From a world-class univer
sity like Stanford, and from its world
class students, one should expect
nothing less.
