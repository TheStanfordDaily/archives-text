# University follows selective policy

The University's ruling on the
Delta Upsilon fraternity does not
indicate a move toward dissolving
all fraternity housing at Stanford,
according to officials here.

News Analysis

Instead, the decision highlights
a long-standing University policy
of considering each fraternity indi
vidually â€” a policy aimed at
selectively divesting of only
troublesome fraternities.
Stanford's 12 housed fraterni

ties have drawn criticism in recent
years for several acts deemed il
legal, unethical or silly. Many op
ponents of the system also argue
that the fraternities promote
sexism and elitism, and some say it
is unfair that fraternity members
control access to some of the Uni
versity's best residences.
In May 1984, a special task
force recommended that the Uni
versity eliminate fraternity
housing within three years.
Yet it appears today that the
housed fraternity system as a
whole is in no real danger. The
University, maintaining its policy of
punishing fraternities individually
rather than collectively, is not likely
to shift its tack in the next few years,
with the possible exception of in
stituting a non-alcoholic Rush.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano says he is optimistic that
housed fraternities will "continue to
have a place at Stanford."
I think the University's policy is to
have good fraternities," he said. "It
makes more sense to me to (use) a
case-by-case basis . . . than to abolish
all fraternity housing."
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
Student Affairs, agrees that the Uni
versity should treat Stanford's housed
fraternities as individual groups.
Conklin Ls quick to rebuke certain
houses for repeated misdeeds, and
has gained an anti-fraternity reputa
tion for her vitriolic, well
documented letters to fraternity
presidents.
Yet she eagerly discusses the posi
tive programs of other fraternities,
noting that "those of us who work

with the fraternities know there are
many differences between them."
She lists the Delta Kappa Epsilon,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi
fraternities as groups that have, in
general, stayed out of trouble and en
couraged "events in the house from
which people learn."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he thinks housed fraterni
ties will have to play a positive role to
survive at Stanford in upcoming
years.
He predicts that Stanford will still
have housed fraternities in five years,
but says the system will be quite dif
ferent than it is today. Fraternities
will need to show "signs of health,"
he explains, citing a move toward
more faculty and alumni programs,
and service to the community.
"There's not that much interest in
single-sex housing anymore," he said,
calling fraternities a "residential
anachronism" and asserting that the
fraternity houses are "fighting a
losing battle" to attract pledges.
Lyons said he senses little support
for eliminating fraternity housing,
despite the recommendation of his
fraternity task force to do so.
In addition, Lyons notes that the

task force, two years after releasing
its preliminary recommendations, has
not yet submitted its final report.
"We still don't have their justification
for their recommendations," he said.
Conklin said she is relieved that the
DU investigation is finished because
she can now turn to other matters.
Those matters include the inves
tigations of two other fraternities,
both of which may also lose their
housing before next fall.
The Alpha Delta Phi fraternity is
charged with creating a "dangerous
environment" through alleged use,
abuse and sales of drugs. Conklin also
cited the reportedly high incidence of
"personal and academic crises"
among fraternity members there.
The Theta Delta Chi fraternity has
been warned that it appears to be on
a "fast downhill slide." Conklin cited
several behavioral incidents including
one involving freshmen in Branner
Hall.
The Theta Delts drew praise yes
terday from Conklin and Lyons, who
said the fraternity had heeded warn
ings and now showed signs of im
provement. "I am really hopeful that
they will be able to govern themselves
responsibly," Conklin said.
