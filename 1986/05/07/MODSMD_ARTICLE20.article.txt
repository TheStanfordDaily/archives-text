## Laffer tosses curve into Senate race 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
In 1973 Ed Zschau and Arthur
Laffer were both candidates pursuing
doctorates in economics at Stanford
University. In 1986 history repeats it
self: both are candidates again, but
this time they are pursuing the Re
publican nomination for U.S. Senate.
Laffer, known for his easy speaking
style and staunch support of
Reaganomics, is a dark horse in the

race to unseat Democratic incumbent
Alan Cranston, and many wonder if
he can raise enough financial support
to first defeat Zschau.
Laffer says he would like to debate
Zschau at Stanford, but Zschau has
declined earlier offers.
Laffer is most famous as the father
of President Reagan's "supply-side"
economic policy.
The Laffer Curve theory, which
was first introduced on a restaurant
napkin in 1974 and later became the
academic stimulus behind Reagan's
first tax cut proposal, states that a cut
in tax rates can actually increase tax
revenue.
While the curve is generally ac
cepted in theory, many economists

reject the idea that revenues can be
increased after an across-the-board
tax reduction — especially in the af
termath of record federal deficits,
which followed the Laffer-endorsed
tax cut.
Laffer, however, maintains that the
federal deficit is the result of un
restrained congressional spending.
A current member of Reagan's
Economic Policy Advisory Board,
Laffer maintains that many of the
problems the nation faces today can
be resolved through a system of fi
nancial incentives.
His solution to save the condor
from extinction, for example, is to tap
the resources of the business sector
by offering $50,000 for every condor
born in privately-run hatcheries.
Laffer's reward system applies to
foreign policy as well. His solution to
international terrorism is to offer a $2
million bounty for the capture and
extradition of those responsible for
terrorist acts abroad.
The educational system can be im
proved with merit pay for teachers,
Laffer said. He also proposes to boost
academic achievement by offering
$15,000 to high school students who
score in the top 5 percent on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test.
Through a variety of economic
mechanisms, including a reorganiza
tion of the tax codes and monetary
reform, Laffer plans to strengthen the
economy, thereby taking more
people off of the unemployment
rolls.

This increase in employment will in
turn generate more tax revenues.
"A 1 percent reduction of the un
employment rate saves the federal
government $40 billion per year,"
Laffer says.
This savings — along with the in
crease in tax revenues — is part of
Laffer's solution to trim the $2 tril
lion national debt.
To bring the $2 trillion national
debt under control Laffer favors a re
organization of the current tax code.
Laffer hopes to simplify the tax sys
tem by imposing a flat rate tax of 11.5

percent for both business and per
sonal income. This system would
generate as much revenue as the cur
rent one does, he says.
But if the deficit is to be brought
under control, these changes must be
accompanied by budget cuts, he
stresses.
While each dollar in government
spending does some good, each dollar
collected in tax revenues does some
harm, according to Laffer. In the past
Congress has only concerned itself
with the good that accompanies
spending.

Laffer says it is "time to examine
the other side of the coin" — the
harm associated with taxing the eco
nomy.
While Laffer has never held an
elected office, he says he probably
understands complex economics is
sues better than most of his rivals.
His credentials include teaching
economics at the University of
Chicago, USC and Pepperdine as well
as holding the position of chief econ
omist for the Nixon Administration's
budget office.
