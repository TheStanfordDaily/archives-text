## The 						Financial Aids Office deserves close look 
### KENNETH SAWYER Editorial staff 
The Office of Financial Aids is an ex
tremely important office at Stanford for about
4,110 undergraduates. These 4,110 collect a
large portion of the $36,552 million in gov
ernment and University financial aid funds.
The Financial Aids Office (FAO) puts that
figure at "over $40 million" in its pamphlet to
parents, but, surprisingly, a couple million
here or there doesn't make a big difference.
Stanford uses something called the
"uniform methodology" to help determine
how much money each family should pay.
This uniform methodology was endorsed by
the College Scholarship Service (CSS) As
sembly, of which Stanford is a member.
The uniform methodology was established
so that students at all schools have their finan
cial situation appraised equally and fairly.
Hence, every year, students applying for fi
nancial aid must fill out the Financial Aid
Form (FAF) before Stanford will make an
aids award.
Unfortunately, as with any uniform
method, many people feel that the aid distri
bution system is neither equal nor fair. In fact,
the CSS itself states that the methodology
"cannot make distinctions between the frugal
poor and the spendthrift. It cannot distinguish
between improvidence and hardship."
In other words, if your family is considering
using its savings for a vacation to Europe or
putting it in the bank to save for your educa
tion, it is to your family's advantage to take
the trip to Europe. Here's why:
The uniform methodology takes all of your
parents' cash, home equity, net business or
farm value, plus any investments and calls
that your family's income supplement. Every
family applying for financial aid must contrib
ute about 40 percent of 12 percent of its
income supplement to Stanford every year.

By spending money rather than saving it,
your family will pay less to Stanford and you
will get more financial aid. Essentially, Stan
ford or the U.S. government will subsidize a
portion of your trip.
But that is not all. Perhaps you have $3,000
saved in your checking account. It could be
that a relative gave you a nice high school
graduation present or maybe you worked at
McDonald's after school to earn the money.
The uniform methodology requires you to pay
35 percent of that money each year to pay for
your education. You'd have to pay $ 1,050 the
first year, $682 the second and $443 the third.
After three years of college you'd have spent
$2,176.
Now that doesn't seem so bad, unless you
consider what a wiser student might have
done. If he gave the $3,000 he earned to his
parents, then the family would be required to
give at most 47 percent of 12 percent of the
income supplement to Stanford. In other
words, $169 the first year, $160 the second
and $155 the third. After three years of col
lege you'd have spent $484; the University or
the government would have given you, or
loaned you, the rest.
Yet, there is one better thing you might do
with your $3,000: spend it. If you had pur
chased an automobile with that $3,000, you
would pay absolutely nothing to Stanford.
The uniform methodology does not consider
cars an asset. Now after three years at Stan
ford you have a car and grants or loans of
$2,176.
The uniform methodology has another
peculiar quirk. Before determining financial
aid, something called "available income" is
calculated. This is wages earned, alimony
received and accrued interest minus taxes
paid, medical expenses, an employment al
lowance and a "standard maintenance allow
ance." This standard maintenance allowance
is based on family size and is supposed to

reflect how much it costs to live for a family of
that size.
The funny thing is that the allowance
doesn't depend on where you live. It is
supposed to cost a family in Manhattan the
same amount to live as a family in Kansas. In
reality, the difference may be thousands of
dollars per person. The uniform methodology
ignores this.
Also, Stanford adheres to the uniform
methodology when determining how to split
parental contributions when there is more
than one child in college. Stanford just divides
the total contribution by the number of stu
dents, even if some of the children may be re
ceiving full scholarships — academic or ath
letic.

There are times, however, when Stanford
makes adjustments to the uniform method
ology. Roberta Johnson, associate director of
Financial Aids, said, "In general, the FAO
doesn't allow losses to reduce total income as
would the uniform methodology."
This means that if a business your family
owns loses a great deal of money in a particu
lar year, your parents may not have to pay
income taxes (the loss may offset any earned
income).
However, Stanford won't take that into
consideration. If your family's income
remains the same from the year before,
despite the fact that you lost, say, $50,000,
you must still pay the same amount of tuition.
Admittedly, it is very hard to determine
what is fair and what isn't. The FAO's task is

by no means an easy one. But unfortunately,
determining what is fair isn't the office's only
problem; it also has problems giving aid out.
John Erickson, the University bursar, told
me that in fall quarter of this year 3,580 stu
dents deferred because their financial aid
from Stanford wasn't ready or because their
government loans weren't in. This
represented more than $7 million. By winter
quarter those numbers had dropped to fewer
than 700 and less than $1.5 million, and by
spring quarter only 300 or so had still
deferred because of late Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSL).
Stanford lost more than $200,000 in inter
est and penalty fees because of deferred pay
ments in the fall alone. It cost every single un
dergraduate student approximately $33 extra
tuition in the fall because of the delays.
The reason this happens is that students,
while encouraged to apply for a GSL by June
30, are allowed to apply as late as Sept. 30
and still defer without penalty fees. Last year
fewer than 1,100 students had applied for
their GSL by Aug. 1. By March 29, more than
2,100 students had applied.
One senior said, "I've always tried to get
my forms in on time, but if I don't I know that
there is no big deal. My sophomore year I
turned my forms in by the end of August, but
I never got my GSL or my financial aid pack
age until the beginning of spring quarter. It
worked out great, though — I just deferred
my entire tuition for two quarters. My dad
sure was happy."
The staff at the FAO is hard-working. Most
of the nine professionals on the staff, accord
ing to Johnson, work well over 40 hours per
week. The office recently hired two new
people, and has implemented a new computer
system that has reportedly sped up the award
process from two to three months three years
ago, to two to three weeks currently. Still, the
financial aid process can always be improved.

Another senior said, "I've had to hassle
with financial aid ever since I've been here.
Every year it seems I'm going down to the of
fice and finding out what is going on."
The CSS Assembly in 1973 endorsed a set
of practices for the administration of financial
aid to "provide guidance to institutions and to
insure the fair and equitable treatment of stu
dent aid applicants."
One recommended practice is "conducting
periodic reviews of the institution's total fi
nancial aid process in order to serve students
and the institution better." Johnson said that
the FAO does indeed have periodic reviews.
"We often give formal evaluations; however,
they are not written."
The CSS Assembly explains that, "The pri
mary purpose of a collegiate financial aid pro
gram should be to provide financial assistance
to accepted students who, without such aid,
would be unable to attend that college. The
amount of aid offered should not exceed the
amount needed to meet the difference be
tween the student's total educational ex
penses and the family's resources."
Is the FAO at Stanford doing this? It is
hard to say. The FAO thinks so, but has no
facts to support its claim. Many less
financially-well-off students think not, yet go
skiing in Lake Tahoe several times a year.
One sophomore said, "I couldn't go to
Stanford without the aid I get. Still, I'm sure
my dad could pay more than he is right now."
And a senior remarked that, "I would have
gone to Stanford whether I got aid or not.
This just makes it easier."
Another senior explained, "I was paying a
lot to go to Stanford and then someone from
the Financial Aid Office told me that I should
have my dad write that he didn't feel respon
sible for paying for my education. I lived with
my mom and she only works part time. All of
a sudden I'm getting double what I did before
and nothing has changed."
