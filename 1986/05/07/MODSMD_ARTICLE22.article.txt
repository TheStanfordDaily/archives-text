## Tresidder offers scientific safari through the tropics 
### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
Asian pileated gibbons are scream
ing. South American red howler
monkeys are making low, throaty
roars. And birds of all types are call
ing and singing with a thousand dif
ferent voices. It's happening right
now in, of all places, the upstairs
lounge of Tresidder Union.
From now through the end of
May," Under the Canopy," an audio
visual exhibit about the plight of the
world's tropical rainforests, will be on
display in Tresidder. This display is
one facet of a larger program,
"Tropical Rainforests: Crisis and Op
portunity," which also includes a
lecture series and proposed "plan for
action."
The whole agenda is being pre
sented by the Program in Human Bi
ology, courtesy of the California
Academy of Sciences.
The program's coordinator is Dr.
David Sutton, a staff member and
part of the associated faculty for the
Human Biology Department. "This is

a critical issue we're dealing with," he
said, "one of incredible urgency.
Rainforests are now being destroyed
or degraded at an unprecedented
pace. At current rates, the only tropi
cal rainforest left on earth by the year
2000 will probably be in small iso
lated patches in Brazil and Africa."
This represents an incalculable loss
to humanity and to the planet, Sutton
said. Not only do the forests have an
intrinsic, aesthetic value of their own,
but they are potentially extremely
valuable to man, he added.
The forests "comprise a mere 6
percent of the world's land surface
area and yet they contain over 50
percent of the world's total species,"
Sutton said. This biological variety or
"genetic diversity," as it is called, is
valuable not only in an ecological
sense, he explained, but also to
modern medicine and science,
primarily as a source of new drugs.
The value of the forests extends far
beyond this, however. "They provide
us with food, medicine, germplasm
stocks to improve our crops, and also
help stabilize climate at the global

level," Sutton said.
One irony of the rapid deforesta
tion taking place is that few people
actually benefit, Sutton said. People
cut down these forests expecting to
find rich agricultural land under
neath, but "this doesn't happen," he
added, because most of the nutrients
in the rain forest ecosystem are
bound up in the trees and plants, not
in the soil.
In addition, Sutton said, deforesta
tion displaces native peoples who
have no understanding of or prepara
tion for life in the outside world.
Some of the program's lecturers will
discuss the fate of these people, as
well as questioning the general wis
dom of using Western models of de
velopment in Third World countries
— Sutton sees this as one of the prime
causes of deforestation.
"Tropical Rainforests: Crisis and
Opportunity," is in part an outgrowth
of a desire of students in Sutton's
winter quarter Environmental Policy
class "for a program of events de
signed to carry our concerns to the
larger campus community," he said.

adding that this should be one of edu
cation's aims.
The lecture series portion of the
program will run as follows:
• Tues., May 6, 7-9 p.m.; Oak
Lounge East, Tresidder. "Iropical
Rainforests and Deforestation,''
Peter Vitousek, Department of Bio
logical Sciences.
• Wed., May 14, 7-9 p.m.; Room
132, Tresidder. "Virgin Rainforests
or Untouched Wilderness? Native
Amazonians Challenge both Conser
vation and Development Views,"
Nickie Irvine, Anthropology Depart
ment.
• Tues., May 20, 7-9 p.m.; Cypress
South, Tresidder. "Amazonian
Voices of the Rainforest," Glen
Switkes and Monti Aguirre,
filmmakers who have recently
returned from Brazil.
• Wed., May 28, 7-9 p.m.; Oak
Lounge East, Tresidder. "Plan for
Action," Randy Hayes, director of
Rainforest Action Network.
