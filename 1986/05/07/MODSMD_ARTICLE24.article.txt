## Aggies top Cardinal in extra innings 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Life is sometimes full of unpleasant
surprises.
That was all too true for the Stan
ford baseball team in yesterdays
non-conference matchup with lowly
UC-Davis ot the Northern California
Athletic Conference.
The Cardinal was lackluster all af
ternoon, but seemed to have the
game wrapped up in the top of the
ninth inning, holding a 6-4 lead with
two outs and a lonely Aggie baserun
ner on first.
Surprise! In the blink of an eyelash,
Aggie designated hitter Joe Breider
redirected an A 1 Osuna changeup
over the leftfield fence to send the
game into extra innings. In the 10th,
the Aggies erupted for five runs, then
held off a furious Stanford rally in the
bottom of the inning to grab an 11-9
upset victory of the No. 13 Cardinal.
The loss dropped Stanford's season
record to 32-20. The Cardinal, com
ing off two convincing wins over Pac
-10 Southern Division powerhouse
Arizona, is currently in second place
in the Six-Pac, with a 16-11 league
record.
A team's non-conference record
plays a significant part in determining
a team's post-season placement.
Therefore, yesterday's loss weighs
heavily on the Cardinal, especially at
this point in the year, with only four
games remaining in the regular
season.
"These are important games for us,
because we're trying to get a spot in
the regionals," Stanford third
baseman Ruben Amarosaid. "Losing
a game like this is going to hurt in get
ting a bid. We need to stay up for
every game . . . that's the key."
For the Aggies, the victory was the
24th of the year to go with 21 defeats.
It had to be sweet revenge for UC-
Davis, which suffered a 20-5 embar
rassment at the hands of the Cardinal
last year.
"It feels good," Breider said. "It
has been a goal of mine to beat Stan
ford."
Breider got a little help from Card
inal miscues in reaching that goal.

The Aggies were able to load the
bases with one out in the first on a
leadoff single by rightfielder James
Salisbury, a Stanford fielding error
and a base on balls issued by Cardinal
starter Steve Chitren. UC-Davis
could manage only one run, but the
sloppy play of the Cardinal in that in
ning set the tone for the rest of the
game.

In fact, the Aggies hastened to dis
play some shoddy play of their own.
In the Stanford half of the first, UC-
Davis starter Gary Rowe walked
Amaro and Mark Davis to open the
inning. After a fielder's choice
grounder by Toi Cook, Amaro was
on third and Cook on first. Cook then
stole second, and Aggie catcher Doug
Franklin's throw to second landed

just past the mound and skipped into
centerfield, sending Amaro home
with the tying run.
That was all the scoring until the
fourth. Chitren recorded four strike
outs over the next two innings, while
in the third the Cardinal had one
baserunner picked off second and an
other nailed attempting to steal
second.

In the fourth, with the score still 1-
1, Bob Rinaldi led off for the Aggies
with a sharp single into leftfield. The
next batter, stringbean shortstop
David Vanderpan, sent a line drive
over the leftfield fence to put UC-
Davis up 3-1. After two more Card
inal errors and a groundout to the
right side of the infield, the Aggies
had second baseman Jamie Williams

on third and centerfielder Scott Ruth
er on second. When Chitren threw
errantly in an attempted pickoff of
Ruther, Williams scrambled home to
make the score 4-1.
The Aggies must have been feeling
a bit guilty about all the charity they
had been receiving. They returned
the favors in the bottom of the fourth,
and Stanford wasted no time in knot
ting the game up again.
Leadoff batter Toi Cook landed on
second after a two-base throwing
gaffe by Aggie third baseman
Rinaldi. First baseman Doug Robbins
brought Cook home with a double off
the wall in left-center then scored
himself on designated hitter Mike
Deßenon's line single into left.
Deßenon advanced to third on a
passed ball and crossed the plate on
shortstop Frank Carey's ground
single between first and second.
The score remained tied 4-4 until
the eighth, with the Cardinal losing
two consecutive baserunners on at
tempted steals of second in the fifth
and then stranding two runner's in
both the sixth and seventh.
In the eighth, however, the Card
inal didn't squander its golden oppor
tunity.
Deßenon drew a walk to open the
inning, then Carey was hit with a
pitch to put two on with none out.
Deßenon stole third and scored when
Aggie reliever Andy Calbreath un
corked a wild pitch. That made the
score 5-4. and Carey came around
with an insurance run on a bunt single
by Amaro and a sacrifice fly by Davis.
The Cardinal looked pretty com
fortable at that point. But Breider
lived up to his nickname, "Thunder,"
and struck unexpectedly with the
game-tying homer.
"It was a changeup," Breider said
of Osuna's fateful pitch. "He kind of
gave it away when he dipped down."
Osuna came back for the 10th, but
was quickly battered with an infield
single by leadoff hitter Brad Harms
and a double into the rightfield cor
ner by John Leßeau. After an inten
tional walk to Steve Roberts, the
bases were loaded with no outs.


Mike Topolovac/Dailv
Steve Chitren's pickoff throw to Doug Robbins was not on time as the caught stealing, and one was pieked off while the Cardinal fell 11-9 to
Cardinal experienced "one of those days." Three Stanford runners were UC-Davis in 10 innings.
