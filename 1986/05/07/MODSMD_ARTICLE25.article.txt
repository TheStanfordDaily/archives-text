Despite a strong performance and
the desire to end its loss-laden season
on a positive note, the Stanford
softball team was unable to overcome
the powerful Golden Bears and lost
5-1 and 1-0 to California in yester
day's season finale.
"We played well, but we were
beaten by a strong team," Stanford
Coach Kathy Lincoln said. "We
didn't play poorly, but Cal is ranked
in the top 10 in the country and is a
good team."
Lincoln cited pitching as the reason
for the defeat. "We were hit in the
first game," she said. "Lisa
(Buchanan) pitched well in the
second game, but Betsy (Watson) got
hit in the first.
"They earned the hits they got,"
she added.
The Cardinal's hitting effort was
somewhat stronger than its pitching.
"Lisa Buchanan hit well,"' Lincoln
said, "and Kathy (Dominguez) got a
hit in the second game. Anna
(Sanchez) hit the ball well, but it
didn't fall."
For Dominguez and Sanchez, the
team's two seniors, the Cal games
marked the end of their collegiate
softball careers. "The seniors were a
little sentimental, and both played
really well," teammate Buchanan

ship. Wagner's 235 total is the second-lowest Stanford score behind teammate Don Walsworth, who is second
in the tourney with a 225.
