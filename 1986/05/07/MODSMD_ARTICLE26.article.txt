# Walsworth holds second in Pac-10s
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The third round of the Pacific 10
Conference Championships yester
day provided support for the adage,
"The more things change, the more
they stay the same."
The Wood Ranch Golf Course was
made a little easier, hut all that did
was lower scores across the board,
while leaving almost everyone in the
same position. The Stanford men's
golf team is an example; it subtracted
17 strokes from its second-round
score of 398 on the way to a 54-hole
total of 1,181, while remaining in
fifth place.
"The course was set tip much more
easily today," Stanford Coach Tim
Schaaf said. "1 imagine tomorrow
they'll set it up a little more difficult."
Oregon seemed to notice the
change the most, as it shot a
tournament-low seven-over-par 367
yesterday to rise from fourth to
second place in the tournament. The
Ducks exchanged places with
Arizona State, which shot 385 and
now is at 1,171, 10 strokes ahead of
Stanford.
"Oregon played an excellent round
today." Schaaf said. "We played a
little bit better, (but) so did most
everybody else."
The eight other schools retained
their first-day positions. USC, which
shot 375 yesterday, continues to lead
the tournament by a seven-stroke
margin with its total of 1,154.
Defending Pac-10 champion UCLA
is in third at 1.169, eight shots behind
Oregon.
In sixth place is Washington at

1,193, just two swings behind the
Cardinal but 16 ahead of seventh
place Arizona. Following them are
Oregon State, California and Wash
ington State.
The individual scores also show
more of the same. USC's Sam Ran
dolph and Stanford's Don Walsworth
each shot rounds of 75 (for
Walsworth it was his third straight
75) to maintain their one-two posi
tions in the tourney. Actually,
Walsworth led late in the third round,
hut he bogeyed two of the last three
holes while Randolph birdied all
three to take the lead, 222-225.
ASU's Bill Mayfair is just one be
hind Walsworth at 226, while USCs
Terrence Miskell and Washington's
Jeff Bloom are tied for fourth at 228.
Stanford seniors Carl Wagner and
Phil Rowley improved greatly yester
day as they both fired 73's. Wagner
now has a total of 235, second behind
Walsworth, while Rowley's total of
243 leaves him three behind Rich
Marik. though Marik shot an 81 yes
terday. his poorest round of the
tournament.
"Carl and Phil obviously played
much, much better." Schaaf said.
Roger Miraglia had an 80 to close
the day at 244. while John Dickey's
84 put him at 248.
With one round left in the tourna
ment, Stanford still has an outside
chance at a third-place finish. The
Cardinal will be chasing UCLA and
ASU in its last chance to impress the
NCAA tournament selection com
mittee.
"Heaven knows we can play better
than we have so far." Schaaf said.
