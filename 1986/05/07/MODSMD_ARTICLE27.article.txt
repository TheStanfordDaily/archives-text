# A 						writer's impressions of the world of crew
## Rowers rise early for morning workouts 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
5:43 .. . a.m. It's time to get on "The Bus. The Bus:
an old heap of metal of a sort of orange-green color, the
means of transportation for Stanford's varsity men s crew
team to and from its practice site on the San Francisco
Bay. On its front is taped an S' with an oar through it. not
quite the work of a graphic design major. Inside. 16 men
are slumped on green seats, praying that the bus will never
get started and they can go back to bed. Their prayers may
be answered.
The Bus starts shaking its the engine revs up. then put
ters out.
"Did someone put gas in this yesterday? someone
asks.
•"We put buckets of gas in this thing.'
"Buckets?"

The engine revs up. "There's one (bucket)." It revs up
again, "There's another one."
5:5 I — The Bus is rumbling down Embarcadero Drive
on its way to Highway 101. On the back seat sit two
rowers, one staring straight ahead in a glazed trance, the
other reading. Sitting next to the seat, on the floor, an
other team member is asleep.
But not for long ... a friendly teammate screams at his
sleeping comrade and throws a hall of athletic tape at him.
Nobody deserves to be less tired than anybody else.
5:56 — The Bus turns off 101 into a wasteland of
marshland ;ind nondescript warehouse buildings. The
sight of masts a few hundred yards ahead signals that the
boathouse is near.
6:01 — The Bus has made it.and the rowers struggle
out into the brisk morning air. The boathouse looks like
an aluminum garage from the outside. A look inside
reveals boats stacked up on the walls and hanging upside

down from the ceiling. Just inside the entrance, rows of
oars are lined up. their red and white blades reaching
toward the ceiling.
Facing the water from the boathouse. one sees on the
left a makeshift set of weights and benches. On the right is
a mammoth black barge-like ship.
" Did you see the spy ship?" one of the rowers asks. He
says they don't pay any attention to it. "except when they
start monitoring us with machine guns."
The same rower points out the salt piles 100 or so feet
to the left. In the past, some of the team members have
taken advantage of the pure white mountains of salt to get
in some skiing practice.
6:07 — It's time to get down to business. The varsity
teams meet at the back of the boathi ;se with their coach.
Ken Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss. w ho in his participating days was
obviously not a rower, but a coxswain, is dwarfed by his
lanky students, w ho form a semi-circle of Stanford crew

sweatshirts around him. As the team gets further into its
workout, these layers of warmth will start to disappear.
The quiet but firm voice of the coach talks casually of
the big weekend coming up in two weeks, the Pacific
Coast Championships. He tells the team where it is
seeded, whom it will face and how a win in its first race
would really catapult Stanford into the next one.
6: 15 — The novice squads have taken their boats out.
and the varsity teams get ready to do the same. The Var
sity I shell sits low towards the floor between high stacks
of other shells. Near its stern is the name "Clifford
Burnhill." It is beautifully sleek, has a red wood tone and
holds a very high-tech system of crew gadgets.
Before each of the eight sliding seats is a small speaker
which projects the commands of the coxswain from his
seat at the bow. From there he speaks through a
microphone and keeps his eye on the
timing monitor at his feet which
somehow automatically measures the
crew's stroke rate through the sliding
of the seats.
Attached to each of the foot rests is
a pair of black Adidas shoes with
white stripes waiting for somebody's
feet. First, though, the team must
take care of the difficult task of put
ting the shell in the water and getting
into it without tipping it over.

Meanwhile, remember, it's just
past 6 a.m., and very cold. "I think
it's colder than it was in January,"
Dreyfuss says.
6:30 — The eight rowers carry
their boat down a wooden ramp to
the small dock and lower it into the
water. Each oarsman has one foot on
the dock, one in the shell. On the
count of three they push off and then
sit down. With both varsity boats in
the water now, Dreyfuss gets his red
rubber motorboat going and tails be
hind his team, which will warm up for
about 10 minutes.
Dreyfuss says that, despite its in

dustrial surroundings, the team's
practice site is excellent because the
water is so calm. This morning, small
ripples roll across the surface. "It's a
little rougher than usual," he says.
Dreyfuss also talks about the great
togetherness of the team, something
he will stress throughout the practice.
"It's a good little community we have
here, it's nice ( ."
In between his comments, Dreyfuss
calmly directs advice and compli
ments to individual rowers, "You
want your arms out here at half
slide"; "Good control, Brian."
6:38 — Because the biggest meet

of the season is in just a couple days,
Dreyfuss is alternating the usual hard
workouts with what he calls "style
workouts." Today is a style workout.
The team will progress from rowing
with just their arms to, at the end of
the practice, going all out. Along the
way, Dreyfuss hardly ever stops
coaching, pointing out even the most
minute details.
"Steve, head down an inch. Rob,
you might want to move up on your
slide an inch."
Two eight-men boats rowing in
near isolation on a smooth Bay is a
perfect picture of controlled strength.

The boats ride just six inches out of
the water and skim across the water
without a break, except for a barely
perceptible stutter as the blades are
pulled through and the speed picks
up.
What seems so smooth and relaxed
(and fun) to the outside observer is,
of course, very difficult, very
strenuous. And so, the beauty of a
crew pulling through the water, sil
houetted by the bright morning sun
right behind it on the horizon, is very
deceiving. An unobscured view of the
rowers' faces is the only thing that
shows the pain and fatigue they are
going through.
Dreyfuss stresses the importance of
having a sense for good rowing. "I've
never seen you row better in this
drill," he tells his rowers. "You
should just feel different."
7:04 — The sweatshirts start com
ing off, and Dreyfuss' cap is blown off
as his launch runs parallel to the
shells. The workout is getting more
intense. The slap of the blades into
the water can now be heard through
the motorboat's purr. "Now we're
moving!" the coach yells.
7:30 — It's time to bring it all to
gether for the homestretch. Starting
at 20 strokes at a rate of 30-strokes
per-minute, the strokes will decrease
and the rate increase until a filial
thrust of ten strokes at a rate of 40-
per-minute.
7:45 — It's over and as the boats
head towards the dock, Dreyfuss
talks again of the team's great im
provement. "They're learning, com
ing together, getting to know each
other," he says. "They're thinking
about their rowing, they're realty
thinking." *
8:04 — The sculls are back in the
boathouse and everybody is back oh
The Bus. The engine is successfully
started and now adventure remains
only in each gear shift — particularly
difficult shifts are applauded by the
passengers — and in getting over into
the far right lane of 101 to catch th£
exit. An Audi almost gets crushed,
and the driver finds it necessary to
use The Bus' obnoxious horn mor£
than once, but the lane is reached and
soon The Bus is back on campus. '
Today is an especially good (jay,
because everyone should be back to
his dorm in time for breakfast.

(and fun) to the outside observer is,
of course, very difficult, very
strenuous. And so, the beauty of a
crew pulling through the water, sil
houetted by the bright morning sun
right behind it on the horizon, is very
deceiving. An unobscured view of the
rowers' faces is the only thing that
shows the pain and fatigue they are
going through.
Dreyfuss stresses the importance of
having a sense for good rowing. "I've
never seen you row better in this
drill," he tells his rowers. "You
should just feel different."
7:04 — The sweatshirts start com
ing off, and Dreyfuss' cap is blown off
as his launch runs parallel to the
shells. The workout is getting more
intense. The slap of the blades into
the water can now be heard through
the motorboat's purr. "Now we're
moving!" the coach yells.
7:30 — It's time to bring it all to
gether for the homestretch. Starting
at 20 strokes at a rate of 30-strokes
per-minute, the strokes will decrease
and the rate increase until a filial
thrust of ten strokes at a rate of 40-
per-minute.
7:45 — It's over and as the boats
head towards the dock, Dreyfuss
talks again of the team's great im
provement. "They're learning, com
ing together, getting to know each
other," he says. "They're thinking
about their rowing, they're realty
thinking." *
8:04 — The sculls are back in the
boathouse and everybody is back oh
The Bus. The engine is successfully
started and now adventure remains
only in each gear shift — particularly
difficult shifts are applauded by the
passengers — and in getting over into
the far right lane of 101 to catch th£
exit. An Audi almost gets crushed,
and the driver finds it necessary to
use The Bus' obnoxious horn mor£
than once, but the lane is reached and
soon The Bus is back on campus. '
Today is an especially good (jay,

Dedication is the name of the game in crew. Stanford rowers rise before
sunrise in order to begin their workout on San Francisco Bay by 6 a.m.

Lisa Romerein/Daily file
The squad is currently working toward the Pac-lOs which will be held
May 17-18.
5:43 .. . a.m. It's time to get on "The Bus. The Bus:
an old heap of metal of a sort of orange-green color, the
means of transportation for Stanford's varsity men s crew
team to and from its practice site on the San Francisco
Bay. On its front is taped an S' with an oar through it. not
quite the work of a graphic design major. Inside. 16 men
are slumped on green seats, praying that the bus will never
get started and they can go back to bed. Their prayers may
be answered.
The Bus starts shaking its the engine revs up. then put
ters out.
"Did someone put gas in this yesterday? someone
asks.
•"We put buckets of gas in this thing.'
"Buckets?"

The engine revs up. "There's one (bucket)." It revs up
again, "There's another one."
5:5 I — The Bus is rumbling down Embarcadero Drive
on its way to Highway 101. On the back seat sit two
rowers, one staring straight ahead in a glazed trance, the
other reading. Sitting next to the seat, on the floor, an
other team member is asleep.
But not for long ... a friendly teammate screams at his
sleeping comrade and throws a hall of athletic tape at him.
Nobody deserves to be less tired than anybody else.
5:56 — The Bus turns off 101 into a wasteland of
marshland ;ind nondescript warehouse buildings. The
sight of masts a few hundred yards ahead signals that the
boathouse is near.
6:01 — The Bus has made it.and the rowers struggle
out into the brisk morning air. The boathouse looks like
an aluminum garage from the outside. A look inside
reveals boats stacked up on the walls and hanging upside

down from the ceiling. Just inside the entrance, rows of
oars are lined up. their red and white blades reaching
toward the ceiling.
Facing the water from the boathouse. one sees on the
left a makeshift set of weights and benches. On the right is
a mammoth black barge-like ship.
" Did you see the spy ship?" one of the rowers asks. He
says they don't pay any attention to it. "except when they
start monitoring us with machine guns."
The same rower points out the salt piles 100 or so feet
to the left. In the past, some of the team members have
taken advantage of the pure white mountains of salt to get
in some skiing practice.
6:07 — It's time to get down to business. The varsity
teams meet at the back of the boathi ;se with their coach.
Ken Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss. w ho in his participating days was
obviously not a rower, but a coxswain, is dwarfed by his
lanky students, w ho form a semi-circle of Stanford crew

sweatshirts around him. As the team gets further into its
workout, these layers of warmth will start to disappear.
The quiet but firm voice of the coach talks casually of
the big weekend coming up in two weeks, the Pacific
Coast Championships. He tells the team where it is
seeded, whom it will face and how a win in its first race
would really catapult Stanford into the next one.
6: 15 — The novice squads have taken their boats out.
and the varsity teams get ready to do the same. The Var
sity I shell sits low towards the floor between high stacks
of other shells. Near its stern is the name "Clifford
Burnhill." It is beautifully sleek, has a red wood tone and
holds a very high-tech system of crew gadgets.
Before each of the eight sliding seats is a small speaker
which projects the commands of the coxswain from his
seat at the bow. From there he speaks through a
microphone and keeps his eye on the
timing monitor at his feet which
somehow automatically measures the
crew's stroke rate through the sliding
of the seats.
Attached to each of the foot rests is
a pair of black Adidas shoes with
white stripes waiting for somebody's
feet. First, though, the team must
take care of the difficult task of put
ting the shell in the water and getting
into it without tipping it over.

Meanwhile, remember, it's just
past 6 a.m., and very cold. "I think
it's colder than it was in January,"
Dreyfuss says.
6:30 — The eight rowers carry
their boat down a wooden ramp to
the small dock and lower it into the
water. Each oarsman has one foot on
the dock, one in the shell. On the
count of three they push off and then
sit down. With both varsity boats in
the water now, Dreyfuss gets his red
rubber motorboat going and tails be
hind his team, which will warm up for
about 10 minutes.
Dreyfuss says that, despite its in

dustrial surroundings, the team's
practice site is excellent because the
water is so calm. This morning, small
ripples roll across the surface. "It's a
little rougher than usual," he says.
Dreyfuss also talks about the great
togetherness of the team, something
he will stress throughout the practice.
"It's a good little community we have
here, it's nice ( ."
In between his comments, Dreyfuss
calmly directs advice and compli
ments to individual rowers, "You
want your arms out here at half
slide"; "Good control, Brian."
6:38 — Because the biggest meet

of the season is in just a couple days,
Dreyfuss is alternating the usual hard
workouts with what he calls "style
workouts." Today is a style workout.
The team will progress from rowing
with just their arms to, at the end of
the practice, going all out. Along the
way, Dreyfuss hardly ever stops
coaching, pointing out even the most
minute details.
"Steve, head down an inch. Rob,
you might want to move up on your
slide an inch."
Two eight-men boats rowing in
near isolation on a smooth Bay is a
perfect picture of controlled strength.

The boats ride just six inches out of
the water and skim across the water
without a break, except for a barely
perceptible stutter as the blades are
pulled through and the speed picks
up.
What seems so smooth and relaxed
(and fun) to the outside observer is,
of course, very difficult, very
strenuous. And so, the beauty of a
crew pulling through the water, sil
houetted by the bright morning sun

Attached to each of the foot rests is
a pair of black Adidas shoes with
white stripes waiting for somebody's
feet. First, though, the team must
take care of the difficult task of put
ting the shell in the water and getting
into it without tipping it over.

Meanwhile, remember, it's just
past 6 a.m., and very cold. "I think
it's colder than it was in January,"
Dreyfuss says.
6:30 — The eight rowers carry
their boat down a wooden ramp to
the small dock and lower it into the
water. Each oarsman has one foot on
the dock, one in the shell. On the
count of three they push off and then
sit down. With both varsity boats in
the water now, Dreyfuss gets his red
rubber motorboat going and tails be
hind his team, which will warm up for
about 10 minutes.
Dreyfuss says that, despite its in

dustrial surroundings, the team's
practice site is excellent because the
water is so calm. This morning, small
ripples roll across the surface. "It's a
little rougher than usual," he says.
Dreyfuss also talks about the great
togetherness of the team, something
he will stress throughout the practice.
"It's a good little community we have
here, it's nice ( ."
In between his comments, Dreyfuss
calmly directs advice and compli
ments to individual rowers, "You
want your arms out here at half
slide"; "Good control, Brian."
6:38 — Because the biggest meet

of the season is in just a couple days,
Dreyfuss is alternating the usual hard
workouts with what he calls "style
workouts." Today is a style workout.
The team will progress from rowing
with just their arms to, at the end of
the practice, going all out. Along the
way, Dreyfuss hardly ever stops
coaching, pointing out even the most
minute details.
"Steve, head down an inch. Rob,
you might want to move up on your
slide an inch."
Two eight-men boats rowing in
near isolation on a smooth Bay is a
perfect picture of controlled strength.

The boats ride just six inches out of
the water and skim across the water
without a break, except for a barely
perceptible stutter as the blades are
pulled through and the speed picks
up.
What seems so smooth and relaxed
(and fun) to the outside observer is,
of course, very difficult, very
strenuous. And so, the beauty of a
crew pulling through the water, sil
houetted by the bright morning sun
right behind it on the horizon, is very
deceiving. An unobscured view of the
rowers' faces is the only thing that
shows the pain and fatigue they are
going through.
Dreyfuss stresses the importance of
having a sense for good rowing. "I've
never seen you row better in this
drill," he tells his rowers. "You
should just feel different."
7:04 — The sweatshirts start com
ing off, and Dreyfuss' cap is blown off
as his launch runs parallel to the
shells. The workout is getting more
intense. The slap of the blades into
the water can now be heard through
the motorboat's purr. "Now we're
moving!" the coach yells.
7:30 — It's time to bring it all to
gether for the homestretch. Starting
at 20 strokes at a rate of 30-strokes
per-minute, the strokes will decrease
and the rate increase until a filial
thrust of ten strokes at a rate of 40-
per-minute.
7:45 — It's over and as the boats
head towards the dock, Dreyfuss
talks again of the team's great im
provement. "They're learning, com
ing together, getting to know each
other," he says. "They're thinking
about their rowing, they're realty
thinking." *
8:04 — The sculls are back in the
boathouse and everybody is back oh
The Bus. The engine is successfully
started and now adventure remains
only in each gear shift — particularly
difficult shifts are applauded by the
passengers — and in getting over into
the far right lane of 101 to catch th£
exit. An Audi almost gets crushed,
and the driver finds it necessary to
use The Bus' obnoxious horn mor£
than once, but the lane is reached and
soon The Bus is back on campus. '
Today is an especially good (jay,
because everyone should be back to
his dorm in time for breakfast.


Dedication is the name of the game in crew. Stanford rowers rise before
sunrise in order to begin their workout on San Francisco Bay by 6 a.m.
