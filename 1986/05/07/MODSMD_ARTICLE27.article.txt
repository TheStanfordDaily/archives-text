						writer's impressions of the world of crew
## Rowers rise early for morning workouts 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
5:43 .. . a.m. It's time to get on "The Bus. The Bus:
an old heap of metal of a sort of orange-green color, the
means of transportation for Stanford's varsity men s crew
team to and from its practice site on the San Francisco
Bay. On its front is taped an S' with an oar through it. not
quite the work of a graphic design major. Inside. 16 men
are slumped on green seats, praying that the bus will never
get started and they can go back to bed. Their prayers may
be answered.
The Bus starts shaking its the engine revs up. then put
ters out.
"Did someone put gas in this yesterday? someone
asks.
•"We put buckets of gas in this thing.'
"Buckets?"

The engine revs up. "There's one (bucket)." It revs up
again, "There's another one."
5:5 I — The Bus is rumbling down Embarcadero Drive
on its way to Highway 101. On the back seat sit two
rowers, one staring straight ahead in a glazed trance, the
other reading. Sitting next to the seat, on the floor, an
other team member is asleep.
But not for long ... a friendly teammate screams at his
sleeping comrade and throws a hall of athletic tape at him.
Nobody deserves to be less tired than anybody else.
5:56 — The Bus turns off 101 into a wasteland of
marshland ;ind nondescript warehouse buildings. The
sight of masts a few hundred yards ahead signals that the
boathouse is near.
6:01 — The Bus has made it.and the rowers struggle
out into the brisk morning air. The boathouse looks like
an aluminum garage from the outside. A look inside
reveals boats stacked up on the walls and hanging upside

down from the ceiling. Just inside the entrance, rows of
oars are lined up. their red and white blades reaching
toward the ceiling.
Facing the water from the boathouse. one sees on the
left a makeshift set of weights and benches. On the right is
a mammoth black barge-like ship.
" Did you see the spy ship?" one of the rowers asks. He
says they don't pay any attention to it. "except when they
start monitoring us with machine guns."
The same rower points out the salt piles 100 or so feet
to the left. In the past, some of the team members have
taken advantage of the pure white mountains of salt to get
in some skiing practice.
6:07 — It's time to get down to business. The varsity
teams meet at the back of the boathi ;se with their coach.
Ken Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss. w ho in his participating days was
obviously not a rower, but a coxswain, is dwarfed by his
lanky students, w ho form a semi-circle of Stanford crew

sweatshirts around him. As the team gets further into its
workout, these layers of warmth will start to disappear.
The quiet but firm voice of the coach talks casually of
the big weekend coming up in two weeks, the Pacific
Coast Championships. He tells the team where it is
seeded, whom it will face and how a win in its first race
would really catapult Stanford into the next one.
6: 15 — The novice squads have taken their boats out.
and the varsity teams get ready to do the same. The Var
sity I shell sits low towards the floor between high stacks
of other shells. Near its stern is the name "Clifford
Burnhill." It is beautifully sleek, has a red wood tone and
holds a very high-tech system of crew gadgets.
Before each of the eight sliding seats is a small speaker
which projects the commands of the coxswain from his
seat at the bow. From there he speaks through a
