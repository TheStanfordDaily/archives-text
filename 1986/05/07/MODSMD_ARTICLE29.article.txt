Arms negotiations focus on Libya
GENEVA — U.S. and Soviet negotiators returned yesterday for a
fifth round of nuclear arms talks, but a bitter exchange of charges involv
ing Libya quickly stole the spotlight from the deadlocked negotiations.
Soviet negotiator Viktor Karpov, in an opening statement, accused
the United States of "doing virtually nothing" to further the arms talks,
then declared in a reference to the U.S. April 15 raid on Libya:
"Indeed, most recently — this time outside these negotiations — the
United States has taken actions openly aimed at escalating tensions and
heightening the military threat. This cannot but alarm everybody."
U.S. Ambassador Max Kampelman, in a last minute addition to his
prepared statement, expressed regret at Karpov's "disappointing state
ment."
"He makes an unmistakable, critical reference to the military action
taken by the United States against the terrorist state of Libya," Kampel
man said. " A regime with 120,000 of its troops invading and subjugating
Afghanistan and its peoples is in no moral or political position to feign
outrage when we defend ourselves against Libya's undeclared war
against the United States and its people."
Kampelman added: "We cannot help but be reminded that it is the
Soviet Union which supplies and encourages (Libyan leader Col. Moam
mar) Khadafy and his attempt to terrorize the Western World and its
free people."
Berlin terrorist explosions linked
BONN, West Germany — Ahmed Nawaf Mansour Hasi, a stateless
Palestinian who was detained in the April 5 discotheque bombing in
West Berlin that led to retaliatory U.S. air strikes on Libya, said he
carried out a similar terrorist attack a week earlier at the German-Arab
Friendship Society, West Berlin judiciary officials said yesterday.
Police sources said Hasi and his brother, Nezar Hindawi, plotted the
Easter explosion that destroyed the German-Arab office and injured
seven persons after a heated argument with moderate members who
defended the "apolitical character" of the group. Hindawi is now under
London police custody on charges of trying to blow up an El A 1 jetliner
carrying 400 passengers by planting a bomb in the suitcase of an un
suspecting girlfriend before she boarded the plane.
Hasi has continued to deny that he played any role in the explosion
that killed two persons, including an American serviceman, and injured
230. But security sources said there is sufficient evidence, including
sketches of intended terror targets in the city, to keep him in inves
tigative custody.
Volker Kaehne, a city justice department spokesman, said in an inter
view that police had established that Hasi and Salameh had secured ex
plosives from "an Arab office in East Berlin" and made repeated trips
transporting them to the West for use in the attack. Other officials said
the description referred to the Libyan People's Bureau, or embassy, in
East Berlin.
West Berlin police have ascertained certain Libyan connections, in
cluding at least one visit to Tripoli by Hasi since he moved to West Ber
lin in 1975. But security officials said that possible terror links to Syria
also are being closely scrutinized.
West German police have been working with the assistance of allied
intelligence services to determine whether Hasi and his brother may
have received training and direction in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
One security source said the investigation of the La Belle bombing was
"now looking more than it did earlier toward Syria."
West German police officials would not comment on the possible
Syrian links in the case, citing the need to avoid jeopardizing emerging
leads and potential arrests. But one security official predicted that a
major development in the investigation was expected to be confirmed
"in the next few days."
Israel agrees to participate in SDI
W ASHINGTON — Israel, joining Britain and West Germany, agreed
yesterday to participate in research projects intended to develop a U.S.
space-based missile defense system.
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and U.S. Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger signed an agreement at the Pentagon providing a
framework for Israeli laboratories and research organizations to partici
pate in the "Star Wars" program, formally known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
Although the multibillion-dollar U.S. research effort is aimed at con
structing a defense against long-range ballistic missiles, a Pentagon offi
cial indicated that Israel's focus would be directed more toward develop
ing protection against tactical, short-range ballistic missiles, which are
considered to be more of a threat to Israel.
"They have indicated they are particularly concerned about the threat
posed to Israel itself by neighboring and other countries which have the
capability to place Israel under attack by shorter-range ballistic
missiles," said Frank Gaffney, a deputy assistant secretary of defense.
Nakasone under fire for rise of yen
TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone came under
attack yesterday for agreeing to condemn Libya as a terrorist nation and
for failing to win the cooperation of other summit leaders to brake the
climb of the yen.
The criticism, from Japanese businessmen, the media and members of
his own ruling party, erupted as the yen's value shot up to yet another
post-World War II record and heightened fears of an economic setback
here.
Despite the hopes expressed before the summit by both Nakasone and
Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita that they would secure allied help to
halt the upward spiral of the yen, the Japanese currency gained 3.3 per
cent in value, compared with last Friday's value, in trading on the Tokyo
Foieign Exchange Market. Trading was closed Monday for a national
holiday.
The yen finished at 165.20 yen to the dollar after momentarily reach
ing 164.85, new postwar highs for both a closing price and a single trans
action.
After the summit closed, Nakasone admitted publicly for the first time
that he was forced to yield to the other six summit leaders' insistence
that Libya be singled out for its sponsorship of international terrorism.
"Except for Japan, all of the countries favored naming Libya because
evidence of its involvement, as a government, was clear," he said. "As
chairman. I was in a position in which I felt I must accept the opinions of
the others."
The labeling of Libya as a terrorist state was regarded here as an aban
donment of the pro-Arab Middle East policy Japan has followed since
the first oil crisis in 1973.
Shultz to meet with Korean leaders
SEOUL. South Korea — A highly charged domestic South Korean
political situation, in which an unprecedented degree of vehement anti-
Americanism has suddenly emerged, will greet Secretary of State
George Shultz on a trip here starting today.
Saturday's violent street clashes in nearby Inchon, led by radical stu
dents demanding the ouster of "American imperialism," is still rever
berating in the heated debate between the government of President
Chun Doo Hwan and its political opposition over the means for picking
the next president.
Shultz, who flies to Seoul from the Tokyo summit this afternoon, will
meet the parliamentary leaders of the government and opposition par
ties as well as Chun and other senior officials. But he has decided to steer
clear of the two leading opposition figures, Kim Dae Jung and Kim
Young Sam.

Foieign Exchange Market. Trading was closed Monday for a national
holiday.
The yen finished at 165.20 yen to the dollar after momentarily reach
ing 164.85, new postwar highs for both a closing price and a single trans
action.
After the summit closed, Nakasone admitted publicly for the first time
that he was forced to yield to the other six summit leaders' insistence
that Libya be singled out for its sponsorship of international terrorism.
"Except for Japan, all of the countries favored naming Libya because
evidence of its involvement, as a government, was clear," he said. "As
chairman. I was in a position in which I felt I must accept the opinions of
the others."
The labeling of Libya as a terrorist state was regarded here as an aban
donment of the pro-Arab Middle East policy Japan has followed since
the first oil crisis in 1973.
Shultz to meet with Korean leaders
SEOUL. South Korea — A highly charged domestic South Korean
political situation, in which an unprecedented degree of vehement anti-
Americanism has suddenly emerged, will greet Secretary of State
George Shultz on a trip here starting today.
Saturday's violent street clashes in nearby Inchon, led by radical stu
dents demanding the ouster of "American imperialism," is still rever
berating in the heated debate between the government of President
Chun Doo Hwan and its political opposition over the means for picking
the next president.
Shultz, who flies to Seoul from the Tokyo summit this afternoon, will
meet the parliamentary leaders of the government and opposition par
ties as well as Chun and other senior officials. But he has decided to steer
clear of the two leading opposition figures, Kim Dae Jung and Kim
Young Sam.
Arms negotiations focus on Libya
GENEVA — U.S. and Soviet negotiators returned yesterday for a
fifth round of nuclear arms talks, but a bitter exchange of charges involv
ing Libya quickly stole the spotlight from the deadlocked negotiations.
Soviet negotiator Viktor Karpov, in an opening statement, accused
the United States of "doing virtually nothing" to further the arms talks,
then declared in a reference to the U.S. April 15 raid on Libya:
"Indeed, most recently — this time outside these negotiations — the
United States has taken actions openly aimed at escalating tensions and
heightening the military threat. This cannot but alarm everybody."
U.S. Ambassador Max Kampelman, in a last minute addition to his
prepared statement, expressed regret at Karpov's "disappointing state
ment."
"He makes an unmistakable, critical reference to the military action
taken by the United States against the terrorist state of Libya," Kampel
man said. " A regime with 120,000 of its troops invading and subjugating
Afghanistan and its peoples is in no moral or political position to feign
outrage when we defend ourselves against Libya's undeclared war
against the United States and its people."
Kampelman added: "We cannot help but be reminded that it is the
Soviet Union which supplies and encourages (Libyan leader Col. Moam
mar) Khadafy and his attempt to terrorize the Western World and its
free people."
Berlin terrorist explosions linked
BONN, West Germany — Ahmed Nawaf Mansour Hasi, a stateless
Palestinian who was detained in the April 5 discotheque bombing in
West Berlin that led to retaliatory U.S. air strikes on Libya, said he
carried out a similar terrorist attack a week earlier at the German-Arab
Friendship Society, West Berlin judiciary officials said yesterday.
Police sources said Hasi and his brother, Nezar Hindawi, plotted the
Easter explosion that destroyed the German-Arab office and injured
seven persons after a heated argument with moderate members who
defended the "apolitical character" of the group. Hindawi is now under
London police custody on charges of trying to blow up an El A 1 jetliner
carrying 400 passengers by planting a bomb in the suitcase of an un
suspecting girlfriend before she boarded the plane.
Hasi has continued to deny that he played any role in the explosion
that killed two persons, including an American serviceman, and injured
230. But security sources said there is sufficient evidence, including
sketches of intended terror targets in the city, to keep him in inves
tigative custody.
Volker Kaehne, a city justice department spokesman, said in an inter
view that police had established that Hasi and Salameh had secured ex
plosives from "an Arab office in East Berlin" and made repeated trips
transporting them to the West for use in the attack. Other officials said
the description referred to the Libyan People's Bureau, or embassy, in
East Berlin.
West Berlin police have ascertained certain Libyan connections, in
cluding at least one visit to Tripoli by Hasi since he moved to West Ber
lin in 1975. But security officials said that possible terror links to Syria
also are being closely scrutinized.
West German police have been working with the assistance of allied
intelligence services to determine whether Hasi and his brother may
have received training and direction in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
One security source said the investigation of the La Belle bombing was
"now looking more than it did earlier toward Syria."
West German police officials would not comment on the possible
Syrian links in the case, citing the need to avoid jeopardizing emerging
leads and potential arrests. But one security official predicted that a
major development in the investigation was expected to be confirmed
"in the next few days."
Israel agrees to participate in SDI
W ASHINGTON — Israel, joining Britain and West Germany, agreed
yesterday to participate in research projects intended to develop a U.S.
space-based missile defense system.
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and U.S. Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger signed an agreement at the Pentagon providing a
framework for Israeli laboratories and research organizations to partici
pate in the "Star Wars" program, formally known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
Although the multibillion-dollar U.S. research effort is aimed at con
structing a defense against long-range ballistic missiles, a Pentagon offi
cial indicated that Israel's focus would be directed more toward develop
ing protection against tactical, short-range ballistic missiles, which are
considered to be more of a threat to Israel.
"They have indicated they are particularly concerned about the threat
posed to Israel itself by neighboring and other countries which have the
capability to place Israel under attack by shorter-range ballistic
missiles," said Frank Gaffney, a deputy assistant secretary of defense.
Nakasone under fire for rise of yen
TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone came under
attack yesterday for agreeing to condemn Libya as a terrorist nation and
for failing to win the cooperation of other summit leaders to brake the
climb of the yen.
The criticism, from Japanese businessmen, the media and members of
his own ruling party, erupted as the yen's value shot up to yet another
post-World War II record and heightened fears of an economic setback
here.
Despite the hopes expressed before the summit by both Nakasone and
Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita that they would secure allied help to
halt the upward spiral of the yen, the Japanese currency gained 3.3 per
cent in value, compared with last Friday's value, in trading on the Tokyo
Foieign Exchange Market. Trading was closed Monday for a national
holiday.
The yen finished at 165.20 yen to the dollar after momentarily reach
