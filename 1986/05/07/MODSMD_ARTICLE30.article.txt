MOSCOW — Soviet officials blamed local ex
perts yesterday for misjudging the severity of the
nuclear accident at Chernobyl and disclosed that
mass evacuations did not start until 36 hours after
the event.
In their first, carefully limited meeting with
reporters since the accident, the officials sought to
minimize fallout levels, and they rejected Western
complaints that the Kremlin had taken too long to
report the accident.
The officials said the incident at Chernobyl
began at 1:23 a.m. Moscow time Saturday, April
26. They gave no reason for making no public an
nouncement until the following Monday evening,
but they insisted that this was a timely notice.
Boris Shcherbina, a deputy premier and head of
a government commission investigating the acci
dent, said the probable cause was a "chemical ex
plosion" while Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 was being
shut down because of an unexplained problem.
He said that when he and other members of the
investigating commission assembled at the site,
about 80 miles north of Kiev, they found a situation
different from what had been described to them
ea r,ior

"In the area, the local experts did not have a cor
rect assessment of the accident," Shcherbina told
about 500 foreign and Soviet reporters. He did not
elaborate, and there was no opportunity to ques
tion him on this point.
The evacuation of 49,000 people in a 19-mile
radius around the plant began at 2 p.m. Moscow
time Sunday and ended less than three hours later,
he said, adding that 1,100 buses were used. Only a
small number of workers were left behind at the
plant, he said.
The officials said, as they have from the outset,
that only two people were killed. They also said
204 people have been hospitalized, not 197, as re
ported earlier. Of these, 100 had been con
taminated by radiation and were flown to Moscow
for special treatment, the officials said. They said
that 18 suffered from "heavy radiation."
One ot the officials, Yevgeny Vorobyev, first
deputy health minister, said that one of the two
men killed "died as the result of very heavy burns,
over 80 percent of his skin," and the other "as a
result of debris that fell on him."
Overall, little new information emerged from the

70-minute session. Shcherbina and Anatoly
Kovalev, first deputy foreign minister, took up half
the period reading prepared statements. Only 10
questions, six in writing and four from the floor,
were allowed, and there was no opportunity for
follow-up questions.
A groan of protest went up from the press when
the moderator, an official of the Foreign Ministry
press department, announced that "all the ques
tions have been asked" and adjourned the news
conference.
On the key question of radiation levels, there ap
peared to be conflicting opinions. Shcherbina said
the highest radiation readings at the reactor site
now are 10 to 15 milliroentgens an hour, a drop of
two to three times from maximum levels right after
the blast. But Yuri Sedunov, deputy chief of the
Meteorology and Environmental Control Commit
tee, said that 15 milliroentgens was the maximum
radiation reading at the plant since the accident
happened.
Sedunov also said that the radioactive fallout has
had no effect on Moscow, about 450 miles north
east of Chernobyl, and he gave a reading for Kiev
of a negligible 0.2 milliroentgens an hour.
