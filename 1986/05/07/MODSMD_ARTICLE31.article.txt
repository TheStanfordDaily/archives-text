# Economic summit concludes
## 
### 
TOKYO — The summit leaders,
after devoting most of their attention
here to terrorism and other political
issues, closed their three-day meeting
yesterday by calling for closer eco
nomic coordination to help smooth
out wild swings in currency markets,
but they declined to support any im
mediate effort to halt the slide of the
dollar.
The final economic declaration of
the 12th summit meeting of the seven
major industrial democracies avoided
any open clash on economic issues
that have been touchy in the past.
In a key trade-off, the United
States, in return for acceptance of its
initiative for a strengthened system of
global economic cooperation that will
include Canada and Italy, dropped its
effort to win commitments from West
Germany and Japan for more
stimulative domestic policies and did
not press France for a firm date to
begin a new round of trade talks.

Several key economic issues,
however, continue to divide the gov
ernments represented here.

The Japanese went away disap
pointed that they did not win support
for halting the rapid rise in the yen —

it stood at a postwar high yesterday
— while the European countries and
the United States continued to press
the Japanese to open their markets
more widely.
A trade war between the United
States and Europe over farm prod
ucts remains a serious threat,
though the economic declaration
issued here acknowledged, for the
first time, that the worldwide surplus
of farm goods is caused by the summit
countries' own agriculture subsidies.
Yet even before the meeting
ended, the outgoing president of the
World Bank criticized the seven
leaders for not living up to their
pledges on free trade. The bank pres
ident, A.W. Clausen, speaking at a
conference in Washington, cited
growing trade restrictions on farm
products and textiles in major indus
trial nations as a danger to debt
ridden Third World countries.
