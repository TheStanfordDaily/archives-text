Gun laws are weakened
WASHINGTON — The Senate acted yester
day to placate the National Rifle Association hut
angered many law enforcement officials as it ap
proved and sent President Reagan a controver
sial bill that would for the first time ease federal
gun laws enacted after the 1968 assassinations of
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy.
The outcome gave the National Rifle Associa
tion and the bill's main sponsors, Sen. James
McClure (R-Idaho) and Rep. Harold Volkmer
(D-Mo.), most of what they wanted in their 18-
year effort to ease federal restrictions on gun
owners and gun dealers. At the same time, a
compromise engineered by Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.)
narrowed some of what the nation's police
groups regarded as dangerous loopholes in the
measure.
The Senate passed both bills — the McClure-
Volkmer measure and Thurmond's clarifying
amendments — by voice vote.
After backstage negotiations that tied up the
Senate for hours, it was agreed that McClure,
Volkmer and the 3-million-member N RA would
not oppose the strengthening amendments in the
House.
McClure declared that "there is no doubt" that
Reagan, a lifetime NRA member, will sign the
bill.
The developments culminate a seven-year
crusade by McClure, Volkmer, and the NRA to
wipe out federal rules restricting interstate sales
and transportation of weapons and requiring gun
dealers to keep detailed sales and inventory
records.

Saudi arms sale rejected
WASHINGTON — The Senate embarked on a
foreign-policy collision course with the Reagan
Administration yesterday night, voting 73 to 22
to reject a proposed $354 million arms sale to
Saudi Arabia.
The vote marked the first time that the Senate
has explicitly rejected a proposed arms sale, and
the margin, if sustained, was large enough to
override an almost certain veto of the resolution
of disapproval by President Reagan.
The House is expected to vote on the resolu
tion today, with opponents of the sale predicting
final passage by close to the two-thirds majority
necessary to override a veto.
Passage of the disapproval resolution by both
chambers had been expected, with the crucial
battle ahead over the attempt to override the an
ticipated veto.
News groups under fire
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion is considering the criminal prosecution of
five news organizations for publishing informa
tion about U.S. intelligence-gathering opera
tions, particularly intercepted communications
reflecting U.S. code-breaking capabilities.
Central Intelligence Agency Director William
Casey said he had discussed the possibility of
such prosecutions — never before initiated
against a newspaper or magazine —with Deputy
Attorney General D. Lowell Jensen at a meeting
last Friday at the Justice Department.
"We've already got five absolutely cold viola

tions," Casey said, according to two Washington
Post editors who met with him later that day.
Casey was apparently referring to alleged viola
tions of a 1950 statute that makes it illegal to
"knowingly and willfully" disclose or publish
classified information about codes, ciphers or
"communication intelligence activities of the
United States or any foreign government." The
CIA director added, however, that no final deci
sion had been made about whether indictments
would be sought.
Casey named the five news organizations as
The Washington Post (for stories about U.S. in
tercepts of messages between Tripoli and the
Libyan People's Bureau in East Berlin),
Newsweek (also for on intercepted Libyan com
munications), The Washington Times, The New
York Times and Time magazine, the last three
for unspecified stories.
The law carries a maximum penalty of 10 years
in prison and a $ 10,000 fine.
Prices close mixed
NEW YORK — Blue chip stocks gave back a
portion of Monday's gain but other stocks fared
better and the market managed to finish nar
rowly mixed in an indecisive session yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
about 19 points on Monday, dropped back by
5.82 to 1,787.95.
Advances edged out declines by about 60 is
sues in the overall tally on the New York Stock
Exchange. The NYSE composite index slipped
0.14 to 136.77.
