Witness hoped for swap
LOS ANGELES — A prosecutor suggested
yesterday that a Soviet woman tailored her tes
timony in her FBI lover's espionage trial, hoping
she'd be traded to Russia in a spy swap.
Svetlana Ogorodnikov, repeatedly seeking
clarification, never answered the central question
but said she's aware such trades occur as she tes
tified for an 11th day in the trial of fired FBI
agent Richard Miller, her former lover.
Miller, 47. the only FBI agent ever charged
with spying, is accused of conspiring with
Ogorodnikov and her husband Nikolay to pass
classified documents to the Soviets in exchange
for promises of $65,000 in cash and gold. The
Ogorodnikovs are serving prison terms after
pleading guilty.
Hayman suggested Ogorodnikov avoided
naming any U.S.-based KGB agent because it
would foster disfavor with the Soviets.
She said she named two KGB officers sta
tioned in Russia but never answered the question
about American-based agents.

Ogorodnikov has insisted she worked for the
FBI, not the KGB. and that Miller "is not a
traitor."
Hayman also produced documents found in
her apartment, which he suggested showed she
was deeply involved in gathering information on
the U.S. defense establishment for the Soviets.
She denied this, saying she wasn't familiar with
most of the documents.
Ramirez must be tried
LOS ANGELES — A judge yesterday or
dered Richard Ramirez to stand trial for 14 mur
ders and 36 other felonies in the string of "Night
Stalker" slayings that terrorized Californians last
year.
Municipal Court Judge James Nelson also
found probable cause for special circumstances
alleged in all 14 slayings. a finding that could
send Ramirez to California's gas chamber if con
victed.
There was no outward emotion expressed by
Ramirez, who once startled court spectators by

flashing a pentagram on his palm and proclaim
ing "Hail, Satan."
Superior Court arraignment was scheduled for
May 21, and Ramirez was ordered to remain in
custody without bail.
Ramirez had been charged with 14 murders
and 54 other felonies in Los Angeles County, but
Halpin asked that 18 counts be dropped because
evidence had not been presented on them.
The 36 counts in addition to murder that
Ramirez faces include burglary, attempted mur
der, robbery, rape, sodomy and oral copulation.
Three counts of kidnapping were among the
counts prosecutors asked to be dismissed.
The preliminary hearing, in its ninth week,
ended swiftly when both the prosecution and
defense declined to give closing statements and
the judge immediately issued his ruling.
Weather 'tis nobler. . .
Sunny, breezy and a little warmer today with
highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s. Fair and
warmer tonight and tomorrow.
