# Farm issues AIDS policy
## Believed to be a first for a U.S. university 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Stanford has issued an official policy statement clarify
ing its employment practices that protect University per
sonnel with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS) from discrimination.
According to University Personnel Director Rob
Parker, the statement, believed to be the first of its kind at
a U.S. university, guarantees privacy for faculty, staff and
students seeking employment here. In particular, it
specifies that applicants diagnosed with AIDS, AlDS
related complex (ARC) or suspected of being in a high
risk category may not have that information used against
them in the hiring process.
— ""'ft reinfofcesli set of principles and values that Stan
ford has already had in place about non-discrimination,"
Parker said. "I think that having a specific statement does
represent some leadership on the part of Stanford, and
I'm pleased that Stanford is willing to be clear and un
equivocal in its position."
According to the statement, "Because there is no
evidence that the AIDS virus can be transmitted via work
relationships, Stanford will not:
• Ask applicants for employment if they have AIDS,
ARC, the AIDS virus or if they are a member of a high
risk group.
• Make a hiring decision based on the suspicion that a
person has AIDS, ARC, the virus or that person is a
member of a high risk group.
• Require anyone to take a test for the AIDS virus as a
condition of employment."

Although the University does not have statistics reveal
ing how many employees have AIDS or may be carrying
the virus, Parker said five AIDS-related deaths have been
reported among faculty and staff during the last two years.
The statement, published in a new pamphlet, "AIDS in
the Workplace: Guidelines for Stanford University," was
approved in principle by the University Administrative
Council in January, Parker said.
The council is a committee of the Stanford's top admi
nistrators, including University President Donald Ken
nedy. Kennedy was out of town yesterday and unavailable
for comment.
Although he called the publication of the policy during
Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week (GALA) a "nice coin
cidence," Parker said the delay was due to several revi
sions in the policy since its initial approval.
The policy amplifies Stanford's commitment to fair
hiring policies based on merit rather than factors which
are not related to job performance, Parker said.
"Part of that is to underscore the importance of privacy
in the decision (of) the individual and to make the point
that we're really trying to treat this like any other situation
where there is a disabling disease," he said. "The key
question is whether or not the person can perform the job.
"With all the talk about testing, we want to be clear that
Stanford is not proposing and not contemplating any kind
of testing for the virus as a condition of employment,"
Parker said. Such testing has been proposed by branches
of the U.S. armed forces.
In preparing the statement, the University consulted
with Stanford physicians and AIDS
experts around the country to
compile medical information relevant
to an employment policy.
Although special guidelines and
recommendations have been pro
vided to the University medical
workers who might come in direct
contact with blood from persons in
fected by the AIDS virus, the state
ment said Stanford has concluded
that "there is no known risk of trans
mission of the AIDS virus in work
settings such as exist in the Univer
sity."
The statement further maintains
that because the AIDS virus is not
transmitted in normal work settings,
University employees do not have the
right to request reassignment on the
grounds that they might contract the
disease from co-workers.
"Special importance in dealing
with (AIDS) in the workplace is to
underscore the fact that it is not
transmitted by casual contact,"
Parker said.
The statement also provides a list
of resources both within and outside
the University that can provide coun
seling and information on AlDS
related employment and medical in
formation.
