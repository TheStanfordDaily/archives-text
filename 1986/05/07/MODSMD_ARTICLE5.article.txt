## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night issued
censures and reprimands to individuals in
volved in last month's spring elections
who were found in violation of rules
governing elections procedures.
At its meeting in the Law School, the
senate also approved the election of two
write-in candidates as graduate senators
and certified final election results.
Censures were issued to Slate of Shock,
which won the race for senior class presi
dents, and to senior Robby Perkins, who
was accused of bribing graduate senate

candidate Zenon Kuc. Hearings Officer
Jim McGrath described a censure as a
"written statement acknowledging a viola
tion (of elections procedures) and saying
the violation is wrong."
According to the hearings committee,
Perkins offered to buy Kuc a Sunday Flicks
pass after Kuc told him at a Daily Editorial
Board endorsement interview that his
main interest in running for senate was to
gain free admission to the movies. Flicks
passes are complimentary for senators.
"Robby offered to buy Zenon a Flicks
pass due to his belief that only individuals
seriously concerned about the issues
should run for office," the committee

report said. McGrath told the senate hi?
concern was based on Perkins' intention to
offer Kuc money in exchange for a promise
not to run for senate.
Because the Slate of Shock exceeded the
specified campaign budget of $100 by 40
percent, the senate issued a censure
"because they overspent their limit." The
senate chose not to disqualify the slate be
cause its overspending "had no effect on
the outcome of the election," according to
the hearing committee.
During the hearings, slate member B.G.
Porter contended Slate of Shock members
were unaware they were required to report
money spent on such things as buying and

developing film for pictures on fliers.
Graduate write-in candidates Bill Lowry
and Bob Griffin, who ran in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, were added to
the list of next years graduate senators last
night. According to Elections Commis
sioner Robin Miller, Lowry and Griffin's
certification was delayed because their
declarations of intent to run for senate
were filed late.
In other business, Financial Manager
Duncan Weaver clarified divestment pro
cedures, reiterating that student groups
with interest-bearing accounts can choose
to remain in the University's Expendable
Funds Pool.
