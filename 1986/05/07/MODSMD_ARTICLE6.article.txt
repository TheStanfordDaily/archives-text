# Lecturer testifies on Soviet accident

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A Stanford lecturer who has been advis
ing Soviet officials on methods of combat
ting radiation from the smoldering Cher
nobyl nuclear reactor told a state
environmental board yesterday that the
accident is likely to have longterm medical,
environmental and political consequences
for the Soviet Union.
"The bottom line here is that consider
able (radioactive) material was lofted by
the explosion, much or most of it fell
within the Soviet Union, and the rest will
sprinkle (other countries) for months or

years to come," Peter Faulkner said in tes
timony before the state Assembly's Com
mittee on Environment Safety and Toxic
Materials in Sacramento.
Faulkner, a lecturer on nuclear weapons
and power for the Innovative Academic
Courses program here and a consultant to
several environmental organizations, was
asked by officials at the Soviet Consulate
General in San Francisco last Wednesday
for advice on extinguishing a graphite fire
at the plant, which probably exploded on
April 24 or 25 because of a cooling system
failure.
Faulkner said he met with the Soviet
vice consul four times last Wednesday,

Thursday and Friday and advised him that
the Soviets should use nitrogen to extin
guish the fire.
"I am happy to report that meetings be
tween U.S. scientists and Soviet represen
tatives were very cordial and (laid) the
groundwork for continued assistance, pro
vided the Soviets respond to U.S. queries
promptly, providing accurate data," he
told the committee.
The accident could result in increased
sickness and birth defect rates during the
next several years, a costly clean-up pro
gram and damaged relations with other
European countries, said Faulkner, a
former engineer with the Nuclear Services

Corp., a firm responsible for developing
safety plans for nuclear plants.
Faulkner said the Soviet Union's esti
mate that between two and 20 people have
died as a result of the Chernobyl accident
means there could be five to 10 times as
many with serious burns and acute radia
tion sickness. He added that those living
near the crippled reactor may suffer the
consequences for many years to come.
"The population at risk exceeds 50 mil
lion people."' Faulkner said. "Most of
these will escape unharmed, but long-lived
decay products will certainly affect future
generations with disease and genetic
mutation. . . . Their numbers will
roughly decrease with distance from
the site."
Faulkner cautioned, however, that
no accurate prediction can be made
until it is known how much time
passed between the point the reactor
was shut off and the time it exploded.
Cleaning up the Chernobyl plant
and surrounding area will cost some
where between 10 and 100 times the
$2 billion spent on cJean-up following
the Three Mile Island accident in
Pennsylvania.
"These costs include rehabilitating
damaged land and removing agricul
tural products exposed to radioactiv
ity," he said.
He added that the accident is likely
to be damaging to the Soviet Union
politically and technologically.
"Accompanying the erosion of re
lations with Eastern Europe and
Scandinavia (where radioactive ma
terial was carried by wind from the
accident site), the Soviets are certain
to suffer low confidence in their reac
tor designs — past, present and future
— and confirmation of suspicions
they are not competent producers of
high-tech and that their quality as
surance controls are inadequate,"
Faulkner said.

He added that it is too early to
draw connections between the Cher
nobyl accident and similar reactor in
the United States, but said experts
hope for some changes nationally and
internationally. According to
Faulkner, their suggestions include:
• staff expansion and a large funding
increase at the International Atomic
Energy Agency in Vienna;
• creation of a strong system of third
party inspections of nuclear plant
staffs, operating procedures and con
struction;
• allowing the public as well as
federal and state regulators access to
inspection result*:
• tabling proposed legislation that
would reduce the safety zones around
plants and make it easier for nuclear
plants to receive licenses; and
• listening to the valuable contribu
tions of the critics of nuclear power.
