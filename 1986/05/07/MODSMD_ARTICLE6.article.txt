### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
A Stanford lecturer who has been advis
ing Soviet officials on methods of combat
ting radiation from the smoldering Cher
nobyl nuclear reactor told a state
environmental board yesterday that the
accident is likely to have longterm medical,
environmental and political consequences
for the Soviet Union.
"The bottom line here is that consider
able (radioactive) material was lofted by
the explosion, much or most of it fell
within the Soviet Union, and the rest will
sprinkle (other countries) for months or

years to come," Peter Faulkner said in tes
timony before the state Assembly's Com
mittee on Environment Safety and Toxic
Materials in Sacramento.
Faulkner, a lecturer on nuclear weapons
and power for the Innovative Academic
Courses program here and a consultant to
several environmental organizations, was
asked by officials at the Soviet Consulate
General in San Francisco last Wednesday
for advice on extinguishing a graphite fire
at the plant, which probably exploded on
April 24 or 25 because of a cooling system
failure.
Faulkner said he met with the Soviet
vice consul four times last Wednesday,

Thursday and Friday and advised him that
the Soviets should use nitrogen to extin
guish the fire.
"I am happy to report that meetings be
tween U.S. scientists and Soviet represen
tatives were very cordial and (laid) the
groundwork for continued assistance, pro
vided the Soviets respond to U.S. queries
promptly, providing accurate data," he
told the committee.
The accident could result in increased
sickness and birth defect rates during the
next several years, a costly clean-up pro
gram and damaged relations with other
European countries, said Faulkner, a
former engineer with the Nuclear Services

Corp., a firm responsible for developing
safety plans for nuclear plants.
Faulkner said the Soviet Union's esti
mate that between two and 20 people have
died as a result of the Chernobyl accident
means there could be five to 10 times as
many with serious burns and acute radia
tion sickness. He added that those living
near the crippled reactor may suffer the
consequences for many years to come.
"The population at risk exceeds 50 mil
lion people."' Faulkner said. "Most of
these will escape unharmed, but long-lived
decay products will certainly affect future
