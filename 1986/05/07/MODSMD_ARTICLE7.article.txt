Even though Walter McDougall won a Pulitzer Prize
last month for his book on politics and history in the
space age, he says he doesn't see himself as a "space
expert."
McDougall, an associate professor of history at UC-
Berkeley who is presently a visiting scholar at the
Hoover Institution, won the Pulitzer Prize in history

Feature

for his book ". . . The Heavens and the Earth: A Politi
cal History of the Space Age."
Although McDougall's main field of study is
diplomatic history, he said he has always been inter
ested in the space program and"the way international
competition stimulates technological change."
Technology is underappreciated by historians in po
litical and social history, McDougall said.
"As a historian I became interested in international
law for non-territorial regions, such as the law of the
sea, Antarctica and outer space. I wanted to know how
sovereign nations manage these regions that don't
belong to anyone," he said.
In his book, McDougall cites the launching of the
Russian satellite Sputnik as one of the events that had
significant influence on our space program and our re
lationship with the Soviet Union.
