### FELICIA PAIK Senior staff writer 
Even though Walter McDougall won a Pulitzer Prize
last month for his book on politics and history in the
space age, he says he doesn't see himself as a "space
expert."
McDougall, an associate professor of history at UC-
Berkeley who is presently a visiting scholar at the
Hoover Institution, won the Pulitzer Prize in history

Feature

for his book ". . . The Heavens and the Earth: A Politi
cal History of the Space Age."
Although McDougall's main field of study is
diplomatic history, he said he has always been inter
ested in the space program and"the way international
competition stimulates technological change."
Technology is underappreciated by historians in po
litical and social history, McDougall said.
"As a historian I became interested in international
law for non-territorial regions, such as the law of the
sea, Antarctica and outer space. I wanted to know how
sovereign nations manage these regions that don't
belong to anyone," he said.
In his book, McDougall cites the launching of the
Russian satellite Sputnik as one of the events that had
significant influence on our space program and our re
lationship with the Soviet Union.
"That first satellite shocked
the U.S." and triggered a lot of
space-related research,
McDougall said.
McDougall said he ap
preciates the honor of the
Pulitzer and called the award a
"complete surprise."
However, he also said he
hopes that the publicity sur
rounding his prize-winning
book will not classify him as a
"space expert." He said he
wants to continue in his field of
international relations.
McDougall already has a
new project that he is research
ing at Hoover. He has been
asked to write an entry for the
new edition of the En
cyclopaedia Britannica.
"I have been asked to write
about the diplomatic history of
the 20th century from start to
finish," McDougall said. "It
will probably be a 500-page
manuscript, and I have until
Jan. 1, 1988 to complete the
project."
"It is an honor to be asked
(to write an entry)," he added.
"I'm in the middle of my
career, so this will be good time
to master my field of interest â€”
which will help my future
teaching and research."
