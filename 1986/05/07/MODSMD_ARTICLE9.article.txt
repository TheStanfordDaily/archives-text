# Speakers say Israel supports apartheid
## Critics in audience dispute charges 
### STUART BLOCK Staff writer 
"Israel is South Africa's closest
strategic ally, and (Israel's) role has
begun to pose difficult questions,"
Cynthia Bonta of the November 29
Coalition for Palestine told a small
but lively audience last night in His
tory Corner.
Joining Bonta in the discussion was
Themba Ntinga, a member of the
African National Congress, who
charged that "both South Africa and
Israel practice racism (by) protecting
the identity and governing power of
certain types of people, (and show) a
lack of consideration for the rights of
the indigenous people."
Ntinga further suggested that the
two nations were driven together by
the "tenacity of forces of im
perialism" and have remained to
gether as the result of "bonds of
friendship (formed by) fear and isola
tion."
The speeches of both Ntinga and
Rnnta were truncated several times

by what Bonta termed "Israeli
apologists and Israeli defenders" who
interrupted the presentation to con
test what they said were the "lies"
and "undocumented facts" suggested
by the speakers.
Through the interruptions, Ntinga
and Bonta stressed that Israel has ex
tensive political and "ideological"
ties to the apartheid regime of South
Africa with manifestations that are
not only monetary, but also military.
In justifying their claims the two
cited what they called "Israeli
(laundering) of South African exports
to Europe and the United States to
escape imposed boycotts and tariffs,
(and) the joint testing of nuclear
devices (which have led) to South
Africa's obtainment of tactical nu
clear weapons."
"The issue of Israel is intertwined
in the problem of South Africa,"
Ntinga stated. "That is what we want
people to realize. Our opposition is
not (to) the people of the lands, but
to the powers which control them."
