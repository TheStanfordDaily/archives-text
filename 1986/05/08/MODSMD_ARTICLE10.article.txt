### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
Jeff Soukup, a co-term student in
international policy studies and inter
national relations, was elected the
new senate chair in a special ASSU
meeting last night.
Soukup sees his main role as a
"spokesman" for the student body
and "promises to represent them. ...
I have a responsibility to ensure their
(the students') views are heard,
regardless of my personal views."
Soukup hopes to represent more
adequately graduate students, as well.
Graduate students are an integral

part ot the student body, Soukup
said. As a co-term student "it is im
portant that we have leadership.. ..
The ASSU should not be an under
graduate club."
Soukup has been a senator for two
years and is currently co-chair of the
Budget and Finance Committee. He
defeated David Porter in the race.
Soukup has tremendous hopes for
next year's senate, saying that "the
ASSU can really do something if the
right people are leading it, and it is
not caught up in petty rules."
However, Soukup readily admits
that there are changes that should be
enacted.

He would like to see the funding
process "streamlined." The ASSU
would fund specific programs rather
than the student group itself, a pro
posal originated by current ASSU
Chair Carey White and senate mem
ber Jim De La Hunt. "This proposal
might encourage student groups to go
into programs with other groups.
Soukup said.
Soukup also wants to initiate discus
sion to revamp the Western Culture
program, believing it to be
"ethnocentric and chauvinistic."
Using the Great Works track as an
example, Soukup said there must be
many other great contributions to

philosophy and history besides
Rome. Greece and Western Europe.
Another area of concern for
Soukup is "homophobia on campus."
He hopes to "prod" the University to
come up with some type of
"informing" policy about homo
phobia on campus. He said that stu
dents "never tolerate blatant racism
or sexist acts," yet rarely speak out
about homophobic sentiments.
Soukup also said the students
should play a more active role in the
Tresidder Union renovations. "A
great deal more student input is re
quired,' he said, adding that he hopes
the ASSU can bring it about.
