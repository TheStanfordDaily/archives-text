# Stanford to help alcohol patients
## 
### FELICIA PAIK Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Alcohol and Drug Treatment Cen
ter, which opens next week, will focus on helping
addicted patients without requiring hospital stays.
"We will be offering highly individualized and
structured outpatient services. We want to reduce
the length of stay in a hospital," said Bob Matano,
director of services at the center.
The center will offer three levels of treatment:

acute care, long-term care and a structured out
patient services program, Matano said.
The length of in-patient hospitalization will be de
termined by individual patient needs, unlike the
programs at some facilities that have requirements
of 28- to 30-day stays, according to Matano.
Out-patient counseling is not only a flexible
method of treatment, but also a less expensive one
for the patient.
"There is a definite societal need for this type of
treatment. One out of every 10 Americans suffers

from alcoholism." said Carole Price, hospital asso
ciate director and the liaison between the hospital
and the new center.
"There is a need for this center (here at Stan
ford) since Silicon Valley is close by; it is a high -
stress environment which causes alcohol and drug
abuse." Price said.
"We will have a multidisciplinary staff â€”
physicians, psychiatrists, family therapists and drug
counselors," Matano said.
