# Opinions
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Attend forum tomorrow 
### 
Have you ever wondered how decisions are made at
this University? How much say should students have in
determining the structure of their education, the or
ganization of the University? Why Stanford doesn't
divest? What are the problems between the United
Stanford Workers and the administration? Why do we
have distribution requirements, anyway?
Well, now you have the chance to ask those ques
tions and receive some answers. Tomorrow, from 7 to
9 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium, there will be a forum
entitled, "Toward a More Responsive Stanford:
Perspectives on Governance and Decision Making." It
will be devoted to the discussion of such issues. As part
of this unprecedented event, students, faculty,
workers, staff and administration officials will present
their concerns about the decision-making process at
Stanford and will be available for questioning.
An opportunity like this is long overdue. In the fall,
the UniteH Stanford Workers requested a forum of this

type in order to discuss and clarify for the community
the issues surrounding the contract negotiations be
tween the University and the union. The University,
however, refused to participate.
The University has also managed to side-step
various other issues relating to questions of governance
and community control. These include its policies
toward fraternities, its investment policy and its rela
tionship with the Hoover Institution. We hope that this
forum represents a movement toward a more ac
countable administration; toward the opening of more
communication channels between various sectors of
the University; toward more constructive dialogue.
So go to Cubberley tomorrow night, listen to what
the forum panelists have to say and ask your questions.
Now is the time to voice your opinion. Stanford cannot
become more responsive without your participation
and input.
