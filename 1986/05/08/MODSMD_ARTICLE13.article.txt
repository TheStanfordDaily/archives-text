Science confused
with technology
I am writing in response to a fallacy
which commonly appears in this
paper, well exemplified by a letter
from French Prof. Robert Cohn
entitled "Pitfalls of science" (Daily,
May 5). I am particularly distressed
that in this instance it was a Stanford
professor confounding an important
semantic issue — the rampant confu
sion of science with technology.
Science, loosely defined, is the use
of the scientific method to the ends of
discovering the workings of our uni
verse. It is technology and engineer
ing, the application of scientific
knowledge to productive ends, that
create the "gadgets" of which Cohn
writes so fearfully in his letter.
He cites the recent space shuttle
and nuclear power plant disasters as
examples of how "it is excessive
belief in science . . . that is danger
ous" or how "some people will never
learn about judgment," as they
"believe frantically in numbers,
gadgets and the ability to control life
with science . .. Science does not
seek to control, or for that matter to
even produce the means for control
ling, lives. It is those who control the
application of science who are re
sponsible for the plethora of gadgets
that inundate our lives.
More specifically Cohn writes of
the evidence that the Challenger
space shuttle and Chernobyl nuclear
accidents were caused by "flimsy o
rings" and "flimsy cooling pipes" in
backing his dour claims. What the
professor fails to distinguish is that
scientists do not design and
manufacture o-rings and cooling
pipes — engineers and technocrats
do. Scientists merely discover the
properties of atoms and molecules, or
create the theories of stresses and
heat capacities that allow engineers to
manipulate rubber and metal to make
these o-rings and cooling pipes. Sci
ence trades in knowledge, while tech
nology trades in production.
Moreover, engineers are only
peripherally culpable for runaway
technology. They are most often sub
ject to the whims of market forces
and managers who have the final say
in whether a particular o-ring is
suitable or whether it is cost-effective
to build a more elaborate contain
ment vessel for a nuclear pile. These
are the people who spent more of
their college careers, as Cohn adv
ocates, reading Baudelaire and Poe
rather than calculus and ther
modynamics.
This lack of distinction between

technology and science is no mere
peccadillo of semantics. Such ignor
ance is rampant, particularly among
those who legislate and thus control
the future of science. We cannot quell
our instinctive need to know, no more
than we can regress to some idyllic
hunter-gatherer society; science is an
indelible part of our collective being.
Can we aifford to have such mass ig
norance of what science even is?

Set-aside program
redresses inequity
There has been considerable dis
cussion in Washington about federal
"set-aside" programs, in which a
small portion of contracts is supposed
to be reserved for minority busi
nesses. The U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights, to no one's surprise, including
its chairman Clarence Pendleton (of
recent Doonesbury fame), is opposed
to the program.
I really see nothing wrong with at
tempting to set aside formally for a
part of the population the same kind
of benefits that historically have been
set aside informally for others. I think
it is fair to say that the likes of Mi
chael Deaver and his clients are the
beneficiaries of set-asides. I think it is
fair to say that U.S. defense contrac
tors, many of which do not pay taxes,
are the beneficiaries of set-asides, as
they lobby for a strong national
defense as sole-source contractors.
The use of an "eligible" bidders list
is, in a sense, another form of set
aside, and is used extensively
throughout the country in public and
private sectors. I think it is fair to say
that majority contractors have been
beneficiaries of set-asides by
majorities over the years. The federal
government's program merely ack
nowledges these practices by at
tempting to assist those not
heretofore favored.
What is an interesting aside in this
episode is the so-called independence
of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights. Shortly after Reagan was
rightfully cited for stacking the Com
mission with those of his own ideol
ogy, Pendleton proclaimed the
sovereignty of the Commission.
When the Reagan Administration,
however, spoke out in support of set
asides, Pendleton belly-ached that
the Administration was deserting him
— not the voice of one projecting
himself to be independent What is
also interesting is that Reagan was

persuaded by a black conservative (a
real oxymoron) within the White
House to support set-asides. Strange,
but beautiful.

Frat expulsion is
useless vengeance
The wrath of the administration
had been awoken — the sword has
been drawn and can be sheathed
again only after it has drawn blood. A
scapegoat is needed, and so Residen
tial Education decides to vanquish
the Delta Upsilon fraternity.
The supposed reason for the expul
sion is the same as that for previous
such actions: punishment for lack of
discipline (like the Zetes, the Theta
Delts five years ago, etc.). More spe
cifically, vengeance for sins against
that holy of holies, the Office of Resi
dential Education; an office incapa
ble of acting out of any motive but
that of vengeance.
Vengeance is a concept rooted in
the Old Testament. Vengeance is
sweet and quick, but it is the action of
the child, appropriate to mankind in
its youth. It is not appropriate among
adults.
A frat sins. It is reprimanded. But
is it reprimanded for its sins, or is it
only made a scapegoat? It is kicked
off campus. To what end? A relative
peace, and then as memory fades an
other house sins and is expelled. And
what is gained by the repetition of
such "justice"? Only the eventual
removal of all frats; punishment until
each man is dead.
But can the death of those it serves
truly be the end of any law? Certainly
not. It is because it cannot that ven
geance yields to mercy in the New
Testament. And so it must at Res Ed.
Res Ed must not wreak vengeance
upon the DUs for their sins, (they will
receive punishment enough after
death, i.e. graduation), but take a
house of the meek and unoffensive, a
house such as Phi Sig, and make a
sacrifice of them. And as the
crucifixion of Christ cleansed all
humanity, the dissolution of Phi Sig
will cleanse all fraternities; it will ab
solve the DUs of their sins, and in
doing so will absolve the sins of all
frats, past and future.
Only by such a ritual can future of
fenses be avoided. And only by such a
ritual can it be ensured that frat life
shall not perish at this University.

defense as sole-source contractors.
The use of an "eligible" bidders list
is, in a sense, another form of set
aside, and is used extensively
throughout the country in public and
private sectors. I think it is fair to say
that majority contractors have been
beneficiaries of set-asides by
majorities over the years. The federal
government's program merely ack
nowledges these practices by at
tempting to assist those not
heretofore favored.
What is an interesting aside in this
episode is the so-called independence
of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights. Shortly after Reagan was
rightfully cited for stacking the Com
mission with those of his own ideol
ogy, Pendleton proclaimed the
sovereignty of the Commission.
When the Reagan Administration,
however, spoke out in support of set
asides, Pendleton belly-ached that
the Administration was deserting him
— not the voice of one projecting
himself to be independent What is
also interesting is that Reagan was

persuaded by a black conservative (a
real oxymoron) within the White
House to support set-asides. Strange,
but beautiful.

Frat expulsion is
useless vengeance
The wrath of the administration
had been awoken — the sword has
been drawn and can be sheathed
again only after it has drawn blood. A
scapegoat is needed, and so Residen
tial Education decides to vanquish
the Delta Upsilon fraternity.
The supposed reason for the expul
sion is the same as that for previous
such actions: punishment for lack of
discipline (like the Zetes, the Theta
Delts five years ago, etc.). More spe
cifically, vengeance for sins against
that holy of holies, the Office of Resi
dential Education; an office incapa
ble of acting out of any motive but
that of vengeance.
Vengeance is a concept rooted in
the Old Testament. Vengeance is
sweet and quick, but it is the action of
the child, appropriate to mankind in
its youth. It is not appropriate among
adults.
A frat sins. It is reprimanded. But
is it reprimanded for its sins, or is it
only made a scapegoat? It is kicked
off campus. To what end? A relative
peace, and then as memory fades an
other house sins and is expelled. And
what is gained by the repetition of
such "justice"? Only the eventual
removal of all frats; punishment until
each man is dead.
But can the death of those it serves
truly be the end of any law? Certainly
not. It is because it cannot that ven
geance yields to mercy in the New
Testament. And so it must at Res Ed.
Res Ed must not wreak vengeance
upon the DUs for their sins, (they will
receive punishment enough after
death, i.e. graduation), but take a
house of the meek and unoffensive, a
house such as Phi Sig, and make a
sacrifice of them. And as the
crucifixion of Christ cleansed all
humanity, the dissolution of Phi Sig
will cleanse all fraternities; it will ab
solve the DUs of their sins, and in
doing so will absolve the sins of all
frats, past and future.
Only by such a ritual can future of
fenses be avoided. And only by such a
ritual can it be ensured that frat life
shall not perish at this University.

Science confused
with technology
I am writing in response to a fallacy
which commonly appears in this
paper, well exemplified by a letter
from French Prof. Robert Cohn
entitled "Pitfalls of science" (Daily,
May 5). I am particularly distressed
that in this instance it was a Stanford
professor confounding an important
semantic issue — the rampant confu
sion of science with technology.
Science, loosely defined, is the use
of the scientific method to the ends of
discovering the workings of our uni
verse. It is technology and engineer
ing, the application of scientific
knowledge to productive ends, that
create the "gadgets" of which Cohn
writes so fearfully in his letter.
He cites the recent space shuttle
and nuclear power plant disasters as
examples of how "it is excessive
belief in science . . . that is danger
ous" or how "some people will never
learn about judgment," as they
"believe frantically in numbers,
gadgets and the ability to control life
with science . .. Science does not
seek to control, or for that matter to
even produce the means for control
ling, lives. It is those who control the
application of science who are re
sponsible for the plethora of gadgets
that inundate our lives.
More specifically Cohn writes of
the evidence that the Challenger
space shuttle and Chernobyl nuclear
accidents were caused by "flimsy o
rings" and "flimsy cooling pipes" in
backing his dour claims. What the
professor fails to distinguish is that
scientists do not design and
manufacture o-rings and cooling
pipes — engineers and technocrats
do. Scientists merely discover the
properties of atoms and molecules, or
create the theories of stresses and
heat capacities that allow engineers to
manipulate rubber and metal to make
these o-rings and cooling pipes. Sci
ence trades in knowledge, while tech
nology trades in production.
Moreover, engineers are only
peripherally culpable for runaway
technology. They are most often sub
ject to the whims of market forces
and managers who have the final say
in whether a particular o-ring is
suitable or whether it is cost-effective
to build a more elaborate contain
ment vessel for a nuclear pile. These
are the people who spent more of
their college careers, as Cohn adv
ocates, reading Baudelaire and Poe
rather than calculus and ther
modynamics.
This lack of distinction between

technology and science is no mere
peccadillo of semantics. Such ignor
ance is rampant, particularly among
those who legislate and thus control
the future of science. We cannot quell
our instinctive need to know, no more
than we can regress to some idyllic
hunter-gatherer society; science is an
indelible part of our collective being.
Can we aifford to have such mass ig
norance of what science even is?

Set-aside program
redresses inequity
There has been considerable dis
cussion in Washington about federal
"set-aside" programs, in which a
small portion of contracts is supposed
to be reserved for minority busi
nesses. The U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights, to no one's surprise, including
its chairman Clarence Pendleton (of
recent Doonesbury fame), is opposed
to the program.
I really see nothing wrong with at
tempting to set aside formally for a
part of the population the same kind
of benefits that historically have been
set aside informally for others. I think
it is fair to say that the likes of Mi
chael Deaver and his clients are the
beneficiaries of set-asides. I think it is
fair to say that U.S. defense contrac
tors, many of which do not pay taxes,
are the beneficiaries of set-asides, as
they lobby for a strong national
defense as sole-source contractors.
