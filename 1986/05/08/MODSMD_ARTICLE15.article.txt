# Poli sci is the real world
## 
### 
I was attracted to political science after discovering I
was no good at it. The complex interrelationships of na
tions and governments, the endless tiers and variegated
functions of bureaucracy proved too much for me. I had
actually been thinking of majoring in poli sci; but when I
threw everything I had into my P.S. 35 final and got a B-,
it became clear that I had no aptitude for the subject.
But a strange belligerence gripped me several days after
I got my grades back, and I walked over to the department
with a funny gleam in my eye. "They cant do this to me,"
I thought. Just to spite the bastards, I went in and
declared.

Poli sci was unlike anything I'd studied in high school.
For one thing, the writing was different. Political science is
encoded, for the most part, in a special argot which is of
ten quite daunting to the uninitiated. The language
employs Latinate constructions which tend to make all the
words roughly the same length, about three-quarters of an
inch long. Most articles require line-by-line decoding.
Of course, the subject matter was different, too. Having
gone to school in Georgia, I had been raised in a tradition
of Southern literature that revolved around violence and
race, blood bonds and secret lusts, a literature fascinated
by lurid passions. Even when the genre was not Southern
Gothic, and we weren't being asked to piece together the
fragmented narratives of some Faulknerian character who
was either obsessed with his family's past or brain
damaged by incest and alcohol, I was able to take refuge
in the polyphony of literature, and could splash around,
deliriously happy, in the limitless, oceanic feelings of the
writing.
Political science brought my splashing to an abrupt halt.
It overwhelmed me, made me feel small, terribly ignorant,
and much too obsessed with flesh-and-blood reality to be
able to grasp something as massive as the movement of
nations. Poli sci depicts a realm in which human beings
have been leeched of whatever personal identity and emo
tional content they'd once had, and have been trans
formed into emblems of a particular government. Poli sci
abjures heated discussion, at least in print. It is highly
paradigmatic. It seems to take the entire great human
reality out there and sanitize it; and when that reality has
been processed by what we loosely call the social sciences,
we are left with models, constructs of predictive and ana
lytical value.
I am not criticizing the discipline; nor do I wish to decry
its heatless detachment or its vivisectionist bent. If any
thing, I'm still a bit awed by those who talk about nations
as if they are chess pieces. In literature, the units of
meaning, the actors, are individuals. In poli sci, an actor is
a nation. Listening to poli sci majors talk, I still catch
myself thinking that "China" is some kind of metaphysical
entity, neither inhabited nor operated by human beings,
imbued with a weird life of its own.

I got into political science by way of P.S. 35, which is as
good a synecdoche as any for the discipline, and probably
has as much impact on the average poli sci student as any
course in the curriculum. You can always tell the people
who've had P.S. 35. They're the ones who compulsively
categorize every argument before they can talk about it:
"Okay, this is your basic, straightforward, domestic
politics argument. . .." The catch-phrases are etched into
their memories for years afterward. Who could forget
America's "Lockean liberal heritage," or Huntington's
"gap between America's ideals and its institutions?"
Part of what hooked me on poli sci was Krasner. The
man strode back and forth across the stage of Cubberly,
hands folded behind his back, lecturing without notes. If
you took down what he said, the information would pour
onto the page in flawless outline form, leaving you with
the illusion that you were a damned genius for taking such
good notes. Krasner was cocky, Krasner was intelligent.
But mainly, it seemed to me, Krasner had a logical and
well-thought-out view of the world. He had done his
homework, and had arrived at satisfying answers, insofar
as it was possible to do so. He had integrated the whole
vast ugly reality of Life into a coherent picture, having
left, it seemed at the time, no stone unturned under which
might have lain an argument that would refute his conclu
sions. I coveted this logic, I longed for this coherence, I
lusted after this certitude.
I was attracted not only by Krasner's mesmerizing con
fidence, but also by the subject matter itself. It seemed so
immediate, yet at the same time had enough scope to be
grandiose and exciting. The issue of nuclear war gave the
subject apocalyptic overtones bordering on the literary.
But there is no room for literary fervor when analyzing
world events.
This became clear on the P.S. 35 final. Oddly, it wasn't
the final itself that broke me, but the last two readings in
the course, Jonathan Schell's "The Fate of the Earth,"
and the reply to Schell by poli sci superstar Theodore
Draper. Schell had written what seemed to me a critique
of nuclear deterrence so devastating as to be un
answerable. He exposed the lunacy of the current nuclear
stalemate with writing as moving as a song, using logic as
simple and lucid as a geometric proof. The only sane thing
to do, he argued, is to disarm completely, bury the weap
ons and have done with it. The terms of war have
changed, and we must change with them. Complete
bilateral disarmament was the only answer. The way
Schell wrote it, it was beautiful. I gulped it down whole.
Of course Draper took it apart. How are you going to do
this? he asked. How much success do you suppose they'll
have with a nuclear freeze movement in Russia? they
going to form pressure groups there? Start picketing the
Kremlin? Start small, Schell had intoned. Form action
groups in your neighborhood. Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone. Draper was right. What a ludicrous
notion. I went into the P.S. 35 exam thoroughly embit
tered, wrote a lengthy and fairly eloquent essay on how
there was no hope for anything and the world had gone
mad, and was given a B- by some TA I'd never met. I
deserved it. This wasn't "Introduction to the Novel," for
God's sake. This was the big time. This was the Real
World. This was Political Science.
