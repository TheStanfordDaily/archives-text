## U.S. must respond to ally's action 
### 
The editorial, "Respect ally's nuke ban," (Daily,
May 5) made some good points, but 1 disagree with
the conclusion that the United States should not
limit joint military activities in response to bans on
U.S. ship visits to New Zealand ports.
Of course. New Zealand has the right to prohibit
any ship from entering its ports, but the United
States must refuse to disclose which ships are

DONALD BROWN

nuclear-powered or carrying nuclear weapons.
Over 40 percent of U.S. ships are nuclear powered.
They normally operate in task forces composed of
both conventional and nuclear-powered ships.
For security and operational reasons, the United
States and most other countries maintain a policy
of "neither confirming nor denying" the presence
of nuclear weapons aboard ships or aircraft.
New Zealand's outspoken Prime Minister David
Lange, the primary proponent of the ban on nu
clear ships, wants the continued security of the U.S.

Naval Fleet. He just wants them to go elsewhere to
find friendly ports. If New Zealand's parliament
enacts laws sanctioning the current policy, the
United States must weigh New Zealand's commit
ment to the 35-year-old alliance. If they are only
willing to make a token commitment to mutual se
curity, what is the extent of U.S. obligations?
It is not an act of coercion to recognize another
country's right of choice. Neither is it prudent to
continue to assume responsibility for the security of
a country which denies even the limited support
provided by visits to its ports.
The choice is New Zealand's to make. This sum
mer, when the New Zealand parliament considers
the proposed legislation which would prohibit all
nuclear-powered ships from entering its ports, it
must understand the costs. The State Department
has warned that such a law would cause the United
States to review its long-standing security obliga
tions to its South Pacific ally. The result could be a
termination of mutual security commitments
agreed to under the Australia, New Zealand and
United States (ANZUS) Treaty of 1951.

Some claim such a course would be counter
productive and too harsh a response toward a
friendly ally. But the issues involved are important
and the precedent of this case could have a far
reaching impact. Acceptance of such restrictions by
the United States could lead to restrictions on the
operational flexibility of U.S. ships, not just in the
South Pacific, but in other parts of Asia and in
Europe as well.
The United States should be prepared to propose
separate agreements with New Zealand and
Australia to replace the current ANZUS Treaty. A
treaty of friendship, trade and continued bilateral
cooperation might be negotiated with New
Zealand. A similar bilateral treaty, containing the
mutual security provisions of the present ANZUS
Treaty, could be signed with Australia.
The ball is still in New Zealand's court, but it's
time for the United States to prepare a new game
plan.
