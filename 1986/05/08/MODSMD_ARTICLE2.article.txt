# University rips Davies' charges
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
The University's chief lawyer and
the chairman of the History Depart
ment yesterday attacked visiting his
tory Prof. Norman Davies' $3 million
suit claiming Stanford unfairly denied
him a tenured professorship in Janu
ary.
"There is no merit to the suit, nor
to the pernicious notions that if one's
work is not deemed sufficient to merit
appointment, one is defamed; that if
one is denied an appointment one
had hoped for, one's rights had been
infringed," John Schwartz, University
vice president and general counsel,
said in a statement yesterday.
Davies, a prominent expert on the
history of Poland and director of
Stanford's new overseas program in
Krakow, filed the suit in Santa Clara
County Superior Court last Monday
against History Prof. Harold Kahn
and 30 other members of the depart
ment for what he charges was their
role in denying him a vacant endowed
position in Eastern European studies.
He was denied the position by a 12-
11 vote for what many have inter
preted as anti-Semitic material in a
recent book.
History Department Chairman
Paul Robinson yesterday said Davies
has no basis for a suit against the de
partment.
" Based on everything I've seen and
heard about the case thus far, the
complaint is without merit," Robin
son said. "The History Department's
deliberations concerning Prof.
Davies' proposed appointment were
at all times professional and sub
stantive. I am mystified as to why
Prof. Kahn should have been named
as a defendant."

Davies last night refused to com
ment on the details of the suit but said
he had hoped to resolve the conflict
without resorting to a suit. And, once
he filed it he wanted to avoid
publicizing the issue, he said.
"I'm only sorry the University ex
tended public attention by issuing
press releases," Davies said. "1 have
been extremely reluctant to take legal
advice and let the suit be filed, I only
opted for that after being told that I
don't qualify for Stanford's official
policy of inquiry and redress."
Former Republican Congressman
Pete McCloskey, who will represent
Davies, said last night the professor is
seeking $1.5 million for loss of
income and $1.5 million for damage
to reputation. The total includes
$100,000 in damages against each
defendant, he said, stressing that the
suit is not against the University.
McCloskey said, however, he is
hopeful Davies and the University
will settle the issue without resorting
to the courts.
According to McCloskey, Univer
sity Provost James Rosse has said
Davies has no recourse to the stan
dard grievance procedure because he
is a visiting professor and not a mem
ber of the Stanford Academic Coun
cil. However, Rosse has offered to
review the case as a matter of cour
tesy, and Davies is hopeful that the
University will reverse the decision,
McCloskey said.
An earlier report by the Provost's
Office indicated that Davies was
denied the position because some
Jewish members of the History De
partment objected to material in one
chapter of his book, "God's Play
ground: A History of Poland," Mc-
