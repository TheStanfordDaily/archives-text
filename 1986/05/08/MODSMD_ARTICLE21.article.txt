## Stanford breezes by Gaels Wassenaar pulled after 7 no-hit innings in lopsided win 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
MO RAG A — Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess decided that seven
innings of work was enough for his
starting pitcher, Rob Wassenaar.
Seven innings, no mas.
Marquess trotted freshman Pete
Salmon out to the mound to pitch the
eighth inning against the St. Mary's
Gaels and wrap up what turned out to
he a 14-3 Stanford rout.
It wasn't that Wassenaar was in
trouble — Stanford had the game
well in hand at that point, up 11-0. Or
that he was tiring — the right-hander,
who was a tad wild with his breaking
pitches in the early going, consistently
threw the curveball for strikes in the
sixth and seventh frames.
No, things were going just fine,
thank you.
Marquess yanked Wassenaar when
the junior from Edina, Minn., was
working on a gem. Wassenaar hadn't
allowed a hit through his seven in
nings of work.
In fact, he had faced the minimum
number of batters, 2 I. Only one Gael
reached base — Bruce Jansen, who
drew a walk in the fourth — and he
was erased when the next batter
bounced into a double play.
"We're going to need Wasy
(Wassenaar) this weekend (in a
three-game league series with Cali
fornia)," Marquess said about his
decision. "We put a 75-pitch limit on
him before the game, and that's how
many he threw."
No more, no less. Wassenaar
finished with 75 pitches on the but
ton. He also finished six outs away
from glory.
St. Mary's Miles Willis spoiled the
team's no-hit bid when he blooped a
double to right-center off Salmon
with one out in the eighth.
"Coach said, 'We're going to let you
have a certain number of pitches,' "
Wassenaar said. "That's his decision;
that's what coaches are for."
The Gaels hit only two balls hard
all afternoon off Wassenaar — both

Although Mark Machtolf is known primarily for his defense, his biggest contribution to Stanford's 14-3 win
over St. Marv's yesterday came with his bat. Machtolf had two hits, including a two-run opposite-field homer
as the Cardinal upped its record to 33-20.
