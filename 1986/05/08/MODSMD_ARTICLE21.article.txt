## Stanford breezes by Gaels Wassenaar pulled after 7 no-hit innings in lopsided win 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
MO RAG A — Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess decided that seven
innings of work was enough for his
starting pitcher, Rob Wassenaar.
Seven innings, no mas.
Marquess trotted freshman Pete
Salmon out to the mound to pitch the
eighth inning against the St. Mary's
Gaels and wrap up what turned out to
he a 14-3 Stanford rout.
It wasn't that Wassenaar was in
trouble — Stanford had the game
well in hand at that point, up 11-0. Or
that he was tiring — the right-hander,
who was a tad wild with his breaking
pitches in the early going, consistently
threw the curveball for strikes in the
sixth and seventh frames.
No, things were going just fine,
thank you.
Marquess yanked Wassenaar when
the junior from Edina, Minn., was
working on a gem. Wassenaar hadn't
allowed a hit through his seven in
nings of work.
In fact, he had faced the minimum
number of batters, 2 I. Only one Gael
reached base — Bruce Jansen, who
drew a walk in the fourth — and he
was erased when the next batter
bounced into a double play.
"We're going to need Wasy
(Wassenaar) this weekend (in a
three-game league series with Cali
fornia)," Marquess said about his
decision. "We put a 75-pitch limit on
him before the game, and that's how
many he threw."
No more, no less. Wassenaar
finished with 75 pitches on the but
ton. He also finished six outs away
from glory.
St. Mary's Miles Willis spoiled the
team's no-hit bid when he blooped a
double to right-center off Salmon
with one out in the eighth.
"Coach said, 'We're going to let you
have a certain number of pitches,' "
Wassenaar said. "That's his decision;
that's what coaches are for."
The Gaels hit only two balls hard
all afternoon off Wassenaar — both

Although Mark Machtolf is known primarily for his defense, his biggest contribution to Stanford's 14-3 win
over St. Marv's yesterday came with his bat. Machtolf had two hits, including a two-run opposite-field homer
as the Cardinal upped its record to 33-20.
in the first inning. Walt Harris caught
Jansen's dnve to left to start the in
ning, then scooted into the gap in left
center to snare Eric Lakin's two-out
drive to the warning track.
"I got a couple of pitches up in that
inning," admitted Wassenaar, whose
record improved to 6-1. "They hit
them well but luckily not well
enough."
After that it was clear sailing. St.
Mary's managed to get only five balls
out of the infield against Wassenaar,
who struck out four along the way.
Waasenaar took a no-hitter into
the eighth inning against San Jose
State last year before giving up a base
hit.
"Even though I threw mostly

fastballs today," Wassenaar said, "I
was able to throw the curveball for
strikes when 1 had to. I had good con
trol of my four pitches (fastball, cur
veball, slider and changeup)."

Stanford gave Wassenaar plenty to
work with in the top of the first.
Fete Kaukis, the Gaels* starter, and
Scott Hayes together walked six hat
ters in the frame. Throw in Mark
Davis' RBI double, Toi Cook's single
and Ed Sprague's two-run single and.
presto, that's seven runs.
It didn't stop there. In the second.
Frank Carey, Stanford's freshman
shortstop, belted a fastball from Dave
Halligan over the right-field fence for
his first collegiate home run, a three
run shot to boost the score to 10-0.
"It's about time," said Carey, who
had gone 137 plate appearances with
out a long ball. "I'm not a home run
hitter, but if you've got that many at
bats, you've got to get a hold of one."
Carey, who had five RBI on the
day, struck again in the top of the
ninth. A left-handed hitter, Carey
sliced a sinking line-drive double to

Lett-center to score Fred Laningham
from second.
Mark Machtolf, the next batter,
finished Stanford's scoring with an
opposite-field, two-run home run to
right. It was Machtolfs second home
run ol the year and his first in nearly
three months.
Salmon and Steve Zuercher, two
freshman righties making their Stan
lord debuts, stumbled through the
final two innings for the Cardinal.
Salmon walked a pair, giving up two
hits and two runs in his one frame.
Zuercher coughed up a run-scoring
single in the ninth.

Although Mark Machtolf is known primarily for his defense, his biggest contribution to Stanford's 14-3 win
over St. Marv's yesterday came with his bat. Machtolf had two hits, including a two-run opposite-field homer
as the Cardinal upped its record to 33-20.
in the first inning. Walt Harris caught
Jansen's dnve to left to start the in
ning, then scooted into the gap in left
center to snare Eric Lakin's two-out
drive to the warning track.
"I got a couple of pitches up in that
inning," admitted Wassenaar, whose
record improved to 6-1. "They hit
them well but luckily not well
enough."
After that it was clear sailing. St.
Mary's managed to get only five balls
out of the infield against Wassenaar,
who struck out four along the way.
Waasenaar took a no-hitter into
the eighth inning against San Jose
State last year before giving up a base
hit.
"Even though I threw mostly

fastballs today," Wassenaar said, "I
was able to throw the curveball for
strikes when 1 had to. I had good con
trol of my four pitches (fastball, cur
veball, slider and changeup)."

Stanford gave Wassenaar plenty to
work with in the top of the first.
Fete Kaukis, the Gaels* starter, and
Scott Hayes together walked six hat
ters in the frame. Throw in Mark
Davis' RBI double, Toi Cook's single
and Ed Sprague's two-run single and.
presto, that's seven runs.
It didn't stop there. In the second.
Frank Carey, Stanford's freshman
shortstop, belted a fastball from Dave
Halligan over the right-field fence for
his first collegiate home run, a three
run shot to boost the score to 10-0.
"It's about time," said Carey, who
had gone 137 plate appearances with
out a long ball. "I'm not a home run
hitter, but if you've got that many at
bats, you've got to get a hold of one."
Carey, who had five RBI on the
day, struck again in the top of the
ninth. A left-handed hitter, Carey
sliced a sinking line-drive double to

Lett-center to score Fred Laningham
from second.
Mark Machtolf, the next batter,
finished Stanford's scoring with an
opposite-field, two-run home run to
right. It was Machtolfs second home
run ol the year and his first in nearly
three months.
Salmon and Steve Zuercher, two
freshman righties making their Stan
lord debuts, stumbled through the
final two innings for the Cardinal.
Salmon walked a pair, giving up two
hits and two runs in his one frame.
Zuercher coughed up a run-scoring
single in the ninth.

Rob Wassenaar
Seven no-hit innings
MO RAG A — Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess decided that seven
innings of work was enough for his
starting pitcher, Rob Wassenaar.
Seven innings, no mas.
Marquess trotted freshman Pete
Salmon out to the mound to pitch the
eighth inning against the St. Mary's
Gaels and wrap up what turned out to
he a 14-3 Stanford rout.
It wasn't that Wassenaar was in
trouble — Stanford had the game
well in hand at that point, up 11-0. Or
that he was tiring — the right-hander,
who was a tad wild with his breaking
pitches in the early going, consistently
threw the curveball for strikes in the
sixth and seventh frames.
No, things were going just fine,
thank you.
Marquess yanked Wassenaar when
the junior from Edina, Minn., was
working on a gem. Wassenaar hadn't
allowed a hit through his seven in
nings of work.
In fact, he had faced the minimum
number of batters, 2 I. Only one Gael
reached base — Bruce Jansen, who
drew a walk in the fourth — and he
was erased when the next batter
bounced into a double play.
"We're going to need Wasy
(Wassenaar) this weekend (in a
three-game league series with Cali
fornia)," Marquess said about his
decision. "We put a 75-pitch limit on
him before the game, and that's how
many he threw."
No more, no less. Wassenaar
finished with 75 pitches on the but
ton. He also finished six outs away
from glory.
St. Mary's Miles Willis spoiled the
team's no-hit bid when he blooped a
double to right-center off Salmon
with one out in the eighth.
"Coach said, 'We're going to let you
have a certain number of pitches,' "
Wassenaar said. "That's his decision;
that's what coaches are for."
