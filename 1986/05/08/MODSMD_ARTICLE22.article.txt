# Spring football winding down

### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
Stanford football has had a long
and illustrious history of living or
dying by the forward pass. But this
spring, there has been a new of
fensive emphasis on the Farm.
Balance.
"I would like to say that our
strength is balance." Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. "We have
improved our running game. We
now have a better balanced of
fense in terms of the run and the
pass."
After many position changes,
particularly on offense, the overall
feeling of the Cardinal coaches is
one of improvement.
"It's been a good spring," El
way said. "They have had a good
attitude and have worked hard.
We feel good about our spring.'
In order to achieve greater bal
ance, one of Elway's main con
cerns this spring was to improve
the running game. Last season, no
Cardinal running back averaged
more than four yards per carry,
with the cumulative team average
a lowly 2.4 yards per rush.
After some position changes,
with a wealth of talent to choose
from, it looks like Elway has got
ten his wish.
Junior Brad Muster, a second
team All-Pacific 10 Conference
selection a year ago, will lead the
Cardinal ground attack. He was
switched from his customary full
back position to tailback this
spring. He has been the leading
rusher for the Cardinal this spring,
with 119 yards on 29 carries.
"It (the switch) really hasn't
been that much of a difference,"
Muster said. "I'm doing pretty
much the same things."
"Brad is a great all-purpose
back," Elway said. "He has had a
very good spring. We are excited
about his ability for next year."
Muster's move to tailback has

freed up the fullback position for
big backs Marshall Dillard and
Brian Morris. Both are excellent
blockers, with Morris a threat to
catch the ball coming out of the
backfield.
"We think there is a good com
bination with our backs in terms of
size and speed," Elway said.
"We are kind of specializing,"
backup tailback Kevin Scott said.
"We are emphasizing everyone's
strengths."
The Cardinal passing game has
also made important strides this
spring.
John Paye will return for his
senior year as a preseason All-
American and Heisman Trophy
candidate. He is the cornerstone
of the offense.
"John Paye is our team's start
ing point," Elway said. "He is
having a good spring. He is throw
ing the ball with more accuracy."
Paye has thrown for 856 yards
and four touchdowns this spring in
completing 76 of his 101 attempts.
Paye's backup has not yet been
chosen.
"Right now it's Greg Ennis,"
Elway said. "But Mike Kerkorian
has had a good spring. He is a
good competitor and has good arm
strength."
Greater balance has also been
seen in the wide receiver core this
spring. Senior Thomas Henley has
been moved from tailback to wide
receiver this spring to complement
junior Jeff James. Henley snared
30 passes for 208 yards last season
and has caught 10 passes for 219
yards this spring.
"He is really adjusting well,"
Elway said. "We think he has
proven it was a good move. We
have improved our ability to catch
the ball with Henley moving to
wide receiver."
The question mark going into
the spring was the offensive line.
