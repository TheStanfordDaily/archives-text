# Walsworth wins Pac-10 golf, Card places 4th
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Don Walsworth's "finest per
formance in college" netted him
the Pacific 10 Conference individ
ual title and helped the Stanford
men's golf team eliminate a 12-
stroke deficit to finish in a tie for
fourth at the Pac-10 Champion
ships in Simi Valley.
USC captured the team champi
onship by 12 strokes over Oregon,
1,539- 1,551. Arizona State
finished third at 1,557, while the
Cardinal tied with defending con
ference champion UCLA at
1,562.

Walsworth fired a one-under
par 7 I (the only subpar round of
the tournament) at the Wood
Ranch Country Club, coming from
three strokes behind to edge 1985
NCAA Champion Sam Randolph
of USC, 296-297. ASU's Bill
Mayfair finished third at 301.
"This was easily Don's finest
performance in college," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said. "In Sam
Randolph, Don had to defeat the
reigning national champion, one
of the leading amateurs in the
world, and the low amateur at the
recently completed Masters tourn
ament.

With a one-under-par 71 in yesterday's final round, Don
VValsworth won the Pacific 10 Conference individual title.
Walsworth shot the only sub-par round of the tournament to heat
I SC's Sam Randolph by one stroke.
"In order to win," Schaaf added, "Don
needed one of the best rounds of golf that he
could play, and he was equal to the task. The
Pac-10 is a very tough, very competitive confer
ence — and Don is a very worthy champion. I'm
very pleased for him."
Walsworth, a senior from Marceline, Miss.,
shot an even-par 36 on the front nine to catch
Randolph, who shot a 39. When Walsworth
completed the back nine, Randolph was at the
14th, two strokes behind him. Walsworth then
had to wait as Randolph made a furious come
back attempt — which ended as a 12-foot putt
for an eagle on the par-five 18th lipped out.
"I was pretty nervous," Walsworth said. "I
was actually all ready for a playoff. I had been

hitting balls and stuff.
"It feels great, really good," Walsworth said
about winning. "I can't even describe it. I
haven't won a (collegiate) tournament in four
years. ... If I was going to pick one to win that
was it.
"It was kind of nice to end my college career
beating Sam on his home course," he said. "It'll
be something to say 30 years from now. Hope
fully it'll be the start of a few more (wins)."
Walsworth, who won the Missouri Amateur
last summer, is planning on playing amateur
golf again this summer, then turning pro after
the U.S. Amateur Championship in September.
Not to be lost amidst Walsworth's victory is
the importance of Stanford's final round yester
day. The Cardinal needed to beat or tie UCLA
to have a decent chance at an NCAA tourna
ment berth, and it did it by shooting the second
lowest round of the dav.

Stanford now must wait for the results of the
PC A A Conference Championships, which con
clude Monday. If Fresno State, the top team in
the PC AA, were to win, then Stanford would
almost certainly get a berth, as the NCAA se
lection committee will be taking five or six West
Coast teams and Stanford is in the top five.
However, if an upstart were to take the
PC A A, then it would take that conference's au
tomatic berth, and possibly leave Stanford as
the sixth team in a five-team group.
"It's not a certainty yet," Schaaf said. "It
should have been, but we lost our last two tour
naments to Oregon. They're playing much bet
ter than we are now; that's why we're in the po
sition we are now."
"We tied UCLA, which was big," Walsworth
said. "I felt we played a little bit better today,
but I don't think we've played up to our poten
tial."

Stanford did record five scores of below 80,
a rarity on this difficult course. After all, the
three goiters tied for ninth had a tourney
average of 78. Carl Wagner shot exactly that
yesterday to finish tied for 12th at 313.
"Congratulations also ought to go to Carl,"
Schaaf said. "It was maybe not as good as he's
played all year, but it was still a good finish.. ..
Carl s season should not be overlooked."
Rich Marik also stroked a 78 yesterday to
finish third on the team at 318. Phil Rowley had
a 79 en route to a 322, while John Dickey had
his lowest round of the tourney, a 75, to wind up
a shot behind Rowley. Roger Miraglia's 83 left
him at 327.
"John Dickey had a good round today, his
first for a while," Schaaf said.
I he berths for the NCAA tourney (May 18-
3 I in Winston-Salem, N.C.) will be announced
Tuesday.

Don Walsworth's "finest per
formance in college" netted him
the Pacific 10 Conference individ
ual title and helped the Stanford
men's golf team eliminate a 12-
stroke deficit to finish in a tie for
fourth at the Pac-10 Champion
ships in Simi Valley.
USC captured the team champi
onship by 12 strokes over Oregon,
1,539- 1,551. Arizona State
finished third at 1,557, while the
Cardinal tied with defending con
ference champion UCLA at
1,562.

Walsworth fired a one-under
par 7 I (the only subpar round of
the tournament) at the Wood
Ranch Country Club, coming from
three strokes behind to edge 1985
NCAA Champion Sam Randolph
of USC, 296-297. ASU's Bill
Mayfair finished third at 301.
"This was easily Don's finest
performance in college," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said. "In Sam
Randolph, Don had to defeat the
reigning national champion, one
of the leading amateurs in the
world, and the low amateur at the
recently completed Masters tourn
ament.

With a one-under-par 71 in yesterday's final round, Don
VValsworth won the Pacific 10 Conference individual title.
Walsworth shot the only sub-par round of the tournament to heat
I SC's Sam Randolph by one stroke.
"In order to win," Schaaf added, "Don
needed one of the best rounds of golf that he
could play, and he was equal to the task. The
Pac-10 is a very tough, very competitive confer
ence — and Don is a very worthy champion. I'm
very pleased for him."
Walsworth, a senior from Marceline, Miss.,
shot an even-par 36 on the front nine to catch
Randolph, who shot a 39. When Walsworth
completed the back nine, Randolph was at the
14th, two strokes behind him. Walsworth then
had to wait as Randolph made a furious come
back attempt — which ended as a 12-foot putt
for an eagle on the par-five 18th lipped out.
"I was pretty nervous," Walsworth said. "I
was actually all ready for a playoff. I had been

hitting balls and stuff.
"It feels great, really good," Walsworth said
about winning. "I can't even describe it. I
haven't won a (collegiate) tournament in four
years. ... If I was going to pick one to win that
was it.
"It was kind of nice to end my college career
beating Sam on his home course," he said. "It'll
be something to say 30 years from now. Hope
fully it'll be the start of a few more (wins)."
Walsworth, who won the Missouri Amateur
last summer, is planning on playing amateur
golf again this summer, then turning pro after
the U.S. Amateur Championship in September.
Not to be lost amidst Walsworth's victory is
the importance of Stanford's final round yester
day. The Cardinal needed to beat or tie UCLA
to have a decent chance at an NCAA tourna
ment berth, and it did it by shooting the second
lowest round of the dav.

Stanford now must wait for the results of the
PC A A Conference Championships, which con
clude Monday. If Fresno State, the top team in
the PC AA, were to win, then Stanford would
almost certainly get a berth, as the NCAA se
lection committee will be taking five or six West
Coast teams and Stanford is in the top five.
However, if an upstart were to take the
PC A A, then it would take that conference's au
tomatic berth, and possibly leave Stanford as
the sixth team in a five-team group.
"It's not a certainty yet," Schaaf said. "It
should have been, but we lost our last two tour
naments to Oregon. They're playing much bet
ter than we are now; that's why we're in the po
sition we are now."
"We tied UCLA, which was big," Walsworth
said. "I felt we played a little bit better today,
but I don't think we've played up to our poten
tial."

Stanford did record five scores of below 80,
a rarity on this difficult course. After all, the
three goiters tied for ninth had a tourney
average of 78. Carl Wagner shot exactly that
yesterday to finish tied for 12th at 313.
"Congratulations also ought to go to Carl,"
Schaaf said. "It was maybe not as good as he's
played all year, but it was still a good finish.. ..
Carl s season should not be overlooked."
Rich Marik also stroked a 78 yesterday to
finish third on the team at 318. Phil Rowley had
a 79 en route to a 322, while John Dickey had
his lowest round of the tourney, a 75, to wind up
a shot behind Rowley. Roger Miraglia's 83 left
him at 327.
"John Dickey had a good round today, his
first for a while," Schaaf said.
