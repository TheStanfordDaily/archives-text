## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Don Walsworth's "finest per
formance in college" netted him
the Pacific 10 Conference individ
ual title and helped the Stanford
men's golf team eliminate a 12-
stroke deficit to finish in a tie for
fourth at the Pac-10 Champion
ships in Simi Valley.
USC captured the team champi
onship by 12 strokes over Oregon,
1,539- 1,551. Arizona State
finished third at 1,557, while the
Cardinal tied with defending con
ference champion UCLA at
1,562.

Walsworth fired a one-under
par 7 I (the only subpar round of
the tournament) at the Wood
Ranch Country Club, coming from
three strokes behind to edge 1985
NCAA Champion Sam Randolph
of USC, 296-297. ASU's Bill
Mayfair finished third at 301.
"This was easily Don's finest
performance in college," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said. "In Sam
Randolph, Don had to defeat the
reigning national champion, one
of the leading amateurs in the
world, and the low amateur at the
recently completed Masters tourn
ament.
