# Taking a shot at the NCAAs
## Dukes, Purpur, Nickerson could be best team trio ever 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Close your eyes and imagine a
female shot putter or discus thrower.
What comes to mind?
If you're like most people, you
probably imagined some sort of East
German or Soviet hulk, a 300-pound
steroid-filled monster, barely distin
guishable from a man. That's the
stereotype, and that's what most
people expect.
If you're big, you can throw the
shotput. That's the myth. That's also
what three Stanford women have
proven wrong.
Together, seniors Pain Dukes and
Karen Nickerson and freshman Patty
Purpur have turned that myth on its
ear. They're not huge, they're not
masculine and they're not slow.
What they are is quick, lean and
muscular, a combination which
makes them nearly unstoppable.

Individually, each is a national
caliber athlete. Together, they are
probably the best group of throwers
in NCAA history.
And together they bring a whole
new image to the female thrower.
Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wol-
Iman, one of the team's throwing
coaches, said. "They're the best
throwing group in the country, yet
people still can't believe they're
throwers. They prove that you don't
have to be unattractive to throw well.
"They're real good for the sport,
real good role models for young
throwers." he said.
Dukes agreed. "You don't have to
be that big or brute-like to do well.
We like to perpetuate the fact that
you don't have to weigh 300
pounds.' she said.
"At meets, people ask me. 'What
do you do?" I tell them I throw the
shot put and they don't believe it."

she said.
But if you look at their records, you
have to believe it. These ladies can
throw.
So far it's been an extraordinary
season for the three, and with the
NCAA Championships just around
the corner, it could get even better.
Wollman believes that if everything
goes right, all three could garner All -
American honors in the discus, and
Purpurand Dukes could become All-
American shot putters. If it happens,
it will be the first time in NCAA his
tory that one school has placed so
many throwers that high.
All three attribute part of their suc
cess to the fact that they have each
other to work with, a luxury which
few female throwers enjoy. For Pur
pur, a freshman, the presence of
Dukes and Nickerson has made the
transition to collegiate competition a
whole lot easier.
"Just to have someone there helps
a lot. I can look and see what they've
done, all the work they ve put in,"
Purpur said.
Purpur has put in a lot of work as
well. She came to Stanford from
Grand Forks, N.D., as the nation's
top-rated female thrower. Since then,
she's lived up to the ranking's prom
ise.
"She's got all that it takes," Nick
erson said.
At this year's NCAA Indoor
Championships, Purpur surprised
many track fans as well as herself by
placing seventh, a spot which made
her the Cardinal's only indoor All -
American.
Her indoor mark qualifed her for
the outdoor shot put championships,
and last weekend she qualified in the
discus as well. Competing in the Big
Meet against California, Purpur
placed second with a discus throw of
173-3, a personal best which earned
her a berth in the NCA As.
At the NCA As some of her main
competition will come from those
same teammates who helped Purpur
get where she is.
This will be Nickerson's fourth
straight appearance at the NCA As:
last year she placed third, and this
year she is hoping to do even better.
The discus could very well come
down to a three-way competition be
tween Nickerson, Dukes and San
Diego State's Laura DeSnoo. Ac
cording to Nickerson, the outcome
will probably depend solely on
"whoever has a good day."
So far the highlight of Nickerson's
season has been her victory in the
Texas Relays. Nickerson won the

Relays, making herself one of the
meet's few two-time champions.
Recently Nickerson has been in
somewhat of a slump, hut she and
Wollman aren't too worried. Early in
the season, Wollman had her lifting a
lot of weights in order to build her
strength for the last few important
meets. Because heavy lifting takes a
toll on the body, both Nickerson and
her coach see her slump as a side ef
fect of the training.
As soon as she gets that bounce
back, she'll be fine," Wollman said.
"She's certainly one of the best
throwers in the country. She's been
through it before, and she knows how
good she is.
"We have nothing but confidence
in her," he said.
And then there's Dukes, who just

this year decided that she had confi
dence in herself. It took her three
years to realize how good she could
be, but since then it's been an
amazing year for Dukes.
Last year Dukes' personal bests
were 51 -7Vi in the shotput and 165-0
in the discus. This year they're 56-B'/i
and 180-8. She is currently fourth on
the NCAA all-time shotput list and
one of the favorites to win the discus.
Everyone kept telling me how
much potential I had, but I never
quite believed it. I would learn what I
needed to do, but I would never
really do it. Now I want to learn; I
know what I can to do," Dukes said.
I o put her learning in perspective,
Dukes is already one of the top two

collegiate shot putters in the nation,
and Wollman believes that "she with
out a doubt has the most potential of
any thrower in the country, including
everyone that has ever thrown," he
said.
For the future, Wollman and
Dukes are looking at another year of
training, and a possible Olympic spot
in 1988. For the present, they're
aiming to peak in early June for the
NCAAs.

This weekend, Dukes will rest,
while Nickerson and Purpur travel to
Modesto to compete for the Cardinal.
And though they're getting to be
quite well-known, they may be asked
once again, " Do you really throw the
shot?"

At the NCA As some of her main
competition will come from those
same teammates who helped Purpur
get where she is.
This will be Nickerson's fourth
straight appearance at the NCA As:
last year she placed third, and this
year she is hoping to do even better.
The discus could very well come
down to a three-way competition be
tween Nickerson, Dukes and San
Diego State's Laura DeSnoo. Ac
cording to Nickerson, the outcome
will probably depend solely on
"whoever has a good day."
So far the highlight of Nickerson's
season has been her victory in the
Texas Relays. Nickerson won the

Relays, making herself one of the
meet's few two-time champions.
Recently Nickerson has been in
somewhat of a slump, hut she and
Wollman aren't too worried. Early in
the season, Wollman had her lifting a
lot of weights in order to build her
strength for the last few important
meets. Because heavy lifting takes a
toll on the body, both Nickerson and
her coach see her slump as a side ef
fect of the training.
As soon as she gets that bounce
back, she'll be fine," Wollman said.
"She's certainly one of the best
throwers in the country. She's been
through it before, and she knows how
good she is.
"We have nothing but confidence
in her," he said.
And then there's Dukes, who just

this year decided that she had confi
dence in herself. It took her three
years to realize how good she could
be, but since then it's been an
amazing year for Dukes.
Last year Dukes' personal bests
were 51 -7Vi in the shotput and 165-0
in the discus. This year they're 56-B'/i
and 180-8. She is currently fourth on
the NCAA all-time shotput list and
one of the favorites to win the discus.
Everyone kept telling me how
much potential I had, but I never
quite believed it. I would learn what I
needed to do, but I would never
really do it. Now I want to learn; I
know what I can to do," Dukes said.
I o put her learning in perspective,
Dukes is already one of the top two

According to Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wollman, Pam Dukes has
the most potential of any thrower in the country." Dukes, along with

Nr \ \ ear .' ' /* lree ordinal women are expected to excel at the
NCAA Championships.
collegiate shot putters in the nation,
and Wollman believes that "she with
out a doubt has the most potential of
any thrower in the country, including
everyone that has ever thrown," he
said.
For the future, Wollman and
Dukes are looking at another year of
training, and a possible Olympic spot
in 1988. For the present, they're
aiming to peak in early June for the
NCAAs.

This weekend, Dukes will rest,
while Nickerson and Purpur travel to
Modesto to compete for the Cardinal.
And though they're getting to be
quite well-known, they may be asked
once again, " Do you really throw the
shot?"


Patty Purpur
Potential two-event All-American
Close your eyes and imagine a
female shot putter or discus thrower.
What comes to mind?
If you're like most people, you
probably imagined some sort of East
German or Soviet hulk, a 300-pound
steroid-filled monster, barely distin
guishable from a man. That's the
stereotype, and that's what most
people expect.
If you're big, you can throw the
shotput. That's the myth. That's also
what three Stanford women have
proven wrong.
Together, seniors Pain Dukes and
Karen Nickerson and freshman Patty
Purpur have turned that myth on its
ear. They're not huge, they're not
masculine and they're not slow.
What they are is quick, lean and
muscular, a combination which
makes them nearly unstoppable.

Individually, each is a national
caliber athlete. Together, they are
probably the best group of throwers
in NCAA history.
And together they bring a whole
new image to the female thrower.
Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wol-
Iman, one of the team's throwing
coaches, said. "They're the best
throwing group in the country, yet
people still can't believe they're
throwers. They prove that you don't
have to be unattractive to throw well.
"They're real good for the sport,
real good role models for young
throwers." he said.
Dukes agreed. "You don't have to
be that big or brute-like to do well.
We like to perpetuate the fact that
you don't have to weigh 300
pounds.' she said.
"At meets, people ask me. 'What
do you do?" I tell them I throw the
shot put and they don't believe it."

she said.
But if you look at their records, you
have to believe it. These ladies can
throw.
So far it's been an extraordinary
season for the three, and with the
NCAA Championships just around
the corner, it could get even better.
Wollman believes that if everything
goes right, all three could garner All -
American honors in the discus, and
Purpurand Dukes could become All-
American shot putters. If it happens,
it will be the first time in NCAA his
tory that one school has placed so
many throwers that high.
All three attribute part of their suc
cess to the fact that they have each
other to work with, a luxury which
few female throwers enjoy. For Pur
pur, a freshman, the presence of
Dukes and Nickerson has made the
transition to collegiate competition a
whole lot easier.
"Just to have someone there helps
a lot. I can look and see what they've
done, all the work they ve put in,"
Purpur said.
Purpur has put in a lot of work as
well. She came to Stanford from
Grand Forks, N.D., as the nation's
top-rated female thrower. Since then,
she's lived up to the ranking's prom
ise.
"She's got all that it takes," Nick
erson said.
At this year's NCAA Indoor
Championships, Purpur surprised
many track fans as well as herself by
placing seventh, a spot which made
her the Cardinal's only indoor All -
American.
Her indoor mark qualifed her for
the outdoor shot put championships,
and last weekend she qualified in the
discus as well. Competing in the Big
Meet against California, Purpur
placed second with a discus throw of
173-3, a personal best which earned
her a berth in the NCA As.
At the NCA As some of her main
competition will come from those
same teammates who helped Purpur
get where she is.
