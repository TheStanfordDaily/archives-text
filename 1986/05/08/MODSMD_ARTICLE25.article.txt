## 'Heretics of Dune': better than average sci-fi 
### H.W. MORT 
"The Heretics of Dune"
By Frank Herbert
New in paperback
Question: What happens when a
group of power-hungry religious men
meets a group of power-hungry reli
gious women? And what happens if
you toss in Joe Super-Stud and a girl
who can control giant worms?
Answer: Adam and Eve join the
Battle of the Sexes.
I his is what "Heretics of Dune"by
Frank Herbert should have been
called. Once again Frank is trying to
give us a message about society. In
this case, he presents us with two pan
galactic superpowers, each of which is
bent on controlling the universe and
is trying to accomplish this through
various types of manipulation such as
drug trade, infiltration of various gov
ernments and genetic breeding pro
grams. (Surely this couldn't be
Frank's distorted view of our current
political situation.)
The two superpowers are sex
based and each is equipped with
unique gender characteristics. The
Bene Tleilax is a male-dominated
priesthood, which manages to avoid
the loss of its top men by placing
them in new bodies about once every
300 years. They are religious fanatics,
who feel that they are following the
one true path and, as a result, go
around making life unbearable for all
the non-believers. The other group is
Bene Gesserit, superwomeo who
mangage to use psychological and
sexual weapons (quite effectively, I
might add) to further their cause. Yet
they don't even attempt to use reli

gion as a power base (except upon the
stupid uninitiated). They are refresh
ingly blatant about the fact that they
are a group of power-hungry women
who are into arranged marriages to
forward their genetic manipulations.
Yet before we relish in this bit of
hyperfeminism, these women are at

once extremely stupid and disgust
ingly perceptive. They are still fooling
around with other people's genes,
even though this is how they got into
their present predicament, and they
are still controlling the universe with
their asexual seducers and carefully
placed priestess-wives. But before the

men reading this get smug, Frank
puts us in our place too. The Bene
Tleilax are so incredibly stupid and
ineffective that they can barely
manage to control their inferiors, let
alone a whole universe. To top this,
they worship a giant worm. If it
wasn't their control of the drug mar

ket, these men would be in deep trou
ble.
Frank, having gotten bored with vi
cious character assassinations,
decides to throw two relative in
nocents into the arena. Enter Duncan
and Sheeana. Duncan is a product of
both groups. Created from the ge

netic tanks of the Tleilax, he is
bought by the Gesserit because of his
incredible powers, which include: a
perceptive insight into just about
everything, incredible speed, coor
dination and weapon mastery, a
storehouse of about 200 lives worth
of memories and a potency that most
men would die for.
On the other hand, we have
Sheeana, a poor, homeless waif, who
had "done good" by being able to
control giant worms. Yes, this girl is
able to fascinate and terrify
everybody with her control of giant
slimy things and with the help of a
few homemade qualities like a voice
that forces people to follow her or
ders (kind of an instant brainwashing
tool). Here's where the fun begins.
Everybody wants to get Duncan to
gether with Sheeana and get a good,
strong hold on their "litter." (That's a
quote from the book.) Unfortunately,
no one wants to let the other guys
have their fun too.
Frank, probably bowing to popular
appeal, includes a chase scene in
which both Duncan and Sheeana go
flitting about their respective worlds
having experiences and life
endangering fun. But what is the final
outcome, you ask? Aside from a
scene from "Star Wars," I'm not
going to tell you. (A planet blows up.)
Note: If you are not a Frank Her
bert addict or a Dune Historian, this
book will confuse you at times (kind
of like this review). But don't worry,
the book is good enough to stand on
its own, and unlike most sci-fi, it is
really interesting and does not read
like an engineer's dream. So go out
and buy this book and make a dead
man (yes, Frank is dead) happy.
