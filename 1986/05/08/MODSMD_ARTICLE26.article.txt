"Love is Hell"
By Matt Groening
Pantheon Books, $5.95.
My life is hell. Your life is prob
ably hell, too. And though I may
have a hell of a love life, love, also,
is hell.
Matt Groening is hell, or at least
a hell of a cartoonist, and his new
book, "Love is Hell," is one hell of
a book.
Emerging from a broad base of
cartoonists loosely defined as
"underground," and having done
spreads for L.A.'s seminal Wet

Magazine, Groening carries on with
an 1980s sensibility the traditions
established by 1960s pioneers
Robert Crumb, Spain and Gill

Matt Groening is hell, or at least
one hell of a cartoonist. . . .

Shelton — cartoons with an edge.
In his first volume, "Love is
Hell," Groening excoriates the
fatuous, the facile and the self

indulgent — largely the ethos for a
generation of his readers — in
single-page sketches featuring
mutant rabbits that effectively bite

the hand that feeds them while
poking fun at the vagaries of mating
and the mating ritual. From the ini
tial spark of interest to Splitsville,

and on to the dreaded Second
Divorce, Groening chronicles
modern living and loving with
bitingly accurate portrayals of a
generation that has broken from
tradition, from sanity and finally
from itself in the rabid search for
Eros, Truth and Funky Love.
Groening's work becomes
worthwhile because it shows what
needs to be shown without making
it terrible to see; it illuminates with
out blinding because it is funny. If
you are alive in the '80s, you're
bound to find yourself somewhere
between the covers of "Love is
Hell." Turn your coffee table into a
mine field; buy "Love is Hell"
before you live it.
