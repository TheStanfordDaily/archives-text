# Viewer dollars lost in 'Money Pit'

### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"The Money Pit" is the most honestly
titled movie to come along in quite a while.
You sit in the audience, helpless, while you
watch this overstuffed turkey grind along,
swallowing five bucks of your cash and (if
you stick with it) two hours of your life with
its mechanical pratfalls, forgettable charac
ters, over-stretched plot and listless direc
tion.
The story is about a couple that buys a
big, expensively furnished house at a
ridiculously cheap price, finds out it's full of
defects, Fixes them and lives (presumably)
happily ever after. That's literally all there is
to this movie.
The storyline might have been turned into
a modest, 1940s style domestic comedy, but
this is a Steven Spielberg production, which
means that everything is so ludicrously over
scaled that the production design becomes
the butt of its own joke, and the title takes
on a whole new meaning.
Director Richard Benjamin stages each
episode of a bathtub or sink or chimney fall
ing through the floor as if it were the newest
and funniest of gags: the set-up is exactly the
same each time, with the characters standing

around thinking that nothing else could pos
sibly go wrong with their new home when —
wham! — something comes crashing down
spectacularly.
The First of these disasters is also the most
amusing; a grand staircase literally shakes it
self apart, while Tom Hanks is trying to walk
up it. A later series of chain-reaction prat
falls (in the style of "1941" and "Indiana
Jones") is moderately entertaining, but so
poorly staged that it doesn't give us half the
thrill we'd expect from such an elaborate
Rube Goldberg gag. And once we realize
that this pitifully undistinguished slapstick is
all the movie has to give us, everything
becomes unfunny very quickly.
You tend to disassociate Tom Hanks from
this project soon after you see it. He was
agreeably skillful in the first half of last sum
mer's "Volunteers," and he struggles
gamely — but not too hard — here.
Shelley Long (of TV's "Cheers") works
way too hard at her role; she's desperate to
make us laugh, and she broadens her worst
TV mannerisms to fill the wide screen.
Alexander Godunov gives the only per
formance of any interest He's very enjoy
able as the perfectly self-centered symphony
conductor, Max, but his character's person
ality is scaled to the cameo status of the role,
and Godunov doesn't have much to do.

This is yet another case of "Steven Spiel
berg presents. . .Spielberg has taken to
"presenting" directors who have distin
guished themselves with an original, enjoy
able first feature, giving them projects Spiel
berg has neither the time nor the desire to
do himself.
Barry ("Diner") Levinson was saddled
with the dismal "Young Sherlock Holmes,"
and now Benjamin, after the promise of
"My Favorite Year," sinks to this. It's all
rather insulting; it's one thing for Spielberg
to give these second-rate features to new,
young directors who are trying to break into
movies. But hiring proven fresh talent —
people who might have turned down other
projects for the security of the Spielberg
name — may do nothing but jeopardize
these directors' careers.
Though "The Money Pit" is not as obvi
ously Spielberg-derivative as "Holmes,"
there's a built-in assumption in these proj
ects (and in Spielberg's "Amazing Stories")
that every talented director will want to be
doing exactly the same kind of fluff Spiel
berg himself is so adept at. Now in his late
30s, he has already become the kind of
patriarchal movie mogul who encourages
imitators. Nothing about the film industry
sounds more depressing right now than the
potential Spielbergization of Hollywood.


Though Tom Hanks and Shelley Long are current box office draws, their performances
cannot save "The Money Pit" from hitting bottom.
