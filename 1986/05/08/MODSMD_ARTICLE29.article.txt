## Stein deviates from the statistical norm 
### LISA HERSCHBACH Staff writer 
Charles Stein, professor of statistics, is not
your standard deviant. An internationally
renowned statistician and professor at Stan
ford since 1953, Stein is also the first Stanford
professor ever arrested for protesting against
apartheid.
"I believe apartheid is wrong, and I believe
that by divestment many universities will
make a small contribution to the end of apart
heid," Stein, 66, said.
Stein was arrested in October, along with
five students, for refusing to end an anti
apartheid sit-in in Old Union. "I had consid
ered taking an active part in the protests for
some time, and the beating of Robby Perkins
brought me to action," he said.
Stein's action has brought him a county
court sentence of four days in a weekend work
program, which he said will probably mean
"picking up trash along the highways."
"Many professors at Stanford are active in
the struggle for divestment — speaking at
rallies, for example. However, there aren't as
many involved as there ought to be," Stein
said.
"People are busy. It's hard to spare the time
for protest activity, and the nervous strain in
terferes with teaching and research. Younger
people are afraid of affecting their chances of
getting tenure.
"Those professors in the social sciences may
be viewed as irresponsible in a way that will
stain their credibility. Principles of statistics,
however, are true whether or not I am in
volved in a sit-in.
"Like many other people, professors don't
get involved because they don't think in terms
of collective action. Professors like to be able
to see the direct effects of their actions."
While Stein admitted that "each person can

only have a small effect," he said he believed
that "as a movement, protest activity has been
effective, and will continue to be."
Stein, who said he has "always felt that war
was terrible and wrong," was also active in the
struggle against the war in Vietnam. In 1966
he was arrested for obstructing the entrance to
a military induction center in Oakland.
Stein is currently very concerned with U.S.
action in Central America."The issue of aid to
the contras is coming up in Congress in the
near future, and I strongly urge people to
write to their representatives," he said.
Stein, who "is planning to retire in a year or
two," has had an incredible career and made
huge contributions to the study of mathemati
cal statistics, despite his time-consuming
protest activity.
He was recently appointed as a Ray Lyman
Wilbur professor of statistics, one of about
100 endowed professorships named after the
former president of Stanford.
"Charles Stein has been the guiding spirit of
the Statistics Department," said colleague
Bradley Efron. "Our number one national
ranking is, I think, because he's here. Charles
is, in my opinion and in the opinion of most
people, the greatest mathematical statistician
in the world."
Many of Stein's ideas have broken new
ground in the theory and practice of statistics.
According to Efron, when Gustav Elving, a
leading Finnish statistician, visited Stanford
and saw Stein working, "Elving wondered why
anyone else bothered to work."
Retirement will not interfere with Stein's
commitment to activism and statistics. "I will
continue to think about statistics. In particu
lar, I'd like to do some computational work,
which I never previously found time for,"
Stein said. "I also want to do more hiking and
be involved in more political work."
