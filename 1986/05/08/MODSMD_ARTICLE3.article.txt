# GLAS hosts a GALA affair
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
Some Stanford students scrape
up confidence and courage for
long months or years before
"coming out of the closet" here.
But for the friends and families of
gays and lesbians, the announce
ment is just the beginning of the
struggle.

Feature

When Joel Bellenson's
roommate revealed that he was
gay two years ago, dormmates
pasted nasty notes on the bath
room mirror and made snide
remarks to Bellenson about his
sexual preferences. For nearly a
year, he was bothered by the
derogatory comments and atti
tudes of his classmates and
dormmates. he said.

Some people started whispering
that he was gay. "And, sure, some
people still think it,"he told a
group of about 30 at Branner
Lounge Tuesday. "At first it both
ered me. .. . Some women
thought 'Oh gosh, this guy is gay,
forget it." "
Now, two years later, Bellenson
hails openmindedness. But he says
he still finds his being associated
with homosexuality unsettling.
"I know I'm not gay, but the
label is disturbing . . . because of
the societal context." he said. "It's
like being called a communist or
something like that. You get
pretty uptight."
Bellenson, two other students
and a local parent spoke frankly
about their experiences with
friends and children who are gay
and lesbian. The informal discus

sion was part of the 12th annual Gay
and Lesbian Awareness Week
(GALA) here which will end Satur
day.
Many people don't know how hard
it is to be part of a minority group for
which society has little tolerance,
some GLAS members said.
Gerri Roe, a Palo Alto mother of
four, said that her daughter was
afraid to tell her parents she was a
lesbian, even though the family
already supported Roe's son, who
was openly gay.
"She thought it would ruin the
family," Roe recalled. "But it
didn't."
Such fear and guilt are typical of
gays and lesbians who begin to openly
integrate their sexual preferences into
their lifestyles, Roe said.
Roe has her own fears. When her
son Kevin moved to the city after
graduating from high school, "I was
afraid someone would kill him on the
streets of San Francisco," she said.
The anxiety was real; Kevin's friend
was stabbed in a park in the city.
Intolerance for and hatred toward
gays and lesbians are serious issues
for Roe and others at the discussion.
Lounging on sofas under soft after
noon sunlight, many spoke
philosophically and emotionally.
"Life is not easy for anyone," Roe
said. "Gays suffer cruelty."
"When our president says we're
defending Americans around the
world from attack, I think, 'Why isn't
he defending gays from violence right
here?' "
"We're all humans," said Trina
Rivera, a freshman who said she
"grew up knowing a lot of gay
people" and this year shares a room
with a lesbian.
"Why treat anyone differently?"
she continued. "We're all different
forms. We need variety."
