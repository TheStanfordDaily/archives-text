## 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
1 he Stantord men s volleyball team got some good
news on Monday: Kent Steffes of Pacific Palisades
High School announced he will attend Stanford next
year.
With the addition of Steffes, one of the most hotly
leeruited high school volleyball players this season,
Stantord Co-coaches Fred Sturm and Don Shaw
wrapped up an extremely successtul recruiting year.
I he Cardinal signed three of the top players in the
country.
Stettes, a Moot-3 middle blocker/outside hitter, had
verbally committed to volleyball powerhouse UCLA
but changed his mind at the last moment, signing on
Monday with the Cardinal.
Stettes is one of the tinest high school players
available, Shaw said. "He was highly sought after. We
were very fortunate to get him at the last second after
he had almost committed to UCLA. He is one of the
top recruits in the country by far.
"We had no idea we were going to get Kent. . .
everyone thought we had lost him. It would have been
a shame to lose him â€” he was basically our No. 1 guy.
"Fred (Sturm) did a masterful job of recruiting. You
really have to credit him on that one," Shaw said.
Shaw and Sturm also signed 6-5 Dan Hanan, a
middle blocker/outside hitter from Edison High
School in Huntington Beach, who concentrated on
basketball in high school.
"Dan just started getting serious about volleyball
last year," Shaw explained. "Both he and Steffes were
good high school basketball players. But his improve

ment has been unbelievable: he's getting better all the
time. They are the two finest prospects available for
sure."
Another basketball player, 6-3 Craig F orsyth of
Santa Monica High School, signed as well. "He's an
extraordinary athlete," Shaw said. "Technically he lias
more to learn, but he makes up for his lack of training
with his athletic ability. Craig was one of the best ath
letes available but he hasn't had the coaching of the
other two.
"All three could step in and be starters next year.'
Parker Blackmail, a 5-1 I native of Santa Monica
who attended Loyola High School, may give junioi
Steve Modory a challenge at the setter position next
year. "Blackmail was not highly recruited," Slum
said,"but he has a good attitude and is a hard worker.
He's going to give us depth at the setter position.
"He could push Modory as well it you've got
someone at your heels, you will have to improve.
Blackmail is that good, even though he'll be a fresh
man. Steve will realize that if he does not work hard to
improve, he might lose his starting spot."
A fifth player, walk-on Steve Waters from Miriest
High School in Rolling Hills, will also be attending
Stanford. Shaw described the (>-2 outside hitter as "a
pretty good player."
"We were real fortunate to get this kind of class.''
Shaw said. "We're losing Jon (Root). Chris (Braun).
Brett Monello and Dan Parr this is a critical lime for
the program.
"Only once every five years or so docs a group like
this come along. Not only are they top players, they're
also top students. Lhis is by far our best recruiting class
as far as players coming in with experience. I his is
probably the best recruiting class in the country.
