is a great honor to win it. although I know that's an
overused cliche."

last three NCAA championship meets and has taken the
past two NCAA titles in the 200 individual medley.
F.ven with his outstanding performances. Morales was
no shoo-in for the award, as the Pac-10 is loaded with
world-class swimmers.

"Of course, there was (Stanford swimmers) John Mof
fet and Jeff KostottV Morales said of his closest competi
tion foi the award. " And of course there was (California
freestyler) Matt Biondi. who has dominated a lot of the
media attention lately."
In addition to his collegiate titles. Morales earned three
medals at the IMB4 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He
won two silvers, in the 100-meter butterfly and the 200-
meter l .M.. losing onl\ because of world-record efforts by
West Germany's Michael (iross and Canada's Alex
Baumann. He got his other medal, a gold, in the 400-
meter medley rela\.

Year in 1 1 >S4 by Swimming World magazine and Bay
Area Sports Hall of l ame Male Athlete of the Year the
same year, but the junior from Santa Clara refused put the
Pac-10 aw ard beneath the others he has won.
"I never take anything for granted, he said. "1
wouldn't take this lightly. When I'm done swimming. I
will look back at every award I've won and will see them
all equally."
Kenney's selection came as no surprise. He has coached
the Cardinal to 45 consecutive dual match \ ictories over a
four-year period. "His record speaks for itselt. Morales
said. "It takes a special coach to put together such a
string."
