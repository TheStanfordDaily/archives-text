Fraud mars Bangladesh election
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Both major parties claimed victory last
night in the third parliamentary election in the 15-year history of
Bangladesh, an election marred by widespread fraud, intimidation and
violence.
Sheik Hasina Wazed, leader of the opposition Awami League, said,
"We have won the mandate of the people."
Nonetheless, the government-backed Jatiya Party is expected to be
given a majority of the 330 seats in the Parliament when the final results
are announced today.
Hasina, the daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh
to independence in 1971, charged that 25 of her party's workers were
killed and more than 500 injured in the election.
Most Western analysts expected that the voting would be rigged to
give President Hussain Mohammad Ershad's Jatiya Party the two-thirds
he needs to approve the edicts he issues under martial law. The Awami
League was expected to get as many as 80 seats simply for taking part in
the election, which other parties chose to boycott.
Foreign diplomats who toured election areas yesterday reported many
instances of fraud and questioned the validity of the results announced
by the government. Reporters saw election workers stuffing ballots into
boxes at dozens of places.
In some areas, among them the jute industry community of Nar
singhdi, 40 miles north of Dhaka, violence erupted when armed party
workers prevented voters of rival parties from entering polling places.
Most of the fraud appeared to have taken place at polling places con
trolled by the government-backed Jatiya Party. In Narsinghdi, troops of
the Bangladesh Rifles watched idly as club-wielding Jatiya workers took
up positions outside several voting places and prevented Awami League
voters from entering.
Bomb blast kills 11, wounds 114
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Eleven persons were killed and 114
wounded when a powerful bomb destroyed Sri Lanka's central telegraph
office here yesterday, the second lethal attack attributed to Tamil
separatists in less than a week.
The clocks in the colonial-style building stopped at exactly 9:23 a.m.
as the two-story complex collapsed in ruins from the blast. Hundreds of
people were doing business in the office at the time of the blast.
Fifty-eight of the injured had been admitted to hospital, 20 of them in
serious condition, the Ministiy of National Security said.
Among those killed were an assistant postmaster, a cashier, two
female clerks and a messenger. The bodies of the other six have not yet
been identified.
The ministry statement said the government believed the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil separatist guerrilla group, was respon
sible for the attack.
The ministiy charged that the attack showed that Tamil guerrilla
leaders, based in southern India, were no longer interested in a political
solution to the ethnic crisis between the Sinhala majority and the Tamil
minority in Sri Lanka.
I ast Saturday, a bomb ripped apart an Air Lanka jet at the capital's
Katunayake airport, killing 22 persons. The same Tamil group is
suspected in that attack.
Yesterday's blast occurred as the Lankan Cabinet was meeting to dis
cuss the ethnic crisis and the escalating violence. In Parliament, an oppo
sition leader referred to the incident and blasted the government for its
security failures.
Schultz warns Korean opposition
SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of State George Shultz met yester
day with South Korean opposition leaders and asked them to turn away
from confrontation with the military regime of President Chun Doo
Hwan.
Shultz brought a stern message to the opposition, which is demanding
more political freedom in advance of the presidential election that Chun
has promised in 1988.
Excluded from his meeting were the two most prominent leaders of
the opposition, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam, who have been firm
in their refusal to compromise with the regime.
The United States "strongly supports" increased democracy in South
Korea, Shultz told reporters disingenuously, but added, "If it's going to
work, there has to be an element of political stability.
"Violent confrontation such as we've seen is not a contribution to
that," he said. " An opposition that seeks to incite violence is not making
a contribution to that."
Aides said Shultz planned to repeat those sentiments in a breakfast
session with both pro-government and opposition political figures today.
Shult/\ statement reflected U.S. alarm at increasingly violent anti
government demonstrations here, as well as irritation over the refusal of
leading dissidents Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam to cooperate with
the regime.
Syrian terrorist connection probed
I ON DON — Authorities here and in West Germany are investigating
whether Syrian diplomats were involved in the unsuccessful April 17 at
tempt to place a bomb aboard an Israeli airliner at London's Heathrow
Airport and in the March 29 bombing of the German-Arab Friendship
Society in West Berlin.
In a terse statement yesterday to Parliament, British Foreign Secre
tary Geoffrey Howe confirmed that discussions had been held with
Syrian Ambassador Loutof Haydar during which "we discussed the El
\l bombing." Howe said he could "give no other details."
In West Berlin, justice officials said that two Arabs who have
confessed to the March 29 bombing of the German-Arab Friendship So
ciety there have told police that they smuggled the explosives into the
West from the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin.
I'he two. Ahmed Nawaf Mansour Hasi, a stateless Palestinian, and
Farouk Salameh, a Jordanian, originally were arrested for complicity in
the separate bombing on April 5 of the La Belle discotheque in West
Berlin that killed two people and injured 230. Police said both have con
tinued to deny involvement in the disco bombing.
Reagan returns, cites allied support
WASHINGTON — President Reagan returned to the White House
yesterday from his 13-day Asian trip to a flag-waving reception and said
he had gained the support of the United States' top allies in "winning the
\sar' against terrorism and "wiping this scourge from the face of the
earth."
In brief remarks to welcoming Cabinet members on the south lawn of
the Executive Mansion. Reagan also asserted that the Tokyo summit
meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies had made a start
toward solving some of the world's toughest economic problems, from
food surpluses to trade imbalances. The red-coated Marine Band was on
hand for his return, as were several hundred supporters and aides, some
of whom waved miniature U.S. flags.
The president, with the first lady at his side, said he was "more than
pleased" that the other leaders he conferred with at the Japanese capital
agreed to "move beyond words and rhetoric in the struggle against ter
rorism." adding: "Terrorists and those who support them — especially
governments — have been put on notice. It is going to be tougher from
now on."
As to the specific economic problems on the conference agenda,
Reagan said the summit nations had agreed that the issues of trade im
balances and unstable currencies would be dealt with not separately but
rather as part of an overall effort to coordinate international economic

Reagan returns, cites allied support
WASHINGTON — President Reagan returned to the White House
yesterday from his 13-day Asian trip to a flag-waving reception and said
he had gained the support of the United States' top allies in "winning the
\sar' against terrorism and "wiping this scourge from the face of the
earth."
In brief remarks to welcoming Cabinet members on the south lawn of
the Executive Mansion. Reagan also asserted that the Tokyo summit
meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies had made a start
toward solving some of the world's toughest economic problems, from
food surpluses to trade imbalances. The red-coated Marine Band was on
hand for his return, as were several hundred supporters and aides, some
of whom waved miniature U.S. flags.
The president, with the first lady at his side, said he was "more than
pleased" that the other leaders he conferred with at the Japanese capital
agreed to "move beyond words and rhetoric in the struggle against ter
rorism." adding: "Terrorists and those who support them — especially
governments — have been put on notice. It is going to be tougher from
now on."
As to the specific economic problems on the conference agenda,
Reagan said the summit nations had agreed that the issues of trade im
balances and unstable currencies would be dealt with not separately but
rather as part of an overall effort to coordinate international economic
Fraud mars Bangladesh election
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Both major parties claimed victory last
night in the third parliamentary election in the 15-year history of
Bangladesh, an election marred by widespread fraud, intimidation and
violence.
Sheik Hasina Wazed, leader of the opposition Awami League, said,
"We have won the mandate of the people."
Nonetheless, the government-backed Jatiya Party is expected to be
given a majority of the 330 seats in the Parliament when the final results
are announced today.
Hasina, the daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh
to independence in 1971, charged that 25 of her party's workers were
killed and more than 500 injured in the election.
Most Western analysts expected that the voting would be rigged to
give President Hussain Mohammad Ershad's Jatiya Party the two-thirds
he needs to approve the edicts he issues under martial law. The Awami
League was expected to get as many as 80 seats simply for taking part in
the election, which other parties chose to boycott.
Foreign diplomats who toured election areas yesterday reported many
instances of fraud and questioned the validity of the results announced
by the government. Reporters saw election workers stuffing ballots into
boxes at dozens of places.
In some areas, among them the jute industry community of Nar
singhdi, 40 miles north of Dhaka, violence erupted when armed party
workers prevented voters of rival parties from entering polling places.
Most of the fraud appeared to have taken place at polling places con
trolled by the government-backed Jatiya Party. In Narsinghdi, troops of
the Bangladesh Rifles watched idly as club-wielding Jatiya workers took
up positions outside several voting places and prevented Awami League
voters from entering.
Bomb blast kills 11, wounds 114
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Eleven persons were killed and 114
wounded when a powerful bomb destroyed Sri Lanka's central telegraph
office here yesterday, the second lethal attack attributed to Tamil
separatists in less than a week.
The clocks in the colonial-style building stopped at exactly 9:23 a.m.
as the two-story complex collapsed in ruins from the blast. Hundreds of
people were doing business in the office at the time of the blast.
Fifty-eight of the injured had been admitted to hospital, 20 of them in
serious condition, the Ministiy of National Security said.
Among those killed were an assistant postmaster, a cashier, two
female clerks and a messenger. The bodies of the other six have not yet
been identified.
The ministry statement said the government believed the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a Tamil separatist guerrilla group, was respon
sible for the attack.
The ministiy charged that the attack showed that Tamil guerrilla
leaders, based in southern India, were no longer interested in a political
solution to the ethnic crisis between the Sinhala majority and the Tamil
minority in Sri Lanka.
I ast Saturday, a bomb ripped apart an Air Lanka jet at the capital's
Katunayake airport, killing 22 persons. The same Tamil group is
suspected in that attack.
Yesterday's blast occurred as the Lankan Cabinet was meeting to dis
cuss the ethnic crisis and the escalating violence. In Parliament, an oppo
sition leader referred to the incident and blasted the government for its
security failures.
Schultz warns Korean opposition
SEOUL, South Korea — Secretary of State George Shultz met yester
day with South Korean opposition leaders and asked them to turn away
from confrontation with the military regime of President Chun Doo
Hwan.
Shultz brought a stern message to the opposition, which is demanding
more political freedom in advance of the presidential election that Chun
has promised in 1988.
Excluded from his meeting were the two most prominent leaders of
the opposition, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam, who have been firm
in their refusal to compromise with the regime.
The United States "strongly supports" increased democracy in South
Korea, Shultz told reporters disingenuously, but added, "If it's going to
work, there has to be an element of political stability.
"Violent confrontation such as we've seen is not a contribution to
that," he said. " An opposition that seeks to incite violence is not making
a contribution to that."
Aides said Shultz planned to repeat those sentiments in a breakfast
session with both pro-government and opposition political figures today.
Shult/\ statement reflected U.S. alarm at increasingly violent anti
government demonstrations here, as well as irritation over the refusal of
leading dissidents Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam to cooperate with
the regime.
Syrian terrorist connection probed
I ON DON — Authorities here and in West Germany are investigating
whether Syrian diplomats were involved in the unsuccessful April 17 at
tempt to place a bomb aboard an Israeli airliner at London's Heathrow
Airport and in the March 29 bombing of the German-Arab Friendship
Society in West Berlin.
In a terse statement yesterday to Parliament, British Foreign Secre
tary Geoffrey Howe confirmed that discussions had been held with
Syrian Ambassador Loutof Haydar during which "we discussed the El
\l bombing." Howe said he could "give no other details."
In West Berlin, justice officials said that two Arabs who have
confessed to the March 29 bombing of the German-Arab Friendship So
ciety there have told police that they smuggled the explosives into the
West from the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin.
I'he two. Ahmed Nawaf Mansour Hasi, a stateless Palestinian, and
