# Senate panel passes tax reform
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders yes
terday promised swift Senate action on the giant
tax-overhaul legislation approved unanimously by
the Senate Finance Committee, as the measure
drew support from legislators across the political
spectrum.
The unusual coalition that praised at least the
general outline of the plan — ranging from liberal
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass) to conservative
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) — increased chances
that the measure that reduces rates in exchange for
eliminating so many popular tax breaks finally may
make it into law.
The bill would cut the top personal tax rate
nearly in half, to 27 percent, and reduce the cor
porate rate by a third, to 33 percent. The measure's
principal author, Finance Committee Chairman
Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), said yesterday that he
expects "a broad coalition" of consumer, labor and
business groups to lobby for the measure.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said, "We're going to bring it up as quickly as we
can," and he predicted there would be few major
changes in the bill produced by the committee in
the early morning hours yesterday. .
One factor that may prove him right, congres
sional sources said, is new procedural restrictions
imposed by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
balanced-budget law. Because amendments to
restore tax deductions would cost federal revenue,
increasing the deficit, they could be barred unless
they are coupled with offsetting tax increases else
where.
Packwood said this constraint could be
"tremendously helpful" in disciplining senators
who want to restore deductions but do not want to
raise tax rates above the levels in the bill. But he

taces one obstacle: the amendments technically
would not be out of order until after Congress
agrees on a budget resolution for fiscal 1987, and
the House is only now beginning its budget process.
One unknown ingredient, senators said, will be
the effect of television on Senate consideration of
the tax bill. Senate proceedings on C-Span begin
June 1, about the time Senate leaders hope to bring
up the measure.
'Its going to be difficult to see someone up there
arguing on TV before millions of people that we
ought to curtail IRAs (Individual Retirement Ac
counts) or (the deductibility of) interest on con
sumer loans," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas).
Powerful interests already are preparing their
opposition to the committee bill. Bentsen said his
office is beginning to receive many telephone calls
from constituents who have been notified by large
banking and investment firms that their IRAs will
be curtailed (the bill would end IRAs for taxpayers
not covered by company pension plans, although
interest earned on non-deductible IRA deposits
would remain tax-deferred).
Amendments are expected to be offered to
retain the full deduction for IRAs, to restore the
deduction for state and local sales taxes and to raise
the top rate in the plan to 35 percent, among
others.
However, the blanket opposition to tax overhaul
that was apparent among some senators when tax
overhaul was languishing in the Finance Commit
tee a few weeks ago seems to have evolved into
more specific objections. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
(R-N.Y.), for example, was once so opposed to the
measure he raised an official objection to a request
to have the Finance panel take votes.
Now, according to a spokesman, D'Amato

"thinks they're doing a pretty good job. This bill
has changed dramatically from what they were
talking about doing before.''
Besides reducing rates and limiting IRAs, the bill
would end entirely the deduction for interest on
consumer loans, such as those for autos and credit
card purchases. Interest on mortgages for up to two
homes would remain deductible, as would
charitable contribtions for those who itemize their
deductions and non-sales state and local taxes.
It would increase the personal exemption for tax
payers and dependents to $2,000 by 1988 for all
but the richest taxpayers and raise the standard
deduction for those who do not itemize.
A controversial change, expected to be the sub
ject of heavy lobbying, would end low effective tax
rates on capital gains.
The measure would raise corporate taxes by
more than $ 100 billion over five years, and cut in
dividual taxes by the same amount. The average tax
reduction for all taxpayers would be 6.2 percent,
with the biggest proportional tax cuts going to
lower-income taxpayers.
Those broad outlines are similar to the tax
revision bill the House passed last December, but
that measure would transfer about $140 billion in
taxes to businesses and give individuals a larger tax
cut. The House plan retains more individual deduc
tions, but has four brackets and a top rate of 38
percent for people and 36 percent for companies.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), in his first statement
on the Senate's tax-revision efforts, said the
Finance Committee bill "has suddenly given tax
reform enormous drive. The spirit and thrust very
nearly parallel the House-passed bill."

interest earned on non-deductible IRA deposits
would remain tax-deferred).
Amendments are expected to be offered to
retain the full deduction for IRAs, to restore the
deduction for state and local sales taxes and to raise
the top rate in the plan to 35 percent, among
others.
However, the blanket opposition to tax overhaul
that was apparent among some senators when tax
overhaul was languishing in the Finance Commit
tee a few weeks ago seems to have evolved into
more specific objections. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
(R-N.Y.), for example, was once so opposed to the
measure he raised an official objection to a request
to have the Finance panel take votes.
Now, according to a spokesman, D'Amato

"thinks they're doing a pretty good job. This bill
has changed dramatically from what they were
talking about doing before.''
Besides reducing rates and limiting IRAs, the bill
would end entirely the deduction for interest on
consumer loans, such as those for autos and credit
card purchases. Interest on mortgages for up to two
homes would remain deductible, as would
charitable contribtions for those who itemize their
deductions and non-sales state and local taxes.
It would increase the personal exemption for tax
payers and dependents to $2,000 by 1988 for all
but the richest taxpayers and raise the standard
deduction for those who do not itemize.
A controversial change, expected to be the sub
ject of heavy lobbying, would end low effective tax
rates on capital gains.
The measure would raise corporate taxes by
more than $ 100 billion over five years, and cut in
dividual taxes by the same amount. The average tax
reduction for all taxpayers would be 6.2 percent,
with the biggest proportional tax cuts going to
lower-income taxpayers.
Those broad outlines are similar to the tax
revision bill the House passed last December, but
that measure would transfer about $140 billion in
taxes to businesses and give individuals a larger tax
cut. The House plan retains more individual deduc
tions, but has four brackets and a top rate of 38
percent for people and 36 percent for companies.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), in his first statement
on the Senate's tax-revision efforts, said the
Finance Committee bill "has suddenly given tax
reform enormous drive. The spirit and thrust very
nearly parallel the House-passed bill."
WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders yes
terday promised swift Senate action on the giant
tax-overhaul legislation approved unanimously by
the Senate Finance Committee, as the measure
drew support from legislators across the political
spectrum.
The unusual coalition that praised at least the
general outline of the plan — ranging from liberal
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass) to conservative
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) — increased chances
that the measure that reduces rates in exchange for
eliminating so many popular tax breaks finally may
make it into law.
The bill would cut the top personal tax rate
nearly in half, to 27 percent, and reduce the cor
porate rate by a third, to 33 percent. The measure's
principal author, Finance Committee Chairman
Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), said yesterday that he
expects "a broad coalition" of consumer, labor and
business groups to lobby for the measure.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said, "We're going to bring it up as quickly as we
can," and he predicted there would be few major
changes in the bill produced by the committee in
the early morning hours yesterday. .
One factor that may prove him right, congres
sional sources said, is new procedural restrictions
imposed by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
balanced-budget law. Because amendments to
restore tax deductions would cost federal revenue,
increasing the deficit, they could be barred unless
they are coupled with offsetting tax increases else
where.
Packwood said this constraint could be
"tremendously helpful" in disciplining senators
who want to restore deductions but do not want to
raise tax rates above the levels in the bill. But he

taces one obstacle: the amendments technically
would not be out of order until after Congress
agrees on a budget resolution for fiscal 1987, and
the House is only now beginning its budget process.
One unknown ingredient, senators said, will be
the effect of television on Senate consideration of
the tax bill. Senate proceedings on C-Span begin
June 1, about the time Senate leaders hope to bring
up the measure.
'Its going to be difficult to see someone up there
arguing on TV before millions of people that we
ought to curtail IRAs (Individual Retirement Ac
counts) or (the deductibility of) interest on con
sumer loans," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas).
Powerful interests already are preparing their
opposition to the committee bill. Bentsen said his
office is beginning to receive many telephone calls
from constituents who have been notified by large
banking and investment firms that their IRAs will
be curtailed (the bill would end IRAs for taxpayers
not covered by company pension plans, although
interest earned on non-deductible IRA deposits
would remain tax-deferred).
Amendments are expected to be offered to
retain the full deduction for IRAs, to restore the
deduction for state and local sales taxes and to raise
the top rate in the plan to 35 percent, among
others.
