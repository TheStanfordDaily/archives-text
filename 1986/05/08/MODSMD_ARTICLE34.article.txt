# Congress vetoes Saudi arms sale
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House,
fearful that American-made weapons
might fall into the hands of Middle
East terrorists, joined the Senate yes
terday in disapproving President
Reagan's proposed $354 million arms
sale to Saudi Arabia — the first time
Congress has ever rejected a foreign
military sale.
The lopsided 356-62 House vote, a
far wider margin than expected,
precipitates an unprecedented
foreign policy confrontation between
Congress and the president. Al
though Reagan has vowed to veto the
resolution of disapproval, his oppo
nents appear to have the two-thirds
majority needed to override his veto
and permanently block the sale.
The revolt, which included 225
House Democrats and 131
Republicans, reflected a growing dis
satisfaction in Congress with Saudi
Arabia's continued alliance with radi

cal Arab nations and a strong fear
that the lawmakers themselves might
be blamed if U.S.-made missiles are
ever used by terrorists against
Americans in the Middle East.
Rep. Mel Levine (D-Calif.), who
led the fight in the House, noted that
the arms package being sought by the
Saudis included the shoulder-held
Stinger missile — a weapon he char
acterized as "a terrorist's delight."
He questioned why the United States
should provide such missiles to an
Arab nation that, he said, resists
American efforts to bring peace to
the Middle East.
"If the Saudis want our coopera
tion, then let them give us theirs," he
said.
Levine said that the overwhelming
margin in both chambers proves that
opponents of the sale can easily
muster a two-thirds majority needed
to override Reagan's threatened veto.

"It's clear that this margin is veto
proof," he said.
In the House, opponents need a
maximum of 290 votes to override —
or 69 fewer than were cast against the
sale yesterday. The Senate vote
exceeded a two-thirds majority by six
votes.
Under law, the president has the
power to proceed with any foreign
military sale unless both chambers of
Congress vote against it. Then, if he
vetoes the resolution of disapproval,
it can be overriden by a two-thirds
vote of both chambers.
The arms sale dispute arises just a
few months before the Saudis were
expected to take possession of five
AW ACS spy planes that were ap
proved by Congress in 1981 after a
tumultuous legislative battle. Oppo
nents of this sale are expected to
mount a similar battle against the
AW ACS transfer.

The proposed $354 million sale
would provide the Saudis with addi
tional supplies of three types of weap
ons that they already have in their ar
senal: 1,666 Sidewinder air-to-air
missiles, 200 Stinger ground-to-air
missiles with 600 reloads, and 100
Harpoon air-to-sea missiles.
Those are only a fraction of the
weapons that the Administration had
originally hoped to sell to the Saudis.
The package was scaled down in an
ticipation of congressional opposi
tion. Earlier this year, the president
withdrew his request to sell arms to
Jordan instead of suffering a defeat.
Although Israel opposes all arms
sales to Saudi Arabia, the Israeli
lobby in Washington, known as the
American Israeli Public Affairs Com
mittee, did not work against the sale.
Nor did opponents argue against it on
grounds that it would jeopardize Is
raeli security.
