U.S. reactors scrutinized
WASHINGTON — Simultaneous failure of
primary and emergency cooling systems in a U.S.
nuclear reactor similar to the devastated Cher
nobyl atomic power plant in th.; Ukraine would
damage a third of its core and cause a partial
meltdown but would not result in the kind of dis
aster that struck the Soviet Union, Department
of Energy officials said yesterday.
The assessment, given to a House subcommit
tee and later challenged, was made as the depart
ment accelerated a technical evaluation of nu
clear plants used to produce fuel for atomic war
heads and formed a panel of independent experts
to review operations of the U.S. reactor most like
the stricken Soviet plant.
Of most concern among U.S. reactors in the
wake of the Soviet accident is the Department Of
Energy's N Reactor at Hanford, Wash., which,
like the Chernobyl unit, uses graphite to
moderate the neutron flux in its core and is with
out a reinforced concrete and steel containment
vessel.
Appearing before the House Energy subcom
mittee on energy, conservation and power, de
partment officials maintained that the similarities
are overshadowed by U.S. safety precautions.

"Other than the use of graphite," Assistant
Secretary of Energy Mary Walker said, "the N
reactor bears little similarity to the reactor at
Chernobyl."
John Hunter, director of nuclear energy at the
Department of Energy's Richland, Wash., opera
tions office said studies showed that the confine
ment building in which the N Reactor is housed
would be adequate in case of an accident that
resulted in a loss of coolant.
He acknowledged, however, that in the acci
dent scenario used in the department study,
cooling water continued to flow to the graphite
moderater. Another study is being conducted in
an effort to forecast the effect of losing the
coolant to the moderator as well, but Hunter
said: "In my personal judgment as an engineer, it
is not going to change things very much .... The
flow of graphite cooling is very low."
Bid for Saga Corp. made
Saga Corp., which owns the Stuart Anderson's
restaurant chain and operates a food service divi
sion that has fed millions of college students, said
late yesterday that Marriott Corp. has made an
offer to purchase all of the company's stock for

$435 million in cash.
Headquartered in Menlo Park, Saga said the
$34-a-share cash offer from the hotel chain was
unsolicited. Saga has 12.8 million shares of com
mon stock outstanding.
The offer was $4.50 a share higher than Saga's
$29.50-a-share closing price Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange, where 128,700
shares traded.
"Marriott is actively in the contract food
services business," explained Michael G. Muel
ler, an analyst who follows restaurants and
lodging businesses for Montgomery Securities in
San Francisco. "Saga is extremely well positioned
in that area, with good market position in the
faster growing segments that Marriott would find
attractive. That would be what I see as the major
fit between the two companies."

NEW YORK (AP) — The stock market gave

A selloff in International Business Machines
