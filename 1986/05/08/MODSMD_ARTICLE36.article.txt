Miller evidence barred
LOS ANGELES â€” Attorneys for an FBI
agent on trial for espionage lost a key legal round
yesterday as the judge barred them from asking a
Soviet woman about statements she has made in
the past absolving Richard Miller of guilt.
U.S. District Judge David Kenyon said he felt
Svetlana Ogorodnikov had "a very clear motive
to fabricate" when she told authorities that Mil
ler never gave her classified documents.
"I think to allow these statements in would be
just flying in the face of the entire reason for the
rule (barring statements based on fabrication),"
the judge said. "There is just no showing of any
sense of reliability."
The defense had sought to use what they call
prior consistent statements to challenge Ogorod
nikov's admission that she told the judge through
her attorneys at the time of her guilty plea that
Miller had passed documents.
Millers attorney. Joel Levine, noted that on
three separate occasions, either Ogorodnikov or

her lawyer said that no documents had been
passed.
Ogorodnikov has insisted she worked for the
FBI, not the KGB, and has said outside the pres
ence of the jury that Miller "is not a traitor."
Miller, 47, the only FBI 4gent ever charged
with spying, is accused of conspiring with her and
husband Nikolay Ogorodnikov to pass classified
documents to the Soviets in exchange for prom
ises of $65,000 in cash and gold.
Tsunami warning passes
A tsunami warning for the California shoreline
prompted thousands of coastal residents to seek
higher ground yesterday, but no large wave
arrived and authorities eventually lifted the
warning saying none was expected.
Before the threat diminished, Coast Guard
vessels were ordered to sea, coastal counties
enacted emergency plans and authorities ordered
the evacuation of about half the 3,000 residents

of Crescent City, where a tsunami was blamed for
14 deaths after the Good Friday quake in Alaska
in 1964.
Yesterday's warning followed a temblor esti
mated at 7.7 on the Richter scale that shook the
Aleutian Islands at 2:47 p.m. California state
emergency workers spent the next several hours
waiting to see if another deadly wave would hit
the coast.
Even as it lifted the warning at 10:30 p.m., the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center noted that large
waves could still arrive within two hours. But it
said "No destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is
predicted."
Weather vain
Today's weather will be sunny with highs in the
70s. Tomorrow, Stanford enters the 80s. The
tsunami which hit the beaches last night has
passed, so students are encouraged to visit them.
