# DUs to appeal University decision
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
I he president of Delta Upsilon yesterday said he
will appeal the University's decison to revoke the
fraternity's recognition.
Noting that the University based much of its
decision on the past actions of the DUs, Scott
Hartman called the disbanding of the fraternity un
justified.
In a letter to Hartman, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson wrote that the University's
decision stemmed from "violent, destructive,
threatening and utterly uncivil behavior" on the
part of the DUs.
However, Hartman said the University held a
"distorted image" of the DUs based on the actions
of past fraternity members. Although the
destructive image of the DUs is no longer accurate,
it is still "alive and well" in the University, he said.
According to Hartman. the University's precon
ceived notions regarding the DUs prevented it
from recognizing the "dramatic" change in the
people, goals and outlook of the fraternity.
Hartman said the recent events involving the
DUs, including an April 12 incident in which a bur
ning couch was thrown off the third-floor balcony
ol the DU house, were individual actions and did
not represent the true character of the fraternity.

"There's not much collective responsibility in the
recent events," he said.
While the grounds for the appeal have not yet
been established, Hartman said the DUs would
issue a formal appeal sometime next week.
The University disbanded and unhoused the
DUs on Tuesday. The DUs can petition to regain
recognized status in autumn quarter 1988. The ear
liest the DUs can be re-housed is 1990.
As a result of the of the decision, the DUs cannot
meet anywhere on campus as a fraternity or use the
University's name in any way.
In addition to unhousing the fraternity, the Uni
versity mandated that no DU live in the house, lo
cated at 553 Mayfield, for the duration of the
group's suspension.
While the University did not establish when the
DUs must move out of their house, it did reserve
the right to evict the fraternity at any time, Robin
son wrote in the letter. In addition, the house is to
be inspected weekly by officials of the Row
Facilities Office.
According to Rodger Whitney, assitant dean of
Residential Education and director of the Housing
Office, the DU house will become a University
operated co-ed Row House. The house will be
filled with students on the waiting list after Round
II of the housing Draw, he said.
Several DUs said yesterday they believe the Uni

versity's decision to oust them is unfair.
DU Bernie Zaia said his fraternity has long been
the target of unfair attacks by the University.
Calling the decision against the DUs part of the
University's "witch hunt" against the fraternity sys
tem in general, Zaia said the University "set out to
nail the DUs."
Hartman termed the whole process by which the
University evaluated and punished the DUs a
"mock trial." He added that the University has
wanted to kick the DUs off campus for a while.
DU Ted Muftic, a junior, said other fraternities
as well as many dormitories perform destructive,
sometimes anti-social acts. "The only difference is,
they don't get caught," he said.
Although he said the DUs have been treated un
fairly by the University, Zaia said the fraternity
members wanted to leave their house with "a touch
of class."
The morning after the University announced a
decision to disband the Zeta Psi fraternity several
years ago, the offices of Residential Education
were found severely vandalized. The University
never proved, however, that members of the frater
nity were responsible for the attack.
Saying that the DUs have 25 students interested
in pledging the DUs despite the University's deci
sion, junior Marvin Mouchawar said the fraternity
would "thrive off campus."
