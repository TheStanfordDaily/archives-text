# Shinkman to leave Farm
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Christopher Shinkman, who in four years at Stanford
has helped thousands of students find employment in the
private sector, has decided to do likewise.
"I've been telling people for years what it's like to enter
the real world." Shinkman said Tuesday. "Now I'll find
out for myself."
Shinkman. director of the Career Planning and Place
ment Center (CPPC), next month will join Ward As
sociates, a Menlo Park-based firm which supplies job
counseling for senior executives.
Shinkman explained that he found the job offer attrac
tive because it fulfills an interest in corporate work and
allows him "to continue doing things 1 enjoy about my
present work, such as career counseling.
Ward Associates offers one-on-one assistance to upper
level executives who have been laid off because of poor
business conditions, corporate mergers or other reasons.
I he service may be provided by the firm the individual is

leaving as part of a severance package, Shinkman said.
He added that after several interviews with the com
pany he decided it was "a lot easier to tell people how (to
succeed in job interviews) than to do it yourself.
"I'll miss my colleagues. They're a good staff. (The
CPPC) has its own little building, with just the 25 of us
there," Shinkman said.
One reason for the change stems from almost 25 years
of work related to his current position, Shinkman said,
during which time he helped "probably a small army" of
students.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, who is respon
sible for choosing Shinkman's successor, said yesterday
that he will consult the CPPC staff before reaching a deci
sion.
Shinkman came to Stanford in 1982 after serving as
director of the Career Counseling Office at Trinity Col
lege. He has worked within college administrations since
1962, including two years as assistant provost at Johns
Hopkins University.
