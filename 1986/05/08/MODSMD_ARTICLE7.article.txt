# Decision-making policies to be contested by panels
## 
### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Staff writer 
A panel of faculty, staff and stu
dents disenchanted with University
decision-making procedures and
policies will face a panel representing
the administration in an open forum
tomorrow at 7 p.m. in Cubberly Au
ditorium.
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, students Mary Rose and David
Troutt, United Stanford Workers
representative Linda Crouse and
Green Library staff member Lise
Giraud will speak against Stanford's
general decision-making procedures,
the University's handling of union is
sues and the Western Culture pro
gram, according to History Prof. Paul
Seaver, who will serve as moderator.
They will be followed by University
President Donald Kennedy, Faculty
Senate Chairman Elie Abel, Vice
Provost Ray Bacchetti, Director of
Personnel Rob Parker and Director
of Facilities and Services Amy Blue,
who will respond on behalf of the
University.
According to Seaver, each panel

member will speak for approximately
five minutes. The opening speeches
will be followed by 15 to 20 minutes
of exchange among the panelists and
45 minutes of questions from the au
dience.
Seaver said he would have to
depend on the panel members to be
restrained. "1 don't think it'll be a
shouting match, but certainly these
are issues about which people feel
very passionately," he said.
"Very strong statements will be
made. Everybody knows there are
very strong feelings here," he added.
Parker, who was partially respon
sible for organizing the forum, said
the forum was requested by a group
of Stanford community members last
fall to discuss the University's
negotiations with the USW. At that
time, the University declined to hold
the forum during negotiations, but
suggested it take place later in the
year.
"People have a lot to say. I'm
hoping it will be really constructive,"
Parker said.
Troutt, a senior, has a lot to say
about the Western Culture program.

He has been involved in efforts to
revise the program as a member of
the Black Student Union and the
Subcommittee on Gender and
Minority issues for the last three
years. He sees tomorrow's forum as
"a means toward opening debate."
"Western Culture is the educa
tional embodiment of what education
at Stanford is supposed to be about. It
bears a tremendous scholastic bur
den," he said.
Seaver sees the willingness of both
the administration and its critics to
discuss issues in public as a positive
sign. "One of the basic things is to get
people to talk," he said. "(The
forum) is being entered into in a spirit
of hope," he added.
Seaver, Parker and Troutt have no
illusions that one forum will resolve
any deeply rooted emotional
disputes. "We can't take all (the is
sues) up in one evening," Seaver said.
"Our hope is that if it works it will be
possible to have other forums."
"There is certainly a possibility of
other forums if this one turns out
well," Parker said.
