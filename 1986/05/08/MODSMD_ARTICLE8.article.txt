"Unless the law has its sway, we shall live forever in
a world of force under a pall of fear," an American
lawyer who helped prosecute Nazi war criminals in the
Nuremberg Trials of 1946 said last night.
Whitney Harris, whose historical lecture was part of
Stanford's week-long commemoration of the
Holocaust tragedy, said the Nuremberg judges, who
came from France, England, the Soviet Union and the
United States to hear the cases of and pass judgment
upon 22 elite Third Reich members, set a precedent in
international law by asserting basic human rights.
However, Harris said that although the judges ap
pealed to a "moral wisdom" when they defined crimes
against peace and humanity, their words have had little
effect upon the outcome of international affairs.
"As of this time in history, the thermonuclear bomb
has been more effective in keeping peace between the
two superpowers than the Nuremberg decision," he
said.
"Most of us who have participated in the Nuremberg
decision have been disillusioned in this respect."
Harris said the United States' chief prosecutor at
Nuremberg, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jack
son, was eminently responsible for organizing the In
ternational Military Tribunal, Nuremberg's judicial
body, under American common law principles.
Jackson's negotiations with the British, French and
Soviets resulted in the London Charter in August of
1945, which established the organizational and
philosophical frameworks by which the internationally

represented tribunal would conduct the trials, Harris
said.
One of the issues that needed clarification through
negotiation was how to treat the criminals, either as
men assumed as guilty and already ready for sentenc
ing, or as accused individuals awaiting judgment.
According to Harris, Jackson asserted that despite
the atrocities attributable to the Nazis, each individual
case merited its own judgment.
Quoting from Jackson's opening statement for the
prosecution, Harris said, "We must never forget that
the record upon which we judge these defendants
today is the record by which we will be judged tomor
row."
Harris echoed Jackson's concern for fairness in crim
inal hearings.
"We can't convict people by assumption. In Nurem
berg, we had to get evidence. In some cases we failed,"
he said.
In his assignment to present evidence against Ernst
Kaltenbrunner, the former head of the Nazi's Security
Police, Harris succeeded.
Although he was only able to procure a single piece
of evidence against Kaltenbrunner, an execution order
bearing his authorization signature was found on the
floor of a former police headquarters in Prague,
Czechoslovakia by an assistant; Harris succeeded in
the prosecution.
"He should have been executed, and he was," he
said.
While in Nuremberg for the trials, Harris inter
viewed many of the Nazi party's most notorious mem
bers, including political leader Rudolf Hess.
