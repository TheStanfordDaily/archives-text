is more convenient. Your choice.
You'd discover the world's largest test
prep research staff
You'd discover the most up-to-date
materials. And with them you'd gain
confidence using our proven effective test
taking techniques.
You'd discover the most comprehensive
computerized diagnostic program for
evaluating LSAT readiness.
You'd discover our unique Introduction to
Law School, an optional seminar that gives
you a head start on that tough first year.

students' first choice for LSAT pfep-and other
companies' first choice for imitation.
