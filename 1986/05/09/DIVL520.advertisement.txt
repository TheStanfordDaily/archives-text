ODYSSEY: THE NEW INTERNSHIP DATABASE IMIIIIIIIIIfllll!lllllllltlll!lllllllllllllllllllllllllll!ll!lt
Odyssey is the name of the new computerized database of internship opportunities that will
greatly facilitate your search for the internship that is "just right. Odyssey looks and works very
much like Socrates, the online library catalog, with a Guided mode to aid new users in searching,
and a Command mode for more experienced users.
You can search the file using any combination of indexes or search criteria, such as subject field
(e.g. newspapers, marketing, computers), location (e.g. local, international. New York) and
organization (IBM or the City of Palo Alto, for example). You can also specify whether you want a
summer position and/or one with monetary compensation.
