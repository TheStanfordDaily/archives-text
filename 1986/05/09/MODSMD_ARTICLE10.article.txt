# Wall climbing forbidden here
## 
### 
As of yesterday, climbing the
walls of University buildings
will not be permitted.
According to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington,
anyone observed climbing will
be asked for identification and
warned. Subsequent offenders
could face campus disciplinary
action and misdemeanor
trespass or vandalism charges,
he said.
Jennifer Westerlind of the
Legal Office drafted the official
statement which reads as fol
lows: "Stanford University
policy prohibits climbing on the
surface of any campus
structure, including walls,
arches and arcades. This policy,
effective immediately, is
promulgated for reasons of
personal safety and to protect
campus structures from
damage and/ or defacement"
Appearing as early as 1978,
the wall climbers use chalk,
special shoes and bare hands to
test their rock climbing skills.
Warning signs will be posted
in the more popular climbing
sites such as the Main Quad
rangle and the Art Depart
ment.
