# SWOPSI board to change program's staffing patterns
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
In response to a controversial University plan to
reconstruct the administrative staff of Innovative Aca
demic Courses (lAC), the SWOPSI Program Board
has recommended an alternative staffing pattern for
SWOPSI that would increase student and community
imput.
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, and current I AC Faculty Director Jack
Winkler, professor of classics, originally announced the
idea of restructuring the I AC staff in March. They out
lined a plan that included laying off the current
SWOPSI administrative staff and the hiring of a
"scholar-activist" Ph.D. to run the program.
According to Michael Lighty, chairman of the
SWOPSI Program Board, the board has been able to
extend the layoff dates for the current staff members
until late June. While Lighty noted that although the
current staff remains laid off, the board was able to
make other recommendations for substantive changes
in the staff pattern that he believes the University is ac
cepting.
"We formed a new position for a graduate student so
that there would be an outlet for grad students to
become involved," Lighty said. "We reduced the fac
ulty director's role from half time to quarter time, and

we created a position for a person with broad commu
nity activist experience and administrative ability."
The IAC is an umbrella organization that
administers SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops for Politi
cal and Social Issues), the Undergraduate Special
Courses and the Freshman-Sophomore Seminars.
According to current SWOPSI Student Co-director
Betsy Jelliffe, "I think the proposals made by the pro
gram board are really fine. Their recommendations are
good ones that will be in keeping with the spirit of the
program."
Soon after the announced restructuring, the program
board was asked to review the staffing pattern at IAC
because "many students and community members ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the decision to fire the cur
rent I AC staff," according to Lighty.
"Not only was the decision unpopular, but it posed a"
credibility problem that nobody was consulted in the
process," he said.
According to Lougee, the decision to reorganize the
I AC staff was spurred by a report made by the Arrow
Commission. That group, led by Economics Prof. Ken
neth Arrow, reviewed five extra-departmental pro
grams. In a report issued in summer 1984, the commis
sion praised the SWOPSI program and its staff but
raised concerns that SWOPSI courses "were not as
rigorous and demanding academically as other Stan
ford courses."
