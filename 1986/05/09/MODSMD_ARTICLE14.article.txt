## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Divestiture long overdue 
### 
Earlier this year. South African President P.W.
Botha claimed "the concept of apartheid is an
outdated one," but his apartheid policies are still quite
real.
Cynical notions that apartheid is over ignore South
Africa's Group Areas Act, Separate Amenities Act
and denial of voting rights — all based on race. Blacks
like Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu
still have to ride on the back of the bus. The fact that
over 170 South Africans were killed in anti-apartheid
violence last March (the highest fatality rate in two
years) demands that more effective action be taken to
combat the evil of apartheid.
Stanford's policy of "selective divestment" through
the Commission on Investment Responsibility (C-1R)
is now perceived as a sham. The C-IR was founded
nearly a decade ago after over 200 students were ar
rested in an anti-apartheid demonstration in Old Un
ion. However, the C-IR has only once recommended
divestment from a company; and the Stanford Board
of Trustees has never divested $1 — thus making a
mockery of the C-IR bureaucracy.
The C-IR and the trustees now have the chance to
regain their credibility. The C-IR proposed last Friday
that the University divest from Diamond Shamrock
Petroleum and Schumberger Corp. It has found these
two companies guilty of "substantial social injury."
Yet many other companies in Stanford's portfolio
are guilty of the same charge. Stanford invests in 10
companies that do not subscribe to the lax Sullivan
Prineini<»<j. a set of ethical guidelines for businesses

operating in South Africa. Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, a former member of the C-IR,
brought up this issue in the last faculty senate meeting.
He asserted that "there is wide agreement that they
(the Sullivan Codes) constitute an absolute minimum
of behavior below which companies should not fall."
Stanford students believe that all companies in
South Africa are guilty of "substantial social injury."
The advisory referendum that passed by a two to one
majority called for "an immediate commitment to to
tally divest from all companies doing business in South
Africa under apartheid laws." Does student opinon
matter to the trustees?
The long list of colleges divesting is growing ever
longer. Over 80 colleges have at least partially divested
— including Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, Am
herst and even Dartmouth. Stanford sits in lonely,
lowly shame.
The trustees will meet Monday. Students plan
to rally in expectation of divestment action. The divest
ment issue is on the agenda, and students will be
presenting pro-divestment arguments to the trustees.
After months of anti-apartheid student activism, any
divestment measures less than total divestment would
be anti-climatic.
Nonetheless, partial divestment is still necessary if
taken as a first step towards total divestment. A clear
and concrete message that Stanford is against apart
heid should have been sent to South Africa a long time
ago.
