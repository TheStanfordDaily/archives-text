U.S. reactors
are much safer
Media coverage of the Soviet nu
clear adventure has been intensive,
but a few key points seem to be get
ting buried in the usual pointless
chatter. In particular, the major
design differences between American
and Soviet nuclear power plants have
not been clearly presented.
The obvious fact that the Soviets
do not bother with a reactor contain
ment structure has been pointed out
by the media. However, I have yet to
hear it stated that the containment
domes used in the United States have
four-foot thick walls that are nearly as
stron)> as solid steel.
More important, though less ob
vious, a fundamental difference
having to do with reactor core design
has been essentially glossed over. If
space permitted, the function of what
is called the "moderator" would be
explained: suffice it to say, however,
that the moderator is the reactor core
and is absolutely essential in order for
the primary fission reaction to occur.
• The moderator in almost all U.S.-
*built reactors is water — the same
Iwater that acts as the core coolant.
Since the moderator and the coolant
'are one and the same, if the coolant is
[accidentally lost, the main fission reac
tion must necessarily cease - regard
less of whether any safety gadgets
'Junction properly or not. Unfortun
ately, the fission products continue to
"generate enough heat to melt the re
* actor core, but only if the triply
•redundant emergency core cooling
Hsystem does not activate for some
'reason. Nevertheless, the fission
«products decay rapidly; within one

hour the heat generated is down to one
one-thousandth of what it was imme
diately after the loss of coolant, and
the meltdown threat is over if it has
not yet occurred (or is more con
trollable if it has). This and other very
robust safety features were designed
into U.S. reactors long before the
anti-nuclear activists started med
dling.
In the Soviet reactors, the
moderator and coolant are not the
same, hence an accidental loss of
coolant can lead to a far more serious
situation where the main fission reac
tion continues — and with no con
tainment building.
Finally, one theory that should cer
tainly be dismissed in light of the So
viet nuclear fiasco is the sacred
dogma of the anti-nuclear political
activist groups that "capitalist greed"
is to blame for the supposed cutting
of corners on safety at U.S. nuclear
power plants.

James Roche stated in a recent let
ter to The Daily that, as a 12-week
old fetus can be differentiated from a
baked potato, prudence dictates the
fetus deserves the benefit of the
doubt. In his letter (April 29), Roche
extended his argument, in response to
a Daily editorial (April 23), by
elaborating his belief that the fetus
must be seen as an infant (in most
cases).
The attitude we will outline here is
primarily based in the legal realm of
the abortion issue and is not meant to

contradict, but to preserve, each indi
vidual's moral decision about abor
tion.
For those who missed the talk
given by pro-choice activist Bill
Baird, yet read Roche's commentary,
let us reiterate the argument we share
with Baird. The debate surrounding
the viability of a fetus as a person is as
yet unresolved and may never be, and
therefore it must not be considered a
point regulated by law.
The point before birth at which life
commences is a decision individuals
make using their own unique morals
and values. Another choice concern
ing the body that individuals make
using their own unique morals and
values is whether they will receive
blood transfusions. Jehovah's Wit
nesses subscribe to a moral code
which forbids blood transfusions.
Should this belief limit the choice of
all members of society? We should
hope not. In a free society, it is essen
tial not to let the morality of a group
of people impinge upon the rights of
all people.
According to Roche's argument, a
fetus would be given rights before a
most-certainly alive and conscious
woman would be.
Paraphrasing Roche's analysis, we
come to a different conclusion:
"Given the difficulty of determining
when exactly life begins, prudence
dictates" that this matter remain
strictly an individual choice.

ting buried in the usual pointless
chatter. In particular, the major
design differences between American
and Soviet nuclear power plants have
not been clearly presented.
The obvious fact that the Soviets
do not bother with a reactor contain
ment structure has been pointed out
by the media. However, I have yet to
hear it stated that the containment
domes used in the United States have
four-foot thick walls that are nearly as
stron)> as solid steel.
More important, though less ob
vious, a fundamental difference
having to do with reactor core design
has been essentially glossed over. If
space permitted, the function of what
is called the "moderator" would be
explained: suffice it to say, however,
that the moderator is the reactor core
and is absolutely essential in order for
the primary fission reaction to occur.
• The moderator in almost all U.S.-
*built reactors is water — the same
Iwater that acts as the core coolant.
Since the moderator and the coolant
'are one and the same, if the coolant is
[accidentally lost, the main fission reac
tion must necessarily cease - regard
less of whether any safety gadgets
'Junction properly or not. Unfortun
ately, the fission products continue to
"generate enough heat to melt the re
* actor core, but only if the triply
•redundant emergency core cooling
Hsystem does not activate for some
'reason. Nevertheless, the fission
«products decay rapidly; within one

hour the heat generated is down to one
one-thousandth of what it was imme
diately after the loss of coolant, and
the meltdown threat is over if it has
not yet occurred (or is more con
trollable if it has). This and other very
robust safety features were designed
into U.S. reactors long before the
anti-nuclear activists started med
dling.
In the Soviet reactors, the
moderator and coolant are not the
same, hence an accidental loss of
coolant can lead to a far more serious
situation where the main fission reac
tion continues — and with no con
tainment building.
Finally, one theory that should cer
tainly be dismissed in light of the So
viet nuclear fiasco is the sacred
dogma of the anti-nuclear political
activist groups that "capitalist greed"
is to blame for the supposed cutting
of corners on safety at U.S. nuclear
power plants.

Right to choose
James Roche stated in a recent let
ter to The Daily that, as a 12-week
old fetus can be differentiated from a
baked potato, prudence dictates the
fetus deserves the benefit of the
doubt. In his letter (April 29), Roche
extended his argument, in response to
a Daily editorial (April 23), by
elaborating his belief that the fetus
must be seen as an infant (in most
cases).
The attitude we will outline here is
primarily based in the legal realm of
the abortion issue and is not meant to

contradict, but to preserve, each indi
vidual's moral decision about abor
tion.
For those who missed the talk
given by pro-choice activist Bill
Baird, yet read Roche's commentary,
let us reiterate the argument we share
with Baird. The debate surrounding
the viability of a fetus as a person is as
yet unresolved and may never be, and
therefore it must not be considered a
point regulated by law.
The point before birth at which life
commences is a decision individuals
make using their own unique morals
and values. Another choice concern
ing the body that individuals make
using their own unique morals and
values is whether they will receive
blood transfusions. Jehovah's Wit
nesses subscribe to a moral code
which forbids blood transfusions.
Should this belief limit the choice of
all members of society? We should
hope not. In a free society, it is essen
tial not to let the morality of a group
of people impinge upon the rights of
all people.
According to Roche's argument, a
fetus would be given rights before a
most-certainly alive and conscious
woman would be.
Paraphrasing Roche's analysis, we
come to a different conclusion:
"Given the difficulty of determining
when exactly life begins, prudence
dictates" that this matter remain
strictly an individual choice.
