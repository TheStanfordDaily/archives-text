## Theme houses preserve ethnic identity 
### 
I am a freshman and I have read various
criticisms that staff, administrators and students
have had on the purpose of theme houses here on
campus. 1 would like to offer my personal insight
on the need for these houses in hopes that this con
troversy will cease. I currently live in Ujamaa, the
black theme house on campus. I myself, being
black, feel a great need for the existence of this
house and I would like to bring these reasons to the
attention of everyone concerned.
I am from a predominantly black inner-city area
of Southern California where not many people
even attend college, much less universities as elite
as Stanford. Being from such an area, I expected an

. overwhelming culture shock coming to Stanford.
* However, when I arrived here and moved into my
* residence 1 was immediately put to ease at meeting
. people who could realistically relate to my situa
* tion.
These people, many of them black, had the same
. reservations and fears that I had about coming to
I Stanford. They explained to me that Ujamaa had
* been a great help in their adjustment to college life.
* Once here for a quarter. I found this to be true.
* After being here two quarters. I learned that not
) only was Ujamaa a place that helped me "fit in."
* but a place that prevented me from assimilating.
Ujamaa has helped me retain my individuality and
i yes. my ethnicity.
By living in Ujamaa. I learned things about my
* black heritage that I had never known before. I
learned about the trials others had gone through to

get me and others like me to institutions like Stan
ford. Living in Ujamaa made me appreciate things
like black dance, art, music, literature and other
things which have always been disregarded by soci
ety. Living in Ujamaa made me proud to say, "I'm
a black woman."
As for the argument that theme houses promote
segregation, little can be said in support of such a
claim. Sure, the majority of occupants in theme
houses share the same ethnicity (or are supposed

to), but this is the purpose of the house itself. It ap
pears funny to me that when large numbers of
black students congregate in one place it's called
"segregation." but when white students do the
same it's called "diversity."
I can't understand why Stanford continues to
pride itself on being a culturally diverse institution
while people within the University continue tocon
demn students for learning about their ethnic heri
tage. When black students try to explore and learn

about their culture they are prevented or deterred
by one method or another. But when white stu
dents learn about their heritage, it's a distribution
requirement— Western Culture!
Another flaw in the arguments given by oppo
nents of theme house existence is the claim that the
houses prevent occupants from exploring other
cultures. This is surely absurd! It is clear that the
theme houses are the few places that students can
come to learn about those respective cultures. If it
weren't for the houses, many times students would
probably get no exposure to the cultures what
soever, being that Stanford does not have a
"requirement" making it mandatory that students
learn about the cultures of Asians, Africans or
Mexicans.
Another fact is that the programs these houses
put on are always open to all Stanford students, and
many times the theme houses even support each
others' programs. How does this alienate the Stan
ford community?
One who does not know the facts should learn
them before one makes false claims. Theme house
existence is clearly essential to the diversity of the
Stanford community. Without them this would
truly be a "white-washed" institution where as
similation, not integration, was the goal. I am of
fended that there are people in our own community
(Stanford) who actually see theme houses as
paragons of segregation instead of diversification.
These very people should examine their own ways
of life to see if they have ever entered the parts of
campus where diversity actually takes place. I'm
sure if they did they would understand the necessity
of these houses.

weren't for the houses, many times students would
probably get no exposure to the cultures what
soever, being that Stanford does not have a
"requirement" making it mandatory that students
learn about the cultures of Asians, Africans or
Mexicans.
Another fact is that the programs these houses
put on are always open to all Stanford students, and
many times the theme houses even support each
others' programs. How does this alienate the Stan
ford community?
One who does not know the facts should learn
them before one makes false claims. Theme house
existence is clearly essential to the diversity of the
Stanford community. Without them this would
truly be a "white-washed" institution where as
similation, not integration, was the goal. I am of
fended that there are people in our own community
(Stanford) who actually see theme houses as
paragons of segregation instead of diversification.
These very people should examine their own ways
of life to see if they have ever entered the parts of
campus where diversity actually takes place. I'm
sure if they did they would understand the necessity
of these houses.

When black students
congregate it's called
"segregation," but when
white students do the
same it's called
"diversity."
