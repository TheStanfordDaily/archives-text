# Widen Western Culture

Aime Cesaire — sometimes called the father of
"Negritude" — recalls in his "Discourse on Colonialism"
a French writer s assertion that "civilization has never yet
been made except by whites." Ironically, this may not be
altogether off the mark, if we argue that the very concept
of "civilization" was developed by 19th-century white
Europeans to describe their own society.
The action of civilizing — as in Voltaire's phrase,
"Contact with the Greeks civilized the barbarians"—
already could imply cultural fringe benfits of conquest,
but it was probably not until the 19th century that
Europeans identified what they had come to call
"civilization" with themselves.
Programs in Western Civilization or Culture tend to be
ethnocentric. They review the achievements of a society
dominated by upper-class white males, which has
developed a tradition of identifying its origins in the
Judeo-Christian Bible and ancient Roman and Greek cul
ture.

This is a society that came to full consciousness of itself
in the industrial mid-19th century, and it is thus axiomatic
that it should be limited to Western Europe and its over
seas prolongations, mainly the United States. Indeed, the
great material success of "Western Civilization" may very
well be inseparable from the phenomenon of European
colonialism and its ideological justification as la mission
civilisatrice (or "the white man's burden").
Thus, a conspicuous problem of such programs stems
"from the contradiction of insisting that this geographically
centered, sexually centered, racially centered, class
centered and even religiously centered cultural package
be imposed as our tradition in a society that claims to be
color-blind, multi-racial and sexually non-discriminatory.
Obviously, those who have been aculturated from
childhood with a sense of spiritual and even genetic kin
ship with the traditional heroes of Europe's intellectual
past will have few problems adjusting to this sort of pro
gram — at least until they start thinking seriously about its
implications. Others may not accept its preconceptions so
easily.
That brings us to the first charge that can be leveled
against architects of such programs: insensitivity to the
feelings of those who are led to perceive themselves as
outsiders to be "assimilated" into the dominant culture
and who resent this, or are psychologically harmed by the
implication of cultural inferiority. Included can be blacks
and other people of color, women of any color and
children of the poor, regardless of sex or color.
Such programs also present Western European culture
from a skewed perspective. It is seen only from the
"inside," not from the point of view of those who often
feel more like its victims than the recipients of its largesse.
To be sure, the writers chosen for study include several
critics like Rousseau and Marc. But it requires voices
from the Third World to express directly the feelings of
those who have seen their European conquerors not as
civilizing missionaries, but as practitioners of enslavement

and exploitation.
A non-partisan presentation of what Paul Valery called
"Tesprit european" would have to set beside Shake
speare's and Petrarch's love sonnets the ways in which
Europe (and the United States) legitimized the conquest
of power. For the intellectual history of western Europe
and the United States is very much a story of the ideologi
cal legitimation of dominance — over people, over other
species and over all of nature.
The university teaching profession is almost entirely
composed of academic achievers — mostly white and
mostly male — who are steeped in the cultural lore in
which they got their first high marks when they were
schoolchildren.
As the years pass in academe, it becomes increasingly
difficult for them to liberate themselves from the concep
tual word in which they have found much mutual rein
forcement. Contrary to popular belief, the university is
not a nurturing environment for radical perspectives.
In fact, the very resurgence of programs in Western
Civilization — not only at Stanford but all over the
country — is not unrelated to our universities' victory
over the threat that radicalism posed to academic author
ity in the 19605, when a coalition of students and faculty
questioned, among many other things (like the war in
Vietnam, for example), the sanctity of the traditional cur
riculum, including, of course, Western Culture.
Compulsory courses in Western Civilization were
reborn from the ashes of that radical movement in both
Europe and the United States. They tend to assert the
relatedness of the present to the past — not so much in
dialectical fashion as a negation to be negated, but rather
as a continuum. All too often, the past is seen as a tradi
tion to be assimilated and identified with. Such programs
inevitably arouse temptations to rehabilitate the past
rather than use critical understanding of it in the creation
of a new society free of the shibboleths of the past.
Internalization of society's traditional self-evalutioncan
promote resistance to social and political change. This
may help explain why Western Culture programs have
been so generally reinstated, among other elements of
structured learning, together with the weakening or out
right elimination of programs in which students had
sought to secure some measure of control over their own
education.
What to do? Requirement of one course on a non-
Western culture has been a modest step forward, but if the
three-quarter Western Culture sequence remains un
changed, so does the root of the problem. Parallel se
quences of Western and non-Western culture courses to
be taken at the student's choice amount to "separate but
equal facilities" a ghettoization of cultures. Replacement
of the "Western" Culture program with one that sets
European-American civilization in historical and intel
lecutal context with the rest of the world, expunging all
kinds and levels of chauvinism — cultural, racial and
sexual — may be the most difficult option, but surely the
one most consistent with the ideal of education for
democracy.
