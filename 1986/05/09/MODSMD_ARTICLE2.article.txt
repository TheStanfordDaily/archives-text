# C-US considers world culture
## Committee awaits BSU proposal 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Although Western Culture will un
dergo no major changes next year,
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) has postponed its
evaluation of the current program so
that the Black Student Union (BSU)
can develop proposals to incorporate
the contributions of women and
minorities into the requirement.
According to Carolyn Lougee,
dean of Undergraduate Studies and
an ex-officio member of the commit
tee, there is "absolutely no chance
that the program will be changed next
year." But Lougee added that West
ern Culture "will gain at least some
characteristics of a world culture pro
gram" in the near future.
Time constraints make it
impossible to restructure Western
Culture or even alter next year's
mandatory core reading list, Lougee
said.
But she added, "I'm sure the C-US
will take a step in the right direction"
by moving toward restmcturing the
program.
The BSU addressed the issue two
weeks ago with a letter to the com
mittee charging that "the current
Western Culture program is a dis
service to the Stanford community
because of its failure to acknowledge
the contributions and impact of
women and people of color on Amer
ican and European culture."

In response to the letter and a
report from its Subcommittee on
Women and Minorities, C-US sched
uled a two-hour discussion of the
Western Culture requirement for its
meeting yesterday.'
But the BSU asked that the issue
be postponed until the May 21
meeting in order to have more prepa
ration time, and C-US concurred.
"The committee showed a great
deal of concern," Lougee said. "I
take the postponement of the issue as
a sign they are listening."
The BSU will present a detailed
course outline for what it refers to as
an "American Culture" spring quar
ter class, open to students from any
Western Culture track, that will focus
on the history and interaction of
minorities in the United States, ac
cording to newly elected BSU Chair
person Amanda Kemp.
The BSU is working with a number
of professors to develop the course,
which will be modeled after similar
classes offered at UC-Berkeley, she
added.
Louis Ford, the BSU vice chairper
son, added, "Starting with this one
quarter class is a way of 'testing the
waters,' of finding out what will work,
so we can move toward solving a fun
damental problem of the Western
Culture requirement."
C-US plans a "thorough examina
tion" of BSU proposals, according to
committee chairman Marsh McCall,
professor of classics.
In yesterday's meeting, C-US
passed a resolution saying it
"recognizes the force of the issues
that have been brought to its atten
tion concerning the Western Culture
program and commits itself to the
thorough examination of those is
sues."
Lougee said C-US recommen
dations could range from"the mini
mal — adding materials to the
reading list — to a complete restruc
tiirinp of the program."
Any proposals would then be for
warded to the Western Culture Sub
committee of the Faculty Senate and
could be considered at the senate's
June 12 meeting, she said.
Lougee, who teaches a history
Western Culture track, said there was
"no chance" the proposals could
make it through the channels in time
to affect next year's courses.
On Monday, May 20, the BSU and
the Department of Undergraduate
Studies will host an open forum at 7
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium to discuss
proposed restructuring of the West
ern Culture program. The forum is to
feature C-US members and Western
