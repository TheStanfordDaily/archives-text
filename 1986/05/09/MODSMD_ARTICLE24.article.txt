## Special kids give Olympian effort 
### VLADINA HESS Staff writer 
"Let me win. But if I cannot win,
let me be brave in the attempt."
This is the national motto of the
Special Olympics, which will bring
some 250 developmentally disabled
athletes from around the Bay Area to
compete in the Stanford Special
Olympics swim meet tomorrow at
DeGuerre pool.
The primary purpose of the Stan
ford Special Olympics, according to
Special Olympics committee member
Kelly McAleese, a senior, is to "give
developmentally disabled athletes the
opportunity to participate in a com
petitive event that would not nor
mally be accessible to them. Just as
important is the opportunity for the
volunteers to learn about people who
are developmentally disabled and to
realize that cognitive ability is just
one small aspect of personhood."
The day will begin at 7:45 a.m.
when student volunteers will be
matched with athletes. According to
committee member Dana Beatty,
also a senior, approximately 350 stu
dent volunteers will be needed this
year.
Some volunteers, according to
Beatty, will act as "buddies," or
chaperones, accompanying athletes
to their events and cheering them on.
Other volunteers will be active ser
ving food or playing in the bands.
About half of the volunteers have
worked as Special Olympics volun
teers before and half of them are new,
according to McAleese. "The experi
enced athletes often lead the first
time volunteers through the events,"
she said.
The Olympics consist of various
swim events, including the 25- and
50-meter freestroke, backstroke and
breaststroke. Also planned are in
nertube waterpolo and other races.
Athletes participate in several
events and everyone is given a medal
for participation. Prizes are awarded
to those placing first through seventh
in the various events.
In between events, there will be
plenty of activities for the athletes, in
cluding earth ball, frisbee and paint

ing, said McAleese. LSJUMB and
four other bands will provide enter
tainment through the day.
According to Beatty, the Stanford
Special Olympics were started about
five years ago in coordination with
the Santa Clara County Special
Olympics.
Beatty attributed the success of the
Olympics to the increased interest of
people in public service. Added
McAleese, "It's the volunteers who
make this event possible."
According to Beatty, the event is
completely non-profit. Each year, the
Stanford Business School sponsors
the MBA Challenge for Charity, a
10K run which raised over $1,000
this year. In addition, the Olympics
raise funds through dorm solicita

tions.
The money, Beatty added, goes to
pay for buttons, lunches, T-shirts and
entertainment.
Maria DeLaßosa, a sophomore,
was a volunteer at last year's Special
Olympics and is a member of Stan
ford's softball team.
"People get charged up" about the
event, she said. "You're excited be
cause they're excited. As an athlete, I
like watching and helping someone
be an athlete."
McAleese noted that being a
"buddy" is "one of the most reward
ing things people can do — most
people who volunteer do it again.
Some people have commented that
they don't know what to expect; we
shouldn't be afraid to acknowledge

that there are differences (between
the athletes and the volunteers). But
we can go on from there and see if we
can learn something. The athletes
have a lot to teach us."
Beatty agreed. "You learn a lot
about yourself and how you deal with
people" when volunteering, she said.
Said McAleese, "It's competitive
sport, but everyone is competing
against themselves, and when com
peting against yourself, everyone is a
winner."
Anyone interested in being a
volunteer with the Special Olympics
can go to DeGuerre Pool tomorrow
at 7:45 a.m. Otherwise, all are en
couraged to come out and show their
support and participate in entertain
ment activities.
