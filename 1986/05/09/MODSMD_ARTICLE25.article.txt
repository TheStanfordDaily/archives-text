It amazes me the things academics will
argue about.
If Western Culture is supposed to help
freshmen understand the foundations of their
socio-politico-aesthetico-philosophico
tapioca world then it should be based not on
Plato or Laotse or even the imaginative Vat
syayana, but on those porcelain platitudes
from the Tidy Bowl Man.
It's just a matter of timeliness. Who does
the coffee generation identify with more, Fred
Rated the Federated Group guy or young
Werther?
Even Hesiod admitted things change.
I had an epiphany in The Store the other
day; I realized that our whole culture is based
on various whitening agents. As 1 dropped a
tube of Crest Gel (regular flavor) in the bas
ket with the deodorant, the Clorox, the Oxy
-10 facial scrub and the decorator-colored
Kleenex, I realized how appalling it was.
(And yes, if William Satire or Edwin New
man want to complain about my word choice,
I really do mean appalling in the true sense of
the word, "to become or to render white.")
I never really understood what an epiphany
was — the literary equivalent of an orgasm
maybe — but by the time we got to Joyce, I
had stopped doing the reading anyway; a
moral, if not epiphanous, decision.
Was I the only one who was annoyed by
that word, "moral "?
Living in a SLE dorm, the act of salting
one's sunny-side-ups had moral ramifications

on top of the usual sodium side effects.
No one ever dared to label anything
////moral, though. (They'd ship you off to
Brigham Young for that.)
But everything possessed varying degrees
of morality — the pink tile in the bathrooms,
the "Wanda Whips Wall Street" flicks shown

in some guys' room down the hall, the length
of one's tube socks and the choice of folding
or rolling them for storage in a drawer.
This was all possible thanks to our profes
sors' gleeful refusal to define their favorite
"mot juste" (that's French for cliche). It got
to where the idea of morality made me
positively nervous.
The greatest effect of the Western Culture

reading list on me was my deepened apprecia
tion of Robert Heinlein and Tom Robbins,
writers who don't bury their ideas in so much
Sominex.
By the end of my freshman year I could
argue with great confidence that St.
Augustine's pears, Circe s pigs and whole

what 1 would propose to replace the current
system.
The only works in translation would be
symbolic of our transient culture:
"Please do not disturb. Priere ne pas
deranger. Bitte nicht storen. No disturbe por
favor. Non disturbare per favore."

armies of überminsches and Lotus Eaters
should be locked away in Plato's parabolic
cave along with the Underground Man and
Kafka's roaches.
So obviously there's a need for reform,
either of Western Culture or of my attitude
toward it. Just so I don't sound like a whiner,
some loser who wouldn't even think David
Letterman is funny, I should probably explain

I just don't see how Plato's Symposium
could ever compare to this modern discourse:
Interlocutor: Do you need anybody?
Sage: I need somebody to love.
I: Could it be anybody?
S: I want somebody to love.
I: Would you believe in love at first sight?
S: Yes, I'm certain it happens all the time.
I: What do you see when you turn out the

light?
S: 1 can't tell you, but 1 know it's mine. Yes,
I get by with a little help from my friends.
Yes, Socrates, I must agree, you've been • •
outdone.
Who would ever read Boccaccio, explicit
though he was for his day, when you can just
as easily tune in on "Falcon Crest"?
My version of Western Culture would lead
the student to enlightenment about his society
through contemplation of sayings much like
the old Zen riddles, only I'd call them but
tered pop koans.
Picture walking in for the first day of class
to find your professor doing the standing
crane in a Glad Wrap loin cloth, intoning
"What is the sound of one Rice Krispies guy
snap-crackle-popping?"
For the final you'd be told to stand in a cor
ner and endeavor not to think about Yogi the
Bear trying not to think about a pic-a-nic bas
ket.
To sum up, in conclusion, and thus, West
ern Culture is a misnomer as things stand
now, since the course really doesn't deal with
culture as it is lived here in California today
(and what else is the West?). We should be
teaching freshmen about the forefront of our
own familiar, tacky Americana, the Big Boy
statue that puts the ooh-mao-mao into your
smile, child, where citizens shamelessly wear
Hard Rock Cafe paraphenalia in public and
slap bumper stickers from Hussong's Cantina
in Ensenada, Mexico and In-N-Out Burger
on their vehicles.
I'm glad I could settle that one; look for the
cure of the common cold next Friday.

I had an epiphany in The Store the other day;
I realized that our whole culture is based on
various whitening agents. As I dropped a tube
of Crest Gel (regular flavor) in the basket
with the deodorant, the Clorox, the Oxy-lO
facial scrub and the decorator-colored
Kleenex, I realized how appalling it was.
