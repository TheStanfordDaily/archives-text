## Take a ride to a restaurant in the redwoods 
### MAD MAX SUGAREE 
The Mountain House
13808 Skyline Blvd.
Woodside
851-8541
The Harley engine was winding out at full
throttle as Mad Max and his Motorcycle Mama,
Sugaree, navigated the hairpin turns of Skyline
Boulevard. Decked out in their finest leathers, they
knew exactly where they were headed to consume
their weekend feast — The Mountain House.
For some, this hideaway may be hard to find. It's
located about five miles north of Highway 35 on
Skyline Boulevard. But it's familiar turf for Max.
He knows where to take his Sugaree.
Max parked the chopper, and the couple stepped
out of the forest and into the rustic inn. The sharply
dressed maitre'd escorted them to their usual table,
which overlooked a floodlit grove of giant red
woods.
Max turned to Sugaree. "Shall we start with a
bottle of that 1982 Camus Zinfandel? I enjoyed its
hearty oaky flavor last week." Her smile indicated
a positive response, and the maitre'd was off.
To go with the wine ($l2), the couple enjoyed
some appetizers.
Max's favorite was the order of spring rolls with
hot mustard sauce ($3.95). They appeared piping
hot and were stuffed with bean sprouts, cabbage,
peas, corn and pork. Everything was fresh and
could be identified, unlike the inside of some of
those foreign egg rolls that Max disliked.
But Sugaree's stomach was waiting for the fried
calamari ($4.25). A generous portion of the little
guys came with the typical butter and lemon dip,
seasoned with just the right amount of garlic and

parsley. The tender yet chewy morsels were
complemented by a thick and crunchy batter. (A
little too battery in Max's opinion).
As the waitress refilled the two wine glasses, Max
eagerly awaited the next course. He knew what was
to appear.
The salads. Max summed up the situation when
he exclaimed: "Absolutely one of the best salad
dressings I've ever had in my whole life." Perhaps it
was this incredible creamy vinaigrette that kept
drawing Max back to the Mountain House. Or
maybe it was God's perfection of celery, labeled as
"jicama" by the waitress, that capped the amazing
salad experience. Even after the salad makings had
disappeared, the couple fended off the busboy in
order to mop up the remaining puddle of dressing
with fresh bread.
While awaiting the main courses, Sugaree turned
to her man and said, "Max, honey — I don't know
if we'll both be able to fit on that 750 of yours after
eating all this yummy food. Oh boy, here come our
entrees."
The waitress deposited two piping hot plates in
front of the already satiated couple. Max had or
dered the sliced leg of lamb in Zinfandel marinade
($ 11.75), while Sugaree opted for the lighter mahi
mahi with basil hollandaise sauce ($12.50). Both
entrees were broiled over mesquite to give them
that slight barbecue flavor, and came served with
string beans, carrots and spring potatoes.
The couple sat in silence for the next five
minutes, happily devouring their food. Max, with a
small piece of carrot stuck in his beard, turned to
Sugaree and said, "This lamb is great It's crispy on
the outside, yet hot and juicy all the way through.
The Zinfandel marinade is very unassuming, and
accents the already flavorful lamb. How's the
fish?"

Sugaree looked away for a second, as she tried to
casually swallow an enormous mouthful of food.
"This mahi-mahi reminds me of that swordfish we
had at Maxim's," she said. "It's a little lighter than
a sword, but still quite meaty, and not at all flaky.
The sauce is what really makes this dish, though.
The hollandaise is thoroughly inundated with basil,
and almost resembles a thick pesto. I really like it"
Max looked up and smiled as he pushed his
empty plate away. He said, "I'm glad we found a
place that we both enjoy. I know it's a long ride
from Los Angeles for dinner, but I've never been
disappointed here. Shall we finish up with some of
that killer chocolate mousse?"
Sugaree put down the plate that she had been
licking, and nodded in agreement. Their waitress,
having overheard the short exchange, disappeared
in search of dessert and coffee. The busboy
cautiously cleared the empty plates and refilled the
water and wine glasses. The wind outside rustled
the branches of the giant redwoods, as laughter
wafted in from the bar. Everyone was content.
In fact, Max and Sugaree would better be des
cribed as ebullient, especially after they dug into
the chocolate mousse ($2.95). Sugaree turned to
Max and said, "Honey, why don't we dust L. A. and
move up here. It would save us a lot of gas money."
With a glint in his eye, Max replied, "Hmmm.
Then I suppose we could finally try The Mountain
House's Sunday brunch — served outside on the
patio. Great idea, Sugaree."
And our fictitious couple lived happily ever after.
The story you have just read is true, although the
names have been changed to protect no one in par
ticular. One thing that's true for sure — The Moun
tain House is a great restaurant.
