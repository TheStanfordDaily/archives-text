# Vacation in a Victorian way
## 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN 
To most people, finding a hotel in
San Francisco for themselves or for
out-of-town guests means choosing
between the uncountable clone
chain hotels the City has to offer.
However, for those who are tired of
cold, impersonal hotel lobbies the
size of international airport termi
nals, there is an option.
There now exists a growing num
ber of small bed and breakfast
hotels in the heart of San Francisco.
At last, visitors will no longer have
to slumber with a revolving bar
overhead.
Directly across from scenic
Golden Gate Park stands the Vic
torian Inn on the Park. This spec

tacular belvedere-towered mansion
was originally built in 1897 and has
earned a title as an official regis
tered historic landmark. Today, inn
keepers Lisa and William Benau
have restored the house to retain its
Victorian charm and essence.
The mansion has a mere 12 guest
rooms, each decorated in 1890s an
tique style. The rooms are tastefully
decorated and come with fresh
flowers, beautiful comforters, down
pillows and a private bathroom.
Phones and televisions are available
upon request. Several of the
guestrooms have private fireplaces.
Obvious concern was taken during
the house's recent restoration to
retain and revise the late-19th cen
tury elegance.

Lisa and William invite guests to
make themselves at home and relax
in the sitting room or library. They
serve wine and sherry to guests each
evening at 5 p.m. in the parlor. Each
morning guests come down to the
oak-paneled dining room to share in
a sumptuous breakfast of fresh or
ange juice, fruit and coffee. William
spends the early morning hours
baking fresh croissants and bread
for his guests. A morning edition of
the paper is also provided.
The Benaus purchased and
remodeled the mansion in 1980.
Lisa gave up her job as a city district
attorney and opened the inn to ful
fill a dream of being her own boss.
Today the Benau's obvious, care for
the comfort of their guests is paying

off. The small size of Victorian Inn
on the Park enables William and
Lisa to provide guests with that ex
tra personal touch.
Whether you require a chilled
bottle of champagne waiting in your
room, tickets to that evening sym
phony performance or a chauf
feured limousine to take you on a
tour of the city, the Benaus know
how to arrange it.
The Inn is located across from
Golden Gate Park. It is less than
five minutes from the Civic Center
and museums, 10 minutes to down
town and within 15 minutes of al
most anywhere else in San Fran
cisco. Guestrooms start at $75
night. Fqj- reservations,, caH (415)-'
