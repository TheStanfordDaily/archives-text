Rashomon (1950)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Often men won't speak the truth
even to themselves," says one of the
characters in Akira Kurosawa's un
forgettable film, and — adapting a
story by Akutagawa —■" the director
sets out to prove that the truth is un
discoverable. The plot is devilishly
simple: a bandit (Toshiro Mifune)
robs a noble (Masayuki Mori) in the
forest and rapes his wife (Machiko
Kyo); the noble dies — at the ban
dit s hands or at his own. Kurosawa
plays the story four times, communi
cating the perception of each of the
major characters and that of a wood
cutter (Takasi Shimura) who claims
to have witnessed the entire episode.
Machiko Kyo, later the Lady Mac
beth of Kurosawa's "Throne of
Blood," gives a remarkably versatile
performance.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday
with "Kagemusha."
Trouble in Mind (1986)
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
This film noir pastiche seems to be
taking place entirely inside the head
of writer/director Alan Rudolph.
The story is set in Rain City, but we
can immediately recognize the artifi
cial movie-movie world of "One
from the Heart" and "Moon in the
Gutter," where the characters are
straight from a filmmaker's fantasy
and aren't expected to act like any
thing human. Rudolph's creations
are amalgams of every 1940s noir
character ever put on film; they
spout crypto-tough guy philosophy
— some of it quite funny — which
the audience can't even begin to fig
ure out, and they move in random
patterns that play against the por
tentous, fatalistic atmosphere. For a
filmmaker whose previous projects
were models of almost obssessive
control, much of this movie is pretty
sloppy (especially the conclusion);
none of the actors look like they
have a clue what's going on. With
Kris Kristofferson (woefully mis
cast), Genevieve Bujold, Keith Car
radine, Lori Singer, Divine and Joe
Morton.
Plays this week with "My Beauti
ful Laundrette."
A Chorus Line (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Utter tripe. The play is, I'm told,
an effective piece of staging, but this
movie exposes all that is phony

about the material: the stagy angst,
the self-aggrandizing stereotypes
and the maudlin bathos of the con
trived life stories — it's all up there,
on the wide screen and in Dolby.
The play is, of course, about 17
chorus line hopefuls required to bare
their souls to a tyrannical Broadway
director (played by Michael
Douglas, whose performance is one
of the movie's worst offenses). The
material is engineered to squeeze
heartstrings cross-generationally
and cross-culturally; it's an integra
ted 1940s bomber crew of emotional
trauma and triumph. The movie was
perpetrated by director Richard At
tenborough, adapter Arnold Schul
man and choreographer Jeffrey
"Flashdance" Hornaday. Charles
McGowan and Gregg Burge are the
only chorus line members who are
allowed to display any talent.
Plays Sunday night.
Danton (1983)
Cubberley Auditorium
Gerard Depardieu's Danton, the
French Revolution leader whose last
days this film chronicles, is a sen
sualist and a star — he knows he en
joys the idolatry of the Parisians and
he plays up to them as well as
playing hard-to-get with them. He
has the savvy of a celebrity. Depar
dieu has said that he used Muham
mad Ali as a role model for some of
Danton's flourishes, and (as usual)
his instincts served him well: Danton
is a champion, even in defeat (i.e.
under the guillotine). The Polish
filmmaker Andrzej Wajda's film,
written by Jean-Claude Carriere and
others, is a vigorous historical spec
tacle that gives the constant impres
sion of forward motion. Wajda's
passionate sweep and his recognition
of the farcical element embedded in
any grand gesture may not add up to
great history, but they are a welcome
relief from the usual cautious ap
proach taken by the makers of his
torical epics. The supporting cast
includes two of the luminaries of the
Parisian stage, directors Patrice
Chereau and Roger Planchon.
Plays Tuesday night.
F/X(1986)
Palo Alto Square Cinemas, Palo
Alto
This who-is-doing-what-to-whom
suspense thriller is modestly stylish,
but very lightweight. It has a nifty
central idea: a special effects man is

hired hy some shifty government
agents to fake an assassination to
protect an endangered government
witness against the mob. He stages
the killing, but then finds that a
whole bunch of people are out to get
him. The rest of the plot doesn't live
up to the expectations created in the
first half-hour; the story line is obvi
ously padded to fill two hours, and
the movie resolves itself into one
rather mundane double cross. The
performers — a surprisingly skillful

group — include Bryan Brown,
Diane Venora, Brian Dennehy and
Cliff De Young. Efficiently directed
by Robert Mandel and written by
Robert Megginson and Gregory
Flee man.
Plays this week with "Gung Ho."
An American in Paris (1951)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
In a year that yielded "A Streetcar
Named Desire," "A Place in the
Sun" and"The African Queen." the
Academy Award for best picture
went to this sunny MGM musical,
written by Alan Jay Lerner and di
rected by Vincente Minnelli. The
film was built around the music of
George Gershwin (lyrics, of course,

by Ira), and though its planned high
light, a 20-minute ballet to the
"American in Paris" suite designed
in the styles of half-a-dozen Impres
sionist painters, is overloaded and
pretentious, the rest of it is truly in
the Gershwin spirit. (The songs in
clude " 'S Wonderful," "Tra-la-la,"
"I Got Rhythm" and "By Strauss.")
Gene Kelly got the quintessential
Gene Kelly role as the American
painter in Paris; he dances a
memorable pas de deux with Leslie

Caron to "Love is Here to Stay."
With Oscar Levant, Nina Foch and
Georges Guetary.
Plays this Sunday.
Kagemusha: The Shadow Warrior
(1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa produced
this epic of Shakespearean scope
about a thief in 16th-century Japan
who must act as the double of a war
lord (Tatsuya Nakadai plays both
roles.) Kurosawa draws on all the
styles he has embraced in 37 years of
filmmaking: in subject matter, the
movie takes him back to his samurai
pictures, but the battle scenes, mag
nificent as they are, are enriched

with the humanism that has emerged
in his work since the mid-19505.
They seem like immense and tragic
canvases that David or Delacroix
might have painted.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday
with "Rashomon."
Gung Ho (1986)
Palo Alto Square Cinemas, Palo
Alto
Director Ron Howard s unin-

spired comedy is about what hap
pens when a Japanese car
manufacturer sets up a factory in
Slobsville, USA; it's a clever prem
ise. but the movie looks like it came
off an assembly line. The East
meets-West cast of caricatures is
headed by Michael Keaton and
Gedde Watanabe. Both are adept at
a kind of frenetic, harried physical
comedy, and they are really the only
reason to see the movie, which is
very forgettable (you forget it while
you're watching it). The screenplay
is by Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and
Babaloo Mandel (the gang who
wrote the much more enjoyable
"Splash!").
Plays this week with "F/X."

Lolita (1962)
The Red Vic, San Francisco
Though it was almost universally
dismissed on its release as a
watering-down of the novel — a
novel, incidentally, that had been
reviled in many quarters of publica
tion — Stanley Kubrick's black com
edy is possibly his best movie.
Vladimir Nabokov did his own
adaptation, retaining a surprising
amount of the verbal wit of the
original, and the cast could hardly be
better: James Mason as Humbert
Humbert, lover of nymphets; Shel
ley Winters as pretentious, clinging
Charlotte Haze; and best of all,
Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. None
of them has ever surpassed their
work in this movie. The film is over
long, structurally flawed and drably
photographed, but it is nevertheless
one of the best American movies of
the 19605. With Sue Lyon as Lolita.
Plays tonight and tomorrow.
Turtle Diary (1986)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows
more affection for novelist Russell
Hoban's epigrammatic characters
than he has for anyone in his movies
in quite some time. Glenda Jackson
and Ben Kingsley are two painfully
recessive types leading lives of utter
loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three
large sea turtles from the London
Zoo; it's the biggest adventure of
their lives, and it transforms them
(slightly). The movie is long on a
kind of petrified British charm, and
it unfolds at a leisurely, bordering on
torpid, pace; the stars appear to
have been chosen primarily for their
resemblance to the turtles (they
aren't required to do much acting).
Pinter and director John Irvin dis
sect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays this week.
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
Pagoda Theatre, San Francisco
This black comedy about the se
ries of blunders leading to a nuclear
war is one of the high points of
American film writing: few
screenplays can compare to what
Terry Southern, Stanley Kubrick
and Peter George have accom
plished here. It is one of Kubrick's
best movies — and his last unpreten
tious, energetic one.
Plays Thursday.

Machiko Kyo, later the Lady Mac
beth of Kurosawa's "Throne of
Blood," gives a remarkably versatile
performance.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday
with "Kagemusha."
Trouble in Mind (1986)
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
This film noir pastiche seems to be
taking place entirely inside the head
of writer/director Alan Rudolph.
The story is set in Rain City, but we
can immediately recognize the artifi
cial movie-movie world of "One
from the Heart" and "Moon in the
Gutter," where the characters are
straight from a filmmaker's fantasy
and aren't expected to act like any
thing human. Rudolph's creations
are amalgams of every 1940s noir
character ever put on film; they
spout crypto-tough guy philosophy
— some of it quite funny — which
the audience can't even begin to fig
ure out, and they move in random
patterns that play against the por
tentous, fatalistic atmosphere. For a
filmmaker whose previous projects
were models of almost obssessive
control, much of this movie is pretty
sloppy (especially the conclusion);
none of the actors look like they
have a clue what's going on. With
Kris Kristofferson (woefully mis
cast), Genevieve Bujold, Keith Car
radine, Lori Singer, Divine and Joe
Morton.
Plays this week with "My Beauti
ful Laundrette."
A Chorus Line (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Utter tripe. The play is, I'm told,
an effective piece of staging, but this
movie exposes all that is phony

about the material: the stagy angst,
the self-aggrandizing stereotypes
and the maudlin bathos of the con
trived life stories — it's all up there,
on the wide screen and in Dolby.
The play is, of course, about 17
chorus line hopefuls required to bare
their souls to a tyrannical Broadway
director (played by Michael
Douglas, whose performance is one
of the movie's worst offenses). The
material is engineered to squeeze
heartstrings cross-generationally
and cross-culturally; it's an integra
ted 1940s bomber crew of emotional
trauma and triumph. The movie was
perpetrated by director Richard At
tenborough, adapter Arnold Schul
man and choreographer Jeffrey
"Flashdance" Hornaday. Charles
McGowan and Gregg Burge are the
only chorus line members who are
allowed to display any talent.
Plays Sunday night.
Danton (1983)
Cubberley Auditorium
Gerard Depardieu's Danton, the
French Revolution leader whose last
days this film chronicles, is a sen
sualist and a star — he knows he en
joys the idolatry of the Parisians and
he plays up to them as well as
playing hard-to-get with them. He
has the savvy of a celebrity. Depar
dieu has said that he used Muham
mad Ali as a role model for some of
Danton's flourishes, and (as usual)
his instincts served him well: Danton
is a champion, even in defeat (i.e.
under the guillotine). The Polish
filmmaker Andrzej Wajda's film,
written by Jean-Claude Carriere and
others, is a vigorous historical spec
tacle that gives the constant impres
sion of forward motion. Wajda's
passionate sweep and his recognition
of the farcical element embedded in
any grand gesture may not add up to
great history, but they are a welcome
relief from the usual cautious ap
proach taken by the makers of his
torical epics. The supporting cast
includes two of the luminaries of the
Parisian stage, directors Patrice
Chereau and Roger Planchon.
Plays Tuesday night.
F/X(1986)
Palo Alto Square Cinemas, Palo
Alto
This who-is-doing-what-to-whom
suspense thriller is modestly stylish,
but very lightweight. It has a nifty
central idea: a special effects man is

hired hy some shifty government
agents to fake an assassination to
protect an endangered government
witness against the mob. He stages
the killing, but then finds that a
whole bunch of people are out to get
him. The rest of the plot doesn't live
up to the expectations created in the
first half-hour; the story line is obvi
ously padded to fill two hours, and
the movie resolves itself into one
rather mundane double cross. The
performers — a surprisingly skillful

group — include Bryan Brown,
Diane Venora, Brian Dennehy and
Cliff De Young. Efficiently directed
by Robert Mandel and written by
Robert Megginson and Gregory
Flee man.
Plays this week with "Gung Ho."
An American in Paris (1951)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
In a year that yielded "A Streetcar
Named Desire," "A Place in the
Sun" and"The African Queen." the
Academy Award for best picture
went to this sunny MGM musical,
written by Alan Jay Lerner and di
rected by Vincente Minnelli. The
film was built around the music of
George Gershwin (lyrics, of course,

by Ira), and though its planned high
light, a 20-minute ballet to the
"American in Paris" suite designed
in the styles of half-a-dozen Impres
sionist painters, is overloaded and
pretentious, the rest of it is truly in
the Gershwin spirit. (The songs in
clude " 'S Wonderful," "Tra-la-la,"
"I Got Rhythm" and "By Strauss.")
Gene Kelly got the quintessential
Gene Kelly role as the American
painter in Paris; he dances a
memorable pas de deux with Leslie

Caron to "Love is Here to Stay."
With Oscar Levant, Nina Foch and
Georges Guetary.
Plays this Sunday.
Kagemusha: The Shadow Warrior
(1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa produced
this epic of Shakespearean scope
about a thief in 16th-century Japan
who must act as the double of a war
lord (Tatsuya Nakadai plays both
roles.) Kurosawa draws on all the
styles he has embraced in 37 years of
filmmaking: in subject matter, the
movie takes him back to his samurai
pictures, but the battle scenes, mag
nificent as they are, are enriched

with the humanism that has emerged
in his work since the mid-19505.
They seem like immense and tragic
canvases that David or Delacroix
might have painted.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday
with "Rashomon."
Gung Ho (1986)
Palo Alto Square Cinemas, Palo
Alto
Director Ron Howard s unin-

spired comedy is about what hap
pens when a Japanese car
manufacturer sets up a factory in
Slobsville, USA; it's a clever prem
ise. but the movie looks like it came
off an assembly line. The East
meets-West cast of caricatures is
headed by Michael Keaton and
Gedde Watanabe. Both are adept at
a kind of frenetic, harried physical
comedy, and they are really the only
reason to see the movie, which is
very forgettable (you forget it while
you're watching it). The screenplay
is by Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and
Babaloo Mandel (the gang who
wrote the much more enjoyable
"Splash!").
Plays this week with "F/X."

Lolita (1962)
The Red Vic, San Francisco
Though it was almost universally
dismissed on its release as a
watering-down of the novel — a
novel, incidentally, that had been
reviled in many quarters of publica
tion — Stanley Kubrick's black com
edy is possibly his best movie.
Vladimir Nabokov did his own
adaptation, retaining a surprising
amount of the verbal wit of the
original, and the cast could hardly be
better: James Mason as Humbert
Humbert, lover of nymphets; Shel
ley Winters as pretentious, clinging
Charlotte Haze; and best of all,
Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. None
of them has ever surpassed their
work in this movie. The film is over
long, structurally flawed and drably
photographed, but it is nevertheless
one of the best American movies of
the 19605. With Sue Lyon as Lolita.
Plays tonight and tomorrow.
Turtle Diary (1986)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows
more affection for novelist Russell
Hoban's epigrammatic characters
than he has for anyone in his movies
in quite some time. Glenda Jackson
and Ben Kingsley are two painfully
recessive types leading lives of utter
loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three
large sea turtles from the London
Zoo; it's the biggest adventure of
their lives, and it transforms them
(slightly). The movie is long on a
kind of petrified British charm, and
it unfolds at a leisurely, bordering on
torpid, pace; the stars appear to
have been chosen primarily for their
resemblance to the turtles (they
aren't required to do much acting).
Pinter and director John Irvin dis
sect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays this week.
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
Pagoda Theatre, San Francisco
This black comedy about the se
ries of blunders leading to a nuclear
war is one of the high points of
American film writing: few
screenplays can compare to what
Terry Southern, Stanley Kubrick
and Peter George have accom
plished here. It is one of Kubrick's
best movies — and his last unpreten
tious, energetic one.
Plays Thursday.

Rashomon (1950)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Often men won't speak the truth
even to themselves," says one of the
characters in Akira Kurosawa's un
forgettable film, and — adapting a
story by Akutagawa —■" the director
sets out to prove that the truth is un
discoverable. The plot is devilishly
simple: a bandit (Toshiro Mifune)
robs a noble (Masayuki Mori) in the
forest and rapes his wife (Machiko
Kyo); the noble dies — at the ban
dit s hands or at his own. Kurosawa
plays the story four times, communi
cating the perception of each of the
major characters and that of a wood
cutter (Takasi Shimura) who claims
to have witnessed the entire episode.
Machiko Kyo, later the Lady Mac
beth of Kurosawa's "Throne of
Blood," gives a remarkably versatile

character ever put on film; they
spout crypto-tough guy philosophy
— some of it quite funny — which
the audience can't even begin to fig
ure out, and they move in random
patterns that play against the por
tentous, fatalistic atmosphere. For a
filmmaker whose previous projects
were models of almost obssessive
control, much of this movie is pretty
sloppy (especially the conclusion);
none of the actors look like they
have a clue what's going on. With
Kris Kristofferson (woefully mis
cast), Genevieve Bujold, Keith Car
radine, Lori Singer, Divine and Joe
Morton.
Plays this week with "My Beauti
ful Laundrette."
A Chorus Line (1985)
Memorial Auditorium
Utter tripe. The play is, I'm told,
an effective piece of staging, but this
movie exposes all that is phony

about the material: the stagy angst,
the self-aggrandizing stereotypes
and the maudlin bathos of the con
trived life stories — it's all up there,
on the wide screen and in Dolby.
The play is, of course, about 17
chorus line hopefuls required to bare
their souls to a tyrannical Broadway
director (played by Michael
Douglas, whose performance is one
of the movie's worst offenses). The
material is engineered to squeeze
heartstrings cross-generationally
and cross-culturally; it's an integra
ted 1940s bomber crew of emotional
trauma and triumph. The movie was
perpetrated by director Richard At
tenborough, adapter Arnold Schul
man and choreographer Jeffrey
"Flashdance" Hornaday. Charles
McGowan and Gregg Burge are the
only chorus line members who are
allowed to display any talent.
Plays Sunday night.
Danton (1983)
Cubberley Auditorium
Gerard Depardieu's Danton, the
French Revolution leader whose last
days this film chronicles, is a sen
sualist and a star — he knows he en
joys the idolatry of the Parisians and
he plays up to them as well as
playing hard-to-get with them. He
has the savvy of a celebrity. Depar
dieu has said that he used Muham
mad Ali as a role model for some of
Danton's flourishes, and (as usual)
his instincts served him well: Danton
is a champion, even in defeat (i.e.
under the guillotine). The Polish
filmmaker Andrzej Wajda's film,
written by Jean-Claude Carriere and
others, is a vigorous historical spec
tacle that gives the constant impres
sion of forward motion. Wajda's
passionate sweep and his recognition
of the farcical element embedded in
any grand gesture may not add up to
great history, but they are a welcome
relief from the usual cautious ap
proach taken by the makers of his
torical epics. The supporting cast
includes two of the luminaries of the
Parisian stage, directors Patrice
Chereau and Roger Planchon.
Plays Tuesday night.
F/X(1986)
Palo Alto Square Cinemas, Palo
Alto
This who-is-doing-what-to-whom
suspense thriller is modestly stylish,
but very lightweight. It has a nifty
central idea: a special effects man is

hired hy some shifty government
agents to fake an assassination to
protect an endangered government
witness against the mob. He stages
the killing, but then finds that a
whole bunch of people are out to get
him. The rest of the plot doesn't live
up to the expectations created in the
first half-hour; the story line is obvi
ously padded to fill two hours, and
the movie resolves itself into one
rather mundane double cross. The
performers — a surprisingly skillful

group — include Bryan Brown,
Diane Venora, Brian Dennehy and
Cliff De Young. Efficiently directed
by Robert Mandel and written by
Robert Megginson and Gregory
Flee man.
Plays this week with "Gung Ho."
An American in Paris (1951)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
In a year that yielded "A Streetcar
Named Desire," "A Place in the
Sun" and"The African Queen." the
Academy Award for best picture
went to this sunny MGM musical,
written by Alan Jay Lerner and di
rected by Vincente Minnelli. The
film was built around the music of
George Gershwin (lyrics, of course,

by Ira), and though its planned high
light, a 20-minute ballet to the
"American in Paris" suite designed
in the styles of half-a-dozen Impres
sionist painters, is overloaded and
pretentious, the rest of it is truly in
the Gershwin spirit. (The songs in
clude " 'S Wonderful," "Tra-la-la,"
"I Got Rhythm" and "By Strauss.")
Gene Kelly got the quintessential
Gene Kelly role as the American
painter in Paris; he dances a
memorable pas de deux with Leslie

Caron to "Love is Here to Stay."
With Oscar Levant, Nina Foch and
Georges Guetary.
Plays this Sunday.
Kagemusha: The Shadow Warrior
(1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa produced
this epic of Shakespearean scope
about a thief in 16th-century Japan
who must act as the double of a war
lord (Tatsuya Nakadai plays both
roles.) Kurosawa draws on all the
styles he has embraced in 37 years of
filmmaking: in subject matter, the
movie takes him back to his samurai
pictures, but the battle scenes, mag
nificent as they are, are enriched

with the humanism that has emerged
in his work since the mid-19505.
They seem like immense and tragic
canvases that David or Delacroix
might have painted.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday
with "Rashomon."
Gung Ho (1986)
Palo Alto Square Cinemas, Palo
Alto
Director Ron Howard s unin-

spired comedy is about what hap
pens when a Japanese car
manufacturer sets up a factory in
Slobsville, USA; it's a clever prem
ise. but the movie looks like it came
off an assembly line. The East
meets-West cast of caricatures is
headed by Michael Keaton and
Gedde Watanabe. Both are adept at
a kind of frenetic, harried physical
comedy, and they are really the only
reason to see the movie, which is
very forgettable (you forget it while
you're watching it). The screenplay
is by Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz and
Babaloo Mandel (the gang who
wrote the much more enjoyable
"Splash!").
Plays this week with "F/X."

Lolita (1962)
The Red Vic, San Francisco
Though it was almost universally
dismissed on its release as a
watering-down of the novel — a
novel, incidentally, that had been
reviled in many quarters of publica
tion — Stanley Kubrick's black com
edy is possibly his best movie.
Vladimir Nabokov did his own
adaptation, retaining a surprising
amount of the verbal wit of the
original, and the cast could hardly be
better: James Mason as Humbert
Humbert, lover of nymphets; Shel
ley Winters as pretentious, clinging
Charlotte Haze; and best of all,
Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. None
of them has ever surpassed their
work in this movie. The film is over
long, structurally flawed and drably
photographed, but it is nevertheless
one of the best American movies of
the 19605. With Sue Lyon as Lolita.
Plays tonight and tomorrow.
Turtle Diary (1986)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows
more affection for novelist Russell
Hoban's epigrammatic characters
than he has for anyone in his movies
in quite some time. Glenda Jackson
and Ben Kingsley are two painfully
recessive types leading lives of utter
loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three
large sea turtles from the London
Zoo; it's the biggest adventure of
their lives, and it transforms them
(slightly). The movie is long on a
kind of petrified British charm, and
it unfolds at a leisurely, bordering on
torpid, pace; the stars appear to
have been chosen primarily for their
resemblance to the turtles (they
aren't required to do much acting).
Pinter and director John Irvin dis
sect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays this week.
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
Pagoda Theatre, San Francisco
This black comedy about the se
ries of blunders leading to a nuclear
war is one of the high points of
American film writing: few
screenplays can compare to what
Terry Southern, Stanley Kubrick
and Peter George have accom
plished here. It is one of Kubrick's
best movies — and his last unpreten
tious, energetic one.
Plays Thursday.

Rashomon (1950)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Often men won't speak the truth
even to themselves," says one of the
characters in Akira Kurosawa's un
forgettable film, and — adapting a
story by Akutagawa —■" the director
sets out to prove that the truth is un
discoverable. The plot is devilishly
simple: a bandit (Toshiro Mifune)
robs a noble (Masayuki Mori) in the
forest and rapes his wife (Machiko
Kyo); the noble dies — at the ban
dit s hands or at his own. Kurosawa
plays the story four times, communi
cating the perception of each of the
major characters and that of a wood
cutter (Takasi Shimura) who claims
to have witnessed the entire episode.
Machiko Kyo, later the Lady Mac
beth of Kurosawa's "Throne of
Blood," gives a remarkably versatile
performance.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday
with "Kagemusha."
Trouble in Mind (1986)
Aquarius Theatre, Palo Alto
This film noir pastiche seems to be
taking place entirely inside the head
of writer/director Alan Rudolph.
The story is set in Rain City, but we
can immediately recognize the artifi
cial movie-movie world of "One
from the Heart" and "Moon in the
Gutter," where the characters are
straight from a filmmaker's fantasy
and aren't expected to act like any
thing human. Rudolph's creations
are amalgams of every 1940s noir
character ever put on film; they
spout crypto-tough guy philosophy
— some of it quite funny — which
the audience can't even begin to fig
ure out, and they move in random
patterns that play against the por
tentous, fatalistic atmosphere. For a
filmmaker whose previous projects
