## 'Latino' tars U.S. policies with broad brush 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
' It's hard to know what to say about
■a' film like Haskell Wexler's
"Latino," which, despite all its faults,
is something you sense everybody
should see. "Should" is the key word
here, because "Latino" is the kind of
Uncompromising movie that allows
•rfo shades of moral equivocation in its
'strictly black-and-white spectrum.
' The 1985 film (shown in Cubberley
Auditorium by the Chicano Student
Activities Committee and El Centro
to a capacity crowd last Thursday
qight), which as of yet has apparently
been dropped like a hot potato by
every film distributor it's been shown
to, is a proudly one-sided depiction of
the conflict between the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua and the
U.S.-financed contra rebels trying to
'topple it from across the border in
Honduras. The side of the die this
story lands up on is that of the Sandi
nistas — in no uncertain terms.
Director Wexler's vehicle for this
decidedly polemic film is to couch it
in a plot about a single individual
tangled up in the moral web of the
struggle. Should work like a well
worn charm, right? Well, not always.
And that's what had this reviewer
gnawing at his lip throughout the
'film.
The individual, in this case, is Ser
geant Eddie Guerrero (Robert
Beltran), a U.S. Army man who's
fought in Vietnam and is primed to
defend his country wherever else it
needs him to go. Guess where they
want him to go this time? And guess
Why the main character just happens
|J) be Hispanic?
* The opening scene of the film takes
advantage of actual news footage of a
IJamlet in Nicaragua bombed out of
jj&istence by the contras. The effect,
supposedly, is to make clear from the

start that this film is not just going to
flirt with documentary-style posing to
get its point across — it's going to hop
right in bed with it.
Then we switch from documentary
scenes of babies crying and smoke as
cending from incinerated huts to
some obviously contrived footage of
Sandinista soldiers being given guns
by their superiors. The mix here isn't
exactly jarring, but it's distracting to
put the burden on the filmgoer to dif
ferentiate between which footage is
real and which isn't.
The time Wexler spent on this artsy
exploit could have been better used
on coming up with some decent
characterization, which — at least in
terms of major characters —
"Latino" utterly suffers from a lack
of. The scene immediately following
the "Big Call to Arms" transports the
audience to the homey East Los An
geles tenement of Guerrero — and
the audience gets hit in the face with a
load of stereotypical characterization.
The biggest problem with
"Latino," ultimately, is not its un
compromising political stance (more
about that later), but its equally
hardheaded unwillingness to part
with the stale and bring in the excit
ing.
Wexler Ls a veteran of filmmaking
— he was the cinematographer for
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest," among others, and he's di
rected or co-directed a dozen
documentaries (including the Oscar
winning 1970 film "Interviews with
My Lai Veterans"). So you'd think
he'd have better sense than to trans
fer the wasteland of the small screen
to the big. Maybe it's because this Ls
only the second feature film he's done
(the first was 1969's "Medium
Cool").
Whatever the causes of the film's
staleness, it almost sinks from the

weight of the cliches it has to bear
through the first one-third or so of its
length. Equal time is given to Guer
rero's involvement with the guerrillas
he's training and to a relationship he
tries to cultivate with a wealthy
Nicaraguan expatriate named Mar
lena (Annette Cardona).
The scenes which focus on the
training sessions and the subsequent
increases in aggressiveness the
contras display are arguably the best
sequences of "Latino." There is a bit
ter authenticity to these scenes that
sends chills up your spine as you
realize what our country might be in
volved in down in Central America
(unless, of course, this film is blind to
the other side of the coin, which is en
tirely possible).
But the relationship between Eddie
and Marlena rings hollow, and you
find yourself becoming grateful that
the focus on this silly relationship
diminishes as Wexler warms to his
political thesis in the second half of

this picture.
The time-honored device of
making the generalities of interna
tional relations hit home by furtneling
them through the experience of a set
of individual people becomes less
than honorable in Wexler's hands. In
fact, it becomes downright nonsensi
cal.
That's because Wexler doesn't take
the whip to Beltran and Cardona —
he lets them drift along in the never
never land of wooden characteriza
tion, where every love scene is a
platitude ("I love you," says Eddie at
one point to Marlena. "At least I
want to.") and every argument an ex
ercise in didactic pretense.
What saves the film, fortunately
(but also what ultimately dogs it), is
its geopolitical bravado. Wexler has
no time for wishy-washiness — the
United States government and mili
tary are clearly the bad guys, and he
tars them with a broad brush.
For example, toward the end of the

movie, a self-important military big
shot tells Guerrero to anonymously
lead an attack on a Sandinista agricul
tural nerve center. The bigshot fig
ures the Nicaraguan response — and
Guerrero's corpse coming back in a
body bag as an Unknown Soldier —
will give the Reagan Administration
the excuse it needs to launch a full
scale invasion.
Guerrero hesitates. He says the
dog tags he wears around his neck are
"like part of my body," and he will
have no part of leading an invasion
without his family being able to know
he was the person who led it.
But the bigshot, who wears
Hawaiian shirts and has old wizened
Honduran women scrubbing his
kitchen floor, puts a decisive arm
around Guerrero and says, "Don't
get me wrong. I think you spies are
great. But it's been decided already.
This is something that's got to be
done."
And, almost predictably, the guy
uses Eddie's relationship with Mar
lena against him, blackmailing him by
mentioning the fact that Marlena's
father is an official in the Sandinista
hierarchy and saying, "My colonel in
Vietnam always told me something.
'It's all right to f-~ them, but don't
talk to them.' "
Thus does Guerrero get persuaded
to lead the attack, and thus are the
lines drawn in "Latino," whose world
is filled with people who have no con
cept of the ambiguity of life, or else
learn the fact too late. When Guer
rero says,"I feel like I've spent my
entire life hiding in the bushes of
some foreign country," you know his
realization isn't going to do him much
good.
Sometimes this approach to
characterization works beautifully. In
one scene, Guerrero angrily weaves
the horse he's riding through a small
group of life-weary penitents carrying

a statue of a blindfolded saint down
the dirt .path of their village. He
demands that they put their statue
down; there's no room for dis
obedience in his mind, even if this
scene might have been similar to oc
currences in Guerrero's presumably
Catholic childhood. The one
mindedness that breeds hardhearted
ness is handled exquisitely in this, one
of the most memorable scenes of
many in "Latino."
But the same approach backfires
once the viewer gets outside the
theater and realizes that very little at
tention has been paid — logically,
given the filmmaker's intent — to the
aspects of Sandinista rule that might
make the U.S. government so desper
ate to stage an invasion in the first
place.
In the final analysis, the very fervor
that compels Wexler to film such as
tonishing portrayals of the ragtag
contra menace divests "Latino" of
much of its credibility, leaving the
viewer feeling raked over and manip
ulated.
But the faults of the film aside —
which are considerable — "Latino" is
a film that should be seen by a wider
audience. Propaganda from Wexler's
side of the political fence comes along
far too rarely in this era of conserva
tive communist-hating, and when it
does (witness the disappearance a few
years back of similarly themed
"Under Fire," which had been in
release for only two weeks), it too of
ten gets swept under the rug, seen as
out of step with popular sentiment.
The same filmgoers who congratu
late themselves with drunken rhetoric
about the capability of America to
stand tall would do well to see this
film, which, like Degas' portraits of
nude women, impressionistically
captures America in a moment —
however fictional — with its pants
down and its pride shamed.
