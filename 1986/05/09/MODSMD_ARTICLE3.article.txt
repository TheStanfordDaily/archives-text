# University seeks 100 endowed chairs
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Stanford plans to establish 100 endowed
professorships as part of the University's
Centennial campaign, University Provost
James Rosse told the Faculty Senate last
week.
The endowed chairs, each carrying a
$1.6 million price tag, are usually gifts
from individuals or couples, said David
Fulton, director of communications for the
Office of Development. Stanford currently
has about 180 endowed chairs among
more than 700 tenured faculty.

The 100 chairs are to include 12 Cen
tennial professorships, faculty which will
primarily serve the often over-taxed inter
disciplinary programs in addition to pro
viding flexibility in general departmental
appointments.
Although the $160 million needed to
endow the 100 chairs is the second largest
single component of the entire campaign,
the goal is "quite realistic," Fulton said.
The Centennial campaign is projected to
net the University more than $490 million
in gifts. The Campus Near West renova
tion project is the largest campaign ob
jective, with a fund-raising goal of $180

million.
According to Rosse, the endowed chairs
will primarily be awarded to faculty mem
bers already at Stanford. JShe prohibitive
costs of adding additional faculty will keep
Stanford from increasing total faculty size
by more than 35, Rosse said.
"An incremental faculty member really
costs us a lot more than $1.6 million,"
Rosse said.
According to Rosse, each additional
professor actually costs the University
about $6.1 million for technical faculty and
about $5.4 million for other disciplines.
Using What he called "back of the en

velope" calculations based on known in
stitutional costs and budgeting, Rosse, an
economics professor, said the combination
of faculty salary, benefits, office and re
search space and other operating costs
rapidly overtake the amount that could be
reasonably attained through fund-raising
efforts.
For example, costs for office, research
and departmental administration space for
technical faculty is about $1.4 million per
professor. Similar space for non-technical
faculty costs about $400,000.
In addition to the costs associated
with new faculty, any additional pro
fessors would also exacerbate the
overcrowded conditions here. Rosse
said.
"We seldom think in those kinds of
terms because it always looks like we
could just stuff another person in,"
Rosse said. "If you stuff enough addi
tional people in, you quickly get to
the kind of situation in which we now
find ourselves. We literally do not
have space for anybody else."
Rosse recommended offering most

of the 35 new appointments to assis
tant professors to alleviate some of
the statistical trends in the makeup of
the Stanford faculty.
Although any new appointments
will have only "modest" effects on
the basic character of the profes
soriate. Rosse said faculty demograph
ics show that there will be a large
number of faculty retirements in the
next 10 years.
In addition to slightly decreasing
the average age of the faculty, Rosse
said the 35 appointments would also
reduce the student-to-faculty ratios in
most disciplines.
"The bottom line is that I think
that we're lean (and) we do need to

add some professorships," Rosse
said.
In comparison to the humanities
and sciences faculty of Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Columbia, Chicago and
Cornell, the Stanford faculty is
slightly smaller than average.
Of all these institutions, only Co
lumbia has a higher student enroll
ment per faculty member ratio than
Stanford.
In the same group, Stanford main
tains a significantly higher total of full
professors and a significantly lower
total of assistant professors, a condi
tion the University hopes to improve
with the new appointments, Rosse
said.
