# University seeks 100 endowed chairs

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Stanford plans to establish 100 endowed
professorships as part of the University's
Centennial campaign, University Provost
James Rosse told the Faculty Senate last
week.
The endowed chairs, each carrying a
$1.6 million price tag, are usually gifts
from individuals or couples, said David
Fulton, director of communications for the
Office of Development. Stanford currently
has about 180 endowed chairs among
more than 700 tenured faculty.

The 100 chairs are to include 12 Cen
tennial professorships, faculty which will
primarily serve the often over-taxed inter
disciplinary programs in addition to pro
viding flexibility in general departmental
appointments.
Although the $160 million needed to
endow the 100 chairs is the second largest
single component of the entire campaign,
the goal is "quite realistic," Fulton said.
The Centennial campaign is projected to
net the University more than $490 million
in gifts. The Campus Near West renova
tion project is the largest campaign ob
jective, with a fund-raising goal of $180

million.
According to Rosse, the endowed chairs
will primarily be awarded to faculty mem
bers already at Stanford. JShe prohibitive
costs of adding additional faculty will keep
Stanford from increasing total faculty size
by more than 35, Rosse said.
"An incremental faculty member really
costs us a lot more than $1.6 million,"
Rosse said.
According to Rosse, each additional
professor actually costs the University
about $6.1 million for technical faculty and
about $5.4 million for other disciplines.
Using What he called "back of the en

velope" calculations based on known in
stitutional costs and budgeting, Rosse, an
economics professor, said the combination
of faculty salary, benefits, office and re
search space and other operating costs
rapidly overtake the amount that could be
reasonably attained through fund-raising
efforts.
For example, costs for office, research
and departmental administration space for
technical faculty is about $1.4 million per
professor. Similar space for non-technical
faculty costs about $400,000.
