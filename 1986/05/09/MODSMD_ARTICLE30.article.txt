Selected tracks from these new
releases will be played Monday night
at 6 on K/.SU-FM (90.1). The ratings
system this week is in projected alter
nate spellings of University President
Donald Kennedy's last name (just in
case the major national media cover

Commencement and break out with
97.4 different versions of it).
Lou Reed: "Mistrial"
Quennedi Quennedi Quennedi
RCA threatened to nullify Lou

Reed's recording contract if he didn't
agree to tint his hair green, wear a
tear-away body suit on his front
cover, get rid of his guitar, and do a
duet with Sheena Easton. But Lou
told them that he'd kick their butts,
so they let him keep his contract, with
a compromise a synthesized drum
track on his new album. And he had
to use the Scorpions' distortion box,
too. But it's okay if he's got a drum
machine and mega-distortion. He still
has his sunglasses and leather jacket.
Characteristically, Lou's new al
bum gives you the sense that he
doesn't care what you think about his
new album. He even does a rap song
and says, "Life's got me nervous/and
a little pugnacious/lugubrious."
Think of that. Lou Reed is
lugubrious. He also has a song called
"Spit It Out." He's so cool.
"Mistrial" doesn't measure up to
the powerful "New Sensations," what
with the drum machine and every
thing, but Lou is still taking some
pretty good punches at society, doing
those gut-wrenching vignettes and
singing about his baby and stuff. If
you could buy just side one and scrap
side two, you would probably be just
fine. Lugubrious Lou. He's so cool.
Siouxsie and the Banshees:
"Tinderbox"
KhennedieKhennedieKhenn
Life must really be a drag in Eng
land. Group after group comes over

seas and glooms up all our alternative
airwaves with their depressing com
mentaries on life, and more often,
death. Here's a couple of happy exr
cerpts for spring quarter Banshee
fans:
"The day drags by like a wounded
animal
"No pity for him, their misery
screams unspeakable things
"Without anaesthetic, it cuts
through tumorous flesh
This is obviously prime tanning
music. Siouxsie's songs have occa
sionally been excellent, most notably
"Christine," "Dazzle" and "Dear

Prudence." But the dungeon-rock on
this album has just got to go. Aside
from the faster, more accessible
"Cities in Dust," the music's power
and pop hooks are gone, leaving only
a gloomy sludge that gums up your
turntable and cartridge and ruins
your stereo.
Our advice to Siouxsie is to cheer

up, shorten and speed up her songs,
and maybe co-write a couple tunes
with ever-peppy Paul McCartney.
She might even be able to slide a
couple of nihilistic messages past us
critics if they're well enough disguised
underneath the shallow, danceable
trend-pop that we like.
The Moody Blues: "The Other Side of
Life"
Ge nnedey Gen nedey
The year is 1995. The world has
been razed by nuclear accidents,
leaving only a small settlement of

humans within a domed city in Vir
ginia. Inside is a society horribly dif
ferent from our own where record
company executives have been killed
off by a teenybopper populist revolt,
and where established bands are
"terminated" if their works do not
meet hit standards.
A crowd gathers in an amphithea

tre and cheers as five aging rockers
ascend into the sky and burst into
flames. Simon, John, Andy, Roger
and Nick all meet their fates after
their unsuccessful "Duran
Du Rarities" comeback attempt. The
festivities over, the crowd of
teenagers disperses to the piped-in
sounds of Sean Lennon and Dweezil
'n' Molly Zappa.
Fortunately for the Moody Blues,
this is not the music world in 1986.
The band, which sported some sup?r
art-psychedelia in the late 19605, and
even a good comeback in 1981 with
"Long Distance Voyager," just
wouldn't survive in the above futuris
tic scenario. Aside from whatever hits
are playing at KFOG, this record is a
worthless self-parody of the Moodies'
sci-fi synth effects, Philadelphia
Cream Cheese harmonies and lyrics
like "baby baby baby."
There is just no need for a record
like this, and we have to feel sorry for
a band that could actually go through
the recording and mixing process
without feeling sufficient guilt to
refrain from releasing the final prod
uct. ,
On the good side, though, if you're
studying and not paying attention to
the songs or words, the album posps
no threat of distraction; and if all else
fails, at least there are only nine more
years until 1995.
