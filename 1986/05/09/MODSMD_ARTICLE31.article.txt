# Grad Kincaid makes film department's first feature
## Ah, the agonies and ecstasies of filmmaking! 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
I his is tlw first in a series of three
a nicies about the milking of a student
film here as pan of the university's
graduate film program. This segment
oj the article covers the background of
the production "The Red Wagon"
and its director, Kincaid Jones; fol
lowing installments will look at the
different jobs on a Jilm crew and the
problems of filming on location in
Menlo Park and San Francisco.
It's 2:30 on a chilly April morning,
and on Arlington Road in Menlo
Park a film shoot is winding down.
An 1 1-person crew has just finished
nearly nine hours of work. Ignoring
the bitter cold, they've overcome
problems in lighting, sound and
camera positioning. The actors have
tirelessly read through their lines
again and again, hoping for a perfect
take. All this effort is for a scene that
will probably last only two or three
minutes on film.
Despite the glittery trappings of the
film world, the actual business of
making a film is not a very glamorous
affair. This is especially true in the
case of student films, where there is
no Hollywood studio executive
throwing fabulous sums of cash
around the set. But while the making
of a student film can often be frustrat
ing and exhausting, there is also a
sense of excitement among the crew
members. In the back of everyone's

mind is one giddy thought: "We're
actually making a movie!"
Everyone present at the Menlo
Park film shoot is there because they
want to be, because they find some
thing uniquely satisfying and fascinat
ing about working on a film. The two

actors and eight crew members have
gathered together to realize the
dream of Kincaid Jones, a member of
Stanford's graduate film program.
Jones' particular vision is "The
Red Wagon," the movie she is
making to fulfill the requirements for
her master's thesis in film.
Of course, in making "The Red
Wagon" (a tentative title), Jones is
not motivated solely by the need to

obtain a degree. Like most
filmmakers, she has loftier aspira
tions. "I wanted to make a visual fan
tasy for general audiences, but a fan
tasy with some social relevance to it."
And indeed, Jones' film, which
should be about 30 minutes in length.

is relevant to today's society without
being in any way polemical. "The
Red Wagon" tells the story of Peter,
a young boy unable to accept his par
ents' divorce. The victim of a bitter
joint custody, Peter has lost interest
in his friends and school, and his self
esteem has all but disappeared. At his
grandparents' house for Christmas,
he discovers a magic red wooden
wagon.
To Peter's astonishment, the

wobbly little wagon follows him
wherever he goes. At first he rejects
the wagon, feeling himself too old
and too serious for such a child's toy.
But the wagon persists and eventually
wins the boy's heart, helping him to
recover his happiness and self-

esteem. Through the wagon, Peter is
able to bridge the divide between his
parents, and the entire family finds
new ways to deal with their difficult
situation.
"The big issue that I see facing kids
today is the deterioration of the fam
ily, and how they deal with it. Divorce
is epidemic in our society, and there
are ways of handling it and not hand
ling it. 1 wanted to present a positive
way of dealing with the problem,"

Jones said about her film. Another
reason for making 'The Red Wagon'
was Jones' facility with young actors:
"I like working with kids very much,"'
she says.
At 26, Jones knows a lot about
child actors and about acting in gen-

eral. As a child she studied at the
American Conservatory Theatre, and
she has been directing plays since she
was 12. This is hardly surprising, con
sidering that both her parents are
theater directors. Her other experi
ences include studying communica
tions as an undergraduate at the Uni
versity of Texas, attending a summer
long screenwriting seminar at the
BBC (England's government
sponsored TV network) in 1982 and

working in HBO's sales and market
ing department for three years.
Jones is very positive about Stan
ford's graduate film program, which
consists of six students and tour
teachers. "People don t take you
seriously when you say you're doing a
student film. One of the strengths of
Stanford's program is that we re
taught to approach people profes
sionally, to take things very
seriously."
At Stanford, Jones has worked un
der the tutelage of Julian Blaustein,
producer of "The Day the Earth
Stood Still" and "Khartoum," star
ring Charlton Heston. Blaustein has
used his expertise in cinematic
storytelling to serve as script adviser
for "The Red Wagon."
A fiction film, "The Red Wagon"
is something of an anomaly for Stan
ford's film program, which usually
only produces documentaries. The
opportunity to make the film came
when Theodore and Francis
Gabrielle contributed $15,000 to
Stanford's film department, with the
stipulation that it be used to make a
fiction film.
This will be Jones' first long-form
fiction film. She has made three films
for Stanford previously, among them
the documentary "Spare Time,"
about two elderly men who lawn
bowl, which was selected to open the
Palo Alto Film Festival this past
spring.

At Stanford, Jones has worked un
der the tutelage of Julian Blaustein,
producer of "The Day the Earth
Stood Still" and "Khartoum," star
ring Charlton Heston. Blaustein has
used his expertise in cinematic
storytelling to serve as script adviser
for "The Red Wagon."
A fiction film, "The Red Wagon"
is something of an anomaly for Stan
ford's film program, which usually
only produces documentaries. The
opportunity to make the film came
when Theodore and Francis
Gabrielle contributed $15,000 to
Stanford's film department, with the
stipulation that it be used to make a
fiction film.
This will be Jones' first long-form
fiction film. She has made three films
for Stanford previously, among them
the documentary "Spare Time,"
about two elderly men who lawn
bowl, which was selected to open the
Palo Alto Film Festival this past
spring.

I his is tlw first in a series of three
a nicies about the milking of a student
film here as pan of the university's
graduate film program. This segment
oj the article covers the background of
the production "The Red Wagon"
and its director, Kincaid Jones; fol
lowing installments will look at the
different jobs on a Jilm crew and the
problems of filming on location in
Menlo Park and San Francisco.
It's 2:30 on a chilly April morning,
and on Arlington Road in Menlo
Park a film shoot is winding down.
An 1 1-person crew has just finished
nearly nine hours of work. Ignoring
the bitter cold, they've overcome
problems in lighting, sound and
camera positioning. The actors have
tirelessly read through their lines
again and again, hoping for a perfect
take. All this effort is for a scene that
will probably last only two or three
minutes on film.
Despite the glittery trappings of the
film world, the actual business of
making a film is not a very glamorous
affair. This is especially true in the
case of student films, where there is
no Hollywood studio executive
throwing fabulous sums of cash
around the set. But while the making
of a student film can often be frustrat
ing and exhausting, there is also a
sense of excitement among the crew
members. In the back of everyone's

mind is one giddy thought: "We're
actually making a movie!"
Everyone present at the Menlo
Park film shoot is there because they
want to be, because they find some
thing uniquely satisfying and fascinat
ing about working on a film. The two

actors and eight crew members have
gathered together to realize the
dream of Kincaid Jones, a member of
Stanford's graduate film program.
Jones' particular vision is "The
Red Wagon," the movie she is
making to fulfill the requirements for
her master's thesis in film.
Of course, in making "The Red
Wagon" (a tentative title), Jones is
not motivated solely by the need to

obtain a degree. Like most
filmmakers, she has loftier aspira
tions. "I wanted to make a visual fan
tasy for general audiences, but a fan
tasy with some social relevance to it."
And indeed, Jones' film, which
should be about 30 minutes in length.

is relevant to today's society without
being in any way polemical. "The
Red Wagon" tells the story of Peter,
a young boy unable to accept his par
ents' divorce. The victim of a bitter
joint custody, Peter has lost interest
in his friends and school, and his self
esteem has all but disappeared. At his
grandparents' house for Christmas,
he discovers a magic red wooden
wagon.
To Peter's astonishment, the

wobbly little wagon follows him
wherever he goes. At first he rejects
the wagon, feeling himself too old
and too serious for such a child's toy.
But the wagon persists and eventually
wins the boy's heart, helping him to
recover his happiness and self-

esteem. Through the wagon, Peter is
able to bridge the divide between his
parents, and the entire family finds
new ways to deal with their difficult
situation.
"The big issue that I see facing kids
today is the deterioration of the fam
ily, and how they deal with it. Divorce
is epidemic in our society, and there
are ways of handling it and not hand
ling it. 1 wanted to present a positive
way of dealing with the problem,"

Jones said about her film. Another
reason for making 'The Red Wagon'
was Jones' facility with young actors:
"I like working with kids very much,"'
she says.
At 26, Jones knows a lot about
child actors and about acting in gen-

eral. As a child she studied at the
American Conservatory Theatre, and
she has been directing plays since she
was 12. This is hardly surprising, con
sidering that both her parents are
theater directors. Her other experi
ences include studying communica
tions as an undergraduate at the Uni
versity of Texas, attending a summer
long screenwriting seminar at the
BBC (England's government
sponsored TV network) in 1982 and

working in HBO's sales and market
ing department for three years.
Jones is very positive about Stan
ford's graduate film program, which
consists of six students and tour
teachers. "People don t take you
seriously when you say you're doing a
student film. One of the strengths of
Stanford's program is that we re
taught to approach people profes
sionally, to take things very
seriously."
