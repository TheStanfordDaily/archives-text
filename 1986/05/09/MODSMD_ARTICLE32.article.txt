## Cal looks to keep Card out of NCAAs 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Sports seasons around these parts
have a knack of ending in the same
old way: with a sentimental, not-so
big Big Game against cross-bay rival
California.
No matter what the sport, it's the
same old song and dance. A waltz,
maybe — something that's been
around for years anyway.
Forgive, but tradition can only go
so far. After all these yeans, there's a
sort of "We don't have anything bet
ter to do" attitude surrounding Cal-
Stanford events — especially if nei
ther team can look forward to post
season play.
But this year, at least for Stanford's
baseball team, is a little different.
The Cardinal finds itself in second
place in the Pacific 10 Conference's
Southern Division going into this
weekend's three-game series with
California, the Six-Pac's sixth-place
team. Stanford, 16-11 in league play,
stands two games behind UCLA. The
Bruins play three games with USC, in
fifth place in the conference, this
weekend.
The series opens this afternoon at
2:30 at Berkeley's Evans Field, then
comes to Stanford's Sunken Diamond
tommorrow for a 1 p.m. start. The
teams return to the East Bay for Sun
day's 1 p.m. wrapup game.
There's no mistaking it: This year's
renewal of the rivalry features a
whole lot more than tradition. There
is some real bigness to the Big Game.
Just listen to Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess, whose team is the two
time defending champ of the Six-Pac:
"We'll play this weekend like it's for
first place. Hey, this is it."
To have a chance, though, the
Cardinal needs some help from USC
against UCLA.
Will Stanford follow pennant-race
form and do some good old
scoreboard watching this weekend?
"We've got to concentrate on the job
at hand, and that's Cal," Marquess
said. "If we can't hold our own
against them, then (the UCLA series)
doesn't really matter."
Still, Marquess won't ignore the
happenings in Southern California. "I
hope USC plays as well agaiast them
(UCLA) as they did against us." The
Trojans swept three games from
Stanford two weeks ago in Los An
geles.
For the Cardinal, the series with
California couldn't come at a worse
time. Although California is solidly
established in the Six-Pac's cellar —
the team sports a 9-18 league mark
and is nine games behind UCLA —
the Bears are playing their best
baseball of the year, having won
seven of their last nine games.

Last weekend Cal swept three road
games from Oral Roberts, which
began that series as the sixth best
team in the country, according to one
poll. Moreover, the Bears boast a 22-
5 non-conference record.
"They're on a roll right now,"
Marquess said. "They kicked the
living stuffing out of Oral Roberts last
weekend and (Arizona State) the
week before." Cal took two of three
Six-Pac games from ASU in Tempq*
Ariz.
"They're playing well right now . . .
like everybody thought they would at
the beginning of the year," Marquess
added. "They had a bad stretch a
while back and that kind of put them
behind the eight ball."
Cal had dropped seven straight
league contests — including three to

Stanford four weeks ago — before
the ASU series.
"We all slumped at the same time,"
California Coach Bob Milano said.
"We all went into the tank together
. . . and that killed us.
"But that's behind us now, we're
playing much better baseball."
The team's batting average has
been on the rise with the recent hit
ting spree. Cal comes into the
weekend with a collective .300 bat
ting average, up some five points over
the last three weeks.
Jerry Goff, Cal's third baseman
and cleanup hitter, carries the team's
hottest stick. He leads Cal in hitting
with a .355 average and home runs
with 18. He's also second on the team
in RBls with 5 1.
First baseman Bill Maas, who bats

ahead of Goff in the No. 3 spot, has
hit 16 roundtrippers and driven in a
team-high 62 runs.
Left fielder Lance Blankenship
(.335-8-48), catcher Chris Knapp
(.333-6-37) and second baseman
Mike Baer (.3 19-6-26) round out the
Bears' attack.
Add to those big numbers a whole
lot of speed — Cal has swiped a
conference-high 188 bases this year
— and you've got one big headache
for Marquess' Cardinal.
"They're a lot like Arizona in that
they combine great power and
speed," Marquess said. "They'll pres
ent us with a lot of problems
defensively."
Marquess said he'll send Jack
McDowell, 9-4 on the year with a
flashy 2.50 ERA, to the mound

today. McDowell, whose last victory
came against these same Bears, will
go against Cal's Ted Eldredge, 4-2
with a 5.24 ERA.
Kevin Kunkel — whom Marquess
said "has been the best of our three
starters during the last four months"
— will take a 5-4 mark to the mound
tomorrow. Milano didn't name a
starter for the series' middle game.
Sunday's pitching matchup features
Stanford's Lee Plemel, 5-3, against
Mark Sampson, 4-5.
Card notes
KZSU radio, 90.1 FM, will offer a
live broadcast of all three games this
weekend. David Fisher will once
again engage Stanford's coach in a
post-game interview, the "Mark
Marquess Show."


After last weekend's series, Arizona and Stanford were going different
ways as Stanford took two out of three games to grab undisputed second

Kym Boyman/Daily file
place in the Six-Pac. Mark Davis will try to help the Cardinal hold that
spot in this weekend's three game set with California.
