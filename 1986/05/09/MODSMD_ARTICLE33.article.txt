# It will be a football Civil War
## 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
The Cardinal-White Game
will wrap up five weeks of
spring workouts for the Stan
ford football team tomorrow.
Kickoff time is scheduled for
10 a.m. at Stanford Stadium.
The game will have full con
tact and will be similar to a reg
ular season game. It will pit the
first-team offense against the
second-team defense, and the
second-team offense against
the first-team defense.
"It will be a regular game sit
uation," Stanford Defensive
Coordinator Dick Mannini
said. "We are trying to simulate
as close to game conditions as
possible."
The White team is made up
of the 1986 projected starters
and some backup players. The
Cardinal squad represents the
reserve players. Some players
will bring both red and white
jerseys to the contest.
As a culmination of spring
football, the Cardinal-White
Game is a good opportunity for
the coaches to see different
players in a game situation. It is
a chance to iron out offensive
and defensive sets.
"I think we will be looking
for execution more than any
thing else," Mannini said.
Going into the season's final
scrimmage, the defense in par
ticular has made vast improve
ments. It has been the most im
proved unit this spring, and an
aggressive style of play has
been its hallmark since day
one.
"It has been a very intense
five weeks," Mannini said. "It
has been a real physical spring.
They have gone at it from the
first whistle."
"The defense has been very
impressive," tailback Kevin
Scott said. "The young guys
have acted as catalysts. There is
a good attitude spreading over
the whole defense."
Senior linebacker Dave
Wyman has returned from a
knee injury which sidelined
him last year and has sparked
this aggressive brand of foot
ball.
"I can't say enough about what
Wyman has done," Mannini said.
"He has not dropped off a bit. His
presence alone has created an atmos
phere. It's an attitude that he brings
that has been missing."
The secondary will return starters
Toi Cook, Walt Harris and Brad
Humphreys. With the loss of Cook
and Harris to baseball this spring,

cornerbacks Alan Grant and Pat
Kelly have stepped right in.
"Alan Grant has been outstand
ing," Stanford head Coach Jack El
way said. "He is starting right now."
"We have got a good base at sec
ondary," Mannini said.
On the offensive end, the return of
senior quaterback John Paye, junior
tailback Brad Muster and junior wide
receivers Jeff James and Thomas
Henley should provide a strong foun
dation for next year.

Fullbacks Brian Morris, Marshall
Dillard and Scott Eschelman have /
also been impressive. Both the
ground and air attacks look strong for
the fall.
Elway and his coaching staff are
pleased with the spring efforts.
"I am really impressed with our
senior class," Elway said. "1 think
we'll be quicker and more consistent
on the defensive front. Overall, we
will have more team speed than last
year."
