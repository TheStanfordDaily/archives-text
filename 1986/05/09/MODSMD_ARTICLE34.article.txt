# Versatile star excels in field hockey and luge
## Bonnie Warner hurtles down icy chutes on her back at 75 miles per hour — for kicks 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
Quick! How many Stanford Olympians can you name?
Well the swimmers like Pablo Morales and John Moffet
are easy. Bob Mathias, the decathlon champ, is another
good one. Don't forget Bonnie Warner, either. Bonnie
Warner? Who is Bonnie Warner?
For those of you who have not heard of Bonnie Warner,
she is a field hockey star turned Olympic luger. Presently,
the communications major from Mount Baldy, is setting
her sights on the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.
Originally, when Warner arrived on the Farm in 1979,
she had no knowledge of luging at all. She was recruited as
a goalie for the women's field hockey team.
"1 came to Stanford because of its field hockey and its
academics," Warner said. "If I was solely interested in
hockey, I probably would have gone to a school on the
East Coast. 1 like Stanford and its communications pro
gram and the fact that Stanford has a competitive program
in hockey."

Oddly enough, it was by pure accident that Warner
became interested in luging. She participated as one of the
torch runners in the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid. N.Y.
While taking in the sights at the Games, she was intro
duced to luging.
"As one of the torch runners, I only had to be in the
opening and closing ceremonies," Warner said. "The rest
of the time, I had a free pass to all of the events. One day I
was watching the luge races. It looked like fun so I
decided to participate in a two-week camp after the
Olympics to discover new racers. I was stopped out that
quarter so the two weeks turned into a month."
The luge coaches must have liked what they saw. In a
short time, Warner became the top American woman in
the sport. In four years, she emerged from first-time rider
to Olympic team member. Warner explained how this
transformation was possible in so little time.
"In luging, it's kind of like you're a born luger. A coach
can tell if you've got a knack for it or not.
Warner obviously had the knack. In the 1984 Olympics
at Sarajevo, Warner finished 15th out of 30 competitors.
Had she not crashed on her third run she might have
finished as high as eighth.

Why would anyone with reasonable interest in her body
sit on a small sled, feet first, and hurl herself at nearly 75
miles per hour down an ice-covered wall banked at up to
80 degrees? Well, maybe it's fun.
"The only way to imagine luging is to drive down a
mountain road with high walls at 75 miles per hour, with
out brakes, while trying not to crash," Warner explained.
"But it's 100 times more fun and exciting than riding a
roller coaster."
With only one luge course in the United States, Warner
and her teammates must improvise to train. Warner
combines traditional conditioning and "road sledding."
"I run 'the dish,' lift weights and row to improve my
strength," Warner said. " Rowing is really great for im
proving my starts. We also use road sleds to train on dry
land. All they are are sleds with wheels on them. We take
them on local roads, like one cul-de-sac off of Sand Hill
Road in Menlo Park. They're a great simulation for the
real thing, except, of course, without the banking."
As for the future, Warner has several goals. But the
main one is winning an Olympic medal.
"I hope to get my degree this summer," she said. "Then
my immediate sights are on Calgary. The past winters, I
have been competing in the luge World Cup. Due to a
lack of funding, the team can only afford to compete in a
few races a year. Last year, I only raced in two but
managed to finish sixth in the standings. I feel I'm improv
ing all the time, and a medal is definitely within reach."
Whether or not Warner does bring home some Olympic
hardware, she plans to stay in sports, but from the other
side of the camera.
"If I were to win an Olympic medal, there would be
little left to prove in luging." she said. "I would consider
retirement. But if I finished fourth, a 100 th of a second
out, I probably would try again in 1992. Despite that, I am
going into television and film production. I want to con
centrate on sports. I probably would start off with some
one like ABC Sports since I've had some internships and
the like with them."'
Warner added that she feels she could bring a unique
perspective to television sports since she has actually
"been out there".
Warner currently resides on a ranch in Portola Valley.
She is working as a ranch hand, doing "typical jobs like
pulling weeds." She added that she enjoys just working
outside and the money that it brings in.
In what little spare time she has, Warner coaches
younger lugers and raises money for her team. She and
her club, the Western States Luge Club, conduct camps
during the year. Through her direct efforts, Warner has
managed to place two other Stanford students on the U.S.
developmental team. Her next camp will be May 22.
Anyone interested in the camp can write the WSLC for
information at PO Box 8563. Stanford.

"My immediate sights are
on Calgary ... a medal is
within reach."

Bonnie Warner's luge carcer has taken off faster . . . faster than a luger rocketing down the track. The Stan
ford student didn't start luging until after the 1980 Olympics, yet she placed 15th in the 1984 Winter Games.

out, I probably would try again in 1992. Despite that, I am
going into television and film production. I want to con
centrate on sports. I probably would start off with some
one like ABC Sports since I've had some internships and
the like with them."'
Warner added that she feels she could bring a unique
perspective to television sports since she has actually
"been out there".
Warner currently resides on a ranch in Portola Valley.
She is working as a ranch hand, doing "typical jobs like
pulling weeds." She added that she enjoys just working
outside and the money that it brings in.
In what little spare time she has, Warner coaches
younger lugers and raises money for her team. She and
her club, the Western States Luge Club, conduct camps
during the year. Through her direct efforts, Warner has
managed to place two other Stanford students on the U.S.
developmental team. Her next camp will be May 22.
Anyone interested in the camp can write the WSLC for
information at PO Box 8563. Stanford.

"My immediate sights are
on Calgary ... a medal is
within reach."
— Bonnie Warner


Bonnie Warner's luge carcer has taken off faster . . . faster than a luger rocketing down the track. The Stan
ford student didn't start luging until after the 1980 Olympics, yet she placed 15th in the 1984 Winter Games.
Quick! How many Stanford Olympians can you name?
Well the swimmers like Pablo Morales and John Moffet
are easy. Bob Mathias, the decathlon champ, is another
good one. Don't forget Bonnie Warner, either. Bonnie
Warner? Who is Bonnie Warner?
For those of you who have not heard of Bonnie Warner,
she is a field hockey star turned Olympic luger. Presently,
the communications major from Mount Baldy, is setting
her sights on the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.
Originally, when Warner arrived on the Farm in 1979,
she had no knowledge of luging at all. She was recruited as
a goalie for the women's field hockey team.
"1 came to Stanford because of its field hockey and its
academics," Warner said. "If I was solely interested in
hockey, I probably would have gone to a school on the
East Coast. 1 like Stanford and its communications pro
gram and the fact that Stanford has a competitive program
in hockey."

Oddly enough, it was by pure accident that Warner
became interested in luging. She participated as one of the
torch runners in the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid. N.Y.
While taking in the sights at the Games, she was intro
duced to luging.
"As one of the torch runners, I only had to be in the
opening and closing ceremonies," Warner said. "The rest
of the time, I had a free pass to all of the events. One day I
was watching the luge races. It looked like fun so I
decided to participate in a two-week camp after the
Olympics to discover new racers. I was stopped out that
quarter so the two weeks turned into a month."
The luge coaches must have liked what they saw. In a
short time, Warner became the top American woman in
the sport. In four years, she emerged from first-time rider
to Olympic team member. Warner explained how this
transformation was possible in so little time.
"In luging, it's kind of like you're a born luger. A coach
can tell if you've got a knack for it or not.
Warner obviously had the knack. In the 1984 Olympics
at Sarajevo, Warner finished 15th out of 30 competitors.
Had she not crashed on her third run she might have
finished as high as eighth.

Why would anyone with reasonable interest in her body
sit on a small sled, feet first, and hurl herself at nearly 75
miles per hour down an ice-covered wall banked at up to
80 degrees? Well, maybe it's fun.
"The only way to imagine luging is to drive down a
mountain road with high walls at 75 miles per hour, with
out brakes, while trying not to crash," Warner explained.
"But it's 100 times more fun and exciting than riding a
roller coaster."
With only one luge course in the United States, Warner
and her teammates must improvise to train. Warner
combines traditional conditioning and "road sledding."
"I run 'the dish,' lift weights and row to improve my
strength," Warner said. " Rowing is really great for im
proving my starts. We also use road sleds to train on dry
land. All they are are sleds with wheels on them. We take
them on local roads, like one cul-de-sac off of Sand Hill
Road in Menlo Park. They're a great simulation for the
real thing, except, of course, without the banking."
As for the future, Warner has several goals. But the
main one is winning an Olympic medal.
"I hope to get my degree this summer," she said. "Then
my immediate sights are on Calgary. The past winters, I
have been competing in the luge World Cup. Due to a
lack of funding, the team can only afford to compete in a
few races a year. Last year, I only raced in two but
managed to finish sixth in the standings. I feel I'm improv
ing all the time, and a medal is definitely within reach."
Whether or not Warner does bring home some Olympic
hardware, she plans to stay in sports, but from the other
side of the camera.
"If I were to win an Olympic medal, there would be
little left to prove in luging." she said. "I would consider
retirement. But if I finished fourth, a 100 th of a second
out, I probably would try again in 1992. Despite that, I am
going into television and film production. I want to con
