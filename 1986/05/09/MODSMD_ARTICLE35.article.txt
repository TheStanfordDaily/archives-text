# Stanford hits the water for big weekend
## Cardinal rowers in regatta 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff Writer 
Tough races are what separate the
men from the boys ... or the men
from the women, as the case may be.
The Pacific Coast Championships
is a tough event any way you look at
it. And the Stanford men's and
women's crews will be looking at it
from very different points of view.
The women, coming off a victory
last weekend against California and
fine finishes throughout the season,
are looking to maintain their record
going into their most important race
of the season. The men, on the other
hand, have been steadily improving
over the course of the season and
plan to make this their best racing
ever.
The last collegiate regatta for the
Cardinal crews will be held this
weekend near Sacramento on Lake
Natoma and features the finest
schools on the West Coast from San
Diego to Washington. There will be
1,400 participants in the regatta
which makes it the largest collegiate
regatta in the world.
The Cardinal varsity women go
into the heats tomorrow seeded
second behind Washington but with a
legitimate chance at taking the crown.
"Washington has to beat us to win,"
Stanford women's Coach John Davis
said. "We're feeling good about our
chances."
The squad's last three weeks of
workouts and meets have been aimed
essentially at this regatta. Tomor
row's heats should prove to be no
problem for Stanford. The Cardinal is
already looking forward to earning a
berth in the finals on Sunday and an
other shot against both Washington
and Cal. "On paper, we're well in

hand for the final," Davis said. "Then
we'll let all the juices flow on Sun
day."
Flowing juices alone may not be
enough to beat Cal for the second
straight time. "We don't expect it to
be easy to get second. We don't want
to overlook Cal, that would be
foolish," Davis said. "Cal is out to
gain revenge. The only way they can

salvage their season is to beat us."
The women will be giving it their
all this weekend, which is their last
chance to row due to the scheduling
of the nationals on the same day as
the Stanford Commencement. "This
is the one that goes on the record
books, but, regardless of how it goes,
we've proved ourselves to be of na
tional caliber," Davis said. "I have

nothing but praise for the athletes.
They've worked hard all year. We're
just going to put some strokes in the
water and see how it goes."
The three other women's boats
face an uphill climb. The JV boat will
be racing with a new lineup as Tina
Simpson is out with a stress-fractured
rib. The JVs are seeded third behind
Washington and Cal. The frosh boat,

coming off a tough loss to Cal last
weekend, will face an equally tough
qualifying heat tomorrow to make it
to the finals. "We're confident they
can still win it," Davis said.

season," Stanford men's Coach Ken Dreyfuss said.
