# Sailors aiming at nationals
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
This could be it for the sailing
season, or it could be just the start. ..
the start of more weeks of intense
practice. The Stanford sailing team
has never looked forward to practice
like this before.
The squad will take its show on the
road this weekend to compete in the
climactic event of its season, the na
tional qualifiers. Facing five schools
from Northern California and five
from Southern California with
Hawaii thrown in, the Cardinal will
attempt to qualify its co-ed team, as it
did its women's team, on the calm
waters near Irvine.
The Cardinal has come to be a
name that strikes fear in the hearts of
other intercollegiate sailing schools.
The specialized training and unique
strategy of the Stanford team has
worked to make it one of the teams to
beat. "We're going down with every
thing we've got," Stanford Coach Joe
Petrucci said. "We are as well trained
as we feel we can be."
But victory won't be quite that
easy. Dominating Northern Califor
nia schools means nothing compared
to the likes of UC-Irvine and USC,
the teams to beat, or Orange Coast
College who will be racing on its
home course. "It'll be a real dog
fight," Petrucci said. "A knock
down, drag out, all-or-nothing
thing."
The light wind expected in Irvine
should be to the advantage of the
Cardinal, which plans on using a
female skipper, Rona Sisson, in one
boat. "I won't hesitate to use her light
wind," Petrucci said. "I'll throw in
what no one is expecting."
Sailing with Sisson will be Suzy
Pritchett. Drew Gashler and Irma
Rodriguez will round out the varsity
lineup. The team will also be taking
along skippers Dan Buckstaff, Rich
Bergsend and Bill Shoemaker and
crewmembers Kristin Boyles and
M-'nV"

The Cardinal strategy will involve
using everyone, making weight com
binations according to the wind.
Sailing well tomorrow will be impor
tant, but the final races on Sunday are
what should prove to make the differ
ence. "We need to sail very well to
qualify. Whatever team is hot on Sun
day will qualify," Petrucci said. "It's
too hard to get way ahead the first
day and slump. We're a second-day
team, which is nice."

The top two teams of the weekend
will qualify for nationals, as will the
top two squads in the team racing
competition to be held on Monday.
Stanford will be looking to qualify in
both events to make up for last year
when it failed to qualify in the team
event.
"The is the biggest event of the
year. Either the season is over ... or
we go on," Petrucci said. "It'll be a
real team effort."
