# Track gearing up for future meets
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
It will be a low-pressure weekend
for the Stanford track team. With the
women's Pacific West Conference
Championships next weekend and
the men's Pacific 10 Conference
Championships the following week,
tomorrow's Modesto Invitational will
be what Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson calls a "filler."
"That's what these late-season in
vitationals are really for," Johnson
said. "If you need to rest some kids,
you rest them. If you need to race
some kids you race them."
Among those who need a race will
be Jeff Atkinson, Glenn Schneider
and John Gash. Johnson said he is
hoping that all three will be able to
qualify for the NCAAs. Atkinson, a
seventh-place finisher in last year's
NCAA 1,500-meters and the school
record holder at that distance, will
enter the 1,500 in hopes of qualify
ing.
Schneider, a freshman, will enter
the discus, while Gash, a sophomore,
will compete in the pole vault. It will
take a major improvement for Gash
to reach the NCAA qualifying height
of 17-4'/i, but after a couple of weeks

of promising practice vaults, Johnson
thinks that he may be ready.
"He's been getting the height, he
just needs to get over the bar,"
Johnson said of Gash, who has yet to
pass the 16-6 barrier this season.
For the women, Ceci Hopp, a
former NCAA champion at 3,000
meters and a fifth-year senior, still
needs to qualify for the NCAAs, but
Johnson decided that it would better
for Hopp to train through the
weekend and come back strong for
the Pac-Wests. Johnson said he
foresees little problem in Hopp's
qualifying at the conference cham
pionships.
Looking ahead, Johnson feels that
the team is "in a position to do well"
at this years conference champion
ships and is "only a year or two
away" from being in a position to win
them.
He pointed to the fact that the
Cardinal mens team is redshirting six
key athletes and is expecting a
recruiting class which may very well
be the best in Johnson's seven-year
stay at Stanford.
With those recruits and the return
of the redshirts, the team "will be
able to make a quantum leap in two
years," Johnson said.
