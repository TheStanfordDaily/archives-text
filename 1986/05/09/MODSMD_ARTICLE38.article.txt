# Giants fall to Pirates

### 
PITTSBURGH (AP) â€” Mike
Bielecki allowed four hits over seven
innings and Sid Bream drove in three
runs with a double and a single as the
Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the San
Francisco Giants 8-2 last night.
Bielecki, 3-0, lost his shutout bid
and a 15-inning scoreless streak when
Joel Youngblood hit a pinch-hit
home run leading off the eighth. He
struck out four and walked four and
held the Giants hitless for six innings
until yielding solo homers in the
eighth to Youngblood and Will Clark.
Jim Winn relieved Bielecki and
finished with two hitless innings,
completing the combined four-hitter.
Scott Garrelts, the Giants' hard
luck pitcher this year and All-Star
representative last season, took the
loss and fell to 3-3. Garrelts recently
received a no decision against the
Cubs after San Francisco reliever
Greg Minton blew a two-run lead.
