Full professors here earn more money
than faculty at any national university ex
cept Harvard, according to information
compiled by the American Association of
University Professors.
Stanford also boasts higher salaries for
associate and assistant professors than any
doctoral-level institution except Cal Tech.
Full professors at Stanford earn an
average salary of $63,100 "because we
want the best faculty we can have," Uni

versity Provost James Rosse said yester
day.
"We should be first across the board,"
Rosse said, adding that Harvard's position
is a result of the university being "very
well-endowed."
"We have a much better balance," he
said, in reference to the average salaries of
associate and assistant professors at Stan

respectively.
Rosse acknowledged that these lower
salaries are a "trade off' for an opportu

academically.
A high cost of living also plays a part in
increasing Stanford salaries, he said.
