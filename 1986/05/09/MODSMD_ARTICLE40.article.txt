Shultz in Manila amidst controversy
MANILA, Philippines — Secretary of State George Shultz landed
here yesterday in the middle of a heated controversy touched off by one
of his own statements about whether the new Philippines government of
President Corazon Aquino should give a passport to ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos, now living in exile in Hawaii.
Shultz, who flew here after stops in Japan and South Korea, said he
had come to discuss how the Reagan Administration can help Aquino
achieve economic recoveiy — without further increases in U.S. aid to
the Philippines.
But the most heated issue facing him during his 26-hour visit was nei
ther the Philippines' $26 billion national debt nor the fighting in the
countryside as the armed forces struggle to quell an escalating Commu
nist insurgency. As far as the Philippines is concerned, the major issue is
the exile status of Marcos, who has pledged that he will return here.
Shultz and President Reagan both have been pressing the Aquino
government either to give Marcos travel documents that would let him
leave his Hawaiian exile or return his passport, which Aquino specifi
cally revoked after Marcos fled the Philippines on Feb. 25.
Aquino has said that that Marcos may not return to the Philippines
because of the destabilizing effect his presence here would tend to have.
She has also urged the United States to keep him pinned down in
Hawaii, where Philippine government lawyers can investigate him and
pursue litigation against him to try to recover $5 billion to $10 billion
that the Aquino government believes he stole from the treasury during
his nearly two decades in power.
Last week in Indonesia, Reagan and Shultz both told Salvador Laurel,
Aquino's vice president and foreign minister, that Marcos is becoming a
political nuisance and an embarrassment to the United States, Laurel
told reporters here, and they urged Aquino furnish the documents that
would allow Marcos to leave the United States.
The issue was debated for more than an hour Wednesday by Aquino's
Cabinet, which is divided on the issue.
Information Minister Teodoro Locsin. one of Aquino's closest ad
visers, told reporters afterward, "We want Marcos to stay in the United
States. We want Marcos to be sued in the United States. We want
Marcos to die in the United States."
Other Cabinet members took a softer line. Laurel himself is known to
favor permitting Marcos to travel to a third country of exile, possibly by
granting him a travel document valid only for that country.
Hasina wants new Bangladesh vote
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Bangladesh's opposition leader, Sheik
Hasina Wazed, demanded yesterday new elections in many areas of the
country in the wake of national parliamentary balloting that was plagued
by fraud and violence.
Hasina, president of the Awami League, a political party that finished
second in the disputed election to a new government-backed party,
asked for new voting in "at least 50" of the 300 parliamentary con
stituencies.
But she also reduced chances of a harsh confrontation with the
martial-law regime of President Hussain Mohammed Ershad by an
nouncing that she and other winning candidates from her party would
take their seats in Parliament despite the allegations of fraud.
Hasina, 38, daughter of Bangladesh's founder, Sheik Mujibur Rah
man, said that "through Parliament we plan to continue our movement."
Nearly complete returns showed Awami winning 80 seats compared
to more than 140 for the government-backed Jatiya Party, which was
created by Ershad as one of his moves to return the nation to civilian
rule. Ershad, army chief of staff, took power in a 1982 coup d'etat.
Earlier, diplomats had wondered if Hasani would be satisfied enough
with 80 seats to participate in Parliament, a question that seemed to be
answered by her statement yesterday.
Meanwhile, more reports of violence and election abuses reached the
capital. Hasina complained about election boxes being dumped into
rivers and of ballots being burned in several cities.
Costa Rican leader sworn in
SAN JOSE. Costa Rica — As nine other Latin American leaders
watched, Oscar Arias Sanchez was sworn in yesterday as president of
Costa Rica. He vowed to keep the countiy out of armed conflict in
Central America.
Arias, 45, of the ruling National Liberation Party, called for a
negotiated solution to conflicts in neighboring Nicaragua and nearby EI
Salvador, and urged that a proposed regional peace treaty be signed by
June 6.
The turnout of Central and South American presidents was seen as a
push for the peace effort undertaken by the Contadora Group, four
Latin nations that have been seeking peace in Central America through
mediation for more than three years.
"We will keep Costa Rica out of the armed conflicts of Central
America and we will endeavor, through diplomatic and political means,
to prevent Central American brothers from killing each other," Arias
said in his inaugural speech.
At a meeting in Panama last month, four of the five Central American
nations agreed to sign a pledge to tiy to wind up negotiations on the still
unfinished draft peace accord and be ready to sign it June 6. But the fifth
nation, Nicaragua, refused, holding to its longstanding position that it
cannot sign a peace treaty until the United States quits backing rebel
guerrillas trying to bring down the government of Nicaragua. The
United States, which says it backs the Contadora process but is not a for
mal part of it, refuses to negotiate bilaterally with the Marxist-led Sandi
nista government.
Syria denies link to terrorists
LONDON — Syria has turned down a British request that it waive
diplomatic immunity to allow its diplomats to be questioned in connec
tion with last month's attempted bombing of an Israeli airliner at Lon
don's Heathrow airport, sources here said.
But in public statements yesterday, Damascus moved to squash
speculation that it was involved in that incident or a recent terrorist
bombing in West Berlin, and offered to cooperate with police investiga
tions in both cities.
Calling such reports "an orchestrated smear campaign intended to
justify Israeli and American military action against us." a statement
issued by the Syrian Embassy here said that Syria "categorically denies
any knowledge of. or involvement in alleged terrorist activities on
British soil, and in particular the incident at Heathrow airport on April
17, 1986."
A British Foreign Office official said, "we are still considering"
today's statement, and that the government here would make no com
ment on it.
The statement came as sources said Damascus had refused a British
request that diplomatic immunity be waived to allow several Syrian
diplomats to be questioned about the Heathrow incident. They said the
refusal was given by Syrian Ambassador Loutof Haydar in a meeting
with Foreign Office officials on Monday.
The sources said that Britain had asked for the interviews as part of
the investigation of Nezar Hindawi, a Jordanian national who has been
charged with the unsuccessful attempt to place a bomb aboard the Tel
Aviv-bound Israeli plane. Police say Hindawi gave his unsuspecting
girlfriend a suitcase with a concealed bomb before she was to board the
flight. The bomb was discovered by Israeli security guards working for
El A 1 airline.

today's statement, and that the government here would make no com
ment on it.
The statement came as sources said Damascus had refused a British
request that diplomatic immunity be waived to allow several Syrian
diplomats to be questioned about the Heathrow incident. They said the
refusal was given by Syrian Ambassador Loutof Haydar in a meeting
with Foreign Office officials on Monday.
The sources said that Britain had asked for the interviews as part of
the investigation of Nezar Hindawi, a Jordanian national who has been
charged with the unsuccessful attempt to place a bomb aboard the Tel
Aviv-bound Israeli plane. Police say Hindawi gave his unsuspecting
girlfriend a suitcase with a concealed bomb before she was to board the
flight. The bomb was discovered by Israeli security guards working for
El A 1 airline.
Shultz in Manila amidst controversy
MANILA, Philippines — Secretary of State George Shultz landed
here yesterday in the middle of a heated controversy touched off by one
of his own statements about whether the new Philippines government of
President Corazon Aquino should give a passport to ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos, now living in exile in Hawaii.
Shultz, who flew here after stops in Japan and South Korea, said he
had come to discuss how the Reagan Administration can help Aquino
achieve economic recoveiy — without further increases in U.S. aid to
the Philippines.
But the most heated issue facing him during his 26-hour visit was nei
ther the Philippines' $26 billion national debt nor the fighting in the
countryside as the armed forces struggle to quell an escalating Commu
nist insurgency. As far as the Philippines is concerned, the major issue is
the exile status of Marcos, who has pledged that he will return here.
Shultz and President Reagan both have been pressing the Aquino
government either to give Marcos travel documents that would let him
leave his Hawaiian exile or return his passport, which Aquino specifi
cally revoked after Marcos fled the Philippines on Feb. 25.
Aquino has said that that Marcos may not return to the Philippines
because of the destabilizing effect his presence here would tend to have.
She has also urged the United States to keep him pinned down in
Hawaii, where Philippine government lawyers can investigate him and
pursue litigation against him to try to recover $5 billion to $10 billion
that the Aquino government believes he stole from the treasury during
his nearly two decades in power.
Last week in Indonesia, Reagan and Shultz both told Salvador Laurel,
Aquino's vice president and foreign minister, that Marcos is becoming a
political nuisance and an embarrassment to the United States, Laurel
told reporters here, and they urged Aquino furnish the documents that
would allow Marcos to leave the United States.
The issue was debated for more than an hour Wednesday by Aquino's
Cabinet, which is divided on the issue.
Information Minister Teodoro Locsin. one of Aquino's closest ad
visers, told reporters afterward, "We want Marcos to stay in the United
States. We want Marcos to be sued in the United States. We want
Marcos to die in the United States."
Other Cabinet members took a softer line. Laurel himself is known to
favor permitting Marcos to travel to a third country of exile, possibly by
granting him a travel document valid only for that country.
Hasina wants new Bangladesh vote
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Bangladesh's opposition leader, Sheik
Hasina Wazed, demanded yesterday new elections in many areas of the
country in the wake of national parliamentary balloting that was plagued
by fraud and violence.
Hasina, president of the Awami League, a political party that finished
second in the disputed election to a new government-backed party,
asked for new voting in "at least 50" of the 300 parliamentary con
stituencies.
But she also reduced chances of a harsh confrontation with the
martial-law regime of President Hussain Mohammed Ershad by an
nouncing that she and other winning candidates from her party would
take their seats in Parliament despite the allegations of fraud.
Hasina, 38, daughter of Bangladesh's founder, Sheik Mujibur Rah
man, said that "through Parliament we plan to continue our movement."
Nearly complete returns showed Awami winning 80 seats compared
to more than 140 for the government-backed Jatiya Party, which was
created by Ershad as one of his moves to return the nation to civilian
rule. Ershad, army chief of staff, took power in a 1982 coup d'etat.
Earlier, diplomats had wondered if Hasani would be satisfied enough
with 80 seats to participate in Parliament, a question that seemed to be
answered by her statement yesterday.
Meanwhile, more reports of violence and election abuses reached the
capital. Hasina complained about election boxes being dumped into
rivers and of ballots being burned in several cities.
Costa Rican leader sworn in
SAN JOSE. Costa Rica — As nine other Latin American leaders
watched, Oscar Arias Sanchez was sworn in yesterday as president of
Costa Rica. He vowed to keep the countiy out of armed conflict in
Central America.
Arias, 45, of the ruling National Liberation Party, called for a
negotiated solution to conflicts in neighboring Nicaragua and nearby EI
Salvador, and urged that a proposed regional peace treaty be signed by
June 6.
The turnout of Central and South American presidents was seen as a
push for the peace effort undertaken by the Contadora Group, four
Latin nations that have been seeking peace in Central America through
mediation for more than three years.
"We will keep Costa Rica out of the armed conflicts of Central
America and we will endeavor, through diplomatic and political means,
to prevent Central American brothers from killing each other," Arias
said in his inaugural speech.
At a meeting in Panama last month, four of the five Central American
nations agreed to sign a pledge to tiy to wind up negotiations on the still
unfinished draft peace accord and be ready to sign it June 6. But the fifth
nation, Nicaragua, refused, holding to its longstanding position that it
cannot sign a peace treaty until the United States quits backing rebel
guerrillas trying to bring down the government of Nicaragua. The
United States, which says it backs the Contadora process but is not a for
mal part of it, refuses to negotiate bilaterally with the Marxist-led Sandi
nista government.
Syria denies link to terrorists
LONDON — Syria has turned down a British request that it waive
diplomatic immunity to allow its diplomats to be questioned in connec
tion with last month's attempted bombing of an Israeli airliner at Lon
don's Heathrow airport, sources here said.
But in public statements yesterday, Damascus moved to squash
speculation that it was involved in that incident or a recent terrorist
bombing in West Berlin, and offered to cooperate with police investiga
tions in both cities.
Calling such reports "an orchestrated smear campaign intended to
justify Israeli and American military action against us." a statement
issued by the Syrian Embassy here said that Syria "categorically denies
any knowledge of. or involvement in alleged terrorist activities on
British soil, and in particular the incident at Heathrow airport on April
17, 1986."
A British Foreign Office official said, "we are still considering"
today's statement, and that the government here would make no com
