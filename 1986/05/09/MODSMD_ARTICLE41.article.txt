# 84,000 evacuated from danger zone
## Reactor may be melting into earth

MOSCOW — Workers dug below the smolder
ing Chernobyl reactor yesterday in what a leading
Soviet scientist termed a battle against an unprece
dented nuclear accident.
Remarks by Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of
the Academy of Sciences and a personal adviser to
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, indicated that
the reactor core may be melting downwards.
His words seemed to support theories by experts
in the West who said that the Soviets may be facing
the so-called China Syndrome: a meltdown that
sinks through the earth's outer crust.
In other developments, officials said that 84,000
persons, rather than 49,000 as previously reported,
had been evacuated in two stages from a "danger
zor»*" >mnnd the stricken reactor.

Hundreds of persons left Kiev, where the out
door sale of ice cream was banned and officials
considered whether to close schools early because
ot Chernobyl emissions that raised radiation levels
in the Ukrainian capital, 60 miles south of the reac
tor site.
Hans Blix, director-general of the International
Atomic Energy Agency, said that he saw "a little
smoke" emerging from the reactor as he and two
aides flew over the site in a helicopter.
Specialists were working hard to contain the
emissions, he said, adding: "1 hope they will con
tinue to stabilize the situation." He has scheduled a
news conference in Moscow today to discuss his
visit here.

Velikhov, in an interview published in Pravda,
the Communist Party daily, gave the most pessimis
tic appraisal by any Soviet official since the Cher
nobyl disaster occurred April 26.
"As for the reactor, we have mounted an offen
sive against it,"he added. "The work proceeds not
only above, but beneath it as well. Our task is to
neutralize it completely, to 'bury it, as we say. .. .
"No one has ever encountered this sort of an
accident, and the unusual nature of the situation
demands solutions that specialists never had to deal
with," he added.
Velikhov, 50, a specialist in nuclear and plasma
physics, is a member of the government commis
sion formed to deal with and lind the causes of the
Chernobyl tragedy.
