# Budget panel approves spending plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House
Budget Committee, brushing aside
Democratic leaders' qualms about
raising taxes without Republican sup
port, yesterday approved a budget for
next year that exceeds Gramm-
Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction
targets by increasing revenues, cut
ting defense and freezing most
domestic programs.
In contrast to the bipartisan budget
approved by the Republican
controlled Senate last week, the
Democratic-drafted House plan was
voted out of committee on a basically
party-line vote of 21-11 after
Republicans refused to go along with
the tax increases and the size of the
defense spending cut.
Republicans complained they had
been dealt out from the start and in
formed only late Wednesday of the

Democrats' plan. "You cannot call
the night before . . . and call it
negotiations," said Rep. Lynn Martin
(R-Ill.)
Despite objections raised earlier by
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) and other
Democratic leaders to tax increases
unless they had bipartisan support, a
leadership aide said the committee's
action had the "acquiescence" of
party leaders.
Committee Chairman William
Gray (D-Penn.) said he expected the
plan will have the support of O'Neill
and other party leaders when it comes
to the House floor, possibly next
week. But he added that taxes in
excess of those recommended by
President Reagan could be dropped
unless House Republicans support
them.

House Majority Whip Thomas
Foley (D-Wash.) also said Demo
cratic leadership support for the taxes
remains conditional on GOP support.
The $994.3 billion budget — just
under the Senate's $1 trillion plan —
would reduce deficits by about $38
billion to $137 billion. This is $7 bil
lion less than the $144 billion deficit
target set by Gramm-Rudman-
Hollings and the deficit number ap
proved by the Senate.
It includes the Senate's plan to
raise taxes and other revenues by
$13.2 billion, about $7 billion more
than Reagan proposed in his budget
for next year. The excess over
Reagan's request would go toward
reducing the deficit below the $144
billion target, with half held in a spe
cial reserve that would be put off

limits forspending purposes.
The budget proposal would cut
Reagan's $320 billion defense spend
ing authority request to $285 billion,
or $16 billion less than the Senate
proposed and $2 billion under cur
rent levels.
It would generally freeze domestic
spending at current levels, basically in
line with what the Senate proposed,
although new funding is provided for
some health, education and training
efforts for low-income people.
Like the Senate plan, it would set
cost-of-living increases for Social Se
curity and other government pensions
at 2 percent unless inflation is higher.
The House plan would provide
federal pay increases of 3 percent; the
Senate would increase pay by 2 per
cent.
