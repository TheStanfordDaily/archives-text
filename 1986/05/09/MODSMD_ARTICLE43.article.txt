Panel rejects nominee
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary
Committee refused to approve one of President
Reagan's judicial nominees for the first time yes
terday, then agreed in a second vote to send the
nomination of Daniel Manion to the floor with
out a recommendation.
After hearing impassioned arguments that the
Indiana lawyer is too inexperienced and his views
too extreme, the panel rejected his nomination to
a federal appeals court on a 9-to-9 tie.
Key negative votes were cast by Republicans
Arlen Specter (Pa), Charles Mathias (Md) and
Democrat Dennis DeConcini (Ariz).
A moment later, however, Specter and
DeConcini switched their votes on a motion to
have the full Senate consider the nomination
without committee approval.
Democrats said the battle over Manion is a test
of the Senate's will to block Reagan judicial
nominees who Democrats contend are mar
ginally qualified. "This is one we'll go to the wall
on," ranking committee Democrat Joseph Biden
(Del) said.
Manion, 44, a former state senator, is the son
of the late Clarence Manion, a John Birch Soci
ety leader and former dean of Notre Dame Law
School.
The nominee frequently appeared with his
father on a syndicated broadcast called "The
Manion Forum" in the 19705, making controver
sial statements that his critics have cited at
length.
Democrats said they fear that Manion would
follow his conservative ideology, not court prece
dents, if confirmed for the 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago.
Drilling disputes settled
WASHINGTON — Oil industry and environ
mental groups yesterday urged Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel to ratify an unprecedented agree

ment they reached on drilling off the Alaskan
coast, but the disputes between the Longtime ad
versaries were relatively easy to resolve.
The two sides, brought together by actor
Robert Redford, said at a press conference that
each got virtually all it wanted in talks marked by
a dramatic improvement in understanding each
other's views.
However, the parties dropped negotiations on
the toughest area in dispute: the salmon-rich
Bristol Bay, where the Interior Department wants
to offer leases on 5.6 million acres of potentially
oil-rich ocean floor.
The coalition of industry and environmental
groups, which included representatives of native
Alaskans and fishermen, recommended that 48
million acres in four areas of the Bering Sea be
included in a five-year leasing plan that the de
partment must draft by the fall to replace the cur
rent one, which expires this year.
At the same time, the coalition urged that 240
million environmentally sensitive acres be placed
off limits to drilling. In addition, they recom
mended that a group similar to theirs be called
upon to resolve any contlicts over proposed
leasing of specific tracts.
Redford, who organized the eight months of
negotiations through his Institute for Resource
Management, said Hodel gave a positive
response at a meeting with 20 coalition members.
In a statement. Hodel commended the group's
innovative efforts but said it would "not be ap
propriate to react" to their proposal until all
views had been considered, including that of the
state of Alaska.
NASA to use help
WASHINGTON — Concerned about the pace
and direction of redesign work on the space
shuttle's flawed solid rocket booster, the presi
dential commission investigating the Jan. 28
Challenger disaster has pursuaded the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to use a

team of outside experts to oversee the work of its
own engineers.
Commission sources, declining to be identified,
said several members of the panel were con
cerned that the redesign process was moving too
rapidly toward a firm conclusion. Moreover,
some commissioners were said to have strong
reservations because the redesign assignment was
in the hands of engineers at NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center.
Rocket engineers at Marshall were responsible
for the existing booster design and have also been
at the center of the controversy over the decision
to launch the ill-fated Challenger despite un
usually cold weather and reservations expressed
by contractors.
NASA officials leading the redesign work ap
peared before the commission in a closed session
last Friday, and sources said panel members were
surprised when they heard how definitive
redesign plans had already become. A transcript
of the closed session is expected to be released
today or tomorrow.
Because of their concern about the redesign
work, the commission sources said, members
asked acting NASA Administrator William
Graham and shuttle program chief Richard Truly
to arrange for independent oversight, and the
N AS A officials agreed. A panel is expected to be
named by the National Academy of Engineering
and the National Research Council.
Prices close higher
NEW YORK — The stock market put to
gether a moderate rally yesterday as traders took
a slightly more sanguine view of the outlook for
interest rates.
Retail and energy stocks ranked among the
leaders of the advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen more than 18 points in the two
previous sessions, gained 10.91 to 1,786.21.

Redford, who organized the eight months of
negotiations through his Institute for Resource
Management, said Hodel gave a positive
response at a meeting with 20 coalition members.
In a statement. Hodel commended the group's
innovative efforts but said it would "not be ap

NASA to use help
WASHINGTON — Concerned about the pace
and direction of redesign work on the space
shuttle's flawed solid rocket booster, the presi
dential commission investigating the Jan. 28
Challenger disaster has pursuaded the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to use a

team of outside experts to oversee the work of its
own engineers.
Commission sources, declining to be identified,
said several members of the panel were con
cerned that the redesign process was moving too
rapidly toward a firm conclusion. Moreover,
some commissioners were said to have strong
reservations because the redesign assignment was
in the hands of engineers at NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center.
Rocket engineers at Marshall were responsible
for the existing booster design and have also been
at the center of the controversy over the decision
to launch the ill-fated Challenger despite un
usually cold weather and reservations expressed
by contractors.
NASA officials leading the redesign work ap
peared before the commission in a closed session
last Friday, and sources said panel members were
surprised when they heard how definitive
redesign plans had already become. A transcript
of the closed session is expected to be released
today or tomorrow.
Because of their concern about the redesign
work, the commission sources said, members
asked acting NASA Administrator William
Graham and shuttle program chief Richard Truly
to arrange for independent oversight, and the
N AS A officials agreed. A panel is expected to be
named by the National Academy of Engineering
and the National Research Council.
Prices close higher
NEW YORK — The stock market put to
gether a moderate rally yesterday as traders took

interest rates.
Retail and energy stocks ranked among the
leaders of the advance.

which had fallen more than 18 points in the two
previous sessions, gained 10.91 to 1,786.21.
Panel rejects nominee
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary
Committee refused to approve one of President
Reagan's judicial nominees for the first time yes
terday, then agreed in a second vote to send the
nomination of Daniel Manion to the floor with
out a recommendation.
After hearing impassioned arguments that the
Indiana lawyer is too inexperienced and his views
too extreme, the panel rejected his nomination to
a federal appeals court on a 9-to-9 tie.
Key negative votes were cast by Republicans
Arlen Specter (Pa), Charles Mathias (Md) and
Democrat Dennis DeConcini (Ariz).
A moment later, however, Specter and
DeConcini switched their votes on a motion to
have the full Senate consider the nomination
without committee approval.
Democrats said the battle over Manion is a test
of the Senate's will to block Reagan judicial
nominees who Democrats contend are mar
ginally qualified. "This is one we'll go to the wall
on," ranking committee Democrat Joseph Biden
(Del) said.
Manion, 44, a former state senator, is the son
of the late Clarence Manion, a John Birch Soci
ety leader and former dean of Notre Dame Law
School.
The nominee frequently appeared with his
father on a syndicated broadcast called "The
Manion Forum" in the 19705, making controver
sial statements that his critics have cited at
length.
Democrats said they fear that Manion would
follow his conservative ideology, not court prece
dents, if confirmed for the 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago.
Drilling disputes settled
WASHINGTON — Oil industry and environ
mental groups yesterday urged Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel to ratify an unprecedented agree

ment they reached on drilling off the Alaskan
coast, but the disputes between the Longtime ad
versaries were relatively easy to resolve.
The two sides, brought together by actor
Robert Redford, said at a press conference that
each got virtually all it wanted in talks marked by
a dramatic improvement in understanding each
other's views.
However, the parties dropped negotiations on
the toughest area in dispute: the salmon-rich
Bristol Bay, where the Interior Department wants
to offer leases on 5.6 million acres of potentially
oil-rich ocean floor.
The coalition of industry and environmental
groups, which included representatives of native
Alaskans and fishermen, recommended that 48
million acres in four areas of the Bering Sea be
included in a five-year leasing plan that the de
partment must draft by the fall to replace the cur
rent one, which expires this year.
At the same time, the coalition urged that 240
million environmentally sensitive acres be placed
off limits to drilling. In addition, they recom
mended that a group similar to theirs be called
upon to resolve any contlicts over proposed
leasing of specific tracts.
Redford, who organized the eight months of
negotiations through his Institute for Resource
Management, said Hodel gave a positive
response at a meeting with 20 coalition members.

innovative efforts but said it would "not be ap
propriate to react" to their proposal until all
