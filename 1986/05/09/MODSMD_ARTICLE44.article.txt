Ramirez 'loves to kill'
LOS ANGELES — The drifter accused of the
"Night Stalker" serial murders bragged that he
loves to kill and said he gouged out a woman's
eyes when she refused to give him money, ac
cording to testimony unsealed yesterday.
"I love to kill people. I love watching them
die," sheriffs Deputy Jim Ellis quoted Richard
Ramirez as saying.
"I would shoot them in the head and they
would wiggle and squirm all over the place and
then just stop: or cut them with a knife and watch
their face turn real white. I love all that blood."
Ramirez, who faces trial on 14 murder counts
in Los Angeles County, also bragged that he was
an uncatchable "supercriminal" who had killed
20 people in California, according to Ellis, who
was assigned to guard him in jail.
"One time 1 told this lady to give me all her
money. She said no. So I cut her and pulled her
eyes out, Ramirez was quoted as telling Ellis on
Oct. 10.
"Night Stalker victim Maxine Zazzara, 44,
slain with her husband March 29. 1985, in their

Whittier home, had her eyes cut out, sheriffs
Deputy Russell Uloth testified at Ramirez's pre
liminary hearing in March.
It was the second straight day of sensational
revelations in the case. On Wednesday, secret
transcripts were released quoting Ramirez as
saying "Of course i did it"and linking Satan to
the string of slayings, rapes and beatings.
His attorneys, Daniel and Arturo Hernandez,
who are not related, maintain he never made the
statements.
Walker criticizes defense
SAN FRANCISCO — Spymaster John
Walker, winding up seven days as the key prose
cution witness at the Jerry Whitworth espionage
trial, said yesterday that Whitworth must have
known he was spying for the Soviet Union even
though Walker never told him.
Stating his opinion over strenuous objections
by defense lawyer James Larson, Walker said
"common sense" would have led Whitworth to
conclude that the Soviets were the buyers of the

sophisticated Navy code secrets he was provid
ing.
"It would make no sense that a friendly gov
ernment or a criminal element would buy cryp
tographic material," Walker said, referring to the
explanations he claimed he gave in response to
Whitworth's repeated inquiries about the identity
of the buyers.
Walker said only the United States and the So
viet Union had the expertise to use code
breaking information and equipment of the type
that Whitworth allegedly furnished.
The point is potentially crucial to the case be
cause Whitworth. a former Navy radioman, is
charged with selling secrets to Walker for
$332,000 with the knowledge and intention that
the material would be relayed to the Soviet Un
ion.
