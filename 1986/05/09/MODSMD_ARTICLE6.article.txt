# Developers, diggers duel
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
It's Saturday morning and most Stanford students
are nestled snugly in bed, while visions of Friday
night's parties dance in their heads.
But some students are in class. The course is Ar
chaeological Field Methods, meeting all day every

Saturday during spring quarter, and the classroom is
a 5x6-meter rectangle of earth along San Fran
cisquito Creek on the west side of the Stanford
campus.
Thirty students are scattered around the site, dig
ging, sifting earth, bagging and labeling fragments
of bone and rock. The evidence they find suggests
that humans lived along the creek between 1,000
and 2,000 years ago.
Around the dig lies a huge meadow, stretching
from the creek to Willow Road, and from the Stan
ford Children's Hospital to the Oak Creek Apart
ments. This 46-acre plot of land has become the
center of a controversy in past months. At the heart
of the controversy lies a tug-of-war between the ex
igencies of development and the demands of schol
arship.

Feature
The Stanford West land is
coveted by both University real
estate officials as the site of a pro
posed faculty-staff housing devel
opment, and by campus ar
chaeologists as a rich reservoir of
information about prehistoric in
habitants of the Bay Area.
Robin Hamill, director of Uni
versity Real Estate and Develop
ment, says the land is "the biggest
flat field zoned for on-campus
housing."
John Rick, professor of anthro
pology and the instructor of the
Archaeological Field Methods,
calls it"the last open area along a
Peninsula creekbed that is still
available for research."
University officials are currently
at work attempting to reconcile
the conflict between the two
groups. A task force, headed by
Statistics Prof. Lincoln Moses, as
sociate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, has done a study of the
proposed housing project and its
impact on the archaeological site.
The task force will issue a report
later this spring, according to
Rick.
University Provost James Rosse
will then determine "how much of
the parcel he is willing to commit
to an archaeological preserve,"
says Hamill.
Understandably, both sides
want to maximize the amount of
land allotted to their respective
enterprises.
For Rick, it comes down to a
question of "how an academic in
stitution can be as attentive as pos
sible to the archaeological situa
tion." Stanford is one of the few
universities that has an active ar
chaeological dig on its own land,
and campus archaeologists would
like to make it a permanent part of
the University's resources.
For Hamill, the Stanford West
land offers a key to solving a long
standing University faculty-staff
housing crisis.
"We'd obviously love to have
the whole thing," says Hamill.

"The faculty-staff housing crunch
has been pretty continuous since
1979."
According to Rick, a quarter of
the Stanford West land was "at
one time or another inhabited."
Native Americans lived there be
cause of the proximity to the
creek, he said.
The report of the Moses task
force is "likely to take an inter
mediate position, asking for
preservation of at least some of
the archaeological resources,"
Rick says.
"We have a pretty fair idea of
where stuff is. Twelve acres repre
sent a real core of the deposit .. .
they are very important sites, ar
chaeologically.
"If they don't preserve at least
12 acres, there will be real trouble
in constructing on areas with
human burials," Rick says."It
would create some real unhappi
ness in the native American com
munity."
Regardless of the results of the
task force study, it will be some
time before the Stanford West
housing project begins construc
tion, according to Hamill.
The city of Palo Alto had objec
tions to the density of the original
Stanford West design. A new
design must be drawn up to ac
commodate both city specifica
tions and whatever restrictions
may be placed on the project by
the University.
In addition, a second environ
mental impact report must be
prepared on the project.
"There are just several steps we
need to go through .. . it's a long
and arduous process," says
Hamill. "In the best of all possible
worlds, it will be two to two-and
a-half years before we get a shovel
in the ground."
Rick's students already have
their shovels in the ground, and
hope to have the chance to keep
them there for some years to
come.
"There are two very high
priorities at work here," says Rick.
"Archaeologists are very stuck on
their sites; planners are very stuck
on their location."
