# Developers, diggers duel
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
It's Saturday morning and most Stanford students
are nestled snugly in bed, while visions of Friday
night's parties dance in their heads.
But some students are in class. The course is Ar
chaeological Field Methods, meeting all day every

Saturday during spring quarter, and the classroom is
a 5x6-meter rectangle of earth along San Fran
cisquito Creek on the west side of the Stanford
campus.
Thirty students are scattered around the site, dig
ging, sifting earth, bagging and labeling fragments
of bone and rock. The evidence they find suggests
that humans lived along the creek between 1,000
and 2,000 years ago.
Around the dig lies a huge meadow, stretching
from the creek to Willow Road, and from the Stan
ford Children's Hospital to the Oak Creek Apart
ments. This 46-acre plot of land has become the
center of a controversy in past months. At the heart
of the controversy lies a tug-of-war between the ex
igencies of development and the demands of schol
arship.
