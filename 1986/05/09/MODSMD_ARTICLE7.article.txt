# Groups to rally for divestiture
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
A coalition of student groups in fa
vor of divestment will stage an anti
apartheid celebration and demonstra
tion Monday at noon, featuring South
African activist Dennis Brutus.
Beginning in White Plaza, the rally
will march to Hoover Tower, where
Stanford's Board of Trustees is hold
ing committee meetings in prepara
tion for Tuesday's full board meeting.
Speakers at the rally will be Brutus
and Charles N'cho, an ecomonics
professor at the University of San
Francisco who spoke at last year's
open forum on divestment.
Also on Monday, three students
will address trustees on the issue of
total divestment during the morning
meeting of the board's Special Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility

(S-CIR).
The students will present their case
for total divestment of University
funds from companies that do busi
ness in South Africa, according to
Will Masters, a graduate student at
the Food Research Institute.
"The time has come when lip
service (to the immorality of apart
heid) is inappropriate. What is called
for is direct action," said law student
Basavan Samuel, the only black
South African student at Stanford.
Samuel is also the chair of a student
council that represents the interests
of the 400 to 500 black South African
students in the United States.
Masters, Samuel and senior Paula
Groves, the student representative to
the trustee's Committee on Invest
ments, are the three who will address
the S-CIR.
Masters has requested that a mem

ber of the Black Student Union
(BSU) also be present at the S-CIR
meeting. Although the University has
not yet replied, the request will prob
ably be granted, according to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
"We want to emphasize two
points," Masters said. "One. the sit
uation in South Africa demands ac
tion — something — from the trus
tees and from this University. Two,
action should be focused on the prob
lems in South Africa as opposed to
individual companies."
Stanford's current policy of
selective divestment partially bases a
decision for or against divestment on
a company's adherence to the Sul
livan Principles, a rating system based
on a code of behavior for foreign
companies in the apartheid nation.
The decision to divest should be
based on the immorality of apartheid
and not on the extent to which a com
pany improves working conditions for
black and colored employees, accord
ing to Masters.

The trustee committee will be pre
sented with the results of last month's
ASSU referendum on divestment,
which won about 3,200 votes in favor
of total divestment, and a similar
SOSA petition that received about
1,500 signatures.
"Trustees will only act (on divest
ment) because students want them
to," Masters said, emphasizing that
demonstrations of the depth of stu

dent interest and sincerity are impor
tant in gaining results on divestment.
"I hope a lot of people come on
Monday," he added.
Monday's rally is sponsored by a
number of student organizations, in
cluding the BSU, SASA (Stanford
African Student Association) and
SOSA (Stanford Out of South
Africa).
