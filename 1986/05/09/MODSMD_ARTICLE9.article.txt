The Stanford University Summer
Conference Office will be hosting
more than 150 conferences with
14,000 participants this summer, ac
cording to Office Manager Lois
•Fariello.
, "It'd be a waste not to use the
[facilities that we have in the sum
mer," Fariello said. "Our mainte
nance costs go on in the summer.
;They don't end when the students go
• home. Housing, food service, the
Bookstore, etc. — they all still oper
ate."
Fariello added that approximately
;$4 million will be contributed to
housing and food services alone from
summer visitors.
, As a non-profit institution, Stan
ford cannot actively solicit summer
!visitors. But the University has its
'ways.
. "We have a well-established pro
gram," Fariello said. "Stanford has
an appealing academic reputation;
.people want to be associated with
As well, we have repeat
;groups, groups that come back year
•after year. Word of mouth is also very
.important to our program. People
gome here and they let everyone else

know what a great place this is. Even
tually, people will come see what
everyone's talking about."
Fariello also said that Stanford's
beautiful campus is instrumental in
attracting visitors.
The money that the Conference
Office receives goes back to housing
and food service, making student
room-and-board rates less expensive.
"Harvard's room and board rates
went up by a larger percentage last
year than ours did," Fariello said.
"This year ours will go up by some
thing like 6.4 percent; Harvard's
percentage will be higher."
Fariello attributed Stanford's abil
ity to keep its room-and-board rates
down to a minimum in large part to
her summer conference program.
"We make a big difference," she said.
In order for a conference to be held
at Stanford it must be sponsored by a
University department. It also must
satisfy the University's policy of
public service, teaching and research.
Still, there are compelling incen
tives for Stanford professors to spon
sor such conferences.
"There are many reasons," Fariello
said. "Sharing research is one impor
tant one. The conferences provide a
great opportunity to see what is going
on in a given field. Also, a lot of

grants are available for the professors
participating in these conferences."
Fariello also added that the confer
ences provide the professors with the
opportunity to continue their teach
ing and research throughout the sum
mer.
But the professors aren't the only
ones who benefit from summer con
ferences. Football Coach Jack Elway
and his son, Denver Broncos quarter
back John Elway, will be giving their
third Stanford Football Camp this
summer. Approximately 500 people
between the ages of 10 and 18 will be
housed as part of the Elways' pro
gram.
According to Fariello, Mike
Montgomery, the University's new
basketball coach, will also be holding
a camp session.
Finally, the summer conferences
can entice prospective students to ap
ply to Stanford. "We get Junior
Statesmen here; high schoolers
who've showed outstanding leader
ship potential," said Fariello. Ac
cordingly, the Conference Office now
places information concerning admis
sions in the dorms where the students
stay.
"Stanford is a great place to work,"
said Fariello.'
