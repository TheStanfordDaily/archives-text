# University policies challenged at forum
## Audience vents anger 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Ihe cards were stacked against the administration at
Friday night's forum.
Early in the event, as senior David Troutt drew cheers
trom the audience by calling for a "complete overhaul" of
the University's "ethnocentric" Western Culture pro
gram, a white-haired man in the front row stood up, lifted
his arms above his head, threw them down toward the
stage in disgust and stomped out of Cubberley Audito
rium.
He appeared to represent the administration's entire
line of moral support.

News Analysis

The 450-person audience applauded nearly every
charge against the administration, cheering speakers who
called for divestment, fairer dealings with United Stanford
Workers and non-union staff and a more democratic
decision-making process at the University.
The five speakers representing the Stanford community
were repeatedly interrupted by applause, and more than
150 persons gave Troutt a standing ovation at the end of
his speech.
By contrast, the five officials representing the adminis
tration received only polite applause at the end of their
talks, and it was hissing and heckling rather than clapping
and cheering that interrupted their speeches.
University President Donald Kennedy, offering final
thoughts in response to the last question of the night, said
it is neither his nor the administration s "purpose to do
away with representation for Stanford workers."
"Bullshit!" yelled a disbeliever.

Friday night's forum audience responded enthusiastically to David Troutt's persuasive
demand for a new World Culture program to replace the current Western Culture pro
gram.
and longtime critic of the administra
tion, said he felt the Cubberley audi
ence accurately reflected the
sentiments of the whole Stanford
community.
"You had 300 or 400 people there.
That's good enough for most
meetings," he said.
Stanford Personnel Director Rob
Parker was less convinced.
"The people with the strongest
feelings were the ones who came to
the forum,'' said Parker, one of the
event's chief organizers.
Parker, who sat on the administra
tion's side of the panel, said the
forum failed to promote constructive
dialogue, largely because of the loud,
one-sided audience.
"I didn't think it was the kind of
exchange of ideas we had hoped for,"
he said. "1 think it's tough to have a
constructive dialogue when there is
that much cheering."
Asked whether the administration
will support another forum of this
sort, Parker said,"lt's hard to tell yet.
We need to get a sense of. . . people's
reactions."
Manley called the forum "an un
precedented event that you couldn't
find unless you went back to the
'605."
He said the forum succeeded in

showing the "depths of dissension
over (administration) policies." and
he said he hoped Kennedy would
agree to hold forums "on a regular
basis â€” once a quarter would be
about right."
All 10 members of the Stanford
community who addressed the panel
during the question and answer per
iod expressed disapproval with
aspects of the University's gover
nance and policies. Most of those in
dividuals used their moment in the
spotlight to give speeches of their
own, rather than simply ask questions
of the panel members. Consequently,
the administration was not asked to
give its views on some of the issues
raised.
The administrators did not address
the alleged ethnocentricity in the
Western Culture program, but Ken
nedy, speaking after the forum, said
he supported initiatives for change
and expressed his desire to help inter
ested students find "faculty advo
cates."
Kennedy, who fielded most of the
questions directed at the administra
tion panel, made several concessions
in response to accusations.
The academic staff is under
represented on University commit
tees, Stanford Hospital has been put
at greater distance from the Univer
sity, and the Committee on Student
Services-Residences has been inef
fective this year, he said.
Some administration responses dis

played an apparent lack of
communication between the higher
and lower levels of the University
hierarchy.
A Florence Moore Hall food ser
vice worker told the panel that his su
pervisor of three years was a
renowned tyrant, and Linda Crouse,
chief steward of the USW and a
member of the panel, said the USW
had been frustrated in its attempts to
alert the University to the actions of
that supervisor.
Yet Parker and Amy Blue, director
of Facilities and Services, said they
had no knowledge of problems with
the Florence Moore supervisor.
A SLAC engineer said he and his
co-workers face "indignities that are
outrageous" because of a University
bureaucracy that has separated
SLAC from the purview of the Uni
versity.
"I had no idea that things had come
to such a pass out there," Kennedy
replied. "1 pledge you a visit to
SLAC."
Officials on the panel, particulary
Faculty Senate Chair Elie Abel,
refuted the charge that the University
subordinates teaching to research.
Abel asserted that Stanford is an
"educational enterprise" whose cru
cial components are students and
teachers and whose primary goal is
the dissemination of knowledge.
Kennedy maintained that Stanford
is "first and foremost a teaching insti
tution."
