# University policies challenged at forum
## Audience vents anger 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Ihe cards were stacked against the administration at
Friday night's forum.
Early in the event, as senior David Troutt drew cheers
trom the audience by calling for a "complete overhaul" of
the University's "ethnocentric" Western Culture pro
gram, a white-haired man in the front row stood up, lifted
his arms above his head, threw them down toward the
stage in disgust and stomped out of Cubberley Audito
rium.
He appeared to represent the administration's entire
line of moral support.

News Analysis

The 450-person audience applauded nearly every
charge against the administration, cheering speakers who
called for divestment, fairer dealings with United Stanford
Workers and non-union staff and a more democratic
decision-making process at the University.
The five speakers representing the Stanford community
were repeatedly interrupted by applause, and more than
150 persons gave Troutt a standing ovation at the end of
his speech.
By contrast, the five officials representing the adminis
tration received only polite applause at the end of their
talks, and it was hissing and heckling rather than clapping
and cheering that interrupted their speeches.
University President Donald Kennedy, offering final
thoughts in response to the last question of the night, said
it is neither his nor the administration s "purpose to do
away with representation for Stanford workers."
"Bullshit!" yelled a disbeliever.

demand for a new World Culture program to replace the current Western Culture pro
gram.
