## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Pay heed to fire alarms 
### 
You're taking a nap in the early afternoon. You've
got the door locked, the pillow over your head and
you're almost unconscious when you hear, for what
seems like the hundredth time this quarter, the blare of
the fire alarm.
"No way," you think. "Someone pulled the handle
again." And you roll against the wall and settle down
to sleep through the familiar braying of the red and
white box, secure in the knowledge that it's just an
other false alarm.
If the day was March 3, 1980 and you were asleep in
Storey House, you might have made a fatal mistake.
All 39 residents of the house evacuated safely that
afternoon, when a faulty electrical connection behind a
refrigerator led to a three-alarm fire that gutted the
80-year-old house. If some of those residents had
taken the same laissez-faire attitude toward alarms
that many Stanford students do now, however, it could
have been a lot worse.

It's difficult for us to simply shake a pedantic finger
at the students who turn over and cover their ears
when the alarm goes off, considering how often Stan
ford alarms go off. You can only huddle out on the red
dot so many nights before thinking, "Why do 1 even
bother coming out here?"
The source of the problem is the small group of stu
dents who are responsible for the false alarms, whether
by setting small fires in the hall — as in the incident at
Roble last week — or by pulling the box's handle. If
students are to be expected to take the fire warnings
seriously, we must greatly reduce the frequency of
those false alarms.
One way might be to follow the lead of some
elementary schools, which have paint guns on alarms
to mark the handle-puller, or New York City, where
alarms have invisible dust that suspects can be tested
for. These admittedly childish precautions shouldn't be
necessary, but in the interests of safety, it seems that
we may have to consider them soon.
