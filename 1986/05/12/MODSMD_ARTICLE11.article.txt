# Protests alienate students
## 
### 
Once upon a time, students at Stanford looked upon
anti-apartheid protesters here with interest and sympathy.
Most even felt at least a mild solidarity with them. But
that was long ago. Today when students look at anti
apartheid protesters they see shack-builders, ralliers and
marchers who are little more than nuisances.

A year ago, campus discussion sparked by protesters
focused on apartheid, townships and passbooks. The
leaflets they passed out and the constructive discussions
they led in the early months of 1985 piqued students' in
terest and generated support for protests against apart
heid.
But over the past few months, protesters have
succeeded only in making themselves and their activities
conversation topics. Condemnations of apartheid in stu
dent dormitories and on the pages of The Daily have been
replaced by condemnations of offensive shanties and self
righteous and arrogant protesters.
Protesters used to raise students' ire against apartheid.
Now the only ire they raise is against the eyesores they
build in the Quad and the amplified noise they make in
White Plaza.
Stanford anti-apartheid protesters learned a lot of
things at training school: how to stage a rally, how to
make signs, how to build shanties, how to hold press con
ferences. But they failed to learn one important thing, and
they didn't have enough common sense to learn it on their
own: that essential rule of political activism. Know Your
Campus.

Building shanties and plastering their sides with slogans
turns off the majority of Stanford students and seriously
offends a large number of them. Chanting simple-minded
slogans at rallies and marches has similar appeal. It would
seem that the protesters didn't think much about how to
keep broad-based student support and how to avoid
alienating students at Stanford.
In the past year protesters' actions at Stanford have
repelled many more people than they've attracted. They
have succeeded only in taking students' attention away
from the issues of apartheid and focusing it on themselves
and their means of protest.
The recent vote to divest by the ASSU Senate and
today's presentation to the Board of Trustees by the Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility have nothing to do
with this year's rallies, shanties and marches. All are the
result of actions set in motion many months ago.

In the past year protesters'
actions at Stanford have
repelled many more people
than they've attracted.

If the Stanford protesters' goals are truly to help end
apartheid and push for divestment, they would best serve
their cause by dismantling their shanties, putting away
their placards, unplugging their microphones and going
home.
After today's rally/march, maybe the leaders of the
protests will finally go home and begin a group autobiog
raphy. Possible titles might include "How We Alienated a
Sympathetic Campus" and"From Leaders to Laughing
Stocks."
