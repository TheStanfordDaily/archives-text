## Nuclear accident misperceptions 
### 
The recent accident at the Chernobyl plant was a
disaster which should never have occurred. Blatant
disregard for reasonable precautions may have cost
the health and lives of thousands of human beings.
Clearly, nuclear energy policy is a matter of life and
death — an issue that demands rational considera
tion, not emotional polemics. Unfortunately, Hugh
Gusterson s viewpoint article (The Daily, May 6),
"Nuclear Power Is Suicide," not only fails to add
any constructive points to a vital debate, but in
dulges in dangerously misleading and confused
rhetoric. Mr. Gusterson certainly has a flair for ex
plicit portrayals of lingering death and for dark in
timations of conspiratorial cover-ups in high places.
But in glossing the facts of nuclear mishaps, in
equating nuclear plants with nuclear bombs and in
drawing parallels between "witch-doctor magic"
and atomic physics (which must come as a shock to
the majority of Stanford physicists, who seldom
look for paranormal explanations of physical
events), he fails to treat the issue with the clear
headedness it deserves. Instead of asking rhetorical
questions such as "When will we ever learn?" we
should be deciding "How should we act on what we
have learned?"
What we have learned are certain facts:

• The 1957 Windscale accident, like the 1957
Kyshtym, 1974 Shevchenko and 1986 Chernobyl
accidents, occurred in a plant without the safety sys
tems that prevented significant health hazards at
Three Mile Island.
• The Chalk River accident of 1952 (not 1958, as
Gusterson maintains), the Idaho Falls accident of
1961 and the Fermi accident of 1966 all occurred

in experimental plants, before the implementation
of modern safety equipment. Idaho Falls was, in
fact, an Army miniature test reactor designed to
test reactor safety.
• Nuclear plants are not nuclear weapons. They
cannot explode like a nuclear bomb, and they are
certainly not dropped by B-47E or B-52 bombers
or carried by Titan II missiles. I would agree with
Mr. Gusterson and Stanford Against Nuclear Dis
armament that the continued stockpiling of nuclear
weapons is dangerous and destabilizing; but that is
a separate issue deserving of its own special consid
eration. Case histories of nuclear weapons acci
dents have no place in an article on the safety of

nuclear plants. They merely serve to increase an ir
rational public fear of anything prefixed " nuclear."
• The health risks of nuclear power are still much
lower than those posed by most industries, includ
ing conventional power industries. Coal-mining
accidents and acid rain are just a few examples of
hazards that demonstrably endanger human safety
and the environment more than nuclear energy.
No leader in the Unites States today says
"accidents don't happen." On the contrary, they al
ways have, they always will, and anyone who
believes that a technological society can be risk
free is living a pipe dream. If we are to minimize
these risks, however, we have to approach them ra
tionally. We cannot afford to get rid of motor
vehicles because of automobile accidents, aircraft
because of terrorists or nuclear plants because of
reactor accidents. Each of these technologies offers
benefits that far outweigh its risks, provided
reasonable precautions are taken. In light of this, I
would much prefer to follow leaders willing to
make these rational assessments, rather than follow
the confused call of those who seem capable of
little more than impassioned rhetoric.
