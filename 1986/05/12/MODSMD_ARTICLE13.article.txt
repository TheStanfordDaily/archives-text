## Support immunization legislation 
### 
Each year approximately 14 million chidren un
der the age of six die of malnutrition and disease in
Third World countries. Of these, 3.5 million die
from measles, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, diph
theria and tuberculosis. Also as a result of these
diseases, an equal number of children will survive
but suffer some form of physical impairment. UNI
CEF estimates that all of these diseased can be
prevented through vaccinations for a cost as little as
SIO per child. As such, an international effort,
coordinated by UNICEF with a goal of universal
child immunization by 1990. is currently underway.
As of mid-1985, 44 countries had launched ex
panded immunization programs and already, 8.3
million children have been vaccinated. For exam
ple. a massive volunteer effort in Colombia has
seen 800,000 children immunized and the civil war
in El Salvador was literally stopped on three sepa
rate occasions as the country united to vaccinate its

children.
Participating countries are expected to bear 80
percent of the costs of these efforts, with the
remainder of funds coming from developed na
tions. Therefore, in order to promote participation
by the United States, Bread for the World, a
nationwide, ecumenical Christian organization

P. ANDK. MEAGHER

which lobbies Congress on domestic and interna
tional hunger issues, is seeking Congressional sup
port for the Universal Child Immunization Act of
1986 (H.R. 3894 and S. 1917). This legislation
would provide $50 million toward this interna
tional effort — a figure which amounts to less than
one-third of 1 percent of annual U.S. foreign aid
expenditures.

How would a worldwide immunization campaign
reduce the millions of childhood deaths a year
which stem from hunger-related causes? For one
thing, vaccination is expecially important to hungry
children who do not have the reserves of strength
necessary to fight dissease. Disease can also be the
cause of hunger by preventing the proper ingestion
and use of food by the body. One long-term, anti
hunger benefit of a successful immunization pro
gram is likely to be a reduction in population
growth as countries with the lowest rates of child
hood deaths have been shown to have the lowest
birth rates.
We hope that people will take an interest in this
important and potentially life-saving legislation.
