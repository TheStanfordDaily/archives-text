The recent letter to the editor by
Dan Culhane (The Daily, May 6) ad
dressing SOSA's actions gives new
meaning to the term "clueless fresh
man." The idea that Bishop Des
mond Tutu is an "extremist" is ab
surd. The black South Africans have
tried almost everything but to no
avail, because Botha has been un
receptive to any change in the apart
heid system. I suppose Mr. Culhane
would have been pleased if the black
South Africans had given up their
fight for freedom upon finding that
the system did not want to change. Is
it really extremist to desire freedom?
Mr. Culhane continues, in his let
ter, to say that we, Stanford students,
should put more thought into the
issue of divestment — the assumption
is that we have not put enough
thought into the issue already. Obvi
ously, he believes that SOSA should
sit back and wait for Stanford Univer
sity to shake off the dust and come to
a decision on divestment. This is
ridiculous, though, for the University
seems only to be willing to respond as
a result of pressure. The very fact that
the issue of divestment was not
brought up until students expressed
their outrage, demonstrates that the
University felt no need to do any
thing. This pressure being exerted on
the University comes from the
publicity that the shanties draw, and
from the ensuing dialogue. The idea
is to bring the issue before the public.

In addition, Culhane's viewpoint
proves to be historically ineffective.
For instance, if Martin Luther King
Jr. had only staged a few protests and
then waited to let everyone ponder
over whether blacks deserved full
citizenship under law, blacks would
be in the same predicament now as
they were when King first started. In
fact, we would still be English citizens
if the colonists spent their time
thinking about the oppression that
they lived under instead of acting to
change it.
The fact is, continued pressure
yields results, while inaction often
breeds apathy. The pressure and the
tactics of the SOS A movement are a
direct result of the University's
footdragging and of the ineffective
ness of words to bring about any sort
of results.
Mr. Culhane should understand
that it is not important that he ap
prove of the shanty or even deem it
aesthetically pleasing. What is impor
tant, is that people notice it and think
of the South African people. I'm sure
that if the issue was not made appar
ent through the shanties, we would all
forget about the injustice.
What Mr. Culhane must consider
(or even think about) is when we are
finished thinking, what are we going
to do to help our fellow human beings
in South Africa escape from the
predicament in which they find them
selves.

American values
misrepresented
In his response (The Daily, May 7)
to Nancy Latham's column (The
Daily, May 2) about the Sandinistas,
Isaac Winer mouths "American
values" but actually seems to espouse
imperialism abroad and McCarthyism
at home.
He thinks it's fine for Nicaraguans
to be taught to read, but only if they
aren't allowed to read anything anti-
American. He believes in "self
determination," but reserves the
United States the right to say what is
an "acceptable" Nicaraguan govern
ment. And the "true American ideals
of liberty and democracy" seem for
him to be consistent with 50 years of
American sponsorship of repression
and exploitation.
On the home front, criticism is to
be allowed but only if it does not
question the wisdom of our leaders,
the degree to which they actually rep
resent the wishes of the public and
the truth of their pronouncements —
for these would be "unpatriotic."
But "patriotism" means love of
country, not love of the current gov
ernment. Dissent is not treason. It is
the duty of the patriot to point out the
government's lies time and again, and
to stop the evil being done in our
name.

imperialism abroad and McCarthyism
at home.
He thinks it's fine for Nicaraguans
to be taught to read, but only if they
aren't allowed to read anything anti-
American. He believes in "self
determination," but reserves the
United States the right to say what is
an "acceptable" Nicaraguan govern
ment. And the "true American ideals
of liberty and democracy" seem for
him to be consistent with 50 years of
American sponsorship of repression
and exploitation.
On the home front, criticism is to
be allowed but only if it does not
question the wisdom of our leaders,
the degree to which they actually rep
resent the wishes of the public and
the truth of their pronouncements —
for these would be "unpatriotic."
But "patriotism" means love of
country, not love of the current gov
ernment. Dissent is not treason. It is
the duty of the patriot to point out the
government's lies time and again, and
to stop the evil being done in our
name.
