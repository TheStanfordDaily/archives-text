"Right after the prison system and
the military, the corporation is the
least democratic institution in
America, and Stanford is right up
there," said Green Librarian Lise
Giraud.
Although University governance
may be "seen as monolithic and top
down," it is "in fact highly
decentralized," countered University
President Donald Kennedy.
"It is very difficult to get anything
done . . . without broad consensus,"
Kennedy said.
The speakers offered their views at
a Cubberley Auditorium forum
Friday night on issues of University
governance and policies.
The idea for the forum grew out of
labor issues raised in the fall when the
United Stanford Workers were
negotiating a new contract with the
University. Organizers of the event
later expanded the scope of the forum
to cover several aspects of University
governance and decision-making
processes.
The five panelists speaking against
the administration came from all
areas of the Stanford community, but
they had at least one thing in com
mon.
"We have all tried to talk to the ad
ministration on various issues, but
without much success," said Political
Science Prof. John Manley, one of the

speakers.
Manley. who in the past has spoken
out against ties between the Univer
sity and the Hoover Institution,
charged that the administration stifles
open and free discussion.
"It is good that we are here
tonight," Manley said. "It will be
even better if out of this discussion
comes a new openness to full partici
pation in University decision-making,
new respect for opposing views and a
consensus that all members of this
community have a right to be heard
— and, unless their arguments are
convincingly refuted, the right to
have their views define Stanford's
policies."
Other panelists criticized the ad
ministration for its dealings with
United Stanford Workers and with
non-union staff and students.
The five speakers representing the
University administration described
the roles of the Board of Trustees,
administrators, faculty and workers at
Stanford.
After members on each side of the
panel made short speeches, the
panelists were offered the chance to
cross-examine one another, but both
sides opted to move directly to the
program's next segment — questions
from the audience.
Most of the 450-person audience
appeared to back the challengers to
the administration, marking what
Linda Crouse, chief steward of USW,
called an increasingly close relation
ship between activist students and un
ion members at American univer
sities.
Crouse, speaking after the forum,
noted that Stanford students have
been increasingly supportive of USW
in the last two years.
The panelists who represented the
community each discussed different
issues.
Giraud challenged University af
firmative action policies and
democracy in the workplace.
"In significant portions of the Uni
versity, the first commandment is to
uphold the hierarchy," she said.
University governance looks dem
ocratic on the surface, Giraud said,
but "more often than not, it turns out
that we are merely squandering our
energies to matters that have already
been decided above us, often con
trary to broad-based staff views, by a
directorship that lost the confidence
of its staff years ago."
Giraud said that the University's
"grievance procedure for redressing
injustices is hardly worthy of the
name."
Crouse, a maintenance worker at
Tresidder Union, also challenged the
allegedly undemocratic University
governance structure. She charged,
that "the governance of Stanford is
now in the hands of a small number of
mostly white, male, anti-labor, cor

porate businessmen, trustees and ad
ministrators who have little in com
mon with the University community.
"When the rights of a worker, or
staff person, or student, or even fac
ulty person are violated," Crouse
said, "we are all diminished."
Senior David Troutt criticized the
Western Culture requirement as
racist, sexist and ethnocentric dogma
staked in an "arrogant scholastic
chauvinism (which) has a tradition as
old as western scholarship itself."
The Western Culture sequence "is
not just racist education, it is the edu
cation of racists," Troutt said, garner
ing applause and cheers with the
statement and a standing ovation
after his speech.
The administration's speakers dis
cussed the importance of teachers,
students and workers to the Univer
sity.
Amy Blue, director of Facilities
and Services, said that the administra
tion seeks input from staff "at all
levels."
"People are the key," she said,
calling them "our most valuable as
set."
Personnel Director Rob Parker
asserted that management-labor rela
tions are characteristically adver
sarial, noting that Stanford is no ex
ception. He added that the USW,
with more than 1,300 maintenance,
service and technical workers, is par
ticularly difficult to represent because
of its diversity.
Parts of the forum revolved around
what ought to be the primary role of
the University. Kennedy defined the

University as a private trust for the
public good.
During the question period, mem
bers of the audience said that their
definition of the "public good' dif
fered from the administration's.
Kennedy said he and the trustees
by necessity think of "the students
not yet admitted or born, experi
ments not yet conducted and faculty
not yet appointed" when making
decisions.
"We find ourselves frequently ar
guing for the future against the pres
ent," he said, "because it's right and
because we are legally required'' to
do so.
The University "can't be, doesn't
know how to be and doesn't have the
resources to be all things to all
people," Kennedy responded. "But it
can be the best university it can be."
Manley repeated a charge he has
made more than once in the past,
saying the administration values re
search more highly than teaching.
"No one is saying the administra
tion does not care about good teach
ing," he said. "Awards are provided
for it, and it is taken into account. It is
just second."
Kennedy refuted the charge, em
phasizing that Stanford's mission is
educational and calling the University
"first and foremost a teaching institu
tion."
"It is the educational purpose for
which we were established and for
which we exist."
In closing, Kennedy indicated that
the administration might agree to
hold another forum.
"Right after the prison system and
the military, the corporation is the
least democratic institution in
America, and Stanford is right up
there," said Green Librarian Lise
Giraud.

the administration might agree to
hold another forum.
"Right after the prison system and
the military, the corporation is the
least democratic institution in
America, and Stanford is right up
there," said Green Librarian Lise
Giraud.
Although University governance
may be "seen as monolithic and top
down," it is "in fact highly
decentralized," countered University
President Donald Kennedy.
"It is very difficult to get anything
done . . . without broad consensus,"
Kennedy said.
The speakers offered their views at
a Cubberley Auditorium forum
Friday night on issues of University
governance and policies.
The idea for the forum grew out of
labor issues raised in the fall when the
United Stanford Workers were
negotiating a new contract with the
University. Organizers of the event
later expanded the scope of the forum
to cover several aspects of University
governance and decision-making
processes.
The five panelists speaking against
the administration came from all
areas of the Stanford community, but
they had at least one thing in com
mon.
"We have all tried to talk to the ad
ministration on various issues, but
without much success," said Political
Science Prof. John Manley, one of the

speakers.
Manley. who in the past has spoken
out against ties between the Univer
sity and the Hoover Institution,
charged that the administration stifles
open and free discussion.
"It is good that we are here
tonight," Manley said. "It will be
even better if out of this discussion
comes a new openness to full partici
pation in University decision-making,
new respect for opposing views and a
consensus that all members of this
community have a right to be heard
— and, unless their arguments are
convincingly refuted, the right to
have their views define Stanford's
policies."
Other panelists criticized the ad
ministration for its dealings with
United Stanford Workers and with
non-union staff and students.
The five speakers representing the
University administration described
the roles of the Board of Trustees,
administrators, faculty and workers at
Stanford.
After members on each side of the
panel made short speeches, the
panelists were offered the chance to
cross-examine one another, but both
sides opted to move directly to the
program's next segment — questions
from the audience.
Most of the 450-person audience
appeared to back the challengers to
the administration, marking what
Linda Crouse, chief steward of USW,
called an increasingly close relation
ship between activist students and un
ion members at American univer
sities.
Crouse, speaking after the forum,
noted that Stanford students have
been increasingly supportive of USW
in the last two years.
The panelists who represented the
community each discussed different
issues.
Giraud challenged University af
firmative action policies and
democracy in the workplace.
"In significant portions of the Uni
versity, the first commandment is to
uphold the hierarchy," she said.
University governance looks dem
ocratic on the surface, Giraud said,
but "more often than not, it turns out
that we are merely squandering our
energies to matters that have already
been decided above us, often con
trary to broad-based staff views, by a
directorship that lost the confidence
of its staff years ago."
Giraud said that the University's
"grievance procedure for redressing
injustices is hardly worthy of the
name."
Crouse, a maintenance worker at
Tresidder Union, also challenged the
allegedly undemocratic University
governance structure. She charged,
that "the governance of Stanford is
now in the hands of a small number of
mostly white, male, anti-labor, cor

porate businessmen, trustees and ad
ministrators who have little in com
mon with the University community.
"When the rights of a worker, or
staff person, or student, or even fac
ulty person are violated," Crouse
said, "we are all diminished."
Senior David Troutt criticized the
Western Culture requirement as
racist, sexist and ethnocentric dogma
staked in an "arrogant scholastic
chauvinism (which) has a tradition as
old as western scholarship itself."
The Western Culture sequence "is
not just racist education, it is the edu
cation of racists," Troutt said, garner
ing applause and cheers with the
statement and a standing ovation
after his speech.
The administration's speakers dis
cussed the importance of teachers,
students and workers to the Univer
sity.
Amy Blue, director of Facilities
and Services, said that the administra
tion seeks input from staff "at all
levels."
"People are the key," she said,
calling them "our most valuable as
set."
Personnel Director Rob Parker
asserted that management-labor rela
tions are characteristically adver
sarial, noting that Stanford is no ex
ception. He added that the USW,
with more than 1,300 maintenance,
service and technical workers, is par
ticularly difficult to represent because
of its diversity.
Parts of the forum revolved around
what ought to be the primary role of
the University. Kennedy defined the

University as a private trust for the
public good.
During the question period, mem
bers of the audience said that their
definition of the "public good' dif
fered from the administration's.
Kennedy said he and the trustees
by necessity think of "the students
not yet admitted or born, experi
ments not yet conducted and faculty
not yet appointed" when making
decisions.
"We find ourselves frequently ar
guing for the future against the pres
ent," he said, "because it's right and
because we are legally required'' to
do so.
The University "can't be, doesn't
know how to be and doesn't have the
resources to be all things to all
people," Kennedy responded. "But it
can be the best university it can be."
Manley repeated a charge he has
made more than once in the past,
saying the administration values re
search more highly than teaching.
"No one is saying the administra
tion does not care about good teach
ing," he said. "Awards are provided
for it, and it is taken into account. It is
just second."
Kennedy refuted the charge, em
phasizing that Stanford's mission is
educational and calling the University
"first and foremost a teaching institu
tion."
"It is the educational purpose for
which we were established and for
which we exist."
In closing, Kennedy indicated that
the administration might agree to
hold another forum.
