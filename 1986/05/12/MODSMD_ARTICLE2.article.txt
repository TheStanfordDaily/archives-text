"Right after the prison system and
the military, the corporation is the
least democratic institution in
America, and Stanford is right up
there," said Green Librarian Lise
Giraud.
Although University governance
may be "seen as monolithic and top
down," it is "in fact highly
decentralized," countered University
President Donald Kennedy.
"It is very difficult to get anything
done . . . without broad consensus,"
Kennedy said.
The speakers offered their views at
a Cubberley Auditorium forum
Friday night on issues of University
governance and policies.
The idea for the forum grew out of
labor issues raised in the fall when the
United Stanford Workers were

convincingly refuted, the right to
have their views define Stanford's
policies."
Other panelists criticized the ad
ministration for its dealings with
United Stanford Workers and with
non-union staff and students.
The five speakers representing the
University administration described
the roles of the Board of Trustees,
administrators, faculty and workers at
Stanford.
After members on each side of the
panel made short speeches, the
panelists were offered the chance to
cross-examine one another, but both
sides opted to move directly to the
program's next segment — questions
from the audience.
Most of the 450-person audience
appeared to back the challengers to
the administration, marking what
