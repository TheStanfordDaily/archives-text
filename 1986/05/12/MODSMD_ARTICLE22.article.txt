## Cardinal grabs two big games from Cal Playoff hopes high for team 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — Good news and
bad news. Stanford's baseball team
got a healthy dose of both this
weekend.
With Stanford's 7-3 win over Cali
fornia here yesterday, the Cardinal —
solidly in second place in the Pacific
10 Conference's Southern Division
— virtually assured itself of a berth in
a post-season regional tournament.
"We're going to be in regionals,"
said Stanford Coach Mark Marquess,
who also sits on the NCAA's post
season selection committee. "It's not
automatic, but being second in our
conference and with the schedule
we've played, they can't keep us out."
Marquess knows whereof he
speaks — the top three teams in the
Six-Pac have advanced to a post
season party in each of the last two
years.
"We weren't going out there just to
play out the season," Lee Plemel,
yesterday's winning pitcher, said.
"We were looking to clinch a berth in
the regionals . . . and we did it."
Almost as much of a story as what
the Cardinal was playing for yester
day is what it wasn't playing for.
Stanford, the two-time defending
Six-Pac champion, wasn't playing for
a share of the league title. On Satur
day, UCLA — which finished three
games ahead of the Cardinal with a
21-9 record — dethroned the Card
inal with its 6-4 win over USC.
Still, by taking two of three games
from Cal over the weekend, Stanford
enhanced its chances of hosting a
regional. "I doubt they'd (the
NCAA) let a third-place team host a
regional," Marquess said, "but now
that we're second, I'm optimistic."
The two sites for the Western
Regional are expected to be an
nounced today. Five schools — Stan
ford, Arizona, UCLA, Washington
State and Hawaii — have submitted
bids to host a post-season tourney.
Yesterday Stanford used some
crafty baserunning and the complete
game effort of Plemel to hand Cal,
the Six-Pac's doormat, a season
ending loss.
The Bears ended with a 10-20
league mark, 32-25 overall. The
Cardinal finished 18-12 in the Six-
Pac and 35-21 against all opponents.
Mark Davis, Stanford's center
fielder, staked Plemel to a quick lead
with a two-run home run to right
center in the top of the first. For
Davis, it was his third roundtripper in
as many days, and his seventh (a team
higfi) for the year.
After getting two quick outs in the
bottom of the inning, Plemel ran into
trouble. Third baseman Jerry Goff
drilled a 0-2 pitch to the wall on one
hop to score Kevin Maas from first.
Goff came across with Cal's second
run when Frank Carey misplayed
Chris Knapp's chopper to shortstop.
An inning later, Cal threatened to
rout Plemel.
With one out, Scott Mayo sliced a
base hit down the left-field line. The
ball skipped past Walt Harris and

rolled into the corner, allowing Mayo
to reach third with a triple. Mayo
scored on a sacrifice fly to center.
Then Plemel came unglued; his
pitches started to go awry. Plemel
walked the next three Bears and went
to a full count against Goff, Cal's
cleanup hitter.
"I wasn't throwing well from the
stretch," Plemel said. "I was kind of
rushing myself."
Goff fouled one full-count offering
off. Then Plemel went with his slider.
Goff, who had 18 home runs coming
into the weekend, waved and missed
— strike three, inning over. Plemel
escaped, trailing by only a single run,
3-2.
"Plemel's the kind of pitcher who
has one bad inning where they (the
opponents) have one chance to beat
him." Marquess said afterward.
"They had their chance and didn't
cash in."
Not a murmur came from Cal after
the second. The Bears managed six
singles off Plemel over the final seven
frames.
"I felt pretty good the whole
game," said Plemel, whose record im
proved to 6-3 with the win. "After
that early trouble, I settled down and
got into a good groove."
While Plemel was busy slowing
Cal, Stanford revved its offense. In
the top of the third, Davis lined a
one-out single to left. Ramos then
drew a walk from starter and loser

Mark Sampson, 4-6.
Davis and Ramos then pulled off a
double steal.
After Toi Cook skied to shallow
center for the second out, leaving
runners on second and third, Davis
gambled.
"Coach (Dean) Stotz told me he
thought we could steal home on the
guy (Sampson)," Davis said. As
Sampson went into his windup, Davis
broke from third. He slid under
catcher Mike Knapp's tag with the
game-tying run.
"That was a big one," Marquess
said. "It really changed things
around."
Sampson, shaken by Davis coup,
gave up run-scoring hits to Harris and
Sprague. When the dust finally
cleared it was 6-3, Stanford.
The Cardinal scored single runs in
the fourth and the seventh. In the
fourth, Carey reached first after
Sampson plunked him on the ankle,
stole second and moved to third on a
wild pitch. Carey snuck across as
Knapp threw down to second trying
to catch Ruben Amaro stealing.
In the seventh, Harris walked to
lead off, stole second and third and
scored on a wild pitch.
Stanford stole nine bases (in 10 at
tempts) on the afternoon to tie the
team's season high for thefts in a
single game. The Cardinal swiped a
like number in the fourth game of the
year, against the University of San

Francisco.
In Saturday's middle game, won by
Cal 9-4, the Bears erupted for three
runs in the top of seventh to spoil
Stanford's hopes of a comeback.
The Cardinal had rebounded from
a 6-0 deficit and cut Cal's lead to two
runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Ron
Witmeyer's solo home run, his second
dinger of the year, started Stanford's
four-run rally. Mark Machtolf tripled
and scored on Amaro's line drive that
Skipped off second baseman Mike
Baer's glove.
Davis and Ramos then drew walks
to load the bases. Cook followed with
a sharp base hit to right to plate Stan
ford's third run. Harris then lofted a
sacrifice fly to right.
After that the rally died. In the top
half of the seventh, Rich Aldrete —
the brother of San Francisco
farmhand and former Stanford star
Mike Aldrete — bounced a double
over Witmeyer's head at first to drive
in two Cal runs and turn the game
into a rout.
On Friday, Stanford used the
longball early — Ramos homered in
the first and Davis connected twice,
in the third and fifth innings — then
got some gutsy relief from freshman
right-hander Steve Chitren to beat
Cal 8-6.
After eight innings, the score stood
tied at five apiece.
In top of the ninth, one-out walks
to Cook and Harris got Stanford

started. Ed Sprague lined a two-strike
pitch to center to plate Cook with the
go-ahead run from second; Witmeyer
followed with a fence-rattling double
to right to score Harris. The next bat
ter, Carey, laid down a two-strike
squeeze bunt to score Stanford's
eighth run.
The lead seemed secure going into
the last of the ninth, what with Jack
McDowell on the mound for Stan
ford. But after the sophomore right
hander got the first batter in the
ninth, Lance Blankenship, to pop to
center, he walked Rich Harger. With
that Marquess called on AI Osuna,
his first man out of the bullpen, to put
out the fire.
Osuna did nothing of the sort. The
southpaw pitched himself right out of
the ballgame, giving up an RBI double
and a walk to the two hitters he faced.
Enter Chitren. Knapp greeted the
right-hander with a bloop single to
right, loading the bases and moving
the tying run into scoring position.
That's when Chitren bore down.
He fanned Jeff Weiss then got
Aldrete to chase a 3-2 slider to end
the game.
"I felt pretty good out there,"
Chitren said. "Maybe I was a little
too pumped up when I came in, but I
relaxed."
Chitren recorded his first save of
the year and preserved the win for
McDowell, 10-4.


Freshman Ron Witmeyer flipped to pitcher Rob Wassenaar for the out
at first in Saturday's losing effort against Cal, and Stanford fans flipped

center for the second out, leaving
runners on second and third, Davis
gambled.
"Coach (Dean) Stotz told me he
thought we could steal home on the
guy (Sampson)," Davis said. As
Sampson went into his windup, Davis
broke from third. He slid under
catcher Mike Knapp's tag with the
game-tying run.
"That was a big one," Marquess
said. "It really changed things
around."
Sampson, shaken by Davis coup,
gave up run-scoring hits to Harris and
Sprague. When the dust finally
cleared it was 6-3, Stanford.
The Cardinal scored single runs in
the fourth and the seventh. In the
fourth, Carey reached first after
Sampson plunked him on the ankle,
stole second and moved to third on a
wild pitch. Carey snuck across as
Knapp threw down to second trying
to catch Ruben Amaro stealing.
In the seventh, Harris walked to
lead off, stole second and third and
scored on a wild pitch.
Stanford stole nine bases (in 10 at
tempts) on the afternoon to tie the
team's season high for thefts in a
single game. The Cardinal swiped a
like number in the fourth game of the
year, against the University of San

Francisco.
In Saturday's middle game, won by
Cal 9-4, the Bears erupted for three
runs in the top of seventh to spoil
Stanford's hopes of a comeback.
The Cardinal had rebounded from
a 6-0 deficit and cut Cal's lead to two
runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Ron
Witmeyer's solo home run, his second
dinger of the year, started Stanford's
four-run rally. Mark Machtolf tripled
and scored on Amaro's line drive that
Skipped off second baseman Mike
Baer's glove.
Davis and Ramos then drew walks
to load the bases. Cook followed with
a sharp base hit to right to plate Stan
ford's third run. Harris then lofted a
sacrifice fly to right.
After that the rally died. In the top
half of the seventh, Rich Aldrete —
the brother of San Francisco
farmhand and former Stanford star
Mike Aldrete — bounced a double
over Witmeyer's head at first to drive
in two Cal runs and turn the game
into a rout.
On Friday, Stanford used the
longball early — Ramos homered in
the first and Davis connected twice,
in the third and fifth innings — then
got some gutsy relief from freshman
right-hander Steve Chitren to beat
Cal 8-6.
After eight innings, the score stood
tied at five apiece.
In top of the ninth, one-out walks
to Cook and Harris got Stanford

started. Ed Sprague lined a two-strike
pitch to center to plate Cook with the
go-ahead run from second; Witmeyer
followed with a fence-rattling double
to right to score Harris. The next bat
ter, Carey, laid down a two-strike
squeeze bunt to score Stanford's
eighth run.
The lead seemed secure going into
the last of the ninth, what with Jack
McDowell on the mound for Stan
ford. But after the sophomore right
hander got the first batter in the
ninth, Lance Blankenship, to pop to
center, he walked Rich Harger. With
that Marquess called on AI Osuna,
his first man out of the bullpen, to put
out the fire.
Osuna did nothing of the sort. The
southpaw pitched himself right out of
the ballgame, giving up an RBI double
and a walk to the two hitters he faced.
Enter Chitren. Knapp greeted the
right-hander with a bloop single to
right, loading the bases and moving
the tying run into scoring position.
That's when Chitren bore down.
He fanned Jeff Weiss then got
Aldrete to chase a 3-2 slider to end
the game.
"I felt pretty good out there,"
Chitren said. "Maybe I was a little
too pumped up when I came in, but I
relaxed."
Chitren recorded his first save of
the year and preserved the win for
McDowell, 10-4.

over the two victories that sandwiched that loss. The wins virtually
clinched an NCAA playoff berth for the Cardinal nine.
BERKELEY — Good news and
bad news. Stanford's baseball team
got a healthy dose of both this
weekend.
With Stanford's 7-3 win over Cali
fornia here yesterday, the Cardinal —
solidly in second place in the Pacific
10 Conference's Southern Division
— virtually assured itself of a berth in
a post-season regional tournament.
"We're going to be in regionals,"
said Stanford Coach Mark Marquess,
who also sits on the NCAA's post
season selection committee. "It's not
automatic, but being second in our
conference and with the schedule
we've played, they can't keep us out."
Marquess knows whereof he
speaks — the top three teams in the
Six-Pac have advanced to a post
season party in each of the last two
years.
"We weren't going out there just to
play out the season," Lee Plemel,
yesterday's winning pitcher, said.
"We were looking to clinch a berth in
the regionals . . . and we did it."
Almost as much of a story as what
the Cardinal was playing for yester
day is what it wasn't playing for.
Stanford, the two-time defending
Six-Pac champion, wasn't playing for
a share of the league title. On Satur
day, UCLA — which finished three
games ahead of the Cardinal with a
21-9 record — dethroned the Card
inal with its 6-4 win over USC.
Still, by taking two of three games
from Cal over the weekend, Stanford
enhanced its chances of hosting a
regional. "I doubt they'd (the
NCAA) let a third-place team host a
regional," Marquess said, "but now
that we're second, I'm optimistic."
The two sites for the Western
Regional are expected to be an
nounced today. Five schools — Stan
ford, Arizona, UCLA, Washington
State and Hawaii — have submitted
bids to host a post-season tourney.
Yesterday Stanford used some
crafty baserunning and the complete
game effort of Plemel to hand Cal,
the Six-Pac's doormat, a season
ending loss.
The Bears ended with a 10-20
league mark, 32-25 overall. The
Cardinal finished 18-12 in the Six-
Pac and 35-21 against all opponents.
Mark Davis, Stanford's center
fielder, staked Plemel to a quick lead
with a two-run home run to right
center in the top of the first. For
Davis, it was his third roundtripper in
as many days, and his seventh (a team
higfi) for the year.
After getting two quick outs in the
bottom of the inning, Plemel ran into
trouble. Third baseman Jerry Goff
drilled a 0-2 pitch to the wall on one
hop to score Kevin Maas from first.
Goff came across with Cal's second
run when Frank Carey misplayed
Chris Knapp's chopper to shortstop.
An inning later, Cal threatened to
rout Plemel.
With one out, Scott Mayo sliced a
base hit down the left-field line. The
ball skipped past Walt Harris and

rolled into the corner, allowing Mayo
to reach third with a triple. Mayo
scored on a sacrifice fly to center.
Then Plemel came unglued; his
pitches started to go awry. Plemel
walked the next three Bears and went
to a full count against Goff, Cal's
cleanup hitter.
"I wasn't throwing well from the
stretch," Plemel said. "I was kind of
rushing myself."
Goff fouled one full-count offering
off. Then Plemel went with his slider.
Goff, who had 18 home runs coming
into the weekend, waved and missed
— strike three, inning over. Plemel
escaped, trailing by only a single run,
3-2.
"Plemel's the kind of pitcher who
has one bad inning where they (the
opponents) have one chance to beat
him." Marquess said afterward.
"They had their chance and didn't
cash in."
Not a murmur came from Cal after
the second. The Bears managed six
singles off Plemel over the final seven
frames.
"I felt pretty good the whole
game," said Plemel, whose record im
proved to 6-3 with the win. "After
that early trouble, I settled down and
got into a good groove."
While Plemel was busy slowing
Cal, Stanford revved its offense. In
the top of the third, Davis lined a
one-out single to left. Ramos then
drew a walk from starter and loser

Mark Sampson, 4-6.
Davis and Ramos then pulled off a
double steal.
After Toi Cook skied to shallow
center for the second out, leaving
runners on second and third, Davis
gambled.
"Coach (Dean) Stotz told me he
thought we could steal home on the
guy (Sampson)," Davis said. As

"We're going to be in regionals,"
said Stanford Coach Mark Marquess,
who also sits on the NCAA's post
season selection committee. "It's not
automatic, but being second in our
conference and with the schedule
we've played, they can't keep us out."
Marquess knows whereof he
speaks — the top three teams in the
Six-Pac have advanced to a post
season party in each of the last two
years.
"We weren't going out there just to
play out the season," Lee Plemel,
yesterday's winning pitcher, said.
"We were looking to clinch a berth in
the regionals . . . and we did it."
Almost as much of a story as what
the Cardinal was playing for yester
day is what it wasn't playing for.
Stanford, the two-time defending
Six-Pac champion, wasn't playing for
a share of the league title. On Satur
day, UCLA — which finished three
games ahead of the Cardinal with a
21-9 record — dethroned the Card
inal with its 6-4 win over USC.
Still, by taking two of three games
from Cal over the weekend, Stanford
enhanced its chances of hosting a
regional. "I doubt they'd (the
NCAA) let a third-place team host a
regional," Marquess said, "but now
that we're second, I'm optimistic."
The two sites for the Western
Regional are expected to be an
nounced today. Five schools — Stan
ford, Arizona, UCLA, Washington
State and Hawaii — have submitted
bids to host a post-season tourney.
Yesterday Stanford used some
crafty baserunning and the complete
game effort of Plemel to hand Cal,
the Six-Pac's doormat, a season
ending loss.
The Bears ended with a 10-20
league mark, 32-25 overall. The
Cardinal finished 18-12 in the Six-
Pac and 35-21 against all opponents.
Mark Davis, Stanford's center
fielder, staked Plemel to a quick lead
with a two-run home run to right
center in the top of the first. For
Davis, it was his third roundtripper in
as many days, and his seventh (a team
higfi) for the year.
After getting two quick outs in the
bottom of the inning, Plemel ran into
trouble. Third baseman Jerry Goff
drilled a 0-2 pitch to the wall on one
hop to score Kevin Maas from first.
Goff came across with Cal's second
run when Frank Carey misplayed
Chris Knapp's chopper to shortstop.
An inning later, Cal threatened to
rout Plemel.
With one out, Scott Mayo sliced a
base hit down the left-field line. The
ball skipped past Walt Harris and

rolled into the corner, allowing Mayo
to reach third with a triple. Mayo
scored on a sacrifice fly to center.
Then Plemel came unglued; his
pitches started to go awry. Plemel
walked the next three Bears and went
to a full count against Goff, Cal's
cleanup hitter.
"I wasn't throwing well from the
stretch," Plemel said. "I was kind of
rushing myself."
Goff fouled one full-count offering
off. Then Plemel went with his slider.
Goff, who had 18 home runs coming
into the weekend, waved and missed
— strike three, inning over. Plemel
escaped, trailing by only a single run,
3-2.
"Plemel's the kind of pitcher who
has one bad inning where they (the
opponents) have one chance to beat
him." Marquess said afterward.
"They had their chance and didn't
cash in."
Not a murmur came from Cal after
the second. The Bears managed six
singles off Plemel over the final seven
frames.
"I felt pretty good the whole
game," said Plemel, whose record im
proved to 6-3 with the win. "After
that early trouble, I settled down and
got into a good groove."
While Plemel was busy slowing
Cal, Stanford revved its offense. In
the top of the third, Davis lined a
one-out single to left. Ramos then
drew a walk from starter and loser

Mark Sampson, 4-6.
Davis and Ramos then pulled off a
double steal.
After Toi Cook skied to shallow
center for the second out, leaving
runners on second and third, Davis
gambled.
"Coach (Dean) Stotz told me he
thought we could steal home on the
guy (Sampson)," Davis said. As
Sampson went into his windup, Davis
broke from third. He slid under
catcher Mike Knapp's tag with the
game-tying run.
"That was a big one," Marquess
said. "It really changed things
around."
Sampson, shaken by Davis coup,
gave up run-scoring hits to Harris and
Sprague. When the dust finally
cleared it was 6-3, Stanford.
The Cardinal scored single runs in
the fourth and the seventh. In the
fourth, Carey reached first after
Sampson plunked him on the ankle,
stole second and moved to third on a
wild pitch. Carey snuck across as
Knapp threw down to second trying
to catch Ruben Amaro stealing.
In the seventh, Harris walked to
lead off, stole second and third and
scored on a wild pitch.
Stanford stole nine bases (in 10 at
tempts) on the afternoon to tie the
team's season high for thefts in a
single game. The Cardinal swiped a
like number in the fourth game of the
year, against the University of San

Francisco.
In Saturday's middle game, won by
Cal 9-4, the Bears erupted for three
runs in the top of seventh to spoil
Stanford's hopes of a comeback.
The Cardinal had rebounded from
a 6-0 deficit and cut Cal's lead to two
runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Ron
Witmeyer's solo home run, his second
dinger of the year, started Stanford's
four-run rally. Mark Machtolf tripled
and scored on Amaro's line drive that
Skipped off second baseman Mike
Baer's glove.
Davis and Ramos then drew walks
to load the bases. Cook followed with
a sharp base hit to right to plate Stan
ford's third run. Harris then lofted a
sacrifice fly to right.
After that the rally died. In the top
half of the seventh, Rich Aldrete —
the brother of San Francisco
farmhand and former Stanford star
Mike Aldrete — bounced a double
over Witmeyer's head at first to drive
in two Cal runs and turn the game
into a rout.
On Friday, Stanford used the
longball early — Ramos homered in
the first and Davis connected twice,
in the third and fifth innings — then
got some gutsy relief from freshman
right-hander Steve Chitren to beat
Cal 8-6.
After eight innings, the score stood
tied at five apiece.
In top of the ninth, one-out walks
to Cook and Harris got Stanford

started. Ed Sprague lined a two-strike
pitch to center to plate Cook with the
go-ahead run from second; Witmeyer
followed with a fence-rattling double
to right to score Harris. The next bat
ter, Carey, laid down a two-strike
squeeze bunt to score Stanford's
eighth run.
The lead seemed secure going into
the last of the ninth, what with Jack
McDowell on the mound for Stan
ford. But after the sophomore right
hander got the first batter in the
ninth, Lance Blankenship, to pop to
center, he walked Rich Harger. With
that Marquess called on AI Osuna,
his first man out of the bullpen, to put
out the fire.
Osuna did nothing of the sort. The
southpaw pitched himself right out of
the ballgame, giving up an RBI double
and a walk to the two hitters he faced.
Enter Chitren. Knapp greeted the
right-hander with a bloop single to
right, loading the bases and moving
the tying run into scoring position.
That's when Chitren bore down.
He fanned Jeff Weiss then got
Aldrete to chase a 3-2 slider to end
the game.
"I felt pretty good out there,"
Chitren said. "Maybe I was a little
too pumped up when I came in, but I
relaxed."
Chitren recorded his first save of
the year and preserved the win for
McDowell, 10-4.


Freshman Ron Witmeyer flipped to pitcher Rob Wassenaar for the out
at first in Saturday's losing effort against Cal, and Stanford fans flipped

over the two victories that sandwiched that loss. The wins virtually
clinched an NCAA playoff berth for the Cardinal nine.
