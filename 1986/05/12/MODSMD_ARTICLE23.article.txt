# Davis makes mark with three homers
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — One three-game
series does not a season make, but for
Mark Davis this weekend's set with
California will have to do.
Davis, Stanford's centerfielder,
blasted three home runs — including
a two-run shot yesterday — and
drove in five runs over the weekend
to help the Cardinal take two of three
games from the Bears. Yesterday's 7-
3 win likely clinched a berth in an
NCAA post-season regional for the
Cardinal.
Nevertheless, for the senior from
San Diego, it was a sweet ending to a
long and bitter campaign.
"The end of the season's a great
time to get hot," Davis said. "But
still, it's kind of disappointing ... I
should have been hitting like this all •
along."
It's not that Davis hasn't posted
good numbers. After collecting five
hits in 12 at-bats against Cal, his
season average is up to .299; he leads
the team in home runs with seven and
doubles with 17; and his 41 RBI are
third best on the Cardinal.
None too shabby . . . but, not quite
what people expected, either.
Davis, who hit .347 last year with
13 home runs, began the year as an
All-America candidate. People
looked to the four-year veteran to be
the man in the middle of the Stanford
offense.
Instead, others — namely Toi
Cook (with a team-high 45 RBI) and
John Ramos — have stolen all the
thunder.
"I wasn't doing very much," Davis
said, "but we've had a couple of guys
really come through for us. It hasn't
been quite the year I had hoped for."
Not yet, anyway. After suffering
through an 0-for-18 slump two weeks
ago and watching his average fall to
the mid-280s, Davis has run off a
seven-game hitting skein.
"I'm seeing the ball well right
now," said Davis, who was moved to
the second spot in the battting order
this weekend, "and I'm hitting it
crisply."
It's no wonder that Davis is seeing
the ball better these days — really,
it's surprising he was seeing it at all
before.
"I've gone back to my contacts,"
said Davis, who abandoned his cor
rective lenses two years ago.
"Sometimes the ball looks like a vol
leyball when it comes up there now."
Add to his new and improved vi
sion a change in hitting mechanics
and you've got the Davis of old.
"I've gone back to last year's
stance, the deep crouch I was using,"
Davis said. "I feel like an idiot for
ever changing . . . why mess with a
good thing, eh?"
Davis sure had a good thing going
against Cal. He hit two tape-measure
home runs to left-center field Friday
— the second one, in the fifth inning
was "the best ball I've hit all year . ..
it felt really good,"' according to
Davis. In so doing, Davis became the
first Stanford player to hit more than
one home run in a game this year.
Yesterday, Davis did much of his
best work on the base paths — even
though he belted a two-run home run
in the first inning.
With Stanford down by a run and
one out in the third, Davis lined a
sharp single to left, moved to second
when Ramos walked, then stole third
base. After Cook flew out to shallow
center, Davis took matters into his
own hands.
He took a walking lead off third as
Cal's pitcher, left-hander Mark
Sampson went into his windup. Then
... he broke.
"Coach (Dean) Stotz told me he
thought we could steal home off the
guy. I took the walking lead, then
reached the point of no return."
Davis slid under Cal catcher Mike
Knapp's tag to score the game-tying
run.
"That was a real big play," Stan

ford Coach Mark Marquess said. "It
sort of changed the whole ballgame
around."
It's the kind of performance people
expect of Davis. Davis even expects it
from Davis.
"Even today was sort of disap
pointing," he said. "I got two hits in
two at-bats, then went 0-for-3. That's
frustrating."
Those are mighty high standards,
too.

Cardinal.
Nevertheless, for the senior from
San Diego, it was a sweet ending to a
long and bitter campaign.
"The end of the season's a great
time to get hot," Davis said. "But
still, it's kind of disappointing ... I
should have been hitting like this all •
along."
It's not that Davis hasn't posted
good numbers. After collecting five
hits in 12 at-bats against Cal, his
season average is up to .299; he leads
the team in home runs with seven and
doubles with 17; and his 41 RBI are
third best on the Cardinal.
None too shabby . . . but, not quite
what people expected, either.
Davis, who hit .347 last year with
13 home runs, began the year as an
All-America candidate. People
looked to the four-year veteran to be
the man in the middle of the Stanford
offense.
Instead, others — namely Toi
Cook (with a team-high 45 RBI) and
John Ramos — have stolen all the
thunder.
"I wasn't doing very much," Davis
said, "but we've had a couple of guys
really come through for us. It hasn't
been quite the year I had hoped for."
Not yet, anyway. After suffering
through an 0-for-18 slump two weeks
ago and watching his average fall to
the mid-280s, Davis has run off a
seven-game hitting skein.
"I'm seeing the ball well right
now," said Davis, who was moved to
the second spot in the battting order
this weekend, "and I'm hitting it
crisply."
It's no wonder that Davis is seeing
the ball better these days — really,
it's surprising he was seeing it at all
before.
"I've gone back to my contacts,"
said Davis, who abandoned his cor
rective lenses two years ago.
"Sometimes the ball looks like a vol
leyball when it comes up there now."
Add to his new and improved vi
sion a change in hitting mechanics
and you've got the Davis of old.
"I've gone back to last year's
stance, the deep crouch I was using,"
Davis said. "I feel like an idiot for
ever changing . . . why mess with a
good thing, eh?"
Davis sure had a good thing going
against Cal. He hit two tape-measure
home runs to left-center field Friday
— the second one, in the fifth inning
was "the best ball I've hit all year . ..
it felt really good,"' according to
Davis. In so doing, Davis became the
first Stanford player to hit more than
one home run in a game this year.
Yesterday, Davis did much of his
best work on the base paths — even
though he belted a two-run home run
in the first inning.
With Stanford down by a run and
one out in the third, Davis lined a
sharp single to left, moved to second
when Ramos walked, then stole third
base. After Cook flew out to shallow
center, Davis took matters into his
own hands.
He took a walking lead off third as
Cal's pitcher, left-hander Mark
Sampson went into his windup. Then
... he broke.
"Coach (Dean) Stotz told me he
thought we could steal home off the
guy. I took the walking lead, then
reached the point of no return."
Davis slid under Cal catcher Mike
Knapp's tag to score the game-tying
run.
"That was a real big play," Stan

ford Coach Mark Marquess said. "It
sort of changed the whole ballgame
around."
It's the kind of performance people
expect of Davis. Davis even expects it
from Davis.
"Even today was sort of disap
pointing," he said. "I got two hits in
two at-bats, then went 0-for-3. That's
frustrating."
Those are mighty high standards,
too.
