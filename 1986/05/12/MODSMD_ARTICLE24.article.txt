# Card romps in scrimmage tilt
## 
### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
The Cardinal baseball team was battling for its
playoff life in Sunken Diamond, the Grateful Dead
was jamming in Frost Amphitheater and hundreds
of Special Olympians were cavorting in DeGuerre
Pool.
Still, over 250 diehard Stanford football fans —
including former Stanford star and NFL standout
James Lofton — turned out Saturday morning to
see the Cardinal team defeat the White team 30-0
in the annual Cardinal-White scrimmage at Stan
ford Stadium.
Even the most avid Stanford fans must have been
surprised by what they saw in this game, which
marked the end of spring practice for the Cardinal
gridders. Not only were there many new faces on
the field, but the game was highlighted by some
thing Stanford fans are not accustomed to seeing —
defense.
Both the White and the Cardinal teams started
off sluggishly on offense, punting or turning the ball
over on each of their first three possessions. The
Cardinal team, composed primarily of the starters,
did not mount any kind of a threat until midway
through the first period.
Appropriately enough for this day, that threat
was triggered by the defense. Cardinal outside
linebacker Mike Noble stepped in front of a pass by
White quarterback Greg Ennis and took off down
the sideline to the White 22-yard line, where Ennis
himself saved a touchdown by knocking Noble out
of bounds.
Despite Noble's efforts, the offense could not
capitalize on the excellent field position. On third
and-14. Cardinal quarterback John Paye lofted a
pass to Kevin Scott in the end zone, but the ball was
long and Scott couldn't pull it in. On fourth down,
David Sweeney came on to try a 35-yard field goal.
Sweeney, who has had a rough spring, shanked the
kick left. The Cardinal offense got a reprieve,
however, when White defender Darron Bennett hit
Sweeney after the kick . Bennett was called for a
personal foul, giving the Cardinal squad a first

down on the White 12-yard line.
Once again, the offense could not break through
for the score. Scott and fullback Marshall Dillard
pushed the ball down to the 3-yard line, but on
third and goal, Paye threw errantly again. Sweeney
returned for another try, this time converting from
20 yards out to put the Cardinal squad on top 3-0.
Many people who associate Stanford football
with wide open, unstoppable offense were
surprised by the sluggish Cardinal. Tailback Brad
Muster, who sat out much of the game with a pain
ful jammed toe, had a simple explanation.
"I feel that we were plain lazy on offense in the
first half," he said.
In the second quarter, the Cardinal offense got
on track. Kevin Scott popped up the middle for a
16-yard gain. Paye then found tight end Eric Snel
son over the middle for another 14 yards. Once
again the drive stalled, but the Cardinal defense
was able to maintain the good field position.
On the ensuing possession, Paye took the snap,
sprinted left and then flipped the ball to Scott, who
coasted 11 yards into the end zone. Sweeney
missed the point after, and the score stood at 9-0.
For long-time Stanford watchers, the option that
Paye ran was definitly a new wrinkle. To Stanford
fans, the option is mainly a defensive headache that
has to be dealt with when the team plays Oklahoma
or Texas. According to Paye, followers of the Card
inal should expect to see that type of football a lot
more.
"I like the option a lot," Paye said after the
game. "When we ran it correctly, it scored. It gives
us a new dimension inside the 30-yard line. I think
it will be a good goal line play."
It was midway through the second quarter when
the Thomas Henley show started. Henley, who
moved from tailback to wide receiver this spring,
had had a lot of doubts about whether he could do
well out there. However, he streaked down the
sideline and pulled in a Paye pass for 41 yards to set
up another Sweeney attempt. Sweeney once again
pulled his kick left, this time from 43 yards out.
At the end of the half, the Cardinal offense was
driving again. Paye hit all of his receivers and

worked the ball down to the White 1-yard line.
Most of the drive's yardage came on a deep out
pattern to Henley that netted 25 yards. The Card
inal coughed up the ball at the one to end the drive.
The first half was all defense, on the part of both
squads. The biggest surprise came from the White
team's collection of redshirt freshmen, particularly
inside linebacker Darron Bennett. The 6-3, 203-
pound freshman led all players with 10 solo tackles.
More importantly, he seemed to be everywhere the
ball was. Bennett and his teammates played tough,
agressive football throughout the game. They made
life particularly miserable for the quarterbacks,
dumping Paye six times and forcing him out of the
pocket on several other occasions.
With the defense so far ahead of the offense, one
might think that Stanford Coach Jack Elway would
be nervous about his team's balance. But Elway
gainsays that notion.
"Having the defense ahead has really been a
plus. They've played aggressively and made the of
fense work," he said.
Elway seems to have alleviated the lack of defen
sive depth that plagued the team last year. In addi
tion to Bennett, Lester Archambeau, another red
shirt freshman, seems to have assured himself a
starting spot at defensive tackle. The 6-5, 235-
pounder virtually negated any play that was run at
him.
Add Mike Noble and Dave Wyman, who were
both sidelined with injuries last season, and you've
got the makings for an outstanding defense. The
presence of Wyman — widely considered to a top
pro prospect — has been a particular boost to his
teammates.
In the second half, Paye rallied his team for three
touchdowns. Paye hit Henley over the middle, and
then Henley the running back took over. After the
catch, he broke one tackle, spun right and ran to
the sideline, where he turned on the speed and
dashed 75 yards for a score. Paye and Henley
hooked up again a few minutes later on a 27-yard
touchdown strike that ran the score to 23-0.

Linebacker Dave Wyman (92) may have been on his knees here, but he
stood tall for the Cardinal defense throughout Saturday's Cardinal-
White scrimmage game. But Wyman. coming back from a knee injury
that kept him out of action last season, was only one of many standouts
in a game highlighted by tough defense.
In the fourth quarter, fullback Dil
lard, finding a a big hole on the left
side, trotted in for a 14-yard score.
With the score 30-0 and 8:54 remain
ing in the game, Elway called it quits.
I he team quickly huddled at the cen
ter of the field and broke the huddle
with the cheer " Rose Bowl!"
In addition to the efforts of his
defense, Elway also had to be pleased
with Henley's performance. Henley
ended the day with seven catches for
206 yards and two touchdowns, but
he said he still has a long way to go.
"I can't say that I was ever uncom
fortable out there today, but I'm not
at the point where I want to be,"
Henley said. "The reads I have to
make are kind of different, and the
patterns are a lot longer."
Paye, who hit 21 of 37 attempts for
'306 yards and two scores, had noth
ing but praise for his new target.
"He (Henley) has great adjustment
to the ball. He can tell if it's going to
tail or be a little long. If it's near him,
he's going to catch it or at least knock
it down," Paye said.
Paye also added that he felt that
the whole offense had to be "shaken
up" in order to score. "Despite 30
points, we basically sputtered on of
fense and did not play consistently
during each possession."
With the addition of Henley to the
receiving corps, Stanford has a
legitimate deep threat that it did not
have when Jeff James was drawing
double coverage throughout last
season. The running game looks bet
ter than last year, with all of the
starters returning. By the time the
regular season kicks off in the fall, the
offense will likely develop the bal
ance that Elway stresses above all
else.
Defensively, the addition of many
talented redshirts to a good group of
experienced veterans should make
Stanford's defense a formidable unit,
leading many observers to feel that
1986 could be a bowl year for the
team.
Stanford opens the regular season
on the road, traveling to Austin,
Texas on Sept. 13 to take on the
University of Texas before a crowd
that is traditionally one of college
football's most hostile. The Cardinal
then returns to the friendly environs
of Stanford Stadium for its home
opener against San Jose State on
Sept. 20.

Thomas Henley (20) pulled in this pass and six others on his way to a 206-yard, two-touchdown performance
in Saturday's Cardinal-White scrimmage at Stanford Stadium. Henley converted from running back to wide
receiver at the beginning of spring practice, and his showing on Saturday made believers of everybody except
possibly Henley himself. "I'm not at the point where I want to be," Henley said of his peformance. "The reads
I have to make are different, and the patterns are a lot longer." Both Henley and Jeff James (3) will be run
ning those long patterns this fall, adding a much-needed deep threat to the Cardinal passing game.
