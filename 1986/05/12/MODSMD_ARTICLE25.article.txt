# High jumper, runners excel at S& W Invite
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
At the S&W Modesto Invita
tional Track and Field Meet Satur
day, things didn't come out quite
as they were expected to.
Olympic sprint champion Carl
Lewis lost to a veteran by the
name of Harvey Glance, and the
Stanford track team did surpris
ingly well for a competition that
didn't count.
Going into the meet, Stanford
Coach Brooks Johnson called it a
"filler" — one last chance to com
pete before the Pacific -10 Confer
ence Championships. The meet
didn't count for anything, so
Johnson wasn't expecting a whole
lot. But as it turned out, the Card
inal delivered quite a bit.
The competition marked the
return to form of sophomore high
jumper Brian Marshall. So far this
season, Marshall has been
troubled by a combination of in
juries and a lack of confidence.
After being injured throughout
the indoor season, Marshall has
spent the outdoor season trying to
regain the spring which took him
to an eleventh place finish at last
year's NCAAs.
"He's always had the technique;
the spring just wasn't there," Stan
ford Asst. Coach Dave Wollman
said.
But yesterday at Modesto,
everything seemed to come to
gether for Marshall. After tying
his personal best with a leap of 7-
3 Vi, Marshall barely missed at 7-
5, with his heel just nipping the
bar. The first jump qualified Mar
shall for the NCAAs and the
second one showed what could be
coming in the future.
"He's ready to go very high,"
Wollman said."Seven-five was so
easy, he doesn't even know how
high he can go, which is the nicest
place to be.
"He'll have great confidence
going into the conference meet.
He's jumping high at the right

time," he said.
While Marshall was clearing the
heights, a trio of Cardinal distance
runners managed to conquer some
tough competition.
Beaten only by American
recordholder Henry Marsh, senior
Ryan Stoll placed second in the in
vitational 3,000 meter
steeplechase. Senior Jeff Atkinson
placed second in the invitational
mile with a time of 3:59.9, and
sophomore Christian Skoog won
the open 800 in 1:48.25, a time
which would have given him
second in the invitational 800.
Atkinson had planned to run
the 1,500 to qualify for the
NCAAs, but after comparing the
fields he decided to save himself
for the mile, which featured some
of the country's best-known dis
tance runners.
The pace was slow and by the
final lap victory became a matter
of tactics. Atkinson decided to
forego his usual 300-meter kick
and waited until there was only
100 meters left to make his move.
Unfortunately for Atkinson, In
diana's Terry Brahm went first
and was able to hold him off. At
kinson lost by only two-tenths of a
second.
"It was kind of disappointing. 1
wanted to win, but it was good to
try it (the kick). I'll be looking for
ward to running against him
again," Atkinson said. Atkinson's
chance will most likely come in the
NCAA 1,500 finals.
For Skoog, the win was sweet,
even if he was a little bit disap
pointed by his time. Although the
time was Skoog's personal best, it
was a scant. 14 of a second short of
the NCAA qualifying standard.
"I was pretty happy, but since it
was so close to qualifying, obvi
ously I would've liked to have
been a little faster," Skoog said.
Skoog will now take the next
week to train and get ready for the
conference championships which
will be held May 21-24 at USC.
