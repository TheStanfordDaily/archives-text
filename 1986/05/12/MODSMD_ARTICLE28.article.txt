Afghan rebels reopen supply routes
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Afghan resistance groups have succeeded
in reopening some supply routes that were broken by a Soviet offensive
last month, but guerrilla sources here said last week that the Soviets are
reinforcing major garrisons in eastern Afghanistan, and that a major So
viet drive is believed to be imminent.
The resistance fighters, or mujaheddin, say they are recovering from
the bloody Soviet-backed offensive against Jawar, their major base in
Paktia Province, in which hundreds of their forces were killed and
wounded, and have now reentered Jawar, which the Soviet forces left
after capturing.
Independent analysts agreed that the mujaheddin also inflicted heavy
casualties on the attackers, especially on the initial force' of about 400
Afghan government troops dropped near the base by helicopter.
But the heavy losses suffered by the guerrillas have revived an internal
debate over their military strategy and, in the view of some resistance of
ficials, will lead to a change in tactics.
Afghan government soldiers taken prisoner in the battle are being
forced to clear land mines left by the Soviets around the base, and
several have been killed or wounded, said Mohammed Yaqub Sharafat
of AIP, the resistance-linked Afghan Islamic press agency.
Resistance officials said in interviews last week that many of the
supply trails passing near Jawar were open again, but that a large Soviet
force remained nearby, at the garrison town of Khowst, to the northeast.
In repeated offensives, the Soviets and Afghan government have
failed to open the road or lift the guerrilla siege of Khowst.
Marcos holds Mother's Day rally
HONOLULU — Ferdinand Marcos, the deposed president of the
Philippines, held his first full-scale political rally here yesterday since
leaving his homeland in disgrace.
An estimated 5,000 Filipinos and Filipino-Americans gave Marcos a
standing, cheering ovation as he entered a basketball arena here to sit on
a red velvet throne.
They cheered again as Marcos and his wife, Imelda, stepped to the
microphone to sing an old Filipino love song.
Officially, the event was a Mother's Day tribute to Imelda, the
Philippines' first lady during the 20 years of her husband's rule and a
celebration of the couple's 32nd wedding anniversary.
But in reality — a reality shown by the hundreds of Marcos campaign
T-shirts around the hall — it was the first large-scale gathering of
Marcos' new political organization in exile — the nucleus of a growing
campaign to promote his return to power after his fall to a popular upris
ing in the wake of a corrupt presidential election.
Marcos' amassing of wealth, and Imelda's amassing of art, expensive
clothing and shoes, may have shocked some Filipinos — but not these.
Despite the holiday air of the rally, with vendors hawking cold drinks
and souvenirs, Marcos' political aides, the new government of President
Corazon Aquino and the Reagan administration all took a more serious
view.
The spokesmen for the Aquino regime have said they are angered by
Marcos' escalating political campaign, and State Department officials
say they are annoyed.
Italy vetoes ban on East Bloc food
BRUSSELS, Belgium — The Common Market's on-again, off-again
ban on the import of East bloc food products in the wake of the Cher
nobyl nuclear power plant accident seemed to be off again yesterday.
Although the European Community (Common Market) Commission
announced the ban Saturday, citing a decision of its executive council, an
Italian government spokesman said yesterday that Rome had vetoed the
East Bloc ban when it vetoed radiation-linked limits on food trade
within the Common Market.
While Common Market attorneys said Italy could not block both with
one veto, Rome insisted on linking the two.
Italy fears its vegetable exports would be jeopardized by what it con
siders excessively high minimum radiation levels. Italy favors a 1,000-
becquerel standard, while West Germany wants a 250-becquerel stan
dard.
The import ban would cover fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and dairy
products from the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
Dutch Common Market officials said the import ban and the internal
trade proposal would both be discussed when Common Market foreign
ministers meet today in Brussels.
Syria expels three British diplomats
LONDON — Less than 24 hours after Britain ordered three Syrian
diplomats out of the country because of alleged terrorist activities, Syria
yesterday responded by expelling three British diplomats serving in
Damascus. British officials here immediately condemned the move as
"unjustified and regrettable."
The expulsions — of the embassy's defense attache, a first secretary
and a vice consul — were announced by Damascus radio and subse
quently confirmed by the British Foreign Office.
Britain took action against the three Syrian envoys Saturday after
police investigations linked them with an attempt last month to blow up
an El Al Israel Airline jumbo jet on April 17.
The Syrians have been given a week to leave Britain, the same length
of time given to the British diplomats by Syria.
Although protesting the decision, British Foreign Office officials said
it planned no further action against Syria in the affair.
The Foreign Office spokesman said it had no evidence that a fourth
Syrian diplomat, who left for Damascus on yesterday, was connected
with terrorist activities.
London Metropolitan Police reportedly linked the three Syrians to the
El Al bomb plot at some point late last month, roughly two weeks after
arresting a 31-year-old Palestinian. Nezar Hindawi, in connection with
the same incident.
They were ordered to leave Britain after Syria refused to waive their
diplomatic immunity and let them face possible prosecution.
Spain may break ties with Libya
MADRID. Spain — Government sources said here yesterday that
Spain was on the verge of breaking off diplomatic relations with Libya
following indications that Moammar Khadafy's regime was financing
terrorist activities on Spanish soil.
Sources said a decision would be taken in the next few days. It follows
the arrest Saturday of 10 persons suspected of being members of an in
ternational terrorist group that calls itself "The Call of Jesus Christ."
Two have allegedly admitted the organization's commando group in
Spain was receiving cash backing and instructions from the Libyan Em
bassy in Madrid.
Foreign Minister Fernandez Ordonez described Spain's relations with
Libya as being in "a delicate phase. He has ordered the Spanish Em
bassy in Tripoli to convey Madrid's disapproval for Libya's "irregular
activities."
Neither he nor government spokesman Javier Solana ruled out a
break with Libya. Government sources said much would depend on
whether further details emerge of a Libyan involvement in terrorist ac
tivities in Spain and how Khadafy's regime reacts.
The commando group, which included three Lebanese, a Jordanian, a
Syrian, four Spaniards and a Portuguese, were intent on destroying U.S.
property in Spain, the interior ministry said.
