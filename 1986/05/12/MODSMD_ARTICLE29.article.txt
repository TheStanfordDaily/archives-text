# Soviets say crisis has passed
## 
### 
MOSCOW — A senior Soviet
scientist admitted yesterday that the
Chernobyl disaster was potentially
catastrophic but insisted that the dan
ger has passed in what has been writ
ten into history as the world's worst
nuclear accident.
"Theoretically, until today, there
existed the possibility of a
catastrophe because a large amount
of fuel and reactor graphite remained
in an overheated condition," said
Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of
the Soviet Academy of Scientists and
head of the Soviet commission inves
tigating the disaster.
"Now that possibility is no more,"
Velikhov added, describing yesterday
as a turning point. He said the reactor
eventually would be put back into op
eration, once it was safe to do so.
He said there no longer was any
danger of a further explosion or a
total meltdown of the reactor as some
Western experts had feared.
Velikhov made the comments in
Kiev, 60 miles south of Chernobyl, as
Soviet citizens — and the rest of the
world — were given the most detailed
look at the disaster site. It appeared

on Soviet television screens yesterday
as a ghost town.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
continued his silence on Chernobyl,

causing Western diplomats to spec
ulate on why he had decided to
remain mute during the greatest
domestic crisis in his 14-month ten

ure as General Secretary of the Com
munist Party.
But Soviet sources said that it was
quite normal for a Soviet leader to
defer any statement until a crisis was
brought under control rather than
risk the spread of panic by speaking
out earlier.
Western diplomats have said that
Gorbachev has lost credibility in
Western Europe by not providing
more information more promptly
about the Chernobyl disaster.
Soviet TV viewers yesterday saw
the first film from inside the closed
Chernobyl "danger zone/' a radius of
19 miles around the stricken nuclear
plant.
They saw abandoned main streets,
traffic police wearing gas masks and a
government task force that the an
nouncer said was working a 19-hour
days to deal with the consequences of
the tragedy.
The film, partly shot from inside a
television journalist's car, gave the
most complete picture to date of what
is happening inside the evacuated
zone and at the headquarters of the
Chernobyl disaster relief effort.
