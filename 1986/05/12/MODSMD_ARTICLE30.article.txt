# Warning system could erode

WASHINGTON — U.S. early-warning
coverage of Soviet long-range nuclear missiles
could erode slightly if the first of a new generation
of satellites remains grounded until the end of the
year because of Titan missile explosions, according
to congressional and administration sources.
A constellation of three Defense Support Pro
gram (DSP) satellites, in fixed orbit 20,000 miles
above the Soviet Union, now provides the first
warning of a Soviet missile launch. The satellites'
infrared sensors detect heat from rocket firings on
Earth and quickly relay that information to U.S.
ground stations.
The current DSP satellites are running out of
electricity and are less capable than successors
being built. Failure to begin replacing them could
mean the early-warning network is "less than
ideal" but does not jeopardize the ability to detect
a Soviet missile attack, one source said.
The first replacement was delivered earlier this

year to the Air Force, which intended to launch it
atop a Titan 34D rocket. The launch was delayed
while the Air Force tried to determine the cause of
a Titan 34D explosion at Vandenberg Air Force
Base last August, and then delayed again after a
second Titan blew up last month.
The new generation of DSP satellites is needed
"to replace those that have failed, worn out or are
unable to meet the growing threat," according to
congressional testimony by the Air Force two years
ago.
The new breed is intended to have longer opera
tional life, greater resistance to nuclear radiation
from Soviet anti-satellite weapons and to be resis
tant to electronic jamming while sending data to
other satellites and to ground stations.
Experts on the U.S. early-warning satellites said
an "ideal" system means having three operating
DSP satellites and one reserve in orbit. The three
give not only redundant early-warning data but
also work together to pinpoint the infrared plume

of a missile launch.
In general, the recent epidemic of U.S. space
failures — including the destruction of two Titans,
a Delta rocket and the shuttle Challenger and loss
of its crew of seven — has not yet put the Defense
Department "in dire straits," one official said
recently.
More than 40 U.S. military satellites in nine sys
tems are in space, according to Pentagon sources.
With the exception of U.S. photo-intelligence ca
pabilities, jolted by the loss of two satellites in the
last eight months, "we are not unhealthy," one offi
cial said. That could change, however, if the Titans
and space shuttles cannot be launched again next
year, sources said.
Two major new space-based systems face delays.
Comprised of "Navstar" and "Milstar" satellites,
they are to provide navigation, targeting, nuclear
explosion location and communications services in
the next decade.
