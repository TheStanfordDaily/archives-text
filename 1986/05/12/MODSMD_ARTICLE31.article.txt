Commission sets blame
WASHINGTON — The presidential commis
sion investigating the Jan. 28 Challenger disaster
has concluded that the lowermost bulkhead in
the vehicle's 154-foot-tall external fuel tank blew
out, adding a mighty surge to the space shuttle's
upward thrust a split second before it was envel
oped in a fireball.
The surge, produced by the sudden massive
venting of hydrogen from the ruptured tank, and
the previously reported leak from the right solid
fuel rocket booster, caused the damaged rocket
to pivot, breaking off Challenger's wing. The
rocket then crashed into the fu M tank, rupturing
the separate sections that contained liquid
oxygen and liquid hydrogen and creating the
fireball that appeared from the ground to have
been a violent explosion.
Their report, due to reach President Reagan
on June 6, sources said, will blame the disaster on
the design of the solid rocket booster, the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration's
failure to heed repeated warnings of disastrous
consequences and a breakdown of the system de
signed to assure flight safety.
Senator rips Pentagon
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department
is jeopardizing the independence of a proposed
"Star Wars" think tank by inviting only select sci
entists to establish it and by insisting on a voice in

choosing senior personnel. Sen. Carl Levin (D-
Mich.) said last week.
Levin also said that the Pentagon is creating
"enormous potential for abuse" by refusing to
enact "revolving door" prohibitions against sci
entists moving from the institute to private com
panies whose performance the institute will eval
uate.
The Pentagon announced in March that it in
tends to create a government-funded, non-profit
institute to provide advice on the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI), similar to the way the
Rand Corporation advises the Air Force.
SDI, also known as Star Wars, is President
Reagan's $3-billion-a-year research program
aimed at developing a defense against nuclear
missiles.
The think tank proposal drew criticism from
opponents of the controversial SDI program,
who said creation of an institute will make it
more difficult for future presidents to end or
diminish the SDI program if it proves unwise.
They also said the institute will allow Lt. Gen.
James Abrahamson, SDI director, effectively to
increase the size of his staff at higher-than
government salaries.
Treaties could be costly
WASHINGTON — The State Department es
timates that it would cost $40 million annually
and require 1,300 permanent observers to ensure
compliance with any Central American peace

treaty, according to a recent analysis.
Such an arrangement, which the department
said would cost $9.2 million to establish, is ex
pected to be proposed by U.S. allies in the region
during the next three weeks as part of the final
Contadora-pact negotiations. Negotiators hope
to finish by June 6.
Nicaragua agreed to sign a September 1984
version of the treaty, which others, at the urging
of the United States, condemned as lacking an
adequate verification system.
Nicaragua has pledged to sign the latest draft if
the United States agrees to halt its aid to the
rebels — known as contras or counter
revolutionaries — attacking Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government. Philip Habib has pledged
that U.S. military aid to the contras will cease if
Nicaragua signs the final Contadora treaty and
abides by it thereafter.
Donahue tackles issue
NEW YORK — Talk show host Phil Donahue
and a pro-nuclear activist affliated with political
extremist Lyndon Laßouche got into a fight at an
airport yesterday after the protester shouted that
Donahue and his wife "ought to be murdered,"
officials said.
"The fists were flying," Port Authority Police
Officer Mitchell Kaufman said. "Several officers
responded, and they had to pull them apart."
Donahue's face was bruised and the other man
was taken away in handcuffs after the fight.
