Missouri sails for yard
SAN FRANCISCO — Newly recommissioned
in a traditional, rousing U.S. Navy ceremony, the
San Francisco-based battleship USS Missouri
sails for Long Beach today for completion of yard
work before training and sea trials.
The 58,000-ton nuclear-capable dreadnaught,
spotless after a week of polish and scrubdown.
was welcomed back into the front ranks of the
Navy's ships-of-the-line Saturday before a
dockside audience of some 10.000 people. A few
dozen people, ashore and afloat, protested, but
there were no arrests.
With the words, "By the authority vested in
me," Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger at
11:48 a.m. pronounced the 887-foot battle
wagon officially back in the lists of what the ad
ministration plans to be a 600-ship Navy.
The 42-year-old Missouri, which last saw ac
tion in the Korean War, was the scene of the end
of World War II on Sept. 2. 1945, with the sign
ing of surrender papers by the Japanese in Tokyo
Bay. It was mothballed in 1955.
Weinberger called the recommissioning of the
Missouri "a day to celebrate the rebirth of Amer
ican sea power after years of dangerous neglect"

and said it marks "one of the great satisfactions
of my tenure."
The ship, modernized at a cost of $475 million,
will return for permanent basing at Treasure Is
land in San Francisco Bay in late 1988 or 1989.
Navy systems being sold
SACRAMENTO — A Northern California
company is advertising overseas to try to sell so
phisticated aerial spray systems that can be used
for chemical or biological warfare, a newspaper
reported yesterday.
I he Navy says it mistakenly sold the four Aero
1 4-A systems in 1982 and has tried to get them
back, but a dispute over the price held up a deal,
the Sacramento Bee said.
The Bee said Aero Union Corp. of Chico,
about 80 miles north of Sacramento, paid $976
for the four systems and eight additional compo
nents at a surplus equipment sale at El Toro
Marine Air Station in Southern California in
1982. A prospectus said the equipment cost the
government more than $ 108,000.
A consultant to the company at the time, Arnie
Adams, said he recommended buying the Aero

14-A systems because they had adjustable
nozzles. He said he thought the nozzles could be
copied or modified and sold to companies to
spray pesticides or detergents.
Adams said the Marine Corps used the systems
to spray insecticides to combat malaria-carrying
mosquitoes, but Jack McGeorge, head of the In
stitute for Public Safety, a military consulting
agency, told the Bee that the sprayers were "built
for one thing and one thing only: to apply biolog
ical and chemical weapons."
About a month after Aero Union bought the
sprayers, the Navy notified the company that the
systems had been sold by mistake. Aero Union
offered to return the equipment if the military
would reimburse it for its expenses: $47,700.
Weather to answer
Mostly sunny and mild today with highs 65 to
75. West winds to 20 mph during the afternoon.
Fair tonight with lows from the 40s to the mid
50s. Highs tomorrow in the upper 60s and 70s,
The first year staff is not intimidated by crank
phone calls or unordered pizzas but the Haagen-
Dazs was appreciated.
