Round I results in the Housing Draw, released today.
revealed unusually low cut off numbers for many Univer
sity residences.
As usual. Storey House required the lowest draw num
ber (30 for males and 382 for females) of any campus
residence.
In addition to Storey House, the most popular
residences were 558 Mayfield (87 male and 210 female),
followed by Tovon and Roble.
A draw number of 463 for males and 689 for females
guaranteed entrance into Roble Hall, almost 500 less than
last year's figure. Toyon Hall had a cut-off of 183 for men
and 495 for women, a decrease of about 300.
Yost, originally slated to be a Latin American/Iberian
focus house before student complaints forced the cancel
lation of the program, had cut-off numbers of 567 for men
and 667 for women.
Other residences with unexpectedly low cut-offs in
cluded ATO (881 male and female), Eucalypto (711 men
and 1526 women) and Granada (700 men and 1,669
women).
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Housing Center, said, "The Draw went
very smoothly. It almost always runs without any prob
lem." Questions regarding assignment should be ad
dressed to officials at either resident offices or the
Housing Center, he said.
According to Whitney, the usual number of students
participated in the Draw, and 3,100 spaces were assigned
in the first round.
Whitney said he was surprised by the low cut-off num
bers for guarenteed men. Compared to last year's figure
of 2,949, 3,001 men in the guaranteed pool were assigned
housing this year, he said.

For women the 3,333 average cut-off number for First
round housing assignment was lower than average. Ac
cording to Whitney, the housing situation has worsened
for the females since 1984-85 when they would have been
assigned housing during theii unguaranteed year with a
Draw number of 4,046.
Whitney attributed the low numbers to the new Draw
procedures initiated last year. Under the new system, stu
dents guaranteed campus housing draw from a pool con
taining lower numbers than unguaranteed students. Previ
ously, both guaranteed and unguaranteed students drew
from the same pool.
Assigned students have until Thursday to accept their
assignment or drop out of the Draw, Whitney said. Stu
dents who have decided to live off-campus next year
should also drop out.
Students who do nothing regarding their assignment
will automatically be placed in Round II of the Draw.
Whitney stressed that students can only improve on their
initial assignment by entering Round 11.
Between rounds, all resident assistants and fraternity
pledges as well as students who have accepted their first
round assignments will be removed from the Draw. The
Housing Office will be able to "reassign with the as
surance that those already assigned will not do any
worse." Whitney said.
Cautioning students against jumping to conclusions
concerning their first round assignments, Whitney said no
assignment is official until a residence agreement is
signed.
According to Whitney, priorities that were not obtained
for residences listed by students on their draw cards can
still be earned between Rounds I and 11. Priorities give
students a better chance at getting into priority housing.
Whitney said the results of Round II will be announced
around May 22.
