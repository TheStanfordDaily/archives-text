A proposal for the New Children's Hospital (NCH) at
Stanford will be considered for the first time by University
trustees as they meet in committees today.
The proposed hospital would replace the Children's
Hospital at Stanford, which would then be converted and
used for another purpose.
"No one knows what will happen to the hospital we
have now," said Bob Freelen. vice president for Public
Affairs.
On April 17, two agreements were made between the
University. NCH, Children's Hospital at Stanford and
Stanford University Hospital establishing the affiliation of
the NCH with the University and authorizing the Univer
sity president and the vice president for Business and
Finance to take actions leading to construction of the new

hospital.
The board is expected to authorize the execution of the
terms of these two agreements.
The trustee's Special Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (SCI R) will be considering the recommen
dations of the Commission on Investment Responsibility
(C-IRi to divest more than $4 million from two compan
ies that do business in South Africa.
The C-IR. an advisory committee of students, faculty,
staff and alumni, called for complete divestment from
Diamond Shamrock Petroleum and Schumberger Corpo
ration last week.
The SCI R is also scheduled to hear three students pres
ent the case for divestment of all University funds from
South Africa-related stock.
