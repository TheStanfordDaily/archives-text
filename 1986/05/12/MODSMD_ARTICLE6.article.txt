Stanford's crusade to make

ment and post-graduation career
decisions has scored another vic
tory.
Last Friday, the Public Service
Center (located at Owen House)
hosted a reception to honor the
recipients of Stanford's most sought
after public service awards â€” the

Gardner Fellowships, the Stanford -
In-Government Fellowships and
the Public Service Center Summer
Fellowships.
Although each program is set up
in a unique fashion, they all adhere
to a common objective: to provide
students with the opportunity to
enjoy meaningful work in public
service.
In attendance at the reception
was Stanford President Donald
Kennedy, who congratulated the
recipients from the steps of Owen
House.
"These three programs have now

evolved into very carefully selected
and constructed opportunities. You
people have displayed concern for
others and the desire to improve
the society that you live in," Ken
nedy said.
The Gardner Fellowship pro
gram awards three seniors from
Stanford and three from UC-
Berkeley the opportunity to spend
up to a year with a mentor of their
choice in public service anywhere in
the country.
In its second year, the fellowship
program awards stipends to
graduating seniors who show demon
strated potential for careers in public
service. Stanford's 1986 recipients
are Donna Anderson, Liz Butler and
Troy Eid.
The Fellowship, made possible by
funding from the Walter and Elise
Haas Fund, honors John Gardner, an

way to wet my
feet. Hopefully,
some decisions for
the future will
come out of (this
SIG Fellowship)."

alumnus of both Stanford and
Berkeley. He founded the White
House Fellowship Program and Com
mon Cause, a Washington-based lob
bying organization.
Gardner Fellows are selected by a
committee made up of Stanford fac
ulty and staff. Jim Sweeney, a profes
sor of economics here, serves as
chairman of the selection committee.
"It was inspiring as chairman to see
the quality of involvement that we
have among undergraduate students.
Each recipient demonstrated a com
mittment to public service that went
well beyond the benefits to them
selves," he said.

In addition, Sweeney said he
believes the program will serve as an
invaluable opportunity for the
recipients.
"I think we will give this gang a
chance to enlarge their careers in a
way that they never would have
otherwise," he commented.
Anderson, a political science major
with an emphasis in ethnic and

feminist studies, said she hopes to
work next year for a black woman in
public office in California.
"I want to be working with an indi
vidual who focuses on ethnic issues,
women's issues and urban policy,"
Anderson said.
While at Stanford, Anderson
combined her academic work with
her interest in politics in her positions
as BSU treasurer and ASSU Senate
deputy chair.
In addition, Anderson spent two
summers working with the California
State Assembly in Sacramento. After
her year with the Gardner Fellow
ship, Anderson plans to do graduate

work in public policy at Berkeley.
Anderson said she "definitely"
plans to seek public office sometime
after that.
The Stanford-In-Government
(SIG) Fellowship program is organ
ized differently from the Gardner
Fellowship program.
Applicants for the SIG Fellowships
apply to one of five pre-arranged
government-related interships, in
cluding an opportunity to work in the
office of Senator Edward Kennedy.
Fellowship recipient Samira
Kawash, a senior, will be a staffer
with the United States Trade Repre
sentative Office, working on trade is
sues such as the proposed free trade
agreement with Canada.
Kawash is majoring in political sci
ence and economics.
"Trade appeared as a marvelous
synthesis between these two disci
plines. I'm looking at this summer as
a way to wet my feet. Hopefully some
decisions for the future will come out
of it," she said.
Kawash said she sees her internship
as an entiy into government service,
where someday she will be able to
follow her interests in international
trade, business and finance.
Stanford sophomore Gary Rosen
will be working as an SIG Fellow with
the House Rules Committee as an as
sistant to an analyst who handles the
political terms of legislation.
"The House Rules Committee is
about as central to the legislative
process in Congress an any place you
could work for," Rosen said.
In addition to the SIG Fellowship,
Rosen was recently named a 1986
Truman Scholar for his outstanding
leadership potential in government
service.
Friday's reception also honored the
24 students who have been selected
as recipients of the Public Service
Fellowships for 1986.
The Summer Fellowship program,

now in its third year, encourages stu
dents to identify a community need at
the local, national or international
level and develop an innovative,
practical project to address that prob
lem.
Distinct from the other two pro
grams, the Summer Fellows are selec
ted on the basis of the projects they
submit as part of their applications.
This year the Summer Fellowship
program received a $500,000 pledge
to support the program. The
endowed program will be named
after Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy upon his retirement as recogni
tion of his commitment to public ser
vice.
Freshman Laura Castleman sub
mitted a proposal to work for Sanctu
ary, a shelter for homeless youth in
Detroit. She will help the shelter
coordinate group therapy sessions
and develop a pamphlet on indepen
dent living skills for "throw-away"
children.
"It (Sanctuary) merges my interest
in kids with some of the most devas
tating social issues of our time, (in)
which I am equally interested. If a
few people get involved on a small
scale, you can begin to tackle these is
sues," Castleman said.
Castleman was encouraged by her
resident fellow to apply after he
learned of her interest in public ser
vice. She admitted that the Summer
Fellowship was a good motivator for
her.
"I don't think otherwise I would
have put form to the idea," she said.
Seattle is the site of another Sum
mer Fellowship project.
Stanford senior Jennifer Ruckel
shaus will work in the law offices of
the Seattle Public Defender Associa
tion researching the inmates in the
city's new adult jail and juvenile
detention facility.
Ruckelshaus cited such problems
as lack of adequate space and time for

inmates to meet with attorneys as de
manding immediate attention.
"Inmates are complaining that
their constitutional rights aren't being
upheld," Ruckelshaus said.
During her stay there this summer
Ruckelshaus will be designing an in
terview facility for the adult center as
well as formulating standards by
which the juvenile facility's effective-

ness can be measured.
"This (Summer Fellowship) made
it possible. It would have been hard
to do otherwise," Ruckelshaus said.
Another item on Ruckelshaus'
agenda this summer is the publication
of a book she co-authored with two
other Stanford students.
The book is intended to educate
readers about hunger in the United
States and the Third World as well as
suggest possible alternatives for ac
tion to ameliorate the ever-increasing
problem.
Steve Silverman, a student at the
Law School, will be using his Summer
Fellowship to travel halfway around

the world to South Africa where he
will work as a legal assistant for a
public interest law firm. He will con
centrate on issues relating to human
rights.
This summer won't be Silverman's
first trip to South Africa. Last fall he
had the opportunity to go there and
work on similar issues with a program
organized through the Law School.

Ruckelshaus said
she will use her
award to work for
the Seattle Public
Defenders Associ
ation. "This fel
lowship made that
possible," she
said.

Eventually, Silverman said he
hopes to work for the U.S. State De
partment on issues relating to South
Africa and that region in general.
The large number of students in
volved in public service here is an en
couraging sign, according to Ken
nedy.
"I firmly believe that at the end of
your fellowships, each of you will find
your lives enriched," Kennedy com
mented in his closing remarks.
"My wish for you is that this is just
the beginning of a lifelong commit
ment to public service and commu
nity."
