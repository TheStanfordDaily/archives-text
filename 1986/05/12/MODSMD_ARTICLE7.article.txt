# Grateful Dead visit Frost
## 
### ROBERT REID 
For the second consecutive year, the Grateful Dead
played for two sell-out crowds at Frost Ampitheater this
weekend.
Pat O'Hara, director of the Concert Network, said "this
year it was relatively easy" to book the shows. He added
that negotiations with the University and Bill Graham
Presents, who promoted the shows with the Concert Net
work, went very smoothly.
He said the Concert Network would like to make the
shows "an annual event."
Brian Auger, who oversees operations at all Grateful
Dead shows, said he enjoys producing shows at Frost.
"It's very pleasant, and the staff here is very profes
sional."
"We wish we did more shows here," he said, adding
that the members of the band especially enjoy performing
at Frost.
According to Stanford Police Sergeant Nick Brunot,
who was in charge of security for the concerts,
"Everything went fine. It was no problem at all."
Brunot said five concert-related arrests were made over
the weekend. All of them pertained to drugs, he said, add
ing that none of them were extremely serious in nature.
Police handled "about 15 cases" during last years Dead
weekend, according to Sergeant Del Bandy.

The Dead have a longstanding tradition in the Stanford
Area. In their earliest days, they were closely associated
with Ken Kesey, author of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo s
Nest," who had recently finished a creative writing fellow
ship at Stanford.
The Dead have played at Stanford several times in their
21-year history. This weekend's shows were the fourth set
of concerts that the band has done at Frost, according to
Concert Network Advisor Suzanne Becker. The Dead
also did a performance on the Tresidder Union patio
about 10 years ago, she said.
The Grateful Dead tradition at Stanford remains strong
today. Concert Network Director Pat O'Hara said that
approximately 3,000 Dead tickets were sold to Stanford
students, faculty and staff for the two shows.
Linda Christie, a senior and veteran of 32 Dead shows
said that her favorite shows have been at Frost. Frost is
ideal for Dead shows because "it's outside, it's warm and
it's not confining," she said.
Many people at the show said they had driven hundreds
and, in some cases, thousands of miles to see the Frost
shows. Mike McGoldrick, a long-time fan from Chicago's
South Side, remarked that both shows were "very fine,
and worth every penny."
The natural beauty of the ampitheater, augmented by
warm weather Saturday and Sunday, was frequently given
as the reason why Frost shows are so special.
