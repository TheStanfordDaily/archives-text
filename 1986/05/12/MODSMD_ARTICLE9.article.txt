"AIDS is an international problem, a national problem and it is our prob
lem," President Donald Kennedy told more than 300 guests at his home Satur
day.
We "shouldn't treat it as a kind of Soviet nuclear reactor sinking through
someone else's earth." he said.
The late afternoon reception on the lawn of the Lou Henry Hoover House
kicked off a fund raising benefit which raised nearly $30,000 for AIDS educa
tion and research.
Organizers said it was the first large-scale benefit of its kind at a major uni
versity.
A Memorial Auditorium performance of "Unfinished Business," a play
about AIDS performed throughout the country, capped the evening's pro
gram. Zelda Rubinstein, who is best known for her role as a psychic in
"Poltergeist," starred as the apple-cheeked Mother.
Rubinstein is spearheading the nation's most acclaimed AIDS information
campaign.
Stanford is a prime target for promoting AIDS safety and awareness because
undergraduate and graduate students comprise a high risk group for the
disease, Rubinstein said at the reception.
The campaign, headquartered in Los Angeles, aims at making safe sex
fashionable, according to Mark Manning, campaign organizer.
Rubinstein's message is simple: "By all means play, but play safely."
Some universities have requested information about Stanford's employment
policies and educational outreach programs regarding Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome. Dean James Lyons and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS) are sending information packets to more than 70 universities
across the country.
