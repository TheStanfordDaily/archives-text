# Divestment from two corporations possible
## Board to vote on measure at today's session 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday expressed hope that
the Board of Trustees would vote
today to divest University funds from
Diamond Shamrock Petroleum and
Schumberger Corporation.
"I would hope we see selective di
vestment tomorrow," Kennedy told a
group of students gathered in front of
his home yesterday after trustee com
mittee meetings.
He declined to reveal, however,
what recommendation the trustees'
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility (SCIR) would forward
to the full board.
The board will vote today on the
committee's recommendation.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said he believes divestment is a
strong possibility. "1 think there is a
reasonable chance that [the trustees]
will vote in favor of divestment along
the lines of the recommendations
made by the C-IR (Commission on
Investment Responsibility)," he said
yesterday.
Although the trustees have main
tained that they follow a policy of
selective divestment, an affirmative
decision by the board would mark
Stanford's first divestment in protest
of apartheid.
On May 2, the C-IR recommended
to the SCIR that Stanford completely
divest from Diamond Shamrock and
Schumberger. The University holds
$3.5 million of Stock in Diamond
Shamrock and $454,000 in
Schumbe rger.
Kennedy's remarks came after a
day of committee meetings with Uni
versity trustees and student protests
Sgfunst apartheid when a group of
about 15 students gathered outside
his house around 5 p.m. Originally in
tending to stage another protest, the
students settled for a brief, im
promptu question-and-answer ses
sion with the University president.
A presentation to the SCIR and the
board's Committee on Investments
by four students arguing for total di
vestment from companies doing busi
ness in South Africa was well
received. Kennedy said.
The trustees were responsive to an
"effective and persuasive" presenta
tion, according to Kennedy, but "it
did not change the board's mind on
total divestment in such a way that
the trustees will vote for total divest
ment tomorrow."
The trustees favor selective divest
ment. Kennedy said, because blanket
divestment seems to be a judgment
against the companies and not only
against the apartheid regime of South
Africa.

"I am not prepared to recommend
divestment on a large scale because I
have not seen the positive effects,"
Kennedy said, emphasizing that
selective divestment seemed a fair
and balanced strategy that works to
pressure the South African govern
ment to abolish apartheid without
punishing companies that have
policies designed to benefit blacks.
Under a selective divestment
policy, Stanford would base any deci
sion to divest from a company par
tially on that company's record of re
lations with its black and colored
workers and its adherence to the Sul
livan Principles, a code of behavior by
which companies in South Africa are
rated.
Will Masters, a graduate student at
the Food Research Institute and one
of the four who addressed the trus
tees today, last night accused the trus
tees of worrying more about the fi
nancial impact of divestment on the
University than about the moral and
political impact on South Africa.
"The trustees seem to see a trade
off between the morality of divest

ment and the loss of donations from
the corporations," he said. "They're
scared to divest because they're
afraid it will cost Stanford money and
they don't want to be accused of ham
pering University fund-raising ef
forts."
Trustee John Packard, chairman of
the Committee on Investments, last
night denied that the trustees saw a
trade-off, saying. "Divestment is a
complex issue and the question of
corporation gifts was only one aspect
among many that were discussed."
He noted, however, that the ques
tion was important. "You can't in
good faith accept a gift from a com
pany you divest from,"he said.
"Divesting from a company is basi
cally condemning it. How can you ac
cept financial support from a com
pany you label as immoral?"
Asked if fiduciary responsibility
was a major concern when consider
ing divestment, Kennedy responded
that the morality of divestment and
its effects in abolishing apartheid was
