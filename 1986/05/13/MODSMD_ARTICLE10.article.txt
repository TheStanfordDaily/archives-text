report's conclusion
I appreciated the story (Daily, May
7) on the Judicial Affairs final report
about the cheating in Psychology 1
last spring quarter. The story cor
rectly emphasized one major conclu
sion — that students who study to
gether should not sit near each other
during exams — but it did not provide
the context within which that state
ment makes sense.
The following quotation is from the
final report, copies of which are
available at 323 Old Union.
"Students who study intensively to
gether, who essentially learn all the
course material with others, are likely
to have very similar knowledge in
their heads — including similar false
assumptions, mistaken facts and
misunderstandings. If these students
were then to write term papers or es
say exams independently, their indi
vidual styles would mark their work
in distinctive ways even if the content
was virtually identical.
"Multiple choice tests, however,
leave no room for individual styles
and honest students with similar
knowledge are likely to have similar
scores as well as similar item-for-item
responses. And these similar or
identical outcomes — especially if
they occur over several tests — will
cause reasonable people to question
the honesty of the students involved.
"This poses a dilemma in situations
where good pedagogy would encour
age students to work collaboratively
but test results may later falsely iden
tify them as cheaters.
"On balance, I think that students
should continue to study and learn to
gether: the educational benefits far
outweigh the risks of false accusa

tions. Courses in which all the tests
are entirely multiple choice are
relatively uncommon at Stanford.
And, as occurred in the Psych 1 in
vestigations, there is usually evidence
external to the test answers them
selves that allows one to distinguish
between those whose test outcomes
result from cheating and those who
simply studied and learned together.
To minimize the risk of being falsely
accused of cheating, however,
students who study together should
take care not to sit near each other
during examinations."

Suit by Davies is
framed incorrectly
As a frequent visiting scholar at
Stanford's Center for Research On
Women (CROW) and member of a
nearby history department, I find the
presentation of the Norman Davies
case troubling. I do not refer to the
substantive or procedural issues in
volved, but to other matters brought
before the public so far — statements
made on History Prof. Davies' behalf
by his lawyer, Pete McCloskey.
Davies, according to McCloskey,
heard that "six Jewish professors
stood up and castigated" a chapter in
Davies' book because it "reflected
anti-Semitic leanings." McCloskey
also suggests that Davies "was denied
the appointment because he was al
legedly insensitive to the Zionist view
of the history of Poland." Davies now
says: "I'm not at all certain which of
the rumors are true and untrue," and
that the legal process should deter
mine which.
These several statements bear
looking into. If Davies really thinks
the rumors may be untrue, and if he

wants to challenge the History De
partment's decision, then why did he
not file the suit against the chair of
the department, or the University it
self? Why did he name as primary
defendant Prof. Harold Kahn, who
has no administrative responsibility
for the decision? This choice implies
that Kahn represents those "six
Jewish professors" whom McCloskey
deems responsible for blackballing
Davies.
Twelve members of the History
Department voted against, and 11
for, Davies' appointment. His lawyer
has singled out six Jewish professors
— but why not the six non-Jewish
professors? History professors may or
may not desire an ethnic identifica
tion; it may or may not affect their
view of history. By dividing the de
partment along ethnic lines, by sug
gesting that certain views of history
follow from these lines and that cer
tain views are biased while others are
objective, McCloskey attributes a
consipiracy to six Jewish professors
that he does not attribute to the other
six, or to Davies' 11 supporters.
If the case concerns something else
— something procedural, for instance
— then nothing about the Jewish pro
fessors, or "the Zionist view of the
history of Poland" McCloskey attri
butes to them, should have come up.
At this point, the community is faced
with McCloskey's singling out of Jew
si h professors and suggestions of bias
on their part.

officer stresses
report's conclusion
I appreciated the story (Daily, May
7) on the Judicial Affairs final report
about the cheating in Psychology 1
last spring quarter. The story cor
rectly emphasized one major conclu
sion — that students who study to
gether should not sit near each other
during exams — but it did not provide
the context within which that state
ment makes sense.
The following quotation is from the
final report, copies of which are
available at 323 Old Union.
"Students who study intensively to
gether, who essentially learn all the
course material with others, are likely
to have very similar knowledge in
their heads — including similar false
assumptions, mistaken facts and
misunderstandings. If these students
were then to write term papers or es
say exams independently, their indi
vidual styles would mark their work
in distinctive ways even if the content
was virtually identical.
"Multiple choice tests, however,
leave no room for individual styles
and honest students with similar
knowledge are likely to have similar
scores as well as similar item-for-item
responses. And these similar or
identical outcomes — especially if
they occur over several tests — will
cause reasonable people to question
the honesty of the students involved.
"This poses a dilemma in situations
where good pedagogy would encour
age students to work collaboratively
but test results may later falsely iden
tify them as cheaters.
"On balance, I think that students
should continue to study and learn to
gether: the educational benefits far
outweigh the risks of false accusa

tions. Courses in which all the tests
are entirely multiple choice are
relatively uncommon at Stanford.
And, as occurred in the Psych 1 in
vestigations, there is usually evidence
external to the test answers them
selves that allows one to distinguish
between those whose test outcomes
result from cheating and those who
simply studied and learned together.
To minimize the risk of being falsely
accused of cheating, however,
students who study together should
take care not to sit near each other
during examinations."

Suit by Davies is
framed incorrectly
As a frequent visiting scholar at
Stanford's Center for Research On
Women (CROW) and member of a
nearby history department, I find the
presentation of the Norman Davies
case troubling. I do not refer to the
substantive or procedural issues in
volved, but to other matters brought
before the public so far — statements
made on History Prof. Davies' behalf
by his lawyer, Pete McCloskey.
Davies, according to McCloskey,
heard that "six Jewish professors
stood up and castigated" a chapter in
Davies' book because it "reflected
anti-Semitic leanings." McCloskey
also suggests that Davies "was denied
the appointment because he was al
legedly insensitive to the Zionist view
of the history of Poland." Davies now
says: "I'm not at all certain which of
the rumors are true and untrue," and
that the legal process should deter
mine which.
These several statements bear
looking into. If Davies really thinks
the rumors may be untrue, and if he

wants to challenge the History De
partment's decision, then why did he
not file the suit against the chair of
the department, or the University it
self? Why did he name as primary
defendant Prof. Harold Kahn, who
has no administrative responsibility
for the decision? This choice implies
that Kahn represents those "six
Jewish professors" whom McCloskey
deems responsible for blackballing
Davies.
Twelve members of the History
Department voted against, and 11
for, Davies' appointment. His lawyer
has singled out six Jewish professors
— but why not the six non-Jewish
professors? History professors may or
may not desire an ethnic identifica
tion; it may or may not affect their
view of history. By dividing the de
partment along ethnic lines, by sug
gesting that certain views of history
follow from these lines and that cer
tain views are biased while others are
objective, McCloskey attributes a
consipiracy to six Jewish professors
that he does not attribute to the other
six, or to Davies' 11 supporters.
If the case concerns something else
— something procedural, for instance
— then nothing about the Jewish pro
fessors, or "the Zionist view of the
history of Poland" McCloskey attri
butes to them, should have come up.
At this point, the community is faced
with McCloskey's singling out of Jew
si h professors and suggestions of bias
on their part.
