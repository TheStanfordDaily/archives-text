## Ethnic housing hampers diversity 
### 
Ethnic theme houses on the Stanford campus
should he eliminated from the housing system.
These houses, though noble in intention, have
come to detract from, rather than contribute to, the
diversity of which Stanford is so very proud. An im
mediate reaction to this claim may be that the mat
ter of ethnic theme houses concerns only the few
hundred students housed in these dorms, that these
students are merely exercising an option and that,
therefore, this is not an issue of major concern to
Stanford students. In short, some may say that this

LILY CHANG

is really no big deal. Not true, I say. Beneath the
issue of the worth of ethnic theme houses is a more
pervasive question. Is it the right of students, if they
so choose, to be able to return to a living situation
where the atmosphere is congenial and sympathetic
after having faced the discrimination from the
outside during the day? Or. is it the responsibility
of these minority students, given the opportunity to
make a difference, to seize upon the chance Stan
ford has provided and to help the prejudiced un
derstand?
To the latter question, some may reply that they,
as a minority, should not have to work harder to
gain acceptance, that it is their right to be treated as
a complete equal. Granted that the right is theirs,
the equality obviously is not. Should anyone live in
an isolated environment under the flagship of
"unity" simply because they perceive the outside
world as being hostile or ignorant? I believe that
too many people are working too hard for anyone
to justify this attitude. In other words, it is mv re

sponsibility to live and interact in the real world,
the entire world. When the situation arises such
that discrimination puts up a roadblock, it is
likewise my responsibility to set it aside with expla
nation and example, instead of turning around or
forceably knocking down this obstacle.
Thus far, I have dealt generally with the topic,
but specifically and personally, I, as an Asian
American, have chosen to live, not in Okada, but in
dorms where I have truly been able to contribute to
the diverse potential of Stanford. I believe that I
have helped in promoting cultural activities, raising
the awareness level on issues important to Asians
and all minorities, and changing the incorrect
stereotypes of Asian Americans. I have enjoyed
immensely introducing dim sum, sushi and tradi
tions of family and respect to friends in my dorm.
This to me is more satisfying than visiting
Chinatown with Okada.
When I was a freshman, I believe that I helped
most of my freshman dorm of 60 gain an increased
understanding of Asian life and Asians in the
United States. Discussion of issues such as Taiwan-
U.S. relations and the question of Asian inclusion
in affirmative action gave me the opportunity to
voice my opinion to many who never before heard
an Asian's point of view. Living in Okada. I would
have discussed these topics mostly with other
Asians who had already been exposed to the issues.
Exposure is the key to understanding and progress,
and the ethnic theme houses on campus are not
providing the type of exposure necessary to the
promotion of minority causes.
Growing up in Louisiana enabled me to observe
many a discriminating act toward blacks. This dis
crimination raised numerous questions in my mind

as I grew up, and I often attempted to discuss ques
tions regarding job discrimination, everyday verbal
abuse, the future of the civil rights movement and
others with peers and adults at home. Usually,
though, I came upon stumbling blocks such as em
barrassment and ignorance in my search for
answers. Since coming to Stanford, however, I have
gained many answers and raised even more ques
tions. The attitude on campus toward open discus
sion enabled me to question fellow dorm members
on issues with which they could readily provide
opinions and ideas. 1 often felt, though, that even
more awareness coud be generated, from all
minorities, but especially from the larger black and
hispanic populations. Perhaps this increase can be
brought about through the elimination of the
theme houses. Then, the programming of ethnic
groups can be brought to all students, to students
who most need it, instead of to Okada, Ujamaa and
Casa Zapata.
One look at the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford can tell the doubtful that a non-housed
organization can do great things to promote aware
ness on campus. GLAS members do have a place to
turn for a sympathetic ear and for a social function
free of hassles, but they are also able to fully
respond to the opportunity to promote understand
ing at Stanford. Each of them live and function with
those ready for enlightenment. Each of them has a
complete chance to act upon their responsibility, as
should all members of minority groups, ethnic or
otherwise. Stanford provides a unique chance to
make a difference, and this chance should not be
hampered in any way, even by the option of living
in an ethnic theme house.

Stanford can tell the doubtful that a non-housed
organization can do great things to promote aware
ness on campus. GLAS members do have a place to
turn for a sympathetic ear and for a social function
free of hassles, but they are also able to fully
respond to the opportunity to promote understand
ing at Stanford. Each of them live and function with
those ready for enlightenment. Each of them has a
complete chance to act upon their responsibility, as
should all members of minority groups, ethnic or
otherwise. Stanford provides a unique chance to
make a difference, and this chance should not be
hampered in any way, even by the option of living
in an ethnic theme house.

Ethnic theme houses on the Stanford campus
should he eliminated from the housing system.
These houses, though noble in intention, have
come to detract from, rather than contribute to, the
diversity of which Stanford is so very proud. An im
mediate reaction to this claim may be that the mat
ter of ethnic theme houses concerns only the few
hundred students housed in these dorms, that these
students are merely exercising an option and that,
therefore, this is not an issue of major concern to
Stanford students. In short, some may say that this

is really no big deal. Not true, I say. Beneath the
issue of the worth of ethnic theme houses is a more
pervasive question. Is it the right of students, if they
so choose, to be able to return to a living situation
where the atmosphere is congenial and sympathetic
after having faced the discrimination from the
outside during the day? Or. is it the responsibility
of these minority students, given the opportunity to
make a difference, to seize upon the chance Stan
ford has provided and to help the prejudiced un
derstand?
To the latter question, some may reply that they,
as a minority, should not have to work harder to
gain acceptance, that it is their right to be treated as
a complete equal. Granted that the right is theirs,
the equality obviously is not. Should anyone live in
an isolated environment under the flagship of
"unity" simply because they perceive the outside
world as being hostile or ignorant? I believe that
too many people are working too hard for anyone
to justify this attitude. In other words, it is mv re

sponsibility to live and interact in the real world,
the entire world. When the situation arises such
that discrimination puts up a roadblock, it is
likewise my responsibility to set it aside with expla
nation and example, instead of turning around or
forceably knocking down this obstacle.
Thus far, I have dealt generally with the topic,
but specifically and personally, I, as an Asian
American, have chosen to live, not in Okada, but in
dorms where I have truly been able to contribute to
the diverse potential of Stanford. I believe that I
have helped in promoting cultural activities, raising
the awareness level on issues important to Asians
and all minorities, and changing the incorrect
stereotypes of Asian Americans. I have enjoyed
immensely introducing dim sum, sushi and tradi
tions of family and respect to friends in my dorm.
This to me is more satisfying than visiting
Chinatown with Okada.
When I was a freshman, I believe that I helped
most of my freshman dorm of 60 gain an increased
understanding of Asian life and Asians in the
United States. Discussion of issues such as Taiwan-
U.S. relations and the question of Asian inclusion
in affirmative action gave me the opportunity to
voice my opinion to many who never before heard
an Asian's point of view. Living in Okada. I would
have discussed these topics mostly with other
Asians who had already been exposed to the issues.
Exposure is the key to understanding and progress,
and the ethnic theme houses on campus are not
providing the type of exposure necessary to the
promotion of minority causes.
Growing up in Louisiana enabled me to observe
many a discriminating act toward blacks. This dis
crimination raised numerous questions in my mind

as I grew up, and I often attempted to discuss ques
tions regarding job discrimination, everyday verbal
abuse, the future of the civil rights movement and
others with peers and adults at home. Usually,
though, I came upon stumbling blocks such as em
barrassment and ignorance in my search for
answers. Since coming to Stanford, however, I have
gained many answers and raised even more ques
tions. The attitude on campus toward open discus
sion enabled me to question fellow dorm members
on issues with which they could readily provide
opinions and ideas. 1 often felt, though, that even
more awareness coud be generated, from all
minorities, but especially from the larger black and
hispanic populations. Perhaps this increase can be
brought about through the elimination of the
theme houses. Then, the programming of ethnic
groups can be brought to all students, to students
who most need it, instead of to Okada, Ujamaa and
Casa Zapata.
