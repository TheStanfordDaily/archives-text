# Self-worth not produced
## 
### 
I remember a game we used to play in our junior high
school social studies class. It was called "Survival," or
something like that. The premise of the game was that we,
four or five students who had formed a group, were
shipwrecked somewhere in outer space, with limited re
sources. Oxygen was non-existent on the planet, as were
viable and recognizable forms of food, and what we had
on the ship could support only two, or at most three of us,
until the time when we might be saved. We knew that if
we all shared we would all die; obviously, this was not the
best solution. So we, the group stranded on the planet,
had to decide amongst ourselves who was most likely to
survive under the harsh circumstances, who was most
helpful to the others; and, conversely, who was most, shall
we say, expendable, and finally, who was most likely to
die.

The game was, as one might imagine, not easily
decided. Each person, who had been given random pro
fessions and certain knowledge and characteristics, argued
heatedly for their own worth. Each person tried to con
vince the others that they were most important, that they
could contribute the most to their own and to the others
survival. What was always interesting to me was that one's
worth was tied almost directly to what one could produce.
one's own self-worth was often tied to the very
"same thing, and one's self-identity became inseparable
from what one offered the community. As a group we
argued whether the doctor was more important than the
lawyer, or the trash collector more important than the
physicist, but we rarely discussed things besides skills and
knowledge, such unquantifiable aspects as personality and
experience, though we were given parts of this informa
tion as well. The determining factor, I remember, was al
most always what profession the individual was associated
with, what knowledge the individual had picked up in
school which might help the group survive. We all per
fectly understood what the exercise implied — some
things, some knowledge, some professions are more im
portant than others, and thus the people who contain that
knowledge are more important than those who don't.
Then, as had to happen, some people were declared more
expendable than others, and were eliminated, so a few
could live alone instead of the whole dying together. And
who were we to question the logic of that?
There is little doubt that most people would agree with
the basic conclusion which we took from the game; some
professions, and what they produce, and thus some
people, are more important in a society than others. But
there are numerous by-products of this idea which I find
particularly scary. What happened with us is that we
began to identify ourselves with the profession which we
had chosen, and we saw our success in that profession as
validation of our lives. Our lives were given meaning by
what we could produce, and we were worthwhile human
beings not because of who we were inside but what knowl

edge we had to give. In the game of Survival, we had to
distinguish ourselves from others; and in this competitive
society, anything which we could use, we did. The scary
part, I believe, is how I, and so many of us around here,
have never separated ourselves from these notions. On
some larger scheme of things, we try to prove our worth
by our accomplishments, and then come to believe our
worth and our identity is intimately linked to how impor
tant others perceive our production. Thus, we become so
distraught over poor grades, or refuse to share our work
with others, because these are such intimate reflections of
who we are — our self-identity and self-worth.
In our search to define and understand ourselves, what
we do definitely does and should play a part. But it must
be kept in perspective. We must realize that we and others
are individuals with qualities separate from our profes
sions or our knowledge. I shudder whenever I hear friends
say their main goal in life, what would make them happy
(and give their life meaning), is to end up, somewhere
down the long road, at the top of their profession. Do they
realize how difficult this is, in the first place, and how
devastated their lives will be if they don't reach it?
I am scared to see that I have bought into the produc
tion trap as well, not wanting to define myself or my
happiness by what I am doing or producing, but seeing
that it is an embedded part of my bourgeois mentality. I
know that I can make my own path, and find my happi
ness inside myself, but it is so very difficult to truly believe
it. In a society which needs to keep producing more and
more to sustain itself, people are taught, implicitly or ex
plicitly, that their production is necessary for their own
happiness, that production and "doing" are good, while
slouching off and non-production are evils to be avoided.
And no, I'm not going to bring in a Marxist analysis of
capitalism (though it may be applicable), for I am
eminently unqualified for that. All I'm trying to say is that
since any society grows and expands because its people
keep working, it is materially beneficial to all in the soci
ety to produce, and because different types and quantities
of work are more beneficial to the society than others,
people come to define their own self-worth by how much
they can contribute (and, I suppose, how much they are
paid for their production).
I imagine it's fairly basic for a graduating senior, partic
ularly one with an English degree living in a technological
world, to worry about such things. I still debate with
myself in what profession I might have the most influence,
help the most people and, keeping the game of Survival
somewhere in the back of my mind, have the most worth.
I hate the thought of having to produce something, of
having to be something to validate my life, but yet I do
want people to like and respect me and my work, and the
two seem so intertwined. But the ultimate irony is that I
know, deep inside, that the answer is to separate my own
self-worth from what I produce, and to find my happiness
and self-identity in things which aren't variable and
changeable, and set to be judged by outside observers.
But it will always be a struggle, for the game of Survival,
which taught us something about self-worth in a society
such as ours, lies importantly in my conscience, and my
self-identity is tied, at least to a point, to my production.
But in the end, is this what survival should be like, and
would all of us really consider it living?
