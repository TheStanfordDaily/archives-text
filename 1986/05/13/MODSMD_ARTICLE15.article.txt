# Stanford must act to alleviate students' frustration
## 
### 
On Friday night the tensions really came
out. Four hundred students, faculty and staff
thronged into Cubberley to hear the answers
of the men and women in control, to make a
break with their own powerlessness, to briefly
take control themselves. It was one of the
most disturbing things 1 have seen in my three
years here.

I sat against a back wall and watched the
motions and the rumblings and the risings of
the crowd. This was a crowd like no other
you've seen at a Stanford auditorium. It was a
forum, all right: questions were freely asked
and at least partially answered. I actually
think few had come for real answers; the
problems were too great, too fundamental
and ancient to realistically expect a magic an
swer in two hours at Cubberley. But we really
hoped for something . . . anything.
I hoped for an answer to the students'
powerlessness. I thought that with the bril
liant men and women there — and there truly
were — and with the gravity of the issues we
faced, there would arise something to tell me
where we could go from here, how we could
do something about the things that matter to

us — a master solution to the hundreds of
small and large struggles waged on this
campus.
Others came for retribution. They were
realistic enough to understand there'd be no
answers, and wise enough to know that this
might be the last, or the only, chance they'd
have to strike back. There was a lot of frustra
tion let loose in that room, and it fed on itself
and became viciousness. For one moment
only the frustrated had the powerful in their
hands— alone, outnumbered a hundred to
one — and the people were in the right place
and time to say what had been on their minds
for years. The crowd turned on the adminis
trators at the podium.
I have seen nothing before here at Stanford
like that forum. I know that I could not have
sat on that stage for two hours and continued
to rise to the abuse. But I certainly could not
sit in that audience without being moved by
the depth of the frustration of the hundreds
there — and of the many hundreds more they
must represent throughout the University.
Why is this so? What is so wrong here? Per
sonally, I love Stanford, and it has been won
derful for me; I love my job at the ASSU, just
as the administrators on that stage and else
where may and probably do love their jobs
running the University. The fundamental dif

ference is that if the students were to really
disapprove of me or my work, I would be
gone in a flash. But in the University's
structure, it's quite different.
Beyond the almost negligible range of the
ASSU, students and other community mem
bers have no control whatsoever. This is the
real problem; this is why hundreds came to
vent the build-up of years. How can people
really take control of their lives when:
• Students are the minority on almost every
committee of the University.
• Students on decision-making committees
have no background and no decision-making
capability to defeat the concerted opposition
of faculty and administration.
• The Senate of the Academic Council ac
cepts these committees' recommendations
largely without debate and in virtually closed
session. It takes over nearly all the duties of
the Academic Council, shutting out any
power that the faculty at large once held.
• Staff and faculty have little incentive to take
student initiatives seriously, since 40 percent
— that's right, 40 percent — of the student
body turns over every year.
Why do members of the community spring
at the powerful when they have the chance?
Because even if they're not informed, even if
they don't know the real extent to which

they're excluded, they know by instinct that
the University marches on without a demo
cratic governance.
I understand, as nearly everyone does, that
Stanford is a monstrous institution and cannot
function as a true participatory democracy or
even as much less of a bureaucracy. I under
stand the need for some bureaucracy and
hierarchy; hey, I work for the ASSU. And I
certainly understand the intensity of the com
mitment University President Donald Ken
nedy makes to meeting with people; you
could go from public event to public event
and see Kennedy six times every day, if you so
chose. But we're missing something here.
When 400 people go like a wolf pack after the
administration, something's definitely mis
sing.
A few things.
1. There must be more meetings like this
one — perhaps one every quarter. This would
give everyone the right to question authority
frankly, if not ruthlessly; how many of the
questions addressed Friday would have been
appropriate for one of the president's other
appearances? In any other context, they
would have been quite difficult to ask.
But it's not just the president who should
take part; as has been made painfully clear to
me, Stanford is decentralized. Kennedy may

he ultimately responsible, but to really make
things run, the appropriate administrators are
answerable and therefore must be question
able.
2. Students must support the initiatives of
other students. How many years has the Black
Student Union been fighting a lonely fight
against Western Culture? A long time — but
now the balance is changing, and that is what
will make the difference. Action on student
issues happens when arguments are matched
with numbers.
3. Finally, and most importantly, there
must be some serious thought given to a more
integrated structure of governance. At the
forum there was talk of a student-faculty sen
ate; maybe that's a start. Or maybe the
reasons that idea was rejected are still valid.
Who knows?
One thing we do know is that Stanford is a
trust for education and for benefitting society.
As a private, first-class, well-endowed univer
sity, it's unique among society's institutions. I
think we need to find some unique solutions. I
think we need to think about powerlessness
and frustration — and where we can go from
here.
