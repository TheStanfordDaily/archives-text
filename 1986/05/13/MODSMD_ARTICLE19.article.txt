## BUG ME 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
Alright, last week's column was, admittedly,
worthless and weak. But this week marks what I
think will generally be regarded as a return to the
kind of hard-hitting, issues-oriented, incisive, in
vestigative, Geraldo Rivera-eat-my-shorts
macho journalism that readers have come to ex
pect from Bug Me. People will again be uttering
the words "Pulitzer Prize" in hushed tones
whenever the Bug Me writer enters the office.
Yeah right.
Bug Me Mailbag—
1 received a letter this week from Elly Kamath,
Stanford Class of 1935, who wrote to correct a
column of a month ago in which I stated that the
present Old Union was originally a women's dor
mitory. I'll present her note in its entirety be
cause it offers a really neat glance back at the
Stanford of old, while also providing some in
triguing parallels to the Stanford of today:
The Union was not originally a women's
dorm. It became so only after the 500 limit (on
women's enrollment) was lifted. 1 moved there
from Roble in fall 1933. It was heavenly to have a
single without a roommate. The old Union
(men's clubhouse) was the home of The Cellar,
where we all went on a sit-down when coffee
went from a nickel to a dime. Of course tuition
was only $114 a quarter then and campus
(enrollment) went down to 2,200 students at De
pression bottom."
Dear Bug Me,
Given my recent difficulties in finding a suitable
companion here on campus, / would like to find
out how to become a participant on "Love Con
nection. "
-Name withheld to protect the innocent.
This is the second installment in a series on
dating at Stanford, going along with the much
ballyhooed Dollie question of a couple weeks
ago.
1 talked to Emily, the receptionist at the "Love
Connection" production 'office, and she ex
plained the whole process to me.
First, one must be at least 23 years of age and
single to participate in the "Love Connection." If
you meet those requirements (and not too many
undergrads, it seems, would make the age mini
mum), you should call or write the "Love Con
nection" to set up an appointment for an inter
view. Call (213) 659-6216, or write "The Love
Connection" Production Office, 8601 Beverly
Boulevard Suite 5, Los Angeles, Ca. 90048.
According to Emily, the first step after that is a

group interview, during which the producers of
the show are looking for "very outgoing" people.
Those interviewees judged to be suitably outgo
ing are then invited back to make a videotape of
themselves (the one that is shown on the air if
they are selected to appear on the program.)
Emily said that the office receives about 200
calls a day from prospective "love connectees."
Of those, she said, about 40 percent eventually
appear on the show.
"If they are really outgoing and like to talk
about themselves, chances are very good that
they'll eventually get on the air," she said.

to amaze and mystify your date with your knowl
edge of Western Culture.

Dear Bug Me,
We 're just a bunch of mildew-covered grad stu
dents and post-docs who have been living in a
shoebox for decades, but by golly, we're curious.
Just what exactly does "Pro Fro Bio Cho" mean?
Big money is riding on the answer.
- Some nerdly chemist
Let's see how tastefully this can be done.
This question refers to a "Farm Side" cartoon
(a copy of which was included with this letter)
that appeared in The Daily a couple weeks ago.
The phrase "Pro Fro Bio Cho" finds its origins
in the Stanford undergraduate tradition of reduc
ing many proper nouns and other commonly used
phrases to two-or-three-letter monosyllables.
Perhaps this is done for the sake of being hip
(you know, dude, like saying "rad" for
"radical"); or perhaps this is done to save stu
dents' precious vocal chords for more important
verbal chores like class discussion (hmmmm).
The scariest thing is the scale to which this
practice has grown. The cartoon in question is an
indication: "pro fro" stands for prospective
freshman, a high school senior who has been ac
cepted to Stanford and is considering whether or
not to attend the school. Many prospective fresh
men come visit the campus between the time they

are accepted in early April and the time they
must submit their college decision, May 1.
"Pro fro bio cho" is the phenomenon which
occurs when a prospective freshman attends a
party at Stanford and, unaccustomed to the in
tensity of partying at the college level or hell
bent to show himself or herself akin to a fish in
drinking ability, proceeds to experience some
rather unpleasant physical side effects as a result
of his or her activities at the party.
Now that's as explicit as we're going to get
here. If the exact meaning of this phrase is still
unclear to anybody, they'll have to call me at The
Daily office to get a clearer explanation, because
I've already departed far enough from this
column's usual standards of good taste.
Dear Bug Me,
Why is it that the inside of a head of lettuce is al
ways colder (if it's been in the fridge, anyway)
than the outside?
- Q. Rious
Vegetable phenomena aren't exactly my bag of
tricks, but this question was easily answered with
the help of Joe Garcia, a grocer in the produce
section of the Menlo Park Safeway.
Garcia said that this phenomenon occurs be
cause the lettuce is being refrigerated. In the
refrigerator, there is a continuous flow of cold air
over the lettuce. This air takes the moisture out
of the lettuce's outer layers, which in turn raises
the temperature of the lettuce.
The inside of the head, meanwhile, remains
moist and, therefore, colder.
Garcia went on to explain that this is why
grocers are always spraying their vegetables — to
keep them from drying out and losing their fresh
ness. He said that because vegetables are 80-90
percent water, they lose a lot of vitamins if they
dry out, so keeping them moist also preserves
maximum nutritional value.
Dear Bug Me,
What is the Delta Upsilon definition of an
"Atomic drop" (p. 24, '86 Draw book)? Is it that
they have the capability of a limited nuclear strike
against Res Ed? Where are the nearest bomb shel
ters?
- Unguaranteed in '87
This is much too inflammatory a question fof
me to tackle at any length. I certainly don't want
to add any incendiary rhetoric to the already for
midable flames of controversy licking at the DU
house.
However, several reliable sources tell me that
"atomic drop" refers to the act of dropping bur
ning furniture off the house's third floor balcony.
