# 400 rally against University policy
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Four hundred students yester
day attended a noontime White
Plaza rally organized by Stanford
Out of South Africa, displaying
support of the group's demands
that the University divest its South
Africa-related holdings.
One hundred students followed
SOSA and Black Student Union
members in a march to the home
of University President Donald
Kennedy following the rally,
which marked the best-attended
apartheid protest on campus since
last spring.
The rally took place hours after
student representatives had met
with special committees of Stan
ford's Board of Trustees at Ken
nedy's home to present arguments
for total divestment.
Students, faculty and guest
speakers at the rally affirmed what
they called the moral necessity of
the University's divesting totally
from companies doing business in
white-dominated South Africa.
Swarthmore Acting Prof. Den
nis Brutus lectured the crowd

against forming rationalizations
against divestment.
"Don't intellectualize your way
out of the issue," he said, joining
other speakers in praising the ef
forts of South African Bishop
Desmond Tutu for condemning
South Africa's existing apartheid
regime despite "great personal
risk."
Keith Archuleta, assistant direc
tor of Stanford's Row Office and a
resident fellow at Mirrielees,
warned that a failure to divest
could result in a boycott by blacks
in the Stanford community of the
University's impending Centen
nial campaign.
Several speakers mentioned last
month's ASSU referendum in
which students voted for divest
ment by a two-to-one ratio.
"The ball's in [the University's]
court now," said law student
Vasavan Samuel, one of the stu
dents who spoke before the trus
tees.
Sophomore Amanda Kemp, an
other student representative, re
ported that members of the trustee
committees had suggested at the
meeting that rejecting donations from
South Africa-related businesses
would hurt the livelihood of the Uni
versity.
"My question to the trustees is:
What kind of University are you
trying to maintain?" Kemp said.
"Since when do donations deter

mine the morals of our University?"
Samuel said.
Kennedy did not make an appear
ance before students who marched to
his home, but Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons transmitted the
protesters' demands to Kennedy and
the committee groups present.
Lyons affirmed later that the trus
tees "feel very strongly" about the
issue of divestment, predicting a
move on their part to divest partially
Stanford holdings.
