than investment banking, while con
sidering yourself to have good
"people skills," perpetual new ideas,
plus a touch of savvy, then you've got
the right combination to break into
the field of advertising.
The ad industry is a high-profile
business that generates a great deal of
energy and money. Last year, it wit
nessed an expenditure of nearly $16
billion for broadcast-cable spots
alone, a figure that does not even
begin to take into account the huge
amount of funds spent on print
media.
We are all naked in the eyes of ad
vertising. It wants to clean, dress,
feed, advise, educate and subtly ma
nipulate us from the word go — and it
does an impressive job at exactly that.
Most people are probably unaware
that commercials are generally heard
by their target audience more often
than the number one song on the
charts, according to Jerry Gibbons,
the president and chief executive offi
cer of Doyle Dane Bernbach adver
tising agency in San Francisco.
The common denominator of this
business ultimately boils down to
people — at many different levels.

People in an ad agency must work
together intensely to produce a cam
paign that will in turn convince
people to buy its clients' products.
"It's people, people, people all the
time," according to Dan Odishoo,
vice president of the San Francisco
agency Foote, Cohn & Belding. "You
work with people all day, you sell to
people all day; hence, you've got to
understand people."
Accordingly, advertising is a very
demanding, competitive industry, as
it is highly dependant on often fickle
individuals. Who's to say that an
image the public likes today will still
be liked tomorrow? There are a lot of
pressures built in to the business,
Gibbons said, because an agency is
always working to improve what it
did last time, let alone trying to out
sell similar products which are simul
taneously marketed by different
agencies.
"You need to sell an image," as
well as the product that goes along
with it, Gibbons explained. "People
are more likely to buy from a com
pany with whom they're familiar, and
for whom they have a high regard,"
he added.
Ad agencies involve themselves al
most exclusively with the essential
task of creating such a "regard" for
their clients' products. The way an
agency accomplishes such a feat
varies with the mood of the public.
Recently there has been "a move to
what the industry would probably say
is 'attention getting, entertaining ad
vertising,' " Odishoo said.

You work with
people all day,
you sell to people
all day; hence,
you've got to un
derstand people.

In comparison to the rest of
"corporate America"the business of
advertising sets itself apart in a vari
ety of ways. To begin, there is no
"typical day" at work. Depending on
what department a person is in — ac

counts, marketing or creative —each
day a person can find themselves
doing something unexpected.
For the financially minded, the ac
counts department, which can lead
into account mangagement, supervi
sion and on up to director of account
service, CEO or even president of the
agency, is likely the appropriate place
to begin.
An account executive acts as the
primary liason between the client and
the agency, and is ultimately respon

sible for all aspects of the campaign.
More creative types will be drawn
toward the creative department.
This is the most diverse area of the
agency, involving copywriters and ar
tists of all genres, who are in charge
of creating or designing the final
product; the advertising itself.
Lastly, there is the marketing de
partment, which is looked to for all
sorts of research related to consumer
trends, product evaluation and
numerous other forms of statistical

insight.
A constant in all the departments,
however, is an emotional involve
ment with the advertising an agency
produces. "This is not a strictly ra
tional business," Odishoo explained.
"There are two sides of your brain;
one is rational and one is emotional.
The best kind of advertising probably
touches both."
The reason that a lot of people in
the business are so enthusiastic about
their work relates back to the fact

that they are emotionally involved
with it, he added.
So, the emotion, the pressure and
the indefinable sense of glamour have
managed to draw your interest to this
field. The ensuing question is
naturally, "How do I get involved?"
The answer is not a pretty one.
Career Planning and Placement
Center Director Chris Shinkman ex
plained that very few ad agencies
come to campus to recruit because
"many agencies are relatively small
and are only going to hire one or two
people a year. Plus, they often don't
know about those openings in ad
vance anyway. This coupled with the
fact that they get so many unsolicited
resumes means they don't have any
need to recruit in the first place."
Shinkman urged people who are
interested in the field to be aggressive
in seeking out employment opportu
nities on their own. "Stanford people
tend to be pretty good at that
anyway," he said.
Any contacts or leads a person
might have are definitely worth fol
lowing up, as advertising people are,
on the whole, a fairly open, ap
proachable bunch, and they will try to
aim you in the best direction possible.
Gibbons urges interested students
to delve into as much literature on the
industry as possible, both books and
trade journals, in order to get a better
feel for the business. He reminds the
same people, however, that
"mistakes are very expensive in our
business," and that "you'd better be
sure you love it."
Odishoo stresses that a person
must know how to write well, and
have a decent understanding of statis
tics, as well as a desire to have what
he calls "good ideas."
"This is a business of ideas," he
said, adding, "but no matter who you
are, you're capable of having good
ideas. No matter how uncreative
people tell you you are, don't believe
them. ... Having ideas is strictly like
exercise, in which you can improve
the more you practice.
"Just remember," he added,
"people can't tell you if you're going
to be good in this business or not. At
the start, an agency told me that I was
the worst-suited person in the world
for advertising. . . Yet Odishoo
ended up working for that very same
firm, and has, since then, pursued a
successful career in advertising.
You just gotta keep on plugging at
it.
