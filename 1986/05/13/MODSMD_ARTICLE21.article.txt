## Ivory directs faithful adaptation of Forster novel 'Room with a View' sets up diverting world 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
E.M. Forster wrote the first part of
"A Room with a View" — the part
set in Italy — in 1903, and finished
the manuscript in 1908, after he had
completed two other novels. Forster
described his work-in-progress as
"clear and bright and well
constructed, but so thin." Though
what is "thin" in novels by writers of
Forster's stature and "thin" in con
temporary movies may be two en
tirely different things, that seems to
me a pretty fair summing up of the
new Merchant-Ivory production of
"A Room with a View," directed by
James Ivory and adapted by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala.
Jhabvala has written a screenplay
that is very faithful to Forster, lifting
much of his dialogue and including all
of the major events of the relatively
short book. Jhabvala's job was easier
than one might expect; even in his
early novels, Forster had mastered
the art of writing beautifully mod
ulated dialogue — dialogue which, in
books like "A Room with a View,"
can almost make us believe we're
reading about fully rounded human
beings. The filmmakers have kept the
dialogue, but downplayed some of
the larger thematic elements of the
novel; the result is an impeccably
tasteful, well-crafted movie that is
somewhat more frivolous than the
book on which it was based.
Both book and movie are about the
difficulties young Lucy Honeychurch
(Helena Bonham Carter) faces when
she finds true love while on holiday in
Florence; it comes in the person of
the quiet, reticent, yet passionate
young George Emerson (Julian
Sands), whose ideas and social stand
ing are simply unsuitable for a girl of
Lucy's status and upbringing. Lucy
spends the length of the story denying
her love for George, both to herself
and to her very proper family and ac
quaintances.
It's an Edwardian romantic com
edy, with the Edwardian elements
generating the comedy and getting in
the way of the romance. The comedy
is in Lucy, and in the characters who
surround her: Charlotte Bartlett
(Maggie Smith) is her maiden cousin,
virtually petrified by propriety; Mrs.

Honeychurch (Rosemary Leach) is
her pleasantly muddled mother, who
doesn't pretend to always understand
her daughter; Mr. Emerson
(Denholm Elliot) is George's father,
whose forthrightness is treated with
humor in the first half of the story,
but with growing solemnity in the lat
ter half; Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day
Lewis), Lucy's eventual fiance, is an
intolerably smug aesthete — "The
sort who can know no one intimately,
least of all a woman."
Forster adds to this mixture a kind
of Greek chorus of ancillary charac
ters, who show up in Florence and
later, by a variety of unlikely coin
cidences, in the same village in Eng
land as well. These include Mr. Beebe
(Simon Callow), a clergyman so
freshly scrubbed in this movie he
positively glows; Miss Lavish (Judi
Dench), an opportunistic novelist;
and two spinsterish world travelers,
the Miss Allans (Fabia Drake and
Joan Henley).
Filmmakers Ivory and Jhabvala
don't face the problems David Lean
confronted in his filming of "A Pas
sage to India"; "A Room with a
View" is not an ambiguous novel, and
it has a small, comfortable scope. It's
certainly easy to follow. It's schematic
— even episodic — and Forster play
fully comments on his structuring in
the amusingly explicit chapter
headings (the moviemakers keep
these headings as inserts between
episodes). So the movie stays excep
tionally neat and well-constructed
simply by following Forster's design.
The individual scenes play surpris
ingly well, too. The best of these in
clude George's first kiss with Lucy
and a carriage ride through the Italian
countryside. Ivory even pulls off what
is undoubtedly the trickiest episode in
the book: Mr. Beebe, George and
Lucy's brother, Freddy (Rupert
Graves), strip buck naked and frolic
in an English forest pool, and are
surprised by the strolling company of
Lucy, Cecil and Mrs. Honeychurch.
Ivory and his actors triumph over
the potential awkwardness of this
scene (actors gamboling naked al
most never look natural) through a
combination of deadpan camera tech
niques, unusually beautiful photogra
phy (by Tony Pierce-Roberts) and
high spirits. Lucy's amused little

giggle at the cavorting trio is near
perfection, as is Cecil's ferocious
bushwhacking (apparently an attempt
to drive out the vile woodland satyrs).
Ivory's direction scores points for
neatness, but he doesn't do anything
special in this movie; he lays out the
incidents and lets them fall into place,
and he treats just about everything
with equal emphasis. When he wants

to underscore certain moments, the
music swells in the background. In
fact, it seems a bit loud in the scenes
in Florence, where the filmmakers
use a Puccini aria to indicate the char
acters' rising passions in the romantic
Italian landscapes; these passions,
which are more talked about than
acted upon, really aren't up to those
expressed in the music.

The occasional tendency to over
load the characters' emotions and
relationships with significance can be
traced back to the book, in which
Forster is continually drawing paral
lels between his characters and Greek
gods. This amusing conceit (one
which the author himself refuses to
take too seriously) is most apparent
in Lucy, George and the scenes in

Italy, where such gods as Phaethon,
Pan, Eros, Pallas Athene and Per
sephone are invoked. What's curious
about the book is that Forster, while
not absolutely sincere in these com
parisons, is not entirely joking either,
and there is a level at which Forster
really believes in the heroic scale of
Lucy and George's love.
Forster is at his most didactic in his

condemnation of the characters'
benighted "propriety," and the ways
in which it inhibits the expression of
true love. According to Forster, sti
fling propriety comes between
humans and the gods, and George,
who is closer to divinity than anyone
else, is Michelangelesque when
compared with the simpering Cecil
Vyse or the prim Charlotte Bartlett.
When Forster writes, "They have
sinned against passion and truth, and
vain will be their strife after virtue,"
he's describing the Charlottes and
Cecils who have fallen from Forster's
humanistic grace, and the solemnity
of the description is somewhat out of
proportion with the small stature of
these characters.
At the same time, the overarching
theme of the supreme sanctity of
human love, and its inability to
flourish in the restrictive upper class
environment, is what gives "A Room
with a View" any sort of scope at all;
without it, it's in danger of becoming
a bit of fluff about a girl who can't
make up her mind whether she likes a
man or not. And the movie, which
lacks a narrative substitute for
Forster's didacticism, faces this dan
ger as well.
Ivory and Jhabvala make little ef
fort to inflate the characters' pas
sions; they keep the movie very light
and entertaining, and Forster's views
on love and life are expressed directly
only once, by George's father, in an
episode near the end. It's not surpris
ing that this scene is the worst in the
movie; the ideas it presents are
poorly developed, and when we see
Forster's creations in the flesh up on
the screen, they embody his themes
even less well than they do in the
novel. (While reading, we can play
along with the gods/humans com
parisons, but everyone in this movie
is decidedly less than godlike.)
Nevertheless, perhaps because
they're all speaking Forster's
dialogue, the performers here are a
very confident and enjoyable group.
The sole exception is Bonham Carter,
whose Lucy doesn't seem quite the
vessel for passion that the author in
tended. She fits Forster's description
of "a young lady with a quantity of
dark hair and a very pretty, pale, un
developed face" perfectly, but she
doesn't have any kind of focused

emotional energy, and we aren't ex
actly sure what her Lucy is thinking
from one moment to the next (we
practically need Forster's authorial
voice in some scenes). Bonham
Carter certainly doesn't have the skill
to suggest Lucy's potential trans
formation into a Charlotte Bartlett,
so the threat to Lucy's forthright, un
inhibited nature remains nebulous.
The rest of the performers are, for
the most part, more than adept at this
level of "Masterpiece Theatre"
refinement. Maggie Smith's Charlotte
needs more personality; I felt I knew
the character in the book better than
the one in the movie. But Smith looks
so perfect — with her hair done up in
a giant pincushion, and her face so
pinched you practically wince looking
at it — that she carries us along
nicely.
Daniel Day Lewis (from "My
Beautiful Laundrette") is much too
broad with his characterization; he
seems the distilled quintessence of
every effete English snob you've ever
seen in movies or theatre. I couldn't
believe that Lucy would ever consider
marrying his Cecil, though this is
partly the fault of the filmmakers;
they don't underscore the fact that
Lucy has rejected Cecil twice before
and might, at this point, have decided
that she can get no one better.
Denholm Elliot brings to life
Forster's sketchy description of
George's father, and Julian Sands,
who has even less to work with as
George (he's more an idea than a
character), suggests a personality at
once passionate yet recessive.
This movie is very proud of its
tastefulness and cultured atmosphere.
The $3 million it cost (making it the
most expensive Merchant-Ivory
movie yet) bought a lot of refine
ment, and the production details
don't disappoint. By staying so close
to the spirit and structure of Forster,
much of the filmmakers' job simply
involved filling in the backgrounds
with authentic detail. "A Room with
a View" doesn't give you a lot to
think about, but there's more than
enough to watch; it even has its little
shocks, like the expression on the
face of a murdered man in Florence,
and the aforementioned forest pool
scene. It's a very diverting evening at
the movies.
