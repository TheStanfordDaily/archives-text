# Husker Du show is frenzied but exhilarating
## 
### DAN DELANEY 
Husker Du, in their frenzied con
cert at the Fillmore in the City Sat
urday night, demonstrated why in
telligent rock critics across the
United States consider them to be
the finest underground band in the
nation.
A thousand or more ecstatic fans
gathered at the group's local gig for
an intensive exhibit of rock'n'roll
primal scream therapy. The set,
which was approximately 30 songs
long, included three encores.
Formed in Minneapolis in 1979,
Husker Du (whose name means
"Do you remember?" in Nor
wegian) consists of guitarist Bob
Mould and drummer Grant Hart
(who together handle lead vocals
and songwriting chores), along with
bassist Greg Norton. They have
released eight albums in less than
five years.
The band members have a strange
onstage image. All three wore T

shirts at this particular show. Nor

moustache, occasionally leapt into
the air to emphasize the impact of a

continue to play
original, schizo
phrenic music for
years to come.

riff. Mould and Hart both sport beer
bellies. Neither would be considered
attractive by the hordes of adoles
cent girls who dream of Duran

Duran.
Although they lack the image, the
shallowness and the success of the
Motley Crues of this world, they
more than make up for these
shortcomings in intensity, intelli
gence and clout.
Hart's drumming in the Fillmore
show was sparse and to the point. No
self-indulgent solos, no revolving
drum kits. Nonetheless, Hart can
roll faster than most drummers in
the United States, and he's only
been playing for six years. It was
amazing to see how much a good
drummer can do with a set one
hundredth the size of those of most
heavy metal bands.
Mould demonstrated why he has
been called "the modern-day singer
for the neurotic." His primal
screams were a catharsis for the
crowd. One concert-goer marveled
at how amazing he thought it was
that Hart and Mould were able to
"scream in harmony."
In concert, Husker Du strays from

the vinyl in that they concentrate on
playing energized rock. On the other
hand, their albums ("Zen Arcade"
in particular) have been distin
guished by experimentation with
backward-masking, submerged and
subliminal lyrics, hard core fugues,
heavy metal, folk and "alienated
piano" ballads.
Husker Du's music is the antith
esis of banal commercial pop. Its
distinct sound, which, thanks to
Mould, occasionally borders on
cacophony, is sure to alienate the
hordes of lobotomized Pat Benatar
fans.
The band's lyrics are acidic and
disturbing. But if you take the time
to look past the white noise, you will
see that Mould and Hart are
songwriters with deft poetic sen
sibilities and sure senses of rhythm
and melody.
The crowd at the concert was
varied. There were pseudo
intellectuals with horn-rimmed
glasses and dog-eared copies of

"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest." There were beautiful lesbians
with multi-colored hair who would
kiss each other and then chug down

Mould and Hart

bellies.

St. Pauli Girls. There were curly
haired midgets who got lost among
the legs. There was an editor for the
UCLA Bruin who suggested that

UCLA women are "the most beauti
ful, intelligent girls in the world."
There was a slant-eyed entrepre
neur, fatter than a volcano, who
took marijuana hits off a Sneak-a-
Toke; in an aside to his obese
girlfriend, he remarked, "Wow, this
place is weird." There was an
anorexic girl, dressed in leather and
studs, sitting slumped against a wall
with conspicuous tracks up her arm.
And, of course, there were the
muscle-headed flat-tops who, with
their violent slamming, proved that
Darwin's "Descent of Man" was es
sentially correct. Several of the
drunkest, most obnoxious slammers
ended the evening's festivities with
blood-smeared faces. One fellow,
his face dripping blood into the
bathroom sink, asked of his fellow
patrons, "What kind of bathroom is
this? Where's the drugs?"
If Saturday night's show is any in
dicator, Husker Du is a band that
will continue to play original, schizo
phrenic music for years to come.

which was approximately 30 songs
long, included three encores.
Formed in Minneapolis in 1979,
Husker Du (whose name means
"Do you remember?" in Nor
wegian) consists of guitarist Bob
Mould and drummer Grant Hart
(who together handle lead vocals
and songwriting chores), along with
bassist Greg Norton. They have
released eight albums in less than
five years.
The band members have a strange

riff. Mould and Hart both sport beer
bellies. Neither would be considered
attractive by the hordes of adoles
cent girls who dream of Duran

Duran.
Although they lack the image, the
shallowness and the success of the
Motley Crues of this world, they
more than make up for these
shortcomings in intensity, intelli
gence and clout.
Hart's drumming in the Fillmore
show was sparse and to the point. No
self-indulgent solos, no revolving
drum kits. Nonetheless, Hart can
roll faster than most drummers in
the United States, and he's only
been playing for six years. It was
amazing to see how much a good
drummer can do with a set one
hundredth the size of those of most
heavy metal bands.
Mould demonstrated why he has
been called "the modern-day singer
for the neurotic." His primal
screams were a catharsis for the
crowd. One concert-goer marveled
at how amazing he thought it was
that Hart and Mould were able to
"scream in harmony."
In concert, Husker Du strays from

the vinyl in that they concentrate on
playing energized rock. On the other
hand, their albums ("Zen Arcade"
in particular) have been distin
guished by experimentation with
backward-masking, submerged and
subliminal lyrics, hard core fugues,
heavy metal, folk and "alienated
piano" ballads.
Husker Du's music is the antith
esis of banal commercial pop. Its
distinct sound, which, thanks to
Mould, occasionally borders on
cacophony, is sure to alienate the
hordes of lobotomized Pat Benatar
fans.
The band's lyrics are acidic and
disturbing. But if you take the time
to look past the white noise, you will
see that Mould and Hart are
songwriters with deft poetic sen
sibilities and sure senses of rhythm
and melody.
The crowd at the concert was
varied. There were pseudo
intellectuals with horn-rimmed
glasses and dog-eared copies of

"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest." There were beautiful lesbians
with multi-colored hair who would
kiss each other and then chug down

St. Pauli Girls. There were curly
haired midgets who got lost among
the legs. There was an editor for the
UCLA Bruin who suggested that

UCLA women are "the most beauti
ful, intelligent girls in the world."
There was a slant-eyed entrepre
neur, fatter than a volcano, who
took marijuana hits off a Sneak-a-
Toke; in an aside to his obese
girlfriend, he remarked, "Wow, this
place is weird." There was an
anorexic girl, dressed in leather and
studs, sitting slumped against a wall
with conspicuous tracks up her arm.
And, of course, there were the
muscle-headed flat-tops who, with
their violent slamming, proved that
Darwin's "Descent of Man" was es
sentially correct. Several of the
drunkest, most obnoxious slammers
ended the evening's festivities with
blood-smeared faces. One fellow,
his face dripping blood into the
bathroom sink, asked of his fellow
patrons, "What kind of bathroom is
this? Where's the drugs?"
If Saturday night's show is any in
dicator, Husker Du is a band that
will continue to play original, schizo
phrenic music for years to come.
