## Tough draw for Card men at NCAA tennis 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
This Saturday morning while
most of the Bay Area lies sleeping,
eight students from Stanford will
be in the Peach State battling the
Crimson on the campus of the
Bulldogs.
Yesterday the NCAA released
the seedings and the pairings for
the 1986 men's tennis champion
ships which begin Saturday at the
University of Georgia in Athens.
The Cardinal has been named
the No. 6 seed and will face the
Crimson of Harvard at 8 a.m. in
the first round of the champion
ships. The winner of this shades-of
red contest will then play the win
ner of the Oklahoma State-
Clemson match on Sunday.
In addition, four Cardinal
players have qualified for the indi
vidual championships which will
begin on Thursday, May 22, in
Athens. Seniors Dan Goldie and
Jim Grabb, along with sophomore
Patrick McEnroe, will compete in
the NCAA singles championships.
The 13th-ranked pair of Goldie
and Grabb and the 15th-ranked
duo of McEnroe and senior John
Letts will strive for the doubles
crown.
In the team championships,
which run from Saturday to Tues
day, the Mustangs of Southern

Methodist University have gar
nered the No. 1 seed. They are fol
lowed by No. 2 UCLA, No. 3
Clemson, N0.4 USC and No. 5
Pepperdine.
Both Clemson and UCLA are in
Stanford's half of the draw, and
Stanford Coach Dick Gould thinks
those could be the teams to beat.
"UCLA hasn't lost since the
second match of the year and
SMU has two losses, so 1 don't un
derstand why (the Bruins) aren't
seeded No. 1," Gould said yester
day."And I think Clemson could
win the whole damn thing."
The other teams included in the
16-team field are LSU, Arkansas,
California, Utah, Georgia, Miami,
Texas and Minnesota.
This year's Stanford team,
which finished the regular season
with a 15-5 record overall, 7-3 in
the Pac-10, will bring an impres
sive winning tradition to Athens.
Since 1973 the Cardinal has won
seven NCAA team championships
and has been runner-up three
other years.
Also over that time span, Card
inal players have won five singles
titles and three doubles titles.
Stanford has fared even better
in Athens, where the champion
ships have been played since 1977.
In those nine years the Cardinal
has won it all five times. Now the
team will try to make it six for 10.
