# Stanford earns NCAA bid
## Cardinal still in the running to host one of eight regionals 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Yesterday the NCAA awarded three teams,
Stanford among them, at-large bids into postseason
regional tournaments.
The tournaments, to be played at eight sites
around the country, will begin Friday, May 23. The
winner of each regional will advance to Omaha,
Neb., the site of the College World Series, May 30-
June 8.
A total of 40 teams will receive berths into
postseason play.
A group of 12 schools — Rutgers, Rider, Navy,
Florida State, Eastern Kentucky, UC-Santa Bar
bara, UCLA, Louisiana State, Western Carolina,
Louisiana Tech, Jackson State and San Diego State
— received automatic bids by virtue of winning
their conference championships.
Most of the remaining 25 spots — 13 to be exact
— will go to the champions from other, unsettled,
leagues. That leaves only 12 at-large bids available
for the rest of the country.

The NCAA also named one regional site yester
day, LSU.
The NCAA Baseball Committee announced that
on Monday, May 19, it would release a list of the
other seven regional sites and the 12 schools re
ceiving the remaining at-large bids.
Stanford, which clinched a second-place finish in
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division by
taking two of three games from California over the
weekend, advances to postseason play for the fifth
consecutive year.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess, in Los Angeles
yesterday as part of the NCAA Committee, was
unavailable for comment.
Marquess had earlier said that hopes of hosting
one of the two Western Regionals at Sunken Dia
mond for the second straight year remain alive.
Stanford is one of six schools — Washington State,
UCLA, Hawaii, Arizona and SDSU are the others
— to have submitted bids to the NCAA to host.
The NCAA, according to Marquess, considers a
variety of criteria when assessing the bids. The size
of the guarantee — the NCAA insists that the host
school insures against financial loss — and the on

field finish of the team weigh into the calculation.
UCLA, whieh does not draw well and has never
hosted a regional, is an unlikely candidate — even
though the school captured the Six-Pac title.
Hawaii, because it must fund the travel expenses of
the participants, would have to tender a lucrative
bid. Moreover, Hawaii finished second in its
league, the Western Athletic Conference.
That leaves Arizona (the Six-Pac's third-place
finisher), SDSU (which submitted a late bid after
winning last weekend's WAC tournament), WSU
(from the lowly Pacific 10 Conference Northern
Division) and Stanford.
From that bunch, Stanford seems the likely
choice. The Cardinal has hosted before, and with
success.
In other baseball news, Stanford's Lee Plemel
and Mark Davis were named Pitcher and Player of
the Week, respectively, from the Six-Pac yesterday.
Plemel, in winning his sixth game of the year
against three losses, pitched a nine-hit complete
game against Cal Sunday. Davis stroked three
homers over the weekend, giving him seven on the
year, and knocked in five runs to earn his award.


Ruben Amaro has participated in the NCAA regionals in each of his
first two seasons at Stanford. This year, the junior third baseman will
make it three in a row, as the Cardinal earned an NCAA bid yesterday.

Stanford will be making its fifth straight tournament appearance. The
Cardinal also has a chance to host one of two West regionals, competing
with UCLA, Arizona, Hawaii, Washington State and San Diego State.
