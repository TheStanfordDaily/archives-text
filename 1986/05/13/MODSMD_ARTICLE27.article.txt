# Crew finishes third at Pacific Coast regatta

### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
They said they were saving their best races
for last, and for the Stanford crews, talk
wasn't cheap.
The Cardinal men and women went into
the Pacific Coast Rowing Championships held
in Sacramento this weekend aiming to make
their last regatta their best, and they proved it
early, placing all 10 boats entered into the
finals on Sunday. "It was very exciting,"
men's Coach Ken Dreyfuss said. "It was
something really special."
The excitement had just begun for the men,
who went on to their best showing in nearly
20 years. "Our goal Saturday was to get into
the finals," Dreyfuss said. "Our goal Sunday
was to get into the top three, to get a medal.
"The frosh and novice men really set the
tone for the day," Drevfuss said. "The tone

was a winning one. Both the frosh and the
novice raced their best races of the year
placing second."
The frosh turned the tables on California,
which had beaten them last weekend, and al
most did the same to Washington. Trying to
stage a come-from-behind victory, the frosh
boat moved from fifth at the halfway point in
the race to third in the next 500 meters and
second at the finish, strongly challenging
Washington for the lead.
The novice race was heartbreaking.
Leading for 1,950 meters in the 2,000-meter
race, the Cardinal lost it to Orange Coast Col
lege in the last three strokes.
Orange Coast, who had been the bane of
the novice crew all season, showed their
respect for the Cardinal by riding back in their
boats. "It was a wonderful show of sports
manship," Dreyfuss said.
The fine showing by these boats indicates

that Stanford has the strongest incoming class
on the West Coast, both physically and men
tally. "Their performance on the water was
echoed by an equally strong performance off
the water in reacting to early season defeats,"
Dreyfuss said.
Much of the credit belongs to frosh/novice
coaches Mark Hanlcy and Dave Bunnett.
"They not only did a great job with their own
crews, but were a major help to the spirit and
professionalism of the whole organization,"
Dreyfuss said.
Fourth-place finishes by the varsity four
and junior varisty four boats further boosted
the morale of the men's team.
The varsity men's crew, trying to salvage a
season of disappointments, started on Satur
day by avenging its previous loss to Long
Beach State. The threat of powerhouses
Washington and Cal awaited them in the
finals on Sunday, however.

"Cal and Washington push each other be
cause of tradition, their training and their
manpower," Dreyfuss said. "But our crew
would not let that happen." Cal, as expected,
pulled ahead early and finished first with open
water behind them. But the Cardinal stayed
side-by-side with Washington throughout the
race, and were just 1.5 seconds behind at the
half. Their third-place finish was a mere six
seconds behind the Huskies.
The performance is the best for the men
since 1969. "It's fitting to say the varsity eight
and the whole weekend changed two decades
of disappointment into a total feeling of op
timism and enthusiasm," Dreyfuss said.
With the men just reaching their peak, the
women continued to dominate in their
bracket. "It was a fine finish to a season of ex
cellence. They really showed the way for the
men." Dreyfuss said.
The women's performance, while just as

excellent as the men's, was nonetheless disap
pointing. "The women have done better,"
women's Asst. Coach Wendy Davis said.
But it would be hard to do much better, as
the women's varsity took a strong second be
hind Washington. The margin of victory was
more than the Cardinal had hoped for,
however. "We wanted to be a lot closer,"
Davis said. "Washington was a lot faster than
last time. They looked like a totally different
crew."
The other Cardinal boats couldn't quite get
on track to finish the season as well as it had
started. The junior varsity boat took third,
while the novice boat and the novice four
took fifth-place finishes. The novice fell to
teams it had beaten previously in the year, in
cluding UCLA and Cal.
"They had a good race, but everyone else
had a better race," Davis said. "That's boat
racine."
