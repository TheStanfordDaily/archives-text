French not informed of radiation
PARIS — An embarrassed French government appointed a special
Cabinet committee yesterday to reassure the French population in the
face of a bitter controversy over the government's failure for more than
a week to inform the people about the increased radiation coming from
the Soviet nuclear plant disaster in Chernobyl.
The government, which until last weekend had not acknowledged the
extent of the increase in radiation in France, was denounced by several
newspapers for lying to the French people.
The controversy erupted when Pierre Pellerin, director of the Service
of Radiation Protection, admitted Saturday that, despite government as
surances to the contrary, radiation levels had reached levels in some
places of 300 to 400 times higher than normal.
With 44 nuclear plants producing 64.8 percent of its electricity,
France is more dependent on nuclear energy than any other country in
the world, and critics implied that the government withheld the truth out
of fear of jeopardizing the country's nuclear program and of hurting
sales of its agricultural products.
Libya expels 36 Western diplomats
CAIRO, Egypt — Libya announced yesterday that it was ordering 36
Western diplomats to leave the country. Radio Tripoli said it was in
response to expulsions of Libyans from European countries.
The countries concerned are West Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.
A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn said later that
four members of the West German Embassy in Tripoli had been given
10 days to leave the country.
On April 23 West Germany reduced the size of the Libyan Embassy
in Bonn from 22 to 19 members as part of Common Market anti
terrorist measures after indications that Moammar Khadafy's regime
was behind the April 5 bomb attack at a West Berlin discotheque and
other terrorist activities.
Fourth Canadian minister resigns
TORONTO — A senior minister in Canada's Cabinet resigned yes
terday amid allegations that his wife had taken advantage of his govern
ment position to get favorable loans for their foundering family real
estate business.
Industry Minister Sinclair Stevens was the fourth member to depart
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Cabinet in the past 15 months amid
charges of improprieties. These assorted episodes have become major
preoccupations of the Mulroney government, which in September 1984
won a four-year mandate with 211 of the 248 seats in Parliament, the
largest majority in Canadian history.
Mulroney, who has been touring the Far East during most of the two
weeks that the Stevens controversy has raged in the House of Commons
and in Canadian newspapers, accepted the resignation from Peking,
where he and senior aides took time out from an official visit to deal with
the troubles back home. In a letter to Stevens, Mulroney acceded to the
departing minister's request to appoint an "impartial person" to investi
gate the charges against him.
Marcos holds press conference
MANILA, Philippines — Deposed President Ferdinand Marcos said
yesterday that he wants to be buried in the Philippines, but he quickly
added that he would return sooner if it would prevent a government
takeover by the Communists or the military, both of which he said may
be imminent.
"But I am certainly not going to come back on my own," Marcos said
in a telephone press conference. He said it would take "a spontaneous
demand of our people" to convince him that he should return and at
tempt to reclaim the presidency.
Marcos also said that he fled the country last Feb. 25 only to save his
wife and family.
The press conference was organized by former employees of Marcos'
Ministry of Information. They set up a telephone link between the
Marcos' exile home in Honolulu and a room where about two dozen
journalists had gathered in suburban Manila.
During the 40-minute session, Marcos also:
• Charged the government of President Corazon Aquino with violating
his human rights by denying him a passport to travel, revoking the pass
port of his Manila-based lawyer and threatening to arrest him if he
returns to the Philippines.
• Described his life in exile as lonely. He said he is in constant contact ,
with the U.S. State Department, which "is trying to work out for us more
comfortable circumstances."
• Repeated his assertion that the U.S. government forcibly removed him
from the Philippines last February and that he is still the only legitimate
president.
• Denied allegations that he has been trying to destabilize Aquino's gov
ernment by means of sometimes violent street demonstrations in Manila.
But in a short statement at the end of the press conference he encour
aged his supporters to continue their protests.
Haiti probes Baby Doc corruption
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Haitian authorities are tracing more
than $360 million they say deposed President Jean-Claude Duvalier ap
propriated from the government and transferred out of the country, ac
cording to officials and lawyers conducting the search.
That alleged sum is the first specific figure to emerge from an aggres
sive hunt by the 3-month-old National Government Council to track
down what they call Duvalier's corrupt gains and return them to Haiti.
Investigators said they arrived at that amount by reviewing ministry
ledgers, charges made against bank accounts here in the names of
Duvalier and dozens of his associates and overseas wire transfers.
Justice Minister Francois Latortue, who heads the search, said in an .
interview that he believes as much as $367 million may be frozen in
banks in Switzerland.
Latortue estimated Duvalier's overall worth at about $900 million.
Other top officials called that figure exaggerated in light of Haiti's im
poverished economy and its limited foreign reserves.
According to the council, an examination of Duvalier's seized proper
ties indicated that the government was virtually his only source of
income. He apparently owned no income-earning businesses.
Gandhi reshuffles Indian cabinet
NEW DELHI, India — Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi under
took a major reshuffle of his Cabinet yesterday, dropping External Af
fairs Minister Bali Ram Bhagat while giving greater representation to

months, was replaced by longtime Gandhi aide Shiv Shankar, the pres
ent commerce minister.
In the reshuffle announced by the prime minister s office, Shankar will
continue to hold the commerce portfolio in addition to his new duties.

Home Office portfolio, which makes him responsible for dealing with
domestic problems, including that of his troubled home state of Punjab.
