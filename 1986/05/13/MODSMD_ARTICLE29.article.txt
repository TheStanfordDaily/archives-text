MOSCOW — The Soviet government an
nounced last night that six persons "suffering from
burns and radiation died" as a result of the Cher
nobyl nuclear accident, making it the world's first
nuclear power plant accident with officially re
ported radiation deaths.
Thirty-five persons injured at Chernobyl are in
"grave condition," according to the Council of
Ministers statement published last night by the So
viet news agency Tass and read on the televised
evening news. The last official status report on the
injured on May 1 listed 18 of the 200 victims in
"serious" condition.
Amid signs of wide-scale bungling of the mass
evacuations after the April 26 Chernobyl accident,
three local officials have been reprimanded for mis

handling the evacuation of workers and their
families, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper
Pravda reported yesterday, in the first announced
disciplinary moves against personnel connected
with the nuclear facility, which is 80 miles north of
Kiev.
The 35 gravely injured, hospitalized in Moscow,
are "undergoing therapeutic and preventive treat
ment," the statement said. According to Soviet
sources, an unspecified number of the Chernobyl
patients have had bone marrow transplants — stan
dard medical treatment for radiation victims.
An international team of physicians, including
U.S. marrow specialist Robert Gale and three
other American doctors, have conducted the
operations, Soviet sources said. The Americans
have said they are working under strict conditions

of confidentiality.
Last night's statement left unclear whether the
total Chernobyl death toll is now six or eight. The
last official casualty report — released April 29 —
listed two dead, and Soviet authorities later said
they had been killed by falling debris and steam
burns.
Over the past 24 hours, yesterday's statement
said, "work was considerably broadened" at Cher
nobyl "to clean up contaminated sections of the
territory and structures of the station." It added
that "an effective cooling of the damaged reactor is
under way."
The statement said the radiation situation in
Kiev and in the rest of the Ukraine and neighboring
Byelorussia "is improving."
