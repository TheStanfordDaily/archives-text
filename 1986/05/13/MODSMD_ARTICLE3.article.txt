# Flo Mo funds go a long way

### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
Have you ever thought about
how much money is spent on alco
hol at a typical Stanford party?
Now about those chips and
goldfish? Don't forget the livers
and the DJ or band.

Well, some students have
thought about it for a moment or
two.
In Florence Moore Hall, for ex
ample. a resident assistant and a
group of other concerned students
are currently asking dorms for
funds to sponsor a community li
brary in a vilfage halfwav around

the world.
The student group, whose ef
forts are being spearheaded by
Loro RA Jim Bennett, has to date
raised $560 of their $800 goal (all
within Flo Mo) and has already
received pledges for the
remainder. The money will go to
support a library in the collective
villages of Pandaen and Pelem
Kecut, Yogyakarta province. In
donesia.
Bennett, who came up with the
idea of trying to get the Flo Mo
dorms to sponsor a development
project in a Third World country,
had been working with an organi
zation called International Devel
opment Exchange (IDEX) for
some time. He saw an IDEX list of
development projects available for
sponsorship, realized the relatively
small amounts of money involved and
had the germ of an idea.
"As an RA, I got to see how much
money dorms funneled into things
like parties," he explained. "It
seemed funny that so much money
was going into parties when these
projects — long term, worthwhile
projects — might cost half of that. I
realized that dorms could play a big
ger part in sponsoring projects
abroad."
Bennett found the library proposal
on IDEX's project list. It seemed
ideal, he said, for two major reasons:
"primarily, its focus on education,
and secondly, the size of the financial
request seemed substantial ($800)
yet manageable given the size of
Florence Moore."
Bennett then met with dorm repre
sentatives and other students to see if
there was interest in the project, and
there was. The group then developed
a fund-raising strategy. They spread
information about the project
through the dorms, posting fliers in
stairwells, etc., and generally talked
the project up.
Then came the house meetings,
when dorm reps actually presented
the idea to the residents as a whole.
"The initial response," said Ben
nett, "was overwhelmingly positive."
Five of the seven Flo Mo dorms im
mediately voted to give $115 each
out of dorm funds, while the other
two pledged similar amounts which
they would hold mini fundraisers to
obtain.
The $800 raised by the students
will be used by the library to: main
tain the collection of books for
children, sponsor literacy classes and
study groups, and provide high school
texts and guides concerning health
care, childrearing, and appropriate
technology. The Indonesian commu
nity can afford to pay for their basic
needs and a minimal education, but
cannot afford luxuries, such as books
for their children.
Richard Holmstrom, executive
director of IDEX, said he "was

elated" to hear of the Flo Mo effort.
"This reinforces the notion that Stan
ford students are responsive and can
make a difference," he added.
Bill Ramsey, a Flo Mo resident fel
low, concurred. "Supporting this
project shows that students don't
have to wait to graduate before they
can have an impact on the world."
The beneficial aspects of this kind
of activism may extend beyond life at
Stanford. "Involvement in this kind
of project," said Holmstrom, "may
contribute to (students') long-term
perspectives on poverty, and on fur
ther avenues of involvement."
Loro dorm representative Dan
Brumbaugh agreed. "A lot of stu
dents here will some day be in posi
tions to make differences for less for
tunate individuals, if they choose.
Hopefully this project will act to
remind them that it's possible and
rewarding to do so," he said.

"I realized that
dorms could play
a bigger part."

Holmstrom said that the Flo Mo
fundraiser is a perfect example of
what IDEX is designed to do. This di
rection was first established by Paul
Strasberg, now president of IDEX's
board of directors. "IDEX identifies
projects that need a small amount of
financial support to improve the lives
of poor people in Third World com
munities," said Holmstrom.
He described how IDEX then
presents these projects to interested
American community groups and in
dividuals. "The amounts we're
talking about," he added, "are very
accessible — they range from $200 to
$5,000."
The bottom line, Holmstrom con
cluded, is that "we're trying to take
the tiger by the tail and do something
tangible."
