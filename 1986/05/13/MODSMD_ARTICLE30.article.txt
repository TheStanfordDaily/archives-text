# Deaver may have violated ethics laws
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — While working
in the White House, Michael Deaver
was involved in at least 15 discussions
with U.S. and Canadian officials on
acid rain, the same issue on which he
has since represented Canada as a
private lobbyist, federal officials tes
tified yesterday.
James Hinchman, deputy general
counsel of the General Accounting
Office, told a House subcommittee
that the evidence suggests several
ways in which Deaver may have vio
lated federal conflict-of-interest laws
by participating in these meetings and
then lobbying for the Canadian gov
ernment on the acid rain issue. He
said the GAO has referred its find
ings to the Justice Department,
which has opened an investigation of
Deaver.
For example, Hinchman said,
Deaver actively supported a success
ful proposal within the Reagan Ad

ministration that the United States
and Canada appoint special envoys to
deal with the acid rain problem. "Mr.
Deaver's participation in this particu
lar matter appears to have been sig
nificant and thus substantial,"
Hinchman said, a level that would
have subjected Deaver to a lifetime
legal ban on representing Canada on
the issue.
He said Deaver also may have vio
lated ethics laws by "his very pres
ence" at a meeting on acid rain last
October with the U.S. special envoy,
Drew Lewis, at which Deaver was
representing Canada. The GAO
found that Lewis should have been
considered a White House official,
Hinchman said, and Deaver was
legally barred for one year from offi
cially contacting anyone in the White
House.
Yesterday's hearing before the
House energy and commerce sub

committee on oversight and inves
tigations also raised questions for the
first time about whether then-White
House counsel Fred Fielding should
have disqualified himself from the
Deaver probe sooner than he did be
cause he had discussed a possible job
with Deaver's multimillion-dollar
consulting firm. In a subsequent in
terview, Fielding called this "a misun
derstanding of the facts and the law."
Deaver, who was White House
deputy chief of staff until last May,
said in a statement yesterday that the
GAO testimony "fails to demonstrate
that I have violated any federal laws."
He said the testimony "repeats
various allegations and rumors that
have been circulating in the press for
weeks" and that when the investiga
tions are over, "I will be completely
exonerated of any wrongdoing."
Deaver said he looks forward to
testifying in closed session Friday

before the oversight subcommittee,
chaired by Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.), which he said will enable him
"to tell my side of the story for the
first time."
Deaver said the GAO had not in
terviewed him and that its findings
were based mainly "on the recollec
tions of three individuals, including
David Stockman," the former budget
director. Hinchman said the GAO
did not question Deaver to avoid in
terfering with the Justice Department
probe.
The GAO probe was limited to is
sues involving Deaver's $ 105,000-a
-year contract with Canada, but the
FBI is examing other issues in its pre
liminary investigation of Deaver. The
Justice probe could lead to appoint
ment of an independent counsel, as
Deaver and five Democratic senators
have requested, but the department
must first gather its own evidence.
