SEC charges director
WASHINGTON — The Securities and Ex
change Commission charged yesterday that a
managing director of the securities firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., made $12.6 million in il
legal profits by systematically trading on con
fidential information about mergers and acquisi
tions.
It was the largest insider trading scheme ever,
the agency alleged.
At the SEC's request, a federal judge in New
York yesterday froze the assets of Dennis Levine
and issued a temporary restraining order against
the investment banker, who, the agency said,
made his trades through a financial institution in
the Bahamas, using the code name "Mr. Dia
mond."
Documents filed by the SEC in U.S. District
Court in New York in a civil suit against Levine
detail a scheme that the government alleges went
on for five years. During that time, Levine, who
also worked for two other securities firms during
the period in question, repeatedly took confiden
tial information about deals on which he was
working and turned it into profitable trades.
During the years in question Levine, 33,
worked for some of Wall Street's biggest names,
including Smith Barney Harris LJpham & Co.,
Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.,(which
became part of Shearson Lehman-American Ex
press) as well as Drexel Burnham, the nation's
ninth largest securities firm.
NASA director sworn in
WASHINGTON — It will be more difficult to
restore the National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration's morale and much-criticized
decision-making process than to fix the faulty
solid rocket booster that caused last January's
Challenger disaster, the space agency's new ad
ministrator said yesterday
Shortly after being sworn in at the White
House, millionaire educator-industrialist James
Fletcher told reporters that "there arc a number

of very good design changes which will fix the
problem" with the shuttle rocket but said that
"the hard part is to make sure that our proce
dures are intact."
Fletcher finally took the reins of the space
agency more than two months after President
Reagan persuaded him to return to the post that
he had held for six years during the 19705.
Fletcher said at his first news conference that
he believes the estimate that the grounded
shuttle system will be ready to fly again in the
summer of 1987 — 18 months after the Chal
lenger accident — is "a good one."
Suits go to Indian courts
NEW YORK — A federal judge ruled yester
day that lawsuits stemming from the lethal 1984
release of a cloud of chemical gas from a Union
Carbide Corp. plant in Bhopal, India, should be
heard in Indian courts and moved to dismiss bil
lions of dollars in damage claims filed in the
United States.
But U.S. District Judge John Keenan imposed
several conditions designed to subject Union
Carbide, the prime defendant in the cases, to the
procedures and reach of American courts even if
the lawsuits are tried in India.
Before dismissing the 145 lawsuits that were
filed in U.S. courts and consolidated in his court
room. Keenan said he would require the com
pany to agree to satisfy any judgment reached
against it by the Indian courts; to submit to the
American style of pre-trial discovery, in which
each side produces documents and testimony re
quested as evidence by the other, and to give up
any defense based on the statute of limitations.
FA A fine'unfair'
MIAMI — Eastern Air Lines Chairman Frank
Borman said yesterday that the Federal Aviation
Administration's proposal to fine Eastern a
record $9.5 million for alleged safety violations is
unfair and that FAA administrator Donald En

gen had refused an offer to settle the issue for
less.
In an extraordinary news conference also at
tended by Eastern President Joseph Leonard,
Borman emphasized, however that it is
"absolutely important that the cooperative atti
tude that has existed between the (FAA) and the
airlines for so many years continue and not be al
tered."
Borman said he had offered to settle for $3.5
million, also a record amount, but that Engen
told him that "he was under pressure to make
certain that the airline industry is safe, and could
not consider reducing the fine."
Engen conceded that the FAA has negotiated
lower proposed civil penalty settlements but said
"that changed 18 months ago," when he took of
fice.
Arms rejection harmful
WASHINGTON — The Senate and House re
jection of the Reagan Administration's proposed
arms sale to Saudi Arabia may have sent "the
wrong signal at a critical time" and could be re
sponsible for intensified attacks by Iran on Saudi
ships in the strategic Persian Gulf, the White
House charged yesterday.
In the last eight days, two Saudi oil tankers
have been struck by Iranian aircraft. A White
House statement said the Administration was
"deeply concerned" about the air strikes and
hinted that it would be prepared to take military
action to uphold "the principle of freedom of
navigation" and allow the free flow of oil through
the Strait of Hormuz.
Stocks drift downward
NEW YORK — The stock market drifted
down in dull trading yesterday amid uncertainty
over tax reform and the direction interest rates
and the dollar will take.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dipped 2.10 and closed at 1,787.33.

restore the National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration's morale and much-criticized
decision-making process than to fix the faulty
solid rocket booster that caused last January's
Challenger disaster, the space agency's new ad
ministrator said yesterday
Shortly after being sworn in at the White
House, millionaire educator-industrialist James
Fletcher told reporters that "there arc a number

of very good design changes which will fix the
problem" with the shuttle rocket but said that
"the hard part is to make sure that our proce
dures are intact."
Fletcher finally took the reins of the space
agency more than two months after President
Reagan persuaded him to return to the post that
he had held for six years during the 19705.
Fletcher said at his first news conference that
he believes the estimate that the grounded
shuttle system will be ready to fly again in the
summer of 1987 — 18 months after the Chal
lenger accident — is "a good one."
Suits go to Indian courts
NEW YORK — A federal judge ruled yester
day that lawsuits stemming from the lethal 1984
release of a cloud of chemical gas from a Union
Carbide Corp. plant in Bhopal, India, should be
heard in Indian courts and moved to dismiss bil
lions of dollars in damage claims filed in the
United States.
But U.S. District Judge John Keenan imposed
several conditions designed to subject Union
Carbide, the prime defendant in the cases, to the
procedures and reach of American courts even if
the lawsuits are tried in India.
Before dismissing the 145 lawsuits that were
filed in U.S. courts and consolidated in his court
room. Keenan said he would require the com
pany to agree to satisfy any judgment reached
against it by the Indian courts; to submit to the
American style of pre-trial discovery, in which
each side produces documents and testimony re
quested as evidence by the other, and to give up
any defense based on the statute of limitations.
FA A fine'unfair'
MIAMI — Eastern Air Lines Chairman Frank
Borman said yesterday that the Federal Aviation
Administration's proposal to fine Eastern a
record $9.5 million for alleged safety violations is
unfair and that FAA administrator Donald En

gen had refused an offer to settle the issue for
less.
In an extraordinary news conference also at
tended by Eastern President Joseph Leonard,
Borman emphasized, however that it is
"absolutely important that the cooperative atti
tude that has existed between the (FAA) and the
airlines for so many years continue and not be al
tered."
Borman said he had offered to settle for $3.5
million, also a record amount, but that Engen
told him that "he was under pressure to make
certain that the airline industry is safe, and could
not consider reducing the fine."
Engen conceded that the FAA has negotiated
lower proposed civil penalty settlements but said
"that changed 18 months ago," when he took of
fice.
Arms rejection harmful
WASHINGTON — The Senate and House re
jection of the Reagan Administration's proposed
arms sale to Saudi Arabia may have sent "the
wrong signal at a critical time" and could be re
sponsible for intensified attacks by Iran on Saudi
ships in the strategic Persian Gulf, the White
House charged yesterday.
In the last eight days, two Saudi oil tankers
have been struck by Iranian aircraft. A White
House statement said the Administration was
"deeply concerned" about the air strikes and
hinted that it would be prepared to take military
action to uphold "the principle of freedom of
navigation" and allow the free flow of oil through
the Strait of Hormuz.
Stocks drift downward
NEW YORK — The stock market drifted
down in dull trading yesterday amid uncertainty
over tax reform and the direction interest rates
and the dollar will take.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dipped 2.10 and closed at 1,787.33.
SEC charges director
WASHINGTON — The Securities and Ex
change Commission charged yesterday that a
managing director of the securities firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., made $12.6 million in il
legal profits by systematically trading on con
fidential information about mergers and acquisi
tions.
It was the largest insider trading scheme ever,
the agency alleged.
At the SEC's request, a federal judge in New
York yesterday froze the assets of Dennis Levine
and issued a temporary restraining order against
the investment banker, who, the agency said,
made his trades through a financial institution in
the Bahamas, using the code name "Mr. Dia
mond."
Documents filed by the SEC in U.S. District
Court in New York in a civil suit against Levine
detail a scheme that the government alleges went
on for five years. During that time, Levine, who
also worked for two other securities firms during
the period in question, repeatedly took confiden
tial information about deals on which he was
working and turned it into profitable trades.
During the years in question Levine, 33,
worked for some of Wall Street's biggest names,
including Smith Barney Harris LJpham & Co.,
Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.,(which
became part of Shearson Lehman-American Ex
press) as well as Drexel Burnham, the nation's
ninth largest securities firm.
