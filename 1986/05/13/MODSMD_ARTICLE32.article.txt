Walker's ex-wife testifies
SAN FRANCISCO — The ex-wife of
confessed masterspy John Walker yesterday said
she told his alleged recruit Jerry Whitworth in
1973 that she knew her husband, who "couldn't
be trusted," was trying to get him to spy.
"I told Jerry that I knew John was trying to
recruit him to spy," said Walker's ex-wife, Bar
bara. "He said he hesitated because John
bragged too much and couldn't be trusted ... I
said something to the same effect, that he
couldn't be trusted."
Mrs. Walker, who turned in her former hus
band in late 1984, was granted immunity from
prosecution in exchange for her testimony
against Whitworth.
"(Whitworth) asked me if I could ever turn
John in. I said I did not want revenge," said Mrs.
Walker, who then put a tissue to her mouth, said
she was sick to her stomach, and left the court
room briefly. She said the conversation with
Whitworth about turning in Walker took place in
1976.
Walker, who last week described his former

spouse as a hard-drinking blackmailer, pleaded
guilty last October to spying for the Soviet Union
for 17 years and has already testified against
Whitworth. The Walkers were divorced in 1975.
Whitworth is accused of selling secrets about
Navy code and communications systems for
$332,000 to Walker for relay to the Soviets be
tween 1974 and 1983. Walkers son, Michael,
has pleaded guilty to espionage, and his brother,
Arthur, was convicted by a federal judge.
When asked by the defense whether Arthur
ever told her he was involved in espionage while
stationed in Groton, Conn., in 1968, Mrs.
Walker replied, "Yes."
3 rowers killed in crash

LOS BANOS — A van was traveling about 85
mph when a tire blew and the vehicle rolled off
Interstate 5, killing three San Diego State Uni
versity rowers and injuring 10 others, officials
said yesterday.
All but two of the 13 occupants were ejected,
and the three men who died were among those

thrown from the van, which was heading home
Sunday night from a rowing meet east of
Sacramento, said Highway Patrolman Doyne
Cates.
A dozen men from San Diego State University
and a woman from UC-San Diego were in the
rented van, which had a capacity of 14, Cates
said.
The driver and a passenger in the front seat
were trapped momentarily by their seat belts
when a small fire erupted in the engine compart
ment.
The passenger escaped, but the driver suffered
burns on his feet before two officers pulled him
from the wreckage and put out the fire with ex
tinguishers from their patrol cars, Cates said.
The driver, Joseph Farrage, 19, lost control
when the left rear tire blew.
