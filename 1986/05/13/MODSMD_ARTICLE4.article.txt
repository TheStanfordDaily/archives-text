# Graded distribution considered
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
A recommendation requiring that
students take courses for a grade in
order to fulfill a distribution require
ment will encounter student opposi
tion when it is put to a vote in
Thursday's Faculty Senate meeting.
If approved, the proposal, made by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US), would apply to stu
dents entering the freshman class this
fall. It would not, however, apply to
current students.
The C-US recommendation is
aimed at helping the distribution re
quirement system achieve what it was
designed to achieve — ensuring that
each student has a significant
familiarity with various areas of
knowledge.
But student leaders are critical of
the new proposal and plan to debate
the worth of the recommendation at
Thursday's meeting.
"It is a ridiculous action." said
Carey White, who a tends Faculty
Senate meetings as the chair of the

ASSU Senate.
It is likely that this proposal will
limit the breadth of classes that
grade-conscious students take. White
said. He cited the example of a liberal
arts student who. if the recommenda
tion passes, would take an easy
course to fulfill a distribution require
ment instead of taking a higher level
course pass/no credit.
The C-US. which consists of three
students and seven faculty and staff
members, considered this issue when
making its decision, according to C
US Chairman Marsh McCall, a pro
fessor of classics.
"That situation gave the committee
the longest pause,"' McCall said.
The committee, however, con
eluded that only a few students would
take this approach and that it
wouldn't "break down" the distribu
tion requirement system, he said.
According to data used by the C
US in their decision, students are cur
rently avoiding higher level courses
and taking easier classes pass/no
credit, said Carolyn Lougee, a C-US
member.

The C-US listened to personal and
anecdotal testimony by students, ad
visers and faculty who are worried
that courses being taken for distribu
tion requirements are not being taken
seriously, McCall said.
The C-US also identified a prob
lem with the motivation of teachers
instructing distribution requirement
classes.
Lougee described a cycle in which
teachers invest less time in a class be
cause students are not motivated,
while students in turn are less likely
to become interested if the teacher is
not himself motivated.
McCall said he hopes that the new
proposal will influence both teachers
and students to invest more time in
these classes.
White agreed that the new pro
posal "might make you take (a class)
more seriously," but he stressed that
students want to take a variety of
courses and this recommendation
would make it more difficult to take
classes outside of their field of study.
It will be difficult to defeat the pro
posal in Thursday's meeting. White

said, noting that the two student rep
resentatives have seldom been able to
accomplish their goals in the senate.
Three students will give speeches
criticizing the new proposal at the
meeting, and Larry Bloch. an ASSU
Senate member, will draft a letter to
the Faculty Senate, White said.
White said he hopes student
response to the proposal will per
suade the senate to defeat the pro
posal. but English Prof. Ron Rcb
holz, a member of the Faculty Sen
ate. said student protest would have
to be "more dramatic than a few let
ters to The Daily" in order to influ
ence the senate.
Interest in the new requirement
sprung out of a report by Western
Culture administrators which indi
cated that an increasing number of
students were taking Western Culture
classes pass/no credit, and that the
trend was having a noticable effect on
the classes, Lougee said.
Following that report, the Western
Culture administrators decided not to
continue to offer a pass/no credit op
tion.
