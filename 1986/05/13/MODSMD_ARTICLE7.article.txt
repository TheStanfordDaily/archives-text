# Panel discusses science reporting
## 
### LARRY WEBER Editorial staff 
A panel of four Stanford scientists
and three journalists who cover scien
tific affairs for the news media out
lined the shortcomings and inherent
difficulties of science reporting here
last night.
David Perlman, associate science
editor of the San Francisco Chronicle,
asserted the existence of a two-fold
problem in reporting scientific affairs:
the lack of scientific knowledge that
pervades the non-scientific commu
nity and the difficulty in securing
reliable sources.
"Of course we (reporters) sin" by
being inaccurate, he said. "It
becomes difficult at times to get some
scientists to be straightforward with
you."
As an example, Perlman said that
reporters covering the Chernobyl nu
clear reactor accident faced scientists
who often did not know what kind of
containment system the Soviet reac
tor utilized, and who often felt com
pelled to assert the positive aspects of
U.S. containment methods.
"It is very difficult for science writ
ers to develop a list of people in sci
ence that they can go to when those
stories break," said Sidney Drell,
deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and the
executive head of theoretical physics
at the University.
"You (science reporters) have to
figure out which one of us is worth
talking to," Drell said.
While Philadelphia Inquirer sci
ence and medicine reporter Linda
Herskowitz said, "I am a dissenter in
the idea that clinicians are not under
standable," Stanford chemistry pro
fessor Carl Djerassi said that scien
tific language must be simplified for
the public's understanding.
"With the problem of inaccuracy,
some of it is unavoidable in the
process of simplification," Djerassi
said. "At the very least, the reporter

nas to know his basic vocabulary."
Drell said science reporting has
been successful at conveying "the
excitement of the adventure," but has
failed to inform the public of a central
problem facing the scientific commu
nity.
He warned that scientific research
directed towards military goals is
being more heavily pursued than re
search for other reasons, because of
how research funds are currently
being appropriated.
"We are not investing in basic R
and D (research and development)
work in other parts of science, and
the military has become the consumer
of technology," Drell said.
"I consider it a failure of the sci
ence reporting media that that story
has not been reported and is not
being reported," Drell said.
Von Eshlemen, Stanford professor
of electrical engineering, cited the
coverage of the space shuttle Chal
lenger's failure as an example of how
science reporters neglect the history
of issues and concentrate only on
present events.
According to Eshlemen, the real
cause of the shuttle disaster was a po
litical decision made 15 years ago that
eliminated research and development
of launch technologies other than
what was needed for the shuttle.
"This was a political decision that
steered technology at a time when we
didn't know if it was going to work or
not," said Eshlemen, who co-directs
the Stanford Center for Radar
Astronomy.
"We see very little of this history in
the news media in the discussion of
what is wrong (with the Shuttle pro
gram)," Eshlemen said.
Joan Hamilton, a health and sci
ence reporter for Business Week
magazine, said because reporters are
restricted by space available for their
articles and by deadlines, they are
unable to reprint histories of issues in
every piece.
