"Making money is not what life is
all about, but it doesn't hurt to have
some. It doesn't hurt to have more
than you can possibly spend," Ted
Turner told a capacity crowd at
Kresge Auditorium last night.
Turner, who owns just about
everything from the Cable News
Network to the Atlanta Braves,
talked about just about everything
from the arms race to "total happi
ness."
Beginning on a biographical note,
he said, "College for me was not a
very enlightening experience. After
college 1 went to work for my father
in the billboard business.
"When my father committed
suicide, I was 24 years old. He was
the richest he had ever been in his
life. That set me to thinking.
"There are a lot of different ways
of finding success. Financially is
only one of them," he said, citing
sports and arts as two other possible
pursuits for attaining personal satis
faction.
"If it (what you do for a
livelihood) gives you satisfaction
and you're proud of what you're
doing, then do it. Money should not
be your main concern in life," he
added.
Turner went on to say, "True
happiness comes when you're
working on something that is bigger
than yourself â€” something that you
dedicate your life to. When I do
something, I can't do it halfway. . ..
I was the first to use a commercial
satellite, and it's made me a very
rich man."
Alluding to his extensive travels,
he said, "I realized that we have this
superiority complex in the United
States. There's nothing wrong with
thinking that you're better than
other people as long as you don't
take it seriously.
"You have to give the other
group, society or religion some

credit too, because every living
thing has equal value in the eyes of
God. ... If you were a butterfly,
you'd think that you're just as
valuable as a human being.
"What the world needs now is a
dose a tolerance and respect, not
only for fellow human beings, but
for all the other living things," he
added.
The development of this global
mindset is crucial to solving the
problems of the arms race and envi
ronmental conservation. Turner
said.
"The worst thing that's happen
ing in the world is the nuclear arms
race.... It's a global disgrace.
"In the world today we are

spending between 15 and 20 times
more money on nuclear arms than
we are on education. There is no
excuse for not giving every person
on the earth a decent education," he
said.
"In my opinion, it is the United
States that is responsible for con
tinuing the arms race. The Soviet
Union is willing to call it off. . . .
The Soviets want to live and let
live," Turner said, basing his belief
on personal conversations he has
had with "more than 50" Soviet
government officials.
Among the problems that man
must remedy. Turner considers en
vironmental concerns a top priority.
"No one is against preserving the

environment. If there are business
men who don't care about the envi
ronment, it is (due to) a lack of
knowledge and a lack of education
on their part.
"Economic growth must take a
back seat to preserving the environ
ment," he added.
Believing ;it the "his genera
tion" has p "ed world develop
ment in an undesirable direction, he
said, "If it (the trend of develop
ment) is going to be reversed, you
(the youth of today) are going to
have to be the people to do it. You
kids are going to bear the brunt of a
lot of mistakes that my generaton
has made."
