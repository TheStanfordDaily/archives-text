## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Administration must act 
### 
It was a great idea to have a forum devoted to the
discussion of the decision-making process at Stanford
and the issue of governance. A way to open the chan
nels of communication between the administration and
other sectors of the community. The beginning of a
constructive dialogue.
The dialogue which was supposed to take place
Friday night in Cubberley Auditorium, however,
turned into a monologue. The students, faculty, staff
and workers — who developed the idea of the forum
and worked to carry it out — took this opportunity to
present their views very seriously. Indeed, they were
well prepared to speak on and to the issues raised.
The members of the administration, on the other
hand, gave a performance which was minimal at best.
They did not address the issues at hand and avoided
any direct responses to questions which were asked.
They spoke of the future of the University, but
cautiously side-stepped the issues which concern this
University and the community at the present.
One can only assume that the administration agreed
to the forum merely as a token gesture, a means of
pacifying those who were critical of University policies.
The administration was not participating in a con
structive debate, but merely biding its time until the
scheduled two hours were over.
Nevertheless, the forum did serve to raise many sig
nificant issues. Members of the Stanford community

spoke of the need to establish a World Culture pro
gram at Stanford as well as to re-evaluate the Univer
sity's relationship to the Hoover Institution. The
United Stanford Workers made clear that more atten
tion must be given to the situation of the workers here
at Stanford. They pinpointed the grievance procedures
as a main area of concern. From the statements of the
workers, it also appears that the University's middle
management needs to be held more accountable for its
decisions and actions.
Students, faculty, workers and staff members have
shown their willingness to improve relations with the
administration and their commitment to improving the
quality of life and education at Stanford. Many of
them, however, are probably — and justifiably — very
frustrated at the lack of response and respect which has
been shown for their views and concerns.
We can only hope that despite the administration's
performance on Friday, the University will move to act
on the issues which were raised. Investigation of the
grievances voiced by the workers is one place to begin.
But this would only be a start. The administration
must also show its commitment to improving the
quality of life here at Stanford. One way to do this
would be to participate sincerely in a dialogue with the
members of this community and to actively address
areas of concern.
