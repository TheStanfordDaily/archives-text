You can help us
raise the colorectal
cancer cure rate.
When detected early, the
cure rate for colorectal cancer
is very high. That's why we
urge regular checkups for
men and women 50 and over.
Warning signs are a
change in bowel habits,
blood in the stool.
Your doctor can perform
the digital and procto exams,
and you take care of the stool
blood test at home.
Checkup Guidelines for
men and women over 50
without symptoms:
• digital exam annually
• stool blood test annually
• procto exam every 3 to 5
years after 2 negative
tests 1 year apart.
No one faces cancer alone.
