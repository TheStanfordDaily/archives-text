In November 1973, Cliff Shaw was stricken with
cancer.
Fortunately, it was detected early enough. And with
surgery, Cliff was able to continue living a healthy, active life.
There was a time when such a diagnosis was virtually
hopeless.
But today, cancer is being beaten. Over the years, we've
spent $500,000,000 in research. And we've made great
strides against many forms of cancer.
With early detection and treatment, the survival rate
for colon and rectal cancer can be as high as 75%. Hodgkin's
disease, as high as 74%. Breast cancer, as high as 90%.
Today, one out of two people who get cancer gets well.
Its a whole new ball game.
