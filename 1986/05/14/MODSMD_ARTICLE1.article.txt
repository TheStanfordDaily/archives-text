# Stanford divests stock worth $9,900
## Not enough, SOSA says 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's Board of Trustees vote
to divest of $9,900 in Newmont Min
ing holdings was seen by student
protesters here as a feeble attempt to
appease the Stanford community.
Protesters had hoped the trustees
would also vote to divest immediately
of the University's nearly $3.5 million
worth of shareholdings in
Schlumberger and $400,000 in Dia
mond Shamrock Petroleum.
Instead, the board voted to hold
those stocks, with the stipulation that
the University will divest of Diamond
Shamrock in October if the company
fails to move toward disposing its in
terest there.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, who met with members of the
community for an hour yesterday af
ternoon, said the board will also
divest of the University's holdings in
Schlumberger in the fall if the corpo
ration's policies and performance in
South Africa show no improvement.
