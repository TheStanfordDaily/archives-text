# Stanford divests stock worth $9,900
## Not enough, SOSA says 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's Board of Trustees vote
to divest of $9,900 in Newmont Min
ing holdings was seen by student
protesters here as a feeble attempt to
appease the Stanford community.
Protesters had hoped the trustees
would also vote to divest immediately
of the University's nearly $3.5 million
worth of shareholdings in
Schlumberger and $400,000 in Dia
mond Shamrock Petroleum.
Instead, the board voted to hold
those stocks, with the stipulation that
the University will divest of Diamond
Shamrock in October if the company
fails to move toward disposing its in
terest there.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, who met with members of the
community for an hour yesterday af
ternoon, said the board will also
divest of the University's holdings in
Schlumberger in the fall if the corpo
ration's policies and performance in
South Africa show no improvement.

the trustees' decisions.
As members of the Stanford com
munity and activists in the anti
apartheid movement, we are frankly
angry at the token gesture made by
the Board of Trustees with the vote to
divest of only $ 10,000 of stock of cor
porations that do business in South
Africa, out of nearly $4 million sug
gested by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility, and total divest
ment demanded by a vast majority of
the student body," the statement
said.
"Had the board voted to divest
from the proposed $4 million, we
would have tound it significant, but
insufficient, given the nearly $150
million worth of South Africa stock
we now hold. However, we can only
take this present pitiful attempt to ap
pease the Stanford community as an
insult to those of us concerned here
and as a continuation of the crime
against those struggling for liberation
in South Africa."
Kennedy took notes while the
statement was read, and responded
immediately afterward.
"I don't believe it is an insult to this

community," Kennedy said. But he
added, "I can understand your disap
pointment with the size of the begin
ning."
Divestment is a "slow process," he
said.
Kennedy reiterated his justification
for evaluating companies on an indi
vidual basis and selectively divesting
only after attempting a "serious effort
to change corporate policy."
Kennedy said he disagrees strongly
with SOSA's claim that his adminis
tration "refuses to be concerned with
the community it governs."
"I simply don't believe that's true,"
he said. "With respect to accountabil
ity, I think our record is very good."
Kennedy noted that the trustees
must act "for the future," even if that
means, at times, acting against "what
appears to be the majority of one or
more constituencies that is here
now."
Senior Donna Anderson called the
move to divest of Newmont Mining
an "almost ridiculously tiny step,"
and asked Kennedy how long it
would be before Stanford adopts a
policy of total divestment.
"At this point, I think our best
course is an aggressively pursued
selective divestment policy," Ken
nedy responded.

SOSA, in its statement, said it will
"continue to struggle to make the
Board of Trustees and Mr. Kennedy
accountable to their constituency."
SOSA said it will consider estab
lishing an alternative alumni donation
fund "to be used until Stanford shows
significant initiative to divest."
After the meeting with Kennedy,
SOSA members argued over how
best to continue the struggle for di
vestment.
Senior Paula Groves, student rep
resentative to the Board of Trustees'
Special Committee on Investments,
said she felt the trustees had been
receptive to SOSA's demands and
had made a constructive decision. She
asked students to work through the
"proper channels," suggesting that
they meet with the trustees individu
ally.
The 60 students at the meeting
filed out as Groves attempted to
maintain their interest. Senior Joel
Bellenson yelled "bullshit" at her.
Anderson defended Groves, saying
that there are a "core of trustees who
are movable."
Senior Steve Phillips tried to bridge
the gap by telling the SOSA members
who favor strong actions against the
administration that "all means are
justifiable."
