# Alum tapped for ambassador
## 
### ERIC HEALY Senior staff writer 
President Reagan has nominated Harold
Shlaudeman, Stanford '52, to be the new U.S. ambas
sador to Brazil.
"I've already been nominated by the president. It's
not official until I've been cleared by the Senate, but it
is public knowledge," Shlaudeman told The Daily yes
terday.
Shlaudeman was recently approved by the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. The committee must
approve all nominations made by the president before
the Senate can vote on a proposed appointee.
"I am very pleased and honored to receive the nom

ination. I'm delighted that the president chose me," he
said.
If appointed, Shlaudeman will live in the U.S. em
bassy in Brazil. An ambassador serves "generally for
three years, although it's at the pleasure of the presi
dent. You stay as long as he wants you to," he said.
Assessing his qualifications for the job, he noted, "I
am the senior specialist on Latin America in the State
Department."
Since joining the State Department in 1955,
Shlaudeman has held the ambassadorships to
Venezuela, Peru and Argentina, respectively, as well
as such key positions as assistant secretary of State for
Latin America and, most recently, special envoy to
Central America.
