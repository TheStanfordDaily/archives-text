# Feminist fellowship founded
## 
### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
A recently established dissertation
fellowship in feminist and gender
studies should help to make up for
Stanford's lack of a graduate feminist
studies program, according to
Elizabeth Traugott, vice provost and
dean of Graduate Studies.
The fellowship will provide
graduate registration fees and a
$9,000 stipend to a student who has
completed all requirements for a doc
toral degree except the dissertation in

any of Stanford's doctoral programs.
The student should be in an advanced
stage of research for his or her disser
tation, which must either examine the
construction of gender roles in soci
ety, analyze women's experiences and
assumptions about these experiences
or be written from a feminist theory
perspective.
Traugott said the fellowship has
been established both to strengthen
Stanford's feminist studies program
by extending its scope on the
graduate level, and to support Stan
ford's Center for Research on

Women.
"I hope the [recipient] will be
closely associated with the center,"
Traugott said.
Traugott stressed that the fellow
ship is not designed for women alone,
in either its focus or its applicant
pool. The dissertation may deal with
either feminist studies or gender
studies, which involves the construc
tion of male and female sexual roles
in society. When asked if she thought
there would be any males applying
for the fellowship, Traugott said she
"expects some to do so."
