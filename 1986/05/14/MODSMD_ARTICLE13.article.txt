Acquired immune deficiency syndrome claims more
and more lives each year, and Stanford's leadership in
fighting the disease — and in educating the community
about its effects — commands respect.
• Last January, the program in human biology spon
sored several days of programming aimed at dispelling
popular misconceptions about AIDS. Topics included
AIDS and schoolchildren, minorities and AIDS and
psychological responses to the disease.
• Last week, members of the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS) staged a week of events de
signed to educate the community about AIDS and safe
sex.
• Last Wednesday the University published a policy
that extended Stanford's non-discriminatory hiring
policy to AIDS.
• And last Saturday, University President Donald
Kennedy hosted a benefit that organizers say raised
over $30,000 for AIDS education and research.
The University's new hiring policy protects the
privacy of employees, stating that Stanford will not ask
applicants if they have AIDS, will not require testing
for AIDS, and will not transfer a current employee on

the basis of fear of a co-worker having AIDS. This
policy is consistent with the University's non
discriminatory policy in general: transferring an em
ployee who is afraid of contracting AIDS from his co
worker is just as discriminatory as if his co-worker
were black.
The significance of the University's policy is as far
reaching as the money the benefit raised. Hundreds of
businesses and public school districts nationwide have
succumbed to hysterical fear of a disease they do not
understand and actively discriminate against AIDS vic
tims. Believed to be the first of its kind at a major Uni
versity, Stanford's non-discriminatory policy can now
act as a model for other institutions.
It is time that we realize that AIDS is not exclusively
a homosexual issue. It is a disease that kills adults and
children, gays and straights. Combating AIDS will take
money, but it will also take education to alleviate ho
mophobia — education such as the programs devised
by GLAS. Solving the AIDS problem will only take
place when people care enough to listen about protect
ing themselves and others against AIDS.
