Campus housing
needs upgrading
The results of then' st round of the
Draw were invariably the main topic
of conversation at dinner tables
around campus Monday night. Un
fortunately. I sensed that the mood in
most of these conversations was not
one of glee, but of sad resignation.
Few people were assigned to the
residences they wanted, while an ap
pallingly large number were not as
signed anywhere at all.
It is a tragedy that at such a
renowned and — one cannot forget
— wealthy institution as Stanford, a
large proportion of the student body
is either dissatisfied with its housing
assignment, or is unable to live on
campus at all. At almost every other
elite private college or university,
housing is virtually taken for granted.
At Yale, for instance, housing is
guaranteed all four years, and the
most important housing issue is
whether one will be able to live in a
three-room triple or a four-room
triple. Such luxury is unheard of at
Stanford. Yale and other private
schools do not have significantly
larger endowments, nor do they
charge higher tuitions than Stanford.
But the University does not seem
to care at all. The administration is
constantly bragging about its great
fund-raising success and its new $250
million science complex. While I ap
plaud the construction of this
complex and appreciate its impor
tance to the University's reputation in
the sciences, 1 wonder how many stu
dents it will benefit. Certainly not as
many as could benefit from the con
struction of a few new dormitories at
a much lower cost. Stanford is for
tunate enough to have a lot of land

and money, so why doesn't it show
some concern for its students (rather
than its reputation) and build a few
new residence halls? Students
deserve to be a little happier about
where they are living next year.

New Tresidder
not up to snuff
Can anything be done to persuade
the Tresidder Union cafeteria people
to bring their standards up to where
they were before the mass
merchandise lot took over?
In place of the useful, custom
made sandwiches we once could or
der, we now are expected to pay
fancy prices for such weird concoc
tions as "fugita" and "stir-fry"
messes that are both overpriced and
unappealing. In recent days I have
had to take back cooked pork that
was very pink, burritos that were
stone-cold and a so-called breast of
chicken that was simply a warmed-up
cold cut.
Instead of the nourishing soups we
once were offered, we now have con
gealed and revolting liquids that seem
to be warmed up day after day.
To add insult to many injuries, the
cafeteria people insist on posting self
satisfied replies to alleged well
wishers — I suspect these originate in
the cafeteria office.
My own complaints to the Tresid
der people have gone completely un
answered. Surely, there must be a
contract of acceptable service to
which these people can be held.
