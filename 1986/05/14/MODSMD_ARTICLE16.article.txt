## 'Viability' of fetus is difficult to define 
### 
Why should one artificially extend the life of a
patient when one is aware that the person will not
recover from the coma? Should the right to die be
restricted? Why should we care about a human
fetus that is not able to survive on its own?
These apparently different questions, which are
at the center of several important debates, have
one thing in common: they appeal to the concept of
viability. One possible answer to these questions,
one that has been sustained by several people,
might be "No, we should not care about life
whenever it is not viable, be it a patient in an ir
reversible state of coma or a recently conceived
embryo incapable of surviving alone."

Given this type of argument, it is important to
know exactly what viability means, since many of
our decisions on issues concerning life depend on
the definition of this concept.
Suppose a certain medical treatment allows a pa
tient about to die to survive two more weeks. Does
this mean that this patient's life is viable through
medical treatment? Clearly the answer to this ques
tion depends on individual value judgments,
namely whether one considers two weeks to be a
relevant period to make it worth "saving a life.*'
What if. instead of two weeks, it were two seconds,
or two years? It seems reasonable to assume one's
answer would change according to the length of this
period. Therefore viability depends on technology,
one of the main factors affecting the length of that
period.
According to Norman Frost, director of the pro
gram of medical ethics at the University of Wiscon
sin. "viability is the capacity of an organism to
survive for a designated period of time in a defined
environment." It could not be more vague, but it
could not be more precise either. It is difficult to
propose an exact definition of viability. Such a defi
nition is modified by our assignment of a period or
manner of independent survival, which may change

with time, place and individual values.
Given the subjectivity in the definition of
viability, it seems unreasonable to use it as an abso
lute criterion in judging policy issues as important
as those mentioned above. It is as if there were laws
saying "You should pay taxes if you think it will in
crease social welfare," or "The speed limit is that
speed above which you would find a high incidence
of accidents." No stable democracy could be sus
tained with such subjective laws. The more impor
tant an issue is, the better defined the criteria and
rules have to be. And one cannot find a more im
portant issue than the life and death of human
beings.
This does not mean that the concept of viability
is irrelevant. As Frost points out, it plays an impor
tant role in clinical decision-making. Suppose the
family of a patient is to decide whether to allow the
use of extraordinary means for the patient's sur
vival. The opinion of a doctor concerning the
viability of such a patient is an important element
for the family to consider, for it is an expert's tech
nical assessment of the possibilities of the patient's
survival. But it is also a personal judgment of what
viability really means. It should be taken as both an
expert and personal statement.
Another important instance of the application of
viability is in the premature births of newborns.
These infants' chances of survival are dependent on
the time of gestation. Typically, survival is possible
for an infant heavier than one-and-a-half pounds
or over 24 weeks old. The possibility of survival
decreases down to the weight of one pound and to
the age of 20 weeks. In general, complications arise
as the age of the infant decreases. In these cases the
decision depends greatly on the experience of the
physician and on the equipment and resources
available. No hard and fast rule for these cases can
be given.
The concept of viability is also applied to a living
fetus resulting from abortion. The same difficulties
arise as above for the premature infant, but with
the added complication that the fetus was not
meant to survive the operation. For example, take

the case of a 20-week-old premature infant and a
20-week-old aborted, but living, fetus. The only
difference in this instance may be the intent of the
doctor making the decision. In one case the deci
sion is likely to save the infant, in the other the
decision is likely to be different.
In the specific case of fetal survival, phrases such
as "self-sustaining life" and "ability to live inde
pendently" are commonly employed. However,
these do not fit the bill — any young child would fit
equally well into these categories. Even a young
child cannot live independently of warmth, food
and physical aid. This indicates that the notion of
viability is not applicable in this instance. The fact
that the fetus is fully viable inside the mother's
womb also seems to point to an incorrect usage of
the term "viability."
In the 1973 Supreme Court Roe vs. Wade deci
sion to legalize abortion, "viability" was used to
define the age up to which abortion would be per
mitted freely. Restrictions on abortions were
imposed in cases in which the fetus was over 24
weeks old. It is strange that the court would use
this argument. Essentially, it says that if the fetus is
viable outside the womb — that is, "able to live in
dependently" — then the woman must continue to
carry it. It is also possible that because technology
continues to push back the qualifying age of
viability. Roe vs. Wade may eventually become an
anti-abortion law!
In summary, it appears that viability is a neces
sary and useful concept, with applications in the
theory and practice of clinical medicine. Two of
those areas are situations involving the terminally
ill and the treatment of newborns. The usefulness
of this concept in the difficult arena of the abortion
debate seems to be limited.
