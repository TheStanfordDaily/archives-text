# Stockman reveals high-level hypocrisy
## 
### 
After all the media hoopla about former budget
director David Stockman's new book, "The Tri
umph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution
Failed," what surprised me most about the book is
that the author presents himself as such a conserva
tive.
I suppose I expected that a reasonably intelligent
person who recognized what a failure Reagan has
been would naturally drift toward liberalism.
Stockman certainly has it in his background: he
dodged the draft during the Vietnam War by be
coming a divinity student (and anti-war activist) at
Harvard. And while in the Reagan Administration,
Stockman was happy to be known as a
"pragmatist" fighting the "ideologues" of the far
right. (In Washington, it is more fashionable to be a
"pragmatist" than an "ideologue")

In his book, however, Stockman maintains that
he is and was a "true conservative" and a
"thinker," as opposed to the "politicians" who sold
out the Reagan Revolution and caused it to fail.
(Stockman, despite five years as a Capitol Hill aide,
four years as a congressman and four years in the
Reagan Administration, tells us that he was not
himself a "politician.")
In his new persona as a "true conservative,"
Stockman appears to be positioning himself for a
return to national office, to resurrect the failed
revolution. (When obtaining campaign money from
Republican fundraisers, it is more fashionable to be
a "true conservative" than a "pragmatist.") Stock
man raises hypocrisy to a new level: he explains op
position to the Vietnam War — an opposition he
shared until he was too old for the draft — as the
result of "Marxism and America-hating."
But what is more appalling about Stockman's
book is his description on page after disheartening
page of how the Reagan Administration lied to the

American public about its economic program.
During the 1980 campaign, Stockman realized that
his former mentor John Anderson was right, that it
would not be possible to cut domestic spending
enough to offset Reagan's proposed tax cuts and
defense increases.
By the time of the inauguration in 1981, the
entire Reagan economic team realized that their
proposed economic plan would lead not to their
promised goal of a balanced budget, but to deficits
three times as large as those of their Democratic
predecessors. Everyone in the Administration who
had any idea what was going on (according to
Stockman, this category excludes President Reagan
himself) agreed that such deficits would be a
catastrophe for the country.
What did the Reagan team do? Did they take the
course of civic virtue, admit they had been wrong
and adjust their proposals accordingly? No. They
cooked the books. They lied with statistics. They
hid the deficit and denied it existed. The most
amazing part of the story is that no one in the entire
Administration even suggested that they do the
right thing and tell the American people the truth.
The only concern anyone around Reagan had was
to make their package as politically attractive as
possible. Nobody ever considered sacrificing politi
cal expediency for sound policy.
Of course, it may be overly idealistic to hold
every politician to the Jimmy Carter "I will never
lie to you" standard. When dealing with foreign na
tions less free than ourselves, complete candor may
not always make for wise statesmanship. Indeed,
the Reagan Administration has fed us a steady
stream of white lies and half-truths from Lebanon
to Libya and Nicaragua to Nambia. But the con
spiracy of falsehood which Stockman details is dif
ferent. The budget lies were for purely domestic
consumption, and they were not made to promote
sound policy, but for the sole purpose of preserving
political popularity.
These lies were not isolated responses to unex
pected questions, but a coordinated, actively
promoted fraud which the Adminstration per
petrated on the people as a matter of policy. And
the result is that for the next 20 years, Americans
will have to pay not only for their current
governmental needs, but also for the needs of the
1980s which Reagan refused to pay for.

Stockman has his own rationalization for why he
went along with the budget fraud. He now says he
privately hoped that big budget deficits would pro
vide the leverage needed to cut popular social pro
grams (like Medicaid) which Stockman himself
didn't like, but which Reagan had promised to
preserve. Stockman describes as the "triumph of
politics" the fact that almost none of these pro
grams have in fact been eliminated.
Here, too, his candor is doubtful. Stockman pro
vides no support for his assertion that he ever had
such a private dream, and his entire career be
speaks a political shrewdness that makes it unlikely
that he could have so misjudged the political
chances that this dream would come true. More
likely, Stockman went along with policies he knew
were wrong because he was so intoxicated with

The Reagan Administra
tion has fed us a steady
stream of white lies and
half-truths. . . .

power that he could not bear to leave. Even if
Stockman's account of his own personal motives is
accurate, it betrays an appalling lack of faith in the
American people and their capacity to make in
formed political choices.
The pattern of deceit which Stockman details is
only a part of the larger moral blindness of Ameri
can conservatism. The Reagan Administration has
already had more of its members resign in scandal
and disgrace than even the Nixon Administration.
This is to say nothing of Reagan's callousness to the
hungry, the homeless and the dispossessed. The
Reagan Administration spends a lot of time talking
about law and order and conventional morality, but
it spend very little time actually practicing either.
The question I am left with is this: What is it about
rich old white male Republicans that makes them
think they don't have to play by ths same rules they
enforce on the rest of us?
