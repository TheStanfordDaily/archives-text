### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
Lucille and David Packard have pledged
$70 million to help finance construction of a
comprehensive new pediatric facility at the
Stanford Medical Center.
The gift includes a pre-vious Packard
pledge of $20 million for the project, ap
proved yesterday by the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
The donation is the single largest commit
ment made to the University by a private
donor, s* 'passing last month's $50 million
gift from William Hewlett to Stanford's
forthcoming Centennial campaign.
David Packard and Hewlett, Stanford
alumni and co-founders of Hewlett-Packard
Co., are chairman and vice chairman of the
computer and electronics company,
respectively. Stanford alumna Lucille Pack
ard is chairman of the board of the
Children's Hospital and vice chairman of the
board planning the New Children's Hospital
at Stanford.
Of the Packard's $70 million, $40 million
will cover part of the design, planning, con
struction and equipment costs of the new
hospital; $22 million will go to Stanford
Hospital's modernization project, including
perinatal facilities; and $8 million will be
used to modernize pediatric academic space
at the Medical School.

The terms of the pledge require the Uni
versity to pursue a $20 million development
program lor the New Children's Hospital as
part of the medical center's fund-raising
agenda. The total cost of the new hospital is
exacted to exceed $60 million.
The Packard gift "will enablp
sity to embark on a partnership with the
Children's Hospital at Stanford in establish
ing one of the foremost comprehensive
centers for pediatric care, research and
training in the country," University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy told the Medical
Center News Bureau.
"It's in pediatrics that medicine faces its
most exciting challenges," Kennedy said.
"Each child born with a birth defect or in
curable disease exemplifies the need for fur
ther knowledge. A better understanding of
the causes of illness, better ways of detec
tion, treatment and prevention will result in
dramatic changes in the quality of life," he
said.
Because these improvements span a
lifetime, "investments in the health of
children are very powerful," Kennedy
added.
Planning of the new 125-bcd hospital is
directed by a recently appointed 20-member
board of directors chaired by Dr. Lawrence
Crowley, a former Stanford vice presi
dent for Medical Affairs.
To be designed by the San Francisco ar
chitectural firm of Anshen and Allen, the

facility will be attached to Stanford Hospi
tal's new Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine that is scheduled to open next
year. Construction of the New Children's
Hospital will begin soon afterward, with
completion scheduled for early 1989.
new hospital will be an integral part
of "the Medical Center, but its governance
and management structure will be separate
and independent in accordance with agree
ments between the- University and the
Children's Hospital approved yesterday by
the trustees.
The new facility will be the Medical
School's principal hospital for clinical
practice, research and teaching relating to
pediatrics.
The Stanford Hospital and the Children's
Hospital for many years have been operat
ing their complementary pediatric programs
from several locations. Many patients at the
Children's Hospital now must be shuttled
across the street to the Stanford Hospital for
surgery or special treatment.
The new three-story building will consoli
date these programs in one area. It also will
house the Stanford Children's Ambulatory
Care Center and will include a 150-seat au
ditorium, a cafeteria and support services
ranging from clinical laboratories and physi
cal therapy to diagnostic radiology.
The future of the Children's Hospital is
still unknown and is being discussed by
several University committees.
