# Dean Jean discusses admissions machine

### FELICIA PAIK Senior staff writer 
"The admissions process is an all
consuming process. It is a monastic existence
.. . it tends to overwhelm all parts of your
life," according to Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter.
Applying to college is a serious, nerve
wracking process not only for the applicant,
but also for the staffers in the admissions of
fice, Fetter told the Stanford Mothers' Club
yesterday.
This year the Admissions Office received
16,135 applications, the second highest
number of applications the University has
ever received.
Each application is read three times. First,
the application is read by one of the 12 direc
tors on staff. This person reads the entire ap
plication and writes an evaluative paragraph
on the individual, according to Fetter.
He or she then gives a preliminary recom
mendation of "admitted," "not admitted" or
"swim," which is considered the hold cate
gory.
The application is read a second time by
another director, and the third reading is
done by Fetter and John Bunnell, director of
Freshman Admissions.
This year, after initial readings of the
9,000 most promising candidates, 1,500 stu

dents were admitted. Five thousand were
designated "not admitted." And the remain
ing 2,500 were put in the "swim" category.
"On the first pass we admitted 1,500,
which is one out of 10 applicants. This num
ber was reached by March 14," Fetter said.
The remaining applicants were chosen out
of the "swim" category. These applications
are read three times more.
Twenty-five hundred applicants were of
fered admission in early April in order to
guarantee a freshman class of 1,500, Fetter
said.
The criteria for selection is determined by
the Committee of the Faculty Senate, which
includes eight faculty members and three
students.
"Demonstrated intellectual capacity and
evidence of personal achievement are the
two main criteria for admission," Fetter said.
A third criterion of "persistence in an ef
fort" may be added for next year's appli
cants, she said.
"The admissions process is an imperfect
art. We are doing our job with integrity;
however, we are not infallible. There needs
to be an inherent trust in the process," she
said.
Fetter emphasized the subjective aspect of
the process. Each application is considered
individually â€” there are no quotas or cutoff
scores for the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
