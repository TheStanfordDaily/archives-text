Who hasn't heard of the
Brazilian Carnaval? A week
long hedonistic extravaganza
fueled by the invigorating beat of
samba and the energy of the people,
Carnaval serves as an outlet for all
the frustrations that build up during
the year. It is seven days of free-for
all fun and dancing when the only
rule is to leave all worries behind in
the explosion of joy.
Carnaval — like its counterpart,
Mardi Gras — evolved from Catholic
traditions, but the religious nature of
the event has faded over the years.
Carnaval is still a purging of the spirit,
but in dance, not repentance.
Few people know, however, that
the Brazilian Carnaval is also a long
lost tradition at Stanford that will be
reborn Saturday from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
at the Bechtel International Center.
The Brazilian Carnaval Ball at
Stanford was first organized in 1968
by Maria Bun, director of the Office
for International Visitors at Stanford
and a Carnaval enthusiast from
Brazil. "Maria's Carnaval," as it was
known, was a smashing success for 10
years, attracting large numbers of stu
dents, faculty and staff.
The Brazilian Carnaval Ball was
first held at the I-Center but was
forced to move to Roble Gym as the
crowds swelled to upwards of 1,000
people. In 1977 a record 1,200 atten
ded and the proceeds were donated
to the "Amigos de las Americas"
program, which sponsored students
working in immunization and rural
projects in Latin America.
In 1978 and 1979, graduate stu
dent Sergio Eston took over the reins
and decided to organize a Brazilian
Week featuring the participation of
the Brazilian musical and folkloric
group "Corpo Santo." Aside from
the Carnaval Ball, now held at
Maples Pavilion, other activities in
cluded "capoeira" (a Brazilian mar
tial art) demonstrations, lectures and
films. Bira Almeida, Corpo Santo's
leader, still teaches capoeira at Stan
ford.
But organizing the Carnaval Ball
came to be a tremendous undertaking
as the event grew in size. Seven years
passed before the Brazilian Students

Association (BSA) decided to reor
ganize the Brazilian Cultural Week
with the Carnaval Ball again featured
as the final event. To ensure its suc
cess, the BSA hired what is perhaps
the best samba band in the Bay Area:
Brasil Ja (Brazil Now).
The band's fame comes from its
great success at Galleria night club's
Carnaval Ball last February in San
Francisco. The band gave Stanford a
taste of its vigorous samba music by
rocking Tresidder Union yesterday.
In addition to the band, profes
sional samba dancers dressed in typi
cal Carnaval costumes will perform at
the Ball, most notably Marlene, who
leads a 500-member samba club in
San Francisco. Two of the dancers
also unexpectedly thrilled yesterday's
Tresidder crowd with an inpromptu
performance. Dressed in exuberant
Carnaval costumes they selected ran
dom members of the audience
to try their hand at samba. Others
were quickly lured by Brasil Ja's beat
and joined the dance as passers-by
crowded around the Tresidder patio
to watch the scene.
Bun still helps out with the organi
zation of the Carnaval Ball and is per
haps the one who most eagerly awaits
the resurrection of the event.
"I'm very happy to see that we're
going back to the traditional Carnaval
Ball and that the BSA — with the

help of ASSU, STARTS and Latin
American Studies — is bringing back
to Stanford this happy event. The
Carnaval Ball is very unique as it
brings together faculty, staff, grad
uates and undergraduates who come
"jump" (a term for samba danc
ing) and celebrate spring and the
traditional Brazilian spirit."
Indeed, the spirit of Carnaval and
the beat of samba seem to transcend
all barriers: age, culture, race, social
class and perhaps the toughest barrier
of all, apathy. Few can resist the
excitement. The usually subdued
Prince Charles, for one, was once
seen (and filmed) dancing wildly at a
Rio de Janeiro Carnaval bash, tuxedo
and all.
Once I witnessed an elderly Ameri
can couple undergo a bizarre trans
formation at a Rio Carnaval ball. At

first they sat passively watching the
crowd frolic frantically to the seismic
beat of the samba drums (samba
bands are measured on the Richter
Scale). A second look a few minutes
later revealed the couple dancing a
mixture of hula and Charleston on
top of a table. It was as if they had
found the fountain of youth at the
bottom of their bottles of Perrier.
According to Bun, Saturday's ball
will consist of no-nonsense "free-for
all dancing." No previous knowledge
of samba is required. As co-organizer
Gersem Andrade from BSA put it,
"Carnaval is a state of spirit. It is a
time to get rid of pressures, tensions
and simply be yourself. There are no
labels, there are no rules. There is
just samba. It doesn't matter if you
don't know the steps of the dance . . .
just let instinct take over."

It is the tradition to wear costumes
to Carnaval balls, and the BSA will
be awarding prizes to the prettiest
and ugliest specimens. Bun recom
mends wearing "anything, your old
grandmother's clothes, anything you
want," but stresses that those dressed
in civilian outfits will not be barred.
"The important thing is to come."
Tickets, on sale at BASS ($5 for
Stanford students, faculty and staff,
$7 otherwise) or at the door, entitle
the bearer to various surprises.
Don't worry about homeworlT.
Your profs will be there too.
The Brazilian Cultural Week has
other events scheduled for tomorrow

Brazilian consul in San Francisco, will

Center on "Democracy in Brazil:
New Economic, Social, and Financial
Plans." Also scheduled for tomorrow

On Friday there will be a slide
