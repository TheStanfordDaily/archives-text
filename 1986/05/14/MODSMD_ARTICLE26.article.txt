## Journey through a microscopic world 
### 
Technology is more than applied science. The materials
and processes that fashion modern electronics produce a
microscopic landscape rich in images and colors largely
hidden from the naked eye.
It is a world in which thousands of components and cir
cuit paths describe an elaborate mosaic on a silicon chip
no larger than a thumbnail; optical fibers show their com
plex inner structure in bands of polarized light; and sub
stances magnified many times their original size appear to
assume new identities.
"Microscapes: the Hidden Art of High Technology," a
major photomicrography exhibition which focuses on the
seldom-seem world of advanced developments in
microelectronics software and lightwave communications,
is on view through June 17 at Stanford's Center for Inte
grated Systems and in the Dean's Office area of Terman
Engineering Center.
Prepared by AT&T, "Microscapes" is on a three-year
tour of the United States. The unique exhibition
premiered at the Chicago Museum of Science and Indus
try in celebration of that institution's 50th anniversary and
has just come to Stanford from the California Museum of
Science and Industry in Los Angeles.
Composed of 50 dramatic photographs, "Microscapes"
represents some of the current processes used in the re
search, development and production of advanced com
munications systems. Some of the photographs are the
results of the exploration in materials sciences that are in
tegral to the technologies involved in communications sys
tems development.
The photographs are large-format color and black-and
white works that employ such advanced photographic
techniques as photomacrography, photomicrography, in
terferometry, thermography and light polarization, which
together constitute a technology of their own.
Photomacrography is a process that makes moderately
magnified photographs of minute subjects through a com
pound microscope.
Photomicrography, or scanning electron micrography,
uses a beam of electrons to scan the exterior surface of an
object, which then releases its own secondary electrons.
These are collected to create a detailed three-dimensional
image.
Interferometry involves splitting a light source into two
beams, then recombining them on photographic film.
When a disturbance, such as a shock wave, occurs in the
path of one of these beams, it changes the phase with
respect to the second, reference, beam. This creates inter

ference effects that will be recorded when the beams are
recombined.
Polarization is the term used to describe the process of
polarizing a light wave. Instead of vibrating in all direc
tions, light is passed through polarizing filters to limit the
vibration to one plane. Two polarizers can be used to ex
amine specimens by producing color and contrast.
Thermography is a technique for imaging variations in
the amount of infrared radiation, or heat, emitted by a
subject. This process can record temperature differences
within a fraction of a degree.
Strange and colorful landscapes, rich in shapes, textures
and hues which are hidden from the naked eye are
revealed in the Microscape photographs. Microprocessor
chips, glass fibers, crystals and magnetic bubbles come to

life as distant objects of fascinating designs and beauty. So
advanced are the photographic techniques involved that
some of the photos were shot at exposure speeds of
1/720,000 of a second, and with magnifications of up to
67,000 times the actual image size. The majority of the
photographs were shot using Kodachrome or Ektachrome
film.
"Microscapes" was designed by Louis Nelson As
sociates of New York.
The Center for Integrated Systems, located at the inter
section of Campus Drive and Via Palou, is open for
viewing the exhibition from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. Mondays
through Fridays. The Dean's Office of Terman Engineer
ing Center at the corner of Sam Morris Way and Santa
Teresa Street is open during the same hours.

A laser has drilled a hole in a silicon wafer by heating and almost instantly vaporizing the material. The
silicon vapor quickly condensed and resolidified on the wafer as tiny drops.
