# Dancing ions sing in space

### 
At the boundary of Earth and space, the last scat
tered bits of atmosphere mingle in a magnetic dance
that can turn pure radio tones into a smear of static.

Weak radio signals are amplified by the charged
particles bound to Earth's magnetic field, Stanford
radioscientist Robert Helliwell showed previously.
Now he has found that radio energy fed into the
magnetosphere can resonate into new frequency
combinations.
"It means the medium is nonlinear," Helliwell
said. "If you excite it in one way, you get something
different in return."
The ability of the magnetosphere to create non
sense from coherent signals suggests that much of
radio "noise" is in fact a hash of originally distinct
radio events.
Most radio static, Helliwell explained, is the
reverberation of distant lightning.
"Truly random noise in nature," he added, "is
hard to find."
Helliwell studies the way that the magnetosphere
mixes radio signals in order to learn more about this
farthest extension of Earth in space. The "medium"
of the magnetosphere, plasma, is a captive combi
nation of oppositely charged, subatomic fragments
called ions.
In the past two years, Helliwell and colleagues
have analyzed how the magnetosphere can take two
pure radio signals and turn them into multifre
quency noise. They send weak signals into the mag
netosphere from a radio antenna mounted atop a
miles-thick ice sheet in the Antartic highlands.
The radioscientists found that the single fre
quency of each signal gets mixed by the magneto
sphere to form "side bands." Two radio waves dif
fering in frequency by 20 hertz, for instance,
generate new waves of lower and higher frequen
cies, all separated by 20 hertz.
But since each "beat" in the resulting radio
rhythm triggers another new set of signals, Helliwell
said, the frequencies "begin to drift until (they) no
longer line up with the generated signals."
The side bands, he said, smear into noise.
