# ASSU TEEN BEAT
## MENUDO UPDATE 
### 
What Stanford needs is a good place to get some. Now that the DUs are
out the door, where can you go to get drunk, violent, and abusive of the
opposite sex? Well, you can't go to the ASSU dance hall. Because we don't
have an ASSU Dance Hall. But we might. Random students (random stu
dents are great, because they're so unpredictable) have told us, "Look,
take an empty room, toss a couple thousand (ten thousand?) dollars of
sound and lights into it, hire a KZSU DJ to spin some dance tunes (if they
know any), and it's a party. Go for it." Sounds good to us (as long as its
someone else's thousands of dollars).
Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, maybe? Couple thousand watts
pounding non-Madonna sound in a vortex of contorting flesh? Could be
good, especially if we could a) gel a liquor license, or b) operate without
one. No, really: even without one, it'd beat the hell out of aerobics or
folkdancing at the Old Clubhouse. What do you think? Is it worth a try?
Give us a call, 723-4331, or 326-3473.
