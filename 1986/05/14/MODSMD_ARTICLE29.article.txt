# Get Winning Skin
## 
### 
At your age, skin care's no picnic. II you aren't fretting about that pimple that in
conveniently planted itself on your chin, you're fighting a fruitless battle with the
ASSU that leaves your skin dry and chaps your face. But the year's over, and you're
passing through puberty, maybe for the third time, and you don't have to worry
about the ASSU anymore.
Student group leaders: don't leave without telling your successors the score.
Don't leave without explaining how to keep the ASSU and other university
bureaucracies from infecting their pores and causing'the big, sharp pointy ones on
the forehead, or the rash of small ones all around the temple and down the cheeks.
Some people get pimples on their shoulders, chest and back. Yuck. Then they're too
embarrassed to change into their gym clothes in the locker room. Then they hang
themselves. Good riddance.
Maybe you spent this year getting your group's act together. Don't let the people
who take your place make the same mistakes. Tell them stuff that will help them
work well. Things like:
1. "Work well."
2. "Don't sneeze on your pants."
3. "Everything you know is wrong."
4. "Go to Hell."
5. "Thank you, Amadeus."
6. "You better work well, because the ASSU will try to dork you anyway."
Things like that.


The only one Sean will make peace with is Madonna.
