When Bay Area radio listeners
tune into KZSU Stanford, 90.1 on
their FM dial, they probably aren't
aware that the station's 500 watts
of power emanate from a small
control room in the basement of
Memorial Hall.

They also might not be aware
that the entire KZSU staff, with
the exception of one engineer, is
made up of student volunteers.
Over 100 students work at the sta
tion.
"Everyone down there is
working [voluntarily]," explained
junior Vinnie Politan. who will

take over as KZSU program direc
tor on June 1.
As directors of a student-run or
ganization, KZSU managers
stressed the importance of its
ASSU fee assessment in covering
most of its operating costs. "We
don't have commercials, so we
really rely on the fee assessment,"
Politan said.
Because both parts of the
KZSU fee assessment recently
were approved in the ASSU elec
tion, the station will continue to
operate as usual next year, and
will also be able to afford some
improvements.
The first part of the fee assess
ment allots between $45,000 and
$54,000 to KZSU. The more stu
dents who apply for ASSU rebates,
the less money KZSU will receive.
The second part of the fee assessment
— $9,000 — will be spent on some
technical improvements.
"It looks like an enormous amount
of money when you look at it at face
value, but we have to buy equipment
that's going to last in a commercial
setting," explained junior Scott Mar
tin, who will start his tenure as KZSU
station manager June 1. "It's expen
sive, but it's something that Stanford
students have shown they're willing
to pay for."
Some purchases that the KZSU
staff plans to make to improve the
station include a new reel-to-reel
tape deck, a new cassette player, car
peting for the studio and production
areas and a new record cleaner.
"All of the improvements that we
do are expensive, because it's
broadcast-quality radio equipment,"
Martin said.
Although KZSU might not have
the financial resources of a commer
cial station, Politan said he feels that
it can successfully meet the needs of
its listeners.
"Usually, we'll play a request
within 10 minutes," he said. "You
call up any commercial station and
make a request and they won't care.
We care, and we try to get it on."

And for any given song requested,
chances are that KZSU will have it in
stock.
"We have the largest record library
in the South Bay — upwards of
14,000 albums," Martin explained.
He noted that most commercial sta
tions have libraries of approximately
8,000 albums.
One reason for the large size of
KZSU's record library is that until
last fall, the station had never
adopted a format. "There wasn't a lot
of continuity from one DJ to the
next," Martin explained. "We found
that sort of unsatisfactory, so we've
changed to a more structured sort of
format."
Currently, KZSU continues to play
a wide variety of music, but the staff
has made an effort to consistently
play certain types of music during
specified time slots.
For example, KZSU plays reggae
on Saturday evenings, and classical
music on Sunday mornings. Other
musical categories include jazz,
"alternative currents," modern clas
sics, Chicano music and music for the
black community.
In addition to offering the commu
nity an alternative to commercial
radio, KZSU also offers Stanford stu
dents an opportunity to get some
hands-on broadcasting experience.
"The good thing about KZSU is
that you can walk in and we can

literally put you to work the first
day," Martin said.
The most sought-after positions at
KZSU are those of the disc jockeys.
However, it takes some training
before most volunteers can get on the
air.
"If you want to be a DJ, you have
to go through one quarter of train
ing," Politan explained.
Trainees meet weekly for training
sessions before getting some experi
ence on the radio. "It involves on
the-air training for one hour between
11 p.m. and 2 a.m. on Sunday and
Monday," said Adam Fogelson, a
freshman announcer.
Additionally, most first-time DJs
are assigned the "graveyard shift" —
2 to 6 in the morning.
"It's really an odd hour to be
working. You get a wide variety of
listeners at that hour," said Fogelson,
who co-hosts "Mo/Fo Way Early
Monday Morning Show with Jeff."
His co-hosts are freshman Jack
Moriarity and sophomore Jeff Silbert.
"Our listeners range from 13- to
14-year-olds to 40-year-olds who
work the night shift somewhere,"
Fogelson said. "We have some die
hard fans. You have to be pretty die
hard to listen at that hour."
Although being a DJ might be the
most popular job at KZSU, it cer

tainly isn't the only job at the station.
KZSU also has an extensive news de
partment.
"We put on five newscasts a day,
and we have about 36 people on our
news staff this year," Martin said.
"This year we get UPI wire service.
Next year we're switching to AP, and
we'll have audio and wire," Martin
explained. "We re-write everything
we get and try to expand upon it."
KZSU also prides itself on covering
campus news, Martin said. The sta
tion carried last January's speech by
South African Bishop Desmond Tutu
live, and broadcasts a weekly
"Campus Conference" interview pro
gram.
Next fall, the news staff hopes to
conduct interviews with congressional
candidates, according to Martin.
KZSU also has an active sports de
partment. "We broadcast Stanford
sports more than any station in the
area," Martin said.
Martin said he hopes more students
will come to visit KZSU, either to
find out about volunteer opportuni
, ties or just to see how the student-run
station operates.
"If people haven't seen the station,
J they should," he commented.
"Students should definitely see what
they're paying for."
