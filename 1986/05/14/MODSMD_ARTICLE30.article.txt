The new Council of Presidents is putting together groups to work
on the real issues. We've already put together groups to work on
the fake ones. Join with them — push an extra issue to the wall, or
beyond. Like, into the living room, even. Take your plans and
work with the new Council to make them happen. Join:
The World Culture Group — Convince the University to
move on a new academic program to teach the thoughts of
other cultures.
The Cosmo Culture Group — Thoughts of the people of
Neptune and of the Zoltron system are important, too.
ASSU Funding Analysis Group — Figure out a way for the
ASSU to give out money fairly. What the hell, you might as
well figure out a way to help the Kaiser win World War I.
Student Union Group — If Tresidder is rebuilt, will stu
dents be better or worse off in terms of control? Do
Frenchmen smell? Do armless children have hands? Work
with us to write an ASSU plan to add to the Union, or, per
haps, build a new one. Just like Al X proposed.
Labor Support Group — Plan programs to bring Stanford
workers and students together to learn from and enjoy each
other. Or maybe get really annoyed at each other, and beat
the living hell out of each other. Then the administration
won't have any troubles.
Affirmative Action Group — Find out if affirmative action
is really working at Stanford, and suggest ways to recruit
more students and faculty of diverse origins. Like professors
from the Yukon and students whose parents fish for a living.
University Committee Coordination Group — Create a
method to track students on University committees, give
them info, advice, and ensure their effectiveness.
