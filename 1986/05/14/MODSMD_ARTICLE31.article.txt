# Senate Reprimands Sean Penn
## 
### 
Some celebs are so stuck up! They think they can get away with just
anything. Well, someone has to show them what's what. That's what the
ASSU is here for. The Senate decided to reprimand candidates who didn't
obey our rules. Rules are important. Think what would happen if every
one broke the rules.
Reprimands were given to David Benwell, Kim Crawford and Vivian
Wu for the dastardly deed of posting their campaign flyers in the library.
That's against the rules! AAAAgh! One of them was in a bathroom. That
breaks two rules! Hang your heads in shame, nogoodniks.
The hearing committee considered these violations minor. They really
socked it to the bad guys. The Slate of Shock was censured (that's sort of
like a double reprimand) for spending $40 more than they should have.
They even spent more than Josh. They won.
Imagine this: Zenon Kuc ran for a Senate seat just so he would receive a
free flicks pass. He doesn't even know what movies are going to be shown
next quarter. He's a grad student. The plot thickens: You see, it's ok to run
for the Senate just because you want a free flicks pass (I'd do the same if I
had no friends to borrow one from, too). What you can't do is offer such a
person a flicks pass not to run. That's bribery. Robby Perkins tried to buy
Zenon a'flicks pass (he thought only individuals seriously concerned about
the issues should run for office). Robby got censured for bribery. Just like
Dragnet.
Zenon should have taken the flicks pass. Then he wouldn't have to sit
through Senate meetings. Anyone else who wants to send Zenon a flicks
pass: mail them to Help A Kuc, Crothers Memorial Box 679, Stanford.
Don't tell the Senate, though.
