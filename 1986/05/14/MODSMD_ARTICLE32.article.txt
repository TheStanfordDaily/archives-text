# WHAM!: GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN
## 
### 
The Police Advisory Board met at a public forum yesterday. No
they didn't. But students planning it did. This is what happened. I
hope it really did. We wrote this last week.
1. The Police Advisory Board is to be composed of two police,
one staff member, one Dean Lyons rep., at least one faculty,
George Michael of Wham!, up to six students, three Dollies and
Michael J. Fox.
2. The Board's major task is to do something about problems in
the community — help students, faculty, staff, cops. How? you
may ask. Shut up.
3. The Board would try to integrate (like calculus!) the police
and the community and inform everyone of police policies.
Politely.
4. The Board would make recommendations to each represented
constituency. Recommendations about what? I'm not allowed to
write it because we're supposed to pretend everyone is friends. It
has something to do with billy clubs smashing in innocent people's
heads, though.
5. The Board would publish pix and pin-ups of all your fave
Stanford Police Officers.
It will be a wonderful thing that will make everyone happy. Ex
cept the police. But we're not allowed to say that.
