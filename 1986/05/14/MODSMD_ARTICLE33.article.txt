# FADS 'N' FASHIONS

Did you see the way that hunk Eric Berg voted last week? And
the way the Senate voted to censure Robby Perkins? (I heard he
tried to bribe Zenon Kuc with tickets to the Pat Benatar concert!
Why would he give those hot tix away?! I sure am glad they
censured him; I want those tix.)
Oh, and remember how they extended the date of the Deßarge
concert because that creepy Lenny McUseless got trampled in the
refreshment line? Well, I heard the Senate extended the filing
deadline for declarations of intent to allow two write-in graduate
candidates (ewwww, graduate students, they're gross!) to become
senators. Did you see what Talbott Hoskins was wearing? Look!
Isn't that dreamy Michael Strange? I wonder how he voted?
