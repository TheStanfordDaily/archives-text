Dear TEEM BEAT,
I ABSOLUTELY ADORE Kirk Cameron of
Growing Pains. In the show he portrays ex
actly what a kid at the age of 15 or 16 are
like, except some kids are more mature
than that. I was hoping you could tell me
where I could write to him and give me
some info on him like his favorite things to
do. I sure would appreciate it. Thanxl

Dear TEEN BEAT,
I'm absolutely crazy about the Program Board! The first time I read how the
board can allot all that money to all those cuties on student organizations, I nearly
died. In fact, I did die, and I dug myself out just in time to read the latest fax on that
boffo board. I dig the program board, so would you please tell me what they've
been up to lately, and, also, what they are looking for in a twelve-year-old girl with
no future?

I'm absolutely crazy about the Program Board! The first time I read how the
board can allot all that money to all those cuties on student organizations, I nearly
died. In fact, I did die, and I dug myself out just in time to read the latest fax on that
boffo board. I dig the program board, so would you please tell me what they've
been up to lately, and, also, what they are looking for in a twelve-year-old girl with
no future?

Dear TEEM BEAT,
I ABSOLUTELY ADORE Kirk Cameron of
Growing Pains. In the show he portrays ex
actly what a kid at the age of 15 or 16 are
like, except some kids are more mature
than that. I was hoping you could tell me
where I could write to him and give me
some info on him like his favorite things to
do. I sure would appreciate it. Thanxl
