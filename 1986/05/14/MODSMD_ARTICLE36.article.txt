## Goldie, Grabb key to netters' hopes 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
In order to win consistently in col
legiate or professional tennis today,
you must have an attacking style of
play. Aggressive tennis, whether from
the baseline or from serve and volley,
is the key to winning matches against
high-caliber players.
Stanford seniors Dan Goldie, who

employs an aggressive return of serve
and powerful groundstrokes, and Jim
Grabb, known for an outstanding
serve and volley combination, repre
sent both attacking modes of tennis.
Both have had remarkable results
from their styles of play, proving their
value to the Cardinal team and pro
viding nationwide individual recogni
tion. Both will turn professional after
this season.

"They are both aggressive-type
players," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said." Dan has one of the most devas
tating returns of serve that I have
ever seen. Jim has a great serve and
volley game."
Both Goldie and Grabb made an
immediate impact at Stanford as
freshmen.
Goldie entered Stanford as the No.
28 junior in the nation, while Grabb

came in as the No. 48 junior. Both
played behind Cardinal standouts
Scott Davis and John Letts in 1982.
Goldie played No. 3 singles while
Grabb performed at No. 6.
Goldie improved steadily as the
year went along, and Grabb lost only
one match all year. As freshmen, they
helped the Cardinal win the NCAA
team championships.
"Winning the title as a freshman —

that was a thrill," Goldie said.
"They were instrumental in win
ning it that year," Gould added.
In their sophomore seasons, Goldie
moved to the No. 1 position and
Grabb moved up the singles ladder as
well. They led the Cardinal to the
NCAA finals, and each received All-
America recognition.
Goldie reached the quarterfinals in
the NCAA singles championships.
During the summer, he competed on
the U.S. Junior Davis Cup Team. In
addition, he won a silver medal at the
1984 World University Games in Al
berta, Canada. He also won the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Championships.
As juniors in,'i9Bs, Grabb and
Goldie really maae their mark. Al
though the team was ousted in the
quarterfinals by Georgia, both Goldie
and Grabb had very successful indi
vidual seasons.
Goldie was ranked No. 1 nationally
for much of the year. His 19-5 singles
record included a convincing victory
over eventual NCAA singles cham
pion Michael Pernfors. He was the fa
vorite to win the NCAA singles title.
In the NCAA individual cham
pionships, however, Goldie was upset
in the quarterfinals. He ended the
season ranked No. 2 in the nation.
Grabb also enjoyed a fine season.
Playing No. 2 singles, he compiled an
18-3 record. He reached the semi
finals in the NCAA singles cham
pionships. Grabb finished the year
right behind Goldie, at No. 3 in the
nation.
Both players won individual titles
as juniors. Goldie was the Pacific-1()
Conference singles and doubles
champion (with Eric Rosenfeld).
Grabb won the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships.
With this already substantial suc
cess, even greater things were ex
pected of Goldie and Grabb as
seniors.
However, both have been beset
with injuries during the 1986 season.
Grabb has been able to compete in
only 10 matches to date, while Goldie
played a few matches hurt and was
bothered by an ankle injury in the
beginning of the year.
Despite their injuries, both have
had relatively successful seasons.
Goldie finished the dual match
season with an 11-7 record and was
ranked eighth nationally, down from
last year's No. 2 ranking. Grabb has
an 8-2 record.

After four years on the Farm and one NCAA team championship, Jim this Saturday. The Cardinal's No. 2 player has been bothered by a
Grabb will be looking for another in this year's NCAAs which begin groin injury but has still managed to compile an 8-2 record.
"I have played a couple matches
hurt, and maybe I haven't competed
as well," Goldie said of the difference
between last year and this season.
Both Goldie and Grabb are now
healthy going into the NCAA Cham
pionships. Perhaps for the first time
all year, the Cardinal is going to be
playing with its top guns ready to go.
"We really missed Jim all year,"
teammate Eric Rosenfeld said. "He is
a key element to our team. We are
really glad to have him healthy for
nationals."
"We can't win without them,"
Gould said. "Four of our five losses
were when we were without Jim. I
think they are healthy, and we have a
good chance (at the NCAAs) because
of it."
Goldie and Grabb are essential to
Stanford's success as a team. In addi
tion to the fact that they play No. 1
and No. 2 in singles, they combine
forces to play No. 1 doubles for the
Cardinal. Because of injuries, their
record in limited duty is 5-2. Never
theless, they have improved the
team's doubles combinations.

"It's worked out well (the doubles
combinations)," Grabb said. "Our
team has improved. We have worked
on doubles hard. I think this year we
are as good as anyone in the
country."
Goldie and Grabb are ir
replaceable members of the Cardinal
team.
"I think it's pretty important in big
matches how the guys at the top of
the lineup play," teammate Patrick
McEnroe said. "I think it's great how
Dan did at Cal, winning both singles
and doubles. When you see your top
guy fighting harder than anyone else
and winning, I think it picks everyone
up a little."
Largely because of their aggressive
games, Goldie and Grabb have had
excellent Stanford careers and com
pare favorably with many of the past
Stanford greats.
Goldie has a career singles record
of 68-23 and has played No. 1 singles
for three seasons. Grabb's career
singles mark is 68-14, including two
years at No. 2 singles. Both enter the
NCAA singles competition as
favorites for the singles title.
Both Goldie and Grabb have had
experience with professional tennis.
Goldie has played two summers on

the Grand Prix circuit, while Grabb
has played a summer on the Grand
Prix and a summer on the satellite cir
cuit. Goldie has defeated such highly
regarded professionals as Jimmy
Arias, Brian Gottfried and Brian
Teacher and has already been ranked
in the top 100 in the world. Grabb
has also tasted some success, beating
Russell Simpson and John Lloyd.
"I think I should do all right,"
Goldie said of his future pro career.
"I have done well in the past. I think
finishing school is a big asset. I am
one of the few No. 1 players to finish
school in a long while."
"I'll stick with it for as long as I am
having fun," Grabb said. "I think
there is a chance to keep improving."
Gould is very optimistic about the
professional futures of his two
seniors. He sees Goldie and Grabb as
sure-fire top-50 players and probable
top-20 performers.
"Both are capable of being out
standing world class players," Gould
said. "They are in the same general
category as Scott Davis, Tim
Mayotte, Pat DuPre and John
Whitlinger. If they stay healthy and
continue to improve, I think they can
be top-20 world class players."

is the key to winning matches against
high-caliber players.
Stanford seniors Dan Goldie, who

employs an aggressive return of serve
and powerful groundstrokes, and Jim
Grabb, known for an outstanding
serve and volley combination, repre
sent both attacking modes of tennis.
Both have had remarkable results
from their styles of play, proving their
value to the Cardinal team and pro
viding nationwide individual recogni
tion. Both will turn professional after
this season.

"They are both aggressive-type
players," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said." Dan has one of the most devas
tating returns of serve that I have
ever seen. Jim has a great serve and
volley game."
Both Goldie and Grabb made an
immediate impact at Stanford as
freshmen.
Goldie entered Stanford as the No.
28 junior in the nation, while Grabb

came in as the No. 48 junior. Both
played behind Cardinal standouts
Scott Davis and John Letts in 1982.
Goldie played No. 3 singles while
Grabb performed at No. 6.
Goldie improved steadily as the
year went along, and Grabb lost only
one match all year. As freshmen, they
helped the Cardinal win the NCAA
team championships.
"Winning the title as a freshman —

that was a thrill," Goldie said.
"They were instrumental in win
ning it that year," Gould added.
In their sophomore seasons, Goldie
moved to the No. 1 position and
Grabb moved up the singles ladder as
well. They led the Cardinal to the
NCAA finals, and each received All-
America recognition.
Goldie reached the quarterfinals in
the NCAA singles championships.
During the summer, he competed on
the U.S. Junior Davis Cup Team. In
addition, he won a silver medal at the
1984 World University Games in Al
berta, Canada. He also won the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Championships.
As juniors in,'i9Bs, Grabb and
Goldie really maae their mark. Al
though the team was ousted in the
quarterfinals by Georgia, both Goldie
and Grabb had very successful indi
vidual seasons.
Goldie was ranked No. 1 nationally
for much of the year. His 19-5 singles
record included a convincing victory
over eventual NCAA singles cham
pion Michael Pernfors. He was the fa
vorite to win the NCAA singles title.
In the NCAA individual cham
pionships, however, Goldie was upset
in the quarterfinals. He ended the
season ranked No. 2 in the nation.
Grabb also enjoyed a fine season.
Playing No. 2 singles, he compiled an
18-3 record. He reached the semi
finals in the NCAA singles cham
pionships. Grabb finished the year
right behind Goldie, at No. 3 in the
nation.
Both players won individual titles
as juniors. Goldie was the Pacific-1()
Conference singles and doubles
champion (with Eric Rosenfeld).
Grabb won the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships.
With this already substantial suc
cess, even greater things were ex
pected of Goldie and Grabb as
seniors.
However, both have been beset
with injuries during the 1986 season.
Grabb has been able to compete in
only 10 matches to date, while Goldie
played a few matches hurt and was
bothered by an ankle injury in the
beginning of the year.
Despite their injuries, both have
had relatively successful seasons.
Goldie finished the dual match
season with an 11-7 record and was
ranked eighth nationally, down from
last year's No. 2 ranking. Grabb has
an 8-2 record.

After four years on the Farm and one NCAA team championship, Jim this Saturday. The Cardinal's No. 2 player has been bothered by a
Grabb will be looking for another in this year's NCAAs which begin groin injury but has still managed to compile an 8-2 record.
"I have played a couple matches
hurt, and maybe I haven't competed
as well," Goldie said of the difference
between last year and this season.
Both Goldie and Grabb are now
healthy going into the NCAA Cham
pionships. Perhaps for the first time
all year, the Cardinal is going to be
playing with its top guns ready to go.
"We really missed Jim all year,"
teammate Eric Rosenfeld said. "He is
a key element to our team. We are
really glad to have him healthy for
nationals."
"We can't win without them,"
Gould said. "Four of our five losses
were when we were without Jim. I
think they are healthy, and we have a
good chance (at the NCAAs) because
of it."
Goldie and Grabb are essential to
Stanford's success as a team. In addi
tion to the fact that they play No. 1
and No. 2 in singles, they combine
forces to play No. 1 doubles for the
Cardinal. Because of injuries, their
record in limited duty is 5-2. Never
theless, they have improved the
team's doubles combinations.

"It's worked out well (the doubles
combinations)," Grabb said. "Our
team has improved. We have worked
on doubles hard. I think this year we
are as good as anyone in the
country."
Goldie and Grabb are ir
replaceable members of the Cardinal
team.
"I think it's pretty important in big
matches how the guys at the top of
the lineup play," teammate Patrick
McEnroe said. "I think it's great how
Dan did at Cal, winning both singles
and doubles. When you see your top
guy fighting harder than anyone else
and winning, I think it picks everyone
up a little."
Largely because of their aggressive
games, Goldie and Grabb have had
excellent Stanford careers and com
pare favorably with many of the past
Stanford greats.
Goldie has a career singles record
of 68-23 and has played No. 1 singles
for three seasons. Grabb's career
singles mark is 68-14, including two
years at No. 2 singles. Both enter the
NCAA singles competition as
favorites for the singles title.
Both Goldie and Grabb have had
experience with professional tennis.
Goldie has played two summers on

the Grand Prix circuit, while Grabb
has played a summer on the Grand
Prix and a summer on the satellite cir
cuit. Goldie has defeated such highly
regarded professionals as Jimmy
Arias, Brian Gottfried and Brian
Teacher and has already been ranked
in the top 100 in the world. Grabb
has also tasted some success, beating
Russell Simpson and John Lloyd.
"I think I should do all right,"
Goldie said of his future pro career.
"I have done well in the past. I think
finishing school is a big asset. I am
one of the few No. 1 players to finish
school in a long while."
"I'll stick with it for as long as I am
having fun," Grabb said. "I think
there is a chance to keep improving."
Gould is very optimistic about the
professional futures of his two
seniors. He sees Goldie and Grabb as
sure-fire top-50 players and probable
top-20 performers.
"Both are capable of being out
standing world class players," Gould
said. "They are in the same general
category as Scott Davis, Tim
Mayotte, Pat DuPre and John
Whitlinger. If they stay healthy and
continue to improve, I think they can
be top-20 world class players."
