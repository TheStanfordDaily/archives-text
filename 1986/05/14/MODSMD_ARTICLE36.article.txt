## Goldie, Grabb key to netters' hopes 
### MATTHEW BODMAN Staff writer 
In order to win consistently in col
legiate or professional tennis today,
you must have an attacking style of
play. Aggressive tennis, whether from
the baseline or from serve and volley,
is the key to winning matches against
high-caliber players.
Stanford seniors Dan Goldie, who

employs an aggressive return of serve
and powerful groundstrokes, and Jim
Grabb, known for an outstanding
serve and volley combination, repre
sent both attacking modes of tennis.
Both have had remarkable results
from their styles of play, proving their
value to the Cardinal team and pro
viding nationwide individual recogni
tion. Both will turn professional after
this season.

"They are both aggressive-type
players," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said." Dan has one of the most devas
tating returns of serve that I have
ever seen. Jim has a great serve and
volley game."
Both Goldie and Grabb made an
immediate impact at Stanford as
freshmen.
Goldie entered Stanford as the No.
28 junior in the nation, while Grabb

came in as the No. 48 junior. Both
played behind Cardinal standouts
Scott Davis and John Letts in 1982.
Goldie played No. 3 singles while
Grabb performed at No. 6.
Goldie improved steadily as the
year went along, and Grabb lost only
one match all year. As freshmen, they
helped the Cardinal win the NCAA
team championships.
"Winning the title as a freshman â€”

that was a thrill," Goldie said.
"They were instrumental in win
ning it that year," Gould added.
In their sophomore seasons, Goldie
moved to the No. 1 position and
Grabb moved up the singles ladder as
well. They led the Cardinal to the
NCAA finals, and each received All-
America recognition.
Goldie reached the quarterfinals in
the NCAA singles championships.
During the summer, he competed on
the U.S. Junior Davis Cup Team. In
addition, he won a silver medal at the
1984 World University Games in Al
berta, Canada. He also won the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Championships.
As juniors in,'i9Bs, Grabb and
Goldie really maae their mark. Al
though the team was ousted in the
quarterfinals by Georgia, both Goldie
and Grabb had very successful indi
vidual seasons.
Goldie was ranked No. 1 nationally
for much of the year. His 19-5 singles
record included a convincing victory
over eventual NCAA singles cham
pion Michael Pernfors. He was the fa
vorite to win the NCAA singles title.
In the NCAA individual cham
pionships, however, Goldie was upset
in the quarterfinals. He ended the
season ranked No. 2 in the nation.
Grabb also enjoyed a fine season.
Playing No. 2 singles, he compiled an
18-3 record. He reached the semi
finals in the NCAA singles cham
pionships. Grabb finished the year
right behind Goldie, at No. 3 in the
nation.
Both players won individual titles
as juniors. Goldie was the Pacific-1()
Conference singles and doubles
champion (with Eric Rosenfeld).
Grabb won the Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships.
With this already substantial suc
cess, even greater things were ex
pected of Goldie and Grabb as
seniors.
However, both have been beset
with injuries during the 1986 season.
Grabb has been able to compete in
only 10 matches to date, while Goldie
played a few matches hurt and was
bothered by an ankle injury in the
beginning of the year.
Despite their injuries, both have
had relatively successful seasons.
Goldie finished the dual match
season with an 11-7 record and was
ranked eighth nationally, down from
last year's No. 2 ranking. Grabb has
an 8-2 record.
