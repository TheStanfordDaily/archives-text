# Stanford signs big men
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial staff 
Despite the loss of Coach
Tom Davis on April 6, the
Stanford men's basketball pro
gram did not lose any of the
recruits that Davis had landed,
as Sean Murphy and Deshon
Wingate, the final two players
the Cardinal was pursuing,
signed letters of intent on Mon
day.
Both Murphy, a 6-foot-9 for
ward from Cleveland, Miss.,
and Wingate, a 6-7 forward
from Austin, Texas, waited un
til the Stanford coaching situa
tion was sorted out before com
mitting to the Cardinal.
"We're really excited that
Sean and Deshon have decided
to stay with their initial deci
sion to attend Stanford even
with the coaching change," said
new Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery.
After being hired on April
25, Montgomery's first order of
business was to meet with
Murphy and Wingate. "It was
my first priority to visit them
and their families and make
sure they felt comfortable with
me and the program,"
Montgomery said. "Both felt
comfortable that the reasons
they had for coming to Stan
ford were still legitimate."
Murphy, an All-State per
fomer at Cleveland High
School, averaged 18 points, 15
rebounds and five blocked
shots per game as a senior. His
father, Ed Murphy, is the coach
at Delta State. "1 think Sean
Murphy is a four-man (power
forward) or a small forward. I
don't think he's a college cen
ter," Montgomery said."He'sa
real good shooter and a coach's
son so he knows the game
well."
In his senior year at Lanier
High School in Austin,
Wingate averaged 21 points
and 18 rebounds. He probably
will not get a chance to duplicate his
rebounding stats at Stanford, as
Montgomery plans to use him at
small forward.
"He played inside in high school,
but he'll have to learn to play facing
the basket," Montgomery said.
Montgomery is hoping that
Wingate will put some life into the
Cardinal's transition game. "He's an
athlete," Montgomery said. "He's an
active kid who can run and jump. We
need kids like that."
Murphy and Wingate bring solid
academic as well as athletic creden
tials to the Farm. Murphy, who finally
chose Stanford over Vanderbilt, had
a 3.9 grade point average in high
school, and Wingate, who turned

down scholarship offers from Rice,
William & Mary and Texas, was a
National Merit semifinalist.
"I chose Stanford because of its
academics and for the opportunities
that it presents upon graduation,"
Wingate said. "I considered Texas
and Rice also, but I feel that the state
of California offers a great change of
pace."
The acquisition of Murphy and
Wingate completes the Stanford
recruiting class for next season.
Joining them will be Stuart Thomas, a
6-9 forward from Fountain Valley,
and Oliver Cunningham, a 6-4 point
guard from Diamond Bar. Thomas
committed in November during the
early signing period, and Cunning
ham signed four weeks ago despite
not knowing who the new coach
would be.
