# Cardinal trio named to Six-Pac honor squad
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
Three Stanford players — Jack McDowell,
Toi Cook and John Ramos — were named to
the All Pacific-10 Conference Southern Divi
sion baseball team Monday.
Coaches from the six league schools voted
for the 19-member team.
UCLA Coach Gary Adams, who led the
Bruins to the Six-Pac title with a 21-9 confer
ence record, was chosen the Coach of the
Year by his counterparts. Tory Lovullo, the
Bruins' second baseman-shortstop, and Alex
Sanchez, UCLA's right-handed ace, shared
the Player of the Year award.
Sanchez, 16-2 on the year with a 4.06
ERA, struck out a league-leading 134 batters

in his 130-2/3 innings of work. Lovullo, who
homered twice against Stanford this year, hit
.323 with 16 home runs and 65 RBI in
UCLA's 60 games.
Others named to the All Six-Pac team
were: first basemen Todd Trafton of Arizona,
Ted Dyson of Arizona State and Bill Maas of
California; third baseman Jerry Goff of Cal;
shortstop Dan Henley of USC; and catcher
Todd Zeile of UCLA, who shares backstop
duties with Ramos.
Cook, Lance Blankenship of California
(honored for the fourth consecutive year),
Mike Senne of Arizona and Rick Morris of
Arizona State make up the team's outfield.
Both Steve Strong of Arizona and Scott
Sommers of USC made the team as desig
nated hitters. UCLA's John Joslyn was added

as a utility infielder.
McDowell, Brad Brink from USC and Gil
bert Heredia of Arizona — an 11-game win
ner— were named all-league pitchers.
All told, four players from conference
champion UCLA made the team. Arizona,
which plays Arizona State this weekend in
Tucson and is currently in third place in the
Six-Pac, also boasts four representatives.
Stanford, Cal and USC sent three players
each and ASU sent two.
McDowell, 10-4 on the year, led the Six-
Pac in ERA with his flashy 2.69 mark. The
right-hander, who won 11 of 15 decisions last
year for the Cardinal, allowed 113 hits in 127
innings, struck out 120 and walked only 38.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess called
McDowell's selection "almost a foregone
conclusion." Last year, McDowell, a sopho

more from Van Nuys, was an honorable men
tion selection. He was later chosen as the
country's Co-Freshman of the Year by
Baseball America.
Rightfielder Cook led Stanford in RBIs
with 45. The junior from Canoga Park also hit
a team-high .402 in Six-Pac play (.335 over
all). Moreover, he led the Cardinal in stolen
bases with 37 (in 42 attempts).
Ramos, who was named to the team last
year as an honorable mention, hit .347 overall
and .397 in league play. The junior from
Tampa, Fla., blasted six homers and knocked
in 41 runs while starting every one of Stan
ford's 56 games.
Stanford's coach seemed pleased with his
peers' decisions, even though the Cardinal
placed only three representatives on the the

squad. "Everyone on the team was deserv
ing," Marquess said. "It's a great all-league
team. ... I'm very happy with it."
Last year, six Cardinal players were named
to the Six-Pac's honor roll.
Marquess also said that Stanford's hopes of
hosting one of the two West Coast regionals
remain alive. "Our chances are still good," he
said. "We have a good national reputation
and have hosted successfully before. That
should help."
This year, the regionals will be held on the
weekend of Friday, May 23.
Stanford has hosted a regional twice in the
last three years. On both of those occasions,
the Cardinal advanced to the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb. Two years ago, when
Stanford played in Tempe, the team was
knocked out of the competition by ASU.

is known for his defense but still hit .397 in league play. Cook exploded after moving to the fourth spot in the
batting order and led the Cardinal in RBls with 45 and stolen bases with 37.
Three Stanford players — Jack McDowell,
Toi Cook and John Ramos — were named to
the All Pacific-10 Conference Southern Divi
sion baseball team Monday.
Coaches from the six league schools voted
for the 19-member team.
UCLA Coach Gary Adams, who led the
Bruins to the Six-Pac title with a 21-9 confer
ence record, was chosen the Coach of the
Year by his counterparts. Tory Lovullo, the
Bruins' second baseman-shortstop, and Alex
Sanchez, UCLA's right-handed ace, shared
the Player of the Year award.
Sanchez, 16-2 on the year with a 4.06
ERA, struck out a league-leading 134 batters

in his 130-2/3 innings of work. Lovullo, who
homered twice against Stanford this year, hit
.323 with 16 home runs and 65 RBI in
UCLA's 60 games.
Others named to the All Six-Pac team
were: first basemen Todd Trafton of Arizona,
Ted Dyson of Arizona State and Bill Maas of
California; third baseman Jerry Goff of Cal;
shortstop Dan Henley of USC; and catcher
Todd Zeile of UCLA, who shares backstop
duties with Ramos.
Cook, Lance Blankenship of California
(honored for the fourth consecutive year),
Mike Senne of Arizona and Rick Morris of
Arizona State make up the team's outfield.
Both Steve Strong of Arizona and Scott
Sommers of USC made the team as desig
nated hitters. UCLA's John Joslyn was added

as a utility infielder.
McDowell, Brad Brink from USC and Gil
bert Heredia of Arizona — an 11-game win
ner— were named all-league pitchers.
All told, four players from conference
champion UCLA made the team. Arizona,
which plays Arizona State this weekend in
Tucson and is currently in third place in the
Six-Pac, also boasts four representatives.
Stanford, Cal and USC sent three players
each and ASU sent two.
McDowell, 10-4 on the year, led the Six-
Pac in ERA with his flashy 2.69 mark. The
right-hander, who won 11 of 15 decisions last
year for the Cardinal, allowed 113 hits in 127
innings, struck out 120 and walked only 38.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess called
McDowell's selection "almost a foregone
conclusion." Last year, McDowell, a sopho

more from Van Nuys, was an honorable men
tion selection. He was later chosen as the
country's Co-Freshman of the Year by
Baseball America.
Rightfielder Cook led Stanford in RBIs
with 45. The junior from Canoga Park also hit
a team-high .402 in Six-Pac play (.335 over
all). Moreover, he led the Cardinal in stolen
bases with 37 (in 42 attempts).
Ramos, who was named to the team last
year as an honorable mention, hit .347 overall
and .397 in league play. The junior from
Tampa, Fla., blasted six homers and knocked
in 41 runs while starting every one of Stan
ford's 56 games.
Stanford's coach seemed pleased with his
peers' decisions, even though the Cardinal
placed only three representatives on the the

squad. "Everyone on the team was deserv
ing," Marquess said. "It's a great all-league
team. ... I'm very happy with it."
Last year, six Cardinal players were named
to the Six-Pac's honor roll.
Marquess also said that Stanford's hopes of
hosting one of the two West Coast regionals
remain alive. "Our chances are still good," he
said. "We have a good national reputation
and have hosted successfully before. That
should help."
This year, the regionals will be held on the
weekend of Friday, May 23.
Stanford has hosted a regional twice in the
last three years. On both of those occasions,
the Cardinal advanced to the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb. Two years ago, when
Stanford played in Tempe, the team was
knocked out of the competition by ASU.
