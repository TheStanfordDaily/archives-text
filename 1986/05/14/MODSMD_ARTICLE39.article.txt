Ultimate Frisbee
Knowing that a trip to the College Nation
als in St. Louis would be awarded to the top
three finishers, the Stanford men's ultimate
frisbee team traveled to Santa Barbara two
weekends ago for the Western Regional Col
legiate Championships.
The Cardinal was equal to the challenge of
both the wind, which at times gusted at 30
miles-pcr-hour, and the competition, as the
squad not only qualified, but captured first
place in the tournament with a 15-12 victory
over Oregon.
The victory was especially sweet because
Oregon had beaten Stanford to earn the top
seeding last year, ending the the Cardinal's
two-season winning streak at 33 games.
Coming into the crucial regional, there
were team members who must have believed
that Stanford's past successes in the col
legiate national tournament would not be
repeated this year. The previous weekend,
the Cardinal had fallen 17-11 to Chabot
Junior College in the Collegiate Sectional
finals.
"I began to have my doubts about this
team then," middle-deep Paul Chang said.
In Santa Barbara, however, Stanford
pulled itself together to defeat Humboldt
State in the quarterfinals, setting up an op
portunity for revenge against Chabot in the
semifinals.
The Chabot game was hampered by the
worst winds of the entire weekend, with both
teams unable to score upwind goals against
the zone defenses they were facing. Espe
cially prominent for Stanford in this game
was first-year player Peter Scheman, who
played a key role in Stanford's zone defense
and made some tough catches in the end
zone.
The two-and-a-half-hour contest finally
ended when Stanford quarterback Peter
Hecht hit Peter Lyon on a downwind bomb
to make the final score 10-9.
The final against Oregon was moved to a
more wind-protected field, enabling Stan
lord to run its regular offense with consider
able success. Although Stanford had beaten
Oregon 17-16 in an extremely hard-fought
game during Saturday's pool play, it was
anyone's guess as to which team would come
out on top in the final.
The brilliant defensive play of Spencer
Heywood was a critical factor in the relative

ease of Stanford's victory in the final.
"When we run our offense this well, and
when we have Spencer getting the diving
blocks on defense, we can beat any college
team in the country," Stanford's Kurt Fleis
cher said after the final game.
The Cardinal's offense" was explosive
against Oregon, with many scores coming on
long bombs from quarterbacks Hecht,
Heywood and Sandy Koonce to deeps Lyon,
Glenn Baker and Jim Nicholson.
Throughout the tournament, Stanford
benefitted from the return to action of
several key players who had been slowed by
injuries. Most notable were Baker, Koonce,
Wes Monroe, Scott Smallwood and Glenn
At wood.
The prospects for the Collegiate Nationals
on Memorial Day weekend in St. Louis are
good, according to Lyon. "If we play as well
as we did (in Santa Barbara) against Oregon,
then we will definitely be contenders along
with the strong Eastern schools like Cornell
and Vermont," he said.
Stanford will get its final tuneup before
nationals next weekend when the team
travels to Albuquerque, N.M., for an open
tournament against many of the best club
teams from the Southwest.
Cycling
Favorite Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
captured the regional cycling championships
on its own course last weekend as Stanford
had to settle for second place.
"We were the underdogs," Stanford's
Tom Moyer said. "They had beaten us pretty
regularly during the season. (But) we had a
chance. We were hoping to win."
The Mustangs jumped out to a 170-109
lead after Saturday's road race. The Cardinal
was paced by Moyer, who took third place in
the A race. Mike Fadich and Eric Saltzman
finished fifth and seventh, respectively.
Stanford's Bob Borchers was 10th Satur
day in the B race while Tom McMinn
captured fourth place in the C race. Laura
Rodman led the Cardinal women with a
sixth-place finish.
In Sunday's hilly criterium, Art Walker
and Moyer took fourth and sixth place,
respectively, in the A race. McMinn and
Hank Dart finished second and third in the B
race, and Rodman was third for the women.
