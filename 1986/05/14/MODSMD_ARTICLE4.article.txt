# Newmont shares to be sold
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
voted yesterday to divest of its $9,900
of shares in Newmont Mining, the
first divestment of South Africa
related stock by the University.
The board also decided:
• not to divest its holdings in Dia
mond Shamrock Petroleum, valued at
$400,000, at the present time. Stan
ford will divest in October unless the
company disposes of its interests in
South Africa by Oct. 1, as it has told
the University it will do.
• to charge its Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR) to
obtain further information on
Schlumberger's policies and perfor
mance in South Africa. Stanford
owns nearly $3.5 million of stock in
Schlumberger.
• to continue its year-old selective di
vestment policy, with a review early
in 1987.
The University will purchase no
further stock in Newmont or Dia
mond Shamrock under the current
circumstances.
At a noon press conference follow
ing yesterday's trustee meeting.
Board President Warren Christopher
said, "The board is absolutely united
in its abhorrence of apartheid. . . .
We believe the best result is likely to
be obtained at the present time by
continuing to hold stock and exerting

the maximum encouragement we can
to these companies, to make these
views known to South Africa and try
to achieve a change.
"Total divestment might give us a
moment of satisfaction, but the morn
ing after we would have lost all of our
leverage with South Africa. For the
time being, at least, we consider the
policy we're following the most pru
dent."
Stanford currently holds about
$ 182 million of stock in 80 companies
with business interests in South
Africa.
The Newmont Mining stock is un
usual among Stanford's South Africa
related holdings because it is part of a
trust from which the University
receives the income. The trustees will
ask the controller of that trust to
divest of the Newmont stock. The re
quest is expected to be fulfilled.
At a late afternoon meeting held
yesterday in Cubberley's conference
room, University President Donald
Kennedy told about 60 community
members that the trustees are
prepared to divest from
Schlumberger in the fall if the
French-based company does not im
prove its performance in South
Africa.
Schlumberger, the first non-U.S.
company to be reviewed by the Uni
versity, takes the stance that it is in-
appropriate for the company to take positions
on political issues, such as apartheid, relating
to a particular country.
The situation with Schlumberger offers the
opportunity to change company policy and
thereby increase the pressure on South Africa
to abolish apartheid, according to Kennedy.
Today's actions came in response to a re
commendation by the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (C-IR) to the SCIR that

Stanford divest from the three companies.
"The Newmont decision is exactly what we
asked for," C-IR Chairman Richard Brody,
professor of political science, told The Daily
yesterday."It is only the Schlumberger deci
sion which at all substantially modifies the C
IR recommendation, and we did discuss the
option adopted by the board."
Citing last February's Motorola decision as
a precedent, Brody said, "The decision in the
case of Diamond Shamrock is a sensible
amendation of our recommendation. It's a
decision to divest unless the company upholds
its promise to the University to sell its South

African interests."
In February 1985, the trustees voted not to
divest of its stock in Motorola unless it was
shown that the company had sold equipment
to the South African government or military
after 1983. Motorola subsequently an
nounced it was withdrawing from South
Africa, and Stanford still holds stock in the
company.
The University adopted a selective divest
ment policy several months later at a May
1985 trustee meeting.
"Generally speaking, [Newmont] did not
carry out a series of actions which we felt were

consistent with the Sullivan Principles, consis
tent with trying to bring an end to apartheid,"
Christopher said yesterday, explaining the
board's divestment decision.
The Sullivan Principles, devised by Rev.
Leon Sullivan of Philadelphia, are a code of
behavior relating to working conditions
against which U.S. companies in South Africa
are rated.
Newmont's subsidiary facilities were not
desegregated and have wages below the mini
mum living level, according to the Investor
Responsibility Center, a Washington, D.C.-
based group established by Stanford and

other non-profit organizations in the 19705.
The company also had failed to respond to
written inquiries from the C-IR about its
practices in South Africa.
"Put in baldest terms, Newmont profits
from apartheid and gives no evidence of being
active in attempting to change that system,"
Brody said in a report to the SCIR.
In related action, the trustees followed C
IR recommendations and voted to back
shareholder resolutions calling on Texaco,
Chevron, Mobil and Ford to end sales to
South African security forces. Stanford owns
nearly $20 million of stock in these firms.
