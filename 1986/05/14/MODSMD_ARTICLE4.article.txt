# Newmont shares to be sold
## 
### MARY YUH Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
voted yesterday to divest of its $9,900
of shares in Newmont Mining, the
first divestment of South Africa
related stock by the University.
The board also decided:
• not to divest its holdings in Dia
mond Shamrock Petroleum, valued at
$400,000, at the present time. Stan
ford will divest in October unless the
company disposes of its interests in
South Africa by Oct. 1, as it has told
the University it will do.
• to charge its Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility (SCIR) to
obtain further information on
Schlumberger's policies and perfor
mance in South Africa. Stanford
owns nearly $3.5 million of stock in
Schlumberger.
• to continue its year-old selective di
vestment policy, with a review early
in 1987.
The University will purchase no
further stock in Newmont or Dia
mond Shamrock under the current
circumstances.
At a noon press conference follow
ing yesterday's trustee meeting.
Board President Warren Christopher
said, "The board is absolutely united
in its abhorrence of apartheid. . . .
We believe the best result is likely to
be obtained at the present time by
continuing to hold stock and exerting

the maximum encouragement we can
to these companies, to make these
views known to South Africa and try
to achieve a change.
"Total divestment might give us a
moment of satisfaction, but the morn
ing after we would have lost all of our
leverage with South Africa. For the
time being, at least, we consider the
policy we're following the most pru
dent."
Stanford currently holds about
$ 182 million of stock in 80 companies
with business interests in South
Africa.
The Newmont Mining stock is un
usual among Stanford's South Africa
related holdings because it is part of a
trust from which the University
receives the income. The trustees will
ask the controller of that trust to
divest of the Newmont stock. The re
quest is expected to be fulfilled.
At a late afternoon meeting held
yesterday in Cubberley's conference
room, University President Donald
Kennedy told about 60 community
members that the trustees are
prepared to divest from
Schlumberger in the fall if the
French-based company does not im
prove its performance in South
Africa.
Schlumberger, the first non-U.S.
company to be reviewed by the Uni
versity, takes the stance that it is in-
