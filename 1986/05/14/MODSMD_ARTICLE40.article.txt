# Sailors disappointed in Irvine amidst coaching controversy
## 
### BRANDI WATSON Staff writer 
That the Stanford sailing team didn't do
well is a point of mutual agreement. Why
the team didn't do well seems to be the
problematic question.
Competing in the national qualifiers this
weekend against teams from all over Cali
fornia, the Cardinal sailing squad failed to
qualify in the dinghy events but pulled itself
together enough to qualify in the team
event.
"It was a good ending for a weekend that
was really frustrating," Stanford Coach Joe
Petrucci said. "It's nice to come back from
defeat to pull a victory."
This time, Stanford's strategy didn't pay
off as well as it had in the past. In approach
ing the very light air and flat conditions of
Irvine, sailors were used in various combina
tions.
"We used all combinations in all orders,
but we weren't a match for local schools in
local waters," Petrucci said. "The combina
tions were just flat."

Petrucci started with a lineup that in
cluded Rona Sisson paired with Suzy
Pritchett and Drew Gashler with Irma
Rodriguez. Petrucci next moved to skippers
Dan Buckstaff and Bill Shoemaker, but the
switch was not enough.
Shoemaker was eventually replaced by
Rich Bergsend, who continued to skipper to
the end. Trailing by 12 points after being
disqualified for hitting a marker, the team
never caught up and finished a disappointing
fourth behind USC, UC-Irvine and San
Diego State. "We were never in it," Petrucci
said.
The early defeat in the dinghy competi
tion was not only frustrating for the coach
but for the sailors as well, who questioned
Petrucci's tactics of putting relatively inex
perienced sailors in an important meet.
"The coach pulled a lot of unanticipated
stuff that threw the team off," team captain
Bergsend said. "I felt it may have had a det
rimental effect."
The long preparation for this event made
the team feel it could have performed better
than was reflected in the results. "I think we
could've done better," Bergsend said. "But

he sacrificed the effort. It was a real blow to
us."
In the team competition, Stanford came
back to take one race off reigning national
champion USC and qualify for the nationals
in the event. Drawing a bye in the first race,
the Cardinal had time to formulate strategy
against its competition.
"We figured out the other teams' strategy.
They were faster so we had to be more ag
gressive," Petrucci said. "We were ex
tremely aggressive."
The Cardinal boats managed to split the
series with USC with some daring sailing
moves. Two Stanford boats would entrap a
Trojan boat and then draw fouls on USC in
the ensuing collisions. Against teams with
better talent in those conditions, double
teaming and pulling fouls appeared to be the
right strategy. "We wanted to throw them
off balance," Petrucci said. "Desperate
people do desperate things."
The Cardinal went on to also split its se
ries with UC-Irvine. Stanford finished
second behind USC and qualified for the
team nationals June 6 at Tufts.
