Taiwan and China to negotiate
PEKING — Taiwan suddenly loosened its 37-year ban on any form of
contact with China's Communist regime yesterday by agreeing to let of
ficials of its national airline negotiate with their Peking counterparts
over the return of a plane and crew whose pilot defected to mainland
China.
if the negotiations take place as planned in Hong Kong, they would be
the first face-to-face talks since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949
between emissaries of the Nationalist government in Taipei and China's
Communist regime.
For the last several years, China has called for contacts between the
two sides as a prelude to reunification. But Taipei, which still claims to
be the legitimate government for the mainland, has repeatedly turned
down the offers.
Taiwan's President Chiang Ching-kuo once said that holding peace
talks with the Communists would be "tantamount to bargaining with a
tiger for its skin." Taiwan still prohibits any mail or telephone contact
with the mainland, and last year two Taiwan businessmen were arrested
and prosecuted in a military court for meeting with Chinese officials to
discuss trade opportunities.
Taipei's announcement of its willingness to sanction the face-to-face
contact was worded carefully to make it clear that no politics will be dis
cussed and that the meeting should not in any way be considered a first
step toward reunification talks.
"This is a single aviation incident, and the talks on the return of the
crew, aircraft and cargo will be a business-type discussion between two
civil aviation companies," said China Airlines, Taiwan's national flag
carrier, in a press release.
The sequence of developments that produced Taiwan's dramatic
reversal took place May 3, when a China Airlines Boeing 747 cargo
plane flying fruit and tires from Bangkok, Thailand, to Hong Kong sud
denly landed instead at Canton. The Taiwanese pilot, Wang Hsi-chuen,
57, explained that he wanted to defect to the mainland.
Canada to probe Deaver hiring
TORONTO — A Canadian parliamentary committee plans to con
duct a preliminary inquiry today on the circumstances surrounding
Canada's decision to pay former White House deputy chief of staff Mi
chael Deaver $105,000 for lobbying services.
"The basic issue is whether our government spent taxpayers' dough
knowingly violating U.S. law," Lloyd Axworthy, an opposition Liberal
Party member of parliament who has called for a wide-ranging investiga
tion, said in an interview.
The U.S. General Accounting Office told a congressional committee
Monday that Deaver "appears'-' to have violated conflict-of-interest laws
when he influenced the Reagan Administration to make an agreement
with Canada on acid rain while he was in the White House and later as a
lobbyist for Canada.
The 20-page report that the GAO prepared after a five-month inves
tigation of Deaver suggested he may have violated three separate laws in
his dealings on behalf of Canada. Those laws restrict former government
officials from representing anyone on matters in which they had been
personally and substantially involved while in office.
Italy expels 11th Libyan diplomat
ROME — The Italian government yesterday ordered the expulsion of
the 11th Libyan diplomat in two weeks, underlining the extent to which
Italy, long protective of its relations with Libya, has begun to crack down
on the North African nation.
The expulsion of Mustafa Mohammed Akresh, an employee of the
Libyan Consulate in the Sicilian capital of Palermo, came as the govern
ment ordered an investigation into the disclosures of a former Italian se
cret service chief about the extent of official Italian support for Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Khadafy a decade ago to prote.ct Italian economic
interests in Libya.
In announcing the expulsion order served on Akresh yesterday,
Foreign Ministry officials stated that the move was not a retaliation for
Khadafy's expulsion of 36 European officials, including 25 Italians,
Monday night. Foreign Ministry spokesmen indicated yesterday that
Akresh was being expelled solely because he had been involved in un
specified activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.
Two weeks ago, in accordance with decisions made at two meetings of
European Community foreign ministers at The Hague and Luxembourg
following last month's U.S. bombing of Libya, Italy ordered 10 Libyan
diplomats to leave the country. At that time, although it was left to the
Libyan People's Bureau, or embassy, in Rome to determine most of
those who should leave, another Libyan consul was singled out and or
dered to leave because of similiar activities.
Najibullah consolidating Afghans
NEW DELHI, India — Several high-profile appearances on state
controlled Afghanistan television indicate that the new Afghan leader,
Najibullah, is consolidating his position two weeks after being elevated
to the country's top post. Western diplomatic sources said here yester
day.
Najibullah, former head of the secret police who replaced the ailing
Babrak Karmal, was seen conferring with tribal leaders, military offi
cials, politburo members and diplomats in an effort at projecting a
smooth transition in the Kabul leadership, the diplomats said.
At several official functions, including a ceremony at the Soviet mili
tary headquarters shown on television, Najibullah's name was men
tioned first followed by Karmal and Premier Sultan Ali Keshtmand.
Diplomatic observers noted that Karmal, who has now been left with
the largely ceremonial post of president, appeared in poor physical
shape.
Aquino refuses aid from Marcos
MANILA, Philippines — President Corazon Aquino yesterday ex
pressed confidence that she could handle the Philippines' Communist in
surgency without "help" offered by deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos and said secret contacts on a proposed truce were under way.
Aquino said at a news conference that "definitely progress is being
made" in dealing with the Communist Party of the Philippines and its
armed wing, the New People's Army. But she said a formal cease-fire
has been held up by the refusal so far of top Communist leaders to .
negotiate with the government, which currently lacks the resources to
offer a rehabilitation program for surrendering rebels.
Aquino made the statements amid signs of increasing military restive
ness over an escalation of Communist rebel attacks since her govern
ment came to power Feb. 25 in a military-led popular revolt. According
to the military, about 750 troops, rebels and civilians have been killed in
insurgency-related incidents since then. The intensified fighting has
dimmed hopes that the flight of Marcos into exile would prompt many of
the estimated 16,000 Communist guerrillas to lay down their arms.
Asked about Marcos' offer Monday to return to the Philippines and
help the Aquino government avert a Communist takeover or a military
coup, Aquino said, "For the time being. I'd much rather Mr. Marcos
stayed away. I think I can handle the insurgency problem, and it will be
better if he is not here because that will only make matters worse as far
as the Filipinos are concerned."
Marcos made the offer by telephone in a news conference with cor
respondents in Manila. Speaking from his exile home in Hawaii, Marcos
asserted that"l can help in preventing a civil war." He said his only pur
pose in returning to Manila would be "to ensure that the Philippines
does not come under a totalitarian regime." However, he said he would
not renounce his "legitimate election" as president Feb. 7 in a contest he
was accused of rigging to defeat Aquino.

Diplomatic observers noted that Karmal, who has now been left with
the largely ceremonial post of president, appeared in poor physical
shape.
Aquino refuses aid from Marcos
MANILA, Philippines — President Corazon Aquino yesterday ex
pressed confidence that she could handle the Philippines' Communist in
surgency without "help" offered by deposed President Ferdinand
Marcos and said secret contacts on a proposed truce were under way.
Aquino said at a news conference that "definitely progress is being
made" in dealing with the Communist Party of the Philippines and its
armed wing, the New People's Army. But she said a formal cease-fire
has been held up by the refusal so far of top Communist leaders to .
negotiate with the government, which currently lacks the resources to
offer a rehabilitation program for surrendering rebels.
Aquino made the statements amid signs of increasing military restive
ness over an escalation of Communist rebel attacks since her govern
ment came to power Feb. 25 in a military-led popular revolt. According
to the military, about 750 troops, rebels and civilians have been killed in
insurgency-related incidents since then. The intensified fighting has
dimmed hopes that the flight of Marcos into exile would prompt many of
the estimated 16,000 Communist guerrillas to lay down their arms.
Asked about Marcos' offer Monday to return to the Philippines and
help the Aquino government avert a Communist takeover or a military
coup, Aquino said, "For the time being. I'd much rather Mr. Marcos
stayed away. I think I can handle the insurgency problem, and it will be
better if he is not here because that will only make matters worse as far
as the Filipinos are concerned."
Marcos made the offer by telephone in a news conference with cor
respondents in Manila. Speaking from his exile home in Hawaii, Marcos
asserted that"l can help in preventing a civil war." He said his only pur
pose in returning to Manila would be "to ensure that the Philippines
does not come under a totalitarian regime." However, he said he would
not renounce his "legitimate election" as president Feb. 7 in a contest he
was accused of rigging to defeat Aquino.
Taiwan and China to negotiate
PEKING — Taiwan suddenly loosened its 37-year ban on any form of
contact with China's Communist regime yesterday by agreeing to let of
ficials of its national airline negotiate with their Peking counterparts
over the return of a plane and crew whose pilot defected to mainland
China.
if the negotiations take place as planned in Hong Kong, they would be
the first face-to-face talks since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949
between emissaries of the Nationalist government in Taipei and China's
Communist regime.
For the last several years, China has called for contacts between the
two sides as a prelude to reunification. But Taipei, which still claims to
be the legitimate government for the mainland, has repeatedly turned
down the offers.
Taiwan's President Chiang Ching-kuo once said that holding peace
talks with the Communists would be "tantamount to bargaining with a
tiger for its skin." Taiwan still prohibits any mail or telephone contact
with the mainland, and last year two Taiwan businessmen were arrested
and prosecuted in a military court for meeting with Chinese officials to
discuss trade opportunities.
Taipei's announcement of its willingness to sanction the face-to-face
contact was worded carefully to make it clear that no politics will be dis
cussed and that the meeting should not in any way be considered a first
step toward reunification talks.
"This is a single aviation incident, and the talks on the return of the
crew, aircraft and cargo will be a business-type discussion between two
civil aviation companies," said China Airlines, Taiwan's national flag
carrier, in a press release.
The sequence of developments that produced Taiwan's dramatic
reversal took place May 3, when a China Airlines Boeing 747 cargo
plane flying fruit and tires from Bangkok, Thailand, to Hong Kong sud
denly landed instead at Canton. The Taiwanese pilot, Wang Hsi-chuen,
57, explained that he wanted to defect to the mainland.
Canada to probe Deaver hiring
TORONTO — A Canadian parliamentary committee plans to con
duct a preliminary inquiry today on the circumstances surrounding
Canada's decision to pay former White House deputy chief of staff Mi
chael Deaver $105,000 for lobbying services.
"The basic issue is whether our government spent taxpayers' dough
knowingly violating U.S. law," Lloyd Axworthy, an opposition Liberal
Party member of parliament who has called for a wide-ranging investiga
tion, said in an interview.
The U.S. General Accounting Office told a congressional committee
Monday that Deaver "appears'-' to have violated conflict-of-interest laws
when he influenced the Reagan Administration to make an agreement
with Canada on acid rain while he was in the White House and later as a
lobbyist for Canada.
The 20-page report that the GAO prepared after a five-month inves
tigation of Deaver suggested he may have violated three separate laws in
his dealings on behalf of Canada. Those laws restrict former government
officials from representing anyone on matters in which they had been
personally and substantially involved while in office.
Italy expels 11th Libyan diplomat
ROME — The Italian government yesterday ordered the expulsion of
the 11th Libyan diplomat in two weeks, underlining the extent to which
Italy, long protective of its relations with Libya, has begun to crack down
on the North African nation.
The expulsion of Mustafa Mohammed Akresh, an employee of the
Libyan Consulate in the Sicilian capital of Palermo, came as the govern
ment ordered an investigation into the disclosures of a former Italian se
cret service chief about the extent of official Italian support for Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Khadafy a decade ago to prote.ct Italian economic
interests in Libya.
In announcing the expulsion order served on Akresh yesterday,
Foreign Ministry officials stated that the move was not a retaliation for
Khadafy's expulsion of 36 European officials, including 25 Italians,
Monday night. Foreign Ministry spokesmen indicated yesterday that
Akresh was being expelled solely because he had been involved in un
specified activities incompatible with his diplomatic status.
Two weeks ago, in accordance with decisions made at two meetings of
European Community foreign ministers at The Hague and Luxembourg
following last month's U.S. bombing of Libya, Italy ordered 10 Libyan
diplomats to leave the country. At that time, although it was left to the
Libyan People's Bureau, or embassy, in Rome to determine most of
those who should leave, another Libyan consul was singled out and or
dered to leave because of similiar activities.
Najibullah consolidating Afghans
NEW DELHI, India — Several high-profile appearances on state
controlled Afghanistan television indicate that the new Afghan leader,
Najibullah, is consolidating his position two weeks after being elevated
to the country's top post. Western diplomatic sources said here yester
day.
Najibullah, former head of the secret police who replaced the ailing
Babrak Karmal, was seen conferring with tribal leaders, military offi
cials, politburo members and diplomats in an effort at projecting a
smooth transition in the Kabul leadership, the diplomats said.
At several official functions, including a ceremony at the Soviet mili
tary headquarters shown on television, Najibullah's name was men
tioned first followed by Karmal and Premier Sultan Ali Keshtmand.
Diplomatic observers noted that Karmal, who has now been left with
