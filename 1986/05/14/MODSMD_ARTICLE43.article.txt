MOSCOW — The Soviet media
yesterday described "colossal work"
going on at the devastated nuclear re
actor in the Ukraine to contain its
deadly radiation and decontaminate
the area.
The reports were published as one
of the designers of the reactor said
that the facility must be sheathed for
centuries in the concrete tomb now
being built for it in order to neutralize
its deadly radiation leaks completely.
Pravda and other Soviet papers re
ported that a nuclear catastrophe was
averted a week ago when an under
water reservoir was drained with the
help of volunteer divers who exposed
themselves to heavy doses of radia
tion.
Pravda quoted Yevgeny Velikhov,
a physicist and vice president of the
Academy of Sciences, as describing
how a major threat of reactor
meltdown was averted during the
emergency procedures that followed
the initial explosion and fire, which
occurred early April 26.
Velikhov said that the damaged re
actor, pressed down from above by
thousands of tons of sand, lead and
other fire-extinguishing materials,

was in danger of plunging into an un
derwater reservoir, which would have
released radioactive steam into the
atmosphere.
Velikhov said that water was
pumped from the reservoir, a cooling
zone was set up to absorb the reac
tor's heat and the process of encasing
it in concrete was begun.
Ivan Yemilianov, deputy director
of the organization that designed the
No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl, told West
European reporters that it will be
centuries before the reactor is consid
ered free of radiation hazard. The
other three reactors at Chernobyl will
be started up again as soon as the
area is decontaminated and work is
completed on the thick concrete tomb
that will sheathe the damaged reac
tor, he said.
After 17 days of silence on the dis
aster, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev scheduled a speech today with
out indicating his topic.
Diplomats speculated that the
Kremlin chief would discuss Cher
nobyl for the first time since the acci
dent raised radiation levels in most of
Europe and triggered condemnations
of Soviet secretiveness.
