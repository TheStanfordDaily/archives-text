# Presser object of second jury probe

WASHINGTON — Teamsters
President Jackie Presser, already the
target of a Cleveland grand jury's
renewed labor fraud investigation,
also is under scrutiny by a federal
grand jury in New York in connection
with alleged Mafia efforts to control
his 1.7 million-member union, the
Los Angeles Times learned yester
day.
Those efforts, government sources
said, date back to 1983 when Presser
associates allegedly gained the sup
port of Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno,
reputed boss of the Genovese organ
ized crime family in New York, for
Presser's election as Teamsters presi
dent.
One official said that Trott wanted
to delay the New York case until

completion of the Cleveland probe —
which is focusing on Presser's alleged
payment of hundreds of thousands of.
dollars of union funds to "ghost
employees" who did no work — and
a related inquiry here into allegedly
false statements by one or more FBI
agents who oversaw Presser's service
as an FBI informant.
If charges are filed against Presser
in the New York investigation,
sources said, they would be added to
those brought March 21 in an indict
ment against Salerno and 14 other
defendants — nine of them alleged
high-ranking members of the
Genovese family. Those charges in
clude widespread construction bid
rigging, extortion, gambling and mur
der conspiracies and extensive labor
racketeering.
