Radiation found in food
The Food and Drug Administration has de
tected the first above-normal traces of radiation
in food entering the United States since the So
viet Union's Chernobyl nuclear plant accident.
But officials said the levels were far too low to
present a health hazard.
The FDA, which began its monitoring program
of imported foods May 5, has f ound above nor
mal traces of seven samples of Norwegian salmon
and two samples of Italian mushrooms. David
Duarte, a spokesman for the FDA, said on the
basis of ground-level radiation monitoring
abroad, the agency expects no serious radiation
contamination in imported foods. American food
concerns also have said they expect no contami
nation problems.
The types of products consumers are most
familiar with that will be part of the inspections
are sausages, hams, leafy vegetables and fish such
as salmon.
Test site radiation high
WASHINGTON — More than a month after a
mishap during an underground nuclear test at the
Nevada Test Site, radiation in a tunnel containing
test equipment is still so high that the tunnel can

not be re-entered for "several weeks," according
to a Department of Energy spokesman.
Monitors in the tunnel are registering "about
25 rads per hour," the spokesman said. Under
current standards involving measurements of ra
diation exposure, 450 rads would kill half of
those exposed to them, while five rads is consid
ered a safe level over a year.
The radiation is being contained in the tunnel
because of a cement door 8 to 10 feet thick. But
DOE officials reported yesterday that the bodies
of two of about 60 employees working in protec
tive clothing to clear the area outside the test tun
nel have shown higher than normal radiation
levels.
One worker was found last Friday to have ab
sorbed 200 millirems of radioactive iodine-131 in
the thyroid. Occupational safety guidelines per
mit 5,000 millirems in any three-month period.
This was the third time in 10 years that such an
accident has occurred, a Defense Nuclear
Agency official said yesterday.
Millions may be paid
WASHINGTON — The Senate Finance Com
mittee's radical tax-overhaul bill contains a hid
den provision obligating the U.S. Treasury to
write hundreds of millions of dollars of checks to

ailing steel companies over the next several
years.
The provision, which has not yet been made
public, is one of several dozen "transition rules"
aimed at easing the adjustment of companies and
people to a new tax system. It would save for
most steel firms a portion of the investment tax
credit, a subsidy for equipment purchases that is
being repealed.
Taken together, such exceptions to the com
mittee's bill would be worth $5.5 billion to their
beneficiaries by 1991. They were as hard-fought
as major provisions in the legislation that passed
the committee last week.
The rationale, according to industry officials, is
that the investment credit creates tax writeoffs
only for those who pay taxes. Because the steel
industry has suffered sustained losses, most steel
makers have accumulated tax credits, but have
no tax liability against which to use them. With
out a special rule, most of the credits would
expire unused, industry officials said.
Prices close lower
NEW YORK — The Dow Jones average
wavered near Monday's closing level during an
indecisive session and finally finished with a
modest loss of 1.99 at 1,785.34.
