Navy official testifies
SAN FRANCISCO — A Navy official yester
day described the classified information Jerry
Whitworth is accused of passing to masterspy
John Walker for delivery to the Soviet Union as
"the most critical information."
"Basically, what you have here is the cook
book of how to do business," said Lt. Cmdr.
James Jeter, an exercise officer with the Pacific
Fleet in Hawaii, referring to the Navy code and
communcations system allegedly passed by Whit
worth.
Whitworth, 46, a former Navy radioman from
Davis, Calif., is accused of selling secrets for
$332,000 to Walker for relay to the Soviets be
tween 1974 and 1983.
Walker, a former Navy radioman who has ad
mitted running a spy ring for 17 years, was the
chief prosecution witness against Whitworth, his
alleged prize recruit into espionage.
Previous testimony has shown that federal offi
cials found a note from Whitworth to Walker that
said he had obtained all message traffic from the
USS Enterprise, on which he was stationed.

during fleet exercises between 1982 and 1983.
The specific message traffic Jeter discussed
during testimony was from an exercise that took
place in April 1983 off the coast of the Soviet
Union.
Reading from a classified "quick look" or eval
uation of the exercise, Jeter said, "The most sur
prising, disappointing aspect of this exercise was
a lower than expected Soviet reaction."
Jones said message traffic from the 1983 exer
cise would provide "very good insight as to how
the U.S. Navy would conduct anti-air warfare" to
anyone who read the documents.
SD County may sue feds
SAN DIEGO — A San Diego County super
visor yesterday took the first step toward con
vincing her colleagues to sue the federal govern
ment for the money spent on prosecuting and
caring for illegal aliens.
Susan Golding placed her proposed suit on the
docket for discussion next week. The proposal
calls for a suit to be prepared by the county coun-

sel and for the county's chief administrative offi
cer to check with other similarly affected counties
around the nation to see Whether they want to
join the action.
Golding said Monday the lawsuit will seek to
collect $23.2 million, the amount she estimates
the county has spent since 1984 to detain and
prosecute undocumented aliens involved in
crimes and to provide them with health care and
social services. She said the figure could be as
high as $80 million.
The county unsuccessfully tried in 1978 to
force the federal government to pay health care
costs for undocumented aliens. Golding said she
isn t sure that a new lawsuit would succeed where
the earlier one failed.
