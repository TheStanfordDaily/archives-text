# Provost condemns Davies' legal action
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
University Provost James Rosse yesterday
attributed the History Department's decision
to deny visiting Prof. Norman Davies tenure
to criticism that Davies' scholarship suffers
from "partisanship," and condemned
Davies' lawsuit against department members
as "an egregious piece of behavior."
But Davies last night described the depart
ment's decision as "covert," reaffirming his
view that department members voted in Jan
uary to deny him a position because of his
political views.
Rosse, in an earlier statement, had des
cribed Davies' charge as "completely false."
Davies, an expert on Polish history and
director of Stanford's new overseas program
in Krakow, filed his $3 million suit earlier
this month against Prof. Harold Kahn and 30
unnamed members of the department, who
he alleges denied him a vacant endowed po
sition in Eastern European studies because
of his treatment of Polish-Jewish relations in
a chapter of a book on Polish history.
Kahn declined to comment last night.

saying only that any statements should come
from the department chairman.
Former Republican Congressman Pete
McCloskey, who will represent Davies, af
firmed last week that Davies believes depart
ment members denied him the post because
of his political views. He was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
The chapter in question is from "God's
Playground: A History of Poland," a highly
regarded book Davies published in 1981.
In a May 12 statement, Davies asserted
that a May 2 letter from Rosse explaining the
department's decision "confirms my in
formed belief that the History Department
faculty denied me the appointment . . . not
because they possessed some new or sub
stantiated evidence of defective scholarship
or teaching, but because they disliked my
viewpoint on controversial issues, and in par
ticular on the history of Polish-Jewish rela
tions."
Davies, in his statement, quotes this sen
tence from Rosse's letter of explanation:
"The complaint focused on the chapter of
'God's Playground' on the Jews,
which the critics found not merely in
sensitive but unacceptably defensive
of the behavior of the Poles."
The statement continued,
"Unfortunately, Stanford's Legal
Counsel ruled that, as a visiting pro
fessor, I do not qualify for Stanford's
internal processes of grievance and
appeal. As a result, I am not
protected by Stanford's Statement of
Academic Freedom, and have not
been permitted at any stage to state
my case.... I have not been granted
any sort of hearing at all. Yet Stan
ford's Legal Counsel has stated in ad
vance that the case is 'without
merit.'. . . Legal action was taken
only as a last, reluctant resort."
Rosse yesterday issued a response
to Davies' allegations, charging him
with misrepresenting the original let
ter of explanation.
"(Davies) quoted only one sen
tence from the letter — and inac
curately, at that," Rosse said.
"Davies leaves the reader with the
impression that there was only one
criticism of his scholarship and that it
concerned only the chapter of his
book that dealt with Polish-Jewish re
lations ... the criticism was not lim

ited to the Jewish question, but that
the chapter on the Jews was consid
ered emblematic of a general concern
about lack of objectivity."
With regard to Davies' charges that
he has been denied a fair hearing,
Rosse responded he had "indicated
to (Davies) at that time that if, after
receiving my letter (explaining the
department's decision), he had addi
tional evidence to present that sug
gested improper considerations had a
bearing on the decision, I would con
sider conducting a further investiga
tion."
Davies last night said that "the only
competent historians in the field (of
Polish history) were in the search
committee, which unanimously ap
proved me (for the post)."
"I don't think (the other depart
ment faculty) understand their his
tory," Davies said.
In any event, Davies said, political
views should not play any part in de
ciding the academic merit of an indi
vidual.
Davies said that if an out-of-court
resolution is not reached, department
members will eventually be issued
subpoenas forcing them to reveal the
views expressed at the January
meeting.
"The first purpose of the lawsuit is
to discover what happened on Jan.
15, and who said what," Davies said.

stantiated evidence of defective scholarship
or teaching, but because they disliked my
viewpoint on controversial issues, and in par
ticular on the history of Polish-Jewish rela
tions."
Davies, in his statement, quotes this sen
tence from Rosse's letter of explanation:
"The complaint focused on the chapter of
'God's Playground' on the Jews,
which the critics found not merely in
sensitive but unacceptably defensive
of the behavior of the Poles."
The statement continued,
"Unfortunately, Stanford's Legal
Counsel ruled that, as a visiting pro
fessor, I do not qualify for Stanford's
internal processes of grievance and
appeal. As a result, I am not
protected by Stanford's Statement of
Academic Freedom, and have not
been permitted at any stage to state
my case.... I have not been granted
any sort of hearing at all. Yet Stan
ford's Legal Counsel has stated in ad
vance that the case is 'without
merit.'. . . Legal action was taken
only as a last, reluctant resort."
Rosse yesterday issued a response
to Davies' allegations, charging him
with misrepresenting the original let
ter of explanation.
"(Davies) quoted only one sen
tence from the letter — and inac
curately, at that," Rosse said.
"Davies leaves the reader with the
impression that there was only one
criticism of his scholarship and that it
concerned only the chapter of his
book that dealt with Polish-Jewish re
lations ... the criticism was not lim

ited to the Jewish question, but that
the chapter on the Jews was consid
ered emblematic of a general concern
about lack of objectivity."
With regard to Davies' charges that
he has been denied a fair hearing,
Rosse responded he had "indicated
to (Davies) at that time that if, after
receiving my letter (explaining the
department's decision), he had addi
tional evidence to present that sug
gested improper considerations had a
bearing on the decision, I would con
sider conducting a further investiga
tion."
Davies last night said that "the only
competent historians in the field (of
Polish history) were in the search
committee, which unanimously ap
proved me (for the post)."
"I don't think (the other depart
ment faculty) understand their his
tory," Davies said.
In any event, Davies said, political
views should not play any part in de
ciding the academic merit of an indi
vidual.
Davies said that if an out-of-court
resolution is not reached, department
members will eventually be issued
subpoenas forcing them to reveal the
views expressed at the January
meeting.
"The first purpose of the lawsuit is
to discover what happened on Jan.
15, and who said what," Davies said.
