# Provost condemns Davies' legal action
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
University Provost James Rosse yesterday
attributed the History Department's decision
to deny visiting Prof. Norman Davies tenure
to criticism that Davies' scholarship suffers

Davies, in his statement, quotes this sen
