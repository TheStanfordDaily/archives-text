# University issues Alpha Delt ultimatum
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Staff writer 
In a letter to Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson, University officials have recom
mended suspending Alpha Delta Phi's housing
privileges unless the fraternity meets nine
University-outlined conditions.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin
and Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said in
the letter that due to sustained problems over the
past several years, "The University has come to
doubt whether the environment of the Alpha Delta
House constitutes a safe, healthy and educationally
sound place for Stanford students to live."
In particular, the letter cited "persistent reports
of drug use, abuse and sales; academic problems;
indebtedness; and failure to house Alpha Delts'
fair share of guaranteed male students in accor
dance with the fraternity quota system."
However, the letter went on to say that since the
Alpha Delts and their alumni have taken meaning
ful steps toward addressing these problems, the
suspension will be stayed if house members meet
nine conditions outlined by the University.
The conditions were outlined by the University
during meetings with Alpha Delt members and are

considered by both parties to be a positive ap
proach, according to sources who attended the
meetings. They will be in effect for a two-year per
iod and pertain to almost all aspects of fraternity
life.
The first two conditions, which Conklin and
Pisano said "strike at the core of the problems Al
pha Delta Phi has had for many years now," ask
each resident of the fraternity to sign a statement to
the effect that he will abstain from drug use as a
condition of house membership.
In an interview yesterday, Pisano said, "I have
every reason to believe that they will fulfill all the
conditions, but if at any time they don't then our
recommendation is that they be removed from
campus housing immediately."
While the University remains "cautiously opti
mistic" about the Alpha Delt situation, members of
the fraternity say they are enthusiastic and commit
ted to changing the house and its reputation.
Alpha Delt Rush Chairman Greg Smith said,
"The whole house has been working hard against
our drug image. Now, we are an anti-cocaine
house. As far as I know, we are the only fraternity
with no cocaine use, and (cocaine) is a very com

mon drug in Stanford mainstream that is not a
problem here."
Smith added that the Alpha Delts were working
toward attracting more students to their fraternity.
"Our Rush catered to a more mainstream Stanford
population and we did get a much more varied
Rush class," he said. "1 have seen a considerable
change in this house. The real problems have been
dealt with and now we just need time for the good
things to show."
Conklin said that currently, "if you like to use
drugs, you'll be comfortable there (at the Alpha
Delts)." She said she hoped the University action
will change this perception.
In addition, the fraternity must:
• create a faculty/student/administration/alumni
consulting board;
• submit to Interfraternity Council monitoring of
progress for the duration of this agreement;
• meet the 1986 quota for house members;
• pay the house debt in full by June 15;
• present to the University quarterly progress
reports; and
• devise a system of financial and house manage
ment that will prevent recurrence of problems.
