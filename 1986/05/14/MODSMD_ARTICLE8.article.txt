# Knight fellows will audit classes
## 
### VIVIAN ROGERS 
A dozen professional journalists from
newspapers across the country have been
awarded the latest round of John S. Knight fel
lowships, which will allow them to audit classes at
Stanford next year.
"The goal of the program is to choose out
standing journalists and help them become the
best in their field," said James Risser, director of
the Knight fellowship program. "We hope to im
prove the level of American journalism in the
future."
After a year at Stanford, many fellows have
gone on to earn high marks in the communication
industry. Five Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded
to former fellows; Risser, a 1973-74 fellow, won
two of them while working for the Des Moines
Register. Another former fellow, Kurt Luedtke,
recently won an Oscar for the screenplay to the
film, "Out Of Africa."
While the fellows are here, they are encour
aged not to write professionally and to get a new
"perspective on their profession, daily work and
themselves," said Harry Press, managing director
of the program. The fellows do this by taking
classes in any department except Communica
tions.
The only required part of the program is atten
dance at weekly seminars. The fellows meet dis
tinguished scholars from Stanford and elsewhere

and leaders in the public and private sectors.
The program's acceptance process is very com
petitive, Press said, adding that 80 to 90 jour
nalists apply each year.
In the application, the journalists are asked to
explain how a fellowship will further their careers
or improve their outlook on the world.
"We want people who will take classes rele
vant to what they do or want to do in the future,"
Risser said.
The next academic year will be the 21st year of
the professional journalism fellowships. The fel
lowship includes a nine-month stipend of
$20,000 and a book allowance to help partici
pants pay for their year here.
Next year's fellows are:
• Gary Delsohn, an urban affairs writer from The
Denver Post. His primary focus will be on the
governance of U.S. cities and public/private
partnerships.
• Michael Greenberg, a senior critic from the San
Antonio Express-News. He will study the impact
of Latin American history and culture on the
American Southwest.
• Mark Jaffe, an environmental writer from The

• Michael Kernan, a reporter from The Washing

drama and creative writing.
