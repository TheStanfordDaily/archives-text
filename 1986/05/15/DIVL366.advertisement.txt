My life with John Lis (Part 3)
It happened after one of his
nights of hard drinking. At 5 a.m.,
he stumbled into the room, reeking
of Tanqueray and cologne. I sat up
in bed when I heard him crash into
his trophy case and faceplant into
his dirty laundry.
I turned on the bedside lamp.
"Johnny?" I whispered. "Baby?"
I got out of bed and knelt beside
his crumpled body. "You've been
out drinking with Chuck Hil
debrand again, haven't you?"
