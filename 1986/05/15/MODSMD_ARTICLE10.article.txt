### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
One of the first tasks of the San
dinista Revolution was to declare
health care "a right of the people,"
Mary Ellsberg-Martinez said here
last night.
Ellsberg, daughter of prominent
Vietnam War critic Daniel Ells
berg, is director of public health
education in the South Atlantic
region of Nicaragua.
Speaking to an audience of about
40 in Fairchild Auditorium last
night, Ellsberg said that although
the Sandinista Revolution has
made significant strides in health
care, progress is being undermined
by the contra war.
"Around the time of the revolu
tion, health conditions were
deplorable," Ellsberg said. "Major
problems were malaria, worms,
measles and diarrhea."
Since that time, it has been a
"real concern on the part of the
people to eliminate" such diseases,
she said.
Ellsberg went on to explain that
in addition to building 17 new
hospitals since the revolution, the

Sandinista government also trains
members of villages in primary
care.
These trained volunteers, known
as "Brigadistas," are elected by
their fellow villagers and trained in
first aid techniques during special
workshops.
As an example of the Brigadistas'
effectiveness, Ellsberg cited the
case of a woman from a remote vil
lage who had suffered severe ma
chete wounds during a contra attack.
The local Brigadista stopped the
bleeding and "carried her on his
back for two days to a health cen
ter," Ellsberg said.
The contras, however, have ham
pered health-care efforts, she said.
Frequent killings of health care
workers have inhibited doctors
from traveling to remote areas
which desperately need medical
aid.
Referring to the Brigadistas, El
lsberg said that "many of them
were kidnapped, and we've never
heard from them again."
Ellsberg cited the case of a cer
tain Brigadista who ignored contra
demands that he abandon a local
vaccination program. The Contras

then "pulled him out in front of his
family and slit his throat," Ellsberg
said.
In sum, Ellsberg said that the
contras have kidnapped or killed
more than 60 health workers and
have destroyed 61 health units.
In addition to training the
Brigadistas, the Sandinista govern
ment is also supporting the training
and coordination of traditional
midwives, who deliver about 60
percent of the babies in Nicaragua.
The purpose of midwife training
is to utilize this important resource,
and teach them some new skills,
Ellsberg said.
At a higher level, the number of
doctors in Nicaragua "is going to be
increased by 500 per year," be
cause of the new medical school
opened in Managua the year after
the revolution, Ellsberg said.
These programs have achieved
impressive results, according to
various international agencies.
UNICEF cited Nicaragua's prog
ress in this area as "the most spec
tacular achievement by any Third
World country in (child) health
care."
