## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Davies deserves appeal 
### 
Once again, the University has made a decison in a
veil of secrecy behind closed doors. And once again, it
appears students will wind up the losers in yet another
battle over tenure.
Visiting History Prof. Norman Davies came to Stan
ford touted as one of the world's leading scholars on
East European history. He was unanimously approved
for a tenured position by a faculty committee, and he
has received rave reviews from students. Why, then,
did the History Department vote to deny him tenure,
and why does the University now refuse to give Davies
and the Stanford community a clear justification? The
University's silence on the matter only lends legitimacy
to Davies' claim that he was denied because of his poli
tical beliefs regarding Polish-Jewish relations. It is a
shame Davies was left with no choice but to file suit.
Because of his status as a visiting professor, Davies
has no recourse to the normal grievance procedures
that guarantee a regular professor the right to appeal.
This rule is clearly an oversight by the University,
which finds itself in an embarrassing position: It
brought a University of London professor half way
around the world and now is not able to give him the
rights other professors enjoy. Even more embarrassing
to Stanford is the fact that one of its professors must
resort to a $3 million suit against 31 History Depart
ment members to force his case to be heard.
The administration must reverse this trend by giving
Davies a chance to appeal. But it must go further and
review policies regarding visiting professors and tenure
decisions in general.

Committees evaluating professors for tenure must
be more accountable for their actions, which after all
are often major decisions in the lives of faculty mem
bers. Individual recommendations and testimony
should of course remain confidential, but a general
statement justifying the committee's decision would
remove some of the mystery and make the group ac
countable to those who are most deeply affected — the
students.
Every faculty member — including visiting profes
sors — should have access to the same grievance pro
cedures. To do otherwise is to deny the democratic
processes for which Stanford supposedly stands.
No one can say for sure whether Davies was denied
the position because of his political beliefs. University
Provost James Rosse says the results of an investiga
tion done "out of courtesy" to Davies show the denial
was based on "partisanship" in describing Polish-
Jewish relations in a recent book. Davies says six
Jewish members of the History Department stood up
and attacked his book in a mysterious January
meeting. Everyone is entitled to know the truth, and
only then will anyone be able to accurately judge
Davies' case.
Some have criticized Davies' decision to sue individ
uals in the History Department rather than the Univer
sity in general. It would seem to make more sense to
attack the University, since it is under its guidelines
that Davies was denied. But the inconsistency is a
symptom of the secrecy surrounding the entire issue.
Now would be a good time to lift the veil and introduce
some accountability into the system.
