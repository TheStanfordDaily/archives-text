## How to best dump the frats 
### 
Let's say you were in charge of housing at a large uni
versity, and decided that you wanted to get rid of
"anachronistic" fraternities and convert all houses on
campus to theme houses. The students, silly little things
that they are, don't know what's good for them and are
against this.
How would you go about it? You can't come right out
and do it — students would riot. But that's okay, time is
cMiypur side. "It makes more sense to use a case by case
oasis . . . than to' abolish alt fraternity housing," at once.

The Zetes are going to step out of line. One down. A
DU did what? All right, another potential theme house. If
people start to get nervous, just say something like, "I
think the University's policy is to have good fraternities."
You can say anything you darn well please, because stu
dents' memories don't last longer than four years.
Oh, those Alpha Delts, they have a "dangerous envi
ronment," and those Theta Delts are on a "fast downhill
slide." But you have to be careful not to let a sense of
community develop. Oh, you SAEs, DKEs and Sigma
Chis are wonderful citizens. For now. Let them relax.
And then you add restrictions. This year, it was no
drinking games, no parties with alcohol themes and no al
cohol at rush parties after 10:30 p.m. Next year maybe no
alcohol at any weekday party after 10:30 and a dry rush.
You just keep making the circle smaller and someone's
going to step outside. You know they will, because you
made everyone in the fraternity responsible for the ac
tions of every member. All you need is maybe five percent
of the people to go overboard, and you get to flush the
whole system.
Once you've got the ball rolling, it gets easier and easier
to kick somebody out for smaller and smaller offenses.
But, you say, what if the three or four remaining fraterni
ties refuse to step out of line and keep huddling in those
little circles you keep drawing for them? Well, realisti
cally, they won't, because there will always be rowdy

people at any university, and they will be naturally drawn
to whatever fraternities exist, and as I've said, you only
need maybe five percent.
But say they obey all of your restrictions — by this time,
no weekday parties and no alcohol served after dinner —
they simply become priority all-male housing. With none
of their former character they will have no student sup
port, and when you put them on the chopping block, no
one will really care.
Meanwhile? you go into places like Yost and tell them
that they are going to become theme houses. (Don't ask
them; after all, they're students and they don't know any
better). Only time it better so they don't have a chance to
scream their heads off. Maybe a week closer to the Draw
next time would do it.
So is the alternative to the active elimination of frater
nities a night sky alight with sirens and burning couches?

No. If the stated policy is to have responsible fraternities
on campus, back it up with some action. Give unhoused
fraternities and sororities an opportunity to move into the
vacated houses. Because if — oh, let's be realistic here —
when fraternities disappear you'll still have rowdy people
on campus. They'll be living right next to the quietest
people.
And, best of all, you'll have students driving off campus
to go drinking. There's a solution to the housing problem.
