Don't let hysteria
curb travel plans
The Cannes Film Festival is
proceeding fine without Rambo,
thank you. Sly Stallone, figuring him
self a certain mark for avenging Viet
Cong terrorists, spared the Cote
D'Azure his arsenal of jittery
bodyguards. Europe is better off
without him, and the rest of the
numbskulls who are canceling their
trips in record numbers. From all I've
read, it sounds like this is the year to
break the piggy bank or hit up the
grandfolks for that summer in
Europe. You'll have the continent to
yourself.
I write this as an ex
researcher/writer for "Let's Go:
Europe," who used to be infuriated
by the behavior of the Ugly American
even as I worked for a guidebook that
occasionally fostered ethnocentrism.
Now I'm exasperated by all the teeth
chattering, spineless behavior in the
face of a miniscule, if increased, risk
of foreign travel.
Syndicated columnist Russell
Baker wrote a few Sundays ago about
the metamorphosis of the Ugly
American into the Chicken Ameri
can. Freaked out by Chernobyl and
by noisy reports that make the
Mideast and Mediterranean out to be
constant bedlam, hordes of
Americans will divert their travel
plans and take to the interstates.
Discussions with the travel consul
tants at the Bcchtel International
Center have led me to believe that
the 'fraidycats are not just oldtimers
reneging on their summer pleasure
cruises. Courageous Stanford stu
dents, who'll face down the Univer
sity police at Old Union sit-ins, are
knuckling under to terrorism.
I suspect the parental lobby may be
pulling rugs out from under some
otherwise sturdy travelers. I well re
member my father's quavering voice
ordering me to leave Cairo one
month and Istanbul the next. Try rea
son. Remind the folks, and yourself,
that on the open road it's always the
other drunken or incompetent
drivers that cause accidents, and that
auto wrecks are equally unpredicta
ble, bloody and lethal.
I know I don't need to pontificate
on the value of foreign travel in
rounding out a college education.
There's no better time than this sum-

mer to take the plunge — air fares are
down and the herds will be on the in
terstates, not on Eurail.

Keep Quad sacred
When I came to Stanford in 1941,
the Quad was an almost sacred place.
Jane Stanford's wish that smoking be
banned there was still respected.
Then the Quad slowly became
slummy. For that, the Stanford com
munity was responsible. A number of
us campaigned vigorously, overcom
ing the apathy and even hostility of
colleagues incapable of recognizing a
slum when they see one. At great ex
pense, the Quad was restored and
became once more a thing of beauty.
And what does the Stanford com
munity do? Set to work at once to
bring back the slum. The protests
against apartheid were largely an ego
trip against authority, so the shacks
were placed outside the president's
office. Those who realize how com
plex the issue is don't resort to those
tactics, so what we have is a kind of
reverse fascism.
Why can't all these activities be
kept in White Plaza (which is now a
slum anyway, except when it is
spruced up for Commencement) or
on the area outside Tresidder? That's
where the crowds are. The Quad,
which is the historical center of the
University, should be a place of quiet
dignity.

Freedom to climb
On May 9, the University made it
illegal to climb on the University
structures. Reasons "of personal
safety and to protect campus
structures from damage and/or
defacement" were given. This is
ridiculous.
Rock climbers from the local area
climb ("builder") on the sandstone
walls of the Quad to train for the real
thing. Now the University has
decided to protect the climbers from
themselves by prohibiting training
here. Thanks, Stanford, but I already

have a grandma to tell me not to do
dangerous things. Besides, the risk
factor of climbing within five feet of
the ground is questionable.
As for reason number two, building
defacement, it seems rather strange
that climbers are damaging the walls
of the buildings with their hands and
feet. Yes, climbers are strong, but. . .
if it's the white chalk marks that have
offended someone, then why not out
law the use of chalk?
Sorry, Stanford, I am going to have
to question authority on this one. But
I am not going to stage a sleep-in with
a hammock slung between the arches
in front of the president's office until
this ridiculous rule is abolished. And I
am not going to organize Stanford
Climbers United for the Right to
Buildfer.

I am not a radical activist. I am not

I am, however, a student who has

other campus anti-apartheid organi

present myself as living proof to the
inaccuracy of Jason Matherly's recent
column (Daily, May 12).
Matherly presumes to speak for
"Stanford students," who, he claims,
see anti-apartheid protesters as
"shack builders, ralliers and marchers
who are little more than nuisances."
Maybe that is all Matherly sees, but
I see a group of students fighting for
human rights and dignity, for the lives
and welfare of a people plagued by
injustice. And in the "eyesores in the
Quad," I see just one small part of
the misery that black South Africans
are forced to endure, and I am

Keep Quad sacred
When I came to Stanford in 1941,
the Quad was an almost sacred place.
Jane Stanford's wish that smoking be
banned there was still respected.
Then the Quad slowly became
slummy. For that, the Stanford com
munity was responsible. A number of
us campaigned vigorously, overcom
ing the apathy and even hostility of
colleagues incapable of recognizing a
slum when they see one. At great ex
pense, the Quad was restored and
became once more a thing of beauty.
And what does the Stanford com
munity do? Set to work at once to
bring back the slum. The protests
against apartheid were largely an ego
trip against authority, so the shacks
were placed outside the president's
office. Those who realize how com
plex the issue is don't resort to those
tactics, so what we have is a kind of
reverse fascism.
Why can't all these activities be
kept in White Plaza (which is now a
slum anyway, except when it is
spruced up for Commencement) or
on the area outside Tresidder? That's
where the crowds are. The Quad,
which is the historical center of the
University, should be a place of quiet
dignity.

Freedom to climb
On May 9, the University made it
illegal to climb on the University
structures. Reasons "of personal
safety and to protect campus
structures from damage and/or
defacement" were given. This is
ridiculous.
Rock climbers from the local area
climb ("builder") on the sandstone
walls of the Quad to train for the real
thing. Now the University has
decided to protect the climbers from
themselves by prohibiting training
here. Thanks, Stanford, but I already

have a grandma to tell me not to do
dangerous things. Besides, the risk
factor of climbing within five feet of
the ground is questionable.
As for reason number two, building
defacement, it seems rather strange
that climbers are damaging the walls
of the buildings with their hands and
feet. Yes, climbers are strong, but. . .
if it's the white chalk marks that have
offended someone, then why not out
law the use of chalk?
Sorry, Stanford, I am going to have
to question authority on this one. But
I am not going to stage a sleep-in with
a hammock slung between the arches
in front of the president's office until
this ridiculous rule is abolished. And I
am not going to organize Stanford
Climbers United for the Right to
Buildfer.

I am not a radical activist. I am not
a member of Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA). I am not even a stu
dent Who has been highly active in the
divestment/anti-apartheid move
ment.
I am, however, a student who has
been informed, enlightened and
moved by the activities of SOSA and
other campus anti-apartheid organi
zations, and as such I would like to
present myself as living proof to the
inaccuracy of Jason Matherly's recent
column (Daily, May 12).
Matherly presumes to speak for
"Stanford students," who, he claims,
see anti-apartheid protesters as
"shack builders, ralliers and marchers
who are little more than nuisances."
Maybe that is all Matherly sees, but
I see a group of students fighting for
human rights and dignity, for the lives
and welfare of a people plagued by
injustice. And in the "eyesores in the
Quad," I see just one small part of
the misery that black South Africans
are forced to endure, and I am
reminded every day as I walk by
those "eyesores" that millions of
people are suffering while we comfor
tably go about our daily business in
this campus haven.
