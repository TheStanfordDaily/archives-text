# Fire, fallout and man's rape of the land

### 
There is a lovely road that runs from Ixopo into
the hills.
The immediate area surrounding the site of the
Soviet nuclear accident is a thinly populated Uk
rainian farming region of wooded steppe and small
villages.
These hills are grass-covered and rolling, and they
are lovely beyond the singing of it.
Large cities, including the metropolitan center of
Kiev, lie within a radius of 70 miles.
The road climbs seven miles into them, to
Carisbrooke; and from there, if there is no mist, you
can look down on one of the fairest valleys in Africa.

The pattern of settlement and types of farming
that can be pieced together from Soviet maps sug
gests that planners picked a site for the Chernobyl
nuclear station in relatively undeveloped territory
near the marshy border between the Soviet Union's
Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics, and yet
within easy access of major urban centers.
About you there is grass and bracken and you
may hear the forlorn cry of the titihoya, one of the
birds of the veld.
Local agriculture focuses on the cultivation of
rye. a hardy grain that prospers in the sandy soils,
and fiber flax as well as dairy farming.
Below you is the valley of the Umzimkulu, on its

journey from the Drakensberg to the sea; and
beyond and behind the river, great hill after great
hill; and beyond and behind them, the mountains of
Ingeli and East Griqualand.
Villages, typically made up of Ukrainian log
cabins with thatched roofs, tend to be small, with
an average population of 500 to 700 people.
The grass is rich and matted, you cannot see the
soil; it holds the rain and the mist, and they seep into
the ground, feeding the streams in every kloof.
The population center most affected by the prob
lem at the nuclear plant would be the town of
Pripyat.
It is well-tended, and not too many cattle feed
upon it; not too many fires burn it, laying bare the
soil.
It was built in the 1970s on a greenfield site near
the Pripyat River.
Stand unshod upon it, for the ground is holy,
being even as it came from the Creator.
The older town of Chernobyl lies 13 miles to the
southeast.
Keep it, guard it, care for it, for it keeps men,
guards men, cares for men; destroy it and man is
destroyed.
In the February 1986 issue of Soviet Life,
Pripyat was portrayed as a typical planned Soviet
town.
Where you stand the grass is rich and matted, you
cannot see the soil.
There are apartment blocks set among pine
groves and flower beds lining its streets.
But the rich green hills break down; they fall to
the valley below, and falling, change their nature.
Unofficial reports indicated hundreds of
casualties in the immediate vicinity of the reactor.
For they grow red and bare; they cannot hold the
rain and mist, and the streams are dry in the kloofs.
The Soviet Union has reported eight people
killed, and many more in hospitals.
Too many cattle feed upon the grass, and too

many fires have burned it.
Western experts said they feared that many who
lived near the plant might have absorbed danger
ous doses of radiation.
Stand shod upon it, for it is coarse and sharp, and
the stones cut under the feet.
Tens of thousands have reportedly evacuated the
area.
It is not kept, or guarded, or cared for, it no longer
keeps men, guards men, cares for men; the titihoya
does not cry here any more.
Shifting winds yesterday blew the radioactive
plumes away from Scandinavia and back toward
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
The great red hills stand desolate, and the earth
has torn away like flesh; the lightning flashes over
them, the clouds pour down upon them, the dead
streams come to life, full of the red blood of the
earth.
Sweden warned against drinking rainwater.
Down in the valleys women scratch the soil that is
left, and the maize hardly reaches the height of a
man.
Poland dispensed iodine tablets to children and
pregnant women in an effort to thwart possible
thyroid poisoning.
They are valleys of old men and old women, of
mothers and children.
Austria warned parents in one province to keep
infants and children indoors.
The men are away, the young men and the girls
are away.
Scientists predicted that land within six miles of
the disabled reactor would be uninhabitable for
generations.
The soil cannot keep them any more.

There is a lovely road that runs from Ixopo into
the hills.
The immediate area surrounding the site of the
Soviet nuclear accident is a thinly populated Uk
rainian farming region of wooded steppe and small
villages.
These hills are grass-covered and rolling, and they
are lovely beyond the singing of it.
Large cities, including the metropolitan center of
Kiev, lie within a radius of 70 miles.
The road climbs seven miles into them, to
Carisbrooke; and from there, if there is no mist, you
can look down on one of the fairest valleys in Africa.

The pattern of settlement and types of farming
that can be pieced together from Soviet maps sug
gests that planners picked a site for the Chernobyl
nuclear station in relatively undeveloped territory
near the marshy border between the Soviet Union's
Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics, and yet
within easy access of major urban centers.
About you there is grass and bracken and you
may hear the forlorn cry of the titihoya, one of the
birds of the veld.
Local agriculture focuses on the cultivation of
rye. a hardy grain that prospers in the sandy soils,
and fiber flax as well as dairy farming.
Below you is the valley of the Umzimkulu, on its

journey from the Drakensberg to the sea; and
beyond and behind the river, great hill after great
hill; and beyond and behind them, the mountains of
Ingeli and East Griqualand.
Villages, typically made up of Ukrainian log
cabins with thatched roofs, tend to be small, with
an average population of 500 to 700 people.
The grass is rich and matted, you cannot see the
soil; it holds the rain and the mist, and they seep into
the ground, feeding the streams in every kloof.
The population center most affected by the prob
lem at the nuclear plant would be the town of
Pripyat.
It is well-tended, and not too many cattle feed
upon it; not too many fires burn it, laying bare the
soil.
It was built in the 1970s on a greenfield site near
the Pripyat River.
Stand unshod upon it, for the ground is holy,
being even as it came from the Creator.
The older town of Chernobyl lies 13 miles to the
southeast.
Keep it, guard it, care for it, for it keeps men,
guards men, cares for men; destroy it and man is
destroyed.
In the February 1986 issue of Soviet Life,
Pripyat was portrayed as a typical planned Soviet
town.
Where you stand the grass is rich and matted, you
cannot see the soil.
There are apartment blocks set among pine
groves and flower beds lining its streets.
But the rich green hills break down; they fall to
the valley below, and falling, change their nature.
Unofficial reports indicated hundreds of
casualties in the immediate vicinity of the reactor.
For they grow red and bare; they cannot hold the
rain and mist, and the streams are dry in the kloofs.
The Soviet Union has reported eight people
killed, and many more in hospitals.
Too many cattle feed upon the grass, and too

many fires have burned it.
Western experts said they feared that many who
lived near the plant might have absorbed danger
ous doses of radiation.
Stand shod upon it, for it is coarse and sharp, and
the stones cut under the feet.
Tens of thousands have reportedly evacuated the
area.
It is not kept, or guarded, or cared for, it no longer
keeps men, guards men, cares for men; the titihoya
does not cry here any more.
Shifting winds yesterday blew the radioactive
plumes away from Scandinavia and back toward
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
The great red hills stand desolate, and the earth
has torn away like flesh; the lightning flashes over
them, the clouds pour down upon them, the dead
streams come to life, full of the red blood of the
earth.
Sweden warned against drinking rainwater.
Down in the valleys women scratch the soil that is
left, and the maize hardly reaches the height of a
man.
Poland dispensed iodine tablets to children and
pregnant women in an effort to thwart possible
thyroid poisoning.
They are valleys of old men and old women, of
mothers and children.
Austria warned parents in one province to keep
infants and children indoors.
The men are away, the young men and the girls
are away.
Scientists predicted that land within six miles of
the disabled reactor would be uninhabitable for
generations.
The soil cannot keep them any more.
