## 'The Mick' won't help Mickey Mantle's bad image 
### MIKE HALE 
"The Mick: An American Hero: the
Legend and the Glory"
Mickey Mantle with Herb Gluck
Jove, $3.95 (paper)
! Of all the great baseball players,
Mickey Mantle is the hardest to bring
into focus. He was undeniably one of
the best of all time; his 1956 and
1957 seasons were the best any hitter
other than Babe Ruth or Ted Wil
liams has ever had. And yet, for the
average fan (and what is more impor
tant, for the non-fan) Mantle's name
doesn't conjure up the sharply
defined image the names of so many
other, lesser ballplayers do.
Part of this is timing. Baseball
mythology breaks down neatly by
decades: the hrst 10 years of the cen
tury were the time of Honus Wagner,
the second 10 of Ty Cobb; Babe Ruth
owned the 19205, Joe DiMaggio the
f 3os, Ted Williams and Stan Musial
the 40s (which should have belonged
to Jackie Robinson). Subsequent

decades have meant Willie Mays,
Mike Schmidt, George Brett. Mickey
Mantle was the greatest ballplayer of
the 19505, and his achievements seem
to have faded in the popular mind
along with everything else belonging
to that decade; Mantle is the Eisen
hower of baseball. He also suffered
from breaking in at the same time as,
and constantly being compared to,
the immensely charismatic Mays
(who wasn't, at their respective
peaks, nearly as good a hitter as
Mantle), and he may have suffered
from too much success; the Yankees
of the '50s were the most dominant
team over a period of time in baseball
history, and for that reason aren't
remembered as fondly as the less con
sistent Yankee teams of the '20s, '30s
and '70s.
But part of the blame, if you can
call it that, must lie with Mantle.
Despite taking some heat his first few
years in the majors — when he was
wrongly perceived as a draft-dodger,
and rightly seen to be taking the place
of Joe DiMaggio, the most revered of

ballplayers — Mantle was never
disliked; in fact, he was wildly
popular with the fans of his time. Pro
fessional observers also liked him; he
won three Most Valuable Player
awards, something only five players
have done. But as much as he im
pressed people with his skill, and won
them over in person, his public image
never really took shape. He was a
simple country boy, but without the
infectiousness of Mays; he was a
carouser and a hell-raiser, but on a
smaller, pettier scale than Ruth; he
didn't have DiMaggio's cool, or Wil
liams' invincibility or Musial's good
ness. He was just Mickey, a great
ballplayer who drank too much and
got hurt a lot — and played in 12
World Series in 14 years.
You would think that his reminis
cences, even "as-told-to," would give
us something on which to build a
picture of Mantle, something we
could use to give him the aura he
didn't create himself. Unfortunately,
"The Mick," beyond being a per
functory and boring book, manages

to make Mantle seem less interesting;
his attitude toward the game appears
so offhand and superficial, and his at
tempts at introspection so half
hearted, that neither the fan nor the
fanatic can take anything away from
the book.
The main impression one gleans
from"The Mick" is of an affectless,
completely unthinking man. This isn't
the same thing as a bad man, by any
means, although Mantle did his share
of bad things; he comes off as the sort
of friend you sigh and shake your
head over, and occasionally avoid in
the best interests of your health and
good name. He describes
"friendships" with showgirls, and all
night, every-night mindbenders with
Billy Martin and Whitey Ford, notes
in passing that these things must have
bothered his wife, and typically
finishes up with a home run hit
despite a tremendous hangover.
There is an alarming matter-of
factness, later in the book, to his
recountings of his serious drinking
bouts, which led to, among other

things, his wife moving out in the win
ter of 1954 and Mantle subsequently
ramming his car into a telephone
pole. "The next day, after 1 sobered
up, Merlyn came back home. And
everything was all right again."
"The Mick" makes it obvious that
Mantle doesn't really care what
people think of him, and probably
couldn't do anything about it if he
did, which goes a long way toward ex
plaining why people don't really
know what to think about him. Per
sonal style, and public images, don't
just happen, they're made; DiMag
gio, a cold, perhaps arrogant, man,
made a legend for himself by acting
the part of the Yankee Clipper,
sailing above the rest of us. Mantle
could never have been bothered with
that; as we find out in the book, noth
ing in life holds for him the fascina
tion of hunting, fishing or playing
baseball, and even those things he
doesn't pursue with the single
mindedness that might make him
sharper in our minds.
"The Mick" contains the usual

store of anecdotes that the serious fan
of baseball, or of Mickey Mantle, will
consider worth the price; but getting
through the book.is a chore. Mantle
runs down his career, year by year,
fills us in on his business ventures,
and throws out a few stories on his
after-hours adventures with Billy
Martin; but everything is told with so
little spirit, and given so little
thought, that the years run together
into one continuous impression of a
country boy — who can play ball and
likes his beer — droning on, on the
front porch (or over the bar) about
the times when. . . . After 250 pages,
this gets old.
"The Mick" was a best-seller in
hardcover; obviously, there are a lot
of people who think sufficiently of
Mantle the ballplayer to want to
know more about Mantle the person.
But playing baseball like a god
doesn't mean you have anything par
ticularly interesting to say; and
Mantle the author doesn't make the
team ahead of, say, Jim Bouton or
even (shudder!) Steve Garvey.
