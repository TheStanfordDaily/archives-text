## Student director Jones takes her 'Red Wagon' on location 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
. This is the second in a series of three
articles on Stanford's graduate film
program and the making of "The Red
Wagon," a movie written and directed
by Kincaid Jones, a member of the
program.
■* Thirty years ago French film critics
came up with a bit of nonsense called
the auteur theory, which held that the
director was a film's auteur, or au
thor. A film's writers, producers and
actors were unimportant, they said. It
was the director who really counted,
since it was he who truly expressed
himself in a film.
Today this notorious piece of er
roneous thinking has been widely dis
credited. Only the most egomaniacal
of directors regard themselves as
auteurs. Most directors are quick to
say that film is a collaborative
medium, and that writers, designers
and actors have a great deal of influ
ence in setting a film's tone.
Director Kincaid Jones, currently
filming "The Red Wagon" to obtain
her master's degree from Stanford,
agrees that the auteur theory is ab
surd because it attributes everything
to a film's director. Though she is ser
ving as writer, director, producer and

editor of her film, Jones values the in
put she receives from her crew mem
bers.
"I'm not an auteur," she says.
"Without the crew a lot of the impor
tant work wouldn't get done."
Jones would in fact prefer to give
up some of the multiple duties she
performs on her film production.
"I don't enjoy planning food for
people. I'd rather be planning
storyboards," she states rather un
equivocally.
Jones is not the only person
working on "The Red Wagon" who
holds more than one position. Be
cause the film has a limited budget, in
the form of a $15,000 fellowship,
there isn't enough money to hire a
large staff. Thus everyone on Jones'
nine-person crew holds at least two
jobs.
During a nine-hour-long shoot one
night in Menlo Park, the crew mem
bers could be seen handling their
various duties with admirable effi
ciency. The scene which is being shot
involves a lonely young boy named
Peter, played by Kevin Matthew Hall,
and his father Stephen, played by Mi
chael O'Brien.
Stephen recently divorced his wife,
causing Peter to become deeply de
pressed. In the scene, father and son

are sitting out in their garage; Step
hen is trying to cheer up Peter. He
flips through a stack of old records
and sings "(I Can't Get No) Satisfac
tion," hoping his son will follow along
on harmonica, but Peter remains
moody and unresponsive.
While this scene might sound
simple, painstaking preparation goes
into it. The shoot is being done on lo
cation at the Menlo Park residence of
Tom Bowman and Carrie Bowes.
The location filming proves to be a
headache for Jones and her crew be
cause they can't control the noises
around them. This is why many films
are shot on soundstages instead of on
location. Perfect quiet is needed for
the dialogue between Peter and Step
hen to be audible.
Time and time again, filming must
be delayed because location sound
recordist Tina DiFeliciantonio picks
up trains, cars and most of all,
airplanes, on her headphones.
DiFeliciantonio describes her job as
being "pretty straightforward." She
records all dialogue and sets up the
microphones.
Her assistant is boom person
Herbie Niles 111 (filling in for Chris
Norte). Niles' duty is to hold a large
boom microphone close enough to
pick up the actors' dialogue while

taking care to stay out of the camera's
frame.
Eventually, the filmmakers decide
that too much time is being lost and
that they must eliminate as many un
wanted noises as they can. For this
reason, Tom Bowman and Carrie
Bowes sit in their house, holding shut
the mouths of their two labrador
retrievers. The dogs, needless to say,
do not appreciate this. An occasional
bark infiltrates the soundtrack.
Equally important, but less time
consuming than sound recording and
microphone placement, is the scene's
lighting arrangement. Apart from
boosting the crew's morale with his
sense of humor, assistant cameraman
Rich McKay loads and cleans the Ar
riflex camera being used.
McKay, who has worked on Stan
ford film productions for about three
years, makes sure the camera's bat
teries are charged; obviously it would
be a disaster if anything were to go
wrong with the camera. He also takes
light readings on the set, which helps
in deciding where the lights will be set
up.
McKay frequently consults with
Jay Clements, the film's cinematog
rapher and head cameraman. Cle
ments, another member of Stanford's
graduate film program, is serving as
cinematographer on Jones' film while
Jones does the same on a film Cle
ments is directing.

Clements' film, she says, is a docu
mentary about "the pains and pres
sures of being an American male
from a woman's perspective." Jones
and she decided to work on each
other's films because they both felt it
would be good experience, and be
cause they feel they share a similar
visual style.
The entire crew — Jones, the
sound people, the camera operators
— focus their respective efforts on
the actors and the set. While all the
technical aspects of filming are being
readied, actors O'Brien and Hall sit
on milk crates in the garage set, trying
to ignore the chill in the air.
When not rehearsing or talking
with director Jones, O'Brien and Hall
provide an interesting contrast in
generations: while O'Brien flips
through a stack of old records and
muses about the week when the
Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper" album came
out, 12-year-old Hall sings Falco's
"Rock Me Amadeus" to himself.
Brigid Tuescher, script and conti
nuity person, keeps a careful eye on
the set and the actors. She keeps
precise track of where everything is
positioned in each take, to ensure
that continuity is maintained. For in
stance, Tuescher notes whether or
not the actors had their hands in their
pockets during the last take, where
the props were located, and so on.
She also times every take and com

ments on each one in a notebook,
which will be helpful to Jones in the
editing stage.
Finally the cameras are ready to
roll, and Jones says the magic word —
"Action!" The actors finally get to
act. Considering the lateness of the
hour and the fact that this is his first
film, the young Hall does very well.
A Palo Alto native, Hall has per
formed in the Palo Alto Children's
Theatre and the California Theatre
Center. With hopes of becoming a
professional actor, he says he decided
to act "not for money, but because
it's fun to perform in front of people,
making them laugh."
At close to 3 a.m., filming is com
pleted. The dogs can now bark to
their hearts' content. For Jones, the
use of this location was something of
a coup. She had driven around the
area for four days looking for the
right type of residence before dis
covering this Menlo Park house. She
used a similar tactic for an earlier
shoot in Northern California. Driving
around the Sierra foothills, she came
across a vineyard owned by John Fer
rero, and gained permission to use it
for a Christmas scene.
But despite having completed two
location shoots, Jones and her crew
can't relax quite yet. Still ahead are
scenes to be shot in Mill Valley and
San Francisco.

■* Thirty years ago French film critics
came up with a bit of nonsense called
the auteur theory, which held that the
director was a film's auteur, or au
thor. A film's writers, producers and
actors were unimportant, they said. It
was the director who really counted,
since it was he who truly expressed
himself in a film.
Today this notorious piece of er
roneous thinking has been widely dis
credited. Only the most egomaniacal
of directors regard themselves as
auteurs. Most directors are quick to
say that film is a collaborative
medium, and that writers, designers
and actors have a great deal of influ
ence in setting a film's tone.
Director Kincaid Jones, currently
filming "The Red Wagon" to obtain
her master's degree from Stanford,
agrees that the auteur theory is ab
surd because it attributes everything
to a film's director. Though she is ser
ving as writer, director, producer and

editor of her film, Jones values the in
put she receives from her crew mem
bers.
"I'm not an auteur," she says.
"Without the crew a lot of the impor
tant work wouldn't get done."
Jones would in fact prefer to give
up some of the multiple duties she
performs on her film production.
"I don't enjoy planning food for
people. I'd rather be planning
storyboards," she states rather un
equivocally.
Jones is not the only person
working on "The Red Wagon" who
holds more than one position. Be
cause the film has a limited budget, in
the form of a $15,000 fellowship,
there isn't enough money to hire a
large staff. Thus everyone on Jones'
nine-person crew holds at least two
jobs.
During a nine-hour-long shoot one
night in Menlo Park, the crew mem
bers could be seen handling their
various duties with admirable effi
ciency. The scene which is being shot
involves a lonely young boy named
Peter, played by Kevin Matthew Hall,
and his father Stephen, played by Mi
chael O'Brien.
Stephen recently divorced his wife,
causing Peter to become deeply de
pressed. In the scene, father and son

are sitting out in their garage; Step
hen is trying to cheer up Peter. He
flips through a stack of old records
and sings "(I Can't Get No) Satisfac
tion," hoping his son will follow along
on harmonica, but Peter remains
moody and unresponsive.
While this scene might sound
simple, painstaking preparation goes
into it. The shoot is being done on lo
cation at the Menlo Park residence of
Tom Bowman and Carrie Bowes.
The location filming proves to be a
headache for Jones and her crew be
cause they can't control the noises
around them. This is why many films
are shot on soundstages instead of on
location. Perfect quiet is needed for
the dialogue between Peter and Step
hen to be audible.
Time and time again, filming must
be delayed because location sound
recordist Tina DiFeliciantonio picks
up trains, cars and most of all,
airplanes, on her headphones.
DiFeliciantonio describes her job as
being "pretty straightforward." She
records all dialogue and sets up the
microphones.
Her assistant is boom person
Herbie Niles 111 (filling in for Chris
Norte). Niles' duty is to hold a large
boom microphone close enough to
pick up the actors' dialogue while

taking care to stay out of the camera's
frame.
Eventually, the filmmakers decide
that too much time is being lost and
that they must eliminate as many un
wanted noises as they can. For this
reason, Tom Bowman and Carrie
Bowes sit in their house, holding shut
the mouths of their two labrador
retrievers. The dogs, needless to say,
do not appreciate this. An occasional
bark infiltrates the soundtrack.
Equally important, but less time
consuming than sound recording and
microphone placement, is the scene's
lighting arrangement. Apart from
boosting the crew's morale with his
sense of humor, assistant cameraman
Rich McKay loads and cleans the Ar
riflex camera being used.
McKay, who has worked on Stan
ford film productions for about three
years, makes sure the camera's bat
teries are charged; obviously it would
be a disaster if anything were to go
wrong with the camera. He also takes
light readings on the set, which helps
in deciding where the lights will be set
up.
McKay frequently consults with
Jay Clements, the film's cinematog
rapher and head cameraman. Cle
ments, another member of Stanford's
graduate film program, is serving as
cinematographer on Jones' film while
Jones does the same on a film Cle
ments is directing.

Clements' film, she says, is a docu
mentary about "the pains and pres
sures of being an American male
from a woman's perspective." Jones
and she decided to work on each
other's films because they both felt it
would be good experience, and be
cause they feel they share a similar
visual style.
The entire crew — Jones, the
sound people, the camera operators
— focus their respective efforts on
the actors and the set. While all the
technical aspects of filming are being
readied, actors O'Brien and Hall sit
on milk crates in the garage set, trying
to ignore the chill in the air.
When not rehearsing or talking
with director Jones, O'Brien and Hall
provide an interesting contrast in
generations: while O'Brien flips
through a stack of old records and
muses about the week when the
Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper" album came
out, 12-year-old Hall sings Falco's
"Rock Me Amadeus" to himself.
Brigid Tuescher, script and conti
nuity person, keeps a careful eye on
the set and the actors. She keeps
precise track of where everything is
positioned in each take, to ensure
that continuity is maintained. For in
stance, Tuescher notes whether or
not the actors had their hands in their
pockets during the last take, where
the props were located, and so on.
She also times every take and com

ments on each one in a notebook,
which will be helpful to Jones in the
editing stage.
Finally the cameras are ready to
roll, and Jones says the magic word —
"Action!" The actors finally get to
act. Considering the lateness of the
hour and the fact that this is his first
film, the young Hall does very well.
A Palo Alto native, Hall has per
formed in the Palo Alto Children's
Theatre and the California Theatre
Center. With hopes of becoming a
professional actor, he says he decided
to act "not for money, but because
it's fun to perform in front of people,
making them laugh."
At close to 3 a.m., filming is com
pleted. The dogs can now bark to
their hearts' content. For Jones, the
use of this location was something of
a coup. She had driven around the
area for four days looking for the
right type of residence before dis
covering this Menlo Park house. She
used a similar tactic for an earlier
shoot in Northern California. Driving
around the Sierra foothills, she came
across a vineyard owned by John Fer
rero, and gained permission to use it
for a Christmas scene.
But despite having completed two
location shoots, Jones and her crew
can't relax quite yet. Still ahead are
scenes to be shot in Mill Valley and
San Francisco.
