## Kendall lives life in the fast lane 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Stanford junior Bart Kendall has an In
teresting weekend hobby.
He races car*. Professionally.
Along with his father Chuck, who
ibares Bart's name (they are Charles
Barton Kendall II and 111, respectively),
and -younger brother Tom, Kendall com
petes throughout the country in various
pro series in the Internationa! Motor

Sports Association (IMSA) and the Sports
Car Club of America (SCCA).
Bart, a native of La Canada, spends
nearly every weekend racing, primarily in
Californiu. Two weeks ago it was Laguna
Seca in Monterey, before that it was
Riverside, Long Beach, Phoenix and
others. Next week it's Riverside again.
Then New York - a 24-hour endurance
race following finals week at Stanford. You
get the idea.
"It's tough," Kendall said. " This quarter

I'll be gone seven of 10 weekends. 1 miss
Fridays all day. because I practice Friday,
qualify Suturday and race on Sunday.
Sometimes I wish I was here on weekends.
It would be kind of fun, but this is what I
want to do most."
How does he find the time for such a de
manding sport? Well, the member of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity is taking 15
units this quarter — and mixing academies
and motor sports hasn't proven a difficulty
in the past. "Last spring when I was racing

I got my best grades ever," Bart explained.
• | don't know how that worked out."
Bart picked up the sport at a young age
when his father took up racing as a hobby
eight years ago "When he started driving
professionally, my brother, my mom and I
would go to races with him. Ever sinee I
was 14 I went to races in the summer," he
said.
The next step was driving school. Not
quite like your normal high school driving
class, however. Between Bart's junior and

senior wars of high school, he attended the
Bob Bondurant School of High Perfor
mance Driving, a four-day course teaching
the basics of racing with street cars.
Following his senior year. Kendall got
his novice license and competed in some
amateur events, including a three-hour en
durance race in a Porsche with his father.
The pair finished second in their class.
Then came Stanford. The economics

major attended the Jim Russell School of
Motor Racing during spring of his fresh
man year and entered six races that year.
His sophomore year, Kendall had his first
professional race during spring break — at
Sebring, Fla. Bart, on crutches with a
sprained ankle from a finals week basket
ball game, teamed up with younger
brother Tom to finish second in his class in
the 12-hour endurance race.
"You can't call the team of Ken
dall/Kendall inexperienced any more," On
Track magazine reported. "They survived
12 hours of Sebring . . . the two were in
their second and first professional race,
respectively, and are sons of racing veteran
Chuck Kendall.
Kendall raced in five events in that RX
-7 IMSA series and finished eighth in
points. This year, after returning from a
winter quarter in Italy, he has run into
some bad luck — literally. "At Long
Beach 1 did well in the qualifying," Ken
dall explained,"but coming out of the first
lap I got hit and was out of the race."
Three weeks ago at Riverside, Bart had
another scary experience. Going 110 to
115 mph coming out of a turn, his RX-7
suddenly snapped around, and Kendall
found himself going backwards down the
track and did a 360 right in front of the pit.
The wing had come off the rear of the car.
"I lost 15 minutes in the pit when I would
have been battling for first," he said.
Recently, Kendall has moved up to the
prototype cars, the Camel Light Series,
driving a Mazda Lola. He and his father
finished fourth at Riverside, then sixth at
Monterey last week, despite being hit on
the first lap once again.
Racing is definitely in Bart's future
plans. "Next year I'd like to concentrate

on racing," he said, "do a whole year in
one series so I can get a good idea where 1
stand, see if there's any future in it at all.
I've thought about going back to Italy and
see how I'd do. It's really competitive in
Europe, but I've got lots of time. I'd like to
do this as long as I could — over anything
else right now."
Kendall has been unable to race every
race the entire year because of school and
also because of the high cost of the sport.
Without sponsorship, expenses can run as
high as $250,000 to $300,000 a year.
Chuck Kendall is currently sponsoring
himself as well as his eldest son.
"Sponsorship is the main thing," Bart
said. "That's a lot out of my dad's pocket. I
couldn't afford a whole year of racing. I've
been very fortunate with my dad helping
out and everything. I almost feel a little
guilty, he's done so much to make it easy
for us. My dad is responsible for where I
am today.
Chuck Kendall stresses the importance
of his sons' education.
"Their first priority is to do well in
school," he said. "As long as they do that
I'm willing to help them. Racing should be
up to a certain point a vocation, but
they should have an education so they
have another way to go."
Younger brother Tom, a sophomore at
UCLA, has been able to race a full season
this year because of sponsorship from
Mazda.
"I'm doing well," Tom reported from
UCLA. "I've always been very into it
(racing). It's always been the No. 1 thing
for me. When Bart first started, I didn't
think he wanted to do it that much, but this
year he's doing real well and started to
take it seriously. He's improved 100 per
cent.
"Bart's always dominated me in ath
letics all my life," Tom Kendall finished,
"because he's always been older. I get my

revenge racing. But it's evening up —
Bart's catching up quite a bit. I'm starting
to sweat it."
"Bart is every bit as serious in his way as
Tom, " father Chuck explained, "but he's
a little more directed as far as school is
concerned, more involved. Bart's a very
competitive person, and he's made a big
improvement."
Safety is always a concern in auto racing,
but the equipment used in the sport is very
reliable. "People really don't know that
much about it," Bart said. "The safety
equipment is so good, it's very rare that
any one gets hurt.
The member of the Kendall family with
the most cause for worry is Claire Kendall,
Bart's mother, who has to live with her
husband and her two eldest sons racing at
speeds up to 160 mph. Her other two
children, Mike (18) and John (12) have
also shown interest in the sport.
"The start is the worst, the end is the
best," Kendall's mother said. "I've gotten
used to it but I don't think I'll ever be to
tally relaxed. I'd prefer Bart to play golf,
but you can't choose for them."
Bart thinks his mother handles the fam
ily interest well. "She takes it really, really
well," he said. "She knows it's important
to us. At family dinners, conversation al
ways turns to racing.
The Kendall men gave the self
described "oddball" of the clan a race
driving course as a present a few years
back, but Claire is one member of the fam
ily who will not be seen on the track in
years to come. "I decided I never wanted
to race," she said, "It's too scary. I would
have been a real menace."
Claire Kendall admits that she's stopped
listening to those dinner conversations and
has recently taken up knitting to pass the
time at races. "I've started on a sweater
already," she reported, "I just put in my
earplugs and knit."

The member of the Kendall family with
the most cause for worry is Claire Kendall,
Bart's mother, who has to live with her
husband and her two eldest sons racing at

Bart thinks his mother handles the fam

The Kendall men gave the self

Stanford junior Bart Kendall has an In

He races car*. Professionally.
Along with his father Chuck, who
ibares Bart's name (they are Charles
Barton Kendall II and 111, respectively),
and -younger brother Tom, Kendall com
petes throughout the country in various
pro series in the Internationa! Motor

Sports Association (IMSA) and the Sports
Car Club of America (SCCA).
Bart, a native of La Canada, spends
nearly every weekend racing, primarily in
Californiu. Two weeks ago it was Laguna
Seca in Monterey, before that it was
Riverside, Long Beach, Phoenix and
others. Next week it's Riverside again.
Then New York - a 24-hour endurance
race following finals week at Stanford. You
get the idea.
"It's tough," Kendall said. " This quarter

I'll be gone seven of 10 weekends. 1 miss
Fridays all day. because I practice Friday,
qualify Suturday and race on Sunday.
Sometimes I wish I was here on weekends.
It would be kind of fun, but this is what I
want to do most."
How does he find the time for such a de
manding sport? Well, the member of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity is taking 15
units this quarter — and mixing academies
and motor sports hasn't proven a difficulty
in the past. "Last spring when I was racing

I got my best grades ever," Bart explained.
• | don't know how that worked out."
Bart picked up the sport at a young age
when his father took up racing as a hobby
eight years ago "When he started driving
professionally, my brother, my mom and I
would go to races with him. Ever sinee I
was 14 I went to races in the summer," he
said.
The next step was driving school. Not
quite like your normal high school driving
class, however. Between Bart's junior and

senior wars of high school, he attended the
Bob Bondurant School of High Perfor
mance Driving, a four-day course teaching
the basics of racing with street cars.
Following his senior year. Kendall got
his novice license and competed in some
amateur events, including a three-hour en
durance race in a Porsche with his father.
The pair finished second in their class.

major attended the Jim Russell School of
Motor Racing during spring of his fresh
man year and entered six races that year.
His sophomore year, Kendall had his first
professional race during spring break — at
Sebring, Fla. Bart, on crutches with a
sprained ankle from a finals week basket
ball game, teamed up with younger
brother Tom to finish second in his class in
the 12-hour endurance race.
"You can't call the team of Ken
dall/Kendall inexperienced any more," On
Track magazine reported. "They survived
12 hours of Sebring . . . the two were in
their second and first professional race,
respectively, and are sons of racing veteran
Chuck Kendall.
Kendall raced in five events in that RX
-7 IMSA series and finished eighth in
points. This year, after returning from a
winter quarter in Italy, he has run into
some bad luck — literally. "At Long
Beach 1 did well in the qualifying," Ken
dall explained,"but coming out of the first
lap I got hit and was out of the race."
Three weeks ago at Riverside, Bart had
another scary experience. Going 110 to
115 mph coming out of a turn, his RX-7
suddenly snapped around, and Kendall
found himself going backwards down the
track and did a 360 right in front of the pit.
The wing had come off the rear of the car.
"I lost 15 minutes in the pit when I would
have been battling for first," he said.
Recently, Kendall has moved up to the
prototype cars, the Camel Light Series,
driving a Mazda Lola. He and his father
finished fourth at Riverside, then sixth at
Monterey last week, despite being hit on
the first lap once again.
Racing is definitely in Bart's future
plans. "Next year I'd like to concentrate

on racing," he said, "do a whole year in
one series so I can get a good idea where 1
stand, see if there's any future in it at all.
I've thought about going back to Italy and
see how I'd do. It's really competitive in
Europe, but I've got lots of time. I'd like to
do this as long as I could — over anything
else right now."
Kendall has been unable to race every
race the entire year because of school and
also because of the high cost of the sport.
Without sponsorship, expenses can run as
high as $250,000 to $300,000 a year.
Chuck Kendall is currently sponsoring
himself as well as his eldest son.
"Sponsorship is the main thing," Bart
said. "That's a lot out of my dad's pocket. I
couldn't afford a whole year of racing. I've
been very fortunate with my dad helping
out and everything. I almost feel a little
guilty, he's done so much to make it easy
for us. My dad is responsible for where I
am today.
Chuck Kendall stresses the importance
of his sons' education.
"Their first priority is to do well in
school," he said. "As long as they do that
I'm willing to help them. Racing should be
up to a certain point a vocation, but
they should have an education so they
have another way to go."
Younger brother Tom, a sophomore at
UCLA, has been able to race a full season
this year because of sponsorship from
Mazda.
"I'm doing well," Tom reported from
UCLA. "I've always been very into it
(racing). It's always been the No. 1 thing
for me. When Bart first started, I didn't
think he wanted to do it that much, but this
year he's doing real well and started to
take it seriously. He's improved 100 per
cent.
"Bart's always dominated me in ath
letics all my life," Tom Kendall finished,
"because he's always been older. I get my

revenge racing. But it's evening up —
Bart's catching up quite a bit. I'm starting
to sweat it."
"Bart is every bit as serious in his way as
Tom, " father Chuck explained, "but he's
a little more directed as far as school is
concerned, more involved. Bart's a very
competitive person, and he's made a big
improvement."
Safety is always a concern in auto racing,

guilty, he's done so much to make it easy
for us. My dad is responsible for where I
am today.
Chuck Kendall stresses the importance
of his sons' education.
"Their first priority is to do well in
school," he said. "As long as they do that
I'm willing to help them. Racing should be
up to a certain point a vocation, but
they should have an education so they
have another way to go."
Younger brother Tom, a sophomore at
UCLA, has been able to race a full season
this year because of sponsorship from
Mazda.
"I'm doing well," Tom reported from
UCLA. "I've always been very into it
(racing). It's always been the No. 1 thing
for me. When Bart first started, I didn't
think he wanted to do it that much, but this
year he's doing real well and started to
take it seriously. He's improved 100 per
cent.
"Bart's always dominated me in ath
letics all my life," Tom Kendall finished,
"because he's always been older. I get my

revenge racing. But it's evening up —
Bart's catching up quite a bit. I'm starting
to sweat it."
"Bart is every bit as serious in his way as
Tom, " father Chuck explained, "but he's
a little more directed as far as school is
concerned, more involved. Bart's a very
competitive person, and he's made a big
improvement."
Safety is always a concern in auto racing,
but the equipment used in the sport is very
reliable. "People really don't know that
much about it," Bart said. "The safety
equipment is so good, it's very rare that
any one gets hurt.
The member of the Kendall family with
the most cause for worry is Claire Kendall,
Bart's mother, who has to live with her
husband and her two eldest sons racing at
speeds up to 160 mph. Her other two
children, Mike (18) and John (12) have
also shown interest in the sport.
"The start is the worst, the end is the
best," Kendall's mother said. "I've gotten
used to it but I don't think I'll ever be to
tally relaxed. I'd prefer Bart to play golf,
but you can't choose for them."
Bart thinks his mother handles the fam
ily interest well. "She takes it really, really
well," he said. "She knows it's important
to us. At family dinners, conversation al
ways turns to racing.
The Kendall men gave the self
described "oddball" of the clan a race
driving course as a present a few years
back, but Claire is one member of the fam
ily who will not be seen on the track in
years to come. "I decided I never wanted
to race," she said, "It's too scary. I would
have been a real menace."
Claire Kendall admits that she's stopped
listening to those dinner conversations and
has recently taken up knitting to pass the
time at races. "I've started on a sweater
already," she reported, "I just put in my
earplugs and knit."
