## Kendall lives life in the fast lane 
### SUSAN SLUSSER Staff writer 
Stanford junior Bart Kendall has an In
teresting weekend hobby.
He races car*. Professionally.
Along with his father Chuck, who
ibares Bart's name (they are Charles
Barton Kendall II and 111, respectively),
and -younger brother Tom, Kendall com
petes throughout the country in various
pro series in the Internationa! Motor

Sports Association (IMSA) and the Sports
Car Club of America (SCCA).
Bart, a native of La Canada, spends
nearly every weekend racing, primarily in
Californiu. Two weeks ago it was Laguna
Seca in Monterey, before that it was
Riverside, Long Beach, Phoenix and
others. Next week it's Riverside again.
Then New York - a 24-hour endurance
race following finals week at Stanford. You
get the idea.
"It's tough," Kendall said. " This quarter

I'll be gone seven of 10 weekends. 1 miss
Fridays all day. because I practice Friday,
qualify Suturday and race on Sunday.
Sometimes I wish I was here on weekends.
It would be kind of fun, but this is what I
want to do most."
How does he find the time for such a de
manding sport? Well, the member of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity is taking 15
units this quarter — and mixing academies
and motor sports hasn't proven a difficulty
in the past. "Last spring when I was racing

I got my best grades ever," Bart explained.
• | don't know how that worked out."
Bart picked up the sport at a young age
when his father took up racing as a hobby
eight years ago "When he started driving
professionally, my brother, my mom and I
would go to races with him. Ever sinee I
was 14 I went to races in the summer," he
said.
The next step was driving school. Not
quite like your normal high school driving
class, however. Between Bart's junior and

senior wars of high school, he attended the
Bob Bondurant School of High Perfor
mance Driving, a four-day course teaching
the basics of racing with street cars.
Following his senior year. Kendall got
his novice license and competed in some
amateur events, including a three-hour en
durance race in a Porsche with his father.
The pair finished second in their class.
Then came Stanford. The economics


Auto racing is a family tradition for the Kendalls. Bart, a Stanford Junior, and his brother Tom a UCLA have joined their father Chuck on the IMSA and SCCA circults.
