# Women open against Harvard

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas — The University of Texas will
literally and figuratively be the hotbed of college
women's tennis for the next week as the nation's
top teams and individuals gather for the NCAA
championships amidst sweltering temperatures in
the new Texas tennis stadium.
The battle for the team championship will begin
today as the country's 16 best teams square off in
first-round action. Stanford, seeded No. 1 in the
tournament, will play at 8:30 this morning on the
Texas intramural courts against Harvard, whose
players are also taking their final exams in Texas.
As Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said, the Crim
son should have ample time to study after today.
."It's not going to be a real great workout," Bren
nan said of the Cardinal's first-round match. "The
worry is that you don't fall asleep."
Last year, Stanford was in a similar position,
seeded No. 1 and opening against Harvard. The
Cardinal demolished the Crimson before being
shocked by Trinity — the No. 8 seed — in the
second round.
"They (the Stanford players) are anxious for the
opportunity to rectify last year," Brennan said. "It
was a very unusual experience to be out of the
tournament that early. Everybody felt that it was
their fault. They were really down."
Several factors have given Brennan reason to be
confident as the Cardinal seeks to regain the cham

pionship it won in 1982 and 1984. "We've had a
great season," he said Monday. "We're as ready as
we can be. A lot of teams are more injury-ridden.
Some teams are flat and stale. We're pretty rested
because we don't play 35 or 40 matches during the
season.
We've had very good practices," Brennan added.
"I'm not pushing them to the point where they're
starting to wear down."
Stanford's depth — which was most evident this
season when No. 2 singles player Eleni Rossides
went down with shin splints and sophomore Cari
Hagey filled in at No. 6 with a near-perfect singles
record — could distinguish the team from the rest
of the field this weekend.
"We've had times when even two players have
not played well, and we've still won because of our
depth and power," Brennan said. "I feel like we're
one of the best teams. We're a hot and cold team.
We've had players play well one day and not so
well the next."
The Cardinal should not have to worry about in
consistencies in the Austin weather. Earlier this
week, the thermometer reached 95 degrees, and
the temperature is expected to remain at that level
throughout the tournament.
"I think it (the weather) will help us," Brennan
said. "It'll help loosen up some sore muscles.
We've played at Texas this year, and we kind of
like it down there."
To capture the title, Stanford will have to
overcome a highly competitive field, which in

eludes, in order, the No. 2 through No. 8 seeds:
USC, Trinity, California, Miami, San Diego State,
Clemson and UCLA.
If the Cardinal avoids being stunned by Harvard,
it will most likely face UCLA in tomorrow's quar
terfinals. Two weekends ago, Stanford narrowly
edged the Bruins 5-4 in Westwood.
"UCLA has finished real strong," Brennan said.
"They're a threat.
"The second round is where you really get into
heavy traffic," he added. "You can get caught off
guard. Trinity was really good last year. The second
match gets you ready. If you can get through that
match, you're in the semis. Once you get to the
finals, I think it's gravy. You have more pressure
when you're supposed to win."
If the seedings are an accurate reflection of the
nation's best teams, Stanford should meet USC in
what would certainly be a tremendous final. The
Trojans are No. 1 in the national rankings despite
being the second seed in the tournament.
The two teams have dominated college tennis
during the 1980s, with the Cardinal winning the
title in '82 and '84 and the Trojans in '83 and '85.
This season, USC handed Stanford its only dual
match loss by a 6-3 score on April 4 in Los An
geles. The Cardinal returned the favor April 19
with a 5-4 victory at Stanford.
Brennan indicated that the key to a Cardinal vic
tory over USC should the two teams meet in the


Patty Fendick will lead the top-seeded Cardinal into first-round action
at the NCAAs today in Austin, Texas. According to Stanford Coach

Todd Sitrin/Daily file
Frank Brennan, his No. 1 plaver has "still got her best tennis ahead of
her."
