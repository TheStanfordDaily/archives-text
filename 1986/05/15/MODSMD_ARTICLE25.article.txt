He walked briskly to the public,
phone at the corner. His eyes —
those beady, nervous orbs of ter
ror — scrutinized the phone
receiver ahead of him. It was get
ting late.
The phone rang. The man in the
tweed coat and raybans jumped up
and reached quickly for the
receiver— his heart pounding.
"Is it safe?" he asked breath
lessly. There was hesitation. Oh,
the agony of it all. "It was simply
not honest," he thought to him
self. "What would mother think?"
His thoughts vanished as soon
as he heard the voice, a deep, sa
tanical whisper that sounded like
Linda Blair with a nasal condition.
"It is safe," the voice hissed.
"You and your friend will draft
first and second. Go now, leave
me in peace, chowderhead." The
voice faded.

The burden lifted, the man left
the booth and ran towards the car
parked at the corner. "How did it
go. Pat?" the driver asked. "Fine,
Red, just fine," Pat answered,
wiping his brow.
Together, Pat Williams
(Philadelphia general manager)
and Red Auerbach (the Boston
GM) drove off into the distance —
comfortable, satisfied and very
much guaranteed.
What you have heard is only
one individual's biased account of
what he thought might have hap
pened. Perhaps it could be a tad
bit far-fetched, or worse yet,
simply wrong.
The cold hard fact, nevertheless,
remains: Both Philadelphia and
Boston will improve considerably
after their 1986 draft selection,
whether it be a Chris Washburn, a
Len Bias or even a Brad Daugh
erty. Oh well, at least Cleveland
— a perennial doormat — gets to
pick eighth.
Still, there does exist some hope
for the rest of the league. That is,
maybe these Eastern Egg selec
tions will refuse to play for either
of them. It has happened before,
albeit not as often in the NBA as
the NFL.
Suppose Len Bias of Maryland
gives Boston a thumbs down, and
decides that he wishes to play in

Cleveland. Ridiculous?
Not really. Let's look at the
NFL's history of what will be now
referred to as draftee downtown
disdain. Hey, that's an alliteration.
The newspaper headlines read,
"Kosar gets his wish —
Cleveland." Strange. Here's
Bemie Kosar, a highly touted
recruit out of the University of
Miami a few years ago, expressing
his desire to play for Cleveland in
stead of Minnesota.
Cleveland's a nice place, I guess.
Cold in the winter, stifling
humidity in the summer. But that
doesn't matter; Cleveland has so
much more than just weather.
Why, every city has weather.
Indeed, Cleveland has more. They
have bowling alleys, topless
bowling alleys and just some plain
alleys. If it's all right with Bemie,
it's all right with me — that's a
credo to stand by.
Now, will a Len Bias jump on
the Bernie bandwagon and head
towards industrial Utopia? Before
answering, let's look at other ex
amples.
When John Elway entered the
league out of Leland Stanford
University, he chose not to play
for the then-Baltimore Colts (now
the Indianapolis Colts), opting for
the Denver Broncos instead.
Seattle drafted Tony Dorsett
only to hear him plead for the
Cowboys of Dallas.
Once more, the envelope
please. Will Philly's and Boston's
top choices go elsewhere, ex
emplifying the acclaimed draftee
downtown disdain? Are you kid
ding? Go Philly, way to go Boston.
Draft Recommendations
With their No. 1 pick,
Philadelphia will probably go for
the elusive "Big Man." Everyone
points to Brad Daugherty. I ask
why?
Daugherty, a center at North
Carolina, had a solid, though un
spectacular season. His defense is
suspect, and he has questionable
inside strength. Philly will prob
ably draft him anyway, a mistake
that they will eventually realize.
Boston, on the other hand, will
do no wrong with Bias. A scorer
and a rebounder in college, Bias
will give the Celtics that definitive
small forward that can get up and
down the floor.
Then there's Golden State. Fi
nally, after suffering the injustice
of last year's draft, the Warriors
should find a blue chipper with
their third pick. That man should
be Auburn's Chuck Person.

He walked briskly to the public,
phone at the corner. His eyes —
those beady, nervous orbs of ter
ror — scrutinized the phone
receiver ahead of him. It was get
ting late.
The phone rang. The man in the
tweed coat and raybans jumped up
and reached quickly for the
receiver— his heart pounding.
"Is it safe?" he asked breath
lessly. There was hesitation. Oh,
the agony of it all. "It was simply
not honest," he thought to him
self. "What would mother think?"
His thoughts vanished as soon
as he heard the voice, a deep, sa
tanical whisper that sounded like
Linda Blair with a nasal condition.
"It is safe," the voice hissed.
"You and your friend will draft
first and second. Go now, leave
me in peace, chowderhead." The
voice faded.

The burden lifted, the man left
the booth and ran towards the car
parked at the corner. "How did it
go. Pat?" the driver asked. "Fine,
Red, just fine," Pat answered,
wiping his brow.
Together, Pat Williams
(Philadelphia general manager)
and Red Auerbach (the Boston
GM) drove off into the distance —
comfortable, satisfied and very
much guaranteed.
What you have heard is only
one individual's biased account of
what he thought might have hap
pened. Perhaps it could be a tad
bit far-fetched, or worse yet,
simply wrong.
The cold hard fact, nevertheless,
remains: Both Philadelphia and
Boston will improve considerably
after their 1986 draft selection,
whether it be a Chris Washburn, a
Len Bias or even a Brad Daugh
erty. Oh well, at least Cleveland
— a perennial doormat — gets to
pick eighth.
Still, there does exist some hope
for the rest of the league. That is,
maybe these Eastern Egg selec
tions will refuse to play for either
of them. It has happened before,
albeit not as often in the NBA as
the NFL.
Suppose Len Bias of Maryland
gives Boston a thumbs down, and
decides that he wishes to play in

Cleveland. Ridiculous?
Not really. Let's look at the
NFL's history of what will be now
referred to as draftee downtown
disdain. Hey, that's an alliteration.
The newspaper headlines read,
"Kosar gets his wish —
Cleveland." Strange. Here's
Bemie Kosar, a highly touted
recruit out of the University of
Miami a few years ago, expressing
his desire to play for Cleveland in
stead of Minnesota.
Cleveland's a nice place, I guess.
Cold in the winter, stifling
humidity in the summer. But that
doesn't matter; Cleveland has so
much more than just weather.
Why, every city has weather.
Indeed, Cleveland has more. They
have bowling alleys, topless
bowling alleys and just some plain
alleys. If it's all right with Bemie,
it's all right with me — that's a
credo to stand by.
Now, will a Len Bias jump on
the Bernie bandwagon and head
towards industrial Utopia? Before
answering, let's look at other ex
amples.
When John Elway entered the
league out of Leland Stanford
University, he chose not to play
for the then-Baltimore Colts (now
the Indianapolis Colts), opting for
the Denver Broncos instead.
Seattle drafted Tony Dorsett
only to hear him plead for the
Cowboys of Dallas.
Once more, the envelope
please. Will Philly's and Boston's
top choices go elsewhere, ex
emplifying the acclaimed draftee
downtown disdain? Are you kid
ding? Go Philly, way to go Boston.
Draft Recommendations
With their No. 1 pick,
Philadelphia will probably go for
the elusive "Big Man." Everyone
points to Brad Daugherty. I ask
why?
Daugherty, a center at North
Carolina, had a solid, though un
spectacular season. His defense is
suspect, and he has questionable
inside strength. Philly will prob
ably draft him anyway, a mistake
that they will eventually realize.
Boston, on the other hand, will
do no wrong with Bias. A scorer
and a rebounder in college, Bias
will give the Celtics that definitive
small forward that can get up and
down the floor.
Then there's Golden State. Fi
nally, after suffering the injustice
of last year's draft, the Warriors
should find a blue chipper with
their third pick. That man should
be Auburn's Chuck Person.
