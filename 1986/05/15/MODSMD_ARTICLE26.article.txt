# Collier joins Cardinal staff
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
Stanford lost a Pearl of an assistant basketball
coach when Tom Davis left for lowa and took
most of his staff with him, but new mentor Mike
Montgomery may have plucked a diamond in
the rough off Don Monson's staff at Oregon in
luring Barry Collier to the Farm.
Collier is expected to fulfill many of the
duties Bruce Pearl had as Davis' right-hand
man and will be involved in recruiting, scouting
and working with the players.
"I've known Barry for a long time, and we've
gotten to be pretty good friends over the years,"
Montgomery said of the first assistant named to
his Stanford staff. "He's going to be heavily in
volved with recruiting. (But) when the season
comes around, our basketball team and players
take No. 1 priority."
After spending the last 10 years as an assis
tant, Collier is looking to eventually enter the
head coaching ranks.
"I feel like the move to Stanford in the long
run will help me be a better candidate for a head
coaching position," said Collier, who spent the

last three seasons with Monson in Oregon. "1
just think the (Stanford) program is highly
visible. We have a great reputation here that
touches everything including Stanford basket
ball."
The presence of Montgomery also played a
role in Collier's decision to leave Oregon and
the highly-regarded Monson.
"My relationship with Mike got me interested
in working here in the first place," the 31-year
old graduate of Butler said. "The chance to
work with Mike Montgomery, who is in my
opinion one of the best basketball coaches in
the country, is a great honor."
Montgomery and Collier have a "tremendous
amount of work" now according to Collier as
they try to get a handle on recruiting, hire the
rest of the staff and prepare for next season.
Montgomery, however, said he expects to
name his second full-time assistant soon while
waiting to tab a part-time coach.
Collier also has the added task of selling his
house in Eugene and moving his wife and two
young sons south.
"I'm hoping that by August we'll be able to
get them down there," he said.
