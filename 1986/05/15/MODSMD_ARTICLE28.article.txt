U.S. Navy intercepts Iranian ship
WASHINGTON — A U.S. Navy warship intercepted an Iranian
frigate earlier this week and convinced it to cease apparent efforts to in
terrupt a U.S. cargo ship's passage in the Gulf of Oman, the Pentagon
said yesterday.
"Late Monday night Washington time (10:50 p.m. EDT), the Ameri
can merchant ship SS President McKinley, while transiting in interna
tional waters, was hailed by radio by an Iranian frigate on patrol in the
Gulf of Oman," the Pentagon said in a prepared statement.
"A U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS David R. Ray, which was operating
in the area, was within a mile of the President McKinley when the
Iranian ship came into view.
"The U.S. destroyer identified itself to the Iranian frigate and re
quested the Iranians to stand clear to ensure freedom of navigation of
the U.S. merchant ship. The Iranian unit honored the U.S. unit's re
quest."
The Pentagon declined to provide additional details. But Administra
tion officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified, said
the Iranians were thought to have been planning to board the SS Presi
dent McKinley to search it for war material that might be bound for Iraq.
Iran, which has been fighting Iraq for more than five years, stopped
and searched the SS President Taylor last January in the Gulf of Oman.
During that incident, no U.S. Navy ships were close enough to intercede.
Soviets expel U.S. diplomat
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union announced yesterday that it had ex
pelled a U.S. diplomat for allegedly hatching a spy plot with a ClA
recruited Soviet citizen. It was the second expulsion of an American
diplomat in two months.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Jaroslav Verner said the diplomat, Erik
Sites, left the Soviet Union on Saturday. He said Sites was a member of
the staff of the U.S. military attache.
Following normal embassy policy, Verner refused to comment on the
Soviet charges, made in a dispatch from the official Tass news agency.
Tass, citing the KGB secret police, said Sites was "arrested in Moscow
on May 7, when he had a secret meeting with a Soviet citizen recruited
by the U.S. intelligence service.
"A big espionage action of U.S. secret services against the Soviet Un
ion was thwarted," the English-language dispatch said. The wording was
virtually identical to that of the March 14 announcement that U.S. Em
bassy Second Secretary Michael Sellers was being expelled.
Tass claimed evidence "obtained at the moment of arrest . . . and in
the course of the investigation fully disclose his (Sites') intelligence ac
tivities, incompatible with his official status."
It said Sites was declared persona non grata and that an investigation
was underway "in the case of the agent of the American intelligence ser
vice," an apparent reference to the Soviet citizen, who was not named.
Verner said he did not know if Sites was a member of the military, and
refused to say how long he had been in Moscow.
Blacks, police clash in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Thousands of black villagers
fought running battles with South African police and troops yesterday to
protest government plans to declare their tribal homeland
"independent" and no longer part of South Africa.
At least two people were reported killed and scores injured as security
forces fired buckshot, rubber bullets and tear-gas grenades to disperse a
rally of 25,000 villagers.
All live in Kwandebele, the tribal homeland that the government
wants to declare independent in December.
Angry youths counterattacked against the police and soldiers with
stones and firebombs, according to witnesses, and began burning the
stores and homes of Kwandebele officials. The officials were told to seek
refuge with their families at the nearest police station or army encamp
ment.
At nightfall, members of a pro-government black vigilante group
known as the Imbokhotho firebombed the homes of local activists in
retaliation.
By then, Kwandebele, an impoverished rural area of about 25 villages
80 miles northeast of Pretoria, the capital, had been surrounded by
heavily armed police officers and troops. The authorities hoped to con
tain the mounting violence until the arrival of reinforcements that would
enable them to occupy all the villages in the region.
Prince James Mahlangu, head of the local Ndzunda Madhoka Tribal
Authority, said by telephone that "we the chiefs and our people are in
revolt against this attempt to force us into so-called independence, and
the government should understand that we will fight rather than sub
mit."
According to Mahlangu, most of Kwandebele's 180,000 people,
nearly half of whom are not Ndebeles but members of other tribal
groups, oppose the independence move, "because it is phony and be
cause we will lose what little freedom we have when (Chief Minister
Simon) Skosana becomes president."
Artukovic sentenced to death
ZAGREB, Yugoslavia — A tribunal of five judges yesterday con
victed Andrija Artukovic, who fought extradition from the United
States for 36 years, of ordering the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of
people during World War 11.
The 86-year-old former interior minister of the Nazi puppet state of
Croatia was sentenced to death by firing squad.
Lawyers for Artukovic, called the "Butcher of the Balkans," an
nounced they would appeal.
Artukovic, seated in a three-sided enclosure of bullet-proof glass, lis
tened impassively as the sentence was pronounced and appeared to doze
through part of Chief Judge Milko Gajski's closing comments.
Artukovic "was the master of life and death . . . founder and inspiring
spirit of Nazi fascist Croatia," Gajski said in a 30-minute summation of
his verdict and the sentence.
Gajski said Artukovic, who was interior minister and security chief of
Croatia during part of World War 11, was guilty on all four counts of
mass slaughter specified in the indictment. Croatia was incorporated into
Yugoslavia after the war.
"This trial, which was pending for such a long time, is the victory of
justice," Gajski said.
In Washington, Neal Sher, head of the Justice Department's office of
special investigations, said: "The findings there as to his guilt really con
firm the findings that have been made in our courts; that is to say he was
engaged in terrible atrocities. Justice is served by his having been con
victed."
Israelis deny intent to attack Syria
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Shimon Peres yesterday forcefully
denied that Israel has any intention of attacking Syria, but he warned
that Syria is at a crossroads in its support of international terrorism and
should be cautious because of changing world attitudes toward terrorist
activity.
Speaking on Israeli radio on the country's's 38th anniversary of inde
pendence, Peres also reiterated that he sees no signs Syria is preparing to
attack Israel, at least in the near future.
Although Israeli officials confirmed that Peres had asked the United
States to convey Israel's concern to Syrian President Hafez Assad over
the new fortifications, informed sources said that the concern has been
tempered by the fact that no Syrian combat troops or weapons have
been moved into the fortifications, and that the sites could be merely
standby positions to which troops would be moved if necessary.
