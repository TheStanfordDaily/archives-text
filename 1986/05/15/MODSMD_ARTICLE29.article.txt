# Gorbachev speaks on disaster
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
in his first public statement on the accident at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant, disclosed last night
that nine persons have died — seven of them in
hospitals after the accident — and that 299 victims
are now hospitalized.
The number of those in hospitals represents a
sharp increase from the 204 persons reported as
hospitalized only five days ago.
In a somber speech on national television, Gor
bachev called the April 26 accident a painful
"misfortune" that has been used in the West to
mount "an unrestrained anti-Soviet campaign."
Gorbachev also used the occasion to extend a
unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing until Aug.
6, the anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of
Hiroshima, and to renew his offer to meet Presi
dent Reagan — in either Europe or Hiroshima —
for a start on test ban negotiations.
The Soviets unilaterally stopped testing last Aug.
6. The moratorium, due to end Jan. 1, was ex
tended by Gorbachev until March 31, and again
until the next test conducted by the United States,
which took place last month.
Most of Gorbachev's 26-minute speech was
devoted to the Chernobyl disaster, which he said
had revealed to the world for the first time "the
sinister force" of "nuclear energy that has escaped
control."
He described the cause of the accident as an un
explained surge that set off a hydrogen explosion
while the reactor was being shut down for sched
uled maintenance.
On April 29, the Soviets announced that two
persons had died in the accident. On May 12, they

said six had died of radiation and burns, but did not
say whether the six were in addition to the two.
For the most part, Gorbachev stressed, the dan
ger is over. "TTianks to the effective measures
taken, it is possible to say today that the worst has
passed. The most serious consequences have been
averted," he said.
"Of course, the end is not here yet. It is not the
time to rest," he added, noting that radiation in the
vicinty of the power station, 80 miles north of Kiev,
the capital of the Ukraine, "still remains dangerous
to human health."
Such a speech about a national disaster is consid
ered unusual for a Soviet leader and in keeping
with Gorbachev's campaign to shed some of the
secrecy traditional to Soviet life.
Western diplomats last night said its timing
seemed to coincide with what one called a "public
wind-down" of the incident.
Although Gorbachev's decision to address the
nation was seen here as politically novel, even bold,
some western diplomats expressed disappointment
that he chose to attack the West's reaction to the
crisis at Chernobyl.
"There was no suggestion that there had been
any problems anywhere else in Europe," noted one
western diplomat. "I had hoped he would have put
things more on an even keel."
Some Western European governments have
criticized the Soviet Union for not announcing the
accident for 2 1-2 days — until after radioactive
fallout was detected in Scandinavia — and for
releasing few details in the first week.
More information has been made available over
the last 10 days, as foreign and Soviet observers
have gone to the site and reported back.

Gorbachev defended the Soviet handling ot the
accident, sharply denying charges that timely infor
mation had not been distributed to other countries.
He said the charge was "invented, and claimed
that the United States had taken months to inform
the world about the nuclear accident at I hree Mile
Island, in Pennsylvania, in 1979.
But his harshest attack was for the reporting of
the events at Chernobyl by "the mass media in cer
tain NATO countries, especially the U.5.A.,"
which he described "generally speaking, as "a
veritable mountain of lies — most dishonest and
malicious lies."
Repeating themes that have been dominant
recently in the Soviet press, Gorbachev said the ex
aggerations in the western press about death tolls,
damages and panic among the population, were the
work of "certain western politicians" seeking to
"sow new seeds of mistrust and suspicion toward
socialist countries."
Gorbachev thanked foreign governments and in
dividuals for offers of help, specifically mentioning
the work of American doctors who have been as
sisting with treatment of radiation patients.
But he singled out the United States and West
Germany as places where the accident had been
manipulated for political ends, to divert attention
from recent Soviet arms control initiatives.
Referring to the recent summit of industrialized
nations in Tokyo, he said, "One involuntarily gets
the impression that the leaders of the capitalist
powers who gathered in Tokyo wanted to use
Chernobyl as a pretext for distracting the attention
of the world public from all those problems that
make them uncomfortable."
