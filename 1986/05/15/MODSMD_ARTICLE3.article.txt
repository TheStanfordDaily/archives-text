### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Stating that Israeli control of the
West Bank and Gaza "is not just a
debate about security," an Israeli
scholar said here last night that the
territorial question is a legitimate
debate within Zionism about the na
ture of Israel.
Shlomo Avineri, a political science
professor at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, told about 65 people at
Kresge Auditorium that two funda
mental approaches to the territorial
question are now debated in Israel's
National Unity Government.
The "territorial school." according
to Avineri, strives for Jewish control
over as much land as possible
"limited to the historical land of Is
rael." Under such a system, the Is
raeli government would maintain
control of Judea and Samaria, the
biblical names foi the West Bank ter
ritory, he said.
The territorial approach is backed
by the I ikud Party, one of two groups
forming the Israeli government.
The presence of 1.2 million non-
Jewish people in that area, however,
"poses some very profound prob
lems" for the territorial approach, he
s:iid.
The population split in such a situa
tion is 60 percent Jewish and 40 per
cent Arab, Avineri said.

"Sooner or later Israel will have to
entertain full political and civil
rights" to the Arab population, he
said, noting that Arabs would eventu
ally control 40 percent of the seats in
the government.
The opposition view, that of the
Labor Party, is a sociological ap
proach to territorial control, Avineri
said.
Under such an approach, "people
and demographics will determine the
area in which Israel will exist," he
said.
While the sociological approach
would reduce the amount of territory
under Israeli control, the population
of such an area would be approxi
mately 80 percent Jewish, he said.
Avineri praised Israel's National
Unity Government, established after
the country's 1984 elections, for
bringing increased civility into the
territorial debate.
"They have to address each other
in more polite terms," he said, adding
that "the debate is a little more civil
than it was a few years ago."
The outcome of the debate will
have long-term effects on the future
of Israel, Avineri said.
Avineri also praised the govern
ment for stabilizing the short-term
economic situation of Israel and for
pulling the country out of Lebanon
without a major national crisis.
