# House expected to pass budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House is
expected to approve a fiscal 1987
budget package today that President
Reagan has insisted is "totally unac
ceptable," because it would slash
defense spending and raise taxes $7.3
billion above the level the president
has said he will accept.
The House will consider several
budget alternatives, including one
sponsored by the Republican
majority, but those options are not
believed to have a significant chance
of prevailing against the proposal
passed last week on a party-line vote
by the Democratic-controlled House
Budget Committee.

Nonetheless, because the commit
tee budget plan faces potential oppo
sition from both ends of the political
spectrum, "I think it will be close,"
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill
Jr. (D-Mass.) said as debate on the
budget began yesterday.
Republicans and some conserva
tive Democrats object to the tax in
crease and defense cuts in the plan,
but even the GOP alternative would
leave military spending below the
level approved several weeks ago by
the Republican-led Senate. The GOP
package would authorize $293 billion
in new defense spending next year,
which is between the levels proposed

by the Budget Committee and ap
proved by the Senate.
By comparison, Reagan asked for
$320 billion.
The Senate's budget, passed over
Reagan's objections with votes from
a majority of each party, proposes as
much in new taxes as the House com
mittee plan.
Rep. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
House's second-ranking Republican,
said the Democrats' "liberal left
wing" — seeking higher taxes but
afraid of political criticism — decided
to "take that amount and hide behind

the Senate's bipartisan skirts."
On the other side, some liberals
have complained about the reduc
tions the committee budget would
make in a wide range of domestic
programs, in part by cutting 2.5 per
cent from the budgets of most pro
grams where spending is within
Congress' control. House Budget
Committee Chairman William Gray
111 (D-Pa.) asked those critics to
"look at the forest, not just one tree
that grows in their garden .... All of
us will suffer."
"It is the best medicine for an
America that is getting terribly sick of
red ink," he added.
