U.S. warns Syria, Israel
WASHINGTON — The United States has
cautioned Syria and Israel against going to war
again despite the "highly tense situation" along
their mutual border, Secretary of State George
Shultz said yesterday.
He said in response to questions about border
activity that "there is a big Syrian buildup" of
military forces and noted that Syrian fortifica
tions have been moved forward in Lebanon. His
was the first official confirmation of Israeli claims
that Syria is building artillery tnd tank trenches
in southern Lebanon.
"We don't believe a war between Syria and Is
rael would serve either party's interests, and we
have cautioned against it," Shultz told an Over
seas Writers Club luncheon. "It is a highly tense
situation, there's no doubt about it."
However, Shultz and White House spokesman
Larry Speakes appeared to be softening recent
Administration statements on possible Syrian in
volvement with terrorism, evidently to encourage
President Hafez Assad to use his influence
toward gaining the release of six hostages held in
Lebanon.
Shultz noted that Syria "has played a con
structive role in the past" to try gaining the
hostages' freedom and said further such help
would be "most welcome."

Speakes said Syria "continues to be helpful"
and "obviously has influence" in the hostage
matter. He added that there is no "conclusive
report of Syrian complicity" in the attempted
bombing of an Israeli jetliner in London last
month.
Privacy bill approved
WASHINGTON — A House panel approved
legislation yesterday to shield modern-day com
munications such as cellular phones and com
puter data files from electronic snoops, bestow
ing the kind of protection that long has been af
forded to first-class mail.
The proposal, which represents the first major
revision of privacy laws since 1968, would
preserve the ability of law enforcement authori
ties to gain access to these sources of communica
tions if the need for access can be demonstrated
to a court.
Rep. Robert Kastcnmeier (D-Wis.), who
heads a House justice subcommittee, told his col
leagues the existing law "from the standpoint of
technology, is wholly inadequate for contempo
rary cases."
The new language covers areas of eavesdrop
ping and electronic record-searching that have
not yet been perfected. It sets forth procedural

boundaries for federal access to private records,
including the availability of electronic carbon
copies of electronic mail and telephone messages
stored in computers.
Such communications would have the same
protection as first-class mail, and a prosecutor
would have to show probable cause to suspect
that a crime has been committed and to obtain a
court order to rummage through electronic files.
Owners of businesses which store computer
ized information about other people were
promised a clearer picture of what type of court
order is necessary to get access to their electronic
records.
Late rally boosts market
NEW YORK — A late rally hoisted the Dow
Jones industrial average back above the 1,800-
mark, but the broader market turned in a more
mediocre performance.
Wall Street's best-known indicator climbed
22.94 to 1,808.28, the biggest advance in the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials since a surge
of about 38 points on April 16.
However, in the overall tally on the New York
Stock Exchange, 769 issues declined in price, 763
increased while 447 were unchanged. The NYSE
composite index edged up 0.55 to 136.90.
