Drug testing demanded
LOS ANGELES — A county supervisor
demanded random drug tests for public transit
bus drivers yesterday after learning that a driver
blamed for a crash that injured 23 passengers had
cocaine in her blood.
The driver was suspended when traces of
cocaine were found in her blood after the down
town accident, and will be fired unless her union
can dissuade transit managers, said a spokesman
for the Southern California Rapid Transit Dis
trict.
At least one passenger said the driver. Vivian
Harris, 37, was speeding and weaving between
lanes before her bus smashed into the rear of an
other bus that was stopped at a traffic light at
9:45 a.m. Monday. Twenty-three passengers
from the two lightly loaded buses were taken to
hospitals for treatment of minor injuries, said
transit district spokesman Jim Smart.
"When she saw the bus, she didn't even try to
hit the brakes," said passenger Yesenia Nevarez,
20. "I felt like going to ask her if she was on
drugs."
Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth
Hahn said the transit district's policy of testing its
5,000 drivers before hiring and after major acci
dents doesn't go far enough to assure the public

safety.
"1 want a strong, no wishy-washy statement,
no pussyfooting: If you're going to work for the
RTD and move 1.5 million passengers around
the city, you're going to be a safe driver or you're
going to get another job," Hahn said at a news
conference.
Opponents of drug testing of employees,
however, have contended that it represents a bla
tant intrusion on constitutionally protected
rights, particularly those preventing arbitrary
search and seizure.
Amnesty show planned
SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco will be
the first stop on a six-city tour by Sting and other
rock stars that will benefit Amnesty Interna
tional. an organization devoted to freeing politi
cal prisoners and ending torture.
The concerts, called "A Conspiracy of Hope,"
were announced yesterday by Amnesty Interna
tional officials and spokesmen for promoter Bill
Graham, the San Francisco impresario who
produced last year's Live Aid concert in Philadel
phia.
After the June 4 concert in San Francisco, sub
sequent concerts will be in Los Angeles, Denver,

Atlanta and Chicago before the June 15 finale at
the Meadowlands in New Jersey. That concert,
biggest of the six, also will be carried live for
eight hours on the Music Television network,
Joan Baez, the folk singer and longtime sup
porter of Amnesty International, said at a news
conference here that the concerts are -the latest
expression of a new idealism that led to Live Aid,
the Farm Aid concert and other benefits.
"There is a mentality that is trying to rise up
from the ashes of the 1960s and the "705," Baez
said, adding that young people "are tired of being
called the Me Generation'. ... A human instinct
is saying that it's time to reach out."
Besides Sting and Baez, performers at the San
Francisco benefit at the Cow Palace will be Bryan
Adams, Jackson Browne, Peter Gabriel, the
Neville Brothers, Lou Reed and U2.
Sunny today, no spies
Both today and tomorrow will be sunny with
highs in the 70s. In a surprising move, Daily
Update editors announced that they would no
longer be running jokes in the weather section
unless they were at least marginally funny. The
decision was heralded as a major change in policy
for the paper.
