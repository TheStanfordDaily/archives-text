# Rosse: prof's charges false
## Stockdale's claim rejected 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
A fall class scheduled to be taught
by Hoover Senior Research Fellow
James Stockdale was not cancelled
due to his association with the conser
vative think tank, University Provost
James Rosse said in a report released
yesterday.
"There is no evidence, other than
his own deeply held belief, that Adm.
Stockdale's association with the
Hoover Institution had anything to
do with the (Philosophy) Depart
ment's decision" not to offer "Moral
Dilemmas in War and Peace," Rosse
said.
The 11-page report contained the
results of Rosse's investigation into
charges made by Stockdale in Sep
tember that the Philosophy Depart
ment had canceled a class he was
scheduled to co-teach because of his
connection to Hoover.
Despite Stockdale's conviction,
Rosse found that procedures used by
the Philosophy Department to decide
on Stockdale's class were not biased
and that Philosophy 76 was not of
fered due to "some deep misun
derstandings" between all those in
volved in the decision-making
process.
"Stockdale never received a clear
explanation of why the course was
not approved for offering in winter
(quarter) 1986," Rosse said, "and I
do not believe (Prof. Emeritus Philip)
Rhinelander fully understood what
happened either." Rhinelander and
Stockdale were scheduled to teach
the class together.
Stockdale was unavailable for com
ment yesterday, but Rhinelander said
he remains unsatisfied with the deci
sion about the course even after
hearing Rosse's conclusions.
Rhinelander said he was still un
clear as to why the course was can
celed. "It wasn't canceled on the basis
of any review of the course, because
none was done. And they (the de
partment) never gave a plausible rea
son for not reviewing it.
"My feeling is that there is plainly
prejudice of some kind at work

here," he said.
The Rosse report denied prejudice
was involved and instead cited cir
cumstance as a source of the
suspicions: "Lack of understanding
invited speculation. In the case of
Rhinelander, his speculation led to
conclusions about 'departmental
politics.' In the case of Stockdale and
in the presence of intense discussions
about relations between Hoover and
the rest of Stanford that took place
coincidentally in the spring and early
summer of 1985, his speculation led
to the conclusion that the cancellation
must have been caused by his associa
tion with Hoover.
"Both speculations appear to me to
have been wrong, but it is hard to
fault either in the circumstances in
which they were formed," Rosse
added.
"The (Philosophy) Department ap
pears to take its curricular respon
sibilities seriously and exercise these
responsibilities with care," Rosse said.
"At least one member of the de
partment did not even know the ad
miral had a Hoover appointment un
til after the news reports began to ap
pear. At no place in the record of the
department's deliberations did any
hint of irregular consideration oc
cur," Rosse said.
However, while the department's
procedure for review of courses to be
taught by non-faculty instructors was
"satisfactory," Rosse said its treat
ment of Stockdale was "unfair in cer
tain respects."
Neither was told of a change in the
department's procedure for review of
such courses, the provost said. "Nor
were they told of the department's
concern that Rhinelander's health
might put the course in Stockdale's
hands without there having been an
opportunity to review his credentials
for teaching the course."
But "it is also clear" that the de
partment faculty "were prepared to
set in motion their processes of syl
labus review and instructor accredita
tion if the (teachers) proposing the
course wished them to do so," Rosse
said.
