# Strokes of genius in commercial art
## Features 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
Fine art may take historical and
critical distinction over commer
cial art, but there is no arguing
which confronts the larger audi
ence. If this consideration of its
popularity arouses a lowbrow
image of commerical art, it is
something Terry Smith has had to
contend with for years. However,
upon surveying his paintings, the
misconception is easily dispelled.

Smith, a 1982 Stanford
graduate now preparing for his
second major local exhibit, does
not deny the pragmatic aspects of
his commercial art. Still, his
remains a highly personal pursuit.
His technique is airbursh, his
depictions remarkably lifelike, his
colors vibrant, but what distin
guishes him the most, aside from
enviable skills, are frequent excur
sions into fantasy, the surreal, the
symbolic, the unexpected. Within
that framework he chooses to
crystallize a natural simplicity but
never remotely approaches the
prosaic. There is always a hint of
the unusual or indescribable.
"People who see my work often
enough know there are twists to
it," Smith said.

Among those who have ap
parently found those twists ap
pealing are Adidas, Apple Com
puter, Pepsi, Budweiser, the Stan
ford Athletic Department and the
Stanford Medical Center â€” all of
whom have commissioned promo
tional artwork from Smith.
To date, he has assembled five
displays of his paintings, the first
of which introduced him at age 17
to a Los Angeles public. Newly
representing himself as JRS En
terprises (the name derives from
the initials of his late father), he
hosted his largest and most suc
cessful showing in his native city of
Huntington Beach last vear.
What Smith believes to be his
most consistent impulse as an art
ist is his fascination with individ
uals, particularly children, and
using the face to set a tone or proj
ect a quality. "You won't find any
landscapes, any bowls of fruit. I
like to do expressions. If people
aren't involved, I'll try to do it
with color," he said.
His tendency to emphasize
suspension, vastness of space and
his ability to capture the moment
is what comes to mind when
tracing the connections within his
body of work. Accomplishing
