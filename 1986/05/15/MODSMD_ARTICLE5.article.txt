# Strokes of genius in commercial art
## Features 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
Fine art may take historical and
critical distinction over commer
cial art, but there is no arguing
which confronts the larger audi
ence. If this consideration of its
popularity arouses a lowbrow
image of commerical art, it is
something Terry Smith has had to
contend with for years. However,
upon surveying his paintings, the
misconception is easily dispelled.

Feature

Smith, a 1982 Stanford
graduate now preparing for his
second major local exhibit, does
not deny the pragmatic aspects of
his commercial art. Still, his
remains a highly personal pursuit.
His technique is airbursh, his
depictions remarkably lifelike, his
colors vibrant, but what distin
guishes him the most, aside from
enviable skills, are frequent excur
sions into fantasy, the surreal, the
symbolic, the unexpected. Within
that framework he chooses to
crystallize a natural simplicity but
never remotely approaches the
prosaic. There is always a hint of
the unusual or indescribable.
"People who see my work often
enough know there are twists to
it," Smith said.

Among those who have ap
parently found those twists ap
pealing are Adidas, Apple Com
puter, Pepsi, Budweiser, the Stan
ford Athletic Department and the
Stanford Medical Center — all of
whom have commissioned promo
tional artwork from Smith.
To date, he has assembled five
displays of his paintings, the first
of which introduced him at age 17
to a Los Angeles public. Newly
representing himself as JRS En
terprises (the name derives from
the initials of his late father), he
hosted his largest and most suc
cessful showing in his native city of
Huntington Beach last vear.
What Smith believes to be his
most consistent impulse as an art
ist is his fascination with individ
uals, particularly children, and
using the face to set a tone or proj
ect a quality. "You won't find any
landscapes, any bowls of fruit. I
like to do expressions. If people
aren't involved, I'll try to do it
with color," he said.
His tendency to emphasize
suspension, vastness of space and
his ability to capture the moment
is what comes to mind when
tracing the connections within his
body of work. Accomplishing

these three elements are several of Smith's recurring
motifs which include azure blue sky backgrounds with
feathered clouds, objects bursting through other objects
in mythical creation and hovering butterflies as incidental
accompaniment to many of his subjects.
The tiger swallowtail butterfly is Smith's favorite motif
and appears with unabashed regularity in nearly every
piece he does. "It's a cycle symbol for me. It's a nice sym
bol for life, for freedom, for change. There will always be
a prettier butterfly. For most people, it's the color they
like. And it's light, very airy, very free," Smith said.
Claiming the tiger swallowtail as his trademark, he
points out the joy of repeating a peculiarity in one's art.
"One artist used to draw animals with pen and ink, black
on white, and he always put a red dot in there somewhere.
There was always a little red circle," he said.
More of his time and creativity are given over to con
cept than to actual painting, for in building concepts Smith
finds the greater challenge. He wishes, in turn, to pass the
challenge on to his audience, stirring it to respond and
question. He believes his technical abilities, sharpened
over the years in a progression from pencil drawing to
watercolor to pen and ink to acrylics to airbrush, should
not take credit for most of his success.
"I don't like to be classified as just an illustrator or as
just an artist. To me, one of the reasons my paintings work
is the concept," he said.
If it is unfamiliar to him, like the computer chip, Smith
will research a product for which he designs publicity, but
treating subjects on the athletic field is his second nature
and requires little homework. His life-long devotion to
athletics as a player, observer and theoretician gives him
an advantage, for he will not paint movement that appears
posed.
To capture the dynamics of an athletic event one must
understand it, preferably on several levels, and Smith's
background is a fund of such understanding. He worked
with the Stanford basketball team for four years, although
his own training regimen and playing career were
restricted by knee and back injuries.
To what extent ethnicity enters into his work depends
upon the public's interpretation of his pieces using black
subjects. Smith commented that, since ethnic groups are
underrepresented in commercial art, when he chooses to
portray blacks it might seem to make more of a statement
than he consciously intends. He would like to provide
more artwork devoted to ethnic subjects to fill the
growing need and demand, but stresses that it should
retain a universal appeal, that he never creates a painting

specifically for one group or race.
An ethnic message does, however, on occasion creep in.
A recent piece depicts two boys sitting back to back, both
with face resting in hand, both identical in all respects
from their clothing to their mischievous expressions, save
their hair and the color of their skin. Smith explained it is
his statement on South African apartheid yet does not in
sist that it be interpreted as such. If someone chooses to
view it in a playful sense, compositionally and themati
cally. Smith accepts that as valid. Regardless of the moti
vations behind a piece, he is content to have his public see
in it and take from it whatever it wishes.
His latest exhibit, which takes place this Saturday at St.
Francis High School in Mountain View from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., will include the 15 works Smith has completed for
Stanford in past years. Selected cards and limited-edition
prints will be available.

the affair, will be Smith's family. As last year, his grand
mother will probably be found proudly presiding over the
guestbook.
For his friends, it will be that rare vision of the
notoriously casual Smith at his most tailored. Although on
view himself, do not expect Smith to eagerly divulge his
paintings' themes or statements to the bemused and
curious.
"I don't like to be very obvious with a statement," he
said. "If people ask me, 'What does it mean?' very rarely
will I tell them."

For his friends, it will be that rare vision of the
notoriously casual Smith at his most tailored. Although on
view himself, do not expect Smith to eagerly divulge his
paintings' themes or statements to the bemused and
curious.
"I don't like to be very obvious with a statement," he
said. "If people ask me, 'What does it mean?' very rarely
will I tell them."

course guide.
Fine art may take historical and
critical distinction over commer
cial art, but there is no arguing
which confronts the larger audi
ence. If this consideration of its
popularity arouses a lowbrow
image of commerical art, it is
something Terry Smith has had to
contend with for years. However,
upon surveying his paintings, the
misconception is easily dispelled.

Feature

Smith, a 1982 Stanford
graduate now preparing for his
second major local exhibit, does
not deny the pragmatic aspects of
his commercial art. Still, his
remains a highly personal pursuit.
His technique is airbursh, his
depictions remarkably lifelike, his
colors vibrant, but what distin
guishes him the most, aside from
enviable skills, are frequent excur
sions into fantasy, the surreal, the
symbolic, the unexpected. Within
that framework he chooses to
crystallize a natural simplicity but
never remotely approaches the
prosaic. There is always a hint of
the unusual or indescribable.
"People who see my work often
enough know there are twists to
it," Smith said.

Among those who have ap
parently found those twists ap
pealing are Adidas, Apple Com
puter, Pepsi, Budweiser, the Stan
ford Athletic Department and the
Stanford Medical Center — all of
whom have commissioned promo
tional artwork from Smith.
To date, he has assembled five
displays of his paintings, the first
of which introduced him at age 17
to a Los Angeles public. Newly
representing himself as JRS En
terprises (the name derives from
the initials of his late father), he
hosted his largest and most suc
cessful showing in his native city of
Huntington Beach last vear.
What Smith believes to be his
most consistent impulse as an art
ist is his fascination with individ
uals, particularly children, and
using the face to set a tone or proj
ect a quality. "You won't find any
landscapes, any bowls of fruit. I
like to do expressions. If people
aren't involved, I'll try to do it
with color," he said.
His tendency to emphasize
suspension, vastness of space and
his ability to capture the moment
is what comes to mind when
tracing the connections within his
body of work. Accomplishing

these three elements are several of Smith's recurring
motifs which include azure blue sky backgrounds with
feathered clouds, objects bursting through other objects
in mythical creation and hovering butterflies as incidental
accompaniment to many of his subjects.
The tiger swallowtail butterfly is Smith's favorite motif
and appears with unabashed regularity in nearly every
piece he does. "It's a cycle symbol for me. It's a nice sym
bol for life, for freedom, for change. There will always be
a prettier butterfly. For most people, it's the color they
like. And it's light, very airy, very free," Smith said.
Claiming the tiger swallowtail as his trademark, he
points out the joy of repeating a peculiarity in one's art.
"One artist used to draw animals with pen and ink, black
on white, and he always put a red dot in there somewhere.
There was always a little red circle," he said.
More of his time and creativity are given over to con
cept than to actual painting, for in building concepts Smith
finds the greater challenge. He wishes, in turn, to pass the
challenge on to his audience, stirring it to respond and
question. He believes his technical abilities, sharpened
over the years in a progression from pencil drawing to
watercolor to pen and ink to acrylics to airbrush, should
not take credit for most of his success.
"I don't like to be classified as just an illustrator or as
just an artist. To me, one of the reasons my paintings work
is the concept," he said.
If it is unfamiliar to him, like the computer chip, Smith
will research a product for which he designs publicity, but
treating subjects on the athletic field is his second nature
and requires little homework. His life-long devotion to
athletics as a player, observer and theoretician gives him
an advantage, for he will not paint movement that appears
posed.
To capture the dynamics of an athletic event one must
understand it, preferably on several levels, and Smith's
background is a fund of such understanding. He worked
with the Stanford basketball team for four years, although
his own training regimen and playing career were
restricted by knee and back injuries.
To what extent ethnicity enters into his work depends
upon the public's interpretation of his pieces using black
subjects. Smith commented that, since ethnic groups are
underrepresented in commercial art, when he chooses to
portray blacks it might seem to make more of a statement
than he consciously intends. He would like to provide
more artwork devoted to ethnic subjects to fill the
growing need and demand, but stresses that it should
retain a universal appeal, that he never creates a painting

specifically for one group or race.
An ethnic message does, however, on occasion creep in.
A recent piece depicts two boys sitting back to back, both
with face resting in hand, both identical in all respects
from their clothing to their mischievous expressions, save
their hair and the color of their skin. Smith explained it is
his statement on South African apartheid yet does not in
sist that it be interpreted as such. If someone chooses to
view it in a playful sense, compositionally and themati
cally. Smith accepts that as valid. Regardless of the moti
vations behind a piece, he is content to have his public see
in it and take from it whatever it wishes.
His latest exhibit, which takes place this Saturday at St.
Francis High School in Mountain View from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., will include the 15 works Smith has completed for
Stanford in past years. Selected cards and limited-edition
prints will be available.
