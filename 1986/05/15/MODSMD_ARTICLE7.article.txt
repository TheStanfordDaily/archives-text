# Rally celebrates Israeli freedom

### CHRISTOPHER DOYLE 
The deputy speaker of the Israeli
Knesset addressed a White Plaza
crowd of about 75 yesterday in com
memoration of the 38th anniversary
of Israel's independence.
Dan Tichon, a member of an Israeli
delegation visiting the United States
at the invitation of the State Depart
ment, said that the current coalition
government has attained its major
goals.
He expressed optimism about the
country's economic and international
political prospects.
Tichon said that, in addition to Is
rael's withdrawal from Lebanon, the
country's economy is stronger, with
inflation down from 27 percent per
month to 1.5 percent.
He also gave a brief analysis of ten
sions between Israel and Syria. Al
though there is possibility of a war
with Syria in the Golan Heights, he
said, Israel would not start it. Israel
would, however, defend itself if at
tacked, he added.
Speaking on other neighbors of Is
rael, Tichon said Saudi Arabia has a

great deal of money and weapons and
is helping terrorism by giving money
to the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and Syria. He also said he did not
think the situation between Israel and
Jordan will improve soon.
"Hopefully Jordan's King Hussein
will come and talk in Jerusalem. But
King Hussein is not Sadat. He will not
come and negotiate," Tichon said.
Two sides are needed to solve prob
lems, he said, but only Israel, and not
the Arab world, is willing to
negotiate.
Tichon touched on the "Cold
Peace" between Israel and Egypt,
commenting on the fact that there is a
desert between the two nations that is
empty of troops.
"For the time being we will stay in
Judea and Sumaria," Tichon said.
"We will not endanger the existence
of the state of Israel."
Tichon acknowledged the in
creased threat of terrorism for
tourists, but stressed the importance
of tourism to Israel.
"I hope you will come to Israel and
help us with our problems," he said.
Tichon said that to maintain a

strong economy Israel must increase
exports and decrease imports. When
asked what he thought the United
States would do to maintain peace in

the Middle East, Tichon answered
that the United States has problems
in Nicaragua and in Lybia, and is not
ready to go and solve problems in Is

rael.
After the speech, people joined in
Israeli dances led by Stanford Hillel,
which organized the rally.
