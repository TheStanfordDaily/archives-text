A Daily article yesterday mis
represented the views of Paula
Groves, student representative to the
Board of Trustees' Special Commit
tee on Investments.
Groves said she felt the trustees
had been receptive to a student
presentation on divestment, but did
not say they had been receptive to the
demands of Stanford Out of South
Africa.
Groves said last night that in
meetings with trustees she had argued
for total divestment.
The Daily also reported yesterday
that this weekend's Brazilian Car
nival will take place in Maples
Pavilion. In fact, it will take place at
the Bechtel International Center.
The Daily regrets the errors.
