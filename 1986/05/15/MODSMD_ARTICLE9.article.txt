# Soviet defector speaks about his escape from secret police

He saw his chance to escape while visiting Sweden with
a tightly monitored group of about 15 colleagues.
'It was the last day that we were going to be there, and
we were all shopping in the American equivalent of K-
Mart. Our group had split into smaller groups, and since I
had some knowledge of Swedish, I was passing back and
forth between groups to offer my assistance. I made the
most of my opportunity and slipped out of the store. I
started jogging once I got onto the street, but I looked a
little out of place as everyone else was walking. Luckily, a
cab passed by, and I spent the last of my money getting
over to a Swedish police station."
This is the story told by Soviet defector Vladislav Kras
nov, who spoke last night at Roble Hall on his book,
"Soviet Defectors: The KGB Wanted List."
Krasnov, a former employee of Radio Moscow,
defected to Sweden in 1962 and is now associate professor
of Russian Studies at the Monterey Institute of Interna
tional Studies. He has been living in the United States
since 1965.
Krasnov based his book on the KGB Wanted List, a
confidential document compiled by the Soviet secret
police.
"During the post-war period 1945-69, the KGB
Wanted List described the brief histories of the 475 or so
people who have defected," Krasnov said. "This descrip

tion includes their physical descriptions, where they live
now (and) what they have been doing since their defec
tion. In all, it's about a 250-word file covering about half a
page."
Krasnov added that more people tried to escape in the
1945-69 period, but that they had either died doing so,
been denied asylum or returned to the Soviet Union. In
all, Krasnov estimates that 10,000 Soviet citizens have at
tempted to defect from the country during this period.
But Krasnov was lucky. Only a few manage to escape.
"Every year 50 people cross the border into Finland," he
said. "Only three or four succeed."
But defections are not news anymore, Krasnov said.
"People take (it) for granted now that people want to flee
from the USSR."
In spite of the fact that Soviet defections aren't as
newsworthy as they used to be, Krasnov strongly advo
cates defectors-to-be to obtain as much publicity as they
possibly can for their own benefit and protection.
"I didn't want publicity when I defected," Krasnov said.
"When a member of the Swedish government asked me if
I wanted to make a big deal about my defection, I said no.
I just wanted the chance to get myself together without all
the hoopla surrounding defectors."
"I now realize that that was a crucial mistake, The more
publicity you can get, (as a defector) the better. Luckily
for me, the Royal Swedish Commission decided in my fa
vor and granted me asylum. Otherwise I could have been
sent back to Russia and been anonymously dealt with."
