# SLAC adds PEP beamline

### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
Stanford will continue its trek into high tech with a
brand new addition to the Stanford Linear Accelerator
, Center (SLAC): a 51.2 million beamline facility at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL).
The facility, approved Tuesday by the Stanford
, Board of Trustees, will be funded by the Department
. Energy. It is designed to yield major increases in the
photon flux and spectral brilliance available at SSRL.
The beamline will be the first connected to the already
existing Positron-Electron-Project (PEP) storage ring
. at SLAC.
In the last 10 years, SSRL has contributed to major
advances in material science, condense matter physics,

chemistry and the biological sciences.
The 48 x 68-foot steel structure will result in X-ray
spectral brilliances far beyond those achieved or pro
posed anywhere else in the world. Construction is ex
pected to start this summer and take six to nine months
to complete.
According to Arthur Bienenstock, director of SSRL,
the beamline will be used primarily for academic proj;
ecis in addition to industrial and government labels.
"(The beamline) will allow people a second facility
of this type (at Stanford)," said Bienenstock. "We've
performed two-and-pne-half weeks of experiments on
the first one and we anticipate many people will want
to build a beamline."
Bienenstock added that the University may con
struct a third and fourth facility in the future.
