# Adelman talks on arms race
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
President Reagan's chief arms con
trol adviser, Ambassador Kenneth
Adelman, drew criticism last night
from Lawrence Livermore Labora
tory researcher Hugh DeWitt, who
had a "a profound and fundamental
disagreement with almost every
thing'' Adelman said at a panel dis
cussion on nuclear testing.
Joining Adelman and DeWitt on
the panel before approximately 50
people at Annenberg Auditorium
was Gloria Duffy, a member of the
Center for International Security and
Arms Control. David Holloway, a
senior research associate at the cen
ter, moderated the discussion.
In their opening remarks, the panel
members each focused on different
arms control topics. Adelman, who is
also director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, cited a suc
cessful trend in arms control that is
making a safer and more stable
world; DeWitt endorsed a compre
hensive nuclear weapons test ban;
and Duffy criticized the Administra
tion's stance regarding Soviet compli
ance of arms control treaties.
Adelman described arms control as
an exercise to tailor the forces of the
United States and the Soviet Union
to achieve greater stability and

reduce the number of weapons.
Adelman stressed that this defini
tion of has been distorted so much
that arms control is often perceived as
a "paper chase" for treaties. The suc
cess and implementation of arms con
trol treaties is what is important, not
the signing of them, he said.
Adelman said the arms control
process is succeeding for several
reasons:
• The trend in weapons is moving
toward smaller, more survivable
weapons that are safer and more
stabilizing.
• Research on the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI) offers stability and
greater protection against an acciden
tal launch or first strike.
DeWitt attacked Adelman's claims
of success in arms control, saying the
chances of a nuclear war would not be
reduced until a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) is ratified.
DeWitt then addressed three argu
ments against a CTBT — unreliable
verification, a need to test the
reliability of the U.S. nuclear
stockpile and the need to continue
testing in order to develop new, im
proved weapons.
Seismographic evidence is accurate
enough to verify that the Soviet Un
ion is complying with a CTBT,
DeWitt said. "There is no real
verification problem. It is a political

problem," he said.
The problem of maintaining a
reliable stockpile could be solved by
replacing older weapons with newly
constructed weapons made from the
same models, he said.
DeWitt cited what he described as
a "major scandal," in which weapons
labs have dictated defense policy. Be
cause they have designed weapons at
the upper limit of specifications, the
labs have forced the government into
a policy of using nuclear testing to
assure the reliability of its stockpile,
he said.
But Adelman disagreed with
DeWitt's conclusions, saying a CTBT
would not further the cause of arms
control because it would neither
reduce the number of weapons nor
increase stability.
Adelman also disagreed with
Duffy, who sharply criticized the
Reagan Administration's policy re
garding Soviet treaty compliance.
Instead of attempting to find a cre
ative solution to Soviet non
compliance, the Administration is
embarking on a policy of its own vio
lations, she said, referring to the pro
posed Midgetman missile and SDI.
Adelman, however, said it is
"nonsense" to equate SDI with a
violation of existing accords, includ
ing the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty and the unratified SALT 11.
