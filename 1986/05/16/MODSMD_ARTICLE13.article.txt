## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Dangerous precedent set 
### 
On May 5, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling
that was, in effect, a victory for those who advocate
capital punishment. In that far-reaching decision, our
nation's highest judicial body made a big mistake.
The ruling, which came in response to a constitu
tional challenge to the death penalty, granted that po
tential jurors who oppose capital punishment may be
excluded from trying cases where the defendant faces
death.
In so doing, the high court upheld the notion that
barring jurors who were against capital punishment
would not unfairly pit defendants in those trials against
"conviction-prone" juries.
As an issue in and of itself, capital punishment is
something that the United States does not need and
should abolish. From that viewpoint alone, the court's
latest decision is a poor one because it paves the way
for greater implementation of the death penalty in this
country.
Even more worrisome, however, are the dangerous
and wide-ranging ramifications of this precedent. If

anti-capital punishment views cannot be permitted in a
death penalty trial, then where does it end? Should a
minority be excluded from trying another person of the
same ethnic background because of possible sym
pathies? What about women on rape trials? Men on
rape trials?
The ruling could open a legal Pandora's Box.
In addition, keeping foes of the death penalty off of
a jury does more than eliminate any bias with regards
to capital punishment. The political and social beliefs
of an individual who is against capital punishment
probably parallel his views on a variety of other issues;
by eliminating people who likely hold similar view
points, you increase the chance of a biased jury.
The court's decision was not a unanimous one. The
three dissenting justices' argument was most strongly
summarized by Justice Thurgood Marshall: "Such a
blatant disregard for the rights of a capital defendant
offends logic, fairness and the Constitution."
Nothing could be more true.
