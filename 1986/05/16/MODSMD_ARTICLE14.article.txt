## Stanford's secret prize 
### 
More expensive than your Safeway variety perhaps (at
about $5,000 a quarter box), but a well-packaged treat.
Admittedly some of it is nutritionally lacking — those
hours by DeGuerre — but it is a happy snack, and we
know that the sugar coating is balanced off by the peanuts.
But when 1 eat Cracker Jacks I am always slightly aware
that I was promised something more. It is why I picked it
off the shelf rather than the potato chips or pretzels.
"Prize Inside," the box declares. And pretty soon the
rummaging starts, the fist wedged deep inside for that
edge of wax paper, that prize that separates mere eating
from this immaculate consumption.
At Stanford, the rummaging does not start for most un
til the upper class years, but a few lucky ones understand
early that the endless pages and papers should point to
something more. "Prize Inside" has been whispered to us
since our letter of acceptance lauded what we were, and as

new Stanford students, what we were about to become.
"Prize Inside" is hinted at in campus magazines and
speeches about this University. "Prize Inside," we are
constantly told, either overtly or with subtle insinuation,
and are thus invested with the assurance that we will come
out of here with more than just a strong literary or scien
tific education (which still equates us with those from
Harvard, Yale or other fine "academic" institutions), but
on a higher plane as somehow better, more decent, human
beings.
You see, the prize promised has always been that we
are at a fine academic institution that also sees education
on a broader, more humanistic level. Alumni who have
made significant contributions to society are heralded in
the Stanford Observer and the Stanford Magazine.
Awards and grants are given to students who "make a dif
ference" (are we tired of that phrase yet?). It is fair to
presume, then, that these people are seen as models of
Stanford's Joe-Student, and rightly so.
But this is a Cracker Jack box, remember? And true to
the Cracker Jack tradition, the prize I see now is, well,
chintzy. Because while the rhetoric and poesy of this uni
versity is sodden with proposed humanistic goals, there is
a huge inconsistency in many of its actions, and indeed, a
lot of its administrative make-up. We are less and less an
educational institution and more and more a business cor
poration, whose decisions are based on "fiduciary respon
sibility" (read "need and greed for big bucks"). One may
argue that this is only the practical aspect of a university
— hey, you say, we all need money. The problem — the

huge danger — is that it will sometimes trickle down into
the value system of the University — its very academic and
social structure — so that professors, student groups or
small student businesses that get in the way of this
"fiduciary responsibility," or somehow offend those who
are most responsible for the fiduciary-ness, are dis
couraged or — more harshly — quickly disposed of.
In short, you cannot insulate the going-ons on the
practical, monetary level from the University as a whole.
That myth led to Hoover Tower, the Reagan Library, a
very inconsistent tenure policy, no student coffee house, a
bizarre Western Culture indoctrination, and most
recently, a pathetic $9,900 divestment smokescreen.
My question is simple. How, in light of the fact that the
strongest influence on the University is colored not white,
black, Asian, male or female, but green, and the people
who hold that green are perhaps not, let us politely say,
education-oriented in every sense, are we supposed to
find that "prize" whfch, at about $16,000 a year, I think
we all deserve.
For that I need not only an administrative role model
that I can believe when it says,"I don't consider the finan
cial issues when making decisions about divestment"
(Donald Kennedy, Daily, May 13), but a system within
which I can learn what remains uninfluenced by its finan
cial considerations.
When we talk about the educational process, the means
are synonymous with the ends. As an educational and
humanistic institution, we must never defer to a profit
motive when it clashes with the values we supposedly
stand for. The current trend has been to stifle educational
situations (alternative classes such as the SWOPSI pro
gram, the student management of the Coffee House, pro
gressive professors) that are not aligned with the fiduciary
philosophy, because they might hurt "the future stu
dents." True, not ruffling the financial feathers might pro
vide these "future students" with pretty patios and up-to
date computers, but where does true education go in the
meantime? Are the "future students" that were consid
ered when divesting of a mere pittance of the $ 175 million
invested in South Africa really gaining by this clear incon
sistency with the educational purpose of Stanford.
I ask that the University sever its corporate mindset. It
must realign itself with its educational Grail. Just as im
portant, we must not get duped anymore by the Promise,
because unbiased academics will not be handed to us. It is
sad that it has become a scarce commodity, and sad, too,
that we must appeal with a high demand to get the supply
we long deserved. But the Cracker Jack prize remains, un
til we act, chintzy.
