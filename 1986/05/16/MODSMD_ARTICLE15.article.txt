Matherly misses
point of protests
Jason Matherly'scolumn, "Protests
Alienate Students" (Daily, May 12),
is a classic example of what might be
termed the negative Stanford
stereotype — a snobbish "in-group"
attitude reminiscent of country clubs.
Stanford students find the shanties,
placards and cheap voice amplifying
equipment "offensive." Of course,
the protesters are "arrogant," but
when has that not been true in the
eyes of a complacent person whose
eyes and ears are used to nothing
more than the ordered sensations of
the suburbia from which he/she
comes and whose continuance he/she
wishes?
At Stanford, protesters are usually,
by definition, a disenfranchised
minority of people. Therefore, it is
hardly surprising that they cannot
garner funds for elaborate equip
ment, placards and booths. I've seen
more general activism at Stanford for
far less universal issues than apart
heid or nuclear war — witness the
boycott of the Tresidder Union Cof
fee House some time ago.
I'm afraid that Mr. Matherly has
missed the more general truism that,
at Stanford, an activist posture, by
definition, puts you in conflict with
the vast majority of members of the
community. Study after study has
shown that students at far less com
placent campuses than Stanford are

currently more preoccupied with
future financial success than with is
sues which require a broader outlook.
Comedian Mort Sahl has said that the
current generation of students even
makes students of the 1950s look
ideologically "heroic" by compari
son.
Perhaps, on a sunny, peaceful day,
I, too, would be "inconvenienced" by
the noise — maybe I would even find
the protesters "arrogant" and/or dis
agree with their political stance. But
where I come from, we do not expect
the universe to revolve around our
wishes at all times. Campuses are
places for the ideology and energy of
youth to flourish — not places for the
spiritually exhausted to retire un
bothered.

Science not pure
It is truly a wonder how some
people make it all the way to
graduate school and still believe that
they can go through life without get
ting dirty. Apparently Richard
Huering, graduate student in the Bi
ology Department, believes this
myth. If you walk around in nature,
Richard, you're bound to get shit on
your shoes.
In his letter entitled "Science
confused with technology'* (Daily,
May 8), Huering attempted to ab

solve himself and the scientific com
munity from all human error and re
sponsibility. Instead, he put the
blame for all of humanity's ills
squarely on the shoulders of those
nasty engineers and their "runaway
technology."
Who is really confusing science and
technology and their relationship to
society? First of all, science owes
much to technology. In many in
stances, new technologies have made
scientific research possible. The tele
scope and the vacuum pump are only
two examples of technologies which
opened up new areas of study for sci
entists, allowing them to explore the
notions of gravity and the heliocentric
universe. Only quite recently, ap
proximately a century ago, has tech
nology become increasingly science
based. Science, by the way, is becom
ing ever more dependent upon tech
nology. Consider nearby SLAC as
only one example.
If we accept the claim that en
gineers are completely subject to the
"whims of market forces," may we
ask where money for scientific re
search comes from? Certainly it must
come from a completely objective
source whose interest it is to "unlock
the secrets of nature." Instead, we
suggest that politics and other outside
interests may be involved in the deci
sions concerning allocation of re
sources for research. In the biological
sciences in 1984, $1.5 billion was
used for research and development in
doctorate-granting institutions. Of

these dollars, less than one quarter
came from the universities them
selves. The remainder came from the
federal government, industry and
other non-profit organizations. While
graduate students of Mr. Heuring's
qualifications may have some choice
in their use of funding, most other
"pure scientists" employed in R & D
are not as fortunate.
Perhaps you're confusing life with
something else. Do you honestly
believe that the physicists who did re
search for the Manhattan Project are
any less culpable than the engineers
who designed the bomb? Come down
off of your pedestal and stop fooling
yourself. We are all a part of
humanity, we are collectively respon
sible (or should be) for our decisions
and our mistakes. The pious nonsense
about the purity of science is just that
— PIOUS NONSENSE.
