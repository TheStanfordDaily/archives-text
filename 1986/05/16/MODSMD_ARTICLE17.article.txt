# Bargain away Star Wars

It has been three years since President Reagan pro
posed to the nation's scientific community that they begin
working on a Strategic Defense Initiative that would make
nuclear weapons "impotent and obsolete." What are the
prospects of SDI now? What are some prominent issues in
the national debate?
The fundamental issues over which people argue the
most are: SDl's technological feasibility, its economic
feasibility and its implications for strategic stability. Can
we do it, can we afford it and will it make us any safer?
Technological feasibility. Gen. Abrahamson, direc
tor of the SDI office, is convinced that we can do it — no
problem. He enthusiastically hailed as a brilliant success a
test showing that a missile can shoot down a stationary ob-

ject in the atmosphere — never mind that the object was
not moving at thousands of miles per hour, did not have
hundreds of decoys around it to confuse targeting and did
not have protective hardening. These are all details to be
worked out iater.
112 CAnd yet it is not simply the peace groups that criticize
foils'kind of glossing over details; it is also many of the
pro-SDI scientists who are working on the program. A
report written by SDI researchers and recently circulated
to congressional subcommittees warned of serious prob
lems. Among them were: 1) No technique has been found
to harden space-based SDI components against missile at
tack, so the system will be extremely vulnerable to attack
from Soviet anti-satellite weapons. 2) No effective system
has been devised to discriminate between warheads and
decoys. 3) The success of strategic defense hinges on its
ability to kill nuclear missiles during the first phase of
flight, but the Soviets can severely complicate this strategy
by shortening this "boost phase" to less than a minute.
Economic feasibility. This is a hot topic, over which the
Departments of Defense and State are arguing bitterly
right now. Last year Paul Nitze, Reagan's special adviser
on arms control, became the voice of reason in the State
Department by outlining an important criterion for SDI:
it should be "cost effective on the margin," meaning that
whatever it costs the Soviets to build one more missile, it
should cost the United States less to shoot down that one
additional missile. The criterion was adopted as official
Administration policy, and fully endorsed by the State
Department. The Pentagon, however, has been trying to
weasel out of it by avoiding the term "cost effective" and
replacing it with the more open-ended one of
"affordable."
Who knows what "affordable" may mean, when the
Pentagon is unphased by estimates of $600 billion to
launch the system into orbit and $200 billion a year to
operate it? (The entire defense budget for fiscal year 1987

was $300 billion.)
Strategic stability. The question of security is the most
important one. Even if we can build it (or at least a partial
defense), and even if we can afford it (provided for by
more cutbacks in social programs), do we really want it?
One of the dangers of SDI is that it can be over
whelmed. The SDI scientists discussed this in their report
when they admitted: "Even if effective decoy detection
systems can be discovered, a Soviet 'threat cloud' of war
heads, decoys, orbiting pellets, space mines and penetra
tion aids — all filling the air at once during an attack —
may prove 10 times larger than SDI planners have previ
ously believed, therefore adding unforeseen difficulties to
the system's ability to shoot down incoming missiles."
A space-based defense would also be extremely vulner
able to attack, especially those components in low orbit
which are needed to shoot down missiles during the vital
first "boost phase."
And what of perceptions? Since strategic defense can
be attacked and overwhelmed, it offers negligable protec
tion to the population. But the really scary part is that it
may offer significant protection against a retaliatory strike.
So imagine a crisis — tensions are high and leaders begin
to feel that war is becoming inevitable, or else feel that the
leaders of the other country feel that war is inevitable. As
the strategic balance stands now, it would probably be
marginally better to strike first than to retaliate. But in the
age of strategic defense, it may appear to be much better
to strike first since you will lose so much by being struck,
but possibly "survive" a second strike with the aid of your
defense.

Why are we pursing this
pipe-dream?

Why are we pursing this pipe-dream? It will make us
less, not more secure. Curiously enough, Weinberger him
self pointed this out in a letter to Reagan that was leaked
to the press on the eve of the Summit. He said: "Even a
partial Soviet strategic defense will impair the effective
ness of the U.S. nuclear deterrent and call for U.S. coun
termeasures." Good thinking, Cap! Now just for kicks,
let's turn that statement around .... "Even a partial U.S.
strategic defense will impair the effectiveness of the Soviet
nuclear deterrent and call for Soviet counterme&sures."
What will this kind of thinking, on both sides, lead to?
The deployment of strategic defense components will
mean an offensive build-up, satellites designed to shoot
down defense satellites, more satellites designed to shoot
down the satellites designed to shoot down defense
satellites. .. . And of course arms control will have been
thrown out the window early in this scenario.
OK, it was fun for a while, guys, but it's time to bar
gain SDI away.
