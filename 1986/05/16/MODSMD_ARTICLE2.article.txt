# Vote to be held on ASSU funds
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
An ASSU special election will be
held Wednesday and Thursday to
resolve a two-year controversy con
cerning the ASSU's financial policy.
The proposed referendum would
fix the interest rates paid to student
groups with savings in the ASSU's
Student Organizations Fund at levels
comparable to those offered at
nearby banks and savings and loans
associations.
Proposed by Graduate Senator
Richard Biegel, the referendum
states that the Student Organizations
Fund will offer savings accounts,
money-market savings accounts and
one-year certificates of deposit to stu
dent groups that bank with the
ASSU.
"The interest rates offered on all
accounts shall be competitive with the
rates offered on similar accounts
available at nearby banks and savings
and loans associations. . .. Initially,
the interest rate on savings accounts
shall be five and one-half percent, the
interest rate on money-market ac
counts with a minimum balance of
$1,000 shall be six and one-half per
cent, and the interest rate on one
year fixed-rate certificates of deposit
shall be eight percent," the referen
dum states.
According to Senate Chair Carey
White, the ASSU now pays student
groups "a margin of interest points
less than the rate earned by the
ASSU when it invests those funds."
The ASSU uses the profits earned by
the banking service to pay expenses

incurred in running the government.
"Since we don't actually tax the
students to pay for the ASSU, we get
the money from interest on the stu
dent groups' funds," White said.
In a statement favoring the refer
endum, Biegel said, "the Senate is
considering reducing interest rates
(paid to student groups) to four per
cent," to counter the money that will
be lost in transferring funds to a
South Africa-free account. According
to Biegel, that rate "is unfair because
student organizations are not given
the option of putting their money in
another bank where anyone could get
a higher rate."
Last month, the ASSU voted to
divest its fund from the University
money pools, which are invested in
companies with business dealings
South Africa. ASSU Financial
Manager Duncan Weaver told The
Daily last night that the ASSU will
lose $21,000 annually due to
divestiture.
According to Weaver, the "interest
rates given to student groups
wouldn't necessarily be cut to 4
percent" as a result of divestment.
Weaver explained that the proposal is
to "set a floor" on the rate the ASSU
will pay to student funds, so organiza
tions will be assured of receiving no
less than 4 percent interest on their
money.
"Richard wants us to pay groups
exactly what we're earning," Weaver
said, arguing that the money the
ASSU makes on the margin is the
