## 'Bay to Breakers' boss brings in the big bucks 
### LISA HERSCHBACH Staff writer 
Traditionally, many college students spend
Sunday mornings sleeping off the effects of
Saturday nights.
This Sunday, however, will be a little dif
ferent.
At 8 a.m., hordes of Stanford students,
many in costume, will join a crowd of nearly
100,000 to run, walk or stumble up and
down the hills of San Francisco.
The occasion is the 75th running of the
San Francisco Examiner Bay to Breakers
footrace, the oldest and largest race of its
kind in the world.
Participants, ranging in age from nine
months to 90 years, often negotiate the 12-
kilometer course through the city in ham
burger costumes, tied together in groups or
in strollers or wheelchairs.
And the person responsible for the race's
international fame and incredible success as
a charity fund raiser is Terri Robbins, Stan
ford graduate and Examiner promotional
director since 1981.
Robbins, who has a special interest in edu
cational television, received her masters in
communication from Stanford in 1977. Prior
to working at the Examiner, her media ex
perience consisted of internships in
children's television programming, including
"Sesame Street."
Robbins admits she was unfamiliar with
newspaper work, and advertising and pro
motion in particular, but her inexperience
has been outweighed by a natural talent for
the work.
"I relied on my common sense," she says
of her first year at the Examiner. "And I
used the Bay to Breakers as an opportunity
to try out my promotion and marketing
ideas."
When she joined the Examiner staff, Rob
bins says,"The race was 70 years old, and
needed a good shake."
She shook up the race all right — like the
1906 earthquake shook up San Francisco.
"My goal was to merchandize the race,
and to make as much money as I could for
the Examiner's charities," she says.
As a result of Robbins' campaign to
decrease the number of unregistered runners
— "bandits" — the number of rsgistered
runners has more than tripled since 1981, to
over 85,000 last year.
This has meant increased funds for Ex
aminer Charities, Inc., the non-profit arm of
the San Francisco Examiner. Examiner
Charities, Inc. then donates the money to
dozens of Bay Area charities.
Some of the charities it benefits include
the Golden Gate Chapter of the American
Red Cross, the Guardsmen and the Califor
nia Conservation Corps. The race earned
$250,000 for charities in 1985, and or
ganizers expect to surpass that figure this
year.
Robbins' success in securing major spon
sors like BMW, Miller Highlife, Pan Am and
Pepsi has also increased the amount of
money the race brings to Examiner
Charities.
Sponsors provide about a quarter of all

funds raised, according to Robbins. Today,
sponsors are standing in line to become in
volved in the race.
In addition, by obtaining such media spon
sors for the race as KPIX-TV and KSFO
radio, Robbins has dramatically increased
the race's visibility and made the Bay to
Breakers one of the few media-sponsored
running events in the country.
And Robbins has also raised the status of
the race by recruiting world famous runners
such as Joan Benoit, Grete Waitz, Rod
Dixon and Frank Shorter.
"I want athletes who are fast," says Rob
bins, "but I also want them to be articulate.
They are a useful tool to speak to the press."
As promotional director, Robbins says her
No. 1 job "is to promote the Examiner."
This year, to try to make the race a stronger
marketing tool, Robbins attached a subscrip
tion form to the race entry. That promotion
resulted in "thousands of new subscriptions"
for the Examiner, according to Robbins.
"My No. 2 job is to make people think
when they write out their $9 entry fee,"
Robbins says."The whole reason the race
exists is to benefit charities."
This year marks the 75th anniversary of
the Bay to Breakers and the 20th anniver
sary of the San Francisco Examiner's spon
sorship of the race. The event has grown
from a mere 200 runners in 1966 to an ex
pected 100,000 runners this year.
The race is so large that the winners, who
run the distance in under 35 minutes, cross
the finish line before many runners have
crossed the starting line.
"This year will be the biggest Breakers
ever. And 31,000 of the registered runners
have never run any race before," Robbins
says.
"I'm looking forward to the day when I'll
have the time to run the race myself," says
Robbins. "It is a fun, exciting and very dif
ferent event."
Indeed, although the race offers such
prizes as a year's use of a 1986 BMW and a
pendant sculptured in gold and diamonds, it
is the novelty of the race that attracts most of
its participants.
"Last year I saw a man running naked, so I
had to go back to see what the sights would
be this year," says sophmore Don Geddis.
Sophomore Daniel Rowen agrees the race
is unique. "It's a once in a lifetime experi
ence," he says."I know it's going to be a
madhouse and I probably won't be able to
run or anything, but it should be a great
time."
" Really, the whole race is one big party —
it's not a race at all," Geddis says.
Indeed, San Francisco will be the site of
one colossal party this weekend. The Embar
cadero Center will host block parties today
from 5:15 to 9 p.m. and tomorrow from sto
10:30 p.m., featuring food, live entertain
ment and dancing. Center restaurants will set
up specialty food and beverage booths, and
Bay Area bands will perform outdoors.
After the race on Sunday, runners who
still have the energy can continue to revel in
the Golden Gate Park, where there will be a
post-race party. The festival will include an
awards ceremony and a picnic.
