# Death toll unknown in monkey breeder meltdown
## 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
NEWSFLASH! Palo Alto — A
freak accident yesterday resulted in
the loss of countless Sea-Monkey
lives here in spite of the efforts of
Mergatroid C. Monkey to right his
habitat with the frantic flagellations
of his cilia.
The contents of the Sea-Monkey
breeding reactor overflowed after the
habitat base became dislodged from
its unstable foundations, spilling the
special, purified solution into the aca
demic environment.
Onlooker Marilyn Wann was heard
to say, "Oh gosh," as the organisms
spread across the flecked beige
linoleum.
Residents exposed to the wildly
fertile juices have raised an unprece
dented clamor for contraceptive pills
at local drugstores, depleting supplies
at record rates, even though officials
warn that the side effects of such
overdosage could be worse than any
mildly increased tendencies to
procreate or to produce hybridized
brine shrimp eggs instead of normal
human fetuses.
Analysts admitted that the average
family in the spill area may have 2.4
instead of 2.3 children over the next
20 years, but they assured residents
that this fluctuation is statistically in
significant.
Monkey, Mergatroid C. — five days
old, former resident of Ocean Zoo
live pet container No. 650, dead of a
terminal spillage at 14:05:46, 15 May
1986, beloved member of his Sea-
Monkey colony, survived by his
loving legal guardian and Daily col
umnist Marilyn Wann. Donations to

the grieving family can be sent in her
name, care of that publication.
Monkey, Mildred C. — beloved wife
of the late Mergatroid, also dead of
the terminal spillage that struck
Ocean Zoo No. 650, devoted mother
of Mehitabel and Mephisto, the
oldest of their some 150 children who
also perished, unnamed, with them,
14:06:23, 15 May 1986. Once again,
donations can be sent to The Daily;
no check is too large or too small.

Monkey, Mehitabel C. and Mephisto
C. — freed from crystalline state of
suspended animation 10 May 1986 —
died 15 May 1986, loving children of
Mildred and Mergatroid, along with
their legion siblings. Donations,
donations, donations.
All right, so I'm overreacting; so I
got emotionally attached to some
little squirmy brown rejects from fifth
grade sex ed filmstrip stardom in a

plastic habitat complete with sim
ulated crater terrain and magnifying
"Micro-Vue" bubble siding; and then
I let them spill their guts out on
linoleum.
This is important stuff, though.
People sit in cages in White Plaza
over stuff like this.
And it's childhood, too. Don't you
believe in Peter Pan peanut butter,
Legos, Speed Racer and the Mach 5,
"Fred, get the super sauce, we're
gonna zoom zoom zoom-a-zoom,
we're the Buggaloos," Mr. Speedy
Delivery and Mr. Hooper, Mr.
Greenjeans and Mr. Potato Head,
Dr. Bunson Honeydew and his faith
ful lab assistant Beaker, at least the
Romper Room lady's mirror ?
Sea-Monkeys are easily as power
ful as all these icons, these universal
archetypes, leitmotifs of our early
lives.
And they certainly raise deeper
questions than sneezing powder and
black gag soap, the other options for
mail-order buyers in the backs of
comic books.
Questions like: What is the
Buddha-nature of the Sea-Monkey?
Do they cure the common cold?
When is the stuffy-head-runny-nose
season for Sea-Monkeys?
But first, you spend 24 hours
waiting for the contents of Packet No.
1, Water Purifier, to take effect.
Then, (and I got a big bang out of
this part) you pour Packet No. 2, In
stant Life, and stir for a minute.
Presto! Ragu! Voila! Eureka!
Hoover! If you look real close you
can see some dust jittering around
against the current.
Two days later, as I emptied one
level Feeding Spoonful of Packet No.
3's Growth Food into the water, my

little allergens or pollens or whatever
did the Sea-Monkey shuffle up to the
surface where they rebounded like
yo-yos, bumping not so much against
the food as against the surface tension
of the water.
Like the label promised, "Just add
WATER and FUN begins! They
swim, play, and GROW up to 3/4-
inch long, live up to A YEAR or
MORE, and even produce dozens of
adorable babies."
When a bio tart in my house heard
about them, she rushed us off to a lab
room drifting in toads doing the
formaldehyde freestyle and started

"I wanted to sell
life in a package
like a candy bar."
— Harold von
Braunhut

babbling about the different colored
lights she could micro-scam my Sea-
Monkeys with; we thought we'd iden
tified my micro-shrimp-cocktail as
class: branchiopoda, species:
metanauplius, whose family portrait
is shown at right.
I was relieved to find out later that
this scary cavity creep isn't really
related to Sea-Monkeys and wasn't
really swimming around in my room,
but whatever we fried over a micro
scope's lightbulb sure looked like this
cold prickly.
Worried about the menacing look

of my monkey and also unable to
believe the years of fun that were in
store for me, I called up Harold von
Braunhut, the inventor (really, the
guy has 160 patents, one of them for
Sea-Monkeys) of the only organism
specially bred for the eight-year-old
mentality, to get the triple scoop
banana split on these aquatic apes.
He divulged that Sea-Monkeys
come from artemia sal inn, or common
brine shrimp, which were paiastak
ingly guided through "thousands of
generations" of cross-breeding which
extended their lifespan months
beyond the usual 14 days and killed
their taste for salt water.
"I can't tell you how 1 did it, that
would be like giving out the formula
for Classic Coke," he crackled
through the phone lines all the way
from Transcience Labs, located
somewhere far, far away from this
laundromat.
"1 wanted to sell life in a package
like a candy bar," said the creator of
artemia nyos. "I wanted to find a way
to give children a respect for life,
curiosity in science and nature, to
make them into thinkers and not
hunters."
Certainly did that for me — yup —
respect and curiosity all over the
linoleum.
He estimated that developing Sea-
Monkeys nowadays — instead of in
1958 when he started the 12 years of
lab work that put dust in my purified
water — would cost $5 million.
You could harvest a lot of pet
rocks, twist a lot of Slinkys, or buy
one big pile of Alpo for that.
There's tough competition out
there, sure, but I think Sea-Monkeys
will survive and flourish in spite of my
lost colony.

All right, so I'm overreacting; so I
got emotionally attached to some
little squirmy brown rejects from fifth
grade sex ed filmstrip stardom in a

plastic habitat complete with sim
ulated crater terrain and magnifying
"Micro-Vue" bubble siding; and then
I let them spill their guts out on
linoleum.
This is important stuff, though.
People sit in cages in White Plaza

gonna zoom zoom zoom-a-zoom,
we're the Buggaloos," Mr. Speedy

Romper Room lady's mirror ?
Sea-Monkeys are easily as power
ful as all these icons, these universal
archetypes, leitmotifs of our early
lives.
And they certainly raise deeper
questions than sneezing powder and
black gag soap, the other options for
mail-order buyers in the backs of
comic books.
Questions like: What is the
Buddha-nature of the Sea-Monkey?
Do they cure the common cold?
When is the stuffy-head-runny-nose
season for Sea-Monkeys?
But first, you spend 24 hours
waiting for the contents of Packet No.

Then, (and I got a big bang out of
this part) you pour Packet No. 2, In

Presto! Ragu! Voila! Eureka!
Hoover! If you look real close you
can see some dust jittering around
against the current.
Two days later, as I emptied one

3's Growth Food into the water, my

little allergens or pollens or whatever
did the Sea-Monkey shuffle up to the
surface where they rebounded like
yo-yos, bumping not so much against
the food as against the surface tension
of the water.
Like the label promised, "Just add
WATER and FUN begins! They
swim, play, and GROW up to 3/4-
inch long, live up to A YEAR or
MORE, and even produce dozens of
adorable babies."
When a bio tart in my house heard
about them, she rushed us off to a lab
room drifting in toads doing the

"I wanted to sell
life in a package
like a candy bar."

Braunhut

babbling about the different colored
lights she could micro-scam my Sea-
Monkeys with; we thought we'd iden
tified my micro-shrimp-cocktail as
class: branchiopoda, species:
metanauplius, whose family portrait
is shown at right.
I was relieved to find out later that
this scary cavity creep isn't really
related to Sea-Monkeys and wasn't
really swimming around in my room,
but whatever we fried over a micro
scope's lightbulb sure looked like this
cold prickly.
Worried about the menacing look

of my monkey and also unable to
believe the years of fun that were in
store for me, I called up Harold von
Braunhut, the inventor (really, the
guy has 160 patents, one of them for
Sea-Monkeys) of the only organism
specially bred for the eight-year-old
mentality, to get the triple scoop
banana split on these aquatic apes.
He divulged that Sea-Monkeys
come from artemia sal inn, or common
brine shrimp, which were paiastak
ingly guided through "thousands of
generations" of cross-breeding which
extended their lifespan months
beyond the usual 14 days and killed
their taste for salt water.
"I can't tell you how 1 did it, that
would be like giving out the formula
for Classic Coke," he crackled
through the phone lines all the way
from Transcience Labs, located
somewhere far, far away from this
laundromat.
"1 wanted to sell life in a package
like a candy bar," said the creator of
artemia nyos. "I wanted to find a way
to give children a respect for life,
curiosity in science and nature, to
make them into thinkers and not
hunters."
Certainly did that for me — yup —
respect and curiosity all over the
linoleum.
He estimated that developing Sea-
Monkeys nowadays — instead of in
1958 when he started the 12 years of
lab work that put dust in my purified
water — would cost $5 million.
You could harvest a lot of pet
rocks, twist a lot of Slinkys, or buy
one big pile of Alpo for that.
There's tough competition out
there, sure, but I think Sea-Monkeys
will survive and flourish in spite of my
lost colony.

NEWSFLASH! Palo Alto — A
freak accident yesterday resulted in
the loss of countless Sea-Monkey
lives here in spite of the efforts of
Mergatroid C. Monkey to right his
habitat with the frantic flagellations
of his cilia.
The contents of the Sea-Monkey
breeding reactor overflowed after the
habitat base became dislodged from
its unstable foundations, spilling the
special, purified solution into the aca
demic environment.
Onlooker Marilyn Wann was heard
to say, "Oh gosh," as the organisms
spread across the flecked beige
linoleum.
Residents exposed to the wildly
fertile juices have raised an unprece
dented clamor for contraceptive pills
at local drugstores, depleting supplies
at record rates, even though officials
warn that the side effects of such
overdosage could be worse than any
mildly increased tendencies to
procreate or to produce hybridized
brine shrimp eggs instead of normal
human fetuses.
Analysts admitted that the average
family in the spill area may have 2.4
instead of 2.3 children over the next
20 years, but they assured residents
that this fluctuation is statistically in
significant.
Monkey, Mergatroid C. — five days
old, former resident of Ocean Zoo
live pet container No. 650, dead of a
terminal spillage at 14:05:46, 15 May
1986, beloved member of his Sea-
Monkey colony, survived by his
loving legal guardian and Daily col
umnist Marilyn Wann. Donations to

the grieving family can be sent in her
name, care of that publication.
Monkey, Mildred C. — beloved wife
of the late Mergatroid, also dead of
the terminal spillage that struck
Ocean Zoo No. 650, devoted mother
of Mehitabel and Mephisto, the
oldest of their some 150 children who
also perished, unnamed, with them,
14:06:23, 15 May 1986. Once again,
donations can be sent to The Daily;
no check is too large or too small.
