"It was the pickles that killed him. I
told him to switch to the half-sour,
but he wouldn't listen — he kept
eating the sour ones. It was the sour
ones that buried him," Samuel ex
claims about a former poker partner
who has just passed away.
His roommate Ernest slowly starts
to smile while Samuel tries not to
look at him and bites his lip. "Would
you quit it!" Bill, who plays Ernest,
exclaims, breaking into laughter that
is not in the script.
It's dress rehearsal of Douglas
Abrams' modern comedy "His
Own," to be performed as the
Trancos dorm play this weekend. The
actors are having some trouble con
trolling their laughter tonight, but
they expect to be drowned out by the
audience — and with good reason.
Abrams, a freshman in Trancos,
wrote "His Own" during 1984-85,
winning the New York City Young
Playwright's Festival in 1984.
Not all of Abram's experiences
with the theater have been quite so
glamorous.
"To date my acting career is about
seven lines long," Abrams says. After
starring as Man Four and Man Six in

"Annie Get Your Gun," he went on
to give a convincing, portrayal of
Guard Two in "The Wizard of Oz."
"Someone was telling me to give
up the theater altogether. Then I was
asked to join a playwriting workshop
and . . . that's when I started writing
scenes," Abrams remembers.
Abrams chose to set the play at
Thanksgiving time "because I believe
that it's a holiday in America that has
no biases. It's just American," he
says. The characters each comment
on what they think the meaning be
hind Thanksgiving is, each adding his
own touches of humor.
"This play is from an older point of
view," said Derek Bruton, who plays
Tom. "And Doug is a genius to write
it at such a young age."
Back at the dress rehearsal, the ac
tors are discussing their lines with
Vicky Hamilton, the director. Alicia
Stephens, who plays Brenda, the
"professional mother," walks over to
Doug. "What do you imagine Brenda
wearing?" she asks him, and the two
discuss her choice of clothes.
In the background, the sounds of a
piano and a saxophone can be heard.
Sophomore Tim a resi
dent of Soto, plays a few notes on the
piano while freshman David Park im
provises on the sax.

Westergren composed the original
score for "His Own" several weeks
ago. "I read the play, and wrote down
what I thought about the characters
... and composed accordingly," he
said.
"The music fits the characters,"
says Hamilton.
"When I first started acting in the
play I didn't understand it much,"
says Clicker, who plays Samuel. "But
every time I go through it I see more
in it. There is a lot of thought in this
play."
That thinking is evident in the ec
centric characters, who each have
their own little quirks and
philosophies that are as unpredictable
as they are funny. There is Tom,
working on a book titled "Mostly
Agony and Not Much Ecstasy" — an
autobiography. In Act II he has a
hilarious one-way discussion with the
audience on the merits of the bath
room.
"I can really get into that scene,"
says Bruton. "It's about toilets and
how they are underestimated.
Bathrooms are just so nonchalant and
Tom makes a big deal out of it,
saying, without the bathroom where
would we be? He's saying that the
toilet is a big part of American
livelihood."

Then there's Harold (played by
Louie Alonso), the hard-nosed army
man who doesn't know how to show
h is Icvc for Ethel, his wife.
In one scene, Ethel (played by
Tanya Novak) offers him some milk,
claiming it's a natural. Harold barks
back, "Don't try any of your com
munistic propaganda on me!"
Harold's philosophy of life is
simple: "There's only one thing
worse than a milk-drinking commie,
and that's a man who eats Light &
Lively cottage cheese. Men weren't
meant to be light and lively!"
Ethel struggles to recapture the
man she married 29 years ago, even
though she knows he's been having
an affair — albeit not with another
woman.
Then there's Roxanne (played by
Trancos Resident Fellow Martha
Feldman), the brassy bag lady who is
out to expose exploitation of frozen
foods.
Between her attacks on corporate
capitalism, though, lie some sharp
philosophy: "Thanksgiving doesn't
have any expectation. You don't
dream of a white anything, and you
don't even go dashing through the
snow on a one horse open sleigh. All
we do on Thanksgiving is give thanks
for what we've already got."
