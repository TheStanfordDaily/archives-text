Le Mystere Picasso (1956)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
This astounding film uses the
movie screen as an artist's canvas,
on which paintings spring to
miraculous life. The artist is, of
course, Picasso, and he and director
Henri-Georges Clouzot have come
up with an entirely new way to use
cinema; they show us how the
brushstrokes of a master culminate
into works of art, and they do it by
using a semi-transparent sheet of
canvas behind which Clouzot sets up
his camera. Picasso's special ink
bleeds straight through, so we can
watch him paint without having to
look over his shoulder. Picasso does
15 works, beginning with simple ink
drawings, progressing to startling,
bold water colors, and then, through
the use of more cinema magic (at
Picasso's command, the screen
widens to Cinemascope propor
tions), developing into layered oil
paintings. And for the movie's
entire 75 minutes Picasso plays his
role as master artist, master
magician, master clown. This isn't
dusty, museum-piece art; the spirit
of both the movie and Picasso's
work is joyously playful and
amazingly, refreshingly creative. His
paintings (especially the later ones)
begin as skeletal outlines, then ac
quire detail and depth, and then
transmute into fantastical, abstract
cubism; you can see the stages, and
they all make beautiful sense. It's a
euphoric film, expertly

photographed by Claude Renoir.
Georges Auric provides the perfect
score; a different piece of music, in a
different style, goes with each paint
ing.
Plays through next Thursday.
The Killing Fields (1984)
Skilling Auditorium
Roland Joffe's vision of Cam
bodia in the early 1970s has the im
mediacy of newsreel footage shot by
a poet. As Cambodia and her people
are ravaged by the Lon Nol govern
ment, by the secret American bom
bings, and finally, consummately, by
the Khmer Rouge, Joffe exposes the
tightly packed layers of destruction
and desolation in beautiful,
agonized imagery that may be the
best of its kind ever realized in a
movie. (The superlative cinematog
rapher Chris Menges works at the
top of his form here.) But the
central story of the film — the
friendship between New York
Times correspondent Sydney Schan
berg (Sam Waterston) and his jour
nalist's guide/liaison man Dith Pran
(Dr. Haing S. Ngor), which formed
the basis of Schanberg's moving
piece in The New York Times Mag
azine, "The Death and Life of Dith
Pran," in January 1980 — has no
real power. Joffe must bear some of
the blame for this, but most of it lies
with the screenwriter, Bruce Robin
son, who hasn't provided scenes that
allow the actors to play off each

other in a way that will illuminate
their relationship, and with
Waterston, who is simply inade
quate. The best performances are
given by John Malkovich and (in
much smaller roles) Julian Sands,
Bill Paterson, Athol Fugard and
Craig Nelson.

A Room with a View (1986)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
E.M. Forster described his Ed
wardian romantic/comic novel as
"Clear and bright and well
constructed, but so thin," and that's
a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James
Ivory from an adaptation by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala. Jhabvala's
screenplay is very faithful to Forster,
and preserves much of his beauti
fully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger
thematic, more didactic elements of
the novel (such as Forster's sternly
humanistic belief in the supreme
sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to in
flate the characters' passions; they
keep everything very light, enter
taining and borderline frivolous, and
the movie stays exceptionally neat
and well-constructed simply by fol
lowing Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and
enjoyable group, with the slight ex
ception of Helena Bonham Carter,
whose Lucy Honeychurch doesn't

seem quite the vessel for passion
that Forster intended. She's very
likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith, Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm
Elliot, Julian Sands, Simon Callow,
Rosemary Leach, Judi Deneh and
others.
Plays this week.
Last Tango in Paris (1973)
Pagoda Palace Theater, San Fran
cisco

Bernardo Bertolucci's study of a
neurotic sexual relationship be
tween a middle-aged man — a one
time Bohemian whose wife has just
committed suicide — and a young
French bourgeoise may be the
greatest film of the last 20 years. No
one has ever explored sexuality in
movies in as intimate and unrelent
ing a manner. Bertolucci and Mar
lon Brando, who plays the tragic
hero, are surely the most amazing

director-actor combination since D.
W. Griffith and Lillian Gish; to
describe what Brando does for this
movie would require searching for
new superlatives. With Maria
Schneider, Jean-Pierre Leaud,
Maria Michi and Massimo Giiotti;
screenplay by Bertolucci and Franco
Arcalli; photographed by Vittorio
Storaro; music by Gato Barbieri.
Plays tonight with "9 1/2 Weeks."
