## Sundance is all beefed up

They grow their own. Beef, that is.
Only the freshest ingredients are served at
Sundance — right down to the sides of meat.
The restaurant hand cuts all portions on the
premises.
This place is seriously computerized and
fits in well with the Silicon Valley theme.
We suppose that within a year customers
will be ordering on Scantron sheets.
Even with a reservation and all their high
tech equipment, we had to wait 20 minutes
before being seated. However, the bar, com
plete with brass rail, helped to make the wait
a pleasant one.
The large restaurant is compartmen
talized into a number of small rooms. Each
room is dimly lit and tightly fitted with
tables, all sporting linen cloths and fresh
flowers.
Anticipating a red meat meal, we started
with a good bottle of the buttery 1982 Strat
ford Cabernet Sauvignon.
For an appetizer, we enjoyed the Alder
wood smoked Nova salmon ($5.95). Don't
think such an appetizer is out of place at this
restaurant, which is famous for its beef. Our
waitress mentioned that in an effort to
upgrade its rating, Sundance has expanded
its selections and hosts an ultra-friendly staff

(complete with mental guidelines to follow).
With the salmon, the goal is to create
one's own tasty concoction. On a bed of
fresh lettuce rest a generous portion of
smoked salmon, sliced Bermuda onion,
table water crackers, cream cheese, lemon
wedges and capers. With such a selection of
fresh ingredients that all complement each
other, one can hardly go wrong.
Likewise, with the salads, the customer is
responsible for the final product. One starts
with a mixture of iceburg and romaine
lettuce, along with a fairly standard creamy

vinegrette dressing. The waiter can supply
the freshly ground pepper. Initiative must
then be taken to balance the optional
mixture of bacon bits, roasted garlic
croutons and crumbled Wisconsin bleu
cheese. Luckily, the mounds of tasty bleu
cheese made up for the few disappointing
stale croutons that we found hidden with the
good ones.
Of course, we had to try the Sundance
prime rib. We ordered the full cut ($16.95
versus standard at $13.25 or petite at

$9.95), and were amazed at what arrived. It
was the most enormous single cut of beef
we've ever seen served on a plate — just
slightly smaller than a large shoe.
But what a tender and juicy cut it was!
Horseradish and beef juice were served
alongside the entree, which also included
fresh beans and a choice of baked potato or
steamed rice. Prime rib is certainly the safest
choice on the menu — satisfaction is
guaranteed with this house specialty.
The riskier choices include the beef and
seafood combinations. We tried the sauteed
prawns with prime rib. Next to this dramati
cally smaller cut of beef came only three
small prawns. They were soaking in a pool
of butter, accented with traces of garlic and
lemon flavor. They were good, but left us
craving more (especially with the $15.75
price tag).
We finished the meal with a couple cups
of coffee and a delightful slice of mud pie.
Whipped cream, fudge topping and nuts
adorned the smooth coffee ice cream filling.
We ordered a fairly standard meal at Sun
dance. For the more adventurous, the res
taurant also offers selections such as oysters
Cajun style, Chinese chicken salad, Idaho
Rainbow trout and calamari Vera Cruz.
Entrees range widely from $7.95 to
$20.95. The larger salad inventions are
priced at around $6.
If you haven't a car, Sundance can supply
you with fine service and quality food within
walking distance. Better yet, just wait for
the parents to pick up the sizable tab.
