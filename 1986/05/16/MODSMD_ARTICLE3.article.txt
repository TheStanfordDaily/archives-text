# Fac Sen votes to review grade proposal
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The 1 acuity Senate . oicd yesterday to
re-examine a proposal that would require
students to take courses for a letter grade
in order to fulfill University distribution
requirements.
The proposal was referred back to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C
-US) for a ditional consideration and mod
ificatio' Because the academic year has
nearh ended, any further proposal would
likely not take effect until the 1987-88
school year.
The three-quarter Western Culture re
quirement continues to be the only distri
bution requirement that must be taken for
a letter grade and would not be affected by
any policy changes. Before the 1984-85
school year, students could take the re
quirement pass/no credit.
The proposal, recommended by the C

US, would have also required letter grades
for freshman writing classes, but senate
members balked at limiting grade options
for students who might otherwise avoid
challenging courses.
"It's a dangerous policy to cure abuses
by removing freedoms," said Philosophy
Prof. John Perry.
The proposal was an attempt to address
the "large and increasing phenomenon" of
students choosing the pass/no credit
grading option for courses fulfilling Uni
versity distribution requirements, said
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall, the C-US
chairman.
Committee members were concerned
the option encourages an "absolute mini
malist" student commitment to these
courses, clearly against the principles be
hind requiring students to be familiar with
a variety of disciplines, McCall said.
Abuse of the pass/no credit option and

"decreasing attention from students also
makes the faculty less interested in invest
ing themselves in Vthe course)," said
Carolyn Lougee, dean for Undergraduate
Studies.
The problem appears to be acute in
large lecture courses specifically designed
by departments to encourage enrollment
by a wide variety of students while provid
ing requirement-satisfying courses, McCall
said.
"Statistically, it seems to be precisely
these courses that have been designed
most specifically to cater to distribution re
quirements that these huge numbers of
pass/no credit (options) are taking place,"
McCall said.
Regular departmental offerings which
lead to majors do not have a similar high
incidence of pass/no credit grading,
Lougee said.
Students at the meeting voiced their op

position to the proposal. In a letter dis
tributed to the senate, the ASSU Commit
tee on Undergraduate Residential Educa
tion (URE) said the proposal would un
duly restrict academic scheduling by inad
vertently creating increased grade pres
sures.
"Students will be less inclined to risk the
security of an easy class in an area where
they may not have a natural aptitude," the
letter said. "They would be better served
by a policy that did not discourage ex
perimentation in more interesting and
challenging courses within the same distri
bution area."
Some senate members, though, ques
tioned the motives of many students who
exercise the pass/no credit option. Given
the alleged infrequency of C or D grades
outside of math and science courses, some
students may be using the option to effec
tively "cover" C grades, Law Prof. Robert
Mnookin said.
