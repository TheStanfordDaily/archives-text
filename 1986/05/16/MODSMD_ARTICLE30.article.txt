We have been searching for a long time for
the perfect Chinese restaurant. Chef Chu's,
Peng's, Mui-Kiang and many other local
places have left us in a state of deep chagrin.
Even so, we approached China Delight with
hopes for finding that ideal place to eat.
On the outside, China Delight had a tacky
appearance; it looked like a converted ap
pliance store with Christmas lights on the
windows. The inside was rather pedestrian
even for a Chinese restaurant. However, we
all know that it is not the appearance that
makes a Chinese restaurant — it's the food.
Upon arrival, we were seated promptly by
an attentive waitress. Perusing the menu, we
noted the wide variety of food, including
both Mandarin and Szechwan cuisine.
We started with assorted hot appetizers
($5.25) which included beef teriyaki, paper
wrapped chicken, fried prawns and spring
rolls. The beef teriyaki was the best of all the
appetizers — unusual, considering that
teriyaki is a Japanese dish.
The paper-wrapped chicken is boneless
chicken wrapped in aluminum foil to keep

the juices in. When prepared correctly, the
chicken is very tender, taut and tasty.
However, that evening, the chicken was too
sweet and the texture mushy.
After our appetizers, we ordered sizzling
rice soup ($4.50). In the soup was a hodge
podge of shrimp, green peas, fish balls, water v
chestnuts and carrots. The fried rice added
on top of the soup added a sizzling, crunchy
texture. Either my taste buds went out, or
this soup was very bland. Furthermore, the
carrots were mushy and the rice burnt.
Unfortunately, the main dishes do not get -
much better. For our main courses we or
dered Yu-Shiang scallops ($7.25), Szechwan
shredded beef ($5.50) and broccoli with cas
hews ($4.50). The scallops were cooked in ,■
garlic sauce. They were very tasty and fresh,
and the garlic sauce was well-tempered.
The Szechwan shredded beef was braised
in pepper-corn flavored sauce. It had carrots,
green onions and tiny strips of beef in an •
overly thick sauce. The problem with this
dish was that the pieces of beef were too
small and few, leaving only carrots and green
onions. Finally, the broccoli dish was some
what tasteless and dry, but acceptable.
Overall, although the service was at- .
tentive, the atmosphere decent and the *
prices reasonable, the food lacked the taste •
and freshness we expect from a high quality I
Chinese restaurant. In the end, China I
Delight was no delight.
