# MORE ESSENCE Of MATTER
## Article #3 
### By: Joel Sheinmel 
A review of all responses to my article of May 2nd,
The Essence of Matter, which included a
$2,500.00 award to the first reader who would un
cover a fallacy in the logic employed, has been
completed. The intent had been to have readers
look for a fallacy in either of two derivations that
brought forth a new energy equation,
E = mc7rDf/0. I wish here to thank all those who
took up the challenge.
While no reader was able to identify such a logic fal
lacy, although many contended such, still one reader,
Thilka Sumanaweera, did turn up a mistake in the last
paragraph which is rewritten here.
"If you could be shrunk to atomic dimensions and then
stood next to the proton orbit, you would still on mea
surement obtain the same proton effective mass.
However, if you started to travel in a circle just outside
the proton's circle, you would find when you reached V2
the speed of light, that on measuring the proton's effec
tive mass, its value would be V2 what it was initially
when you were not moving. When you reached the
speed of light, the proton would have disappeared."
Mr. Sumanaweera correctly pointed out that the effec
tive mass, when your speed reached V2 the speed of
light, would be given by Va and not V2 the initial effective
mass. Although this final paragraph had no association
with the derived energy equation and had been added,
too hastily by the author for amusement (a regrettable
decision), still I give credit to Mr. Sumanaweera who
first noticed this mistake and award him the $2,500.00.
Some of you may have questioned why the author
chose to place scientific articles in two university daily
papers rather than submit the papers, using a modified
format, to scientific journals.
My work was completed in December of 1985 after
more than two years of effort. In the following four
months, I was to leam the scientific community holds
dear their preconceived prejudices regarding the birth
place of new knowledge. Convinced knowledge stems
from superior beings, they place themselves within this
noble category. Such ideology is contrary to my own,
for I feel knowledge can make an appearance in any
mind that thinks. Initial attempts to have my work pub
lished in the physics journals proved futile. I lacked the
proper badge (a PhD in physics) for the work to be
taken seriously. The physics journals staffed by some
of these noble men had become Pravdarian publica
tions preaching the party word. Articles appeared writ

ten by party members of good standing, whose work
normally followed closely the party line. The present
party line, in the field of physics, is quantum theory,
that I, a lowly commoner, was challenging. My decision
to display my work in university papers was not one of
choice, but one born of necessity.
Quantum theory, as others had recognized, was a
return to mythological explanations for observed
events. That mythology was requisite for acceptance of
quantum theory was masked in words such as un
determinable and probability. Historically, axiomatic
changes in universal law come slowly. As Einstein
said, "Concepts that have proved useful in the consti
tution of an order of things readily win such an authority
over us that we forget their earthly origin and take them
to be changeless data. Such concepts then become
stamped as necessities of thought, as given a priori, so
that the path of scientific progress often becomes im
passable for a long period." It took 2,000 years to over
throw the Hellenic axiom of an earth centered universe
and Copernicus, who fathered a sun centered uni
verse, was not to see the earth centered axiom
changed in his lifetime. The Newtonian axiom of abso
lute space and time stood for more than 200 years,
before Einstein told us differently and years after intro
ducing special relativity theory he was still an obscure
professor lecturing to classes of three and four stu
dents.
We stand on the threshold of overthrowing another
Newtonian axiom, that of mass. Christened by Newton,
as a constant intrinsic property of all matter, a constant
mass has been with us for more than 300 years. Its age
alone gives it noble status. The new photon energy
equation derived in previous articles showed particle
masses must either be considered variable and depen
dent on rate changes in momentum (orbit size and
velocity), or the mass term abandoned and momentum
treated as a pure physical entity.
New knowledge makes a poor first impression on the
existing palace guard. There is trepidation concerning
future status if old rules, that have supplied a sense of
security, are breached. While intellectuals expound the
requirements to retrain factory workers displaced by
technology advances, their enlightenment wanes when
their own positions appear threatened. Are quantum
physicists truly threatened? I think not. New knowledge
walks with opportunity. We have proposed a new win
dow to our understanding and how much we learn will
depend on how many pass through this window bring
ing with them their loaded minds. In human history we

have never had a time more ripe for discovery. The
quantity of observed data ready for new interpretation
is almost inexhaustable. Those scientists willing to ac
cept ordinary human status will find unlimited opportu
nities. Those who hold tight their human conceit will be
left to sit on their elitist pedestals in ignorance.
With little room remaining, we move from philosophical
ramblings to science and provide the reader with
causality for an inverse square law, that without benefit
of the proper equation remained a scientific mystery.
We begin again with our new energy equation,
E = mc7rDf/0, where
E = Energy
m = Proton rest mass
c = Velocity of light
7tD = Photon orbit circumference
112 = Frequency of orbit, in cycles/sec
8 = Actual photon orbit/min photon orbit
E is E/time or E/sec
E/cycle = mc7rD/0 = constant = h
Force = energy/displacement
The displacement in one cycle is the circle size, 77-D,
thus:
Force/cycle = mc/ 0
Force/sec = force/cycle * cycles/sec
Force/sec = mcf/0
8 is actual orbit divided by minimum orbit. Thus, 8 is a
measure of distance in terms of discrete numbers of
minimum orbits.
As 8, a distance statement goes from 1 to 2, 112 goes to
1 /2 its initial value and thus force goes to V* its initial
value. In keeping with observation, force falls off with
the square of the distance.
NOTE: Displacement is normally given as the straight
line distance between initial and final points. The circu
lar displacement nD above is a straight line when a
photon travels in a circle (i.e. when spacetime is
defined as circular).
