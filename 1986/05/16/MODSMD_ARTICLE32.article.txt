## Women advance despite rain delay Stanford thunders past Harvard 8-1 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas — Upon hearing
that his top-seeded team would be
playing Harvard in the first round of
the NCAA Tennis Championships,
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan joked
that the only concern for the Cardinal
would be to avoid falling asleep on
the courts.
Brennan's worries were washed
away here yesterday as early morning
thunderstorms delayed the scheduled
8:30 a.m. match for two hours, allow
ing the Stanford players to sleep in
until 9 a.m. The well-rested Cardinal
went on to quickly eliminate the
Crimson 8-1 to advance to today's
quarterfinals and raise its record to
18-1.
After playing on the Texas intra
mural courts yesterday, Stanford will
move to center stage today at the
Penick-Allison Tennis Center. The
Cardinal will battle the No. 9 seed,
Northwestern, which upset No. 8
UCLA yesterday 6-3. The match is
scheduled to begin at 9 a.m.
Fully expecting to leave at 7:15
a.m. for their first-round match yes
terday, the Stanford players woke up
to a powerful thunderstorm. When
the match finally commenced,
however, the only thunder to be
heard was coming from the Cardinal
rackets.
"I was very pleased with the inten
sity," Breennan said. "Everyone had
good matches."
Stanford freshman Marianne Wer
del was not only good, she was almost
peifect. Playing in the No. 2 singles
match, Werdel shut out Harvard's
Cindy Buchsbaum 6-0, 6-0, giving up
only 10 points in the two sets.
" Marianne can do that to you," Bren
nan said.
The Cardinal's perfection contin
ued in the No. 3 singles as junior
Leigh Anne Eldredge defeated the
Crimson's Erika Smith 6-0, 6-0 to
give Stanford a 2-0 lead in the match.
Junior Patty Fendick was a little
more generous to her Harvard op
ponent — but not much. The Crim
son's Kathy Vigna fell to the Stanford
All-American 6-1, 6-1 in the No. 1
Singles.
The onslaught continued as J Kay
Tittle, a native of Texas, made quick
work of Cyndy Austrian 6-2, 6-0.

Tittle, who missed a couple of weeks
of action at the end of April due to il
lnesses and then struggled upon re
turning to the lineup, saw yesterday's
match as important preparation for
the rest of the tournament.
"I was nervous — one, because it
was the first match at nationals, and
two, because I needed a win," Tittle
said. "My last couple of matches have
been shaky."
"Kay played well," Brennan said.
"We needed her to get back on the
winning track."

Harvard finally broke through in
the No. 4 singles as Robin Voss upset
Stanford's Stephanie Savides 6-4, 6-
1. Trailing 4-1 in the first set, Savides
came to within 5-4 before Voss broke
her serve to take the set. A frustrated
Savides never challenged Voss in the
second set.
"I was definitely nervous," Savides
said. "I knew that too. I'm usually
kind of bad when I haven't played in
a while. If my match would have
really mattered, I knew I could have
pulled it out."
"If it's not a pressure match, she
(Savides) tends to struggle," Brennan
said. "When the pressure's on, she

comes through. She handled it (the
loss) well."
"Tomorrow, I'll be more psyched,"
Savides said of today's quarterfinal.
Stanford's Cari Hagey put an end
to whatever far-fetched hopes Har
vard had of advancing to the next
round. The Cardinal sophomore
knocked off Martha Berkman 6-2, 6-
2 in the No. 6 singles to clinch the
team victory. "Cari played a good
match," Brennan said. "That girl
(Berkman) was good."
The doubles matches were played
with as much intenstiy as the singles,
despite the fact that the overall match
had been decided. After winning 6-1
in the first set of the No. 1 doubles,
Fendick and Eldredge rallied to
capture the second set 7-5 over Smith
and Vigna.
The best comeback of the day was
recorded by Tittle and Werdel in the
No. 3 doubles. Down 5-0 in the first
set, the Stanford pair won 13 of the
next 15 games against Austrian and
Buchsbaum to take the match 7-5, 6-
2.
Savides and Hagey upped their
doubles record to 22-4 with a 6-4, 7-
6 victory in the No. 2 doubles over
Voss and Berkman.
The news of Northwestern's upset
of UCLA travelled quickly through
the Cardinal ranks shortly after they
had clinched the victory over Har
vard.
"I'm glad we're playing Northwest
ern," Savides said. "We've always
had a problem with UCLA."
"I'm pleased to be playing a new
team," Brennan agreed. "Very
honestly, the last time we played
UCLA, it was 5-4 (May 2)."
Northwestern's victory over UCLA
was no fluke. The individual match
scores were not close. In the first four
singles matches to finish, the Wildcats
won 48 games to 18 for the Bruins.
Adding to Northwestern's reputation
is its 26-3 overall record.
"They did beat UCLA, so you've
got to give them some respect,"
Brennan said.
Stanford has not played North
western during Brennan's tenure as
coach, but he is not overly concerned
by the Wildcat mystique. "In a way,
we don't know the team," he said.
"But we certainly know the players."
