# The 						theatrics of collegiate tennis

There Luke Jensen was, jump
ing up and down like a little kid
whose mom wouldn't buy him an
ice cream. But he wasn't on a
street corner — he was in the
middle of Maples Pavilion.
The superstar freshman from
USC had just wasted two match
points against Stanford's Jim
Grabb, so it was time to pout.
And the fans hissed at Jensen's
infantile display. That's right, a
couple hundred of the 2,000 didn't
like his behavior.
That's the way it often goes in
the world of tennis — emotional
displays aren't very welcome. If a
player curses, he gets a code viola
tion warning. If he does it again,
the other player gets a penalty
point. After that, it's penalty
games and then the match.
The crowd doesn't put up with

much either. Michael Kures of
UCLA pumps his fist when he
forces an opponent to make a
mistake, and the fans boo or make
snide remarks.
So, what's the result? Creativity.
The players can't yell at anyone
else to pump themselves up. They
can't vent their anger through foul
language. And they don't want to
get the crowd on their backs.
So they either insult themselves,
or yell nonsense words. It may not
be as exciting as a hockey brawl,
but it's a lot funnier.
For Stanford's Patrick
McEnroe, the favorite word on the
court is "Sugar." Usually, though,
it's more like
"SUGARummmph." There's
nothing the umpire can say about
that.
McEnroe has had some random
outbursts that were even more en

tennis today. After each shot, the fiery Cardinal lets out a noise

tertaining. Against Georgia Tech's
Richey Gilbert earlier this year, a
McEnroe shot hit the tape of the net
and fell back on his side.
He immediately pounced on the
ball, held it six inches from his face
and screamed, "Annoy me." How
many other times have you seen
somebody scold a ball?
Later in that match, McEnroe
netted a backhand and stopped in his
tracks to address the crowd. "That
makes me want to puke right here on
the court." Now that would make one
helluva picture, eh?
Insulting themselves is a favorite
pastime of frustrated players. Mike
Chinchiolo of Georgia Tech routed
Stanford's John Letts 6-0 in the first
set of their match in February. But
then Chinchiolo lost all control of his
serve and Letts came storming back.
After double faulting a game away,
Chinchiolo had finally had enough.
"You," he said to himself, "serve like
my sister."
UCLA's Brad Pearce is a master of
sarcasm. After hitting an easy

forehand way wide against Stanford's
Dan Goldie, Pearce looked up to the
crowd and gave some free commen
tary.
"Oooh, that was good. Anybody
get a picture of that one?" he said.
Of course the temptation was too
much for one fan, who quickly
snapped "Yup, got one."
Sometimes the sarcasm can border
on despair. Arizona State's Ken
Kuperstein was losing the final set 5-
l in a match against Letts when he
turned to the fans and announced,
"Did everyone have a good time out
here while I was having the worst
hour of my life?"
Arizona's lan Aler disregards self
depracating remarks and simply
slides into the incomprehensible.
Translated, that means he does baby
talk.
After making a bad lob in a
doubles match against Stanford and
having the ball slammed back in his
face, Aler hopped around in a circle
and chanted something that sounded
like "sugar-lime-bear-cheese-crisp
sky -falafel." Uh, yeah.
Now that we're into full fledged
silliness, it's time to go to the first an
nual On-Court Shenanigans awards.

Take nothing that follows seriously.
The Gene Muuch Launching Pad
Award.
Stanford's Scott Moody wins this
year's award, which is given in honor
of baseball manager Mauch who
flung several dozen bats onto the field
in frustration one fine summer after
noon.
The Thin Man Award.
Long Beach State's scrawny fresh
man Greg Failla receives the honor
by public mandate. One fan who was
watching Failla play Grabb quipped,
"I bet a strong wind would blow that
kid right off the court."
The Mayor of Carmel Award
Stanford Coach Dick Gould picks
up this one for his uncanny imitation
of Clint Eastwood's gunslinger walk
(when Mayor Eastwood was doing
westerns). One fan this year asked
the question everyone wanted to ask:
"Why does Gould always walk on the
court like he's in a showdown at high
noon?"
The "No, I'm not constipated"
Trophy
Rosenfeld takes this one simply for
the frequency of his grunts. The
senior from Media, Penn., emits a
"harumpthhh" on every shot.
