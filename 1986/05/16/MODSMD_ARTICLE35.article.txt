# Crimson up first for Cardinal
## Men to face strong field, rowdy crowd at NCAAs 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The wild and woolly fans from the
University of Georgia should have
ample opportunity to exercise their
vocal cords at the NCAA champion
ships this weekend.
The Athens spectators, who have
been known to chant "Woof, woof
woof," to cheer on their Bulldog
players, will probably be watching
one of the more wide open cham
pionships of the recent past.
In the opinion of several coaches,
any one of the top six seeds could
walk away with the team crown on
Tuesday.
Stanford is at the cut-off of that
group, seeded sixth in the tourna
ment. But being on the outskirts of
the group should bring back some
good memories for the Stanford
players.
Three years ago, Coach Dick
Gould's Cardinal squad featured four
freshman starters, and even though
the team was seeded second, it wasn't
given much of chance to win it all be
cause of inexperience.
Those four freshmen came through
in the clutch, and Stanford did win it
all by defeating top-seeded SMU 5-2
in the finals.
This year those four players are
seniors, but their task will be the
same — knock out the top-seeded
Mustangs of SMU. In order for the
Cardinal players to do that, however,
they will have to reach the finals, and
there are several top-notch teams
standing in the way.
Tomorrow at 8 a.m. EST, Stanford
will kick-off the tourney against the
Crimson of Harvard. NCAA officials
seem to have a fetish about matching
up Stanford and Harvard squads —
the Cardinal and the Crimson have
met in the first round of two out of
the last three NCAA championships
and were also paired up in this year's
ITCA indoor championships.
Stanford won all three of those
matches, including a close 5-3 win
over the Crimson in February. Har
vard Coach Dave Fish thinks the

trend will probably continue.
"We played a great match against
Stanford in February when it was 3-3
after singles," he said. "But I have a
feeling that that is the closest we'll
come this year."
Stanford will be counting on the
play of the four experienced seniors.
Dan Goldie, Jim Grabb, John Letts
and Eric Rosenfeld have all played at
the No. 1 or No. 2 positions on the
team at some point in their Cardinal
careers.
The other two players in the Card
inal lineup will be sophomore Patrick
McEnroe and junior Scott Moody.
McEnroe boasts the best record on
the team at 17-3, while Moody has
posted an 11-9 mark playing mostly
at the No. 6 spot.
Harvard will enter tomorrow s con
test with a 17-5 record overall, 9-0 in
the Eastern Intercollegiate Tennis
Association (which is really just the
Ivy League plus Army and Navy).
The Crimson s top three players are
seniors Larry Scott and Bill Stanley
and junior captain Peter Palanjian.
Scott upset Goldie 6-1, 6-4 in
February's ITCA match, and Stanley
defeated Letts in that same tourr.;
ment. so the Crimson do pose at least
a small threat.

"Those guys can certainly play, so
we better be ready to go in that
match," Gould said.
Fish, however, isn't too optimistic.
"We're going to have to play really
well, and Stanford will only have to
play regular (to win)," he said.
If the Cardinal gels by Harvard, the
third-seeded Clemson Tigers will
probably be next on the agenda.
Gould is very wary of Clemson.
"They've been so close for so long
that I'm kind of looking for them to
put it all together," Gould said.
"They're going to come at us hard
right from the start. It's going to be a
dogfight."
Clemson is now healthy for the first
time all year. Sophomore Jay Berger,
the Tigers' top player, has been
injured off and on all year, and junior
Brandon Walters has also been hur
ting. But now that all his Tigers are
healthy, Coach Chuck Kriese will be
looking to improve on the team's 30-
6 record.
If Stanford also beats Clemson, the
Cardinal will probably face second
seeded UCLA in the semifinals on
Monday. But that "probability" can
probably be thrown out the window,
because as far as the coaches are con

cerned, anything could happen this
weekend.
"A lot of teams have about an
equal chance (of winning the champi
onship)," SMU Coach Dennis
Ralston said. "UCLA, Clemson,
USC, Pepperdine and Stanford all
have a good shot.
"Whoever wins it will have to be at
the top of their game from the first
round," Ralston said.
Although SMU is seeded first,
Gould isn't putting his money on the
Mustangs.
"I wouldn't bet against a West
Coast team, ever," Gould said.
Indeed, since 1960, Texas (1972)
and Georgia (1985) are the only two
non-California teams to win the
Championships.
Fish, however, thinks SMU will be
the one this year.
"I think SMU is the team to beat,"
Fish said. "They have the record
against the other teams in the tour
ney. But I don't know how they'll
play on the slower courts."
Of course, who knows how any of
the visitors will play on Georgia's
home court? If the Athens fans really
get going, the Bulldogs could sneak
up and take it all.


Patrick McEnroe's 17-3 singles record this season is the best on the Stanford team. The Cardinal will need
McEnroe to continue his winning ways if Stanford is to challenge for the NCAA tennis title. Stanford plays its
first-round match today against Harvard.

Ivy League plus Army and Navy).
The Crimson s top three players are
seniors Larry Scott and Bill Stanley
and junior captain Peter Palanjian.
Scott upset Goldie 6-1, 6-4 in
February's ITCA match, and Stanley
defeated Letts in that same tourr.;
ment. so the Crimson do pose at least
a small threat.

"Those guys can certainly play, so
we better be ready to go in that
match," Gould said.
Fish, however, isn't too optimistic.
"We're going to have to play really
well, and Stanford will only have to
play regular (to win)," he said.
If the Cardinal gels by Harvard, the
third-seeded Clemson Tigers will
probably be next on the agenda.
Gould is very wary of Clemson.
"They've been so close for so long
that I'm kind of looking for them to
put it all together," Gould said.
"They're going to come at us hard
right from the start. It's going to be a
dogfight."
Clemson is now healthy for the first
time all year. Sophomore Jay Berger,
the Tigers' top player, has been
injured off and on all year, and junior
Brandon Walters has also been hur
ting. But now that all his Tigers are
healthy, Coach Chuck Kriese will be
looking to improve on the team's 30-
6 record.
If Stanford also beats Clemson, the
Cardinal will probably face second
seeded UCLA in the semifinals on
Monday. But that "probability" can
probably be thrown out the window,
because as far as the coaches are con

cerned, anything could happen this
weekend.
"A lot of teams have about an
equal chance (of winning the champi
onship)," SMU Coach Dennis
Ralston said. "UCLA, Clemson,
USC, Pepperdine and Stanford all
have a good shot.
"Whoever wins it will have to be at
the top of their game from the first
round," Ralston said.
Although SMU is seeded first,
Gould isn't putting his money on the
Mustangs.
"I wouldn't bet against a West
Coast team, ever," Gould said.
Indeed, since 1960, Texas (1972)
and Georgia (1985) are the only two
non-California teams to win the
Championships.
Fish, however, thinks SMU will be
the one this year.
"I think SMU is the team to beat,"
Fish said. "They have the record
against the other teams in the tour
ney. But I don't know how they'll
play on the slower courts."
Of course, who knows how any of
the visitors will play on Georgia's
home court? If the Athens fans really
get going, the Bulldogs could sneak
up and take it all.


Patrick McEnroe's 17-3 singles record this season is the best on the Stanford team. The Cardinal will need
McEnroe to continue his winning ways if Stanford is to challenge for the NCAA tennis title. Stanford plays its
first-round match today against Harvard.
The wild and woolly fans from the
University of Georgia should have
ample opportunity to exercise their
vocal cords at the NCAA champion
ships this weekend.
The Athens spectators, who have
been known to chant "Woof, woof
woof," to cheer on their Bulldog
players, will probably be watching
one of the more wide open cham
pionships of the recent past.
In the opinion of several coaches,
any one of the top six seeds could
walk away with the team crown on
Tuesday.
Stanford is at the cut-off of that
group, seeded sixth in the tourna
ment. But being on the outskirts of
the group should bring back some
good memories for the Stanford
players.
Three years ago, Coach Dick
Gould's Cardinal squad featured four
freshman starters, and even though
the team was seeded second, it wasn't
given much of chance to win it all be
cause of inexperience.
Those four freshmen came through
in the clutch, and Stanford did win it
all by defeating top-seeded SMU 5-2
in the finals.
This year those four players are
seniors, but their task will be the
same — knock out the top-seeded
Mustangs of SMU. In order for the
Cardinal players to do that, however,
they will have to reach the finals, and
there are several top-notch teams
standing in the way.
Tomorrow at 8 a.m. EST, Stanford
will kick-off the tourney against the
Crimson of Harvard. NCAA officials
seem to have a fetish about matching
up Stanford and Harvard squads —
the Cardinal and the Crimson have
met in the first round of two out of
the last three NCAA championships
and were also paired up in this year's
ITCA indoor championships.
Stanford won all three of those
matches, including a close 5-3 win
over the Crimson in February. Har
vard Coach Dave Fish thinks the

trend will probably continue.
"We played a great match against
Stanford in February when it was 3-3
after singles," he said. "But I have a
feeling that that is the closest we'll
come this year."
Stanford will be counting on the
play of the four experienced seniors.
Dan Goldie, Jim Grabb, John Letts
and Eric Rosenfeld have all played at
the No. 1 or No. 2 positions on the
team at some point in their Cardinal
careers.
The other two players in the Card
inal lineup will be sophomore Patrick
McEnroe and junior Scott Moody.
McEnroe boasts the best record on
the team at 17-3, while Moody has
posted an 11-9 mark playing mostly
at the No. 6 spot.
Harvard will enter tomorrow s con
test with a 17-5 record overall, 9-0 in
the Eastern Intercollegiate Tennis
Association (which is really just the
Ivy League plus Army and Navy).
The Crimson s top three players are
seniors Larry Scott and Bill Stanley
and junior captain Peter Palanjian.
Scott upset Goldie 6-1, 6-4 in
