# Women at Pac-West meet
## Throwers, distance runners key for Card 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
A conference meet should be a big deal. For some of
the athletes it's the culmination of a year of hard work.
For others it's an important stepping-stone on the way
to national competition.
For the Stanford women's track team, this
weekend's Pac-West Conference Championships in
Tempe, Ariz., will be important, hut the meet might
not be all that you would expect it to be.
Next year the Pac-West will be disbanded, and the
women will compete in the Pacific 10 Conference, but
for this year the Cardinal will have to settle for the Pac-
West.
"We'll be happy to have a legitimate conference
with some legitimate electricity and excitement instead
of a hyphenated event," Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson said.
Johnson calls it a hyphenated event because the Pac-
West is composed of only five teams, Stanford,
Arizona, Arizona State, USC and UCLA. This year
UCLA has decided to skip the conference meet in fa
vor of a Pepsi Invitational being held on its own track,
so the conference meet will turn out to be a four-team
affair.
And with UCLA missing, the conference crown
should end up on the head of USC, whose strong sprint
crew will most likely be able to sweep the sprints, a feat
which wouldn't have been so easy had UCLA decided
to bring its sprinters.
The Cardinal should be involved in a battle for
second with Arizona, while Arizona State should bring
up the rear.
To take second from the Wildcats, Stanford will be

relying heavily on a flock of points from its throwers
and distance runners, the two groups which have
carried the squad all season.
Sporting a recent best of 56-feet-B'/2, senior Pam
Dukes will be the favorite to win the shot put. The
event figures to be a three-way battle between Dukes,
Arizona's Carla Garrett and USC's Diane Clemens. II
any of those three should falter, Stanford freshman
Patty Purpur, the conference's fourth-ranked shot
putter, could find her way to a top-three finish.
In the discus, Stanford will be hoping for high
finishes from Dukes and Purpur, as well as senior
Karen Nickerson, the conference's No. 2 thrower.
UCLA's Toni Cotjens, the top-ranked thrower, will
most likely leave her team in Los Angeles and come to
the meet to compete against the Cardinal throwers.
Cotjens would have to be the favorite, but recently
Nickerson has been on a upward climb, while Cotjens
has been going down. Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wol-
Iman believes that this could be Nickerson's chance to
"surprise some people."'
In the distances, Johnson will be hoping for some big
points from a trio of Cardinal runners. Seniors Ceci
Hopp and Alison Wiley and freshman Kim Stevens
should all be in a position for a high finish.
Hopp and Wiley will most likely enter the 3,000
meters and the 5,000, and Stevens will most likely en
ter the 1,500 and 5,000. Hopp, a former NCAA cham
pion. has yet to qualify for this year's national cham
pionships. so her time as well as her tinish will be im
portant to the Cardinal.
Other athletes to watch will be Denise Gatzambide,
the conference's second- ranked heptathlete, and Pam
Board. Board, whom Johnson thinks is "due to break
through," will enter the 400 intermediate hurdles.
