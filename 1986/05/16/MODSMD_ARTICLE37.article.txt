# Stanford signs 'perfect' pitcher, five others

And the rich get richer.
The Stanford baseball team, already possess
ing the deepest pitching staff in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division and two young
power hitters in Ed Sprague and Ron Wit
meyer, strengthened itself in both areas with the
addition of six outstanding recruits.
"We're very pleased," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "This is one of our better
recruiting years. All of these guys have been
highly recruited and highly touted."
Asst. Coach Dean Stotz agreed. "This is as
good a class as we've had," he said.
With returning starters Jack McDowell and
Lee Plemel and relievers Rob Wassenaar, A 1
Osuna, Steve Chitren and Brian Keyser, plus
the potential comeback of 1985 relief ace Rick
Dietz, the Cardinal's signing of two top high
school pitching stars may be an injustice to the
other Six-Pac teams comparable to Philadelphia
and Boston getting the first two picks in the
NBA draft.
The man who is the real eye-opener is
righthander Robbie Kamerschen of Athens,
Ga. What makes him stand out are his zeroes, as

in zero losses and zero earned runs. That's right,
Kamerschen has a 0.00 ERA to go along with
eight wins and 106 strikeouts in only 48 innings
this season.
"Unbelievable, isn't it?" Marquess said of
Kamerschen's numbers. "The guy is just
amazing. 1 don't know what the competition is
like, but I've heard it's pretty good. But even if
it was against Little League hitters, it would be
phenomenal."
Kamerschen's second sport is football, in
which he merely led Clarke Central High
School to the state championship and was
named 1985 Georgia Player of the Year. He
may walk on at Stanford.
Stanford's other pitching recruit, Mark Car
per, is "only" 6-1 with a 1.50 ERA this season.
The righthander from Highland, Md., has
fanned 80 in 52 innings.
The Cardinal's main weakness this season has
been a lack of offensive punch, with only 31
homers in 56 games, but with the addition of
three power-hitting recruits and the continued
development of freshmen Sprague and Wit
meyer, the Stanford offense may rely more on
thunder than lightning in the future.
"The complexion of the team will change,"
Marquess said. "We won't have as much speed

with Walt Harris and Mark Davis graduating,
but we will have more power with Sprague, Wit
meyer, Brian Johnson, Paul Carey and Eric
Cox,"
Johnson, accepted as a football recruit, hit
over .500 during his sophomore season at
Skyline High School in Oakland. Johnson can
play both catcher and shortstop, but Marquess
doesn't expect to use him behind the plate.
"He prefers infield, and that's where we'll try
him — shortstop, third base or second base,"
Marquess said.
Even without Johnson, Stanford should have
a capable replacement for John Ramos in 1988,
or next year if the Cardinal receiver decides to
turn pro after his junior year, in Cox, a 6-foot- 2,
175-pounder from Yorba Linda. Considered
one of the top catching prospects in California,
the left-handed hitting Cox batted .397 in his
junior year.
Perhaps the most promising of Stanford's
power hitting prospects is first baseman
outfielder Carey (no relation to Stanford
shortstop Frank Carey). The 6-4, 215-pounder
from Weymouth, Mass., hit .430 and blasted
eight home runs in 86 at-bats in his junior year
at Boston College High School.
Marquess expects either Carey or Witmeyer

to be his first baseman of the future, with the
other moving to the outfield.
Stanford's final recruit is infielder Troy Paul
sen of Fountain Valley. As a junior, Paulsen
was named All-County by both the Los Angeles
Times and the Orange County Register.
Marquess believes that this year's recruiting
class is comparable to last year's, from which
Stanford has gotten large contributions from
Sprague, Witmeyer, Carey and Chitren.
"Maybe not quite as many (will contribute as
freshmen), but the quality is about the same,"
Marquess said. "We've gotten our biggest con
tribution (from freshmen) this year. Normally,
only pitchers come in and contribute right
away."
Card notes
UCLA will host one of the two NCAA West
regionals, as Jackie Robinson Stadium was
named as a regional site. Stanford is still a can
didate for the other, along with Washington
State, Hawaii, San Diego State and Arizona.
Arizona plays Arizona State this weekend in
the Six-Pac season finale. The Wildcats could
tie Stanford at 18-12 with a sweep, but the
Cardinal would still take second place due to a
4-2 advantage in the season series.

but we will have more power with Sprague, Wit
meyer, Brian Johnson, Paul Carey and Eric
Cox,"
Johnson, accepted as a football recruit, hit
over .500 during his sophomore season at
Skyline High School in Oakland. Johnson can
play both catcher and shortstop, but Marquess
doesn't expect to use him behind the plate.
"He prefers infield, and that's where we'll try
him — shortstop, third base or second base,"
Marquess said.
Even without Johnson, Stanford should have
a capable replacement for John Ramos in 1988,
or next year if the Cardinal receiver decides to
turn pro after his junior year, in Cox, a 6-foot- 2,
175-pounder from Yorba Linda. Considered
one of the top catching prospects in California,
the left-handed hitting Cox batted .397 in his
junior year.
Perhaps the most promising of Stanford's
power hitting prospects is first baseman
outfielder Carey (no relation to Stanford
shortstop Frank Carey). The 6-4, 215-pounder
from Weymouth, Mass., hit .430 and blasted
eight home runs in 86 at-bats in his junior year
at Boston College High School.
Marquess expects either Carey or Witmeyer

to be his first baseman of the future, with the
other moving to the outfield.
Stanford's final recruit is infielder Troy Paul
sen of Fountain Valley. As a junior, Paulsen
was named All-County by both the Los Angeles
Times and the Orange County Register.
Marquess believes that this year's recruiting
class is comparable to last year's, from which
Stanford has gotten large contributions from
Sprague, Witmeyer, Carey and Chitren.
"Maybe not quite as many (will contribute as
freshmen), but the quality is about the same,"
Marquess said. "We've gotten our biggest con
tribution (from freshmen) this year. Normally,
only pitchers come in and contribute right
away."
Card notes
UCLA will host one of the two NCAA West
regionals, as Jackie Robinson Stadium was
named as a regional site. Stanford is still a can
didate for the other, along with Washington
State, Hawaii, San Diego State and Arizona.
Arizona plays Arizona State this weekend in
the Six-Pac season finale. The Wildcats could
tie Stanford at 18-12 with a sweep, but the
Cardinal would still take second place due to a
4-2 advantage in the season series.
And the rich get richer.
The Stanford baseball team, already possess
ing the deepest pitching staff in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division and two young
power hitters in Ed Sprague and Ron Wit
meyer, strengthened itself in both areas with the
addition of six outstanding recruits.
"We're very pleased," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "This is one of our better
recruiting years. All of these guys have been
highly recruited and highly touted."
Asst. Coach Dean Stotz agreed. "This is as
good a class as we've had," he said.
With returning starters Jack McDowell and
Lee Plemel and relievers Rob Wassenaar, A 1
Osuna, Steve Chitren and Brian Keyser, plus
the potential comeback of 1985 relief ace Rick
Dietz, the Cardinal's signing of two top high
school pitching stars may be an injustice to the
other Six-Pac teams comparable to Philadelphia
and Boston getting the first two picks in the
NBA draft.
The man who is the real eye-opener is
righthander Robbie Kamerschen of Athens,
Ga. What makes him stand out are his zeroes, as

in zero losses and zero earned runs. That's right,
Kamerschen has a 0.00 ERA to go along with
eight wins and 106 strikeouts in only 48 innings
this season.
"Unbelievable, isn't it?" Marquess said of
Kamerschen's numbers. "The guy is just
amazing. 1 don't know what the competition is
like, but I've heard it's pretty good. But even if
it was against Little League hitters, it would be
phenomenal."
Kamerschen's second sport is football, in
which he merely led Clarke Central High
School to the state championship and was
named 1985 Georgia Player of the Year. He
may walk on at Stanford.
Stanford's other pitching recruit, Mark Car
per, is "only" 6-1 with a 1.50 ERA this season.
The righthander from Highland, Md., has
fanned 80 in 52 innings.
The Cardinal's main weakness this season has
been a lack of offensive punch, with only 31
homers in 56 games, but with the addition of
three power-hitting recruits and the continued
development of freshmen Sprague and Wit
meyer, the Stanford offense may rely more on
thunder than lightning in the future.
"The complexion of the team will change,"
Marquess said. "We won't have as much speed

with Walt Harris and Mark Davis graduating,
but we will have more power with Sprague, Wit
meyer, Brian Johnson, Paul Carey and Eric
Cox,"
Johnson, accepted as a football recruit, hit
over .500 during his sophomore season at
