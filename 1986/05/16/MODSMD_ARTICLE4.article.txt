# Up jumps spring Band

"A little Madness in the Spring
Is wholesome even for the King."
Every spring the Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band heeds the words of poet Emily
Dickinson and brings much wholesomeness to the
Stanford campus.
The Band's peculiar brand of musical madness
takes on a newness in the spring: a new drum major,
new Dollies and most of all, new Band members.

After cutting its numbers to 45 for the Red Vest
Band during basketball season winter quarter, the
I.SJUMB opens its ranks during spring quarter.
Recruiting posters bear the slogan, 'If you can
breathe, you can play," and the traditional theme
song "Come Join the Band" takes on a universal
appeal.
"Our big push is to give everyone who always
wanted to be in the Band the chance to be in the
Band," says Asst. Band Manager Todd Olson. "In
the fall, we definitely have tryouts. Spring Band
gives people a chance to give it a try, learn
the music and give it a shot in the fall."
"We try to be a loose group, let everyone
have a lot of fun playing," says new Drum
Major Brian Pike, who made his debut
during the all-campus rally on the first night
of spring quarter. "We try to bring up some
new music, too."
Manager Jeff Stevens estimates Spring
Band membership at 125, but says "we
don't get all of them at any one point."
"It's a very nebulous group," says Olson.
"The size of the Band varies tremendously."
Equally as nebulous as the Spring Band's
membership is the group's array of public
appearances.
"The rallies are very different (from fall
Band rallies)," says Olson. "It's an incredi
bly random selection of things — everything
from weddings to corporate parties. We also
play a lot of sporting events."
Recent appearances included the Rinc-a
delt party, the Stanford Special Olympics, a
city parade in Mountain View and a GLAS
picnic.
In one memorable rally, the Band met Ol
son's grandmother at the San Francisco Air
port and serenaded her as she came off the
plane on her 80th birthday.
"It's informal, and it's true that you don't
have to be a trained musician," says sopho
more Murray Monroe, who joined the
LSJUMB drum section this spring after
never having played in an organized musical
group before. "You just go out and have a
good time."
The Band members won't be the only
ones having a good time at tomorrow's

Splendor on the Grass appearance. They'll
be joined by the five new Dollies (freshmen
Katie Genshlea, Dineen Johnson, Julie
Nasif and Vicky Takatsuka, and sophomore
Lisa Larragoite) making their all-campus
debut.
The Manzanita Park coming-out party is
the culmination of over two months of prep
aration by the new Dollies, who were selec
ted by the Band on March 2.
Over spring vacation, each Dollie was re
sponsible for choreographing a dance
routine for a Band song, according to Olson.
In addition, there are five traditional
routines — including "The William Tell
Overture," "Come Join the Band" and
"She's Not There" — which the outgoing
group of Dollies pass on to the new
fivesome.
Since the beginning of spring quarter, the
new Dollies have been practicing for two
hours a day, six days a week, dancing to
tapes of the Band made from rehearsals or
off of Band albums.
"It's been a lot of hard work," Johnson
says."I think we're getting ready."
"It takes a lot of cooperation," Genshlea
says of being a Dollie. She described the
pre-debut mood of the group as
"apprehensive."
But tomorrow's performance won't be the
Dollies' first. They made their public debut
Monday night, performing at the gala
opening of the China Delight restaurant in
Sunnyvale. Wednesday night they danced at
a function at the business school, Olson
says.
According to Johnson, the Dollies have
11 routines prepared for Splendour on the
Grass, and will know over 25 by the time
they pass on their mantle next spring.
Olson says that another new feature of the
Band will be increased interaction between

the Dollies and the "Tree." Freshman
Carole Sams, who has been the Tree since
about halfway through winter quarter, will
work together with the Dollies on some
dance routines, according to Olson.
"I'm so impressed with Carole," says Ol
son. "She's got a lot of really creative
ideas."
While the Band enjoys its rites of spring,
it is also looking forward to the fall. The
group hopes to travel to Austin for the foot
ball opener against the University of Texas
in September.
But the Band has something more than a
jaunt to the Lone Star State slated for the
fall. On Thanksgiving weekend, the group
plans to accompany the team to Tokyo for
the Mirage Bowl against the University of
Arizona.
"It's going to be interesting," Olson says
of the trip. "We'll have to be a bit more
restrained than usual, but they (the or
ganizers of the Tokyo game) don't want us
to march, they just want us to do our thing."
Olson says the Band will take about 100
members and 10 DoJI/es (last year's squad in
addition to this year s) to the game. The
group will leave on Wednesday, cross the
date line and arrive in Tokyo on Thursday
night, effectively missing Thanksgiving.
The Band will then spend "a lot of time in
recording studios," Olson says, explaining
that the Mirage Bowl sponsors want to play
taped music continuously throughout the
game.
Aside from the two trips, there are also
some plans to make a Band album, the first
recording since the infamous 1982-83 Band
cut an LP.
"The album is tentative," says Olson.
"We're working on getting funding for
it. . . . We don't want to make an album just
for the sake of making an album."
