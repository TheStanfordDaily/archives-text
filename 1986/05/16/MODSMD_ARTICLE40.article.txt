AUSTIN, Texas â€” USC and Stanford, the nation's
top two teams, dominated the Pac-West Conference
women's tennis honors released earlier this week.
Cardinal juniors Patty Fendick and Leigh Anne
Eldredge and freshman Marianne Werdel were named
to the all-conference team, and Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan was honored as the conference Coach of the
Year.
"It's the best conference in the country," Brennan
said. "To be selected Coach of the Year is great. Being
voted by your peers is something special."
USC's Caroline Kuhlman received the Pac-West
Most Valuable Player award. The Trojan sophomore is
undefeated in singles this season and is currently the
nation's top-ranked player.
Fendick was selected as the conference's No. 2
singles player. With yesterday's victory over Harvard's
Kathy Vigna, she is now 21-7 on the season.
The Trojans' Heliane Steden garnered the No. 3

spot on the all-conference team. The USC senior, who
was ranked as high as third nationally this season, was
upset yesterday in the Trojans' 8-1 victory over Texas
A& M.
"Steden has a history of burning out," Brennar. t,uid.
"Traditionally, she does really well in the fall and
builds up her ranking. She's probably lost two of her
last three matches."
Arizona's Jill Smoller and Arizona State's Sheri
Norris earned the next two spots on the all-conference
roster, followed by Eldredge and Werdel, who tied for
sixth.
Kuhlman and Dena Levy were honored as the Pac-
West's top doubles team. Fendick and Eldredge fol
lowed the USC pair on the all-conference team. Smol
ler and Susie Russo were picked No. 3.
With all the pressure associated with the current
NCAA tournament here, Pac-West honors might seem
insignificant. However, as Brennan said, "The players
may downplay the awards, but if you ever leave them
off the all-conference team, they'll come screaming."
