Shultz advocates covert reprisals
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz said last night
that the use of covert measures to combat terrorism has become
"imperative" and pledged the Administration to use such means
"legally, properly and with the due involvement" of congressional over
sight committees.
"What is cnicial is the ability to take some initiatives quietly, in situa
tions where the more the measures are known, the less effective will be
their results," the secretary said in remarks prepared for the American
Jewish Committee here in which he also appealed for more allied
cooperation in the war against terrorism.
"We have to get over the idea that 'covert' is a dirty word," Shultz
said, a theme he has emphasized with increasing frequency in the past
few months. Some U.S. officials suggested that Shultz may be preparing
the public for the future use of covert measures to strike agaiast known
terrorists and their bases.
Shultz told his audience that Western nations, working in closer
cooperation, now hold "the winning hand" in their battle against ter
rorism. "We have to keep this momentum going," he said.
The secretary acknowledged that last month's air strike against Libya,
which resulted in the death of Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy's
adopted daughter and other civilians, generated criticism and "less
public consensus" than the Administration would have liked. But he said
the results are now "convincing the skeptics."
"Khadafy is in retreat and Syria is uneasy," he said, adding that he
hoped the Syrian unease "may induce that country to think hard about
involvement in murderous adventures."
Soviets introduce draft arms treaty
WASHINGTON — The Soviet delegation to the Geneva arms talks
yesterday introduced a draft treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, but officials in Washington said the
document appears not to go beyond proposals announced Jan. 15 by So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
"It appears at first glance to be a more formal codification of previous
Soviet statements," White House spokesman Larry Speakes said yester
day, "but we will certainly analyze the proposal to see whether this con
stitutes constructive movement toward seeking common ground."
Some U.S. officials, recalling that Soviet negotiators did little more
than read Gorbachev's Jan. 15 speech into the record during the last
round of the Geneva talks, said yesterday's action could be considered a
step forward.
In that January speech, Gorbachev proposed eliminating all
European-bound Soviet SS-20 and U.S. Pershing II and ground-launched
cruise missiles over the next five to eight years.
He linked the reductions to U.S. agreement not to transfer those sys
tems, or longer-range Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missiles, to
the British or the French. Gorbachev also called for a pledge from those
countries not to build up their own systems, but rather freeze them at
current levels.
Verification of such an agreement, the Soviet leader said, would in
clude not only the traditional spy satellites maintained by both sides but
also on-site monitoring of the destruction of missiles.
Reagan Administration officials criticized the Gorbachev approach on
the grounds that it allegedly excludes Soviet SS-20s based in the Far
East. The U.S. officials also said the Soviets would have to deal directly
with the British and the French with regard to their nuclear systems.
Jihad terrorist threatens captives
BEI RUT, Lebanon — A caller claiming to represent the Islamic Jihad
terrorist organization warned yesterday that U.S. and French captives
held by the group would be harmed if Western or Arab governments
pressure Syria to obtain their release.
The message, which could not be authenticated, also said that some of
the captives had been "liquidated," but it gave no details.
Although expressing "respect and appreciation" for Syrian President
Hafez Assad, the message, the first attributed to Islamic Jihad since
March 13, also appeared to be a warning to Damascus not to take drastic
action against Moslem fundamentalists suspected of holding the
captives.
"We know of pressures by several countries including two Arab states
on President Assad," the statement, read over the telephone to an inter
national news agency, said. "We warn all these countries, whether
America, France or any other Arab country involved in these pressures
that we will make the earth shake under their feet because we will resort
to our destructive methods if they don't stop the maneuvers against Syria
and Islamic Jihad."
A message said to be from Islamic Jihad was delivered to the British
owned television news agency Visnews on March 13 with a videotape of
three of the French captives. That message said that all future com
muniques from Islamic Jihad would be typed and accompanied by
photographs or other evidence to avoid confusion over false claims.
There was nothing delivered with yesterday's call and noway to verify
its authenticity.
Belgian convicted in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A Belgian woman was con
victed of high treason by a South African court yesterday for assisting
African National Congress guerrillas in their fight against minority white
rule here.
Helene Passtoors, 44 , the first foreigner convicted of treason in a
South African court since the Anglo-Boer War more than 80 years ago,
now faces a possible death sentence for what she described as "a general
human duty to fight against racism and fascism."
Although denying that she was a "card-carrying" member of the
African National Congress, Passtoors admitted that she sympathized
with the aims of the outlawed group for "a democratic, just and nonra
cial South Africa" and had cooperated with members of the organization
both before and after coming here 15 months ago. She had nevertheless
pleaded innocent to the charges of treason and terrorism.
Justice Tjibbe Spoelstra, in convicting Passtoors of treason, ruled that
even the six-month student visa she held to study linguistics here meant
that "she owed allegiance to the republic (of South Africa) and could
commit treason against it," although she had been here only four months
before her arrest last June and is a Belgian citizen.
"Racism and fascism ... are totally unacceptable to any more person
in the world." Passtoors told the court following her conviction. "It's
likely slavery."
Spoelstra said the prosecution had failed to prove that Passtoors,
mother of four children and now a grandmother as well, had actually
belonged to the African National Congress, membership of which is of
ten taken by courts here as tantamount to treason, but found it was an
"inescapable inference" that she worked for the organization and its
military wing. Nevertheless, he acquitted her of terrorism charges,
saying this evidence against her might have been "totally concocted."
Israelis confirm arms-sale arrests
JERUSALEM — Two Israelis have been arrested in New York on
charges of conspiring to sell U.S.-made missiles illegally to Iran or Iraq,
according to Israeli and U.S. officials, in the second such case to unfold
in less than a month.
The Israeli government said yesterday that it had no connection with
Zeev Reiss, a reserve Israeli army lieutenant colonel and former profes
sional basketball star here, and another Israeli identified by a U.S. Cus
toms official as Gil Silva. No further information about Silva was imme
diately available.

cial South Africa" and had cooperated with members of the organization
both before and after coming here 15 months ago. She had nevertheless
pleaded innocent to the charges of treason and terrorism.
Justice Tjibbe Spoelstra, in convicting Passtoors of treason, ruled that
even the six-month student visa she held to study linguistics here meant
that "she owed allegiance to the republic (of South Africa) and could
commit treason against it," although she had been here only four months
before her arrest last June and is a Belgian citizen.
"Racism and fascism ... are totally unacceptable to any more person
in the world." Passtoors told the court following her conviction. "It's
likely slavery."
Spoelstra said the prosecution had failed to prove that Passtoors,
mother of four children and now a grandmother as well, had actually
belonged to the African National Congress, membership of which is of
ten taken by courts here as tantamount to treason, but found it was an
"inescapable inference" that she worked for the organization and its
military wing. Nevertheless, he acquitted her of terrorism charges,
saying this evidence against her might have been "totally concocted."
Israelis confirm arms-sale arrests
JERUSALEM — Two Israelis have been arrested in New York on
charges of conspiring to sell U.S.-made missiles illegally to Iran or Iraq,
according to Israeli and U.S. officials, in the second such case to unfold
in less than a month.
The Israeli government said yesterday that it had no connection with
Zeev Reiss, a reserve Israeli army lieutenant colonel and former profes
sional basketball star here, and another Israeli identified by a U.S. Cus
toms official as Gil Silva. No further information about Silva was imme
diately available.
Shultz advocates covert reprisals
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz said last night
that the use of covert measures to combat terrorism has become
"imperative" and pledged the Administration to use such means
"legally, properly and with the due involvement" of congressional over
sight committees.
"What is cnicial is the ability to take some initiatives quietly, in situa
tions where the more the measures are known, the less effective will be
their results," the secretary said in remarks prepared for the American
Jewish Committee here in which he also appealed for more allied
cooperation in the war against terrorism.
"We have to get over the idea that 'covert' is a dirty word," Shultz
said, a theme he has emphasized with increasing frequency in the past
few months. Some U.S. officials suggested that Shultz may be preparing
the public for the future use of covert measures to strike agaiast known
terrorists and their bases.
Shultz told his audience that Western nations, working in closer
cooperation, now hold "the winning hand" in their battle against ter
rorism. "We have to keep this momentum going," he said.
The secretary acknowledged that last month's air strike against Libya,
which resulted in the death of Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy's
adopted daughter and other civilians, generated criticism and "less
public consensus" than the Administration would have liked. But he said
the results are now "convincing the skeptics."
"Khadafy is in retreat and Syria is uneasy," he said, adding that he
hoped the Syrian unease "may induce that country to think hard about
involvement in murderous adventures."
Soviets introduce draft arms treaty
WASHINGTON — The Soviet delegation to the Geneva arms talks
yesterday introduced a draft treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles, but officials in Washington said the
document appears not to go beyond proposals announced Jan. 15 by So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
"It appears at first glance to be a more formal codification of previous
Soviet statements," White House spokesman Larry Speakes said yester
day, "but we will certainly analyze the proposal to see whether this con
stitutes constructive movement toward seeking common ground."
Some U.S. officials, recalling that Soviet negotiators did little more
than read Gorbachev's Jan. 15 speech into the record during the last
round of the Geneva talks, said yesterday's action could be considered a
step forward.
In that January speech, Gorbachev proposed eliminating all
European-bound Soviet SS-20 and U.S. Pershing II and ground-launched
cruise missiles over the next five to eight years.
He linked the reductions to U.S. agreement not to transfer those sys
tems, or longer-range Trident II submarine-launched nuclear missiles, to
the British or the French. Gorbachev also called for a pledge from those
countries not to build up their own systems, but rather freeze them at
current levels.
Verification of such an agreement, the Soviet leader said, would in
clude not only the traditional spy satellites maintained by both sides but
also on-site monitoring of the destruction of missiles.
Reagan Administration officials criticized the Gorbachev approach on
the grounds that it allegedly excludes Soviet SS-20s based in the Far
East. The U.S. officials also said the Soviets would have to deal directly
with the British and the French with regard to their nuclear systems.
Jihad terrorist threatens captives
BEI RUT, Lebanon — A caller claiming to represent the Islamic Jihad
terrorist organization warned yesterday that U.S. and French captives
held by the group would be harmed if Western or Arab governments
pressure Syria to obtain their release.
The message, which could not be authenticated, also said that some of
the captives had been "liquidated," but it gave no details.
Although expressing "respect and appreciation" for Syrian President
Hafez Assad, the message, the first attributed to Islamic Jihad since
March 13, also appeared to be a warning to Damascus not to take drastic
action against Moslem fundamentalists suspected of holding the
captives.
"We know of pressures by several countries including two Arab states
on President Assad," the statement, read over the telephone to an inter
national news agency, said. "We warn all these countries, whether
America, France or any other Arab country involved in these pressures
that we will make the earth shake under their feet because we will resort
to our destructive methods if they don't stop the maneuvers against Syria
and Islamic Jihad."
A message said to be from Islamic Jihad was delivered to the British
owned television news agency Visnews on March 13 with a videotape of
three of the French captives. That message said that all future com
muniques from Islamic Jihad would be typed and accompanied by
photographs or other evidence to avoid confusion over false claims.
There was nothing delivered with yesterday's call and noway to verify
its authenticity.
Belgian convicted in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A Belgian woman was con
victed of high treason by a South African court yesterday for assisting
African National Congress guerrillas in their fight against minority white
rule here.
Helene Passtoors, 44 , the first foreigner convicted of treason in a
South African court since the Anglo-Boer War more than 80 years ago,
now faces a possible death sentence for what she described as "a general
human duty to fight against racism and fascism."
Although denying that she was a "card-carrying" member of the
African National Congress, Passtoors admitted that she sympathized
with the aims of the outlawed group for "a democratic, just and nonra
cial South Africa" and had cooperated with members of the organization
both before and after coming here 15 months ago. She had nevertheless
