# House approves budget slashing defense
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Democratic-controlled
House, brushing aside last-minute charges from
President Reagan that it is taking "unacceptable
risks with our national security," voted 245-179
yesterday to approve a fiscal 1987 budget that
would sharply cut the Administration's proposed
military spending for next year.
The vote was largely along party lines, with 17
Republicans supporting the Democratic budget
and 19 Democrats voting against it. The essentially
partisan vote sets the stage for what seems to be
emerging as an equally partisan fight over con
tinuation of the Administration's rearmament pro
gram.
Republican support for the measure also ap
peared to fall short of the bipartisan backing that
House Democratic leaders had been demanding for
enactment of tax increases. And, even before the
vote, House Speaker Thomas O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.)
reaffirmed his insistence that Reagan must

"embrace" tax increases before Democrats would
support them.
The nearly $ 1 trillion House budget follows the
general outlines of a bipartisan plan adopted last
month by the Republican-controlled Senate. But
the two versions ditfer in some key elements, which
could cause problems in a House-Senate confer
ence that may be called as early as next week to
resolve differences.
Both come within the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
deficit target of $144 billion for next year, both
would cut Reagan's defense spending request, scale
back his proposals for domestic spending retrench
ment and call for tax increases of about $7 billion
more than the president has indicated he is willing
to accept.
But the House would cut Reagan's $320 billion
defense request to $285 billion, with $3 billion held
back until the Pentagon accounts fully for current
spending. The Senate, meanwhile, would cut the
president's request to $301 billion. The House

level is about $2 billion below current spending au
thority for defense; the Senate would allow slightly
more than enough extra spending authority to
cover the costs of inflation next year.
While both houses basically would freeze domes
tic spending, they would achieve the savings in dif
ferent ways and the Senate savings would be some
what larger. The Senate proposes less than half the
domestic savings that Reagan seeks; the House
proposes about one-third. Generally, the House
would protect or marginally expand a variety of
poverty programs, especially those for children, the
elderly and unemployed workers.
The House earmarked tax increases for deficit
reduction, while the Senate used the extra revenue
to increase defense spending. Moreover, the
House, with a projected deficit of $137 billion, or
$7 billion below the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
ceiling, allowed itself leeway to drop the tax-hike
provisions if it feels the political need to do so.
