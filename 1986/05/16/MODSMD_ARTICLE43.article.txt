### 
MOSCOW — An American doctor
here to help treat victims of the Cher
nobyl nuclear power station accident
said yesterday that the death toll, now
nine, is certain to rise.
Dr. Robert Gale, of the University
of California Medical Center in Los
Angeles, said at a press conference
that the casualty figures "may change
substantially."
Gale, a leading expert on bone
marrow transplants, arrived here May
2, six days after the explosion at. the

power plant 80 miles north of Kiev,
and was joined within days by two
colleagues from the University of
California and one from Israel.
Since their arrival, they have been
closeted at a Moscow hospital,
working with a team of Soviet doctors
to save the lives of 35 victims._
Gale said yesterday that 19 bone
marrow operations had been per
formed so far, and that the other
patients either do not need the opera
tions or are suffering from irrever

sible damage to other organs. So far,
seven radiation patients have died, in
addition to two men killed by steam
and falling debris during the accident.
"We were predictably not success
ful in all cases," Gale said, "but 28
are still alive and, although we know
that additional deaths are un
avoidable, we hope most will
survive."
In a transplant, bone marrow from
a close relative, or someone else with
very similar tissue structure, is in

jected into a patient's veins. It then
replaces the marrow destroyed by ra
diation.
Gale appeared at the press confer
ence for Soviet and foreign jour
nalists with Dr. Andrei Vorobyov,
who is head of the Soviet team hand
ling the Chernboyl patients. All of the
28 now in serious condition are
hospitalized in Moscow. In all, a total
of 299 are in hospitals here and in
other cities being treated for lesser
degrees of radiation.
