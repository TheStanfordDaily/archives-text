Import quotas imposed
WASHINGTON — In the latest maneuver in
a potential trade war with Europe, President
Reagan yesterday imposed quotas on a variety of
European wine and food sold in the United
States but delayed their effect until European re
strictions on American grain exports to Portugal
begin to harm U.S. sales, perhaps early next year.
The action had been expected since Reagan
declared in March that European Common Mar
ket quotas on U.S. corn and soybean sales to Por
tugal and Spain, which joined the Common Mar
ket earlier this year, would be matched in kind.
The president's decision to suspend the impact of
the quotas on European wine and food until the
Portuguese quotas begin to hurt the United
States amounted to a partial relaxation of ten
sions.
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
and Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng
agreed in a meeting with European officials in
Paris last month to delay the impact of the U.S.
quotas. Negotiations with the Europeans are to
continue.
Speakes said that the United States would also
impose sanctions agaiast Common Market tariffs
on corn and sorghum sales to Spain, for which the
Administration is seeking compensation in the
form of lower Common Market tariffs on
manufactured goods. The Administration has set
a July 1 deadline for tariff retaliation in the
Spanish case, which Speakes said had already all
but extinguished American exports.
Report analyses teaching
WASHINGTON — America must drastically
overhaul the way it recruits, trains and pays its
classroom teachers if it is to cope with a shrinking
teacher pool and increased economic and tech
nological competition abroad, according to a
comprehensive report.
The report, by a task force of the Carnegie
Forum on Education and the Economy, lays out
an ambitious eight-point program for restructur
ing the teaching force, including elimination of

the undergraduate degree in education; a na
tional board to certify new teachers; creation of a
special group of experienced and better-paid
"lead teachers," and a merit-pay plan under
which schools receive bonuses based on how well
their students perform.
Past merit-pay proposals have focused on
rewarding individual teachers, not entire schools,
and have rarely been linked to student perfor
mance. Such plans have traditionally been
opposed by teachers' unions.
The report, "A Nation Prepared: Teachers for
the 21st Century," is due to be released today in
San Diego. The 14-member task force included
the presidents of the nation's two largest teacher
unions, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean (R),
former North Carolina Gov. James Hunt (D).
Ruling to boost AT&T
WASHINGTON — The Federal Communica
tions Commission, in a major ruling, voted yes
terday to remove current restrictions and help
clear the way for AT&T and the former Bell sys
tem companies to offer their customers an array
of new services from voice messages to home
burglar alarms.
By a unanimous decision, the commission
eliminated a controversial requirement that the
local Bell telephone companies establish separate
subsidiaries to offer new information services.
The telephone companies have complained
that separate subsidiaries were too costly to oper
ate and stymied innovation. With the commis
sion's ruling, the telephone companies would be
able to incorporate these technological advances
into their computerized telephone networks.
FCC Chairman Mark Fowler said that the
decision would "push out the frontiers of compe
tition in telecommunication in the United
States."
Fowler also predicted that consumers could ex
pect to see a "significant" decrease in their local
telephone rates as the companies spread their
operating costs over more services.
FCC officials and telephone industry execu
tives cautioned that few new services will be

available soon to consumers because of other re
strictions on these services included in the federal
decree that broke up AT&T two years ago. The
federal judge who oversees the decree would first
have to agree to the changes.
NASA request delayed
WASHINGTON — The space agency's re
quest for a new, $2.8 billion shuttle orbiter ran
into unexpected resistance yesterday as White
House chief of staff Donald Regan questioned
whether the Administration should spend more
on existing technology or seek a new generation
of space vehicles, administration sources said.
During a meeting with President Reagan and
top national security advisers marked by what
one official called "heated debate," Regan
repeatedly asked pointed questions about the
need for a new shuttle orbiter, suggesting that it
might be outdated by the next decade.
The Administration officials said the president
was told that there is "great uncertainty" about
the future demands for launching civilian and
military satellites and about the frequency of
shuttle flights in the wake of the Jan. 28 Chal
lenger disaster. Reagan made no decision at yes
terday's meeting, officials said.
Sources said the president was given presenta
tions yesterday by the Office of Management and
Budget, the Defense Department and the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration on
the need for a shuttle orbiter to replace Chal
lenger and for new unmanned rockets to carry ci
vilian and military satellites.
Stocks sharply lower
NEW YORK — Stock prices fell sharply yes
terday in selling attributed to rising open-market
interest rates and uncertainty over the progress
of the economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
tumbled 33.60 to 1,774.68, for its seventh largest
point loss ever and its biggest since it took a
record 41.91-point drop on April 30.
