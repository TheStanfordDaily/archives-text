Oil liability tightened
SACRAMENTO — Coastal property owners
whose land is harmed by offshore oil spills could
collect damages from any drilling company
within 10 miles of the polluted property — even
if the firm didn't cause the spill — under a plan
approved yesterday by the Assembly.
The measure, backed by environmentalists and
California's powerful lawyers' lobby, would
define offshore oil and natural gas drilling as
"ultrahazardous," and declare that a company is
"absolutely liable without regard to fault" for
leaks that damage property closer than 10 miles
to the drill site.
If there is more than one company within the
10-mile zone, the companies could all share the
liability and be forced to pay losses, under the
bill, A 84044, by Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-
Carmel). Farr's measure was approved 43-26
and sen to the Senate.
Republicans — except two representing coas
tal districts— opposed Farr's measure, but Dem
ocrats said the bill was needed to protect coastal
homeowners.
" The bottom line here is if you're a property
owner on the coast, and you suffer damage .. .
you shouldn t be responsible for cleaning up the
mess," said Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-
Sacramento). "This spreads the liability out
among all the companies" within the 10-mile
area, he added.

AIDS virus in animals
LOS ANGELES — California researchers
have sucessfully grown the virus which causes
AIDS in animal cells for the first time, a develop
ment they say could lead to finding ways to in
hibit reproduction of the deadly germ.
The virus has been grown previously only in
cells of the human immune system, the ones it at
tacks and kills during the course of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, San
Francisco, and the Chiron Corp., of Emeryville,
Calif., said they found a way to grow the virus in
non-immune cells from monkeys, minks, mice
and humans.
The virus reproduced poorly in these cells, es
pecially mouse cells, a fact that could be very use
ful in future research, said Dr. Jay Levy, principal
investigator of the study at the university.
The poor reproduction means that either the
animal cells lack something that more susceptible
human cells have, or that human cells lack an in
hibitor to the virus that the others possess. Levy
said.
Cardinal praises Aquino
LOS ANGELES — The Philippines' top reli
gious leader said yesterday he believes President
Corazon Aquino can persuade communist rebels

to lay down their arms and, with America's help,
rebuild her country's crumbling economy.
Cardinal Jaime Sin also said during a news
conference that former President Ferdinand
Marcos should remain in self-imposed exile in
Hawaii because he would not be safe in the
Philippines.
"It would not be prudent for him to return be
cause there are people who are very angry. . . .
These people were released (from imprisonment
on political charges) by Cory and these people
would not be happy for him to return," Sin said,
referring to the new president by her nickname.
Sin said he feels Aquino's appeals to commu
nist unsurgents to lay down their arms are
working.
Many of the rebels, he said, are citizens
"disgruntled" at Marcos' authoritarian rule
rather than dedicated communists.
Sin, who led the church in support for the cam
paign of Aquino, said she is an ideal leader for
the country now, both because she lacks political
ambition and because of her personality.
