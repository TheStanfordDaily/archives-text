# Divestment act will occur soon

Divestment of Stanford's $9,900 of
shares in Newmont Mining,
mandated by a vote of the University
Board of Trustees on Tuesday, will
take place as soon as the controller of
a trust containing the shares can be
notified to give his approval, a Uni
versity official said yesterday.
According to University Treasurer
Rodney Adams, the Newmont shares
are part of an unusual "life income
trust" administered in part by a non-
University "co-trustee." Permission
from the outside trustee must be ob
tained before any shares can be sold.
Adams said that the fund's trustee,
who has been traveling for several
days, has arranged to contact him by
"early next week" to get news of the
board's divestment decision. The
trustee, whom Adams declined to
name, is expected to approve the
board's request to divest from New
mont.
"Based on a preliminary talk with
him ... I have every expectation that
he would immediately call a broker
and sell (the stock)," Adams said.
Following a recommendation from
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-1R), the trustees
voted to sell Stanford's Newmont

holdings, the University's first divest
ment of South Africa-related stock.
The board also voted to divest its
nearly $400,000 in Diamond Sham
rock Petroleum stock in October if
the company does not follow through
with its announcement to disinvest its
interests in South Africa by that time.
In addition, the trustees asked their
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility (SCIR) to gather fur
ther information on the South
African conduct of the French-based
Schlumberger corporation. Stanford's
Schlumberger holdings are valued at
nearly $3.5 million.
Both Schlumberger and Diamond
Shamrock will be notified of the
board's decisions within "the next
few days," according to William
Massy, University vice president for
Business and Finance.
Although the trustees "did not set
a specific date" for deciding whether
to divest from Schlumberger, a re
evaluation of the corporation's con
duct is likely to occur at the first trus
tee meeting next fall. Massy said.
In order to gather the additional in
formation on Schlumberger's conduct
in South Africa requested by the trus
tees, Massy said that he and Adams
intend to speak with Schlumberger
managers and board members during
the next few months. The standards

used to evaluate Schlumberger will be
"roughly similar to the Sullivan prin
ciples," Massy said.
The Sullivan Principles, established
in 1977 by the Rev. Leon Sullivan,
set a code of conduct for corporations
doing business in South Africa aimed
at fighting discrimination.
Massy cautioned, however, that
since Schlumberger is a foreign cor
poration, it should not be judged by
the same standards as U.S. corpora
tions.
"(Foreign corporations) are back
where we were in 1977-79" in readi
ness to take steps against apartheid.
Massy said.
"We'll be keeping an eye on
Schlumberger, and so will the trus
tees," C-IR Chairman Richard
Brody, professor of political science,
said yesterday. Prior to the trustee
meeting this week, the C-IR recom
mended that the board divest from
Schlumberger and Diamond Sham
rock, as well as Newmont. "If the
trustees don't do anything on
Schlumberger, we'll (make) the same
recommendation again," Brody said.
The C-IR, established nine years
ago, advises the vice president of
Business and Finance and the trustees
on investment policy. The commis
sion consists of faculty, student,
alumni and staff representatives.
Brody said that by deciding time
this week for the first time to divest
from a corporation doing business in
South Africa, the trustees may have
helped clear the way for similar deci
sions in the future. The standards by
which corporate conduct is deemed
unacceptable "become more readily
accepted each time around," Brody
said.
