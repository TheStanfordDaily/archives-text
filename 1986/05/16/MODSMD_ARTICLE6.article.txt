# 15-cent call era is over
## Students must pay bill 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Students at Stanford's overseas campus in Tours,
France, fall and winter quarter thought it was too
good to be true when they discovered the house
phone would permit a call anywhere in the world
for 15 cents.
They were right.
Stanford-in-Tours administrators in January fi
nally received a bill for $16,000 from the French
phone company that had monitored the calls be
tween Nov. 28, when the pay phone was installed,
and Jan. 29. University officials last week informed
students that failure to pay will result in a hold on
diplomas and commitments to register.
In a May 5 letter to the 53 students who were reg
istered fall or winter quarter, Overseas Studies
Deputy Director Nancy Padgett stated the bill —
eventually reduced by the phone company to
$9,995 — amounts to $ 188 per person.
The students in question vented their frustration
last night at a meeting with Padgett where they
questioned the legality of the University's move and
discussed alternate methods of payment.
"I feel that I'm paying for the phone company's
incompetency," junior Cecil Leighton said. "The
matter wouldn't have arisen if (the phone) had been
working correctly."
Padgett, in her letter, quoted the Overseas
Studies contract signed by students prior to
departure from the University: " 'Charges (for loss
or damage to University property) will be pro-rated
among the students studying at the center during
the quarter in which the loss or damage occurred if
no specific responsibility can be determined.' "
The telephone is considered Stanford property
because it was leased to the overseas campus,
Padgett said, adding that according to French law
all the students are responsible because they did not
report the malfunction.
Students last night argued against the Univer
sity's decision to charge each individual an equal
amount. Many complained that the phone had been
used by French students who socialized in the Stan
ford villa. Others said that the arrangement unfairly
penalized students who had not used the phone.
"I know some students didn't use (the phone),"
said one student, "while others made four-hour
evening calls to loved ones."
One student suggested not paying at all — "it
wouldn't be worth their while to sue" — while
