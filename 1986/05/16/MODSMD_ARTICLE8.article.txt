## Treasure Market â€™86 set for tonight 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
When Stanford has a garage
sale, the merchandise isn't
just hand-me-downs and old
hubcaps.
This weekend's Treasure Mar
ket '86, benefitting the Stanford
Museum of Art, features over
16,000 items, including books,
furs, furniture, china, silver, ethnic
art and country kitchen wares, ac
cording to Mary Lyn Moseley,
publicist for the event.
In fact, the sale is so large that it
must be held in Maples Pavilion.
"We have everything. We have
the spectrum,'" Moseley said.
Organized by the Stanford
Committee for Art, the event
places $500,000 in merchandise
up for sale.
All items are donated by com
munity members, and the money
raised will go to the museum's ac
quisition fund. "We won't be using
the money for buildings," she said.

"Prices range from $ 1 for a glass
to $6,000 for a platinum watch,''
Moseley added.
The event is ideal for those who
want to add a little nostalgia to
their dorm rooms. A magazine kit
from the 1930s and a case of
Coca-Cola are just two examples
of collectibles in the country
kitchen section.
"We expect it to be fabulously
successful," she said.
The sale has been held every
two years since the late 19505,
raising over $1 million over the
last 28 years.
The 1984 event netted more
than $300,000 for the museum,
and organizers hope to surpass
that amount this year.
The gala opening begins tonight
at 7 p.m. and goes until 10 p.m.
Tickets are $30 and can be bought
at the door. The more expensive
items will be auctioned off tonight.
The event continues tomorrow
and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., and students are admitted
free of charge with Stanford I.D.
