# PAC formed to support Israel ties
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford students have estab
lished a political action group on
campus to support political candi
dates who favor a strong U.S.-Israel
relationship.
The co-directors of the Student
Activism Network (STANPAC) are
juniors Michael Bunzel and Mike
Tuchin. The group, formed this
spring, is currently 50 students
strong.
Bunzel said he plans to register
STANPAC with the Federal Elec
tions Committee as an official politi
cal action committee, making STAN
PAC one of the first college political
groups ever to gain formal status as a
"PAC."
Before he can do that, however,
the group must raise $ 1,000, a goal

Bunzel hopes to reach by the June 3
California primaries. STANPAC
charges its members $5 annual dues
but hopes to raise most of its money
through community donations.
STANPAC members are "trying to
gain access to any future political
leader, state and local, by starting at
the grass-roots level," according to
Bunzel. "Now is the time to gain
access. The people politicians re
member are the people who helped to
get them elected."
Members of the group are cur
rently focusing their efforts on,
though not limiting themselves to, the
campaign race for the 12th Congres
sional District, which includes Stan
ford. STANPAC is working on the
campaigns of three Republican candi
dates — Tom Skornia, Ernie Konnyu
and John Mercer — for the tradition
ally Republican district.

STANPAC plans to work on both
Democratic and Republican U.S.
Senate campaigns. The Democratic
incumbent, Alan Cranston, may face
off against current 12th Congres
sional District Rep. Ed Zschau, and
STANPAC is hopeful that the two
will agree to a debate at Stanford if
Zschau wins the Republican primary.
Bunzel calls STANPAC a
"bipartisan, multi-religion, multi
ethnic political action committee."
The group will raise awareness of
local politics and community issues
and encourage public service by in
creasing student participation in cam
paigns, he said.
The group's focus on U.S.-Israel
relations is "unifying," according to
Bunzel, because a political action
group "must be single-issue to be ef
fective."
STANPAC is co-sponsoring a

major political forum at noon Tues
day in White Plaza that will feature
speeches by several candidates, Dem
ocratic and Republican, for the 12th
Congressional District seat. Students
will have the chance at the event to
join STANPAC, Bunzel said.
The other sponsors are the Stan
ford Republicans and Stanford-in-
Government. The event will be "a
completely bipartisan affair," Bunzel
said.
Bunzel said the inspiration for
STANPAC came from a student
group at the University of Michigan
that helped torpedo the 1984 re
election bid of Illinois Sen. Charles
Percy.
Percy, the Republican incumbent,
drew criticism for his views on the
Middle East, most notably for calling
Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat a "moderate."
