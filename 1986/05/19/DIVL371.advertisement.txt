EDUCATION or MISEDUCATION?
A Campuswide Forum on the Western Culture Program
Stanford University declares the study of Western Culture to be an
essential step toward becoming an educated person. In 1980 the
University implemented the program on the premise that it
introduces the "major works and historical movements that have
shaped Western Civilization."
The Western Culture Program faces constant opposition from
students and faculty who are concerned that the program omits
the experiences of women and non-Europeans and the
contributions they have made in shaping Western Society.
••
Presently, the BSU along with other students and faculty
members has expressed a need for the current program to be
changed.
This forum will provide an opportunity for various viewpoints to

current status, and the future of the Western Culture curriculum.
There will also be an open forum for audience participation.
