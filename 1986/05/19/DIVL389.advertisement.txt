Attn. Daily Staffers
Here's the deal:
Today at noon: Staff lunch with
James Lyons, Diana Conklin and
Joe Pisano. Bring questions. There
is such a thing as a free lunch.
Tomorrow at noon: Grill session
with the four editorial candidates.
Bring tough questions. Like,
where's the drinking fountain? And
why does the editor's office smell
like a dead rat?
Friday at five: Meet at The Daily
for a happy hour before the
Volume 189 banquet at the Char
thouse in Half Moon Bay. Come
buzzed.
