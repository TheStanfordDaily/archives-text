The car. If there was anything that threw me over
the edge, it was that blue and white 1969 Mustang
convertible, long and low to the ground, with a
throaty, thrilling roar just as heart-stoppingly mascu

I knew from the moment I stepped into that trem
bling metal love machine that I would never be the
same again. He knew too. There was a small, private
smirk on his face when he pulled open the door and
swept the Tanqueray bottles off the seat. "Slide in,"
he said over his shoulder. "Watch out for the beer on
the floor."
I'm sure it was no accident that the car started
coughing and jerking after we had exited 280. I felt
my heart begin to speed up as he coasted down a hill
into a dirt parking lot by the railroad tracks and
stopped.
"Suck!" he said. "I can't believe this. We're never
going to get to the batting cages."
