# Students receive a Golden opportunity
## 
### MARCUS MABRY Staff writer 
Eleven undergraduates have been
awarded the first Robert M. Golden
Grants for Humanities Scholarship
and Artistic Creation.
The recipients will receive funds to
carry on research projects or stipends
that will free them from summer em
ployment so they can conduct re
search. The recipients' projects range
from architectural analysis to writing.
Some have a creative emphasis, some
are scholastic in nature.
The winners were chosen from an
applicant pool of 27, according to
Laura Selznick, director of Un
dergraduate Research Opportunities.
Applicants submitted proposals for
an advanced individual research proj
ect. Grants were awarded on the basis
of the feasibility of the project pro
posed, the students' academic record
and their qualifications for undertak
ing the project, according to Carolyn
Lougee, dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
The purpose of the Golden Grants
is to encourage undergraduates to
pursue interests in the areas of the
creative arts and humanities. They
are designed to act as incentives to
students in the humanities much in
the same way that Firestone Scholar

ships provide research funds for so
cial scientists and engineers, accord
ing to Selznick.
Lougee said competition for the
awards was stiff. "There were more
than 1 1 really excellent proposals
that we would have liked to fund,"
she said.

Each proposal was first reviewed
by a faculty memberwithin the appli
cant's department, who later became
sponsor of the project. The applica
tion was then submitted to Selznick

and grouped with the applications
from its discipline, then ranked and
commented upon by the department
chairs. There was an interim screen
ing by department members in addi
tion to the final screening by a
six-member faculty committee
composed of Lougee and members
from various humanities and art de
partments, according to Selznick.
Selznick said the grants will al
low students to spend time on re
search that they would not be able to
do if they did not have the funding.
Recipients echoed Selznick's remark.
Geoff Sanborn, a junior majoring
in English with a creative writing em
phasis, was awarded a grant for a
project entitled "Novella." He said
the idea of writing a work such as this
had been on his mind for a while, and
the grant served as an incentive.
"If it wasn't for the grant, I'd have
to be out pounding the pavement for
work," Sanborn said.
He plans a career in print jour
nalism after graduating from Stan
ford. He also plans to continue crea
tive writing.
Josefine Nauckhoff, a junior
majoring in philosophy, was awarded
the grant for her project, "Kant's
'Free Play of The Imagination' in
Aesthetic Experience: Key to a Uni
versal Ethic?"

"The grant motivated me to do
what I was already intending to do,"
Nauckhoff said. "I was shocked when
I won it. I was not expecting it at all."
She said she hopes more students
will take advantage of the grants in
the future. "More people should ap
ply for them. All you need is a con
ceptual framework for your project."
Nauckhoff plans to continue study
ing philosophy in graduate school
after finishing at Stanford.
Kevin Owens is a junior with a self
designed major called design synthe
sis. His project is "The Chantry
House, Henley-on-Thames, Ox
fordshire." His grant will pay for
travel expenses to Great Britain,
photographic and graphics equipment
and living expenses. "If it were not
for this, 1 wouldn't be able to do it,"
he said.
He plans to either attend graduate
school for architecture or to work for
a creative organization such as Dis
ney Productions. He also said he feels
more undergraduates should apply to
the program.
"It's definitely worth applying for.
It's a great opportunity."
Other recipients include Stephanie
Alexander, Brigid Doherty, Theresa
McCarthy, Mace Perlman. Mary
Poindexter, Nicholas Schiff, Andrea
Shields and Regina Tan.

The purpose of
the Golden
Grants is to en
courage under
graduates to
pursue interests in
the areas of the
creative arts and
humanities.
