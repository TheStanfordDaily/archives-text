## An Independent Newspaper Patience is unjustifiable 
### 
Last week the Stanford Board of Trustees took a
petty step against apartheid by divesting $9,900 from
one company, threatening to divest from another and
calling for a review of our selective divestment policy
in 1987. We wonder if this is a step forward or back
ward, considering the historic inertia on the part of the
trustees and the historic activism on the part of the stu
dents.
The trustees and the Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility have done little to demonstrate their stated
abhorrence of apartheid. For the past decade the C-IR
has been subjectively nit-picking in individual corpor
ate minutiae without ever giving clear criteria for di
vestment. Their intention to ever significantly divest
under any circumstances is very questionable.
The threat to divest must be made credible. This en
tails setting a deadline for all investments in South
Africa as the recent student referendum demands. The
claim that companies are helping the blacks of South
Africa ignores the fact that many of the these companies
have operated there for decades; some companies, like
Ford Motor Company, have been there since the

1800s. Foreign investment in South Africa is support
ing, not opposing, apartheid â€” especially in the vital
electronic, automotive and energy industries.
It is naive to believe that apartheid will be dis
mantled without pressure applied on the entities in
volved. The Stanford trustees must be pressured;
foreign companies must be pressured; foreign govern
ments must be pressured; and ultimately, the racist
regime in South Africa must be pressured to abolish,
not reform, apartheid. Without making an immediate
commitment for total divestment, the trustees are not
playing their part.
The tragedy of the trustees' position is that their pa
tience with apartheid is totally unjustified. Can we ex
pect it to be understood by Dennis Brutus who was im
prisoned on Robinson Island, by Winnie Mandellawho
was dragged from her house by South African police,
by the people of Kwandebele who were forced into an
"independent" homeland status last week, or by the
families of the 200 children who were killed by the
South African police in the past two years? The victims
of apartheid will not understand our patience.
