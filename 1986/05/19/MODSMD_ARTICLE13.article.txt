## Theme houses are useful 
### 
Lily Chang's "Ethnic housing hampers diversity" view
point (Daily, May 13), while expressing noble intentions,
exhibits some double standards, expresses common
misunderstandings of those who have never lived in a
theme house, and expects far too much of all Stanford stu
dents.
Chang feels minority students have no right "to return
to a living situation where the atmosphere is congenial
and sympathetic" after spending a hard day going to
classes and working. Apparently, we cannot spend the
evening studying in the library, eating dinner or hanging
out with friends and people with whom we feel comforta
ble. Chang feels it is our responsibility to actively contrib
ute to the diversity of Stanford 24 hours a day. I suggest a
double standard is being applied if non-minority students

are not likewise expected to act. If there is no double stan
dard, then it is unrealistic to expect minority students to
spend a major part of their lives dispelling myths about
their group, just as it would be unfair to expect a fraternity
member, a Columbae resident, a Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS) member or any member of a
stereotyped group to do the same. In other words, if I like
to spend part of my days relaxing in my room listening to
my kind of music and hanging out with my kind of people,
then I have a right to do so whether I live in an ethnic
theme house or a mainstream dorm.
Chang is probably not alone in feeling that single
handedly one minority student can dispel myths and
destroy stereotypes. A minority student who pretends to
speak for an entire community or have adequate knowl
edge of all its stereotypes and realities does a great dis
service to himself and the Stanford community. They hurt
themselves by ignoring the diversity within their own eth
nic community. There are many horizons to be broadened
even within one's own community. Chang's belief that she
would not have learned anything from other Asian-
Americans in Okada is unfounded. A student who does
not bother to interact with others of his own ethnicity may
never realize that we may not, in fact, be dealing with
similar backgrounds and viewpoints. A fellow East Los
Angeles Chicano once told me that because he had grown
up around Mexicans all his life and had learned all about
them he needed to know, he did not feel it necessary to
mix with the Latino community at Stanford. This is simply
not the case: the Chicano from East L.A. does not have

the same background and viewpoints as the son of a
Hispanic doctor who attended Phillips Exeter Academy.
The student also does a great disservice to the Stanford
community by presenting an incomplete picture of an
entire ethnic community. One person cannot represent
the viewpoints or exhibit the characteristics of all blacks in
the United States. This would be akin to my accepting the
views and background of one white student I met two
years ago in my freshman dorm as typical of the views and
backgrounds of all white students at Stanford. Chang's al
ternative of eliminating theme houses and insuring every
dorm had a token one or two minority students would be a
weak and futile attempt to create diversity in Stanford's
Residential Educational program. Consult Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson for Stanford's official po
sition on this.
It is unclear what Chang knows about the ethnic make
up of a theme house resident population, but it is clear
that it is a common mistake to believe that most of the res
idents of a theme house are of that particular ethnicity. It
is almost as silly as thinking that Zapata house residents
eat Mexican food every day and conduct house meetings
in Spanish.
Finally, Chang attempts to draw an analogy between
GLAS at Stanford and minority non-housed organiza
tions on campus. The analogy is simply not valid, as the
issue of homosexuality and its place in our society crosses
lines of class, race, ethnicity and socio-economic back
ground to discuss a particular set of questions. Ethnic
minority issues, however, deal with those very questions
of class, race, sexism, ethnicity, socio-economic back
grounds and political inequalities that have existed since
the inception of this country, and have roots not only in
Western culture, but in other world cultures. Since the is
sues are different, the manner in which awareness of them
is created and promoted is different.
In other respects, the analogy may be valid, but the con
clusion remains incorrect. If Chang believes theme houses
should be eliminated, then using her reasoning, fraterni
ties should also be axed. If it is wrong for several minority
students to choose to live together somewhere, then it
must be wrong for several gay individuals to live in an off
campus apartment, several women to choose to live in
Roth or several white students to draw into the suites.

Lily Chang's "Ethnic housing hampers diversity" view
point (Daily, May 13), while expressing noble intentions,
exhibits some double standards, expresses common
misunderstandings of those who have never lived in a
theme house, and expects far too much of all Stanford stu
dents.
Chang feels minority students have no right "to return
to a living situation where the atmosphere is congenial
and sympathetic" after spending a hard day going to
classes and working. Apparently, we cannot spend the
evening studying in the library, eating dinner or hanging
out with friends and people with whom we feel comforta
ble. Chang feels it is our responsibility to actively contrib
ute to the diversity of Stanford 24 hours a day. I suggest a
double standard is being applied if non-minority students

are not likewise expected to act. If there is no double stan
dard, then it is unrealistic to expect minority students to
spend a major part of their lives dispelling myths about
their group, just as it would be unfair to expect a fraternity
member, a Columbae resident, a Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS) member or any member of a
stereotyped group to do the same. In other words, if I like
to spend part of my days relaxing in my room listening to
my kind of music and hanging out with my kind of people,
then I have a right to do so whether I live in an ethnic
theme house or a mainstream dorm.
Chang is probably not alone in feeling that single
handedly one minority student can dispel myths and
destroy stereotypes. A minority student who pretends to
speak for an entire community or have adequate knowl
edge of all its stereotypes and realities does a great dis
service to himself and the Stanford community. They hurt
themselves by ignoring the diversity within their own eth
nic community. There are many horizons to be broadened
even within one's own community. Chang's belief that she
would not have learned anything from other Asian-
Americans in Okada is unfounded. A student who does
not bother to interact with others of his own ethnicity may
never realize that we may not, in fact, be dealing with
similar backgrounds and viewpoints. A fellow East Los
Angeles Chicano once told me that because he had grown
up around Mexicans all his life and had learned all about
them he needed to know, he did not feel it necessary to
mix with the Latino community at Stanford. This is simply
not the case: the Chicano from East L.A. does not have

the same background and viewpoints as the son of a
Hispanic doctor who attended Phillips Exeter Academy.
The student also does a great disservice to the Stanford
community by presenting an incomplete picture of an
entire ethnic community. One person cannot represent
the viewpoints or exhibit the characteristics of all blacks in
the United States. This would be akin to my accepting the
views and background of one white student I met two
years ago in my freshman dorm as typical of the views and
backgrounds of all white students at Stanford. Chang's al
ternative of eliminating theme houses and insuring every
dorm had a token one or two minority students would be a
weak and futile attempt to create diversity in Stanford's
Residential Educational program. Consult Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson for Stanford's official po
sition on this.
It is unclear what Chang knows about the ethnic make
up of a theme house resident population, but it is clear
that it is a common mistake to believe that most of the res
idents of a theme house are of that particular ethnicity. It
is almost as silly as thinking that Zapata house residents
eat Mexican food every day and conduct house meetings
in Spanish.
Finally, Chang attempts to draw an analogy between
GLAS at Stanford and minority non-housed organiza
tions on campus. The analogy is simply not valid, as the
issue of homosexuality and its place in our society crosses
lines of class, race, ethnicity and socio-economic back
ground to discuss a particular set of questions. Ethnic
minority issues, however, deal with those very questions
of class, race, sexism, ethnicity, socio-economic back
grounds and political inequalities that have existed since
the inception of this country, and have roots not only in
Western culture, but in other world cultures. Since the is
sues are different, the manner in which awareness of them
is created and promoted is different.
In other respects, the analogy may be valid, but the con
clusion remains incorrect. If Chang believes theme houses
should be eliminated, then using her reasoning, fraterni
ties should also be axed. If it is wrong for several minority
students to choose to live together somewhere, then it
must be wrong for several gay individuals to live in an off
campus apartment, several women to choose to live in
Roth or several white students to draw into the suites.
