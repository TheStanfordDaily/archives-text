# What Stanford teaches us
## 
### 
As I pore over the pages of the latest Newsweek maga
zine in search of some world event about which I might
have a passably valuable thought, it occurs to me that this
is My Last Column, and that I am therefore entitled to a
certain amount of latitude. Latitude, you understand,
translates as the wanton renunciation of logical structure,
clear writing style, analytical thought and all those lofty
ideals to which we columnists aspire (generally in vain). It
is mid-May, a time for frantic self-indulgence before early
June and finals catch us by the throat, and my little contri
bution to decadent irresponsibility is a few decidedly non
journalistic random thoughts and observations.

Barring some unforeseen and unhappy turn of events, I
and the vast majority of my fellow seniors will shortly be
given sheets of paper which officially designate us as Stan
ford University graduates. At that time, I expect to be in a
state of mind at least one step removed from what is com
monly termed reality (how else are we supposed to endure
roasting in Stanford Stadium to the tune of laugh-a
minute Ted Koppel's Commencement address?), and will
likely ■ffriwiliing and unable to carefully consider the
worth of the diploma for which I have expended so much
time and energy. In the interest of getting these little mat
ters out of the way and ensuring that I am untroubled by
anything so sobering as thought on Commencement Day,
here follows a capsule assessment of the Stanford educa
tion from one prospective graduate's point of view.
The worst thing I can say about my four years at Stan
ford is that they have been exhausting. I am still taken
aback when confronted with The Senior Year Question
("What are you going to do after graduation?") because it
strikes me as wholly unconscionable that I am not permit
ted to lapse into a coma for three months after June 15.
What am I going to do"! I thought I had already done
something. Stanford has been the setting and catalyst for
an enormous amount of personal growth, learning,
trauma, excitement, despair and stress for me, all
delivered at rapid fire in the short span of four years. It
has provided me with a host of poignant memories about
which I can already wax nostalgic, as well as with a num
ber of encounters with intolerance, insensitivity, bigotry
and outright stupidity among people who, as society's
most privileged members, ought to know better. The
shocking thing is that the madness is only beginning. As
Charles Schulz's canine philosopher Snoopy was once
fond of saying, it's a long way to Tipperary. My Stanford
education taught me that.
It took a while to sink in. In my freshman year, I did not
exist. Ask anyone who was there; I was not a human
being. I was instead a studying automaton, in the library at
7 p.m. and out by 11 p.m., having completed every task I

carefully set out to accomplish. I read all my Western Cul
ture books. At one point I was ahead by a week in my Poli
Sci 1 readings. The very thought of such earnest toil
makes me shudder today. Unquestionably I gained some
thing buried in Green Library — a love of learning and in
tellectual challenge, a sharpening of analytical skills. But I
can safely say that the well-oiled student-machine of my
freshman and part of my sophomore years was benefitting
from only a part of the Stanford education, and the least
important part at that.
The mistake I made during my non-human years was
not simply that I studied too much, or that I failed to un
derstand that a good portion of any education takes place
outside the confines of the library. Those were easily i
dentified errors, more or less easily rectified. My mistake
was that I studied too much without knowing why. Good
grades give me about as much personal satisfaction as a
balanced checkbook; they're tidy, secure and they look
good on a computer printout. They signify little unless
they are acquired for a purpose beyond themselves; they
are means, not ends. I wanted good grades because that
was what was required of me for success. Never mind
what success was; I knew vaguely that it was the thing
which one obtained if one took the most difficult classes
and got the best grades in high school, did likewise in col
lege, and again did likewise in graduate or professional
school. I was on the Success Track, a program for life that
had little to do with what I found personally gratifying and
everything to do with what was expected of me and what I
expected of myself as one of the fabled Best and Brightest
(the barely concealed arrogance here, by the way, is quite
collective; all Stanford students are supposed to be among
the Best and Brightest). I had fully accepted the form
rather than the content of education. It is not that the
process involved no thought. It is that higher education is
not aimed solely at gaining a mastery of facts, but at
beginning to gain a mastery of self. It is aimed at prodding
one to ask questions, to build the foundations of personal
independence and self-knowledge that give you the vision
and strength to find what you truly want and to pursue it
— despite the possibility that, more often than not, it is
not on any track at all.
I used to be one of those people you see buckled in and
whizzing by at unsafe speeds on the Track. It took excur
sions into the world of college theater and writing, and the
invaluable help of friends undergoing their own metamor
phoses to free me from that perilous lockstep mindset.
The world beyond graduation is not a series of tracks but a
vast, open sea; it is good that it should be so. Whether I
would have reached that same conclusion without higher
education I do not know. It hardly matters. I do know that
the self-knowledge, the attainment of personal freedom,
and the rebirth of a student-machine as a human being
measure the true worth of my Stanford education. I can
not imagine a more precious graduation gift.
