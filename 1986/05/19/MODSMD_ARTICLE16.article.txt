Referendum is a
vote for fairness
I just don't buy the ASSU's argu
ments against paying fair interest
rates to student organizations.
The University requires all student
organizations to bank with the ASSU
even those that receive no funds
from the ASSU. It is only fair for
groups to receive an interest rate on
their accounts that is competitive with
what they could get if they were free
to put their money where they want:
be that a bank, a certificate of deposit
or a South Africa-free money fund.
A 'yes' vote for the referendum on
Wednesday and Thursday will re
quire the ASSU to offer competitive
rates.
What if the referendum fails? The
ASSU Senate has been presented
with its finance committee's unani
mous proposal that would reduce in
terest rates to 4 percent.
The ASSU financial manager was
quoted in an article (Daily, May 16)
as saying that interest rates won't
necessarily be cut to 4 percent, but
that 4 percent was merely a
guaranteed lower limit. Although
that is true, groups that divest along
with the ASSU will not receive more
than 4 percent unless the ASSU in
turn receives more than 8.5 percent
on its South Africa-free investments.
This is not only unlikely, but if the
ASSU were receiving an 8.5 percent
return, they could make an extra
$ 13,400 in profits above what is cur

rently budgeted. In this case, the
ASSU's supposed budget woes would
be solved and they would have no
excuse for not paying competitive in
terest rates. Thus the ASSU financial
managers argument is a bit mislead
ing and more than a bit irrelevant.
You would think that the "senate
recommendation" that will appear in
the elections handbook and in The
Daily accurately represents the
opinions of the senators. However,
the senate never approved it, I never
saw it before it was sent to the
typesetter, and most senators still
haven't seen it at the time of this
writing. Whose view does it repre
sent?
That statement claims that there
are "changes in the works" to im
prove interest rates. As a senator, I
have seen no indication that the sen
ate intends to raise any interest rates
to a competitive level. Look at the
senate's record: two meetings ago the
senate voted to put off consideration
of paying competitive rates; at the
most recent senate meeting, the sen
ate refused again to consider the issue
and passed a procedural motion to
postpone consideration indefinitely. I
would love to see the senate vote to
raise interest rates this Tuesday (May
20), but as I write this the only
serious "change in the works' is the
referendum on Wednesday and
Thursday.
This referendum is obviously fa
vorable to student organizations.
However. I am not a member of any
student organization and therefore

represent no special interest. I just
feel that the ASSU should be fair. If
you think so too, vote 'yes' on Wed
nesday or Thursday.

Davies editorial
based on errors

The recent editorial entitled
"Davies deserves appeal" (Daily,
May 15) was based upon a number of
factual errors, the most important of
which I address below:
(1) The University did not "refuse
to give Davies ... a clear justifica
tion" of the reasons that the History
Department voted against offering
him an appointment. On the con
trary, I described those reasons in a
seven-page single-spaced letter to
Prof. Davies. If he wishes to disclose
the contents of that letter to the Stan
ford community, he is perfectly free
to do so. For reasons I hope would be
apparent, the decision about whether
the letter should be made public is
appropriately Davies", not mine.
(2) It is not true that Davies was
"left with no choice but to File suit."
At the time that I offered to provide
him with a written statement of the
reasons for the decision. I also indi
cated that I would consider conduct
ing a further investigation if. after re
ceiving my letter, he had additional
evidence to present that suggested

improper considerations had a
bearing on the decision. However, he
chose to file suit prior even to receiv
ing my letter.
(3) It is a gross misinterpretation
and oversimplification of the issues
for the author of the editorial to have
reduced the reasons for the depart
ment's decision to one of
"partisanship.The issue of a
scholars objectivity in the practice of
his or her discipline is, of course, im
portant: it was, however, only one
element in the decision and even that
issue was not limited to the question
of Davies' treatment of Polish-Jewish
relations.
Editorials provide a useful forum in
which to express opinion. Readers
would be better served, however, if
the opinions expressed were built
upon a factual basis.

prove interest rates. As a senator, I
have seen no indication that the sen
ate intends to raise any interest rates
to a competitive level. Look at the
senate's record: two meetings ago the
senate voted to put off consideration
of paying competitive rates; at the
most recent senate meeting, the sen
ate refused again to consider the issue
and passed a procedural motion to
postpone consideration indefinitely. I
would love to see the senate vote to
raise interest rates this Tuesday (May
20), but as I write this the only
serious "change in the works' is the
referendum on Wednesday and
Thursday.
This referendum is obviously fa
vorable to student organizations.
However. I am not a member of any
student organization and therefore

represent no special interest. I just
feel that the ASSU should be fair. If
you think so too, vote 'yes' on Wed
nesday or Thursday.

Davies editorial
based on errors

The recent editorial entitled
"Davies deserves appeal" (Daily,
May 15) was based upon a number of
factual errors, the most important of
which I address below:
(1) The University did not "refuse
to give Davies ... a clear justifica
tion" of the reasons that the History
Department voted against offering
him an appointment. On the con
trary, I described those reasons in a
seven-page single-spaced letter to
Prof. Davies. If he wishes to disclose
the contents of that letter to the Stan
ford community, he is perfectly free
to do so. For reasons I hope would be
apparent, the decision about whether
the letter should be made public is
appropriately Davies", not mine.
(2) It is not true that Davies was
"left with no choice but to File suit."
At the time that I offered to provide
him with a written statement of the
reasons for the decision. I also indi
cated that I would consider conduct
ing a further investigation if. after re
ceiving my letter, he had additional
evidence to present that suggested

improper considerations had a
bearing on the decision. However, he
chose to file suit prior even to receiv
ing my letter.
(3) It is a gross misinterpretation
and oversimplification of the issues
for the author of the editorial to have
reduced the reasons for the depart
ment's decision to one of
"partisanship.The issue of a
scholars objectivity in the practice of
his or her discipline is, of course, im
portant: it was, however, only one
element in the decision and even that
issue was not limited to the question
of Davies' treatment of Polish-Jewish
relations.
Editorials provide a useful forum in
which to express opinion. Readers
would be better served, however, if
the opinions expressed were built
upon a factual basis.

Referendum is a
vote for fairness
I just don't buy the ASSU's argu
ments against paying fair interest
rates to student organizations.
The University requires all student
organizations to bank with the ASSU
even those that receive no funds
from the ASSU. It is only fair for
groups to receive an interest rate on
their accounts that is competitive with
what they could get if they were free
to put their money where they want:
be that a bank, a certificate of deposit
or a South Africa-free money fund.
A 'yes' vote for the referendum on
Wednesday and Thursday will re
quire the ASSU to offer competitive
rates.
What if the referendum fails? The
ASSU Senate has been presented
with its finance committee's unani
mous proposal that would reduce in
terest rates to 4 percent.
The ASSU financial manager was
quoted in an article (Daily, May 16)
as saying that interest rates won't
necessarily be cut to 4 percent, but
that 4 percent was merely a
guaranteed lower limit. Although
that is true, groups that divest along
with the ASSU will not receive more
than 4 percent unless the ASSU in
turn receives more than 8.5 percent
on its South Africa-free investments.
This is not only unlikely, but if the
ASSU were receiving an 8.5 percent
return, they could make an extra
$ 13,400 in profits above what is cur

rently budgeted. In this case, the
ASSU's supposed budget woes would
be solved and they would have no
excuse for not paying competitive in
terest rates. Thus the ASSU financial
managers argument is a bit mislead
ing and more than a bit irrelevant.
You would think that the "senate
recommendation" that will appear in
the elections handbook and in The
Daily accurately represents the
opinions of the senators. However,
the senate never approved it, I never
saw it before it was sent to the
typesetter, and most senators still
haven't seen it at the time of this
writing. Whose view does it repre
sent?
That statement claims that there
are "changes in the works" to im
prove interest rates. As a senator, I
have seen no indication that the sen
ate intends to raise any interest rates
to a competitive level. Look at the
senate's record: two meetings ago the
