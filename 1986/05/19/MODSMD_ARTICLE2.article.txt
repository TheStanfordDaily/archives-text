# Farm gets $817,000 to study teaching

### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
Stanford researchers have been
granted $817,000 from the Carnegie
Corp. of New York to develop new
ways to assess teachers' performance.
Education Prof. Lee Shulman and
a group of colleagues will be using the
funds to discover what combination
of qualities makes a good teacher.
According to Shulman, none of the
existing assessments for teachers get
at the essential features of teaching.
" Right now, teachers are just being
tested on basics," he said. "Exams
have set minimum requirements for
teachers. Often (tests) require no
more than eighth-grade competence
in reading, writing and arithmetic.

"We aie just testing teachers'to
screen out incompetence instead of
searching for excellence. One of the
problems we have.is that people have
adopted the myth that the people
teaching are not very smart. But there
are a lot of smart people out there
who want to teach," Shulman said.
Among Shulman's tasks will be to
determine:
• What teachers need to know and be
able to do.
• How this knowledge and skill can
be assessed.
• How assessment can be conducted
in a way that is valid, equitable,
economical, politically feasible,
professionally responsible and
publicly accountable.
Shulman's work, which will be

focused on elementary and secondary
school teachers, aims to empower
teachers to create and enforce stand
ards in education. "In part underly
ing the problems in choosing teachers
is that members of the teaching
profession have not been responsible
for their own assessment,"' he said.
Most professions, including law.
medicine and architecture, already
exercise authority to set standards in
ternally. "Teaching cannot gain the
broad legitimacy accorded other pro
fessions if the public does not believe
that teachers possess the expert
knowledge grounded in science and
experience and transmitted through a
program of professional education,"
Shulman said.
The project Shulman and other
Stanford researchers are carrying out

is just a step toward many educa
tional reforms proposed by the Car
negie Forum on Education and the
Economy in a report released this
weekend.
The report, entitled." A Nation
Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Cen
tury," calls for a radical change in
what is taught in schools and how
schools are structured, all based on a
new level of "professional teacher,"
who will be responsible for deciding
what techniques to use to produce
highly educated students.
Shulman's research will aid a na
tional board for professional teaching
standards to help determine what
teachers need to know and do, and
how to test this before certifying
them.
