"We are in transition as women," said televi
sion show host Jan Rasmusson, "because right at
once we are grappling with children, a husband,
trying to be happy and doing everything that's as
signed to us and everything we choose to do —
and it's hard."

Rasmusson, along with Stanford alumna Kate
Kelly, were among seven Bay Area television
women honored by Palo Alto's Resource Center
for Women at a champagne and cocktail buffet at
the Menlo Circus Club Friday evening.
The seven women, who have all grappled their
way to near the top of the prestigious and com
petitive television world, were: magazine show
hostesses Rasmusson and Jan Yanehiro; news

reporters Kelly, Ysabel
Duron and Cheryl Jen
nings; nationally synd
icated exercise star Joanie
Greggains; and "Romper
Room and Friends" host
Ruby Petersen.
Before a host of flash
ing cameras and glaring
television lights, the
women charmed the 500
guests with a mix of
humor, professional ad
vice and political state
ments.
"Let's all grapple to
gether," Rasmusson said
to the mostly female
crowd.
The honorees, success
ful in an industry in which
Petersen said fewer than 5
percent of the top-level
managers are women,
spoke of the changing
roles of women in today's
business and social
arenas, focusing on differ
ent aspects of "women in
transition."
KPIX news reporter
and weekend anchor
woman Kate Kelly, a
1978 Stanford graduate,
said that the first years of
working are a period of
transition for individual
women, emphasizing the

value of resource outlets such as the Center for
Women, which was founded in 1973. The Center
offers career counseling, employment training
and information to 16,000 women and men each
year.
"Even though we are 5 1 percent of the popula
tion," women are still "a minority," said Peter
sen, who is founder of Women United for
Women and president of Women United For
Fun. "It's confusing. . . . But perceptions are
reality."
Peterson said that all of her life she has been
discriminated against because she is a woman.
Now, "I'm beginning to see the tables turning."
But women still need to work harder in what
has been a man's world. "Women are the new
immigrants," Petersen said. "We still have some
thing to prove, and smart men know that."
Ysabel Duron, who has worked in television
for 15 years and is anchorwoman and reporter
for KICU, also noted that opportunities are im
proving for women today. "Sixteen years ago, it
seemed like a very lonely place for us," she said.
"I am especially honored (tonight), because it
is women honoring women This is lovely."
Duron, a graudate of San Jose State Univer
sity, received an Emmy Award for her coverage
of the Patricia Hearst kidnapping in 1974.
Jennings, who received a commendation from
the White House for her work, said she got her
professional opening to broadcasting through a
friend. "She allowed me to work for free 50
hours-a-week," she said, smiling.
Kelly and Jennings, a Channel 7 news reporter,
shared the stage, delighting many of the guests.
"Let's bring them up both up together," said
the program's master of ceremonies C.J. Bron
son, radio KNBR personality, as she introduced
the two. "I thing that's every man's fantasy."
When Greggains, star of the nationally synd
icated "Morning Stretch" exercise show spoke,
she was waving her arms and almost jumping in
place. Wearing a snugly fitted, two-piece white
suit, she quickly pointed out her shoulder pads to
the audience. "People have been asking me," she
said, "but no, these aren't my shoulders —
really," she said;
