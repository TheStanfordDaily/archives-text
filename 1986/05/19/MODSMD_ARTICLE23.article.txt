## Titans clash in NCAA tennis final Brennan optimistic as top-seeded Card takes on No. 2 USC for national title 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas — Unforeseen weather conditions
here have made a mess of this week's NCAA Women's
Tennis Championships, but not even tornado warnings
could keep Stanford and USC from meeting in today's
final.
The two teams have dominated collegiate tennis the
past four years as the Cardinal won the title in 1982 and
1984, and the Trojans were victorious in 1983 and 1985.
This year has been no exception. Stanford is 20-1 and
seeded first in the tournament. USC (22-2) is ranked No.
1 nationally and seeded No. 2 here.
"It will definitely be an intense match," the Cardinal's
Kay Tittle said.
Here are the six singles confrontations:
1. Patty Feudick (S) vs. Caroline Kuhlinan (USC)
Kuhlman is undefeated and is the top-ranked singles
player in the nation. She has defeated Fendick twice in the
regular season. "She has an outstanding record, which is a
tribute to her tenacity," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said.
Both Brennan and Asst. Coach Linda Gates believe the
key to the match will be Fendick's ability to come to the
net and Kuhlman's ability to pass her.
"I think when Patty is at her best and Kuhlman is at her
best, Patty will win," Brennan said. "The problem is
Kuhlman has played better more often."
2. Marianne Werdel (S) vs. Heliane Steden (USC)
This could be the key match. Steden began the season
on fire, being ranked in nation's top five, but since has
slowed down considerably. "Steden tends to burn out,"
Brennan said.
On the other hand, Werdel has progressed since a shaky
start, though she has been taken to three sets in her past
two matches.
If Werdel can come out strong today, the shaky Steden
could be easy pickings. "I feel pretty good about that
one," Brennan said.
3. Leigh Anne Eldredge (S) vs. Maeve Quinlan (USC)
This one would figure to be Stanford's match. Eldredge
played magnificently in yesterday's semifinal, and Quin
lan has dropped her past two matches badly.
"We're supposed to win that one," Brennan said. "If
we lose, it could be critical."
4. Stephanie Savides (S) vs. Mary Norwood (USC)
While Eldredge is a virtual shoo-in at No. 3, it would be
surprising if Savides wins this match. She has lost all three
singles matches here as well as her confidence.
Savides has been suffering from strategical problems in
her matches, while Norwood has been cruising through
the first three rounds.

Leigh Anne Eldredge has yet to lose a set in any of her three singles matches at the NCAA Championships in
Austin, Texas. Three of Eldredge's six sets have been won 6-0. Stanford is expecting another convincing win
from Eldredge today against USC's Maeve Quinlan, as Quinlan, has lost her last two matches.
5. Kay Tittle (S) vs. Ginny Purely (USC)
Tittle and Purdy have been equally impressive during
the tournament, but Brennan and Gates believe that
Tittle will win this one. "I think Kay's got the edge,"
Brennan said.
"Kay's a lot better athlete," Gates said. "She has to be
aggressive at the beginning."
"I feel a little more pressure to win that match," Tittle
said. "That's one of the matches that we need to win."
6. Cari Hagey (S) vs. Claudia Hernandez (USC)
Normally, Dena Levy would be playing No. 6 for the
Trojans, but Hagey beat her so thoroughly at Stanford

that USC has altered its lineup.
"I think (USC Coach Dave) Borelli made his lineup for
us," Brennan said. "He felt that Levy was intimidated by
Hagey."
Hernandez will have to play a great match to beat
Hagey, who has lost just twice this season at No. 6. "Cari
is a great athlete," Brennan said. "She has great courage."
If the match comes down to the doubles, which Bren
nan is almost certain will happen, Stanford is in good
shape, according to the Cardinal coach.
Stanford has more natural doubles talent in its lineup,
Brennan indicated.
In comparing the two teams, Brennan said, "I think
we're better. If we play them 10 times, we'd win six or
seven. I don't know which time it will be tomorrow.
"We are sort of a hot-and-cold team," he added.
"We've been hot lately."


Jeff Stevens/ Daily
The fortunes of Stanford's Marianne Werdel and her USC opponent today, Heliane Steden, have been going
in opposite directions lately. Werdel has recovered from a shaky start, while Steden's game has deteriorated
since early in the season, when she was ranked among the nation's top five players.

Leigh Anne Eldredge has yet to lose a set in any of her three singles matches at the NCAA Championships in
Austin, Texas. Three of Eldredge's six sets have been won 6-0. Stanford is expecting another convincing win
from Eldredge today against USC's Maeve Quinlan, as Quinlan, has lost her last two matches.
5. Kay Tittle (S) vs. Ginny Purely (USC)
Tittle and Purdy have been equally impressive during
the tournament, but Brennan and Gates believe that
Tittle will win this one. "I think Kay's got the edge,"
Brennan said.
"Kay's a lot better athlete," Gates said. "She has to be
aggressive at the beginning."
"I feel a little more pressure to win that match," Tittle
said. "That's one of the matches that we need to win."
6. Cari Hagey (S) vs. Claudia Hernandez (USC)
Normally, Dena Levy would be playing No. 6 for the
Trojans, but Hagey beat her so thoroughly at Stanford

that USC has altered its lineup.
"I think (USC Coach Dave) Borelli made his lineup for
us," Brennan said. "He felt that Levy was intimidated by
Hagey."
Hernandez will have to play a great match to beat
Hagey, who has lost just twice this season at No. 6. "Cari
is a great athlete," Brennan said. "She has great courage."
If the match comes down to the doubles, which Bren
nan is almost certain will happen, Stanford is in good
shape, according to the Cardinal coach.
Stanford has more natural doubles talent in its lineup,
Brennan indicated.
In comparing the two teams, Brennan said, "I think
we're better. If we play them 10 times, we'd win six or
seven. I don't know which time it will be tomorrow.
"We are sort of a hot-and-cold team," he added.
"We've been hot lately."

The fortunes of Stanford's Marianne Werdel and her USC opponent today, Heliane Steden, have been going
in opposite directions lately. Werdel has recovered from a shaky start, while Steden's game has deteriorated
since early in the season, when she was ranked among the nation's top five players.
AUSTIN, Texas — Unforeseen weather conditions
here have made a mess of this week's NCAA Women's
Tennis Championships, but not even tornado warnings
could keep Stanford and USC from meeting in today's
final.
The two teams have dominated collegiate tennis the
past four years as the Cardinal won the title in 1982 and
1984, and the Trojans were victorious in 1983 and 1985.
This year has been no exception. Stanford is 20-1 and
seeded first in the tournament. USC (22-2) is ranked No.
1 nationally and seeded No. 2 here.
"It will definitely be an intense match," the Cardinal's
Kay Tittle said.
Here are the six singles confrontations:
1. Patty Feudick (S) vs. Caroline Kuhlinan (USC)
Kuhlman is undefeated and is the top-ranked singles
player in the nation. She has defeated Fendick twice in the
regular season. "She has an outstanding record, which is a
tribute to her tenacity," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said.
Both Brennan and Asst. Coach Linda Gates believe the
key to the match will be Fendick's ability to come to the
net and Kuhlman's ability to pass her.
"I think when Patty is at her best and Kuhlman is at her
best, Patty will win," Brennan said. "The problem is
Kuhlman has played better more often."
2. Marianne Werdel (S) vs. Heliane Steden (USC)
This could be the key match. Steden began the season
on fire, being ranked in nation's top five, but since has
slowed down considerably. "Steden tends to burn out,"
Brennan said.
On the other hand, Werdel has progressed since a shaky
start, though she has been taken to three sets in her past
two matches.
If Werdel can come out strong today, the shaky Steden
could be easy pickings. "I feel pretty good about that
one," Brennan said.
3. Leigh Anne Eldredge (S) vs. Maeve Quinlan (USC)
This one would figure to be Stanford's match. Eldredge
played magnificently in yesterday's semifinal, and Quin
lan has dropped her past two matches badly.
"We're supposed to win that one," Brennan said. "If
we lose, it could be critical."
4. Stephanie Savides (S) vs. Mary Norwood (USC)
While Eldredge is a virtual shoo-in at No. 3, it would be
surprising if Savides wins this match. She has lost all three
singles matches here as well as her confidence.
Savides has been suffering from strategical problems in
her matches, while Norwood has been cruising through
the first three rounds.
