AUSTIN, Texas â€” No. 5 seed Miami came into yester
day's semifinal of the NCAA Women's Tennis Cham
pionships boasting the top doubles lineup in the country,
but top-seeded Stanford won five of the six singles
matches here at the Penick-Allison Tennis Center to elim
inate the Hurricanes before the doubles matches began.
The Cardinal went on to win the match 6-3 to advance
to today's 4 p.m. final against No. 2 seed USC, which beat
Trinity yesterday 6-3 in the other semifinal.
Friday, Stanford had beaten Northwestern 5-1 in the
quarterfinals. The Wildcats challenged the Cardinal early
in most of the singles matches, but Stanford prevailed in
five of the six to avoid having to play doubles.
"1 was secretly happy we got tough matches," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
The Cardinal then had to sit and wait Saturday as the
tournament was pushed back a day by thunderstorms and
tornado warnings.
The wait was well worth it, however, as the Cardinal
dominated yesterday's match from the outset to raise its
record to 20-1.
"I really thought we were going to win," Brennan said
after the match.
"The matches that we won were so easy," Stanford
Asst. Coach Linda Gates said.
The easiest of the easy came at No. 3 singles, as Card
inal junior Leigh Anne Eldredge completely outplayed
Miami's Ros Riach to record a 6-2, 6-0 victory.
Although strong winds were wreaking havoc with many
of the players' shots, Eldredge seemed unaffected yester
day. "When there's wind, you have to keep moving," she
said. "1 don't like wind, but I've adjusted to it a lot bet
ter."
Eldredge attributed part of her success to the day
layoff. "This morning when I came out, 1 felt really fresh
and eager," she said. "Sometimes when there's something
wrong with your stroke, a day off helps."
There was nothing wrong with Eldredge's stroke yester
day, as she moved Riach around the court at will. "I did
feel like 1 had a lot more control," Eldredge said. "I don't
know how on top of her game she was. She missed a lot of
shots."
Stanford's Patty Fendick was on top of her game yester
day, which spelled doom for Miami's highly-ranked Ronni
Reis. The Cardinal junior hit well from the baseline as
well as the net to score a 6-3, 6-0 victory in the No. 1
singles match.
"That was an outstanding performance," Brennan said.
"Patty made her ( Reis) cave in."
The Cardinal's Cari Hagey made the score 3-0 as she
