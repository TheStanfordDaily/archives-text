# Stanford blows Hurricanes away with five singles triumphs in semis
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas — No. 5 seed Miami came into yester
day's semifinal of the NCAA Women's Tennis Cham
pionships boasting the top doubles lineup in the country,
but top-seeded Stanford won five of the six singles
matches here at the Penick-Allison Tennis Center to elim
inate the Hurricanes before the doubles matches began.
The Cardinal went on to win the match 6-3 to advance
to today's 4 p.m. final against No. 2 seed USC, which beat
Trinity yesterday 6-3 in the other semifinal.
Friday, Stanford had beaten Northwestern 5-1 in the
quarterfinals. The Wildcats challenged the Cardinal early
in most of the singles matches, but Stanford prevailed in
five of the six to avoid having to play doubles.
"1 was secretly happy we got tough matches," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
The Cardinal then had to sit and wait Saturday as the
tournament was pushed back a day by thunderstorms and
tornado warnings.
The wait was well worth it, however, as the Cardinal
dominated yesterday's match from the outset to raise its
record to 20-1.
"I really thought we were going to win," Brennan said
after the match.
"The matches that we won were so easy," Stanford
Asst. Coach Linda Gates said.
The easiest of the easy came at No. 3 singles, as Card
inal junior Leigh Anne Eldredge completely outplayed
Miami's Ros Riach to record a 6-2, 6-0 victory.
Although strong winds were wreaking havoc with many
of the players' shots, Eldredge seemed unaffected yester
day. "When there's wind, you have to keep moving," she
said. "1 don't like wind, but I've adjusted to it a lot bet
ter."
Eldredge attributed part of her success to the day
layoff. "This morning when I came out, 1 felt really fresh
and eager," she said. "Sometimes when there's something
wrong with your stroke, a day off helps."
There was nothing wrong with Eldredge's stroke yester
day, as she moved Riach around the court at will. "I did
feel like 1 had a lot more control," Eldredge said. "I don't
know how on top of her game she was. She missed a lot of
shots."
Stanford's Patty Fendick was on top of her game yester
day, which spelled doom for Miami's highly-ranked Ronni
Reis. The Cardinal junior hit well from the baseline as
well as the net to score a 6-3, 6-0 victory in the No. 1
singles match.
"That was an outstanding performance," Brennan said.
"Patty made her ( Reis) cave in."
The Cardinal's Cari Hagey made the score 3-0 as she
continued her outstanding tourna
ment with a 6-2, 6-1 victory in the
No. 6 singles over Vanessa Binns.
Binns was yelling and stomping
about the court throughout the
match, but the only noise coming
from Hagey was via her racket.
The Stanford sophomore came to
the net as often as possible, and Binns
could not come up with passing shots.
"That second set, she was really dyn
amite," Brennan said.
As quickly as the spectators on
hand could shift their attention away
from the Hagey-Binns match, Stan
ford's Kay Tittle was locking up the
No. 5 singles match. The native of Ir
ving, Texas, put the Cardinal up 4-0
with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Miami's
Susana Rojas.
After taking an early 3-0 lead in
the first set, Tittle was caught at 4-4.
"I was really tight in the first set," she
said. "You can't not be nervous in the
semis of Nationals. I need to try to
relax."
Tittle held her serve and then
broke Rojas to capture the set 6-4.
"Kay was the better player once
she got over her initial case of
nerves," Brennan said.
Tittle wore down her Miami op
ponent in the second set with long
baseline rallies and came to the net to
finish off points when necessary.
The Cardinal parade was halted as
Elizabeth Levinson of the Hurricanes
beat Stanford's Stephanie Savides in
the No. 4 singles 6-3, 3-6, 6-0. The
loss was Savides' third straight in the
tournament.
"Stephanie got off to a slow start,
played a beautiful second set and
then inexplicably changed her strat
egy," Brennan said.
Following her lackadaisical first
set, Savides played so well in the

second that she had Levinson scream
ing at herself. But then the Cardinal
junior went away from her aggressive
net game and was content to sit at the
baseline. "In third set, she decided
she couldn't do it (come to the net),"
Brennan said. "She has to learn to
play well when she's ahead."
With the score 4-1 and the knowl
edge that Miami was eager to play
doubles, all of the attention and pres
sure was focused on Stanford's
Marianne Werdel in the No. 2 singles.
After dropping the first set 6-4 to
the Hurricanes' Lise Gregory, Wer
del quickly took the second 6-1. She
then won the first two games of the
decisive set before Gregory caught
her.
With her back up against the wall,
Gregory broke Werdel's serve at 6-5
to force a tiebreaker.
Both players missed easy shots
throughout the tiebreaker, but with
the score 5-4, Werdel came up with
two brilliant shots. Gregory could not
return a powerful Werdel serve to
make the score 6-4, and then the
Cardinal freshman pounded a back
hand passing shot down the line to
win the match and clinch the team
victory.
"I think we can hold our own in
doubles, but it's nice to win in
singles," Eldredge said after her
match.
Although the match was clinched,
both teams agreed to play doubles,
much to Brennan's satisfaction. The
Cardinal had not played any quality
doubles since its May 2 match in
Westwood against UCLA.
Stanford's No. 3 team of Tittle and
Werdel annihilated Levinson and
Binns 6-0, 6-0 to record the Card
inal's final victory.
"I thought the third doubles match
was really a mismatch," Gates said.
"We were happy with the way we
played," Tittle said. "We know to
morrow's (doubles match) is going to
be key."

"The three team got two good
practice sets in," Brennan said.
Riach and Cathy Richman surpris-
ingly swept Savides and Hagey 6-2,
6-3 in the No. 2 doubles.
The No. 1 doubles pitted two of the

country's top teams. Reis and
Gregory edged Fendick and Eldredge
4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
"The No. 1 team played pretty
well," Brennan said. "They'll be
much more ready (today)."

The Cardinal's Cari Hagey made the score 3-0 as she
continued her outstanding tourna
ment with a 6-2, 6-1 victory in the
No. 6 singles over Vanessa Binns.
Binns was yelling and stomping
about the court throughout the
match, but the only noise coming
from Hagey was via her racket.
The Stanford sophomore came to
the net as often as possible, and Binns
could not come up with passing shots.
"That second set, she was really dyn
amite," Brennan said.
As quickly as the spectators on
hand could shift their attention away
from the Hagey-Binns match, Stan
ford's Kay Tittle was locking up the
No. 5 singles match. The native of Ir
ving, Texas, put the Cardinal up 4-0
with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Miami's
Susana Rojas.
After taking an early 3-0 lead in
the first set, Tittle was caught at 4-4.
"I was really tight in the first set," she
said. "You can't not be nervous in the
semis of Nationals. I need to try to
relax."
Tittle held her serve and then
broke Rojas to capture the set 6-4.
"Kay was the better player once
she got over her initial case of
nerves," Brennan said.
Tittle wore down her Miami op
ponent in the second set with long
baseline rallies and came to the net to
finish off points when necessary.
The Cardinal parade was halted as
Elizabeth Levinson of the Hurricanes
beat Stanford's Stephanie Savides in
the No. 4 singles 6-3, 3-6, 6-0. The
loss was Savides' third straight in the
tournament.
"Stephanie got off to a slow start,
played a beautiful second set and
then inexplicably changed her strat
egy," Brennan said.
Following her lackadaisical first
set, Savides played so well in the

second that she had Levinson scream
ing at herself. But then the Cardinal
junior went away from her aggressive
net game and was content to sit at the
baseline. "In third set, she decided
she couldn't do it (come to the net),"
Brennan said. "She has to learn to
play well when she's ahead."
With the score 4-1 and the knowl
edge that Miami was eager to play
doubles, all of the attention and pres
sure was focused on Stanford's
Marianne Werdel in the No. 2 singles.
After dropping the first set 6-4 to
the Hurricanes' Lise Gregory, Wer
del quickly took the second 6-1. She
then won the first two games of the
decisive set before Gregory caught
her.
With her back up against the wall,
Gregory broke Werdel's serve at 6-5
to force a tiebreaker.
Both players missed easy shots
throughout the tiebreaker, but with
the score 5-4, Werdel came up with
two brilliant shots. Gregory could not
return a powerful Werdel serve to
make the score 6-4, and then the
Cardinal freshman pounded a back
hand passing shot down the line to
win the match and clinch the team
victory.
"I think we can hold our own in
doubles, but it's nice to win in
singles," Eldredge said after her
match.
Although the match was clinched,
both teams agreed to play doubles,
much to Brennan's satisfaction. The
Cardinal had not played any quality
doubles since its May 2 match in
Westwood against UCLA.
Stanford's No. 3 team of Tittle and
Werdel annihilated Levinson and
Binns 6-0, 6-0 to record the Card
inal's final victory.
"I thought the third doubles match
was really a mismatch," Gates said.
"We were happy with the way we
played," Tittle said. "We know to
morrow's (doubles match) is going to
be key."

"The three team got two good
practice sets in," Brennan said.
Riach and Cathy Richman surpris-
ingly swept Savides and Hagey 6-2,
6-3 in the No. 2 doubles.
The No. 1 doubles pitted two of the

country's top teams. Reis and
Gregory edged Fendick and Eldredge
4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
"The No. 1 team played pretty
well," Brennan said. "They'll be
much more ready (today)."

Kay Tittle was devastating in Stanford's 6-3 win over Miami yesterday,
beating Susana Rojas 6-4, 6-1 at No. 5 singles and combining with
Marianne Werdel to whitewash Elizabeth Levinson and Vanessa Binns
6-0, 6-0.
AUSTIN, Texas — No. 5 seed Miami came into yester
day's semifinal of the NCAA Women's Tennis Cham
pionships boasting the top doubles lineup in the country,
but top-seeded Stanford won five of the six singles
matches here at the Penick-Allison Tennis Center to elim
inate the Hurricanes before the doubles matches began.
The Cardinal went on to win the match 6-3 to advance
to today's 4 p.m. final against No. 2 seed USC, which beat
Trinity yesterday 6-3 in the other semifinal.
Friday, Stanford had beaten Northwestern 5-1 in the
quarterfinals. The Wildcats challenged the Cardinal early
in most of the singles matches, but Stanford prevailed in
five of the six to avoid having to play doubles.
"1 was secretly happy we got tough matches," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
The Cardinal then had to sit and wait Saturday as the
tournament was pushed back a day by thunderstorms and
tornado warnings.
The wait was well worth it, however, as the Cardinal
dominated yesterday's match from the outset to raise its
record to 20-1.
"I really thought we were going to win," Brennan said
after the match.
"The matches that we won were so easy," Stanford
Asst. Coach Linda Gates said.
The easiest of the easy came at No. 3 singles, as Card
inal junior Leigh Anne Eldredge completely outplayed
Miami's Ros Riach to record a 6-2, 6-0 victory.
Although strong winds were wreaking havoc with many
of the players' shots, Eldredge seemed unaffected yester
day. "When there's wind, you have to keep moving," she
said. "1 don't like wind, but I've adjusted to it a lot bet
ter."
Eldredge attributed part of her success to the day
layoff. "This morning when I came out, 1 felt really fresh
and eager," she said. "Sometimes when there's something
wrong with your stroke, a day off helps."
There was nothing wrong with Eldredge's stroke yester
day, as she moved Riach around the court at will. "I did
feel like 1 had a lot more control," Eldredge said. "I don't
know how on top of her game she was. She missed a lot of
shots."
Stanford's Patty Fendick was on top of her game yester
day, which spelled doom for Miami's highly-ranked Ronni
Reis. The Cardinal junior hit well from the baseline as
well as the net to score a 6-3, 6-0 victory in the No. 1
singles match.
"That was an outstanding performance," Brennan said.
"Patty made her ( Reis) cave in."
