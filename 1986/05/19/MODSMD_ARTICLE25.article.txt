# Cardinal upsets No. 3 Tigers
## Win over Clemson propels Stanford into semis vs. UCLA 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS. Ga. — The hit squads
are out and hunting for the Cardinal
here. But as the Stanford tennis team
proved over the weekend, it's tough
to kill a color.
On Saturday the sixth-seeded
Cardinal survived an early-morning
threat from the Palandjian brothers
of Harvard to oust the Crimson from
the 102 nd NCAA Men's Tennis
Championships by a 5-2 score.
And yesterday the Cardinal en
gaged in a high-strung, high-noon
duel with the third-seeded Clemson
Tigers. Stanford's Scott Moody
dodged a knockout bullet from the
tenacious Tigers, and the Cardinal
then rode on to a 5-3 upset over the
favored Clemson squad.

The two victories place Stanford in
a semifinal showdown with UCLA
today at 10 a.m. EST. The Bruins
reached the semis by shutting out
Minnesota 5-0 on Saturday and
defeating Texas 5-2 yesterday.
The surprising Stanford team came
from behind in both matches over the
weekend. Midway through yester
day's match, Clemson led Stanford 3-
2 and looked to go ahead 4-2.
Clemson's Vince VanGelderen led
Moody in the third set of the No. 6
singles match by a 5-4 score, but
Moody fought back to take the set in
a tiebreaker and even the team match
score at 3-3.
The Tigers had prepared them
selves for the faceoff with Stanford by
blanking Oklahoma State 5-0 on Sat
urday. The Clemson players lost only
two sets against the Cowboys, and

many of the tennis aficionados in
Athens were picking the Tigers to win
it all.
But the Cardinal soon laid that
thought to waste.
Playing at noon in front of a
stadium crowd of 2.263, the Cardinal
and the Tigers went shot-for-shot for
most of the afternoon and provided
the most exciting match of the tourn
ament so far.
Clemson senior Richard Matus
zewski staked the Tigers to an early
1-0 lead by defeating Stanford senior
Jim Grabb 6-1. 6-3 in the No. 2
singles match.
The I3th-ranked Matuszewski
used a strong return to break Grabb's
serve all three times in the first set.
Grabb was late getting to the net on
his serve and volley, and Matuszewski
repeatedly jammed returns at

Grabb's feet. Grabb regrouped a
little bit in the second set, but Matus
zewski continued to play all-around
tennis and finished off the match.
A few minutes later Stanford soph
omore Patrick McEnroe evened the
score by beating Clemson's Brian
Page 6-1, 6-3. McEnroe rebounded
from a loss on Saturday against Har
vard, as his prominent backhand
returned to form.
"Today 1 tried to be more aggres
sive," McEnroe said. "It's not my
game to sit back and wait for the
other guy to make mistakes."
Cardinal senior Eric Rosenfeld put
Stanford ahead 2-1 minutes later by
completing his win over Tiger Kent
Kinnear, and a see-saw pattern had
begun. The crowd's attention then
shifted to the No. I singles match,
where lOth-ranked Jay Berger was
putting the final touches on Stanford
senior Dan Goldie.
In the first set of that match,
Goldie overhit everything in sight,
while Berger responded by making
every possible passing shot from
every imaginable angle — high, low,
short or deep. Goldie settled down in
the second set. and the match became
tighter. But Berger broke him in the
fifth game and held his serve the rest
of the way to win 6-3. 6-4.
The action wasn't quite over after
the last point, however. Instead of
shaking hands at the net. Goldie and
Berger exchanged some not so com
plimentary words and had a short
shoving match.
The see-saw of momentum next
fell on Clemson's side after the No. 5
singles ended. Tiger junior Craig
Boynton outlasted Stanford's John
Letts 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. That win made
the team score 3-2 Clemson. with
only the match between Moody and
VanGelderen still in progress.
As the crowd moved over to court
six, VanGelderen led 6-3. 6-7, 5-4.
Moody, who seemed to thrive on
pressure all weekend, forced the
match into a deciding tiebreaker. The
two players stayed even in the tie
breaker until, with Moody leading 6-
5 and VanGelderen serving, the Stan
ford junior charged a second serve,
then put the volley and the match
away. It was the second clutch win for
Moody in two days.
"That was the key match for us,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "If

Patrick McEnroe was responsible for both Stanford's first and final wins in the Cardinal's 5-3 triumph over
Clemson yesterday. His 6-1, 6-3 thrashing of Brian Page at No. 3 singles tied the match at 1-1; then he teamed
with John Letts at No. 2 doubles to beat Page and Matt Frooman 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 to clinch the victory for Stanford.
