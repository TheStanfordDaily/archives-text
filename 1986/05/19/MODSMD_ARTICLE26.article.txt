# Moody keeps things exciting

ATHENS, Ga. — Anyone with
a nervous temperament shouldn't
watch his matches; they are often
gut-wrenching, three-set, come
from-behind events. Admirers of
beauty in tennis won't like his
game; it ain't pretty. Anyone with
neck problems shouldn't watch his
points; they whip back and forth,
short and hard.
But anyone who likes sports
excitement — bottom-of-the
ninth type situations — should
love to watch Stanford junior

Scott Moody play tennis.
Moody, who hails from
Larchmont, N.Y., has been a
fixture at the No. 6 singles spot for
Stanford all year, compiling a 13-9
record. His game is serve-and
volley — all the time.
After the first few games of a
match, his opponents seem to get
his message: "I'm coming to the
net, and you're going to have to
pass me to beat me." Mentally,
going to the net every time is not
an easy thing to do.

Scott Moody's aggressive net-charging style has led to many
nerve-wracking matches in his Stanford career, including yesterday's
3-6, 7-6, 7-6 win over Clemson's Vince VanGelderen.
