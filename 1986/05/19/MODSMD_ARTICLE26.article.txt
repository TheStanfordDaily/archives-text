# Moody keeps things exciting

ATHENS, Ga. — Anyone with
a nervous temperament shouldn't
watch his matches; they are often
gut-wrenching, three-set, come
from-behind events. Admirers of
beauty in tennis won't like his
game; it ain't pretty. Anyone with
neck problems shouldn't watch his
points; they whip back and forth,
short and hard.
But anyone who likes sports
excitement — bottom-of-the
ninth type situations — should
love to watch Stanford junior

Scott Moody play tennis.
Moody, who hails from
Larchmont, N.Y., has been a
fixture at the No. 6 singles spot for
Stanford all year, compiling a 13-9
record. His game is serve-and
volley — all the time.
After the first few games of a
match, his opponents seem to get
his message: "I'm coming to the
net, and you're going to have to
pass me to beat me." Mentally,
going to the net every time is not
an easy thing to do.

Scott Moody's aggressive net-charging style has led to many
nerve-wracking matches in his Stanford career, including yesterday's
3-6, 7-6, 7-6 win over Clemson's Vince VanGelderen.
"His style of play gives his oppo
nents plenty of chances to hit win
ners, and they're going to get their
share," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said. "The big stride Scott has made is
that he no longer worries about it
(he) just concentrates on playing well
himself."
Since he is in the No. 6 position,
one thing Moody doesn't have to
worry about is getting too much
press.
"I get less recognition than Dan
(Goldie), Jim (Grabb) and Patrick
(McEnroe), but when I win, my point
counts just as much as theirs," Moody
said.
Moody has a tendency to start slow
and finish strong. His three-set,
come-from-behind victories often
give the Stanford team a big shot of
momentum.
"My mother used to tell me to use
the first set to warm up. I guess I fol
low her advice too literally," he said.
"It usually takes about a set for me to

find a groove, but I won't deny a
three-set victory."
Moody's two wins in the NCAA
Championships this weekend have
made a big contribution to Stanford's
team victories.
"Scott played really great tennis to
pull it (the Harvard match) out for
us," teammate John Letts said Satur
day. "Once we got that boost, we just
wanted to run right through them."
Clemson Coach Chuck Kriese,
whose team lost to Stanford yester
day, thinks along the same lines. "I
think them winning the No. 6 singles
match gave them a big boost," he said
yesterday.
Moody also seems to thrive on
pressure. He comes up with his best
points when he's down.
"It's hard not to peek at the
scoreboard," he said. "And when I
see that the other matches are tight,
my match has a greater sense of im
portance."
Moody should thrive at the NCAA
Championships. With Stanford facing
UCLA in the semifinals today, it may
be the most important match of his
life.
