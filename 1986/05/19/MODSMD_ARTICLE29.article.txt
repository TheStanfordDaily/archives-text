### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Competing in dehydrating
Arizona heat, the Stanford
women's track team finished in
third place out of four teams in the
Pac-West Conference Champion
ships in Tempe.
Favorite USC, led by Wendy
Brown, who won the 100-meter
hurdles and set a conference
record in the triple jump with a
leap of 43-feet-l 1-1/4, won the
Pac-West, 207-181, over Arizona
State. Stanford easily outdistanced
Arizona, 127-37, to take third.
The Cardinal boasted four indi
vidual winners at the meet. Denise
Gaztambide won the heptathalon
with 5,331 points, and Pam Dukes
took the shot put with a throw of
56-8. Pam Board won the 400-
meter hurdles in 59.19, and Alison
Wiley took both the 1,500-meter
race in 4:25.19 and the 3,000 in
9:23.41.
Gaztambide, who also finished
fifth in the javelin, trailed USC's
Yolanda Fletcher by 68 points
going into the final event, the 800
meters, and needed to defeat
Fletcher by seven seconds to win.
Gaztambede did that with just a
half-second to spare.
"I was very pleased with my ef
fort," Gaztambede said,
"especially in these very warm
conditions here in Tempe."

Dukes' throw tied her personal
best and was the fourth-best U.S.
collegiate toss this year. The win
came the day after her 22nd
birthday.
"I felt great in warmups. One
throw was 58 feet, and that gave
me a lot of confidence," Dukes
said. "The 56-8 was a great feeling
of accomplishment. This is a great
time to be peaking; the hard work
has paid off.
"The weather played a key fac
tor (for the team)," Dukes said.
"Everyone was trying not to get
dehydrated."
Wiley, who won the 1,500 by
less than a second over USC's
Elise Lyon but defeated teammate
Ceci Hopp by over 25 seconds in
the 3,000, also commented on the
weather.
"The wind and heat were defi
nite factors in both races," Wiley
said. "I'm happy though because it
always feels good to win."
Lisa Bernhagen broke her year
old school record in the high jump,
soaring 6-1 1/2. Arizona's Katrena
Johnson also cleared 6-1 1/2 but
won the event on fewer misses.
As for the rest of the meet, the
Stanford relay teams placed
second in the 1,600 meters
(3:52.11) but fourth in the 400
(48.84). Karen Nickerson finished
second in the discus with a throw
of 68-7, while Rachel Wiesen ran
a 59.70 400 to finish fourth.
