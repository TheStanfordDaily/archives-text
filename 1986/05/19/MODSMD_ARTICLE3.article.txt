# Ferruolo appeals tenure decision
## Claims evaluation was 'inconsistent' 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Stanford History Prof. Stephen
Ferruolo announced Friday he will
appeal his department's decision to
deny him tenure, claiming the ruling
treated him "unfairly and dis
criminatorily."
Ferruolo, an expert on medieval
history, reversed earlier statements
that he would not file a grievance
against the department's January
decision, saying that new criteria used
in tenure review had led to an
"inconsistent" evaluation of his
scholarship.
The modified evaluation criteria,
formulated last year by Norm Wes
sels, dean of Humanities and
Sciences, demands that a candidate
for tenure has widened or changed his
discipline in a significant manner.
In addition, the new standards re
quire outside experts to evaluate the
candidate's work by comparing it
with that of foremost scholars in the
same field.
Ferruolo, the first history professor
to be judged under the new
guidelines, charged last night that
such comparisons were inappropriate
and set mpossible standards for a
scholar in his field and at his level of
scholarly development.
"They're supposed to compare me
to scholars at comparable levels of
development," Ferruolo said. "But
I'm being compared with older
scholars as well."
Such a "double standard" con
tradicts guidelines quoted in the 1984
Faculty Handbook which state that
candidates for tenure should be rated
in comparison to their "peers" in
their discipline, instead of scholars
one or even two generations older.
Ferruolo said.
Wessels, who in February de
scribed the new standards as merely a
rearticulation of "what we mean by
distinction in scholarship," was un
available for comment yesterday.
Ferruolo additionally charged that
the criteria discriminated against his
field of expertise.
"Medieval history is a very well
established field. It's not a field in
which one can make a great new dis
covery, as opposed to more recent
history, or certainly the sciences,"
Ferruolo said.
He said that such high standards,
which the department stipulated to

outside "referees" who evaluated
Ferruolo's scholarship, denied him
reasonable consideration.
He further complained that al
though several University colleagues
outside of the History Department
had favored his receiving tenure,
none had been offered a chance to
evaluate him using the same criteria,
therefore denying them a chance to
question the new standards and ren
dering impossible a "thorough"
response.
"(The new criteria) made it
impossible for the referees to look
favorably on my work, since I'm
being compared with senior
scholars," he said.
The criteria were also inconsistent
because they had been applied in a
more favorable manner to at least
one other History Department
scholar, he said, declining to offer any
specific cases.
Ferruolo, whose courses have been
consistently rated highly in student
evaluations, was denied tenure by the
department despite a unanimous re
commendation by a History Depart
ment review committee.
Ferruolo emphasized that his com
plaint was with the revised evaluation
standards and not individual mem
bers of the department.
"I'm looking for clarification and
rectification of the evaluation
process," he said, adding that part of
the inconsistency of the new criteria
stemmed from confusion at what ex
actly the new standards mean.
He added he will not pursue legal
recourse if his appeal is unsuccessful.
History Profs. Paul Seaver and
Gavin Lungmuir, both members of
the three-person committee, said ear
lier this year that the "crucial point"
in the denial had stemmed from the
area of scholarship.
Langmuir, who affirmed that the
criteria are "much tougher in the area
of scholarship," said then that the
new standards possibly discriminate
against scholars in certain fields.
"In the sciences, (significantly
changing a discipline) can be done. In
medieval history, it's very hard to
demonstrate that stage," Langmuir
said.
At the time of Ferruolo's tenure
denial, some residents of Potter
House, where Ferruolo is a resident
fellow, protested the decision. One
resident called the decision a
"crock."
