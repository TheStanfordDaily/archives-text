mind behind a Middle Eastern terror network operating in Europe, the
authoritative El Pais newspaper reported here yesterday.

Christ" terrorist group. El Pais said that Ahmed Mohamed Nakaa per
sonally organized and provided $70,000 for attacks on U.S. and Jewish
targets in Madrid and Lisbon.
The foreign ministry has said the commando group included 10 mem
bers who have been detained — three Lebanese brothers, a Jordanian, a
Syrian, four Spaniards and a Portuguese. The group first became known
in 1978 in Lebanon.
Two members of the group were arrested May 2 trying to plant ex
plosives in a Madrid branch of the Bank of America. The group is also
accused of attacks on an Air France office in Lisbon and a Paris
synagogue.

followed by a suspension of diplomatic relations between Libya and
Spain.
Contras kidnap 8 West Germans
BONN, West Germany — The West German government formed a
crisis team yesterday to help seek the release of eight West Germans ab
ducted by anti-government guerrillas in Nicaragua.
A government spokesman said the West German embassies in the
United States, Nicaragua and Honduras had been instructed to seek the
release of the Germans, who were seized from an agricultural project
Friday.
The spokesman said contact had already been established with the
kidnappers, members of the U.S.-financed Democratic Force of
Nicaragua.
A group of about 30 rebels, known as contras, seized the West Ger
mans in the village of Yacinto Vac, about 215 miles north of Managua,
the Nicaraguan capital.
They belonged to a group of 12 West German volunteers who had
arrived only two weeks before to work on an agricultural construction
project.
Four members of the group managed to escape after a government pa
trol challenged the guerrillas. A Nicaraguan spokesman said one of the
West Germans was injured in the shoot out.
The remaining eight captives were taken towards the Honduran bor
der.
Last year, a group of contras kidnapped a West German woman and
later released her in Honduras.
China, Taiwan airline talks stalled
HONG KONG — Unprecedented airline talks between China and
Taiwan seemed to reach a deadlock yesterday over the question of how
to return the Taiwanese jumbo jet cargo plane that has been in China,
along with two crew members, ever since the pilot flew it there two
weeks ago to defect.
After a second day of negotiations, representatives from Taiwan's
China Air Lines (CAL) said they rejected for a second time a proposal
from the Communist side that CAL send a delegation to Guangzhou,
formerly Canton, in southern China, to recover the Boeing 747 and the
crew members.
The CAL representatives said they rejected the Communist proposal
because they feared for their safety in Guangzhou.
The Hong Kong Standard newspaper called the talks "jumbo
diplomacy" that could mark the start of a complex and difficult process
of reunification of China and Taiwan.
Some people in Taiwan consider the talks a test of China's long-term
intentions toward Taiwan.
Foreign diplomats said both sides were under pressure to act reason
ably in the talks — China because it wants to appear capable of carrying
on more substantive negotiations later and Taiwan because public
opinion there strongly favors making every effort to get back the plane's
crew members stranded on the mainland.

Contras kidnap 8 West Germans
BONN, West Germany — The West German government formed a
crisis team yesterday to help seek the release of eight West Germans ab
ducted by anti-government guerrillas in Nicaragua.
A government spokesman said the West German embassies in the
United States, Nicaragua and Honduras had been instructed to seek the
release of the Germans, who were seized from an agricultural project
Friday.
The spokesman said contact had already been established with the
kidnappers, members of the U.S.-financed Democratic Force of
Nicaragua.
A group of about 30 rebels, known as contras, seized the West Ger
mans in the village of Yacinto Vac, about 215 miles north of Managua,
the Nicaraguan capital.
They belonged to a group of 12 West German volunteers who had
arrived only two weeks before to work on an agricultural construction
project.
Four members of the group managed to escape after a government pa
trol challenged the guerrillas. A Nicaraguan spokesman said one of the
West Germans was injured in the shoot out.
The remaining eight captives were taken towards the Honduran bor
der.
Last year, a group of contras kidnapped a West German woman and
later released her in Honduras.
China, Taiwan airline talks stalled
HONG KONG — Unprecedented airline talks between China and
Taiwan seemed to reach a deadlock yesterday over the question of how
to return the Taiwanese jumbo jet cargo plane that has been in China,
along with two crew members, ever since the pilot flew it there two
weeks ago to defect.
After a second day of negotiations, representatives from Taiwan's
China Air Lines (CAL) said they rejected for a second time a proposal
from the Communist side that CAL send a delegation to Guangzhou,
formerly Canton, in southern China, to recover the Boeing 747 and the
crew members.
The CAL representatives said they rejected the Communist proposal
because they feared for their safety in Guangzhou.
The Hong Kong Standard newspaper called the talks "jumbo
diplomacy" that could mark the start of a complex and difficult process
of reunification of China and Taiwan.
Some people in Taiwan consider the talks a test of China's long-term
intentions toward Taiwan.
Foreign diplomats said both sides were under pressure to act reason
ably in the talks — China because it wants to appear capable of carrying
on more substantive negotiations later and Taiwan because public
opinion there strongly favors making every effort to get back the plane's
crew members stranded on the mainland.
