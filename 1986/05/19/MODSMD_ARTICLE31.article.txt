# Doctor reports on victims

### 
LOS ANGELES and MOSCOW
— Dr. Robert Gale, head of a team of
Western doctors helping victims of
the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, said
yesterday that as many as 100,000
Soviets may have suffered radiation
doses with long-term health effects.
Gale, a UCLA specialist in using
bone-marrow transplants to treat ra
diation and leukemia victims, said So
viet and foreign doctors expect to
monitor residents of the Chernobyl
area for several years to see whether
cancers or other diseases associated
with radiation appear in unusual
numbers.
"I expect we will be returning there
at 3- to 6-month intervals for the next
several years," Gale told reporters at
UCLA Medical Center.
Gale returned here Friday night
after two weeks in Moscow and said
he plans to return to Moscow next
Friday.
"There are about 50,000 to
100,000 individuals who have
received at least some dose (of radia
tion) that may be of long-term con
cern," he said, adding that he has
volunteered to visit the Chernobyl
area.
Of about 300 radiation victims
brought to Moscow Hospital No. 6,
Gale said, he and his team helped
treat the 35 with severe radiation ex
posure. Nineteen of them have been
given marrow or other transplants,
and 1 1 of the 35 have died, bringing

the death toll to 13. Gale said more
will die.
Meanwhile, the Soviet media for
the first time acknowledged yesterday
that a delay in releasing information
about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster
led to widespread public anxiety in
the Soviet Union.
Pravda, the official organ of the
Communist Party, said the experi
ence should prove to be a lesson for
the future.
The Soviet Union waited almost
three full days to admit that an acci
dent horl occurred April 26 at Cher

nobyl, and it provided only terse gov
ernment bulletins for a week after
that.
Pravda published a front-page
report from Kiev, 60 miles south of
Chernobyl, which focused on the ini
tial lack of information.
In the first days, shifts in people's
moods came from uncertainty that
was sometimes promoted by belated
information on the real state of affairs
at the site of the accident.
Western diplomats have said that
the policy of silence, in stark contrast
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's

support for greater openness in public
affairs, severely damaged the Krem
lin's prestige.
The article from Kiev said there
were "whirlpools of hysterical, selfish
individuals" at train stations where
thousands of persons, mainly women
and children, were leaving the Uk
rainian capital.
But it insisted that there was no
general panic during an exodus that
involved dozens of extra trains and
planes.
Meantime, the official news agency
TASS accused West German Chan
cellor Helmut Kohl with impudence
for asking the Soviet Union to pay
compensation because of the Cher
nobyl accident.
In a speech in Munich, Kohl
criticized Gorbachev's failure to raise
the compensation issue in his speech
on Soviet television last Wednesday.
West Germany plans to com
pensate farmers who were prohibited
by the government as a precautionary
measure from selling their products
after cloud of radiation from Cher
nobyl drifted over much of Europe.
The Agriculture Ministry in Bonn
has said the program was expected to
cost about $90 million. Wolfgang von
Geldern, a high-ranking ministry offi
cial, has been quoted as saying West
Germany would take its case to the
International Court of Justice in The
Hague if Moscow refuses to pay.
