# S. African whites welcomed

### 
ALEXANDRA, South Africa — More than 300
white South Africans defied police orders barring
them from this riot-torn black township near
Johannesburg and received a tumultuous welcome
from its residents yesterday when they came to lay
flowers on the graves of victims of recent civil
strife.
Thousands of black residents lined Alexandra's
rutted streets in welcome, cheering the whites and
saluting them with raised fists.
The white defiance of the police ban was a bold
demonstration of liberal white support for South
Africa's black majority in its drive against apart
heid.
"We are sad and angry that what brings us here is
the unnecessary and criminal deaths of fellow
South Africans," one of the white organizers, Mor
ris Smithers of the Johannesburg Democratic Ac
tion Committee, said in a short ceremony at the
Alexandra cemetery where eight unrest victims
were buried Saturday. "These fallen comrades will

never live in a free South Africa, but their sacrifice
has helped ensure that future generations will."
To shouts of "Power to the people!" and other
anti-apartheid slogans, Smithers said the whites
had come "as conscious and willing partners in the
struggle for fundamental change in South Africa."
When a caravan of more than 30 minibuses and
cars carrying the whites arrived at the outskirts of
the segregated township yesterday afternoon,
police prohibited them from proceeding under laws
restricting entry to urban black areas. Organizers
went from vehicle to vehicle, consulting the pas
sengers, and then informed the police that every
one was prepared to be arrested, risking a six
month jail sentence and $250 fine.
Avoiding a further confrontation, the police
withdrew, regrouping on a hillside above the
township cemetery. They did not interfere with the
brief ceremony at the cemetery except to fire two
canisters of tear gas to disperse participants after
the ceremony ended. Two of the organizers were

arrested, one for entering the township in defiance
of the police order and the other on charges of
obstructing a police camera crew photographing
the demonstration's participants.
Meanwhile, an opinion survey published yester
day in Rapport, an Afrikaans-language newspaper,
indicated that whites have become more flexible in
the last five years about opening some now
segregated neighborhoods and schools to other
races.
The number of whites who approve of local op
tions in decisions on racial integration has in
creased from 36.6 percent to 53.6 percent, the sur
vey showed, but most remain opposed to a com
plete end to segregated schools and residential
areas.
The proportion opposed to any school integra
tion declined from 48 percent to 35 percent, ac
cording to the survey, and those favoring the
opening of all schools to all races rose from 11 per
cent to 24 percent.
