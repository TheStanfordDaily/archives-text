Taxpayers may be ready
WASHINGTON — The Republican chairman
of the National Governors Association said yes
terday that he believes taxpayers are ready to pay
skilled teachers "50, 60, $70,000 a year" to im
prove the performance of U.S schools and the
productivity of their graduates.
"People know their paychecks are going down
if our schools don't get better, and that they will
have to pay to have super teachers in the class
rooms for their children," said Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander, who heads the association's
education project.
Noting the intensity of recent competition by
other nations, among them Japan and South
Korea, which have surpassed U.S. literacy stand
ards, Alexander said the nation's governors "are
ready to push" at their annual meeting in August
for the sweeping educational reforms recom

mended in a report released Thursday in San
Diego by the Carnegie Forum on Education and
the Economy.
Secretary of Education William Bennett, ap
pearing with Alexander on the NBC program
"Meet the Press/' joined in endorsing the thrust
of the report.
Even as they supported the report's goals, both
officials cautioned that chances of putting them
into practice will depend heavily on the reactions
of the nation's leading teachers' unions, both of
which were represented on the program by offi
cials who served on the 14-member task force
that drew up the report.
Mary Futrell, president of the National Educa
tion Association, the nation's largest teachers'
organization with 1.7 million members, said she
signed the report even though it recommends
some steps the NEA opposes, among them merit
pay for accomplished teachers.

Albert Shanker, president of the 610,000-
member American Federation of Teachers, said
the report's recommendation that there be na
tional standards for teachers would not require
creation of a new bureaucracy to certify teachers.
Both teacher representatives endorsed in prin
ciple suggestions that the two unions be merged.
Train derails in Virginia
