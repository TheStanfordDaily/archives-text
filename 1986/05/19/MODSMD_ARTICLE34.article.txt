SF race draws 85,000
SAN FRANCISCO— Ed Eyestone and Grete
Waitz, newcomers to the strange world of the San
Francisco Examiner Bay to Breakers race, led a
festive, costumed crowd of 85.000 in chilly fog
yesterday to win the giant running party in record
times.
Eyestone, the 1985 world cross-country cham
pion, stripped more than 20 seconds off the
record of two-time defending champion Ibrahim
Hussein. Eyestone covered the hilly, 7.46 mile
(12 kilometer) course in 34 minutes, 32.5
seconds, well ahead of Hussein's previous record
of 34:53.3 set last year.
Waitz, the 1984 Olympic marathon silver
medalist behind Joan Benoit, easily defeated
Benoit. the defending champion, to capture the
women's division in the 75th annual running of
the world's oldest continuous foot race.
Waitz finished in 38.40.5, just ahead of the Cal
Aggies centipede, to shatter Benoit's record last
year of 39:54.8. Benoit finished second among
the women in 39:09.8, with Australia's Lisa Mar
tin third at 40:13.6.
The Cal Aggies won the centipede division in
38:51.5.
Eyestone's fellow Brigham Young alumnus,
Paul Cummings of Orem, Utah, finished second
in 35:32.5. Mark Curp was third in 35:33.9.
Waitz, 32. of Norway, led Benoit most of the
way and was never challenged over the final few
miles.

Benoit said the difference between her victory
last year and second place this year was simply
that "Grete was in the field. She ran a spectacular
race.
"I just didn't have what it took," said Benoit.
who had been bothered by a sore Achilles ten
don.
Benoit, 29, won last year in 39:54.8, the best
women's American time ever for I 2 kilometers.
Although many of the world's top marathon
and cross-country runners took the race
seriously, thousands of other participants joined
in just for the fun of it. They came from around
the world for the event, this fitness-conscious
city's version of Mardi Gras.
Nancy Ditz, the 1984 Breakers champion and
1986 Los Angeles Marathon winner, ran in a sil
ver top hat and costume this time. Centipede
entries of 13 runners tied together included a
group carrying a Humphrey the Whale costume
and another in a huge hamburger.
Sheriffs deputies shot
LOS ANGELES — Two sheriffs deputies
were injured early yesterday when at least eight
people barricaded themselves in a Lennox house
and fought off sheriffs sharpshooters, officials
said.
Four people, including one wearing a federal
agent's jumpsuit, were booked for investigation
of attempted murder, sheriffs Sgt. Ron Bailey

said.
One deputy's face was grazed by a shotgun pel
let. and another deputy was treated for powder
burns to his face, said Deputy Sam Jones. He
withheld their names.
A SWAT team was called to the house on
Condon Avenue around 3 a.m. yesterday at the
report of a fight, Jones said, adding that up to
eight people were inside.
When the team arrived, a man outside told
deputies he was conducting a drug raid, Jones
said.
The man was standing by a sedan with govern
ment license plates, and looked to be wearing a
badge from the state Department of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, Jones said.
"He had the jumpsuit of an ATF agent,"
Bailey said, adding that investigators were check
ing to see if the car or plates were stolen.
Jones said deputies checked with ATF agents
and determined there was no scheduled raid.
Besides the man with the car, three people
inside the house were booked for investigation of
attempted murder, Bailey said, but their names
were not immediately released.
Fog in the throat

row, becoming mostly sunny and breezy this af

with chance of drizzle in the early morning.

Sheriffs deputies shot
LOS ANGELES — Two sheriffs deputies
were injured early yesterday when at least eight
people barricaded themselves in a Lennox house
and fought off sheriffs sharpshooters, officials
said.
Four people, including one wearing a federal
agent's jumpsuit, were booked for investigation
of attempted murder, sheriffs Sgt. Ron Bailey

said.
One deputy's face was grazed by a shotgun pel
let. and another deputy was treated for powder
burns to his face, said Deputy Sam Jones. He
withheld their names.
A SWAT team was called to the house on
Condon Avenue around 3 a.m. yesterday at the
report of a fight, Jones said, adding that up to
eight people were inside.
When the team arrived, a man outside told
deputies he was conducting a drug raid, Jones
said.
The man was standing by a sedan with govern
ment license plates, and looked to be wearing a
badge from the state Department of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, Jones said.
"He had the jumpsuit of an ATF agent,"
Bailey said, adding that investigators were check
ing to see if the car or plates were stolen.
Jones said deputies checked with ATF agents
and determined there was no scheduled raid.
Besides the man with the car, three people
inside the house were booked for investigation of
attempted murder, Bailey said, but their names
were not immediately released.
