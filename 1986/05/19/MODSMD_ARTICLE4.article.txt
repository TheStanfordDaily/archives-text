They started to build it Saturday around noon, ham
mering together cardboard boxes and scraps of old fruit
crates.
Three hours later, the group of about 12 Branner Hall
residents had constructed the first shanty in front of a
Stanford dormitory.
The shanty, built in protest of the racist government of
South Africa and the University's South African holdings,
was the brainchild of Branner resident Bobbi Bernstein.
Bernstein said she was inspired to build the shanty
partly because of her political science course on civil
rights. "In front of Branner, it would be a symbol of dorm
action," she said. "In the Quad, it would just he another
shantytown."
She said she hopes to have Branner residents sitting by
the shanty every day to distribute information about
apartheid and divestment.
"We're not hoping that our little shantytown will make
Stanford divest, but we are hoping it will make a lot of
people think about the issue and learn about the issue."
Bernstein said.
Bernstein said she hoped to make the Branner residents
Ihink about the issue two weeks ago when she distributed
in the dorm fliers that called for the construction of the
building. At an April 7 house meeting, the residents ap
proved the shanty by a 52-21 vote, she said.
Bernstein said she hopes other residences will follow
Branner's action.
But there are "definitely individuals who are opposed
to (the shanty)," according to Neal Lintecum. a resident
assistant at Branner.
