# Frosh construct shanty at Branner
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
They started to build it Saturday around noon, ham
mering together cardboard boxes and scraps of old fruit
crates.
Three hours later, the group of about 12 Branner Hall
residents had constructed the first shanty in front of a
Stanford dormitory.
The shanty, built in protest of the racist government of
South Africa and the University's South African holdings,
was the brainchild of Branner resident Bobbi Bernstein.
Bernstein said she was inspired to build the shanty
partly because of her political science course on civil
rights. "In front of Branner, it would be a symbol of dorm
action," she said. "In the Quad, it would just he another
shantytown."
She said she hopes to have Branner residents sitting by
the shanty every day to distribute information about
apartheid and divestment.
"We're not hoping that our little shantytown will make
Stanford divest, but we are hoping it will make a lot of
people think about the issue and learn about the issue."
Bernstein said.
Bernstein said she hoped to make the Branner residents
Ihink about the issue two weeks ago when she distributed
in the dorm fliers that called for the construction of the
building. At an April 7 house meeting, the residents ap
proved the shanty by a 52-21 vote, she said.
Bernstein said she hopes other residences will follow
Branner's action.
But there are "definitely individuals who are opposed
to (the shanty)," according to Neal Lintecum. a resident
assistant at Branner.

outside of Branner Hall on Saturday.
"You don't convince anyone of
your opinions by insulting their
senses," he said, adding that those
who opposed the building of the
shanty felt that "their time and effort
could have been spent on something
with direct results."
Lintecum said that the residents
opposed to the project said that in
stead of carrying on a debate, the
builders of the shanty were "just
building shanties."
But Branner residents working on
the project stressed the importance of
a dorm having its own shanty.
"I think it will accomplish a sense
that it is not enough for a small group
of individuals to make a statement in
the Inner Quad," freshman Greg
Siegler said. "Everybody on campus
has to take part and say what they
feel."
He called the shanty "a small proj
ect for us, but a grand achievement
for the Stanford community as a
whole."
Freshmen Julie Lythcott said the
shanty makes a statement to people
walking and driving by the dormitory.
"All I'm interested in is letting
people know that there is a group of
people in Branner protesting apart
heid. When people drive by, I want
them to know that we're calling for an
end to apartheid," Lythcott said.
