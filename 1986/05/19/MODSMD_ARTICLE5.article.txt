"Dear Gentlemen and Gentlewomen,
Congratulations on the Swanson Company's
latest achievement, the newly refurbished
Chicken Pot Pie. . .
For those of you who might recall, this let
ter, along with a cut-up picture of a chicken
pot pie, adorned the cover of last quarter's

issue of Dial Tone, a Stanford student maga
zine that reputes itself to be "free but not
cheap."
Dial Tone, according to staff member Jen
Hill, a senior, "is whatever the people in
volved want it to be." Last quarter's issue
contained works of fiction, poetry, art. pho
tography and interviews. The magazine, ac
cording to Hill, does not conform with any
one idea and is mainly a forum for student
work. Its aim, according to staff member Mi
chael Hawley, also a senior, is "good writing
and good art" with an emphasis on quality.
Contributors to Dial Tone usually have
some affiliation with Stanford, said Hawley.

Sometimes, according to Hawley, "we'll ask
someone to write for us." Otherwise, Dial
Tone has a box in the English department for
submissions.
"We are looking for people who have
something to write about," said Hawley,
"because Dial Tone doesn't assign topics."
Added staff member and senior Chris Hill.
"No image is being forced on the writing. . . .
We want people writing about things inter
esting to them."
Dial Tone has been around for six to seven
years, according to Hawley, but with few
continuing members and issues. Said
Hawley, "It goes in fits and starts." The
group doesn't have regular meetings, but
works on the issue throughout the quarter, to
be "put together in a fury at the end," said
Hawley.
Dial Tone sees itself as "filling a gap in
publications," said Jen Hill. It is a free
publication which is interested in high
quality work. "Why should we make it exclu
sive (by charging money) when it's for
everybody?" she added.
Said Chris Hill, "If you start charging, you
start limiting your audience and it is those
people who wouldn't ordinarily buy such a

Feature
magazine that I'm more interested in
reaching."
Because of the informal nature of
the group, there are no specific staff
positions, noted Hawley. Usually the
staff has consisted of a core group of
four to five people. Responsibility,
according to staff member Pierre
Valette, also a senior, has been
"passed on" to friends who have been
freshmen or sophomores.

To pay for such a publication, Dial
Tone receives funding from the
ASSU publications board. Depart
ments such as English, Creative
Writing, Histoiy and the Humanities
Honor Program have also given
money, said Hawley. Over 3,000
copies of the issue were published last
quarter and distributed all over
campus. "We had a good response to
the last issue," said Hawley.
Dial Tone plans to put out another
issue this quarter in June. Anyone in
terested in submitting their work
should contact one of the staff mem
bers.
