# Native Americans celebrate, recall traditions at powwow
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN 
Just another weekend party? No, this one included
native American dancing, tacos and beadwork.
The 15th Annual Stanford Powwow was "the biggest
celebration we've ever had," said senior Debbie Phillips,
one of the coordinators of the event.
Opening Friday evening, the powwow continued
through last night on an intramural field near Stanford
Stadium.
The powwow is unique because it is one of the few
events that brings the Stanford native American commu
nity together, according to student director Nancy
Jemison.
The Stanford powwow attracts native Americans from
all over the United States and Canada, according to Shir
ley Waterhouse, last year's powwow director.
Waterhouse added that generous prize money for dance
competitions attracts many.
"Each year it gets bigger," she said.
The Stanford powwow is one of the first on the pow
wow circuit and the first annually in California.
"The California people expect us to put on a good
one," said sophomore Wes Williams, a member of the
staff that organized and coordinated the powwow.
According to Waterhouse, the events went smoothly
except for one incident in which a sound system failure
delayed a grand entrance by half-an-hour.
A small group of undergraduates completed most of the
work before and during the powwow. The group raised
more than $20,000 from various academic departments
and residential education programs.

"I think it's really incredible that they do it themselves
with very little support from the (Stanlord) administra
tion," Jemison said.
Jemison said she liked the fact that the powwow unified
students in a constructive way, rather than in a destructive
effort such as the anti-apartheid movement.
The best thing about the powwow, Jemison said, was
"just having so many Indians from all over come (to the
event)."
"People here know relatives of mine from upstate New
York. It also gives the Indian alumni an excuse to come
back."
The dance contests included children's, men sand
women's competitions. The Northern and Southern
Traditional and the more fast-paced Fancy Dance were
featured in the men's and women's contests.
The Southern dancers, from states such as Oklahoma,
Nebraska and Kansas, are known more for fast footwork,
while the Northern dancers from Wyoming, Idaho,
Oregon, the Dakotas and Canada are noted tor more
body movement and creativity.
The Owl Dance Contest honors the native American
woman in her roles as giver of life and head of the
household, Waterhouse said.
In this dance, the woman chooses a dance partner and,
if she is married, her husband cannot show jealousy.
The Men's Fancy Dance, the most colorful and popular
of the dancing events, is historically performed by men
going and returning from war.
In addition to the dancing, the powwow featured tradi
tional native American food, ornaments, clothing and
books that were sold at nearby booths.
