## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
The S;anford chapter of Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity has been
named the most outstanding or
ganization of that fraternity in the
United States and Canada.
The Dekes beat out the 69 other
chapters to win the Lion Trophy,
which will be awarded in a cere
mony on campus in the fall. The
trophy, however, will remain in
the national chapter headquarters
in New York because of its value.
The competition was based on
four areas. The Stanford chapter
finished first in academic achieve
ment and in chapter improvement,
and tied for third in alumni rela
tions. The Stanford Dekes did not
place in the community service
category.

House members maintain a 3.3
grade-point average, according to
former chapter president Mike
Gordon, who completed the
reports to the national chapter on
which the decision was based.
Gordon said Stanford DKE
members were "exuberant" about
winning the award and are looking
forward to traveling to Austin,
Texas, in December to attend the
national conference where they
will be recognized.
This is the first time the Sigma
Rho chapter has won the award.
The chapter was named most im
proved in 1980, according to Gor
don.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
Student Affairs, was among those
who sent letters of recommenda
tion in favor of the Stanford chap
ter, he said. Conklin could not be
reached last night for comment.
