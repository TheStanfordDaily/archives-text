Attention All Staffers
Here's your big chance. Today at noon, meet the candidates for editor in chief of
Vol. 190 — Tracy Furutani, Allison Hartwell, Peter Haven and Mark Lawrence —
at that twice-a-year delight, the grill session. You bring your questions, Beth will
bring your lunch. Afterward, stick around to vote for the candidate of your choice.
Polls close at 10 p.m., with the results announced shortly thereafter. A runoff, if
necessary, will be held tomorrow. That is all.
