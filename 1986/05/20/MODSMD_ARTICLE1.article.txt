### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas â€” Cari Hagey had lost her singles
match and Stephanie Savides had not won a match all
week, hut the pair combined for the biggest doubles win
of their careers yesterday to clinch Stanford's team victory
here at the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships.
The top-seeded Cardinal edged the No. 2 Trojans 5-4
in a classic final before a large crowd at the Penick-Allison
Tennis Center.
"I'm really proud," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I really thought in my heart that we were the better
team, but I didn't know if we were going to win or lose. It
happened to be us."
The Cardinal led 4-2 after the singles but had to
withstand a tremendous USC doubles charge. The match
was not decided until Savides and Hagey edged the
Trojans' No. 2 doubles team 6-4, 7-5.
"They (USC) never gave up." Brennan said. "That's

the sign of a great team. I think it (yesterday's match) was
the epitome of great competition."
"We played tough, and we didn't quit," USC Coach
Dave Borelli said. "They were the better team."
The Trojans looked like the better team after the first
two matches. Mary Norwood defeated Savides 6-2, 6-1 in
the No. 4 singles, and Claudia Hernandez upset Hagey 6-
4, 6-2 in the No. 6 singles to give USC a 2-0 lead.
"I felt Stephanie probably wouldn't be able to do it be
cause she wasn't playing well," Brennan said.
"Norwoood's a little tough on Stephanie."
Whereas Savides was not supposed to win. Hagey was,
but didn't.
"Cari really thought she was going to win," Brennan
said. "Hernandez played real well.
Neither Hagey nor Hernandez could hold her serve in
the first set, but the USC freshman did when it counted in
the 10th game to take the set 6-4.
The second set saw Hernandez break the Cardinal
sophomore twice to win 6-2.

USC's momentum was halted quickly by the Cardinal's
top three singles players. Patty Fendick, Marianne Werdel
and Leigh Anne Eldredge overpowered the Trojans in
straight sets.
Werdel traded baseline bombs with USC's Heliane
Steden in the first set of the No. 2 singles match. At 5-4 in
the set and 3-3 in the 10th game. Werdel broke Steden's
serve to capture the set.
The Cardinal freshman continued her groundstroke
barrage in the second set. and Steden could not respond.
Werdel overwhelmed the Trojan senior 6-1 to take the
match.
"Steden's a carbon copy of Marianne, but Marianne's
just a little better at it," Brennan said.
The No. 3 singles match between Eldredge and Maeve
Ouinlan started as a push as Quinlan played much better
than she had earlier in the tournament.
"1 wasn't too worried because Quinlan usually plays a
good first set, and Leigh Anne doesn't," Brennan said. "1
knew if we won the first set, we'd be fine."

Eldredge did win the first set by breaking Quintan at 5-
4. A frustrated Quinlan was no match for the Cardinal
junior in the second set, and Eldredge closed out the
match 6-0.
The final two singles matches were the most exciting
and, as it turned out, the most crucial.
The No. I singles drew the most attention as Fendick
ended Caroline Kuhlman's remarkable undefeated streak.
The USC sophomore entered the match at 30-0 and hold
ing the nation's No. I singles ranking, but Fendick beat
her easily 7-5, 6-2.
Kuhlman defeated Fendick twice during the regular
season, but the Stanford junior waited until the most im
portant match of the year to collect her revenge.
"I think the first time she played too softly, the second
time she hit the ball way too hard and this time she found
the right balance," Brennan said. "Caroline's the best
player in college, but when you win all the time, you're
