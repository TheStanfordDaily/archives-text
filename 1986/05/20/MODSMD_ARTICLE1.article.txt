## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas â€” Cari Hagey had lost her singles
match and Stephanie Savides had not won a match all
week, hut the pair combined for the biggest doubles win
of their careers yesterday to clinch Stanford's team victory
here at the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships.
The top-seeded Cardinal edged the No. 2 Trojans 5-4
in a classic final before a large crowd at the Penick-Allison
Tennis Center.
"I'm really proud," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "I really thought in my heart that we were the better
team, but I didn't know if we were going to win or lose. It
happened to be us."
The Cardinal led 4-2 after the singles but had to
withstand a tremendous USC doubles charge. The match
was not decided until Savides and Hagey edged the
Trojans' No. 2 doubles team 6-4, 7-5.
"They (USC) never gave up." Brennan said. "That's

the sign of a great team. I think it (yesterday's match) was
the epitome of great competition."
"We played tough, and we didn't quit," USC Coach
Dave Borelli said. "They were the better team."
The Trojans looked like the better team after the first
two matches. Mary Norwood defeated Savides 6-2, 6-1 in
the No. 4 singles, and Claudia Hernandez upset Hagey 6-
4, 6-2 in the No. 6 singles to give USC a 2-0 lead.
"I felt Stephanie probably wouldn't be able to do it be
cause she wasn't playing well," Brennan said.
"Norwoood's a little tough on Stephanie."
Whereas Savides was not supposed to win. Hagey was,
but didn't.
"Cari really thought she was going to win," Brennan
said. "Hernandez played real well.
Neither Hagey nor Hernandez could hold her serve in
the first set, but the USC freshman did when it counted in
the 10th game to take the set 6-4.
The second set saw Hernandez break the Cardinal
sophomore twice to win 6-2.

USC's momentum was halted quickly by the Cardinal's
top three singles players. Patty Fendick, Marianne Werdel
and Leigh Anne Eldredge overpowered the Trojans in
straight sets.
Werdel traded baseline bombs with USC's Heliane
Steden in the first set of the No. 2 singles match. At 5-4 in
the set and 3-3 in the 10th game. Werdel broke Steden's
serve to capture the set.
The Cardinal freshman continued her groundstroke
barrage in the second set. and Steden could not respond.
Werdel overwhelmed the Trojan senior 6-1 to take the
match.
"Steden's a carbon copy of Marianne, but Marianne's
just a little better at it," Brennan said.
The No. 3 singles match between Eldredge and Maeve
Ouinlan started as a push as Quinlan played much better
than she had earlier in the tournament.
"1 wasn't too worried because Quinlan usually plays a
good first set, and Leigh Anne doesn't," Brennan said. "1
knew if we won the first set, we'd be fine."

Eldredge did win the first set by breaking Quintan at 5-
4. A frustrated Quinlan was no match for the Cardinal
junior in the second set, and Eldredge closed out the
match 6-0.
The final two singles matches were the most exciting
and, as it turned out, the most crucial.
The No. I singles drew the most attention as Fendick
ended Caroline Kuhlman's remarkable undefeated streak.
The USC sophomore entered the match at 30-0 and hold
ing the nation's No. I singles ranking, but Fendick beat
her easily 7-5, 6-2.
Kuhlman defeated Fendick twice during the regular
season, but the Stanford junior waited until the most im
portant match of the year to collect her revenge.
"I think the first time she played too softly, the second
time she hit the ball way too hard and this time she found
the right balance," Brennan said. "Caroline's the best
player in college, but when you win all the time, you're
bound to lose," Borelli said.
"I figured she had to lose to some
body," Fendick said. "Why not me?"
Kuhlman won the first two games
of the match, but Fendick refused to
back down.
"We were both really nervous to
start with," Fendick said. "I just had
a feeling I was going to work out of it
first."
Fendick broke Kuhlman at 6-5 to
take the first set and never let her
back in the match. "The wind started
to get worse," Fendick said. "For
some rea-son 1 knew I had her. I grew
up in the wind, and I love it."
At 5-2 in the second set, Fendick
won four straight points off of
Kuhlman's serve to take the match.
"I was expecting a fight and it never
happened," Fendick said. "She
started getting mad. She had never
done that before."
With the team score 3-2, the No. 5
singles match between Stanford's Kay
Tittle and USC's Ginny Purdy took
on tremendous significance. A Card
inal victory would force the Trojans
to sweep the doubles to win. A USC
win would even the match.
Tittle had taken the first set 6-3,
but Purdy rallied to grab the second
by the same score.
When Purdy won the first two
games of the decisive set, it appeared
that USC would get its singles split.
Tittle, however, saved her best tennis
for the remainder of the set.
"1 love to have her (Tittle) be the
last singles match," Brennan said
later.
Title broke Purdy twice to take a 4-
2 lead, but the USC freshman was
not rattled. She broke Tittle to edge
within 4-3, only to sec Tittle break
back to 5-3.
After Purdy took her turn breaking
serve to cut the lead to 5-4, Tittle
moved to match point on Purdy's
serve with a forehand winner down
the line. The next point. Tittle ap
proached the net following a short
ball and hit a cross-court volley to se
cure the match and give the Cardinal
a 4-2 team lead.
"Kay was really good today,"
Brennan said. "You don't realize how
difficult it is for someone her size to
come in and volley.
"Usually in the No. 5 matches, the
one-trick pony wins," he added. "She
(Tittle) really kept coming in and
coming in."
"The match with Purdy and Tittle
was the most important," Borelli

said. "I thought Kay played really
well."
In both of the earlier matches be
tween USC and Stanford, the Trojans
had won two of the three doubles, but
this time they would have to be per
fect.
"I felt pretty confident about
doubles," Borelli said. "But psyc
hologically, it's very difficult to win
all three."
The Trojans almost pulled it off.
Brennan figured his No. 1 team of
Fendick and Eldredge was favored to
beat Kuhlman and Dena Levy, and
the beginning of the first set was tes
timony to his belief. The Stanford

pair broke out to a 5-2 lead and ap
peared ready to clinch the team vic
tory.
Then the roof caved in. Kuhlman
and Levy won 1 1 of the next 13
games to take the match, 7-5, 6-2 and
revive USCs hopes of winning the
title.
"They (Kuhlman and Levy) can be
had, but we haven't been able to get
close to them," Brennan said. "They
match up well with us."
The happenings in the other two
doubles matches gave Stanford
rooters reason to fret. Playing at No.
3 singles, Werdel and Tittle had been
expected to beat Quinlan and Purdy,

but the USC duo won the first set 6-3
and was up 4-0 in the second.
In the No. 2 doubles, Savides and
Hagey won the first set 6-4 but were
even in the second, 3-3.
"1 was trying not to look (at the
other matches)," Hagey said. "As
soon as I heard Patty yelling, I knew
we were in trouble. At one point, I
realized we had to win."
Through they had each lost singles
matches earlier, Savides and Hagey
were confident they would win in
doubles. "I was psyched," Hagey
said.
Savides hit a forehand winner past
Norwood, and the Cardinal had a ser
vice break and a 4-3 lead in the
second set. Both teams then held
serve, and Savides attempted to serve
out the set.
With the score 3-3 in the 10th
game, Savides netted a volley and the
Trojans pulled even at 5-5. "I knew
we were still going to win," she said
later.
In the crucial 11th game, both
Savides and Hagey came on strong.
Savides slammed a short Norwood
second serve into Steden's body to
give the Cardinal a 6-5 lead.
"You know they're going to win
when they refuse to lose the 1 Ith
game," Brennan said. "That's the
type of spirit you need to have."
As Hagey was preparing to serve
for the match, Werdel and Tittle were
staging a remarkable comeback in the
No. 3 match. After trailing 4-0 in the
second set, they came back to win 7-
5.
"If we would have that, it would
have put more pressure on," Borelli
said.
Savides and Hagey said afterward
that they were not aware of their
teammates' rally, but Brennan said it
was significant nevertheless. Had the
No. 3 team lost, all of the pressure
and attention would have shifted to
the No. 2 match.
"Whereas Kay revels in the
hooting and hollering, I don't think
Cari and Stephanie do," Brennan
said.
Despite the fact that the No. 3
match was still being played, most
eyes were on Savides and Hagey to
see if they could clinch.
With the score 3-1 in the 12th
game, Norwood and Steden fought
off two match points to even the
game. Hagey's next serve, however,
was returned out. and the Cardinal
celebration commenced as Fcndick

and Eldredge raced onto the court to
congratulate their teammates.
"You want everybody to get a
piece of the pie, and for Stephanie to

be the hero is great," Brennan said,
referring to Savides' trouble through
out the tournament in singles.
"You can't lose faith in people," he
added. "Credit really has to go to
Stephanie."
"We knew it mattered so much,"

Hagey said. "We wanted so much to
win to contribute."
"It was definitely a sanity-saving
match," Savides said.
The No. 3 doubles match was
