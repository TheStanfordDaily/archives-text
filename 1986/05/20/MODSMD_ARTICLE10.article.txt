# Wells Fargo gives to GSB
## 
### 
Wells Fargo has pledged $1 million toward the
remodeling of the student lounge in the Graduate
School of Business in honor of Ernest and Kat
herine Arbuckle, the school's former dean and his
wife.
The Arbuckles were killed in an automobile acci
dent near Monterey in January. As dean of the
school from 1958 to 1968, Arbuckle was widely
credited as the key to the school's surge to interna
tional prominence.
Arbuckle served as chairman of Wells Fargo's
board from 1968 until he retired in 1978, and con
tinued to serve as a director until 1983.
Remodeling work on what will be called the
Ernest and Katherine Arbuckle Student Center will
begin in June
