# PacBell may have to reach out and pay

Telephone customers will be offered refunds for op
tional services they bought and now say they never
wanted or for deposits they were wrongly required to pay,
according to Pacific Bell.
For students at Stanford, that could mean a refund for
any service they had ordered at the beginning of the year
when they were not adequately informed of the option of
an $8.25 monthly minimum service level.
The proposal was announced Friday in hopes of war
ding off state penalties for abusive sales practices that
were discovered by the state Public Utilities Commission
(PUC).
As of yet there have been " no huge numbers of custom
ers calling Pacific" for refunds, according to Lou Saviano,
media relations manager at Pacific Bell.
"Whatever the customer request is ... we will accept,"

said Rae Haight, the phone company's vice president in
charge of residential service and marketing.
A staff report by the Public Utilities Commission found
that many phone customers were being charged for
services they hadn't ordered, were misled or pressured
into buying expensive optional services, were not being
told about available low-cost services or were improperly
required to pay deposits.
At Stanford, many students were not completely in
formed by Pacific Bell about the $8.25-a-month charge
available to them. The students chose a higher price op
tion with services they did not need because of the lack of
information.
Stanford's Residential Education Office was informed
by students that the promotion package from Pacific Bell
did not include or make clear all the options.
"We felt we needed to inform our students of all possi
ble options," said Alice Supton, assistant dean of Student
Affairs. Orientation packages last fall contained a flier

from Res Ed explaining the additional options.
"There will definitely be a list of all charges in the
future," Saviano said. "We want all students to know their
full range of possibilities."
The PUC will decide soon whether to order Pacific Bell
to change its marketing practices and implement a refund
program or to accept the company's argument that it can
make the changes and refunds on its own.
The improper practices stemmed partly from changes
after the breakup of the nationwide Bell system in 1983-
84, according to Haight. "We needed to generate addi
tional revenues from optional services," she said
"We (Pacific Bell) have the ultimate responsibility in
the mistakes," Saviano said.
All sales representatives have been retrained, promo
tional information contains a breakdown of all services
available, and letters will be sent to customers in the
future to explain what services they have ordered, he said.
Pacific Bell has not yet determined when the refunds
will be mailed to customers.
