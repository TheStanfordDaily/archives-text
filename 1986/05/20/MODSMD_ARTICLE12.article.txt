The Western Culture Program was introduced in
1980 with the intention of giving freshmen an overview
of our culture's history, values and beliefs, as well as an
understanding of the origins of this country's social,
political and economic systems. It is no ordinary distri
bution requirement. Western Culture is a three
quarter sequence required of every student at Stan
ford, an introduction to university-level education and
to the "major works and historical movements that
have shaped Western Civilization."
The program, however, has received much criticism
from students and faculty who are concerned that it
presents an ethnocentric view of Western society. They
believe that the texts and the way in which they are
presented omit the experiences of women and non-
Europeans and their influence on Western Culture.
Many students and faculty strongly believe that the
Western Culture Program should be re-evaluated and
changed, and the Black Student Union has presented a
proposal for restructuring the program.
Tonight at 7 in Kresge Auditorium, there will be a
forum devoted to discussion of the Western Culture
Program. Various viewpoints will be presented by fac
ulty members and students regarding the history, cur
rent status and future of the program, and there will be
an open question period. It is a valuable opportunity
for all members of the Stanford community to partici
pate in a discussion on this vital program. Indeed, it is
the responsibility of all students, faculty members and

administrators to help determine the future of a pro
gram considered the cornerstone of our education.
This forum should be seen in conjunction with the
other forums held recently at Stanford. All of these, in
cluding the forums on racism, divestment and the
decision-making process at Stanford, have been de
signed to improve the quality of life and education at
Stanford. Moreover, they have been student-initiated,
demonstrating the commitment of students to taking
an active role in defining the academic, social and work
environment at Stanford.
But in order for Stanford to change significantly, the
administration must be willing to listen to the com
ments and criticisms of students, faculty, staff and |
workers, and make an equal commitment to improving
life at Stanford. The issues raised at these forums have
seemed to drop out of sight all too quickly. In large
part, it seems that this is the result of the administra
tion's resistance to implementing substantive changes.
We hope that this will not be the case with the West
ern Culture forum. It is significant that various sectors
of the Stanford community will discuss the future of
the program, but we should not be satisfied with mere
discussion. The forum itself is not the end goal. It is
only the beginning of a longer process which must in
clude a critique and evaluation of the present program
and substantive proposals for improving this valuable
part of the educational experience at Stanford.
