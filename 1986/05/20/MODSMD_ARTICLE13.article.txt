Attend Western
Culture discussion
On Tuesday evening, May 21, a
forum on Western Culture will ad
dress issues of general interest to un
dergraduates and faculty, and I en
courage all to attend.
The Western Culture Program was
developed nearly a decade ago to
"equip men and women to deal more
effectively with problems they and
their societies encounter." In the
words of its founders, "A knowledge
of some of the past events and in
herited ideas, values and institutions
that have helped shape our society
helps us understand ourselves. Such
knowledge makes it possible for stu
dents to appreciate Western Culture
as well as criticize it effectively. It also
trains them to be better-informed
students of other cultures by giving
them a more sophisticated point of
reference.
"Western Culture is not the sole
property of some single contempo
rary ethnic group. It is a rich and
complex intellectual experience that
is part of the heritage of all our stu
dents in addition to any other that
they may enjoy. An education that
fails to provide some fairly systematic
study of this heritage is not serving
students well."
From 1977 to 1980, in a period of
intensive curricular reflection and
debate, a diversity of approaches
were proposed for serving the objec
tives of historical knowledge and cul
tural understanding. One approach
was, of course, the study of European
great works that became the current
program. But other proposals envi
sioned other approaches:
• an integrated study of art,
literature, and thought that would
devote the entire third quarter to

modern American and modern
Europe;
• a year-long study of the West and
the non-West that would juxtapose
distinctive features of various cultures
with "special references to different
geographical areas in which Stanford
has teaching strength: Africa, Latin
America and East Asia";
• a sequence in modern thought that
would include "the kinds of contribu
tions made by Eastern and Third
World Cultures: the influence of
African and Japanese painting, for in
stance, or of non-European myths on
contemporary thought. The last novel
to be read could usefully introduce
students to the great recent flowering
of serious fiction in Latin America";
• a Feminist Studies track that would
feature women writers and women's
contributions to European culture.
The Western Culture Program that
emerged from that period of reflec
tion and debate, the program with
which we are all familiar, brings many
advantages to Stanford undergradu
ate education. As a common aca
demic experience it creates important
intellectual bonds in the freshman
class. It teaches undergraduates early
on how to read critically, to write
coherently and to discuss cogently. It
brings into the freshman classroom
some of the University's most distin
guished and exciting humanists. It
challenges students to acquire a
knowledge of the culture of the West
and of many forces that have shaped
the modern world.
But is that enough? Does the study
of European great works serve well
the goals of self-knowledge, cultural
appreciation, intercultural under
standing and effective problem
solving? Might some other type of
shared freshman culture course, per
haps along the lines of the alterna
tives proposed before 1980 or some

other way of combining West and
non-West, majority and minority, be
more appropriate to a student body
that is itself multi-cultural and truer
to contemporary scholarship on the
world's cultures? Or does the current
arrangement, by which students sup
plement their year in Western Cul
ture with at least one quarter studying
a non-Western Culture, in fact appro
priately provide the cultural and
cross-cultural familiarities that our
students need?
These questions have recently been
raised by a number of faculty and stu
dents, and they invite thoughtful
replies. The Faculty Senate has asked
for a report on the Western Culture
Program, and the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies has committed
itself to undertake a thorough ex
amination of the issues. So now is the
time for all of us to exchange our
views with one another and move to
gether toward a better understanding
of what we are doing or might do.
The forum tonight will feature a
panel of students and faculty present
ing a broad spectrum of views on
Western Culture. Ample opportuni
ties for audience participation will
also be provided. I look forward to
seeing you tonight at 7 in Kresge Au
ditorium.
