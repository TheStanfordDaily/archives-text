# Cal Tech: road not taken
## 
### 
I was reading The Daily the other day, and I noticed the
article which compared the salaries of professors from an
assortment of universities. Stanford, of course, was one of
the five universities whose professors were paid the high
est. My experience with registration fees blunted the
shock of the figures. What caught my attention, however,
was the inclusion of Cal Tech as a comparably paying in
stitution. Memories of my past experiences with Cal Tech
immediately rushed to mind.
In one little-known segment of my life, light years away,
I entertained thoughts of entering the California Institute
of Technology. My family lived approximately three miles
from the tiny campus, and my parents frequently visited
the facilities for professional reasons. In fact, I had grown
up knowing what Cal Tech was even before knowing what

high school was. I participated in Cal Tech programs for
children #jpd questioned why all the people on
campus were unale. had long hair and beards, and looked
like they needed baths more than most aborigines. I asked
my mother if they were all hippies, and she said yes, but
they were intelligent hippies.
When it came time to apply to college, I was suddenly
confronted with the important decision of which colleges I
should solicit for applications. I was familiar with the big
names: Harvard, Yale, UCLA . . . then, of course, there
was Cal Tech. I had never seriously considered Stanford;
in fact, I hadn't really heard of it until my junior year in
high school. I applied to those colleges I thought were ap
propriate to my capabilities, and then I applied to Cal
Tech. I never thought I would be accepted. Cal Tech was
the ultimate source of scientific authority, outstanding
theorists, trendsetting thinkers — in a word, geniuses.
How could I possibly fit in?
To say the least, I was excited and pleased upon learn
ing that I had been accepted there. They actually believed
that I was cerebrally competent enough to join their ex
clusive intellectuality. I was honored.
I was all set to go to Cal Tech when the other accep
tances arrived in the mail. All of a sudden, I was faced
with decisions I previously had no real intentions of
making. Conflicting portions of my mind battled it out:
did I want to go to Harvard? Stanford? But wait, how
about Cal Tech?
The only solution I could conjure up was to visit the
universities which I was seriously considering. My over
night stay at Cal Tech was interesting (for lack of a better
word). I was impressed with the five-to-one male-female

ratio; however, I hadn't stopped to think what the males
were truly like. Besides, they were no longer hippies; they
were "individuals." I stomached the cold spaghetti and
passed it off as typical university food service. I walked
around the tiny campus and convinced myself that it was
very quaint; geniuses don't need that much space,
anyway. I was overwhelmed with the intelligence which
surrounded me. I was even more impressed with a third
floor room of one of the residence halls; it was equipped
with ultraviolet light which apparently enhanced the
growth of certain illegal substances.
I was not impressed, however, with the university's
humanities program. If I remember correctly, there was
one department whose formal title was simply
"Humanities." I was even less enchanted with the stu
dents' conception of a party. The night I stayed, the girls
were eagerly anticipating the party which was typically
scheduled for Thursday nights. I too became excited and
silently wondered to myself if I should ever tell my parents
about the evening.
As it turned out, the party to which they excitedly
referred was merely a gathering of abnormally entriusias
tic students who had a calculus problem set due the fol
lowing morning. I went to sleep that night, questioning my
initial intentions of joining this absurd little community of
smelly, unkempt and boring intellectuals.
The dean of admissions later called me and asked why I
hadn't formally accepted Cal Tech's offer of admission. I
explained my disenchantment, and to my surprise, he
agreed and recommended Stanford as the university at
which I would feel most comfortable. At the time, I ques
tioned his sanity. Now, however, as I reflect on those
frenzied weeks of important decision-making, I can't help
believing that the dean was justified in making the recom
mendation.
Stanford offered me not only the opportunity to sample
a variety of academic fields, it provided the necessary en
vironment to explore the entirely foreign area of social
dynamics. It is almost assured that if I had attended a dif
ferent university, I would not be as I am. The whole con
cept of the environment shaping the individual is credible,
at least for me. I suppose it is not up to me to judge how
worthy any environment or any individual might be. It is
my prerogative, however, to define my own self-worth. I
shudder to imagine the drastically different individual I
may have become had I gone to Cal Tech. I'm fairly cer
tain I would have been a chemical engineer who would
never have cared for the activities which interest me now.
It is perhaps timely to note that as I approach the real
world, I will again encounter decisions which will change
my attitudes and priorities. Perhaps these decisions will
not pertain to how much I appreciate calculus problem
sets, but they will be important decisions nonetheless.
One never knows; 10 years hence, I might look back and
sadly comment, "I should have gone to Cal Tech."

assortment of universities. Stanford, of course, was one of
the five universities whose professors were paid the high
est. My experience with registration fees blunted the
shock of the figures. What caught my attention, however,
was the inclusion of Cal Tech as a comparably paying in
stitution. Memories of my past experiences with Cal Tech
immediately rushed to mind.
In one little-known segment of my life, light years away,
I entertained thoughts of entering the California Institute
of Technology. My family lived approximately three miles
from the tiny campus, and my parents frequently visited
the facilities for professional reasons. In fact, I had grown
up knowing what Cal Tech was even before knowing what

high school was. I participated in Cal Tech programs for
children #jpd questioned why all the people on
campus were unale. had long hair and beards, and looked
like they needed baths more than most aborigines. I asked
my mother if they were all hippies, and she said yes, but
they were intelligent hippies.
When it came time to apply to college, I was suddenly
confronted with the important decision of which colleges I
should solicit for applications. I was familiar with the big
names: Harvard, Yale, UCLA . . . then, of course, there
was Cal Tech. I had never seriously considered Stanford;
in fact, I hadn't really heard of it until my junior year in
high school. I applied to those colleges I thought were ap
propriate to my capabilities, and then I applied to Cal
Tech. I never thought I would be accepted. Cal Tech was
the ultimate source of scientific authority, outstanding
theorists, trendsetting thinkers — in a word, geniuses.
How could I possibly fit in?
To say the least, I was excited and pleased upon learn
ing that I had been accepted there. They actually believed
that I was cerebrally competent enough to join their ex
clusive intellectuality. I was honored.
I was all set to go to Cal Tech when the other accep
tances arrived in the mail. All of a sudden, I was faced
with decisions I previously had no real intentions of
making. Conflicting portions of my mind battled it out:
did I want to go to Harvard? Stanford? But wait, how
about Cal Tech?
The only solution I could conjure up was to visit the
universities which I was seriously considering. My over
night stay at Cal Tech was interesting (for lack of a better
word). I was impressed with the five-to-one male-female

ratio; however, I hadn't stopped to think what the males
were truly like. Besides, they were no longer hippies; they
were "individuals." I stomached the cold spaghetti and
passed it off as typical university food service. I walked
around the tiny campus and convinced myself that it was
very quaint; geniuses don't need that much space,
anyway. I was overwhelmed with the intelligence which
surrounded me. I was even more impressed with a third
floor room of one of the residence halls; it was equipped
with ultraviolet light which apparently enhanced the
growth of certain illegal substances.
I was not impressed, however, with the university's
humanities program. If I remember correctly, there was
one department whose formal title was simply
"Humanities." I was even less enchanted with the stu
dents' conception of a party. The night I stayed, the girls
were eagerly anticipating the party which was typically
scheduled for Thursday nights. I too became excited and
silently wondered to myself if I should ever tell my parents
about the evening.
As it turned out, the party to which they excitedly
referred was merely a gathering of abnormally entriusias
tic students who had a calculus problem set due the fol
lowing morning. I went to sleep that night, questioning my
initial intentions of joining this absurd little community of
smelly, unkempt and boring intellectuals.
The dean of admissions later called me and asked why I
hadn't formally accepted Cal Tech's offer of admission. I
explained my disenchantment, and to my surprise, he
agreed and recommended Stanford as the university at
which I would feel most comfortable. At the time, I ques
tioned his sanity. Now, however, as I reflect on those
frenzied weeks of important decision-making, I can't help
believing that the dean was justified in making the recom
mendation.
Stanford offered me not only the opportunity to sample
a variety of academic fields, it provided the necessary en
vironment to explore the entirely foreign area of social
dynamics. It is almost assured that if I had attended a dif
ferent university, I would not be as I am. The whole con
cept of the environment shaping the individual is credible,
at least for me. I suppose it is not up to me to judge how
worthy any environment or any individual might be. It is
my prerogative, however, to define my own self-worth. I
shudder to imagine the drastically different individual I
may have become had I gone to Cal Tech. I'm fairly cer
tain I would have been a chemical engineer who would
never have cared for the activities which interest me now.
It is perhaps timely to note that as I approach the real
world, I will again encounter decisions which will change
my attitudes and priorities. Perhaps these decisions will
not pertain to how much I appreciate calculus problem
sets, but they will be important decisions nonetheless.
One never knows; 10 years hence, I might look back and
sadly comment, "I should have gone to Cal Tech."
