## 'Direct action' needed for change 
### 
In Round Two of his attack on campus anti
apartheid protests, "Protests alienate students"
(Daily, May 12), Jason Matherly expands on his
"law-and-order-above-all" attitude and his dis
paragement of direct action tactics by the student
anti-apartheid movement. The enthusiasm of the
400-person-plus crowd at the rally on May 12
proves that Matherly fails to speak for "students at
Stanford" as he presumes. Nonetheless, it is impor
tant to point out the major fallacies presented in his
past two columns.
In his first column, "Dealing with illegal protest"
(Daily, April 29), Matherly called for harsher

measures on the part of university administrations
to repress what he deems "illegal" protests. In light
of the example he uses, the April 3 incident at UC-
Berkeley, this demand is truly frightening. Let's
take a moment to compare his account with the
facts, as reported by eyewitnesses in local
newspapers.
At 3 p.m. police arrived to forcibly remove a
peaceful shantytown outside California Hall. Stu
dents refused to move and constructed barricades,
using garbage cans and even their own bodies to
halt police paddy wagons. Police officers (whose
ranks swelled to over 200 from campus and sur
rounding areas) responded to the non-violent
blockades with indiscriminate beatings. After
several hours, a rock was thrown into police lines.
An eyewitness describes the ensuing melee: "The
police surged forward and lit into the crowd, club
bing the living shit out of people. It was horrible.

There were broken kneecaps, broken arms, people
hurled around, bloody heads and faces . . . ("What
went down," San Francisco Chronicle, April 7).
In the end, 91 students were arrested and their
bail was set at $7,250 — one of the highest ever for
such an instance. No police officers wer£ dis
ciplined although their behavior was condemned by
the mayor and city and council. If this response is
"apologetic, accommodating and groveling," as
Matherly believes, I shudder to picture what he
would consider appropriate. Must we suffer an
other Kent State before we condemn this "legal"
violence used against student protest?
Second, Matherly's emphasis on legality and
proper channels ignores the arbitrary definition of
these terms on college campuses. It is ironic to note
that what is "illegal" one day is legal the next. The
Berkeley students reconstructed their shanties and
they are now considered "educational vehicles,"
offering informational fliers at points across
campus with official sanction. Undoubtedly, Math
erly will be disappointed to hear this; true, shanties
are eyesores, but that's exactly the point. No one
should have to live that way.
The final fallacy of Matherly's criticism on direct
action tactics is his lack of historical perspective. I
was active in the divestment campaign at Stanford
in 1976-79, and was one of the 300 people who
chose civil disobedience as a way to show not only
our abhorrence of apartheid and Stanford's ties
with South Africa, but also our frustration at the
disdain of the University administration for student
input. For over 10 years now, we have been denied
hearings at trustee's meetings, submitted commit
tee recommendations only to be rebuffed, proven
student mandates, garnered signatures — all to no

avail. Our careful documentation of U.S. corpora
tions' role in propping up the South Africa regime
(which resulted in a nationally-published book)
meant nothing in the face of their cost-benefit
analyses. We have asked for "constructive debate"
and more often than not met with closed doors.
Meanwhile, thousands upon thousands of names
have been added to the list of apartheid's victims —
babies who have died of malnutrition, children who
were shot in the streets, activists who disappeared
from prison cells. . . .
To say that the ASSU vote to divest and the pre
sentation of the Committee on Investment Respon
sibility have nothing to do with the rallies is clearly
ridiculous. These small gains, as well as the admin
istration's decision to divest of Newmont Mining
stock, are a direct result of student protest. Com
mitted activists have worked for years in many
ways; they serve on the C-IR, organize ASSU sup
port and yell slogans at rallies. It is this multi
faceted approach which has won divestment at a
growing number of universities across the country.
These tactics are a right and responsibility of all
citizens and have brought about the most signifi
cant civil and human rights gains in our history.
Student anti-apartheid protesters will continue
non-violent, even "illegal," protests as long as the
apartheid system defames this earth. It's not be
cause we like to have our heads beat in, or to spend
time and money on jail sentences. Such sacrifices
are born of frustration with "proper channels" that
block democracy at this University.
Remember, in South Africa apartheid is the law
of the land.
