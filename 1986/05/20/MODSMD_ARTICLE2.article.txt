# Officials explain fraternity drug rule
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
University officials yesterday said
that members of the Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity have been asked to follow
an honor code for drug use.
Under the new rule, members of
the fraternity must not only refrain
from drug use but also turn in any
other house members whom they see
using drugs.
The University's rule represents a
last-ditch effort to help the troubled
fraternity retain its housing
privileges, according to the officials.
"It was that or lose the house," said
Diana Conklin, assistant dean ol Stu
dent Affairs and director of the Row.
Conklin, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano offered their
views yesterday in an hour-long lunch
meeting at The Daily.
The Alpha Delt fraternity has
drawn fire for reported drug use,
abuse and sales at the house, and also
for academic and financial problems
and repeated failure to meet a Uni
versity quota for residents.
The fraternity has not yet submit
ted its signed oath to the administra
tion, but is expected to do so soon.
Conklin said the fraternity must
promise that its pledges as well as its
current residents will abide by the
new rules, and she said she is confi
dent the Alpha Delts will live up to
the honor code.
"It's my assumption that if people
sign an oath, they will keep it," Con
klin said, adding that "if the house is
full of oath-breakers, it will be an
empty house."
Lyons, who asserted that the Uni
versity has been "a little too patient"
with fraternities recently, said the
honor code stipulation is an honest
administrative gesture to give the fra
ternity another chance.
But if they don't abide by the state
ments they sign, the fraternity mem
bers face stiff penalties, Lyons said.
"If those statements don't work,
then new issues arise," he said. "It
becomes a matter of honor and trust,
and the ante goes up."
Conklin said the University will not
use sophisticated methods, such as
drug testing, to verify Alpha Delt
compliance with the treaty.
Verification is best achieved by
word of mouth, Conklin said, noting
that the University is a "small town
— you hear a lot."
Lyons then referred to Conklin as
"the mayor of the Row."
Lyons asserted that there have
been "more cases (this year) where
individuals have come in (for help) as
serious alcoholics than any time in my
memory . . . and also more cases of
serious cocaine addiction."
He said the University has no plans
to regulate drug use campus-wide,
noting. "It would be sheer folly."
