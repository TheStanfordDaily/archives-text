## You spell 'Gaddafi' and I spell 'Qadhafi'... 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
He looked to his left and saw the hourglass.
The sand was trickling away inexorably —
time was running out. . . only a few columns
left. He looked to his right and saw the huge
pile of unanswered questions. He looked
straight ahead and saw the blank screen of the
computer terminal.
Sweat began to stream from his wrinkled
brow and he wrung his hands uncontrollably.
Hand-wringing gave way to fingernail
chewing, and then to teeth-gnashing. A
frenzied look came into his eyes as he reached
a trembling hand toward the Maalox bottle.
The nightmare had begun.
Dear Bug Me,
When I read the newspaper and magazine
stories about Libya and the United States, I
don't retain any of the facts that are stated.
This is because I am bugged by the many ways
I have seen the name of Moammar Khadafy
spelled.
"Khadafy" is how it was spelled by The
Daily, the San Francisco Chronicle and other
newspapers. "Gaddafi" is how it was spelled
in Time magazine. "Kaddafi" is how it was
spelled in Newsweek magazine.
"Kadafi" is how it was spelled in the Los
Angeles Times. "Qadhafi" is how the Wall
Street Journal and U.S. News and World
Report spell it. "Khadafi" is how The Daily
spelled it on April 10, 1986
What is the correct way to spell his name?
- Al Villanueva
This gentleman knows how to get the atten
tion of the Bug Me writer. Not only was this
inquiry extensively researched, typed and
signed, but it also used a form of the verb "to
bug." I just had to answer this one.
Poor Moammar: We bomb him, our presi
dent calls him names and nobody spells his
real name right. Is it any wonder the guy was
suffering from depression?
Apparently, however, there really is no
right way to spell Khadafy's name using the
English alphabet. According to reference li
brarian David Langenberg of Green Library,

Qadhafi in English is a transliteration from
Arabic. There's no way to exactly replicate
the sounds of Arabic speech with the English
alphabet, and there are several common
schemes of transliteration, so each paper es
tablishes its own style of spelling.
Langenberg said that the particular prob
lem with Kaddafi's name is the "guttural 'k'
sound" at the beginning of the name.
"There's no correspondence to that sound
in English," he said.
My personal opinion is that we ought to
forget about Gaddafi's real name and just
refer to him as ... uh ... oh gee, I don't know
.. . maybe "Mad Dog," or something really
mean but catchy like that. Yeah, it might hurt
his feelings and maybe intimidate him a little,
but it seems so appropriate.
Dear Bug Me,
We run the Dish in the mornings at 6:30 and
frequently meet cars and sometimes a
motorbike on the road up there in the hills.
Who has access to that road and what are they
doing up there at that time in the morning?
- Jogging Mom
There are two electronically-operated gates
that provide access to this road, according to
Bruce Wiggins, assistant director of Univer
sity Operations and Maintenance. Qualified
persons are issued plastic cards that open the
gates when necessary.
Wiggins said that there are two big groups
that qualify for the cards: researchers and
members of the University's grounds and land
management departments. The researchers
are there to take advantage of the many radio
facilities in the area of the Dish.
Researchers must demonstrate an academic
or business need to gain access to the road.
Cow-tipping doesn't qualify.
The Stanford Research Institute alone has
been issued over 300 cards, Wiggins said, es
timating that the total number of cards cur
rently circulating is around 400.
That should answer the first part of the
question. As for the question about why these
people are doing their research or whatever at
that hour of the morning, that's about as inex
plicable to me as why anybody would want to

be jogging at that hour. So you'll have to ask
them yourself.
Dear Bug Me,
Two questions regarding the new (I'm old,
so the tower is new) clock tower opposite Engi
neering I Language corner:
What is the significance of the small metal
rod that is opposite the minute hand on each of
the faces? It moves with the minute hand - is it
used for balance?
What is the 'mistake' on the faces of the
tower? And is it truly a mistake? I've seen this
"mistake" on many other towers and clock
faces -1 just saw one in a store window on Un
ion Square.
-Jiffy-Pop Popcorn

Appropriately enough, this question took a
long time to answer, and the questioner had to
browbeat me repeatedly and generally be
very obnoxious before I finally tracked down
the answer.
Gene Kershner, the associate director of
University Project Management, helped me
get started, and in the end I got the actual in
formation from John Grass, a Redwood City
clockworker who worked on the new clock
tower when it was built about four years ago.
Grass confirmed the guess that the metal
rod running opposite the minute hand is for
balance. The hands of the clock are made of
redwood, but they're large enough to require
"some reasonable amount of force" to move,
especially going up between VII and X. The
rod, made of stainless steel, provides the ne
cessary counterbalance.
Grass explained that the rod also balances
against things that might weigh the hands
down, like pigeons sitting on the hands and, in
the East and other colder climes, against snow
accumulating on the hands.
The second question refers, I think, to the
fact that in the Roman numeral progression
on the clockface, the number four is

represented by "I III" instead of "IV."
According to Grass, this is standard on
most clocks — he said that only one out of
about a thousand clocks has IV for four.
The reason he cited is simple enough, and
it's purely aesthetic: "1111" balances the
" VIII" (he referred to it as "the heavy eight")
that is across from it on the clock, and thus
provides visual symmetry.
Dear Bug Me,
How do radio stations get their ratings? Is
this how they decide how much to charge their
advertisers?
- Andy Corr
The real question is "Why didn't this ques
tion appear in my mailbox until April 15
when it was postmarked October 23, 1985?"
I'm not joking.
But I think the post office gets enough
abuse already, so I'm not going to pursue this.
In regard to the real question, I spoke first
to Mary Beth MacDade of KFOG's sales de
partment and then to a client service repre
sentative at the Arbitron company.
Most radio stations — including KFOG —
get ratings by subscribing to an independent
research company's rating service. Arbitron is
one of those companies, and here's how they
arrive at their ratings:
The country is divided into "markets," one
example of which would be San Francisco.
Arbitron passes out diaries to a random selec
tion of persons living in a given market. Sur
vey periods are 12 weeks long, and a person
fills out a diary for only one out of those 12
weeks, writing down the times and stations
they listened to during the week. A "survey
week," then, is an average of 12 weeks. The
survey week results are then sent to any sta
tions which subscribe to the service.
MacDade said that the ratings are "partly
what goes into" determining advertising rates.
Dear Bug Me,
Has anyone ever been locked overnight in
Meyer Library? If so, what happened to them?
Were they eaten by bats? This leads to my next
question. Is the Meyer Library staff aware that
their building is bat-infested? And if so, why

aren 't they doing anything about it?
- Scared of the dark
This seems to be a big day for multi-part
questions.
Maybe these two questions are related.
Maybe people who stay in the library too long
at night magically turn into bats and are then
cursed to fly about forever, which might
throw a considerable wrench into those indi
viduals' plans to graduate and do some other
stuff with their lives.
Then again, maybe people who stay in the
library at night just fall asleep and wake up to
find that they've slobbered on their
notebooks and their friends have deserted
them to go get some fro yo at the Co Po (ooh,
check that lingo).
On the other hand, maybe I'm rambling
along on a meaningless tangent because I'm
tired of answering serious questions.
I spoke with acting head librarian Bob Kieft
of Meyer Library. According to him, it would
be impossible for anyone to be inadvertently
locked in the library overnight,because all the
exit doors of Meyer have "panic bars" — that
is to say, they can always be opened from the
inside. Green, on the other hand, doesn't
have such doors.
It seems that if a person really wanted to
spend the night in Meyer, they could.
However, they'd have to hide from the
monitors who check the library for stragglers
and nappers after closing. Persons who are
found still in the library are merely asked to
leave, according to Kieft. Personally, I can't
imagine why they would want to stay: ifs too
dark to study and I could think of a lot of
other places with more ambiance than Meyer
Library after closing. The Knoll, for instance,
or the Band Shak.
Speaking of ambiance, I think the bats give
Meyer some much-needed ambiance. Yes,
the staff does know about the bats: in fact,
they already have done a lot about the bat
population, according to Kieft. There have
been several recent efforts to rid the building
of the pesky critters, and according to both
Kieft and Roy Stampfli of University Opera
tions and Maintenance, the number of bats
has gone "way down."

Apparently, however, there really is no
right way to spell Khadafy's name using the
English alphabet. According to reference li
brarian David Langenberg of Green Library,

Qadhafi in English is a transliteration from
Arabic. There's no way to exactly replicate
the sounds of Arabic speech with the English
alphabet, and there are several common
schemes of transliteration, so each paper es
tablishes its own style of spelling.
Langenberg said that the particular prob
lem with Kaddafi's name is the "guttural 'k'
sound" at the beginning of the name.
"There's no correspondence to that sound
in English," he said.
My personal opinion is that we ought to
forget about Gaddafi's real name and just
refer to him as ... uh ... oh gee, I don't know
.. . maybe "Mad Dog," or something really
mean but catchy like that. Yeah, it might hurt
his feelings and maybe intimidate him a little,
but it seems so appropriate.
Dear Bug Me,
We run the Dish in the mornings at 6:30 and
frequently meet cars and sometimes a
motorbike on the road up there in the hills.
Who has access to that road and what are they
doing up there at that time in the morning?
- Jogging Mom
There are two electronically-operated gates
that provide access to this road, according to
Bruce Wiggins, assistant director of Univer
sity Operations and Maintenance. Qualified
persons are issued plastic cards that open the
gates when necessary.
Wiggins said that there are two big groups
that qualify for the cards: researchers and
members of the University's grounds and land
management departments. The researchers
are there to take advantage of the many radio
facilities in the area of the Dish.
Researchers must demonstrate an academic
or business need to gain access to the road.
Cow-tipping doesn't qualify.
The Stanford Research Institute alone has
been issued over 300 cards, Wiggins said, es
timating that the total number of cards cur
rently circulating is around 400.
That should answer the first part of the
question. As for the question about why these
people are doing their research or whatever at
that hour of the morning, that's about as inex
plicable to me as why anybody would want to

be jogging at that hour. So you'll have to ask
them yourself.
Dear Bug Me,
Two questions regarding the new (I'm old,
so the tower is new) clock tower opposite Engi
neering I Language corner:
What is the significance of the small metal
rod that is opposite the minute hand on each of
the faces? It moves with the minute hand - is it
used for balance?
What is the 'mistake' on the faces of the
tower? And is it truly a mistake? I've seen this
"mistake" on many other towers and clock
faces -1 just saw one in a store window on Un
ion Square.
-Jiffy-Pop Popcorn

Appropriately enough, this question took a
long time to answer, and the questioner had to
browbeat me repeatedly and generally be
very obnoxious before I finally tracked down
the answer.
Gene Kershner, the associate director of
University Project Management, helped me
get started, and in the end I got the actual in
formation from John Grass, a Redwood City
clockworker who worked on the new clock
tower when it was built about four years ago.
Grass confirmed the guess that the metal
rod running opposite the minute hand is for
balance. The hands of the clock are made of
redwood, but they're large enough to require
"some reasonable amount of force" to move,
especially going up between VII and X. The
rod, made of stainless steel, provides the ne
cessary counterbalance.
Grass explained that the rod also balances
against things that might weigh the hands
down, like pigeons sitting on the hands and, in
the East and other colder climes, against snow
accumulating on the hands.
The second question refers, I think, to the
fact that in the Roman numeral progression
on the clockface, the number four is

represented by "I III" instead of "IV."
According to Grass, this is standard on
most clocks — he said that only one out of
about a thousand clocks has IV for four.
The reason he cited is simple enough, and
it's purely aesthetic: "1111" balances the
" VIII" (he referred to it as "the heavy eight")
that is across from it on the clock, and thus
provides visual symmetry.
Dear Bug Me,
How do radio stations get their ratings? Is
this how they decide how much to charge their
advertisers?
- Andy Corr
The real question is "Why didn't this ques
tion appear in my mailbox until April 15
when it was postmarked October 23, 1985?"
I'm not joking.
But I think the post office gets enough
abuse already, so I'm not going to pursue this.
In regard to the real question, I spoke first
to Mary Beth MacDade of KFOG's sales de
partment and then to a client service repre
sentative at the Arbitron company.
Most radio stations — including KFOG —
get ratings by subscribing to an independent
research company's rating service. Arbitron is
one of those companies, and here's how they
arrive at their ratings:
The country is divided into "markets," one
example of which would be San Francisco.
Arbitron passes out diaries to a random selec
tion of persons living in a given market. Sur
vey periods are 12 weeks long, and a person
fills out a diary for only one out of those 12
weeks, writing down the times and stations
they listened to during the week. A "survey
week," then, is an average of 12 weeks. The
survey week results are then sent to any sta
tions which subscribe to the service.
MacDade said that the ratings are "partly
what goes into" determining advertising rates.
Dear Bug Me,
Has anyone ever been locked overnight in
Meyer Library? If so, what happened to them?
Were they eaten by bats? This leads to my next
question. Is the Meyer Library staff aware that
their building is bat-infested? And if so, why

aren 't they doing anything about it?
- Scared of the dark
This seems to be a big day for multi-part
questions.
Maybe these two questions are related.
Maybe people who stay in the library too long
at night magically turn into bats and are then
cursed to fly about forever, which might
throw a considerable wrench into those indi
viduals' plans to graduate and do some other
stuff with their lives.
Then again, maybe people who stay in the
library at night just fall asleep and wake up to
find that they've slobbered on their
notebooks and their friends have deserted
them to go get some fro yo at the Co Po (ooh,
check that lingo).
On the other hand, maybe I'm rambling
along on a meaningless tangent because I'm
tired of answering serious questions.
I spoke with acting head librarian Bob Kieft
of Meyer Library. According to him, it would
be impossible for anyone to be inadvertently
locked in the library overnight,because all the
exit doors of Meyer have "panic bars" — that
is to say, they can always be opened from the
inside. Green, on the other hand, doesn't
have such doors.
It seems that if a person really wanted to
spend the night in Meyer, they could.
However, they'd have to hide from the
monitors who check the library for stragglers
and nappers after closing. Persons who are
found still in the library are merely asked to
leave, according to Kieft. Personally, I can't
imagine why they would want to stay: ifs too
dark to study and I could think of a lot of
other places with more ambiance than Meyer
Library after closing. The Knoll, for instance,
or the Band Shak.
Speaking of ambiance, I think the bats give
Meyer some much-needed ambiance. Yes,
the staff does know about the bats: in fact,
they already have done a lot about the bat
population, according to Kieft. There have
been several recent efforts to rid the building
of the pesky critters, and according to both
Kieft and Roy Stampfli of University Opera
tions and Maintenance, the number of bats
has gone "way down."


BUG ME
He looked to his left and saw the hourglass.
The sand was trickling away inexorably —
time was running out. . . only a few columns
left. He looked to his right and saw the huge
pile of unanswered questions. He looked
straight ahead and saw the blank screen of the
computer terminal.
Sweat began to stream from his wrinkled
brow and he wrung his hands uncontrollably.
Hand-wringing gave way to fingernail
chewing, and then to teeth-gnashing. A
frenzied look came into his eyes as he reached
a trembling hand toward the Maalox bottle.
The nightmare had begun.
Dear Bug Me,
When I read the newspaper and magazine
stories about Libya and the United States, I
don't retain any of the facts that are stated.
This is because I am bugged by the many ways
I have seen the name of Moammar Khadafy
spelled.
"Khadafy" is how it was spelled by The
Daily, the San Francisco Chronicle and other
newspapers. "Gaddafi" is how it was spelled
in Time magazine. "Kaddafi" is how it was
spelled in Newsweek magazine.
"Kadafi" is how it was spelled in the Los
Angeles Times. "Qadhafi" is how the Wall
Street Journal and U.S. News and World
Report spell it. "Khadafi" is how The Daily
spelled it on April 10, 1986
What is the correct way to spell his name?
- Al Villanueva
This gentleman knows how to get the atten
tion of the Bug Me writer. Not only was this
inquiry extensively researched, typed and
signed, but it also used a form of the verb "to
bug." I just had to answer this one.
Poor Moammar: We bomb him, our presi
dent calls him names and nobody spells his
real name right. Is it any wonder the guy was
suffering from depression?

been issued over 300 cards, Wiggins said, es
timating that the total number of cards cur
rently circulating is around 400.
That should answer the first part of the
question. As for the question about why these
people are doing their research or whatever at
that hour of the morning, that's about as inex
plicable to me as why anybody would want to

be jogging at that hour. So you'll have to ask
them yourself.
Dear Bug Me,
Two questions regarding the new (I'm old,
so the tower is new) clock tower opposite Engi
neering I Language corner:
What is the significance of the small metal
rod that is opposite the minute hand on each of
the faces? It moves with the minute hand - is it
used for balance?
What is the 'mistake' on the faces of the
tower? And is it truly a mistake? I've seen this
"mistake" on many other towers and clock
faces -1 just saw one in a store window on Un
ion Square.
-Jiffy-Pop Popcorn

Appropriately enough, this question took a
long time to answer, and the questioner had to
browbeat me repeatedly and generally be
very obnoxious before I finally tracked down
the answer.
Gene Kershner, the associate director of
University Project Management, helped me
get started, and in the end I got the actual in
formation from John Grass, a Redwood City
clockworker who worked on the new clock
tower when it was built about four years ago.
Grass confirmed the guess that the metal
rod running opposite the minute hand is for
balance. The hands of the clock are made of
redwood, but they're large enough to require
"some reasonable amount of force" to move,
especially going up between VII and X. The
rod, made of stainless steel, provides the ne
cessary counterbalance.
Grass explained that the rod also balances
against things that might weigh the hands
down, like pigeons sitting on the hands and, in
the East and other colder climes, against snow
accumulating on the hands.
The second question refers, I think, to the
fact that in the Roman numeral progression
on the clockface, the number four is

represented by "I III" instead of "IV."
According to Grass, this is standard on
most clocks — he said that only one out of
about a thousand clocks has IV for four.
The reason he cited is simple enough, and
it's purely aesthetic: "1111" balances the
" VIII" (he referred to it as "the heavy eight")
that is across from it on the clock, and thus
provides visual symmetry.
Dear Bug Me,
How do radio stations get their ratings? Is
this how they decide how much to charge their
advertisers?
- Andy Corr
The real question is "Why didn't this ques
tion appear in my mailbox until April 15
when it was postmarked October 23, 1985?"
I'm not joking.
But I think the post office gets enough
abuse already, so I'm not going to pursue this.
In regard to the real question, I spoke first
to Mary Beth MacDade of KFOG's sales de
partment and then to a client service repre
sentative at the Arbitron company.
Most radio stations — including KFOG —
get ratings by subscribing to an independent
research company's rating service. Arbitron is
one of those companies, and here's how they
arrive at their ratings:
The country is divided into "markets," one
example of which would be San Francisco.
Arbitron passes out diaries to a random selec
tion of persons living in a given market. Sur
vey periods are 12 weeks long, and a person
fills out a diary for only one out of those 12
weeks, writing down the times and stations
they listened to during the week. A "survey
week," then, is an average of 12 weeks. The
survey week results are then sent to any sta
tions which subscribe to the service.
MacDade said that the ratings are "partly
what goes into" determining advertising rates.
Dear Bug Me,
Has anyone ever been locked overnight in
Meyer Library? If so, what happened to them?
Were they eaten by bats? This leads to my next
question. Is the Meyer Library staff aware that
their building is bat-infested? And if so, why

aren 't they doing anything about it?
- Scared of the dark
This seems to be a big day for multi-part
questions.
Maybe these two questions are related.
Maybe people who stay in the library too long
at night magically turn into bats and are then
cursed to fly about forever, which might
throw a considerable wrench into those indi
viduals' plans to graduate and do some other
stuff with their lives.
Then again, maybe people who stay in the
library at night just fall asleep and wake up to
find that they've slobbered on their
notebooks and their friends have deserted
them to go get some fro yo at the Co Po (ooh,
check that lingo).
On the other hand, maybe I'm rambling
along on a meaningless tangent because I'm
tired of answering serious questions.
I spoke with acting head librarian Bob Kieft
of Meyer Library. According to him, it would
be impossible for anyone to be inadvertently
locked in the library overnight,because all the
exit doors of Meyer have "panic bars" — that
is to say, they can always be opened from the
inside. Green, on the other hand, doesn't
have such doors.
It seems that if a person really wanted to
spend the night in Meyer, they could.
However, they'd have to hide from the
monitors who check the library for stragglers
and nappers after closing. Persons who are
found still in the library are merely asked to
leave, according to Kieft. Personally, I can't
imagine why they would want to stay: ifs too
dark to study and I could think of a lot of
other places with more ambiance than Meyer
Library after closing. The Knoll, for instance,
or the Band Shak.
Speaking of ambiance, I think the bats give
Meyer some much-needed ambiance. Yes,
the staff does know about the bats: in fact,
they already have done a lot about the bat
population, according to Kieft. There have
been several recent efforts to rid the building
of the pesky critters, and according to both
Kieft and Roy Stampfli of University Opera
tions and Maintenance, the number of bats
has gone "way down."


BUG ME
He looked to his left and saw the hourglass.
The sand was trickling away inexorably —
time was running out. . . only a few columns
left. He looked to his right and saw the huge
pile of unanswered questions. He looked
straight ahead and saw the blank screen of the
computer terminal.
Sweat began to stream from his wrinkled
brow and he wrung his hands uncontrollably.
Hand-wringing gave way to fingernail
chewing, and then to teeth-gnashing. A
frenzied look came into his eyes as he reached
a trembling hand toward the Maalox bottle.
The nightmare had begun.
Dear Bug Me,
When I read the newspaper and magazine
stories about Libya and the United States, I
don't retain any of the facts that are stated.
This is because I am bugged by the many ways
I have seen the name of Moammar Khadafy
spelled.
"Khadafy" is how it was spelled by The
Daily, the San Francisco Chronicle and other
newspapers. "Gaddafi" is how it was spelled
in Time magazine. "Kaddafi" is how it was
spelled in Newsweek magazine.
"Kadafi" is how it was spelled in the Los
Angeles Times. "Qadhafi" is how the Wall
Street Journal and U.S. News and World
Report spell it. "Khadafi" is how The Daily
spelled it on April 10, 1986
What is the correct way to spell his name?
- Al Villanueva
This gentleman knows how to get the atten
tion of the Bug Me writer. Not only was this
inquiry extensively researched, typed and
signed, but it also used a form of the verb "to
bug." I just had to answer this one.
Poor Moammar: We bomb him, our presi
dent calls him names and nobody spells his
real name right. Is it any wonder the guy was
suffering from depression?
Apparently, however, there really is no
right way to spell Khadafy's name using the
English alphabet. According to reference li
brarian David Langenberg of Green Library,

Qadhafi in English is a transliteration from
Arabic. There's no way to exactly replicate
the sounds of Arabic speech with the English
alphabet, and there are several common
schemes of transliteration, so each paper es
tablishes its own style of spelling.
Langenberg said that the particular prob
lem with Kaddafi's name is the "guttural 'k'
sound" at the beginning of the name.
"There's no correspondence to that sound
in English," he said.
My personal opinion is that we ought to
forget about Gaddafi's real name and just
refer to him as ... uh ... oh gee, I don't know
.. . maybe "Mad Dog," or something really
mean but catchy like that. Yeah, it might hurt
his feelings and maybe intimidate him a little,
but it seems so appropriate.
Dear Bug Me,
We run the Dish in the mornings at 6:30 and
frequently meet cars and sometimes a
motorbike on the road up there in the hills.
Who has access to that road and what are they
doing up there at that time in the morning?
- Jogging Mom
There are two electronically-operated gates
that provide access to this road, according to
Bruce Wiggins, assistant director of Univer
sity Operations and Maintenance. Qualified
persons are issued plastic cards that open the
gates when necessary.
Wiggins said that there are two big groups
that qualify for the cards: researchers and
members of the University's grounds and land
management departments. The researchers
are there to take advantage of the many radio
facilities in the area of the Dish.
Researchers must demonstrate an academic
or business need to gain access to the road.
Cow-tipping doesn't qualify.
The Stanford Research Institute alone has
been issued over 300 cards, Wiggins said, es
timating that the total number of cards cur
rently circulating is around 400.
That should answer the first part of the
