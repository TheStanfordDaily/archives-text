# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

A bunch of ding-dongs
Freshmen at Stanford have it easy — all they have to
do to become sophomores is acquire 45 units. At Prince
ton, they have to steal the clapper from the Nassau Hall
bell tower.
Princeton frosh 'Ed' and 'Jedd' dodged a clanging bell
to earn their fellow classmates' rites of passage.
"Tradition was saved," Ed said. The two refused to
divulge their true identities, according to The Daily
Princetonian.
The clap per-nappe rs apparently disguised themselves
as construction workers and convinced a naive Nassau
Hall security officer to give them keys to the bell tower.
The security guard pleaded, "They looked like con
struction workers. They were scruffy and, oh, gee, I
don't believe this."
There was a brief moment of hysteria when, while still
unscrewing a bolt, one of the freshmen realized that the
bell was going to ring in 30 seconds. The two hurriedly
scampered down the tower's ladder and waited for the
bell to stop ringing before finishing their job.
They will "absolutely not" return the clapper to its
rightful owners, 'Jedd' told the Princetonian.
You sneaky little devils.

The Love Connection
Does your social life stink? Are you sitting at home
night after night with nothing to do but watch Baretta
reruns? If you had gone to the University of Michigan
instead of here you would dash over to your computer
terminal to alleviate the boredom.
A new computer privilege has allowed students to set
up a telecommunications conference. 'Confer-ing', as
they call it, enables students to discuss different topics or
'items' with others in the conference, via the computer.
One such item included is 'flirt'.
"You basically flirt with people you've never seen
(by) sending out leading messages," said Susie Jun, a
sophomore 'confer'. Once a month the confers are
allowed to meet the person on the other side of the com
puter "face-to-face," Jun said.
"The ratio of guys to girls (in the confer) is 8:1," said
Jun. "So whenever a girl gets on, she gets a lot of mail."
That's get on to the computer, folks.
Less than 60 percent of the confers are computer sci
ence or engineering majors. That is not imply that those
in these majors have worst social life, however correct it
may be. Instead, this statistic points out that
"teleconferencing and electronic mail are the only things

you can do on computers without knowing anything
about them," Jun explained.
One popular question among the confer-ers these
days is "When you're 'confer-ing,' do you prefer the act
or do you prefer cuddling?"
Jun thinks they prefer cuddling. "Doing the act re
quires too much concentration," she said. Yes, she said
this.
The Ann Arbor school instituted this program, which
'confers' see as "the wave of the future."
Maybe Baretta re-runs aren't so bad, after all.
Oops. . .
This one's so ingenious all by itself, it needs no edito
rial insertions. Here is most of the article as it was writ
ten in the Daily Texan:
Daily Texan editor Russell Scott was arrested Friday
night (May 2) during the Texas Student Publications'
year-end banquet and charged with carrying a hoax
bomb, a charge he called "absurd" after his release.
Scott, a journalism senior, was taken from the Texas
Tumbleweed restaurant at 9:17 p.m. by Travis County
sheriff s deputies, who had received a telephone com
plaint. Scott was charged with possession of a hoax

bomb, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one
year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
"Jt's so absurd," Scott spid. "If anyone had told me
they were concerned or frightened, I would have been
perfectly happy to take it off."
Scott was released from the Travis County Jail Friday
night on a $1,000 personal recognizance bond by Justice
of the Peace Richard Scott, who is not related to the
editor. Scott will have to appear in court May 21. .. .
Scott was attending the TSP banquet in the restau
rant's private ballroom. More than 40 Daily Texan staff
ers came dressed in military fatigues as part of a 'Year of
the Terrorist' theme.
Scott was dressed in a sheik's robe with an alarm clock
and seven road flares taped to the clothing on his chest.
Curtis Weeks, spokesman for the Travis County
Sheriff, said Scott was arrested "because there was a
complaint."
"With the present-day world situation, people are a
little tense about bomb hoaxes," Weeks said. "They (the
arresting officers) found out at the scene that these were
just road flares," but were within their rights to arrest
Scott.
But Scott said the officers "ludicrously and laughably
overreacted" by making the arrest.

bomb, a charge he called "absurd" after his release.
Scott, a journalism senior, was taken from the Texas
Tumbleweed restaurant at 9:17 p.m. by Travis County
sheriff s deputies, who had received a telephone com
plaint. Scott was charged with possession of a hoax

bomb, a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one
year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
"Jt's so absurd," Scott spid. "If anyone had told me
they were concerned or frightened, I would have been
perfectly happy to take it off."
Scott was released from the Travis County Jail Friday
night on a $1,000 personal recognizance bond by Justice
of the Peace Richard Scott, who is not related to the
editor. Scott will have to appear in court May 21. .. .
Scott was attending the TSP banquet in the restau
rant's private ballroom. More than 40 Daily Texan staff
ers came dressed in military fatigues as part of a 'Year of
the Terrorist' theme.
Scott was dressed in a sheik's robe with an alarm clock
and seven road flares taped to the clothing on his chest.
Curtis Weeks, spokesman for the Travis County
Sheriff, said Scott was arrested "because there was a
complaint."
"With the present-day world situation, people are a
little tense about bomb hoaxes," Weeks said. "They (the
arresting officers) found out at the scene that these were
just road flares," but were within their rights to arrest
Scott.
But Scott said the officers "ludicrously and laughably
overreacted" by making the arrest.
A bunch of ding-dongs
Freshmen at Stanford have it easy — all they have to
do to become sophomores is acquire 45 units. At Prince
ton, they have to steal the clapper from the Nassau Hall
bell tower.
Princeton frosh 'Ed' and 'Jedd' dodged a clanging bell
to earn their fellow classmates' rites of passage.
"Tradition was saved," Ed said. The two refused to
divulge their true identities, according to The Daily
Princetonian.
The clap per-nappe rs apparently disguised themselves
as construction workers and convinced a naive Nassau
Hall security officer to give them keys to the bell tower.
The security guard pleaded, "They looked like con
struction workers. They were scruffy and, oh, gee, I
don't believe this."
There was a brief moment of hysteria when, while still
unscrewing a bolt, one of the freshmen realized that the
bell was going to ring in 30 seconds. The two hurriedly
scampered down the tower's ladder and waited for the
bell to stop ringing before finishing their job.
They will "absolutely not" return the clapper to its
rightful owners, 'Jedd' told the Princetonian.
You sneaky little devils.

The Love Connection
Does your social life stink? Are you sitting at home
night after night with nothing to do but watch Baretta
reruns? If you had gone to the University of Michigan
instead of here you would dash over to your computer
terminal to alleviate the boredom.
A new computer privilege has allowed students to set
up a telecommunications conference. 'Confer-ing', as
they call it, enables students to discuss different topics or
'items' with others in the conference, via the computer.
One such item included is 'flirt'.
"You basically flirt with people you've never seen
(by) sending out leading messages," said Susie Jun, a
sophomore 'confer'. Once a month the confers are
allowed to meet the person on the other side of the com
puter "face-to-face," Jun said.
"The ratio of guys to girls (in the confer) is 8:1," said
Jun. "So whenever a girl gets on, she gets a lot of mail."
That's get on to the computer, folks.
Less than 60 percent of the confers are computer sci
ence or engineering majors. That is not imply that those
in these majors have worst social life, however correct it
may be. Instead, this statistic points out that
"teleconferencing and electronic mail are the only things

you can do on computers without knowing anything
about them," Jun explained.
One popular question among the confer-ers these
days is "When you're 'confer-ing,' do you prefer the act
or do you prefer cuddling?"
Jun thinks they prefer cuddling. "Doing the act re
quires too much concentration," she said. Yes, she said
this.
The Ann Arbor school instituted this program, which
'confers' see as "the wave of the future."
Maybe Baretta re-runs aren't so bad, after all.
Oops. . .
This one's so ingenious all by itself, it needs no edito
rial insertions. Here is most of the article as it was writ
ten in the Daily Texan:
