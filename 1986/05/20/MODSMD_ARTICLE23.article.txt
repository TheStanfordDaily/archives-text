# ASSU SPECIAL ELECTION SPRING 1986
## ATTENTION ALL STUDENTS... There will be a Special ASSU Election on Wednesday and Thursday, May 21 and 22 on the following issue. REFERENDUM 
### 
Statement in Favor
Sponsor: Richard Beigel, ASSU Senator
You may wonder "Why a special election?" Because the ASSU GOVERN
MENT HAS DECIDED TO TAKE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OF STUDENT ORGANI
ZATIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN PROFITS.
Vote YES to protect student organizations from the ASSU government. Most
student organizations make their own money from dues, donations and fund
raisers. Even though they receive no money from the ASSU, they are required
to deposit their money with the ASSU's banking service. The ASSU govern
ment proposes to pay student organizations only 4% interest on their savings
accounts. This is UNFAIR because student organizations are not given the op
tion of putting their money in another bank where anyone could get a higher
rate. YOUR YES VOTE WILL PREVENT THE ASSU FROM UNFAIRLY LOWERING
THE INTEREST RATE IT PAYS TO STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS. Your YES vote
will require that the ASSU continue to pay student organizations an interest
rate comparable to the rate available from other banks.
Opponents argue that the ASSU government needs the extra profits it can
make by lowering interest rates. In fact, the ASSU banking service will still net
$40,000 next year if this proposition is approved (the vast bulk of student or
ganization's money is in non-interest bearing checking accounts).
Because the University provides free office space and pays all banking ser
vice salaries and overhead, ASSU can compete better than other banks.
The cost of this proposition to the ASSU government will be about $5000 out
of a total operating budget of $100,000, which includes salaries of $5000 for
each COP member and $5000 for the senate chair. IF THE ASSU GOVERNMENT
CANNOT MANAGE TO MAKE ENDS MEET, IT CAN DIP INTO ITS $650,000
SAVINGS.
THIS PROPOSITION WILL NOT RESULT IN DECREASED ASSU FUNDING
FOR STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS, because student organization funding is
kept completely separate from the ASSU government's operating budget.
THIS PROPOSITION WILL NOT RESULT IN HIGHER ASSU FEES CHARGED
TO STUDENTS. The ASSU cannot charge any fees unless students vote to ap
prove those fees.
STUDENTS UNDERSTAND FAIRNESS. VOTE YES.
THIS PROPOSITION IS ENDORSED BY SMALL ORGANIZATIONS AND
LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES: KZSU, SACDF,
Theta Chi House, Stanford New York Cultural Association, The Bridge's trea
surer, Jay Alter (former Captain Big Way), Tim Quirk, Andi Frisch, Joel Bellen
son, Felix Cuevas, Don Gagliardi, Ben Garcia, Stacey Leyton, Lena
Slachmuijlder, Jeff Sloan, John van Loben Sels, Vivian Wu, Gina Hernandez,
Amanda Kemp.
This proposition is opposed by the outgoing ASS' I Senate.

Senate Summary
The ASSU runs a "banking" service for student organiza
tions, who are required by the University to "bank" with the
ASSU. The ASSU pays interest on student organizations'
savings accounts but not on checking accounts. The ASSU is
able to pay interest because it in turn re-invests the deposited
money in a large fund at a higher rate.
Current policies for interest on savings accounts are:
1. Regular savings: 4.5% below what the ASSU earns on
the money deposited with it.
2. $1000 minimum balance: 3.5% below the ASSU's
return.
3. $10,000 minimum balance: 1.5% below the ASSU's
return.
Because the ASSU is currently earning 10% on the
money it holds, the rates paid to student organizations
on their deposits are:
1. Regular savings: 5.5%
2. $1000 minimum balance: 6.5%
3. $10,000 minimum balance: 8.5%
This initiative would establish a policy that the rates that the
ASSU pays on the different types of savings accounts would be
"competitive" with rates available in the market. In other
words, the ASSU would pay out the same rate of interest that
student organizations could get on the outside for each type of
deposit. For each type of account, this rate could be less than,
equal to, or greater than the amount the ASSU was currently
taking in on the deposit. The specific numerical rates would be
set by the Senate but would have to conform to the condition
of "competitiveness."
The initiative sets beginning interest rates. It also requires
the offering of certificates of deposit.
This initiative would have the force of an act of the Senate
and could be amended or repealed in the future by a two
thirds vote of the Senate.

Statement Against
Sponsor: Jim DeLaHunt
Behind every headline, there's a story. You might think
this election is about a greedy, money-grubbing ASSU
against a lonely student group fighting for truth, justice,
and higher interest rates. In fact, this initiative is brought
to you by Richard Beigel, an influential ASSU Senator and
member of the Senate Steering Committee, who also
works at the Bridge. Compared to most student groups,
the Bridge has lots of money, and Richard wants them to
get more interest on it. Now the ASSU doesn't care if the
Bridge and similar groups put their money in real banks
with "competitive" interest rates, but the University for
bids that.
So, Richard asked the ASSU Senate to raise the SOF in
terest rates. The right committee of the Senate Met to
talk about it, and Richard didn't show until the third re
scheduling of the meeting. The committee put forward a
proposal that was a good compromise between competi
tive rates and SOF operation; Richard rejected it. He got
700 people to sign his petition, and now we have a $3,000
election.
Last Spring, Richard ran a "Dump McGrath" smear
campaign against then-Senator Jim McGrath. The next
Fall, he ran a "Thank you Jim McGrath" campaign. Over
the summer, he had worked with McGrath and realized
he had been dead wrong. I think this election is just more
Spring madness. Let's vote NO and maybe it will go away.
