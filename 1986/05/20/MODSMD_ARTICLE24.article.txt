to Student Groups that are Forced to Bank with the ASSU
The following shall be added to the Financial policy on accounts offered by the Student Organizations Fund,
and all conflicting provisions shall be deleted from that Policy: The Student Organizations Fund shall offer
savings accounts, money-market savings accounts, and one-year certificates of deposit to the student organiza

interest-bearing accounts, except long-term certificates of deposit; withdrawls from certificates of deposit shall
result in the forfeit of six-months' interest.
Initially, the interest rate on savings accounts shall be five and one-half percent, the interest rate on money
market accounts with a minimum balance of one thousand dollars shall be six and one-half percent, and the in
terest rate on one-year fixed-rate certificates of deposit shall be eight percent.
