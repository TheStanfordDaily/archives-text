I. What exectly is the Student Organization Fund (SOF)?
The SOF is the sum of all of the expendable funds deposited with the ASSU. This includes the funds of all student organizations as well as all
of the ASSU's expendable income which is used to cover operating expenses. In addition, the SOF provides a variety of "banking" services
to student groups, including check writing, deposit, savings account, and payroll services. A copier, postage machine, typewriter, and
working space are also made available to student organizations through the SOF.
As mentioned above, all of the ASSU's operating funds are linked to the SOF. However, the SOF is only one source of the total operating
budget.
II. Where does the ASSU's expendable income come from, then?
The ASSU has a total operating budget of approximately $307,519.00. The expenses covered in this budget include the Boathouse, office ex
penses, salaries, the elections and nomination commissions, the ASSU News, facilities improvements, and Senate and COP expenses, of
these budgeted expenses, the University contributes $182,251.00 for banking and certain other expenditures. $27,000 is budgeted to come
from short-term interest earned on the SOF, and the remaining $98,267 is budgeted to come from business project profits and from fixed
overhead income.
III. What would happen to the operating budget of the ASSU if the proposed changes were effected?
If the SOF pays the proposed "competitive"rates (i.e. the same rates that it earns on most savings accounts), the expendable funds that it
earns could be eliminated entirely. At best, under the assumption that no organization transferred money presently in checking accounts to
interest-bearing savings accounts upon the implementation of this new policy, the SOF would lose $5000 in short term interest. This $5000
would have to be cut directly from the ASSU operating expenses. However, many groups might, in fact, choose to transfer all of their funds
from non-interest checking accounts to savings accounts which still allow three withdrawls a month while paying interest. Since many groups
never exceed three withdrawls a month, there would be nothing to deter them from keeping all of their money in savings accounts. Under
such circumstances, the SOF risks losing all of its short-term interest earnings, and thereby risks having to cut $27,000 from the ASSU operat
ing budget.
IV. In concrete terms, what chaiges would be seen in operating expenses of this $5,000 - $27,000 budget cut takes place?
Salaries would most likely be the hardest hit of any items in the operating expenses, since they are a variable cost. At present, minimal com
pensation is provided to the Council of Presidents, the Senate Chair, and the ASSU Administrative Manager in the operating budget. COP
members are paid approximately $5,000, Senate Chair is paid approximately $5,000, and the Administrative Manager is paid approximately
$2,500. These salaries are administered for a 12-month, 30-50 hour a week commitment (This is comparable to the salaries of the chief staff of
the Daily.).
