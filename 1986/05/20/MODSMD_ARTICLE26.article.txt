# Senate Recommendation: NO
## 
### 
On the face of it, making SOF interest rates "competitive" sounds pretty good. But in fact, this initiative is a rotten idea.
1. This initiative benefits only those student groups with a lot of money - essentially, it affects interest rates on the large over-$l,OOO accounts that
few groups can afford, but doesn't affect the basic savings account rate.
2. Yes, the ASSU gets the money from SOF interest. The ASSU makes its money the old-fashioned way, by earning it. The $16 "ASSU fees" on your
PTR go entirely to student groups with a small overhead to pay for the cost of elections and administration. ASSU salaries, office expenses, and
so on are paid by the University, the SOF interest, and profits from Sunday Flicks. Many universities charge students a "government fee" to pay
costs like these. Would you rather have a few hundred dollars more interest for a few rich groups - and an extra fee on your PTR, or higher tui
tion to pay for a larger University subsidy?
3. If the SOF has to pay interest "competitive" with real banks, it might have to start charging fees like real banks. The SOF now allows overdrafts
and interest-free loans, for instance if a group is waiting for a University funding cheque to come through. There are no charges for bounced
cheque requests. SOF staff provide free counseling. And the SOF keeps copies of old cheques and receipts available to the group for years.
(Banks do too, but they charge $3 per cheque to copy them.) And if groups want, the SOF will invest their money in South Africa-free funds,
from which the SOF guaranteed interest. The initiative ignores all these differences in its quest for "competitiveness."
4. SOF policies are complex, and sledgehammer approaches like this initiative cause more problems than they solve. The Senate has changes in
the works to make the SOF pay higher interest rates, but one ASSU Senator thinks they aren't a good enough deal for the wealthy group he
represents, and he doesn't want to compromise.
5. This election costs more than $3,000, three quarters of which will come off your PTRs, just to give a few hundred extra dollars annually to the few
student groups who can afford high-interest accounts and to satisfy one person's desire to have his way. That's democracy, but its also a waste of
everyone's time and money.
The Senate urges you to vote NO on this initiative.
