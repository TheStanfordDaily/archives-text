## Money is sweet music to a small band's ears 
### SCOTT SAN FILIPPO Staff writer 
This is the story of two bands. Or
rather, the story of two types of
bands.
The Visit is a campus band that
performs only original songs. They
have performed at several clubs in
San Francisco as well as at the
Keystone in Palo Alto. They recently
recorded songs for a record they hope
to release soon.
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins,
formerly the Altar Boys, have a quite
different way of doing things. Their
repertoire consists of virtually all
cover songs — popular songs re
corded by other artists — and they
perform at parties and dances, mostly
on campus.
Marty Bedoian, lead singer for The
Visit, summed up the financial differ
ences of the two types of bands quite
well. "You get paid a lot more for
playing other people's music," he
said.
For original bands around the
country, the sad truth is that money is
hard to come by unless they compro
mise by playing songs made popular
by other bands. Bands will usually
play a mix of their own songs with se
lected cover songs until they can at
tract an audience on the strength of
their own songs alone. Club owners
do not want to gamble their money
on an unknown band with unknown
material.
For a typical performance on
campus, a cover band would get paid
around $450. Proms or other special
functions could net a band up to
$1,000. An unproven original band in
the city, such as The Visit, might be
lucky to make just $100.
Unless a band is established, the
money it makes from a performance
at a club usually comes from a
percentage of the money collected as
cover charge at the door. On a typical
night, this cover charge will be
divided among three or four bands.
A club might also make the band
sell its own tickets to earn money.
This way the club has nothing to lose
— the band makes money only from
the tickets they sell and the club has

no financial responsibility.
Behind every band is a small
fortune in equipment. Each individ
ual guitarist can easily spend between
$500 and $700 for a guitar and amp.
A drummer can buy a simple kit for
as little as $350, but a full kit could
cost as much as $900. Cymbals alone
can cost from $70 to $200 each.
Of course, prices vary widely, and
low-budget instruments are easy to
find. Most will sound low budget,
though. Serious musicians who buy
top-quality equipment can usually ex
pect to spend the prices mentioned
above.
Many bands also finance their own
PA system, although this is less likely
for club bands. A typical PA system
includes a mixing board, power amps,
speaker enclosures, a monitor system
and microphones. Other sound rein
forcement components can also be
added, such as graphic equalizers,
digital delays or compressors.

Financing a PA system takes a
heavy toll on a band account. The
cables that connect the system can
cost $200-$3OO alone. A small sys
tem, such as the one Merv Spiegel
and the Penguins bought — a six
channel board, amps, two speakers,
and two monitors — costs around
$1,000.
A larger system would consist of a
12 or 16-channel mixing board
($BOO-$2,000), 1,200 watts of power
(usually two amps, $700-sl,ooo
total), a speaker system ($6OO
- and microphones ($7O-$ 150
each). A monitor system, which is
similar to a mini-PA system, could
cost $400-$ 1,500, depending on how
sophisticated it is. The total cost for
this system, which would be adequate
for any party as well as small clubs,
would be about $3,000-$4,000.
A complete, top-quality system
with effects, equalization and full

miking ability (provide microphones
for all voices and instruments), would
start at $5,000. In reality, a system
can continue to grow as long as
money is poured into it.
Most club bands need not worry
about a PA system. Usually the club
has a house PA. The band just needs
to show up with their instruments and
plug in. Expenses for a club band
usually includes travel and promo
tion. Many times a band will play for
free in order to gain exposure — es
pecially if the performance guaran
tees a large audience.
Once an audience is established, a
band has more power with club
owners and can demand higher
wages. In Boston or Los Angeles, the
small band capitals of the nation, a
well-known band might be paid
$500-$ 1,000 a night for a set of
music. Typically they would already
have a record released locally, and
would attract a very large audience.
Releasing a record is also a costly
process. Any band can release a
record if they have enough money. A
recording contract is not necessary.
After a band has established itself lo
cally by playing clubs, the next step

might be to release a record.
The first step is to record the songs.
This is the most costly process in the
making of a record. Studio time for a
small band ranges from $10/ hour up
to $150/ hour.
After recording, the next process is
to have the tape mastered and
pressed. To press a total of 1,000
singles, a pressing plant charges
$400-$6OO. The main cost comes in
the mastering of the record. To press
another 1,000 records would be much
cheaper.
Making money off a record means
getting it into stores. If a band is
signed with a major label, the record
will be found everywhere. Indepen
dent labels also have a lot of power in
getting their records in stores. Most
unsigned bands try to sign with these
labels first. Independent labels dis
tribute the record to stores around
the country as well as to radio sta
tions.
Once a band has a record out, the
story starts again. If the record is dis
tributed nationally, the band hits the
road to promote it. Unlike major
label bands, however, each city they
play will be a new audience, which
means less money. It's a long road to
the top.
For those that do make it to the
top, the price of mixing boards,
speakers, guitars and drum sets
quickly becomes inconsequential.
Bay Area bands that have made it
big, like Huey Lewis and the News,
The Greg Kihn Band and Eddie and
the Tide gross hundreds of thousands
of dollars each year. Then the costs
they have to worry about are back
stage catering costs, limousine rental
and video production.
Because the odds of a small band
making it big are miniscule, most
bands play because they enjoy it, not
because they aspire to make a great
deal of money. Bedoin remarked, "I
just like it, that's why I do it. It's
really cool when you stand up there,
and somebody who is listening to you
tells you he really liked it." For some,
like Bedoian, music is more impor
tant than money.

low-budget instruments are easy to
find. Most will sound low budget,
though. Serious musicians who buy
top-quality equipment can usually ex
pect to spend the prices mentioned
above.
Many bands also finance their own
PA system, although this is less likely
for club bands. A typical PA system
includes a mixing board, power amps,
speaker enclosures, a monitor system
and microphones. Other sound rein
forcement components can also be
added, such as graphic equalizers,
digital delays or compressors.

Financing a PA system takes a
heavy toll on a band account. The
cables that connect the system can
cost $200-$3OO alone. A small sys
tem, such as the one Merv Spiegel
and the Penguins bought — a six
channel board, amps, two speakers,
and two monitors — costs around
$1,000.
A larger system would consist of a
12 or 16-channel mixing board
($BOO-$2,000), 1,200 watts of power
(usually two amps, $700-sl,ooo
total), a speaker system ($6OO
- and microphones ($7O-$ 150
each). A monitor system, which is
similar to a mini-PA system, could
cost $400-$ 1,500, depending on how
sophisticated it is. The total cost for
this system, which would be adequate
for any party as well as small clubs,
would be about $3,000-$4,000.
A complete, top-quality system
with effects, equalization and full

miking ability (provide microphones
for all voices and instruments), would
start at $5,000. In reality, a system
can continue to grow as long as
money is poured into it.
Most club bands need not worry
about a PA system. Usually the club
has a house PA. The band just needs
to show up with their instruments and
plug in. Expenses for a club band
usually includes travel and promo
tion. Many times a band will play for
free in order to gain exposure — es
pecially if the performance guaran
tees a large audience.
Once an audience is established, a
band has more power with club
owners and can demand higher
wages. In Boston or Los Angeles, the
small band capitals of the nation, a
well-known band might be paid
$500-$ 1,000 a night for a set of
music. Typically they would already
have a record released locally, and
would attract a very large audience.
Releasing a record is also a costly
process. Any band can release a
record if they have enough money. A
recording contract is not necessary.
After a band has established itself lo
cally by playing clubs, the next step

might be to release a record.
The first step is to record the songs.
This is the most costly process in the
making of a record. Studio time for a
small band ranges from $10/ hour up
to $150/ hour.
After recording, the next process is
to have the tape mastered and
pressed. To press a total of 1,000
singles, a pressing plant charges
$400-$6OO. The main cost comes in
the mastering of the record. To press
another 1,000 records would be much
cheaper.
Making money off a record means
getting it into stores. If a band is
signed with a major label, the record
will be found everywhere. Indepen
dent labels also have a lot of power in
getting their records in stores. Most
unsigned bands try to sign with these
labels first. Independent labels dis
tribute the record to stores around
the country as well as to radio sta
tions.
Once a band has a record out, the
story starts again. If the record is dis
tributed nationally, the band hits the
road to promote it. Unlike major
label bands, however, each city they
play will be a new audience, which
means less money. It's a long road to
the top.
For those that do make it to the
top, the price of mixing boards,
speakers, guitars and drum sets
quickly becomes inconsequential.
Bay Area bands that have made it
big, like Huey Lewis and the News,
The Greg Kihn Band and Eddie and
the Tide gross hundreds of thousands
of dollars each year. Then the costs
they have to worry about are back
stage catering costs, limousine rental
and video production.
Because the odds of a small band
making it big are miniscule, most
bands play because they enjoy it, not
because they aspire to make a great
deal of money. Bedoin remarked, "I
just like it, that's why I do it. It's
really cool when you stand up there,
and somebody who is listening to you
tells you he really liked it." For some,
like Bedoian, music is more impor
tant than money.

Campus bands like the now-defunct Kartoonz have to invest a lot of money before they can pump out quality
music.

This is the story of two bands. Or
rather, the story of two types of
bands.
The Visit is a campus band that
performs only original songs. They
have performed at several clubs in
San Francisco as well as at the
Keystone in Palo Alto. They recently
recorded songs for a record they hope
to release soon.
Merv Spiegel and the Penguins,
formerly the Altar Boys, have a quite
different way of doing things. Their
repertoire consists of virtually all
cover songs — popular songs re
corded by other artists — and they
perform at parties and dances, mostly
on campus.
Marty Bedoian, lead singer for The
Visit, summed up the financial differ
ences of the two types of bands quite
well. "You get paid a lot more for
playing other people's music," he
said.
For original bands around the
country, the sad truth is that money is
hard to come by unless they compro
mise by playing songs made popular
by other bands. Bands will usually
play a mix of their own songs with se
lected cover songs until they can at
tract an audience on the strength of
their own songs alone. Club owners
do not want to gamble their money
on an unknown band with unknown
material.
For a typical performance on
campus, a cover band would get paid
around $450. Proms or other special
functions could net a band up to
$1,000. An unproven original band in
the city, such as The Visit, might be
lucky to make just $100.
Unless a band is established, the
money it makes from a performance
at a club usually comes from a
percentage of the money collected as
cover charge at the door. On a typical
night, this cover charge will be
divided among three or four bands.
A club might also make the band
sell its own tickets to earn money.
This way the club has nothing to lose
— the band makes money only from
the tickets they sell and the club has

no financial responsibility.
Behind every band is a small
fortune in equipment. Each individ
ual guitarist can easily spend between
$500 and $700 for a guitar and amp.
A drummer can buy a simple kit for
as little as $350, but a full kit could
cost as much as $900. Cymbals alone
can cost from $70 to $200 each.
Of course, prices vary widely, and
low-budget instruments are easy to
find. Most will sound low budget,
though. Serious musicians who buy
top-quality equipment can usually ex
