## Everyone's 'Waiting for Godot' 
### SPARK LIPSKY Staff writer 
Stanford went into a mild uproar
last week over the Drama Depart
ment's production of Samuel Be
ckett's "Waiting for Godot." Critical
and audience reaction to the play,
which has often been called the single
greatest piece of drama in the 20th
century, ranged from standing
ovations to thorough disgust.
The play, which premiered in Paris
over 30 years ago, has a long history
of controversy. Beginning as a work
ridiculed for its lack of plot, character
development or any other tradition
ally acceptable element of "good
drama," "Godot" has slowly gained
popularity around the world as the
quintessential existentialist play. It is
presently considered a modern classic
and is required reading in Stanford's
Western Culture program.
The play revolves around two men,
Didi and Gogo, waiting by a road to
meet their associate, Godot. Several
people come by and speak to the
men, but Godot never appears. The
action of the play consists of the pair's
attempts to "pass the time" with as
little anxiety and boredom as possi
ble. The possibilities of conversation,
game-playing, sleep and even suicide
are explored. The situation at the end
is identical to the beginning. As one
critic points out, the play is not about
Godot, but about waiting.
Although there was no physical
violence at the shows last week, a
full-fledged war of words between
critics has broken out. Both their
comments and those of audience
members are reprinted below as a
guide for individuals considering an
outing to the theater.
" 'To be or not to be?' asked Ham
let in the 17th century. 'What are we
doing here, that is the question' is the
modern rendition asked by a certain
'existential' character. Yes, this is the
confused, uncertain world of Samuel
Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot,' won
derfully recreated on the Little
Theater stage by director Wendy Par
sons. It is worth seeing by anybody
who likes 'old wine in new bottles,' as
Christianity and the whole of West
ern civilization is captured and con
densed into an intense two-hour show
about the plight of the modern man."
- Rich Frank, New York Times
"The show is a wonderful mix of
circus comedy and highbrow philoso
phy, a proof that 'serious art' does not
have to be solely an experience of the
head, but one of the belly as well."
-Bernard Whiner, S.F. Chronicle
"I found Parsons' production
to be fully satisfying, one that brought

out the profound anxiety, the central
neuroses, the total breakdown of cer
tainty that characterizes our age. The
despair, depression and hopelessness
of life has never been so vividly
captured for me. It was a wonderful
evening out."
-J.P. Camus, Essential Living
"Wow! Five stars for 'Waiting for
Godot'!! One of the year's 10 best!!

Critical and audience reactions to the
play ranged from standing ovations to
thorough disgust.

A definite must-see for the whole
family!"

"The show wavered greatly, going
from the interesting to the dull. It
might have been pace, it might have
been the play, but in any case half the
time I was captivated and the other
half I was adjusting my seat. Never
theless, a commendable production
for a most difficult show, particularly
for the relaxed performance of Mi-

chael Alves as Gogo."
- Steve Vineberg,
Uptight Intellectual Quarterly
"What we have here is some excel
lent staging and insightful design on
the part of Parsons. In the first
act we see the road with a low curtain,
giving the effect of a wide-screen
cinema. In the second act, the curtain
is raised entirely and the road is

reversed, the curtain completely
raised, revealing all the backstage
lights. We are forced to make a com
parison between life and theater. Are
we an audience, or are we backstage?
Or are we too, as Didi intimates,
being watched by others, we our
selves a spectacle for others to laugh
at? This play-life metaphor is implicit
in Beckett's text, and sophisticatedly
brought out by Parsons' produc
tion."
- Steven Spielberg

"The Stanford Drama Department
is just getting better and better. The
grad students have displayed confi
dence and inspiration in their direct
ing all year. First the sizzling 'Top
Girls'snd the classic 'School for
Women,' and now the haunting
'Waiting for Godot.' It has been an
excellent year for theater on campus
and I eagerly anticipate next week's
opening at the Nitery — Shake
speare's 'Two Noble Kinsmen' — to
continue the high production
quality."
-Dawn Kennedy, Local Aesthete
Student reactions:
"I loved it. I don't know why, it was
just really well acted and really inter
esting. It's not what I normally think
of theater as, but it was really good.
And funny."
"I just couldn't get into it, you
know? I guess it's too intellectual for
me or something. I mean, like, who is
Godot supposed to represent?"
"I loved the blend of comedy and
philosophy. There were boring
points, but I thought it was the play,
not the actors. I really liked Gian
carlo Ferruzi, the nervous one, when
he was trying to sing. But they didn't
drop their pants! When I read it their
pants kept falling down, but they cut
it from the show. I was bummed."
"I'm so happy I came. It's the first
time I ever liked something that was
avant-garde. You know what I mean?
Like everyone says its really heavy
and philosophical, but I just laughed.
I don't know about all this existential
stuff, but I think it's really entertain
ing."
"It was terrible. When I saw it on
Broadway in the '50s it was much
better, and both were terrible
compared to the time I saw it in Lon
don. It's way too funny, too broad, to
be really moving in the way Beckett
intended. The point is to be de
pressed, isn't it?"
The reactions, obviously, are
mixed. Some enjoy the philosophy
and prick up their ears at lines like
"Such is life." Others leave their ana
lytical skills at home and enjoy the
laughs. Some do both. Others do nei
ther. It is a play which every audience
member or critic, real or fictitious,
must decide about on his own.
"Waiting for Godot" plays through
Saturday at the Little Theater
(between the Business School and
Mem Aud). Student tickets are $4.
