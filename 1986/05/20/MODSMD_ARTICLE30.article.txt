# 'Blue City': a dud for all seasons
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"Blue City" has it all: ob
noxious, inane characters doing
stupid things that aren't even
remotely plausible. This is a movie
in which we find out that the os
tensible hero, impersonated by
Judd Nelson, has spent the entire
time harassing and killing the
wrong people (the minions of a
sleazy but relatively harmless vice
king), and the moviemakers don't
see any irony in this. (Presumably
this was presented as ironic in the
original Ross Macdonald novel, or
else neither the book nor the
movie would have any point.)
The hero's motive for his mis
guided spree of vengeance is the
murder of his father, but Nelson is

so busy trying to exude a hard
bitten toughness that he has no
time for emotions; whenever his
character thinks about his dead
father, he looks vaguely put out,
and stares into the middle distance
for a while. Towards the end of the
movie the hero needs a motiva
tional boost, so of course his best
friend gets killed. (This guy goes
through the movie with "dead
meat" tatooed on his forehead.)
The only character I somewhat
liked — a police chief played by
Paul Winfield — turns out to be
the villian (I'm giving away the
plot here as a public service, so no
one will entertain any delusions
about going to see this stinker),
and I was fervently hoping he'd
blow away Judd Nelson in the final
scenes. I also thought that maybe

Ally Sheedy's character (who is
very confused) would kill him
when she found out he'd as much
as caused her brother's death. No
such luck.
Michelle Manning directed
"Blue City" with considerably less
competence than is called for; she
uses lots of harshly lit close-ups
which, when combined with a
soundtrack that is far too loud,
gave me a headache. Even more
depressing is the fact that Walter
Hill produced and co-wrote (with
Lucas Heller) this drivel. Hill has
had the worst decline of any
talented writer/director in recent
memory; incredibly, it began right
after he'd acheived his biggest
commercial success (with "48
Hrs."), and it shows no signs of
abating. Hill seems to be flailing

about for "commercial" projects,
and has completely abandoned
whatever instincts guided him
through his string of artistic suc
cesses in the late '70s and early
'80s. Hill has gone so wrong that I
can't even recognize him as the
same filmmaker who made those
movies.
There are exactly two very
minor things that are somewhat
enjoyable in "Blue City": the
music is by Ry Cooder, which
means that it's listenable (though
for Cooder, very uninspired), and
Ally Sheedy has one good scene in
which she practically leaps out of
her slinky little dress. For a few
brief moments, she's pure teenage
super-vixen, and her energy level
blows Judd Nelson and everything
else off the screen.
