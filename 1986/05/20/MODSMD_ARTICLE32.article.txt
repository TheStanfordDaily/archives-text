## Stanford stuns UCLA in semifinals Waves are final foe for Card 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga — Last week when
Stanford Coach Dick Gould was
asked what team he thought would
win the NCAA Men's Tennis Cham
pionship, he made one concise state
ment: "I wouldn't bet against a Cali
fornia team — ever."
He was right.
The only thing that is certain about
today's championship final is that a
California team will win it. Fifth
seeded Pepperdine and sixth-seeded
Stanford will meet on the courts of
Henry Field Stadium in what is
shaping up to be a high-quality tennis
showdown.
Both teams not only upset their
semifinal opponents, they blew them
out. Pepperdine, led by the red-hot
play of senior Kelly Jones and sopho
more Robbie Weiss, destroyed top
seeded SMU by a 5-1 score.
In the past two days, Jones has
defeated the nation's top-ranked
singles player, Rick Leach of USC
and No. 12 John Ross of SMU. Weiss
has beaten No. 6 Luke Jensen of USC
and No. 3 Richey Reneberg of SMU.
On the other side of the net will be
a Stanford squad which has upended
the two teams that many people here
favored to win it all. The Cardinal
beat third-seeded Clemson 5-3 and
routed second seed UCLA 5-1.
Today's match will be the third be
tween the two teams. At Stanford,
the Cardinal defeated the Waves,
who were playing without Weiss, by a
5-4 score. Earlier in the year, Pep
perdine beat the Cardinal 5-1 at the
National Indoor Team Champion
ships, but Jim Grabb was out of the
lineup for Stanford.
Today, both teams will be com
pletely healthy, with the exception of
Pepperdine's Dani Leal, who is suf
fering from a case of professionalitis.

Stanford's Dan Goldie led the upset over UCLA yesterday by dismantling the Bruins' Brad Pearce 6-4, 6-1.
Goldie had lost his previous two meetings with Pearce this season but bounced back to lead his team into the
NCAA finals for the third time in four years.
