## Stanford stuns UCLA in semifinals Waves are final foe for Card 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga — Last week when
Stanford Coach Dick Gould was
asked what team he thought would
win the NCAA Men's Tennis Cham
pionship, he made one concise state
ment: "I wouldn't bet against a Cali
fornia team — ever."
He was right.
The only thing that is certain about
today's championship final is that a
California team will win it. Fifth
seeded Pepperdine and sixth-seeded
Stanford will meet on the courts of
Henry Field Stadium in what is
shaping up to be a high-quality tennis
showdown.
Both teams not only upset their
semifinal opponents, they blew them
out. Pepperdine, led by the red-hot
play of senior Kelly Jones and sopho
more Robbie Weiss, destroyed top
seeded SMU by a 5-1 score.
In the past two days, Jones has
defeated the nation's top-ranked
singles player, Rick Leach of USC
and No. 12 John Ross of SMU. Weiss
has beaten No. 6 Luke Jensen of USC
and No. 3 Richey Reneberg of SMU.
On the other side of the net will be
a Stanford squad which has upended
the two teams that many people here
favored to win it all. The Cardinal
beat third-seeded Clemson 5-3 and
routed second seed UCLA 5-1.
Today's match will be the third be
tween the two teams. At Stanford,
the Cardinal defeated the Waves,
who were playing without Weiss, by a
5-4 score. Earlier in the year, Pep
perdine beat the Cardinal 5-1 at the
National Indoor Team Champion
ships, but Jim Grabb was out of the
lineup for Stanford.
Today, both teams will be com
pletely healthy, with the exception of
Pepperdine's Dani Leal, who is suf
fering from a case of professionalitis.

Stanford's Dan Goldie led the upset over UCLA yesterday by dismantling the Bruins' Brad Pearce 6-4, 6-1.
Goldie had lost his previous two meetings with Pearce this season but bounced back to lead his team into the
NCAA finals for the third time in four years.
through the season. Leal's absence
may be a blessing in disguise, as Pep
perdine's Craig Johnson, who took
his place into the lineup, has won all
three of his tourney matches.
The Cardinal player that Johnson
will have to face in the No. 6 singles
match is junior Scott Moody. Moody
has also won all three of his tourney
matches, and those wins have been
crucial for the Stanford team.

"I think the key to what we've
done so far has been all Moody,"
Gould said.
Senior Eric Rosenfeld has also
been instrumental in Stanford's vic
tories.
Pepperdine played most of its
match with USC on Sunday indoors
because of rain, and, with a chance of
rain for today, Gould is worried
about playing inside.
"What scares me now is that we
might have to go indoors, " he said.
"We haven't played there, and (they)
have."

Gould may wish that Henry Field
Stadium was his home court all year
round — he has a better record there
then he does at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium. In the nine years since 1977
that Stanford has been invited to the
tourney, the Cardinal team has won
five times, has been runner-up once
and has compiled an overall record of
30-3.
"That's a pretty amazing record in
championship competition," Gould
said yesterday. "Geez, that's
amazing. But the 31st is the most im
portant."
