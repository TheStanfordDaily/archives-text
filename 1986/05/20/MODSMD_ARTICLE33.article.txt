### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga — Either someone
forgot to give UCLA a wakeup call
yesterday morning, or Stanford has
been hustling the Bruins all year.
The sixth-seeded Cardinal, which
had lost to UCLA twice during the
regular season by 5-4 and 7-2 scores,
stunned the Bruins by winning five
out of six singles matches to clinch a
semifinals victory in the NCAA
Men's Tennis Championships here.
The unexpected 5-1

victory over the
second-seeded Bruins
propelled the Card
inal into the champi
onship match against
Pepperdine today at
noon EST. Pep
perdine advanced to
the finals by upsetting
the No. 1-seeded
SMU Mustangs 5-1 in
yesterday's afternoon
semifinal.
Earlier in the day,

Stanford put aside any
bad memories of UCLA and came
out gunning for the Bruins from the
opening serves.
The Cardinal jumped to a 3-0 lead
in just under an hour-and-20-minutes.
Seniors Eric Rosenfeld, Jim Grabb
and Dan Goldie each won convinc
ingly in straight sets over the shell
shocked trio of Dan Nahirney, Mi
chael Kures and Brad Pearce,
respectively.
UCLA got a glimmer of hope after
Brett Greenwood finished off Stan
ford's John Letts in No. 5 singles, 7-5,
6-2. Cardinal sophomore Patrick
McEnroe soon put the scare back in
the Bruins by beating Tim Trigueiro
7-6 (8-6), 6-3.
With Stanford leading 4-1, the ten
sion moved to the No. 6 singles match
where Cardinal Scott Moody was en
gaged in a pivotal three-set match for
the second day in a row. Moody split
the first two sets with Bruin freshman
Buff Farrow and was down a break at
2-4 in the third.
But Moody responded to the
cheers of his teammates by breaking

Yesterday's results

Goldie (S) d. Pearce 6-4, 6-1

McEnroe (S) d. Trigueiro 7-6 (8-6), 6-3
Rosenleld (S) d. Nahirney 6-3, 6-2
Greenwood (UCLA) d. Letts 7-5, 6-2
Moody (S) d. Farrow 3-6, 6-3, 6-4
Doubles were called off as the match
was already decided.

Farrow twice and holding twice to
clinch the match and close the lid on
the Bruin coffin.
"Scott's been coming through for
us all tournament," McEnroe said af
terwards. "I guess he loses a lot of
first sets, hut he pulled it out again
today. I don't think he knew the
(team's) score at the time."
Nobody, including the Cardinal
and the Bruins, thought Stanford
would win it in the singles.
"We really didn't expect it from
them," UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett
said. "Not from what

we saw in the two
matches with them
this year, but we've
got no excuses."
Stanford Coach
Dick Gould was more
philosophical about
the victory. "I thought
we had a real good
chance to win any of
the top four singles
matches. Greenie
(Greenwood) is al
ways tough against

against us, and 1
thought before the match that Scott
matched up pretty well against Far
row," he said. "But then again that
also means UCLA has a chance to
win any of those. It could have gone
5-1 either way."
"We weren't thinking about it
(winning in singles)," Goldie said.
"We expected a 5-4 match all the
way."
Goldie and Grabb, who both lost in
Sunday's team victory over Clemson,
came out firing against their Bruin
opponents yesterday.
"We just wanted to go out and hit
hard. We were a little tentative yes
terday," Goldie said.
Grabb found his big serve and took
away the passing angles from Kures.
The Stanford team captain ended the
match with two straight aces to cap
off a 6-2, 6-2 win.
On the court next to Grabb's,
meanwhile, Goldie was avenging two
regular season losses to Bruin sopho
more Pearce. Goldie took the first set
6-4 and breezed through the second
6-1.
"1 returned pretty well, and my
serve was on," Goldie said.
For the second day in a row Rosen
feld put in such a quiet, workmanlike
effort in the No. 4 singles match that
he didn't get much attention. Yester
day, his victim was Nahirney, who
went down to defeat in an hour and
seven minutes by a 6-3, 6-2 score.
In the No. 3 singles, even though
McEnroe won in straight sets, the
match was tense throughout.
"There was a stretch in there where
he (Trigueiro) served seven aces in
two games," McEnroe said. "All
match I felt that if I could just get the
ball back I'd be in good shape for the
point."
The entire Stanford squad looks to
be in good shape going into today's
championship match.
"I definitely think everyone is hit
ting the ball well," McEnroe said yes
terday. "Everyone is confident, and if
we get beat tomorrow, we're going to
go down swinging."

"Scott's been coming through for
us all tournament," McEnroe said af
terwards. "I guess he loses a lot of
first sets, hut he pulled it out again
today. I don't think he knew the
(team's) score at the time."
Nobody, including the Cardinal
and the Bruins, thought Stanford
would win it in the singles.
"We really didn't expect it from
them," UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett
said. "Not from what

we saw in the two
matches with them
this year, but we've
got no excuses."
Stanford Coach
Dick Gould was more
philosophical about
the victory. "I thought
we had a real good
chance to win any of
the top four singles
matches. Greenie
(Greenwood) is al
ways tough against

against us, and 1
thought before the match that Scott
matched up pretty well against Far
row," he said. "But then again that
also means UCLA has a chance to
win any of those. It could have gone
5-1 either way."
"We weren't thinking about it
(winning in singles)," Goldie said.
"We expected a 5-4 match all the
way."
Goldie and Grabb, who both lost in
Sunday's team victory over Clemson,
came out firing against their Bruin
opponents yesterday.
"We just wanted to go out and hit
hard. We were a little tentative yes
terday," Goldie said.
Grabb found his big serve and took
away the passing angles from Kures.
The Stanford team captain ended the
match with two straight aces to cap
off a 6-2, 6-2 win.
On the court next to Grabb's,
meanwhile, Goldie was avenging two
regular season losses to Bruin sopho
more Pearce. Goldie took the first set
6-4 and breezed through the second
6-1.
"1 returned pretty well, and my
serve was on," Goldie said.
For the second day in a row Rosen
feld put in such a quiet, workmanlike
effort in the No. 4 singles match that
he didn't get much attention. Yester
day, his victim was Nahirney, who
went down to defeat in an hour and
seven minutes by a 6-3, 6-2 score.
In the No. 3 singles, even though
McEnroe won in straight sets, the
match was tense throughout.
"There was a stretch in there where
he (Trigueiro) served seven aces in
two games," McEnroe said. "All
match I felt that if I could just get the
ball back I'd be in good shape for the
point."
The entire Stanford squad looks to
be in good shape going into today's
championship match.
"I definitely think everyone is hit
ting the ball well," McEnroe said yes
terday. "Everyone is confident, and if
we get beat tomorrow, we're going to
go down swinging."

bad memories of UCLA and came
out gunning for the Bruins from the
opening serves.
The Cardinal jumped to a 3-0 lead
in just under an hour-and-20-minutes.
Seniors Eric Rosenfeld, Jim Grabb
and Dan Goldie each won convinc
ingly in straight sets over the shell
shocked trio of Dan Nahirney, Mi

respectively.
UCLA got a glimmer of hope after
Brett Greenwood finished off Stan
ford's John Letts in No. 5 singles, 7-5,
