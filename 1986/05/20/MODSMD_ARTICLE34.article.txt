# Batsmen sent east to Oklahoma for Midwest Regional
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
There will be no more baseball
played at Sunken Diamond this
year.
After a seven-hour phone con
versation yesterday between the
NCAA's six regional representa
tives — among them Mark
Marquess, Stanford's coach — the
NCAA released a complete list of
the sites for this weekend's eight
postseason regionals. Stanford was
not on the list.

Regional sites and pairing*
Midwest at Oklahoma St.
Stanford — Appalachian St.
Arkansas — Oregon St.
Richmond — Oklahoma St.
Central at Texas
Pepperdlne — Pan American
Arizona — San Diego St,
East Carolina/Southern Illinois — Texas
South I at LSU
Oklahoma — Eastern Kentucky
Tulane — Louisiana Tech
Jackson St. — LSU
South II at Florida St.
South Florida — Texas A&M/Baylor
North Carolina St. — Florida St.
West at UCLA
Loyola-Marymount — UCSB
Hawaii — UCLA
Northwest at Maine
St. Johns — Rider
Rutgers — Maine
Mideast at Michigan
Oral Roberts — Central Michigan
Indiana St. — Michigan
Atlantic at Miami
Georgia Tech — Navy
Alabama — South Carolina
West Carolina — Miami

Oklahoma State will host the
Midwest Regional; Texas the
Central; Maine the Northwest;
Florida State one of the two
Southern affairs; Michigan the
Mideast; and Miami, the defend
ing national champion, the Atlan
tic.
Louisiana State was named last
Monday as the host of the
other Southern Regional. Last
Thursday, the NCAA awarded
UCLA, the Pacific 10 Southern
Division champion, the Western
Regional.
The Cardinal, one of the

country's 15 at-large selections,
has been assigned to the Midwes
tern Regional and will travel to
Stillwater, Okla., to play in a
double-elimination tournament
there.
The eight regional winners will
advance to the College World Se
ries in Omaha, Neb., on May 28-
June 2.
Stanford, the second seed in its
six-team tournament, takes on
fifth-seeded Appalachian State
Thursday. Oklahoma State, the
tournament favorite and the
country's fourth-ranked team,
plays Richmond (the regional's
No. 6 team); Arkansas (No. 3)
and Oregon State (No. 4) clash in
the other opening round game.
Three of the six teams going to
Stillwater played in the College
World Series a year ago, so the
Road to Omaha figures to be a
long and grueling one.
Until yesterday, local officials
had been optimistic about Stan
ford's chances of hosting a
regional. After all, the school
boasts a track record — Stanford
had hosted twice in the last three
years.
What was Marquess' pitch to
the committee members? "Great
record, great bid, great facility,"
said the Cardinal's coach. "We
thought it would be good
enough."
Well, it wasn't.
"Sure, I'm disappointed,"
Marquess said. "But 1 can see the
logic in it — there's just not much
we can do about it. Hey, we're
happy to be playing somewhere."
The NCAA's decision, Stanford
officials said, came down to raw
finances. Oklahoma State's bid
was simply more lucrative than
Stanford's. "Their bid was four
times what ours was," Marquess
said. "We thought ours would be
good enough — in fact, it was our
best bid ever."
"It was kind of a surprise,"
Ft#nk Carey, Stanford's starting
shortstop said. ' The coaches gave us the impression that
we would get to host. But, hey, either way we have to play
baseball."
From the sound of it, though, Stillwater doesn't boast
the sort of ballpark that caters to Stanford's brand of
baseball.
"1 don't like it at all," said Asst. Coach Tom Dunton,
the guru for Stanford's pitchers. "I understand it's a hit
ter's park . . . we'd prefer a big park, one where pitchers
can dominate."
Indeed, Pete Incaviglia — now the starting left fielder
with the Texas Rangers — hit an NCAA-record 48
round-trippers last year while calling Stillwater home.
"We have to pitch well and contain them," Marquess
said, "because we probably don't have the hitting to keep
up otherwise. It's a lot like playing in UCLA."
That's not a good sign for Stanford. The Cardinal
dropped two of its three road games with UCLA this year.
Another omen: Three years ago, when Stanford hosted,
the team advanced to Omaha. Last year, when the West
ern Regional was on the Farm, the Cardinal again
qualified for the CWS.
In 1984, however, when the Cardinal traveled to
Tempe, Ariz., Stanford's season ended two weeks early.
Arizona State bumped the Cardinal out of the competi
tion.

years.
What was Marquess' pitch to
the committee members? "Great
record, great bid, great facility,"
said the Cardinal's coach. "We
thought it would be good
enough."
Well, it wasn't.
"Sure, I'm disappointed,"
Marquess said. "But 1 can see the
logic in it — there's just not much
we can do about it. Hey, we're
happy to be playing somewhere."
The NCAA's decision, Stanford
officials said, came down to raw
finances. Oklahoma State's bid
was simply more lucrative than
Stanford's. "Their bid was four
times what ours was," Marquess
said. "We thought ours would be
good enough — in fact, it was our
best bid ever."
"It was kind of a surprise,"
Ft#nk Carey, Stanford's starting
shortstop said. ' The coaches gave us the impression that
we would get to host. But, hey, either way we have to play
baseball."
From the sound of it, though, Stillwater doesn't boast
the sort of ballpark that caters to Stanford's brand of
baseball.
"1 don't like it at all," said Asst. Coach Tom Dunton,
the guru for Stanford's pitchers. "I understand it's a hit
ter's park . . . we'd prefer a big park, one where pitchers
can dominate."
Indeed, Pete Incaviglia — now the starting left fielder
with the Texas Rangers — hit an NCAA-record 48
round-trippers last year while calling Stillwater home.
"We have to pitch well and contain them," Marquess
said, "because we probably don't have the hitting to keep
up otherwise. It's a lot like playing in UCLA."
That's not a good sign for Stanford. The Cardinal
dropped two of its three road games with UCLA this year.
Another omen: Three years ago, when Stanford hosted,
the team advanced to Omaha. Last year, when the West
ern Regional was on the Farm, the Cardinal again
qualified for the CWS.
In 1984, however, when the Cardinal traveled to
Tempe, Ariz., Stanford's season ended two weeks early.
Arizona State bumped the Cardinal out of the competi
tion.
There will be no more baseball
played at Sunken Diamond this
year.
After a seven-hour phone con
versation yesterday between the
NCAA's six regional representa
tives — among them Mark
Marquess, Stanford's coach — the
NCAA released a complete list of
the sites for this weekend's eight
postseason regionals. Stanford was
not on the list.

Regional sites and pairing*
Midwest at Oklahoma St.
Stanford — Appalachian St.
Arkansas — Oregon St.
Richmond — Oklahoma St.
Central at Texas
Pepperdlne — Pan American
Arizona — San Diego St,
East Carolina/Southern Illinois — Texas
South I at LSU
Oklahoma — Eastern Kentucky
Tulane — Louisiana Tech
Jackson St. — LSU
South II at Florida St.
South Florida — Texas A&M/Baylor
North Carolina St. — Florida St.
West at UCLA
Loyola-Marymount — UCSB
Hawaii — UCLA
Northwest at Maine
St. Johns — Rider
Rutgers — Maine
Mideast at Michigan
Oral Roberts — Central Michigan
Indiana St. — Michigan
Atlantic at Miami
Georgia Tech — Navy
Alabama — South Carolina
West Carolina — Miami

Oklahoma State will host the
Midwest Regional; Texas the
Central; Maine the Northwest;
Florida State one of the two
Southern affairs; Michigan the
Mideast; and Miami, the defend
ing national champion, the Atlan
tic.
Louisiana State was named last
Monday as the host of the
other Southern Regional. Last
Thursday, the NCAA awarded
UCLA, the Pacific 10 Southern
Division champion, the Western
Regional.
The Cardinal, one of the

country's 15 at-large selections,
has been assigned to the Midwes
tern Regional and will travel to
Stillwater, Okla., to play in a
double-elimination tournament
there.
The eight regional winners will
advance to the College World Se
ries in Omaha, Neb., on May 28-
June 2.
Stanford, the second seed in its
six-team tournament, takes on
fifth-seeded Appalachian State
Thursday. Oklahoma State, the
tournament favorite and the
country's fourth-ranked team,
plays Richmond (the regional's
No. 6 team); Arkansas (No. 3)
and Oregon State (No. 4) clash in
the other opening round game.
Three of the six teams going to
Stillwater played in the College
World Series a year ago, so the
Road to Omaha figures to be a
long and grueling one.
Until yesterday, local officials
had been optimistic about Stan
ford's chances of hosting a
regional. After all, the school
boasts a track record — Stanford
had hosted twice in the last three
years.
