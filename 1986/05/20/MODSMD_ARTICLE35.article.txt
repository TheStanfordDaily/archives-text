AUSTIN, Texas — For many of
the Stanford women's tennis
players, the team championship
celebration here last night ended
early as they had to rest up for
today's first-round matches of the
NCAA singles and doubles cham
pionships.
"1 don't think it will be too bad,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said of having to return to the

Penick-Allison Tennis Center im
mediately before the individual
tournament. "We have the morning
off, which should help us."
Juniors Patty Fendick and Leigh
Anne Eldredge and freshman
Marianne Werdel will begin their
quest for the singles title today with
noon matches. Should they win
their first matches, they will play at
2 p.m. in the second round.
Fendick, who advanced to the
semifinals last year, is the No. 6
seed in the tournament this year.

"The team thing means more than
anything else," she said yesterday.
"But I'm just as hungry for the in
dividuals. I'm peaking at the right
time."
Fendick draws Miami's Ros
Riach today. "The draw is very
tough, " Brennan said. "There's
really not any easy matches. The
first round is going to be tough."
If she can win her first three
matches, Fendick will likely face
top-seeded Caroline Kuhlman of
USC in the quarterfinals. Yester
day, she beat Kuhlman 7-5, 6-2 in
the team championships.
"My freshman year, I was so
burnt out by nationals," Fendick
said. "Last year, I was so bummed
by losing (the team competition).
This year, I think I have paced
myself."
Werdel, who came on strong this
season after a slow start, is seeded
No. 8 and will play Duke's Sue
Taylor in the first round.
"I think because of her name, she
(Werdel) gets the nod," Brennan
said of Werdel's draw. "Also, she
finished strong."
Eldredge has the toughest draw
of the three Stanford entries. She
will have to beat No. 5 seed Beverly
Bowes of Texas this afternoon to
advance to the second round.
"I think she can beat Bowes,"
Brennan said. "If she can, she's in
pretty good shape."
The Cardinal doubles team of
Cari Hagey and Stephanie Savides
also received a difficult draw. They
play the No. 2-seeded team of
Gretchen Rush and Ann Hulbert of
Trinity today at 4 p.m.
"We got kind of an unfortunate
draw," Hagey said.
"It would be an upset, but
they're capable of doing it," Bren
nan said.
"I think we can beat them,"
Savides said.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team of
Fendick and Eldredge is seeded
fourth and will meet a Brigham
Young team in the first round.
Brennan sees Fendick-Eldredge
as one of the tournament favorites.
"They've beaten Rush and Hul
bert," he said. "They haven't
beaten Kuhlman and (Dena) Levy,
but they certainly could."

Patty Fendick has been considered a top contender for the NCAA
singles title all season, but her victory yesterday over USC's previ
ously undefeated Caroline Kuhlman should make her the favorite in
the competition.
