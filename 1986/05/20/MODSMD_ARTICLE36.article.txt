# Gymnasts qualify in L.A.
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
Just when you thought you had seen the last of the
men's gymnastics articles for this year, here's another one.
As Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada put it, "Our season
never ends. After the NCAAs, we keep going right
through the year."
This time the topic is the U.S. Western Regional Cham
pionships, held last weekend at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
The Cardinal had four competitors entered, junior
Randy Besosa, sophomores Mike Matzek and Chuck
Gerardo, and freshman Andy Ropp. Last year, Besosa,
Matzek and Gerardo, along with senior Jon Louis,
qualified for the U.S. Championships, and this year the
results are the same.
Both Besosa and Matzek automatically made the na
tionals with combined scores of 108.65 and 108.15,
respectively. Gerardo, with a score of just above 105, ac
cording to Matzek (the Stanford contingent left Pauley
before the official results were released), is sure to be
among the top 72. Louis qualified at the beginning of the
NCAA season last winter.
Hamada and Matzek said Ropp also has a fairly good
chance of winning a trip to Indianapolis but said not to bet
the house ori it.
To make the national championships, one must either
score 108 or more points in any combination compulsory -
optionals meet, or finish among the top 72 of all
performers in the four regional championships. While
many gymnasts had already qualified prior to last
weekend's competition, most look to break into the elite
at their region's meet.
This meet was the last chance for U.S. gymnasts to
qualify for the National Championships, to be held June

19-22 in Indianapolis, Ind. The top 24 performers there
will make up the U.S. National Team.
The Cardinal approach to individual meets is much dif
ferent from its approach to team meets. Hamada lets his
gymnasts loose, allowing them the freedom and heavy re
sponsibility of training on their own. According to
Hamada, Ropp's status would not be so indefinite if his
preparation had been a little better.
"I told the guys they would be training individually,
that's where Andy's inexperience showed," he said. "I
hope he has realized that he's the one who has to train and
get ready, himself, for the individual meets."
Matzek, who scored just above 100 last year, was very
pleased with his performance. "I had a real good
weekend," he said. "I got things done I wanted to get
done. ... I showed myself and a few other people, like
Sadao, that I've really come a long way."
Besosa, already a national team member, finished
fourth out of the 46 gymnasts competing, one place ahead
of Matzek. A couple weeks ago, he was planning to forego
this meet for an international meet in Czechoslovakia. His
trip was cancelled, however, due to the nuclear reactor
meltdown in the Soviet Union. His next meet will be the
Emerald Games in Eugene, Ore., against some of the na
tion's best.
Meanwhile, Matzek, Gerardo and perhaps Ropp will
be looking towards the U.S. Championships, the biggest
meet of the year in the United States. It will also be the
toughest meet of the year. "There's a lot of real good
gymnasts at championships," Matzek said. "Everybody's
going to be a lot cleaner, a lot sharper."
Matzek doesn't think this will necessarily stop the Card
inal gymnasts, though. He said each ot his teammates, as
well as himself, has a chance of making the national team.
