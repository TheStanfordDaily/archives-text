Germans enter embassy in protest
BONN, West Germany — About 50 West German volunteer workers
have occupied their country's embassy in Nicaragua to protest the ab
duction of eight of their countrymen by U.S.-financed contra rebels, a
West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday.
The West Germans marched into the embassy building in Managua on
Sunday and remained overnight, rejecting pleas from embassy staff to
leave.
A spokesman for the group said they wanted to force the Bonn gov
ernment to negotiate for the release of the eight Germans, who were
seized Friday in village of jacinto Vaca, about 215 miles from Managua.
A Bonn government spokesman said yesterday that nothing had been
heard from the kidnappers, believed to be members of U.S.-backed
Democratic Force of Nicaragua, based in Honduras.
The West German government formed a crisis staff Sunday to help
seek the release of the West Germans, who were abudcted 10 days after
arriving in Nicaragua to work on an agricultural project.
Four other West Germans escaped capture when a gunfight broke out
between Nicaraguan army forces and the rebels. The remaining eight
Germans were taken towards the Honduran border.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has branded the kidnapping as
"an act of violence" that had no political justification.
Error may have caused accident
MOSCOW — The chief designer of the Chernobyl atomic plant said
yesterday that he believes human error and not a technical failure led to
the worst disaster in the history of the nuclear power industry.
Ivan Yemelyanov, a non-voting member of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, also said in an interview with Western reporters, that the Soviet
Union does not build containment domes around its reactors because
while they do not guarantee safety, they can lead to a false sense of se
curity.
Yemelyanov, 72, said a government commission investigating the
Chernobyl tragedy would provide the final verdict on the cause of the
accident. But he made it clear that he believed that someone at the nu
clear plant 60 miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine violated the safety rules
for the 1,000 megawatt boiling-water reactor, overriding the built-in
systems to avoid a nuclear accident.
Yemelyanov did not specify what the human error was but he insisted
that the plant had built-in systems to control the release of radiation if
procedures were followed properly.
A "crucial question," he said, was why one of the hundreds of pipes
cooling off the reactor suddenly burst at 1:23 a.m. last April 26, trigger
ing a chemical explosion that blew the roof off Chernobyl Reactor No. 4.
Recreating the scene at Chernobyl before the pipe burst, Yemelyanov
said the ill-fated Reactor No. 4 was operating at 6 percent of its 1,000-
megawat capacity during a pre-scheduled shutdown when the accident
occured.
Suddenly, in less than 10 seconds, he said, a power surge increased the
reactor's output to 50 percent of capacity, triggering emergency systems
that shut it down completely.
But he said he could not explain why there was a power surge, a ques
tion that he said would be answered by the special government commis
sion.
China, Taiwan agree on plane
HONG KONG — After three days of unprecedented direct negotia
tions with Taiwan, Chinese officials yesterday agreed to return a China
Air Lines Boeing 747 cargo jet and two crew members to Taiwan.
But the plane's pilot, 57-year-old veteran Taiwan Air Force flier
Wang Xi Jue, will remain in China following charges that he intention
ally diverted the plane May 3 to defect to China.
The agreement follows talks by officials of Taiwan's China Air Lines
and China's CAAC civil airlines. It was the first time that representa
tives of the two countries had met formally since Taiwan's separation
from the Communist mainland 37 years ago.
A CAAC spokesman told reporters in Hong Kong yesterday that the
aircraft and crew would probably be returned this week.
Peking initially treated the arrival of the cargo jumbo jet in Canton as
a propaganda coup in its drive to reunify Taiwan with China. Wang, a
decorated Taiwan pilot, even appeared before reporters in Peking to
denounce what he called political and social degeneration in Taiwan.
But at the negotiating table, Peking's representatives were unex
pectedly flexible and were credited with granting a solution that would
allow Taipei to save face.
Dominican vote results contested
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — A bitter dispute over
close returns from Dominican presidential elections yesterday stalled
vote counting for the second day, and political tensions rose in this
Caribbean country.
Radio and television stations, controlled by the Central Electoral
Board since Friday's vote, repeatedly broadcast an armed forces com
munique calling on citizens to await the final results "with serenity."
The latest official election returns, announced Sunday morning, gave
41.5 percent of the votes to former President Joaquin Balaguer and 39.7
pcrcent to former President Jacobo Majluta. That tally was based on
votes from 92 percent of the country's 6,024 polling places.
However, Majluta charged Sunday night that the returns were adul
terated by irregularities. He called for a full review of all poll reports and
demanded the removal of two members of the Electoral Board.
The two, including the board chairman, stepped aside to allow their
replacement by alternate members. But Balaguer's patty filed a formal
demand for the removal of one of the alternate members.
A blue-ribbon advisory commission, appointed last week to oversee
the elections, announced that it was withdrawing from the vote counting
center because the two alternate members of the Electoral Board were
opposing resumption of the vote count.
While both the armed forces and the election board had claimed that
the elections were free and fair, Majluta claimed that the election might
be fraudulent.
Rebels down Sudanese plane
NAIROBI. Kenya — Two Western relief organization workers were
among eight persons who died Sunday when rebels shot down a military
aircraft that was carrying them through southern Sudan, aid officials said
here yesterday.
A spokesman for the California-based World Vision Organization
identified one of the dead workers as Mark Fletcher, the South African
born coordinator for Sudan of the Band Aid organization founded by
Irish pop singer Bob Geldof.
The second victim was identified as World Vision worker Malou Ater,
the Anglican bishop of the southern Sudanese province of Bahr el-
Gelsal.
World Vision said that the aircraft was hit by a rocket while travelling
between Rumbeck and Wau in war-torn southern Sudan. The Sudanese
People's Liberation Army was suspected of having carried out the at
tack.
The official Sudanese news agency had earlier said that eight persons
died when rebels hit a military plane, but the agency identified the vic
tims only as a government official, a senior army officer and six soldiers.
Sudanese People's Liberation Army based in the south of the country,
oppose the mainly Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum.
