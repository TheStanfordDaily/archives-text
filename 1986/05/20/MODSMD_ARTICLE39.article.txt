# South Africa bombs three nations

### 
HARARE, Zimbabwe — South Africa, under
scoring its military superiority over its black-ruled
neighbors, yesterday staged commando raids in
Zimbabwe and Botswana and a combined ground
and air strike in Zambia on targets allegedly used
by the African National Congress, the main black
resistance movement.
Military officials in Pretoria said the raiders hit at
"operational centers" and "terrorist transit
facilities" in the three countries used by the ANC
as staging posts for insurgent attacks inside South
Africa. All of the raids, they said, had been
"successfully completed," reported Washington
Post special correspondent Allister Sparks from
Johannesburg.
Officials in Zambia said the attack there, a
combined air and ground operation that marked
South Africa's first raid near the capital of Lusaka,
had struck a United Nations refugee camp 10 miles
southwest of Lusaka that had no connection with
the ANC. In Botswana, the raiders hit a housing
complex just outside Gaborone, the capital, that
Botswana officials also claimed had no link to the
exiled guerrilla organization.
The raid at two sites in the Zimbabwean capital
here, an ANC office downtown and an apparently
deserted house in a middle-class northeastern sub
urb, marked the first time South Africa has openly
attacked this country, the region's most militarily
powerful and economically stable black-ruled na
tion.
The leaders of all three nations sharply criticized
the raids. Zimbabwean Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe termed the attacks "barbarous ... cowardly
and unprovoked." In London, the British Foreign
Office summoned the South African charge

d'affaires to give an "urgent explanation" of the
raids as Foreign Minister Geoffrey Howe
denounced what he called "a plain violation of the
sovereignty of three fellow Commonwealth
countries."
The Reagan Administration, joining the chorus of
criticism worldwide, expressed "outrage" yester
day at the South African attacks. Spokesmen said
the raids could be "a major setback" to efforts to
promote talks between South Africa's white and
black leaders.
Asst. Secretary of State Chester Crocker
summoned the minister of the South African Em
bassy, Andre Kilian, to the State Department yes
terday to lodge an official U.S. protest over the
raids. The Administration also lodged a protest
through the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria.
"We vigorously condemn these attacks by South
Africa," White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said. "The United States stands with the govern
ments and peoples of those countries (attacked) in
expressing our sense of outrage at these events and
our condolences to the families of the victims."
U.S. officials said no decision had been made on
further U.S. actions, but Speakes ruled out the pos
sibility of additional U.S. sanctions.
The attacks were viewed as a blow to U.S. policy
in Southern Africa, which has attempted to reduce
cross-border violence.
The military offensive was also seen as causing
perhaps fatal damage to a special Commonwealth
group's attempts at negotiating an end to violence
between ANC guerrillas and Pretoria.
The raids come at a time when violence contin
ues to escalate in the black townships in South

Africa and there are signs of an increasing right
wing backlash among the government's white
Afrikaner supporters. The attacks followed by two
days the discovery by South African police of a
large cache of dynamite, plastic explosives and
rocket-propelled grenades in a field in
Krugersdorp, a Johannesburg suburb.
ANC spokesman Tom Sebina, speaking by tele
phone from the organization's headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia, told reporters that no ANC mem
bers were killed or injured in the attacks.
Casualties in the three countries were reported
as light, with two deaths and about 15 injuries. But
the raids are certain to raise the level of tension in
the region, whose black leaders contend that
Pretoria is making them scapegoats for growing
black unrest inside South Africa.
Leaders of all three black-ruled nations contend
they do not allow the ANC to use their territory to
plan or conduct operations against South Africa.
But officials in Pretoria say the black states are ser
ving as conduits for arms and ANC operatives.
"It is obvious that Russian mines and weaponry
can be brought into South Africa by one route only,
namely our neighboring states," said Lt. Gen. A.J.
Liebenberg, chief of the South African Army, in a
statement yesterday.
Zimbabwe's Mugabe said South Africa had
"adopted state terrorism as a policy" and predicted
the result would be "a dangerous security situation
in the region because the victims will have to
defend ourselves."
Mugabe and Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda, who each held press conferences, called
for comprehensive and mandatory economic sanc
tions against Pretoria.

Officials in Zambia said the attack there, a
combined air and ground operation that marked
South Africa's first raid near the capital of Lusaka,
had struck a United Nations refugee camp 10 miles
southwest of Lusaka that had no connection with
the ANC. In Botswana, the raiders hit a housing
complex just outside Gaborone, the capital, that
Botswana officials also claimed had no link to the
exiled guerrilla organization.
The raid at two sites in the Zimbabwean capital
here, an ANC office downtown and an apparently
deserted house in a middle-class northeastern sub
urb, marked the first time South Africa has openly
attacked this country, the region's most militarily
powerful and economically stable black-ruled na
tion.
The leaders of all three nations sharply criticized
the raids. Zimbabwean Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe termed the attacks "barbarous ... cowardly
and unprovoked." In London, the British Foreign
Office summoned the South African charge

d'affaires to give an "urgent explanation" of the
raids as Foreign Minister Geoffrey Howe
denounced what he called "a plain violation of the
sovereignty of three fellow Commonwealth
countries."
The Reagan Administration, joining the chorus of
criticism worldwide, expressed "outrage" yester
day at the South African attacks. Spokesmen said
the raids could be "a major setback" to efforts to
promote talks between South Africa's white and
black leaders.
Asst. Secretary of State Chester Crocker
summoned the minister of the South African Em
bassy, Andre Kilian, to the State Department yes
terday to lodge an official U.S. protest over the
raids. The Administration also lodged a protest
through the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria.
"We vigorously condemn these attacks by South
Africa," White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said. "The United States stands with the govern
ments and peoples of those countries (attacked) in
expressing our sense of outrage at these events and
our condolences to the families of the victims."
U.S. officials said no decision had been made on
further U.S. actions, but Speakes ruled out the pos
sibility of additional U.S. sanctions.
The attacks were viewed as a blow to U.S. policy
in Southern Africa, which has attempted to reduce
cross-border violence.
The military offensive was also seen as causing
perhaps fatal damage to a special Commonwealth
group's attempts at negotiating an end to violence
between ANC guerrillas and Pretoria.
The raids come at a time when violence contin
ues to escalate in the black townships in South

Africa and there are signs of an increasing right
wing backlash among the government's white
Afrikaner supporters. The attacks followed by two
days the discovery by South African police of a
large cache of dynamite, plastic explosives and
rocket-propelled grenades in a field in
Krugersdorp, a Johannesburg suburb.
ANC spokesman Tom Sebina, speaking by tele
phone from the organization's headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia, told reporters that no ANC mem
bers were killed or injured in the attacks.
Casualties in the three countries were reported
as light, with two deaths and about 15 injuries. But
the raids are certain to raise the level of tension in
the region, whose black leaders contend that
Pretoria is making them scapegoats for growing
black unrest inside South Africa.
Leaders of all three black-ruled nations contend
they do not allow the ANC to use their territory to
plan or conduct operations against South Africa.
But officials in Pretoria say the black states are ser
ving as conduits for arms and ANC operatives.
"It is obvious that Russian mines and weaponry
can be brought into South Africa by one route only,
namely our neighboring states," said Lt. Gen. A.J.
Liebenberg, chief of the South African Army, in a
statement yesterday.
Zimbabwe's Mugabe said South Africa had
"adopted state terrorism as a policy" and predicted
the result would be "a dangerous security situation
in the region because the victims will have to
defend ourselves."
Mugabe and Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda, who each held press conferences, called
for comprehensive and mandatory economic sanc
tions against Pretoria.
