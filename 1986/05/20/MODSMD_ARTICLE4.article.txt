# Kennedy: change Western Culture
## Careful thought is needed, he says 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy last night responded to student
concerns that the Western Culture
program neglects non-European con
tributions hy asserting that the pro
gram should be revised.
In an interview on KXSU, Ken
nedy said, "I think it should be
changed and changed in significant
ways."
But he said he would not support
any specific revisions of Western Cul
ture until a "thorough examination of
the issue has been made" by the
Western Culture Committee of the
Faculty Senate.
"I'm not ready to recommend a
particular avenue — that is, whether
all tracks should have some introduc
tion of new material, whether one
track should be specialized, or
whether the whole concept should De
changed to one of world culture
rather than western culture," he said.
The Black Student Union charged
last month that "the current program
is a disservice to the Stanford com
munity because of its failure to ac
knowledge the contributions and im
pact of women and people of color on
American and European culture."
Kennedy called on the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (C-US) to
ask the Faculty Senate committee to
take action.
At its meeting tomorrow the C-US
will consider detailed proposals from
the HSU that call for the incremental
implementation of a world culture
program.
An open forum will he held tonight
at 7 p.m. in Kresgc Auditorium to
discuss the issue.
Kennedy said that "our concept of
what Western Culture is and what
ought to be in a course about it is con
tinuously being revised, and 1 think
that's healthy."
In the interview. Kennedy also said
he supports the establishment of a
Police Advisory Board, "but not un
der that name." Proposals that a Uni
versity committee be set up to review
police activity and lessen misun
derstanding between the students and
police were first made in the wake of
the alleged beating of senior Robbv

Perkins by Stanford officers.
Kennedy later told The Daily that
he would be willing to relinquish his
right to appoint the chairman of that
committee — allowing it to select its
own chair — in order to avoid possi
ble conflict of interest.
Although Stanford police are re
sponsible to the Santa Clara County
sheriff, they are paid by the Univer
sity.
Kennedy also said the shantytown
erected in front of his office to protest
South African apartheid will have to
come down soon. "It's quite obvious
we can't have it persist for much
longer." he said.
He added that he is "not sure it's
possible" to remove the shanties
without angering the students, but
said there is "considerable concern"
that the structures are fire hazards.
"We have tried to lean over back
wards on that as on other symbols of
expression of strong views around
here."
In a related area, Kennedy cau
tioned the students involved with the
Stanford sanctuary movement.
"It's important for those people
who are in the sanctuary movement
and are sympathetic to it make sure
that the people who are to benefit
from the movement are the
beneficiaries and aren't just being
used in an effort to embarrass the
University," he said.
Kennedy said sanctuary supporters
have "come close once or twice" to
doing this.
He added that "to the extent that
the declaration of a sanctuary simply
symbolizes the commitment of stu
dents to be active in this area, I think
it's fine and so does everyone else.
"To the extent that it commits the
officers of the University to permit
the use of University resources to
house refugees who are technically
being housed illegally, of course we
can't agree to that."
Kennedy was also asked questions
concerning the recent actions taken
against housed fraternities.
He said that the disbanding of
Delta Upsilon does not represent a
negative University attitude toward
the fraternity system. "That was the
result of what the DUs did, and noth
ing more should be read into it."
