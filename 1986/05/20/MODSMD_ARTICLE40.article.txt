# Court rules on affirmative action
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme
Court, in a significant victory for civil
rights groups, said yesterday that
broad affirmative action plans that
include hiring goals are constitution
ally permissible so long as they are
carefully tailored to remedy past dis
crimination.
The justices, acting in the first of
three major affirmative action or
"reverse discrimination" cases at the
court this term, appeared to signal
their rejection of the Reagan Admin
istration's position that such broad
plans are inherently unconstitutional
because they harm "innocent whites"
while benefiting minorities who were
not actual victims of discrimination.
At issue was a voluntary arrange
ment between a teachers union in
Jackson, Mich., and the local school
board to lay off white teachers before
laying off blacks with less seniority in
order to preserve minority hiring

gains. The court struck down the
affirmative-action arrangement.
The court said the Jackson plan did
not pass muster because officials
there failed to provide adequate
evidence of past discrimination in the
school system.
The ruling's importance, however,
stemmed from the language used by
individual justices in explaining their
positions. The court was splintered in
the case, as it has generally been in
affirmative-action controversies, with
no five-member majority joining any
single opinion.
But civil rights lawyers agreed with
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a
pivotal vote in the case, that the lan
guage of the opinions showed a
strong majority in favor of affirmative
action in general and in agreement on
"certain core principles."
She said the court clearly agreed
that public employers could have
affirmative-action plans to remedy

past discrimination so long as those
plans do not "unnecessarily trammel
the rights" of "innocent individuals."
In addition, O'Connor said a
majority also "forged a degree of un
animity" on the view that such such
plans "need not be limited to . . .
remedying . . . specific instances of
identified discrimination," as the Ad
ministration has contended.
Those words, if adhered to by a full
majority in the future, were seen as
extremely significant by court obser
vers. Broad hiring goals or quotas
tend to provide job opportunities for
whole classes of minorities, whether
individually victimized or not. A re
quirement that affirmative action
plans benefit only specific victims
would doom virtually every large
scale program of hiring goals. Until
yesterday, the views of a court
majority on this question were un
known.
Justice Lewis Powell Jr., writing for

a plurality in Wygant v. Jackson
Board of Education, said the Jackson
plan was invalid because Jackson offi
cials did not adequately justify it with
careful findings of past discrimination
and because layoffs were too drastic
to be used in affirmative action plans.
Such plans, he said, cannot be justi
fied by generalized claims of "societal
discrimination," because that is too
"amorphous a basis" for allowing
affirmative-action plans.
There must be "convincing
evidence" of discrimination by a gov
ernment unit before affirmative
action plans are appropriate, Powell
said, and the Jackson school board
did not provide it in this case.
But "other, less intrusive means of
accomplishing similar purposes —
such as the adoption of hiring goals —
are available," Powell said, implicitly
endorsing the use of such goals in
proper circumstances.
