Court limits rights
WASHINGTON — In a pair of decisions that
affect the privacy rights of everyone from
homeowners to Fortune 500 companies, the Su
preme Court said yesterday that police and other
government investigators may conduct aerial sur
veillance and take detailed photographs from the
air without obtaining a warrant.
In one case, the court upheld the Environmen
tal Protection Agency's power to fly over and
photograph a Dow Chemical Co. plant after the
company refused the agency's request for an on
site inspection. In the other, the court said that
Santa Clara, Calif., police did not violate the con
stitutional rights of a marijuana grower when,
unable to see into his fenced-in back yard, they
flew over it at a low level to gather information
for a search warrant.
The court, in two 5-to-4 opinions by Chief
Justice Warren Burger, said that such techniques
do not infringe on the Fourth Amendment's
protection against unreasonable searches, despite
the fact that government agents would have
needed a warrant in order to see the same thing
by entering the premises.
The majority emphasized in both cases that the
aerial surveillance gave the government an ad
vantage no greater than that of ordinary citizens
flying over the area.
Four dissenting justices, however, warned that
the court was letting the government eviscerate
constitutional protections against unreasonable

searches through the use of modern technology.
"Aerial surveillance is nearly as intrusive on
family privacy as physical trespass," Justice
Lewis Powell Jr. wrote in his dissent in the mari
juana case. "It would appear that, after today,
families can expect to be free of official surveil
lance only when they retreat behind the walls of
their homes."
CIA charges illegality
WASHINGTON — CIA Director William
Casey charged yesterday that an NBC report on
intelligence activities by accused spy Ronald Pel
ton violated federal laws prohibiting the dis
closure of classified information.
Casey, acting on the network's report that Pel
ton may have divulged to the Soviet Union infor
mation about electronic eavesdropping tech
niques by U.S. submarines, said he was referring
the NBC case to the Department of Justice for
possible prosecution.
The CIA director's charges were made as the
espionage trial for Pelton, a former National Se
curity Agency employee who is accused of selling
government secrets to the Soviets, began in U.S.
District Court in Baltimore.
NBC reported that Pelton apparently gave
away one of NSA's most sensitive secrets, a proj
ect code-named "Ivy Bells," which reportedly
was an eavesdropping operation conducted by
U.S. submarines in Soviet harbors.

"We believe that the assertions, if true, made
by James Polk on the NBC 'Today Show' this
morning violate the prohibitions . . . against
publishing any classified information concerning
the communications intelligence activities of the
United States," a statement issued by Casey said
yesterday.
"My statutory obligation to protect intelli
gence sources and methods requires me to refer
this matter to the Department of Justice," he
said. The Department of Justice had no com
ment.
Stocks do nothing
NEW YORK — The stock market showed
little change yesterday, drifting through its
quietest session in four months.
Energy stocks were one of the day's few strong
spots as the price of oil extended its recent rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down 29.63 points last week, slipped another
1.62 to 1,758.18. Some other, broader measures
of the market recorded small gains.
Analysts noted that several of the variables in
the combination of circumstances that worked so
well for the market earlier in the year have since
changed.
In particular, oil prices have rebounded signifi
cantly from their lows of around $10 a barrel.
The price of crude oil for June delivery jumped
$ 1 to $ 17.16 a barrel in yesterday's activity.
