Playboy sues Meese
LOS ANGELES — Playboy Enterprises Inc. is
suing U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese and
his Commission on Pornography, accusing them
of acting to censor and suppress distribution of
Playboy magazine through a blacklist.
The American Booksellers Association and
the Council on Periodical Distributors Associa
tions joined in the suit filed Friday in U.S. Dis
trict Court for the District of Columbia.
The lawsuit accuses the commission of sending
letters to bookstores and major drug and con
venience store chains in February, notifying them
they had been identified as vendors or dis
tributors of pornography.
Playboy claims the Dallas-based Southland
Corp., parent company of 7-Eleven stores, and

several other major chains decided to stop selling
Playboy after receiving the letter from Alan
Sears, executive director of the Commission on
Pornography.
"It's a form a sexual McCarthyism," Playboy
founder Hugh Hefner said yesterday in a tele
phone interview from his Holmby Hills mansion.
"We're talking about the suppression of images
and ideas with which some small portion of the
population disagrees. If we start doing that in our
society we're talking about something very, very
scary."
Meese, Sears and the 11-member commission
were named as defendants in the lawsuit. Also
named were Ralph Kennickell, Jr., public printer
of the United States and Donald Fossedal, super
intendent of documents of the United States.
Neither the attorney general nor the commis
sion had any comment on the lawsuit, said

spokesmen in Washington.
In a letter dated Feb. 11, Sears said the com
mission had received testimony in October 1985
indicating the recipients allegedly were involved
in the sale or distribution of pornography.
"The commission has determined that it would
be appropriate to allow your company an oppor
tunity to respond to the allegations prior to draft
ing its final report section on identified dis
tributors," the letter said.
The lawsuit alleges the letter threatened and
intimidated those who received it.
Today's weather
A chance of rain exists for the area today.
Highs will be in the upper 50s or low 60s. Partly
cloudy tomorrow, with highs in the 60s.
