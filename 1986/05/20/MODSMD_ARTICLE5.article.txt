# Tresidder study: what students want
## 
### TOM OSCHERWITZ 
A recent phone survey indicates that students
and faculty generally support Tresidder
Memorial Union's long-range development
plans.

Feature

Current plans call for the expansion of exist
ing services rather than the development of new
commercial enterprises. Tresidder plans to relo
cate The Store and the Corner Pocket and to
expand the Coffee House.
When asked if Tresidder lacks any primary

services, students and faculty did not express a
unified need. The largest request, a suggestion
to increase the number of banks, represented
only 3.9 percent ot the responses.
The respondents did suggest, however, that
existing services could expand into such areas as
dry cleaning and rentals for videocassettes and
ski equipment.
"The present survey fills in some of the grav
areas of the long-range plan." said Ted Hoof.
Tresidder marketing coordinator and director
of the survey.
Hoef said the most interesting result was the
large demand by students for a study area.
Sixty-one percent of the respondents consid

ered a lounge space essential to the new Tresid
der.
The survey suggests that students do not
believe the Coffee House should serve as a
study area. Only 7 percent of the respondents
said it is essential that the new coffee house be
conducive to studying.
The current Tresidder development plans
provide lounge space on the building's second
floor.
Suggestions for a new coffee house included
the expansion of the seating and dancing areas,
the improvement of food options and the devel
opment of more efficient peak-hour service.
Respondents further described their ideal cof

fee house as cozy and comfortable, well-lit and
less expensive.
Suggested changes at The Store include an
increase in shelf-space for food stuffs such as
packaged deli items, fresh-baked breads, dairy
products and fresh fruit. Some respondents also
wished that The Store would expand its services
to include a self-service copy center, VCR ren
tals and dry cleaning.
I he survey showed that students are inter
ested in renting skis, indicating that such a
service would be economically feasible.
Through the extrapolation of its sampling
results, the survey predicted that ski rentals
would approach 3,300 units annually.
