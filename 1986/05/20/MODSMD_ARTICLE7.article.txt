# Activists recall Malcolm X
## 
### JIM GUNTON Staff writer 
Assoc. Prof. Sonia Sanchez of Temple University was
the keynote speaker at yesterday's Black Student Union
rally in honor of Malcolm X, a controversial black activist
leader of the 1960s who was assasinated in 1965. A ra
cially mixed crowd of about 150 attended.
"We are here today to remember the man. Malcolm X,
and to remember his words." Sanchez said. "Malcolm X
made you say Tm black and I'm beautiful." "
Several others also spoke, including political activist
Gay Carson, a Stanford associate professor of history.
"What is it about Malcolm X — why should we honor
him?" Carson was asked.
"This question should never even be asked."' Carson
responded. "If Stanford had courses to teach us about
black history, this type of question would never be
asked."
"But we have to deal with the fact that this education
doesn't exist," he said.
Carson said that while Eldredge Geaver's assertion that
"black history began with Malcolm X" may have been too
strong, it would certainly be reasonable to claim that Mal
colm X "expressed old ideas with a new vigor (and)
brought these ideas to a new audience."
"Malcolm X demonstrated that it's possible for some
one with a vision of the future to bring himself up from the
past," Carson said.

While the "other" black civil rights leader of the time,
Martin Luther King, Jr., was a non-violent Christian. Mal
colm X was a Muslim in favor of "black liberation by any
means necessary," according to Carson.
Sanchez used her speaking opportunity to expand onto
a broader variety of topics.
" Racism. Imperialism. Apartheid. Segregation. Sexism.
(These) did not begin with capitalism, but all do indeed
seep from the pores of a capitalistic society . Their ten
tacles spout the blood of their victims. Their terrorist acts
have reduced Africans, African-Americans, Latinos.
Asians, name Americans."
Sanchez added. "The exploitation of a people because
of pigmentation was is the greatest diabolical attack on
the instinctual unity of mankind that has ever been per
petuated."
Sanchez' impassioned and moving speaking style got
the generalh placid White Plaza audience active for the
first time all day. In particular, her speech-ending emo
tional plea for "an ending to the children's cries." earned
her a standing ovation.
"We are here because of the children of Atlanta."
Sanchez said. "The children of El Salvador. The children
of Nicaragua. The children of South Africa. The children
of Ethiopia."
"We are here." she said, "for unit), and solidarity, for
peace. And we will be if we continue to work. Together.
Learning to live together again as human beings."
