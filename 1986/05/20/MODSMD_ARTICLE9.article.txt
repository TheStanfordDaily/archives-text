# Panthers to primaries, Cleaver does it all
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
Black America needs to reject the ideology that makes
it dependent on the federal government" for its basic
needs, a former Black Panther, now a candidate for the
Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, said last night.
Eldridge Cleaver, speaking before 80 people in Annen
berg Auditorium, said social welfare programs have
"harnessed blacks to the federal budget." Federal entitle
ment programs were created by the Democratic Party in
the 1960s as "payoffs" to black leaders for inducing black
support for democrats, he said.
"The black vote is not a thinking vote, it is a delivered
vote,' he said. He added that it is essential for blacks to
break their dependence on the federal government and to
develop programs that help blacks take advantage of the
economic system.
Cleaver's bid to win the Republican nomination has
received little attention to date; most polls do not even list
him as a candidate. In an interview with The Daily before
his speech, Cleaver accused Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los
Altos) and the other candidates in the race of trying to
sabotage his campaign.
According to Cleaver, the other candidates have
resorted to "dirty tricks" by manipulating the state Re
publican political machinery against him. In addition,
Cleaver said his opponents often invite him to candidate
forums and then change the format of the discussion, hin
dering his ability to participate effectively.
Cleaver said he had "state-wide appeal" and would win
the nomination based on his own track record. He added

that he would not use the media to recruit potential
voters."I don't buy my support," he said, referring to the
large amounts of campaign money spent by Zschau and
Ed Davis.
A self-proclaimed "red-baiter," Cleaver said
democracy is being "challenged by the international
(communist) apparatus that promises Utopia but delivers
slavery to the world." Cleaver said that through his many
travels in the communist world, he has come to recognize
the "dictatorship behind the proletariat."
According to Cleaver, politicians do not understand the
communist ideology that seeks to "take over the world."
Strong action against communism and other forms of
totalitarian government is needed, he said.
Calling the senate campaign a "race for blood," Cleaver
said he wanted to be elected to the senate in order to help
the United States "roll back the communist movement
and put those forms of government on the defensive."
Cleaver said the international banking situation pre
sented the greatest crisis to the world today. Like Latin
America, the rest of the world is falling "into hock" to the
international banking system.
Cleaver joined the Black Panthers in 1966, soon be
coming its minister of information. In April 1968, Cleaver
was involved in a shoot-out with Oakland police in which
Black Panther Bobby Hutton was killed. To avoid going
to prison, he fled the country. Cleaver returned to the
United States in 1975, after living in several countries.
Cleaver broke with the Black Panthers in 1974 becausc
of "left-leaning" in the black radical movement. Many
former radicals are now Republicans, according to
Cleaver.
