# Card completes sweep of NCAA tennis
## Men upend Pepperdine in finals, 5-2 Sports 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — After a sudden flurry of volleys on
the center court the yellow ball bounced off a Pepperdine
racket and hit the net. And as it quietly dropped on Pep
perdine's side, the six Cardinal players watching from the
sidelines fired their fists skyward in triumph.
Then they raced oncourt to pile on top of Patrick
McEnroe and John Letts, who had just won their No. 2
doubles match to clinch the team victory for Stanford.
Against all odds, the boys from Northern California had
just grabbed the 1986 NCAA Men's Tennis Champion
ships with a 5-2 victory over fifth-seeded Pepperdine.
Yesterday's Stanford triumph tied the sixth-seeded
Cardinal with the 1985 Georgia Bulldogs as the lowest
seeded team ever to win the championship. It also put a
yawn into the proceedings for the usually wild and vocal
Georgia fans — Stanford has now won the NCAAs six
times in the 10 years that the tournament has been held at
the University of Georgia.
But the Stanford players and coach felt that this crown
was different.
"It's unbelievable," McEnroe said. "We've been up
and down all year, but we rode it out."
"This year we had a lot of trials and tribulations," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said in the celebration circle. "But
these guys stayed with it and hung tough. That makes it a
special thrill."
The Stanford players had to hang tough all afternoon
yesterday, as the Waves were always one point away from
swamping the eventual champions. But the Cardinal won
all the key points, and that's what made the difference.
The noon matches started out even. On the first three
courts, Stanford had the edge, as seniors Dan Goldie and

Jim Grabb and sophomore McEnroe each took the first
set from Pepperdine's Kelly Jones, Robbie Weiss and
Marty Laurendeau, respectively.
On the last three courts, however, the Waves had the
edge. Pepperdine's Augustine Moreno and Craig Johnson
each won the first set from Eric Rosenfeld and Scott
Moody. In the No. 5 singles, Letts battled Wave Doug
Sachs into a first-set tiebreaker.
Moreno put Pepperdine on the board first, using his
Popeye-sized forearm to cut down Rosenfeld 6-1, 6-2.
After that, however, a red tide rolled in, as Stanford
rebounded with three consecutive victories.
Grabb methodically put away Weiss in the No. 2 singles
match. The Stanford senior had a big serve and smooth
passing shots and continually caught Weiss anticipating
too much en route to a 6-3, 6-4 win.
"I was nervous out there," Grabb said. "But I think he
was quite nervous, and he didn't get into the match until it
was too late."
McEnroe then followed his captain's lead. His first four
service games went to 3-3, but the New York native won
all four of those sudden-death points and broke Lauren
deau twice to win the first set 6-2. McEnroe then waited
until the 12th game of the second set to break the Wave
and win 7-5.
Stanford led 2-1 at that point, and the remaining three
singles matches all went three sets. Moody, who played
cliffhanger matches throughout the tournament, reeled
off eight straight games after losing the first set to Johnson
7-6 (7-4). The Stanford junior never did let up and sailed
to a 6-7, 6-0, 6-2 victory.
"The first set was real close — I was definitely in the
match," Moody said. "In the second set he got a little
