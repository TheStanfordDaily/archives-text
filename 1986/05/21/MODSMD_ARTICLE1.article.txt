# Card completes sweep of NCAA tennis
## Men upend Pepperdine in finals, 5-2 Sports 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — After a sudden flurry of volleys on
the center court the yellow ball bounced off a Pepperdine
racket and hit the net. And as it quietly dropped on Pep
perdine's side, the six Cardinal players watching from the
sidelines fired their fists skyward in triumph.
Then they raced oncourt to pile on top of Patrick
McEnroe and John Letts, who had just won their No. 2
doubles match to clinch the team victory for Stanford.
Against all odds, the boys from Northern California had
just grabbed the 1986 NCAA Men's Tennis Champion
ships with a 5-2 victory over fifth-seeded Pepperdine.
Yesterday's Stanford triumph tied the sixth-seeded
Cardinal with the 1985 Georgia Bulldogs as the lowest
seeded team ever to win the championship. It also put a
yawn into the proceedings for the usually wild and vocal
Georgia fans — Stanford has now won the NCAAs six
times in the 10 years that the tournament has been held at
the University of Georgia.
But the Stanford players and coach felt that this crown
was different.
"It's unbelievable," McEnroe said. "We've been up
and down all year, but we rode it out."
"This year we had a lot of trials and tribulations," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said in the celebration circle. "But
these guys stayed with it and hung tough. That makes it a
special thrill."
The Stanford players had to hang tough all afternoon
yesterday, as the Waves were always one point away from
swamping the eventual champions. But the Cardinal won
all the key points, and that's what made the difference.
The noon matches started out even. On the first three
courts, Stanford had the edge, as seniors Dan Goldie and

Jim Grabb and sophomore McEnroe each took the first
set from Pepperdine's Kelly Jones, Robbie Weiss and
Marty Laurendeau, respectively.
On the last three courts, however, the Waves had the
edge. Pepperdine's Augustine Moreno and Craig Johnson
each won the first set from Eric Rosenfeld and Scott
Moody. In the No. 5 singles, Letts battled Wave Doug
Sachs into a first-set tiebreaker.
Moreno put Pepperdine on the board first, using his
Popeye-sized forearm to cut down Rosenfeld 6-1, 6-2.
After that, however, a red tide rolled in, as Stanford
rebounded with three consecutive victories.
Grabb methodically put away Weiss in the No. 2 singles
match. The Stanford senior had a big serve and smooth
passing shots and continually caught Weiss anticipating
too much en route to a 6-3, 6-4 win.
"I was nervous out there," Grabb said. "But I think he
was quite nervous, and he didn't get into the match until it
was too late."
McEnroe then followed his captain's lead. His first four
service games went to 3-3, but the New York native won
all four of those sudden-death points and broke Lauren
deau twice to win the first set 6-2. McEnroe then waited
until the 12th game of the second set to break the Wave
and win 7-5.
Stanford led 2-1 at that point, and the remaining three
singles matches all went three sets. Moody, who played
cliffhanger matches throughout the tournament, reeled
off eight straight games after losing the first set to Johnson
7-6 (7-4). The Stanford junior never did let up and sailed
to a 6-7, 6-0, 6-2 victory.
"The first set was real close — I was definitely in the
match," Moody said. "In the second set he got a little

sloppy and 1 took it to him."
At No. 5 singles, Letts came within
two points of winning, but Sachs
prevailed in the second set and skated
through the third to win 6-7, 7-5, 6-2.
Now at the two-hour mark, Stan
ford led 3-2 and the only singles
match left was a psychological
struggle between two All-Americans,
Goldie and Jones.
Goldie took the first set 7-6 (7-2),
and Jones reached back to swipe the
second set 7-5. Goldie then broke
Jones' serve to go up 4-2, but the
Pepperdine star immediately broke
back to close it to 4-3.
"Dan was up a break in all three
sets and lost it (the break)," Gould
said later. "It takes an awful amount
of mental toughness to still come
back."
Goldie had more than enough
toughness. He broke Jones in the
next game and then held serve to win
the match 7-6, 5-7, 6-3. The win put

the Cardinal up 4-2 going into
doubles and seemed to snap Pep
perdine's morale.

"This year we had
a lot of trials and
tribulations. But
these guys stayed
with it and hung
tough. That makes
it a special thrill."

"Had Kelly won that match, it
would have been 3-3 going into
doubles, and it might have been dif

ferent," Pepperdine Coach Allen Fox
said afterwards. "We usually really
get going when he wins."
"The guys really get psyched when
I win," Jones agreed. "But I didn't
play too well, and he hit too many
good shots."
The first doubles match to get un
derway pitted McEnroe and Letts
against Gilberto Cicero and Weiss.
The Stanford pair outclassed their
opponents from the start of the match
to take a 6-2, 5-2 lead, and they
prepared to serve for all the marbles.
Meanwhile, in No. 1 doubles
Goldie and Grabb had taken a 5-3
lead on Jones and Moreno, and in the
No. 3 match, Rosenfeld and Moody
were up 5-2 in the second set after
losing the first to Laurendeau and
Johnson.
But all attention was focused on
court two. Letts served to a 2-0 lead,
but Cicero and Weiss ran off four
straight points to break and narrow

backhanded the ball into the net, and

of the collegiate tennis world.
After the match, Gould passed the
credit around to everyone but him
self.
"Johnny (Letts) lost every day in
singles, but came back and won in
doubles," Gould said. "It takes a tre
mendous amount of character to do
that.
"I guess Moots' (Moody) and
Dan's matches were the key. It's
really hard to outlast guys mentally.
They just toughed it out at the end,"
Gould said.
Of course, some credit has to go to
Gould. In the nine years that Stan
ford has been invited to the NCAAs
in Athens, Gould has piloted his
Cardinal teams to six championships.
As the post-match champagne .was
poured on players' heads, Moody
shouted, "Don't waste that!" And as
far as championship opportunities go,
that has been Stanford's motto.

The fists of Patrick McEnroe and his Stanford teammates all clenched
in triumph after he and John Letts sealed the 1986 NCAA Men's Tennis
Championship for the Cardinal with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Pepperdine's
Gilberto Cicero and Robbie Weiss.
ATHENS, Ga. — After a sudden flurry of volleys on
the center court the yellow ball bounced off a Pepperdine
racket and hit the net. And as it quietly dropped on Pep
perdine's side, the six Cardinal players watching from the
sidelines fired their fists skyward in triumph.
Then they raced oncourt to pile on top of Patrick
McEnroe and John Letts, who had just won their No. 2
doubles match to clinch the team victory for Stanford.
Against all odds, the boys from Northern California had
just grabbed the 1986 NCAA Men's Tennis Champion
ships with a 5-2 victory over fifth-seeded Pepperdine.
Yesterday's Stanford triumph tied the sixth-seeded
Cardinal with the 1985 Georgia Bulldogs as the lowest
seeded team ever to win the championship. It also put a
yawn into the proceedings for the usually wild and vocal
Georgia fans — Stanford has now won the NCAAs six
times in the 10 years that the tournament has been held at
the University of Georgia.
But the Stanford players and coach felt that this crown
was different.
"It's unbelievable," McEnroe said. "We've been up
and down all year, but we rode it out."
"This year we had a lot of trials and tribulations," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said in the celebration circle. "But
these guys stayed with it and hung tough. That makes it a
special thrill."
The Stanford players had to hang tough all afternoon
yesterday, as the Waves were always one point away from
swamping the eventual champions. But the Cardinal won
all the key points, and that's what made the difference.
The noon matches started out even. On the first three
courts, Stanford had the edge, as seniors Dan Goldie and

Jim Grabb and sophomore McEnroe each took the first
set from Pepperdine's Kelly Jones, Robbie Weiss and
Marty Laurendeau, respectively.
On the last three courts, however, the Waves had the
edge. Pepperdine's Augustine Moreno and Craig Johnson
each won the first set from Eric Rosenfeld and Scott
Moody. In the No. 5 singles, Letts battled Wave Doug
Sachs into a first-set tiebreaker.
Moreno put Pepperdine on the board first, using his
Popeye-sized forearm to cut down Rosenfeld 6-1, 6-2.
After that, however, a red tide rolled in, as Stanford
rebounded with three consecutive victories.
Grabb methodically put away Weiss in the No. 2 singles
match. The Stanford senior had a big serve and smooth
passing shots and continually caught Weiss anticipating
too much en route to a 6-3, 6-4 win.
"I was nervous out there," Grabb said. "But I think he
was quite nervous, and he didn't get into the match until it
was too late."
McEnroe then followed his captain's lead. His first four
service games went to 3-3, but the New York native won
all four of those sudden-death points and broke Lauren
deau twice to win the first set 6-2. McEnroe then waited
until the 12th game of the second set to break the Wave
and win 7-5.
Stanford led 2-1 at that point, and the remaining three
singles matches all went three sets. Moody, who played
cliffhanger matches throughout the tournament, reeled
off eight straight games after losing the first set to Johnson
7-6 (7-4). The Stanford junior never did let up and sailed
to a 6-7, 6-0, 6-2 victory.
"The first set was real close — I was definitely in the
match," Moody said. "In the second set he got a little

At No. 5 singles, Letts came within
two points of winning, but Sachs
prevailed in the second set and skated
through the third to win 6-7, 7-5, 6-2.
Now at the two-hour mark, Stan
ford led 3-2 and the only singles
match left was a psychological
struggle between two All-Americans,
Goldie and Jones.
Goldie took the first set 7-6 (7-2),
and Jones reached back to swipe the
second set 7-5. Goldie then broke
Jones' serve to go up 4-2, but the
Pepperdine star immediately broke
back to close it to 4-3.
"Dan was up a break in all three
sets and lost it (the break)," Gould
said later. "It takes an awful amount
of mental toughness to still come
back."
Goldie had more than enough
toughness. He broke Jones in the
next game and then held serve to win
the match 7-6, 5-7, 6-3. The win put

the Cardinal up 4-2 going into
doubles and seemed to snap Pep
perdine's morale.

The Stanford pair outclassed their
opponents from the start of the match
to take a 6-2, 5-2 lead, and they

Meanwhile, in No. 1 doubles
Goldie and Grabb had taken a 5-3
lead on Jones and Moreno, and in the
No. 3 match, Rosenfeld and Moody
were up 5-2 in the second set after
losing the first to Laurendeau and
Johnson.

Stanford senior Dan Goldie's last team match of his collegiate career was undoubtedly one of his best, as he
defeated Pepperdine's Kelly Jones in three sets. The victory at No. 1 singles gave the Cardinal a 4-2 lead in
the match and dampened the enthusiasm of the Waves entering the doubles.
the Stanford lead to 5-3 in the second
set.
"We were getting a little excited,"
McEnroe admitted. "But we weren't
worried because we had been
dominating and we knew it was going
to be ours sooner or later."
One game later, to be exact.
At match point, Letts ripped a ser
vice return and then a volley. Cicero

backhanded the ball into the net, and
as it fell, Stanford rose back to the top
of the collegiate tennis world.
After the match, Gould passed the
credit around to everyone but him
self.
"Johnny (Letts) lost every day in
singles, but came back and won in
doubles," Gould said. "It takes a tre
mendous amount of character to do
that.
"I guess Moots' (Moody) and
Dan's matches were the key. It's
really hard to outlast guys mentally.
They just toughed it out at the end,"
Gould said.
Of course, some credit has to go to
Gould. In the nine years that Stan
ford has been invited to the NCAAs
in Athens, Gould has piloted his
Cardinal teams to six championships.
As the post-match champagne .was
poured on players' heads, Moody
shouted, "Don't waste that!" And as
far as championship opportunities go,
that has been Stanford's motto.
