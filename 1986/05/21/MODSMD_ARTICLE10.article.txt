# Geiger concurs with Admissions' decisions

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Stanford's rejection of high school basketball
star Chris Munk was "the correct decision," and
should not have sparked the negative publicity
it did, Athletic Director Andy Geiger said at
last night's forum in Soto on the interplay be
tween admissions and athletics.
On March 21 Stanford denied admission to
Munk, considered by some the eighth-best high
school prospect in the nation this year. Munk, a
6-foot-9 power forward from Riordan High in
San Francisco, was also recruited by George
town, North Carolina and USC, among other
schools. USC was his final choice.
At the time, Munk told the Peninsula Times
Tribune: "It wasn't any fun waiting, but I'm
glad I didn't back out early. Stanford was my
first choice, and I thought I could get in. I think
I was a good role model, because I took it as a
personal challenge to get my grades up."
After working with the Stanford coaching
staff, Munk had raised his grade point average
to 2.8 by the time he was denied admission.
Geiger, calling Munk a "nice young man and
a perfectly capable person," said he was
"mortified" that the media leapt on the ath
lete's case to the extent that it did.
"We're Stanford people and it doesn't matter
that much that we're talking about him by name
in this room, but when it happens in the news
paper, and hundreds of thousands of people are
involved in the denial of a youngster at this level
.. . I thought that was horrendous, and I was
embarrassed by it," Geiger said.

The Munk case became the evening's exam
ple of the often delicate relationship between
the admissions and athletics departments.
Geiger and Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
spent the rest of the forum outlining the

specifics of that relationship.
"The great protection we have as athletic
people and the reason we have relatively few, if
any, scandals surrounding our program, is that
we have a checks and balances system that

really does work," Geiger said.
Fetter added that the decision to deny Munk
admission was not an easy one. "It's our job (as
admissions officers) to disappoint people," she
said. "You don't take this job to make people
happy.
"The problem is, when you have a case where
the decision involves a talented athlete, the
circle of disappointment expands beyond the
parents and relatives of the non-admitted stu
dent. In this case, that was seen with a ven
geance. I got letters from alumni I didn't even
know existed," Fetter said.
She said that every admissions decision is
based both on objective criteria — such as grade
point averages, test scores and extracurricular
involvement — and subjective criteria, which it
"would ill fit any dean of admissions to reveal
... in private or in public."
"All I can do is take the flak" that results
from such an "indefensible" position, Fetter
said.
Geiger said the Athletic Department has to vie
with other Pacific 10 Conference universities
that try to lure talented athletes away from
Stanford with "taunts and barbs." Among the
things other athletic departments tell recruits
are that Stanford is not a "fun" place for an ath
lete to be, or — less commonly — that they are
not smart enough to succeed here, Geiger said.
In such an atmosphere, the athletic and ad
missions offices try to maintain a "friendly" and
cooperative relationship, but sometimes (as in
the Munk case) the best that they can do is
"agree to disagree," Geiger said.
