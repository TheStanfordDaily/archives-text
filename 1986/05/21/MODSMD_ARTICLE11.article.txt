## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Grading plan misguided 
### 
Recent proposals requiring that students take
courses for a letter grade in order to fulfill University
distribution requirements (DRs) attack the symptoms
and not the root of the problems plaguing the DRs.
According to Carolyn Lougee, dean of Undergradu
ate Studies, students are currently avoiding higher
level courses and taking easier classes pass/no credit.
Lougee is a member of the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies (C-US) which came up the proposals.
Forcing students to take DR classes for a grade
would only exacerbate the problem — it would make
them even more reluctant to enroll in challenging
courses outside their area of expertise. Students would
search out the easiest courses possible. The policy will
further undermine the purpose of the DRs: to ensure
that each student acquires a significant familiarity with
various areas of knowledge.
For example, an English major is not going to take
Biology 40 for a grade when he knows he will face
keen competition for grades with pre-med students.

Instead, he will probably enroll in Physics for Poets.
The most fundamental problem facing the DRs is
the lack of student interest. If students feel DR classes
are a waste of their time, then no superficial reform
will salvage the program. DR classes must be tailored
more to student interests.
If the University is worried that students are not
taking challenging, upper- level classes, then it should
limit the number of classes which satisfy the distribu
tion requirements.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall, chairman of the C-US,
said last week that the problem seems most acute in
large lecture courses specifically designed by depart
ments to encourage enrollment by a wide variety of
students. If this is the case, then these classes should no
longer be counted as DR satisfiers.
Ideally, DRs could be very beneficial to students.
But forcing students to take DR classes for a grade
could only continue the erosion of this troubled pro
gram.
