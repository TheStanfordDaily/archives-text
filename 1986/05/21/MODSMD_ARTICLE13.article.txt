# Revamp ludicrous playoff system
## 
### 
Ice hockey is probably not California's most
popular sport. Most totally awesome dudes see surf
boards, windsurfers or water skis as God's sole rea
son for creating water. Ice hockey is popular in the
northern regions where the water turns too hard for
such toys.
The object of the game is fairly simple. Each
team has six players who wear skates and carry
sticks. While not throwing punches at each other,
the players try to hit a cylindrical rubber puck

through a goal, whereupon a light flashes and
people cheer. Sound like a ridiculous concept? It is
not nearly as ludicrous as the playoff system these
hockey teams use to determine which team is the
best.
The Stanley Cup is the most prestigious prize in
professional ice hockey, at least if you are Ameri
can or Canadian. I doubt that Pravda reports the
Stanley Cup winner as the world's finest. The Stan
ley Cup playoffs follow the regular 80-game season
of the National Hockey League (NHL). The top 16
teams advance to the playoffs. Since the NHL only
has 21 teams, one must immediately question what
the previous 80 games have accomplished.
The NHL is divided into two conferences: The
Prince of Wales Conference and the Clarence
Campbell Conference. Each conference has two
divisions which any math major will verify totals
four (Smythe, Norris, Adams and Patrick). The
names are a dead giveaway that the sport started in
Canada and the Yankee imperialists tagged on
later. Otherwise, we would probably have the
Washington, Lincoln, Nixon and Schlitz Divisions.
The Stanley Cup playoffs are a tournament for
mat. In Round One, the winner of each division
plays the fourth-place team and the second-place
team squares off against the third-place squad in a

best of five series. Round Two decides the division
champion in a seven-game series. The next round is
also a best of seven matchup and determines the
conference winner. Finally, after eight laborious
weeks of playoffs, the conference champions com
pete and decide the Stanley Cup winner. Currently,
Calgary and Montreal have made it to the finals
while most Americans have lost interest and
anxiously await the baseball all-star game.
This year's results demonstrate the futile and in
credible nature of these playoffs. First of all, no di
vision champion made it past the second round.
Chicago, Philadelphia and Quebec were all
defeated by fourth-place teams in the first round.
Edmonton, which was gunning for its third con
secutive Stanley Cup championship, was beaten in

the second round. The final four competitors were
all second and third-place teams. After having won
their division in a grueling season, it only seems fair
that a division champion receive a first-round bye
or at least some minor advantage. Currently, the
only incentive in regular-season play is not to finish
last.
Teams such as Hartford, Winnepeg and Van
couver made it to the playoffs after losing almost
twice as many games as they won and stood the
same chance of winning as the division champions.
They have no business being there and it would be
a tragic mockery of the system if any of these teams
were to win.
There are many ways the playoff system could be
improved but I will only suggest three. The most
sensible would be to adopt a procedure similar to

professional baseball, which after a 162-game
season has a playoff only among the four division
winners and culminates in the World Series. The
ordeal only requires two weeks and keeps losing
teams out of consideration. The NHL, which has
fewer teams and a comparable regular season,
should follow suit.
Since greed and gate receipts inevitably deter
mine the procedure, a realistic compromise would
be an eight-team tournament in which the division
champions and the next four teams with the best
records, regardless of their division, would enter
the playoffs. This would add an element of
suspense to the playoffs and still insure that only
winning teams were allowed.
A final last-ditch proposal would be a 12-team

format in which second and third-place teams
would vie for the right to challenge the division
winner. It would be similar to the wild-card concept
used in professional football. Admittedly, the
playoff season would drag on interminably so that
the owners could line their pockets, but the regular
season would at least have some relevance.
Any of these proposals are more logical than the
current Stanley Cup competition. Maybe if the
NHL cleans up their act, even Californians would
put away their skateboards and start to follow ice
hockey. Next we can work on the professional bas
ketball playoffs, which have all of the same prob
lems.

The object of the game is fairly simple. Each
team has six players who wear skates and carry
sticks. While not throwing punches at each other,
the players try to hit a cylindrical rubber puck

through a goal, whereupon a light flashes and
people cheer. Sound like a ridiculous concept? It is
not nearly as ludicrous as the playoff system these
hockey teams use to determine which team is the
best.
The Stanley Cup is the most prestigious prize in
professional ice hockey, at least if you are Ameri
can or Canadian. I doubt that Pravda reports the
Stanley Cup winner as the world's finest. The Stan
ley Cup playoffs follow the regular 80-game season
of the National Hockey League (NHL). The top 16
teams advance to the playoffs. Since the NHL only
has 21 teams, one must immediately question what
the previous 80 games have accomplished.
The NHL is divided into two conferences: The
Prince of Wales Conference and the Clarence
Campbell Conference. Each conference has two
divisions which any math major will verify totals
four (Smythe, Norris, Adams and Patrick). The
names are a dead giveaway that the sport started in
Canada and the Yankee imperialists tagged on
later. Otherwise, we would probably have the
Washington, Lincoln, Nixon and Schlitz Divisions.
The Stanley Cup playoffs are a tournament for
mat. In Round One, the winner of each division
plays the fourth-place team and the second-place
team squares off against the third-place squad in a

best of five series. Round Two decides the division
champion in a seven-game series. The next round is
also a best of seven matchup and determines the
conference winner. Finally, after eight laborious
weeks of playoffs, the conference champions com
pete and decide the Stanley Cup winner. Currently,
Calgary and Montreal have made it to the finals
while most Americans have lost interest and
anxiously await the baseball all-star game.
This year's results demonstrate the futile and in
credible nature of these playoffs. First of all, no di
vision champion made it past the second round.
Chicago, Philadelphia and Quebec were all
defeated by fourth-place teams in the first round.
Edmonton, which was gunning for its third con
secutive Stanley Cup championship, was beaten in

the second round. The final four competitors were
all second and third-place teams. After having won
their division in a grueling season, it only seems fair
that a division champion receive a first-round bye
or at least some minor advantage. Currently, the
only incentive in regular-season play is not to finish
last.
Teams such as Hartford, Winnepeg and Van
couver made it to the playoffs after losing almost
twice as many games as they won and stood the
same chance of winning as the division champions.
They have no business being there and it would be
a tragic mockery of the system if any of these teams
were to win.
There are many ways the playoff system could be
improved but I will only suggest three. The most
sensible would be to adopt a procedure similar to

professional baseball, which after a 162-game
season has a playoff only among the four division
winners and culminates in the World Series. The
ordeal only requires two weeks and keeps losing
teams out of consideration. The NHL, which has
fewer teams and a comparable regular season,
should follow suit.
Since greed and gate receipts inevitably deter
mine the procedure, a realistic compromise would
be an eight-team tournament in which the division
champions and the next four teams with the best
records, regardless of their division, would enter
the playoffs. This would add an element of
suspense to the playoffs and still insure that only
winning teams were allowed.
A final last-ditch proposal would be a 12-team

format in which second and third-place teams
would vie for the right to challenge the division
winner. It would be similar to the wild-card concept
used in professional football. Admittedly, the
playoff season would drag on interminably so that
the owners could line their pockets, but the regular
season would at least have some relevance.
Any of these proposals are more logical than the
current Stanley Cup competition. Maybe if the
NHL cleans up their act, even Californians would
put away their skateboards and start to follow ice
hockey. Next we can work on the professional bas
ketball playoffs, which have all of the same prob
lems.
