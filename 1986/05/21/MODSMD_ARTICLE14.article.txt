# Recent divestment only a token gesture
## 
### 
The decision by the Stanford Board of Trustees
to divest from Newmont Mining — a company in
which it held only $9,900 worth of stock — and to
keep $182 million worth of investments in 79 other
companies which do business in South Africa is a
pathetic attempt to show concern for the black
South Africans who suffer at the hands of a regime
buttressed by our investments.
This attempt to pacify the majority of the student
body, which has called for total divestment, is the
most token and impotent of gestures. Furthermore,
it is a serious affront to black South Africans who
have called repeatedly for divestment; it indicates
profound disrespect for the opinions of people who
are black and who are oppressed. The board has il
lustrated that the University's ties to the corporate
world take precedence over student opinion, black
South African opinion, morality and even human
life.

In refusing to totally divest, the board has left
unanswered a number of questions. First of all, do
University President Donald Kennedy and the
board oppose total divestment for moral or finan
cial reasons? Kennedy has said on the one hand
that his stance is based on purely moral and practi
cal grounds. On the other hand, he has admitted
that his position is taken in part out of concern for
the future of the University, which necessarily
implies financial considerations.
To take just one example, it seems difficult to
believe that the recent gifts of $70 million and $50
million by David Packard and William Hewlett did
not affect the board's decision not to divest from
Hewlett-Packard. Board members have even
stated that one of their reasons for not fully divest
ing is their fear that corporate donations would
drop as a result. Thus it remains unclear whether
Kennedy and the board resist total divestment for
moral reasons, practical reasons or some combina
tion of both.
Second, according to Stanford's selective divest
ment policy — or non-policy — the University

divests from a firm if that firm is commiting sub
stantial social injury. However, the board has never
formulated any clear definition of what constitutes
substantial social injury. Remarkably, Stanford
continues to invest in nine companies which have
not signed the Sullivan Principles and invests in
numerous companies which sell goods directly to
the South African military and police.
The only position the board has taken is its rejec
tion of the notion that companies cause substantial
social injury just by being in South Africa. The
trustees maintain this position despite the fact that
these companies provide funding for the apartheid
regime through taxes, supply the technology used
by the government to repress the majority, provide
strategic resources to the government and act to
legitimize the white minority regime.
Selective divestment seems even more reprehen
sible in light of the fact that at our present pace, we
will not be fully divested until well into the 21st
century. Clearly, a policy of evaluating each indi
vidual firm in which we invest would take far longer
than black South Africans are willing to wait.
Third, Kennedy said over a year ago that he, like
Bishop Tutu, would advocate total divestment in
two years if apartheid was not being dismantled.
Tutu has since revised his time frame, and is now
calling for punitive economic sanctions, including
divestment. Kennedy, however, has not indicated
whether he too has revised his original two-year
time frame. It is clear that the board must commit
itself as soon as possible to a time frame for total
divestment. If now is not the right time for doing
so, what will indicate that the right time has come?
If over 50,000 deaths of black South Africans per
year are not enough, will 100,000 deaths per year
be enough? Is the board willing to set a limit on
how far the oppression and subjugation of black
South Africans can go before they totally divest?
Finally. Kennedy has said that one of the main
reasons he opposes total divestment is that he does
not feel divestment by nonprofit institutions makes
disinvestment of American corporations from
South Africa any more likely. However, there is
evidence to the contrary. Several American com
panies. including AT&T and Apple, have left

South Africa as a result of the entire divestment
movement and the negative publicity it has given
companies doing business in South Africa.
In addition, Citicorp, Motorola and Polaroid,
among others, all left South Africa after numerous
nonprofit institutions divested or threatened to
divest. Surely, divestment or the threat of divest
ment by an institution as prestigious as Stanford,
especially when in conjunction with other univer
sities, would put powerful pressure on corporations
to leave South Africa.
Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Ken
nedy still maintains that corporations can be more
effective by staying in South Africa and working for
reform, rather than by discontinuing support of the
apartheid regime by leaving the country. It has
become clear that corporations are unable to make
fundamental changes in the apartheid system.
Increased corporate involvement in South Africa
overthe last 20 years has coexisted with the loss of
citizenship rights for black South Africans, the
forced removal of entire communities to the ban
tustans and the implementation of controls on the
ability of black South Africans to move freely
throughout the country. Black South Africans are
as politically and economically powerless now as
they were 20 years ago, despite whatever efforts
corporations have made at reform.
Many students are coming to the realization that
the primary problem is the lack of democracy
within the University. If students, workers and staff
had any real power, the University would not now
be profiting from the situation in South Africa. All
three of these groups have continually stated their
desire to participate significantly in the decision
making process regarding investments in South
Africa.
Furthermore, all agree that the current Univer
sity committee system is decidedly undemocratic
and does not grant any real power to students,
workers and staff. Thus students will continue to
demand not only total divestment, but also
democratization of the University, including an ac
countable board of trustees and board meetings
which are open to the community.

legitimize the white minority regime.
Selective divestment seems even more reprehen
sible in light of the fact that at our present pace, we
will not be fully divested until well into the 21st
century. Clearly, a policy of evaluating each indi
vidual firm in which we invest would take far longer
than black South Africans are willing to wait.
Third, Kennedy said over a year ago that he, like
Bishop Tutu, would advocate total divestment in
two years if apartheid was not being dismantled.
Tutu has since revised his time frame, and is now
calling for punitive economic sanctions, including
divestment. Kennedy, however, has not indicated
whether he too has revised his original two-year
time frame. It is clear that the board must commit
itself as soon as possible to a time frame for total
divestment. If now is not the right time for doing
so, what will indicate that the right time has come?
If over 50,000 deaths of black South Africans per
year are not enough, will 100,000 deaths per year
be enough? Is the board willing to set a limit on
how far the oppression and subjugation of black
South Africans can go before they totally divest?
Finally. Kennedy has said that one of the main
reasons he opposes total divestment is that he does
not feel divestment by nonprofit institutions makes
disinvestment of American corporations from
South Africa any more likely. However, there is
evidence to the contrary. Several American com
panies. including AT&T and Apple, have left

South Africa as a result of the entire divestment
movement and the negative publicity it has given
companies doing business in South Africa.
In addition, Citicorp, Motorola and Polaroid,
among others, all left South Africa after numerous
nonprofit institutions divested or threatened to
divest. Surely, divestment or the threat of divest
ment by an institution as prestigious as Stanford,
especially when in conjunction with other univer
sities, would put powerful pressure on corporations
to leave South Africa.
Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Ken
nedy still maintains that corporations can be more
effective by staying in South Africa and working for
reform, rather than by discontinuing support of the
apartheid regime by leaving the country. It has
become clear that corporations are unable to make
fundamental changes in the apartheid system.
Increased corporate involvement in South Africa
overthe last 20 years has coexisted with the loss of
citizenship rights for black South Africans, the
forced removal of entire communities to the ban
tustans and the implementation of controls on the
ability of black South Africans to move freely
throughout the country. Black South Africans are
as politically and economically powerless now as
they were 20 years ago, despite whatever efforts
corporations have made at reform.
Many students are coming to the realization that
the primary problem is the lack of democracy
within the University. If students, workers and staff
had any real power, the University would not now
be profiting from the situation in South Africa. All
three of these groups have continually stated their
desire to participate significantly in the decision
making process regarding investments in South
Africa.
Furthermore, all agree that the current Univer
sity committee system is decidedly undemocratic
and does not grant any real power to students,
workers and staff. Thus students will continue to
demand not only total divestment, but also
democratization of the University, including an ac
countable board of trustees and board meetings
which are open to the community.

The decision by the Stanford Board of Trustees
to divest from Newmont Mining — a company in
which it held only $9,900 worth of stock — and to
keep $182 million worth of investments in 79 other
companies which do business in South Africa is a
pathetic attempt to show concern for the black
South Africans who suffer at the hands of a regime
buttressed by our investments.
This attempt to pacify the majority of the student
body, which has called for total divestment, is the
most token and impotent of gestures. Furthermore,
it is a serious affront to black South Africans who
have called repeatedly for divestment; it indicates
profound disrespect for the opinions of people who
are black and who are oppressed. The board has il
lustrated that the University's ties to the corporate
world take precedence over student opinion, black
South African opinion, morality and even human
life.

In refusing to totally divest, the board has left
unanswered a number of questions. First of all, do
University President Donald Kennedy and the
board oppose total divestment for moral or finan
cial reasons? Kennedy has said on the one hand
that his stance is based on purely moral and practi
cal grounds. On the other hand, he has admitted
that his position is taken in part out of concern for
the future of the University, which necessarily
implies financial considerations.
To take just one example, it seems difficult to
believe that the recent gifts of $70 million and $50
million by David Packard and William Hewlett did
not affect the board's decision not to divest from
Hewlett-Packard. Board members have even
stated that one of their reasons for not fully divest
ing is their fear that corporate donations would
drop as a result. Thus it remains unclear whether
Kennedy and the board resist total divestment for
moral reasons, practical reasons or some combina
tion of both.
Second, according to Stanford's selective divest
ment policy — or non-policy — the University

divests from a firm if that firm is commiting sub
stantial social injury. However, the board has never
formulated any clear definition of what constitutes
substantial social injury. Remarkably, Stanford
continues to invest in nine companies which have
not signed the Sullivan Principles and invests in
numerous companies which sell goods directly to
the South African military and police.
The only position the board has taken is its rejec
tion of the notion that companies cause substantial
social injury just by being in South Africa. The
trustees maintain this position despite the fact that
these companies provide funding for the apartheid
regime through taxes, supply the technology used
by the government to repress the majority, provide
strategic resources to the government and act to
legitimize the white minority regime.
