Davies distorted
historical reality
Most Polish citizens did nothing to
oppose the systematic slaughter of
Poland's Jewish population by the
Nazis. Indeed, many Poles applauded
the disappearance of the Jews from
their cities and villages and some
actively engaged in the destruction.
Hitler chose to place Auschwitz and
other major extermination camps in
Poland in part because of the virulent
anti-Semitism that prevailed there.
Widespread Polish anti-Semitism
during those years is a historical
fact, not a political question. Decent
historical scholarship demands that
events of the Holocaust that were
carried out in Poland be faithfully
portrayed.
Visiting History Prof. Norman
Davies' charge that the decision to
deny him tenure was motivated by
political considerations reverses re
sponsibility for his own partisanship.
History Department faculty were dis
turbed by, among other important
factors, Davies' lack of scholarly
detachment. For example, critics con
sidered emblematic his treatment of
Polish-Jewish relations as "not
merely insensitve but unacceptably
defensive of the behavior of Poles."
The faculty who denied Davies ten
ure argued that his historical analysis,
not his political position, was funda
mentally flawed. Davies responded
that he was denied tenure because
faculty members "disliked my view
point on controversial issues."
Davies apparently believes that
Polish history is answered on the
basis of the historian's political per
suasion, rather than the traditional
scholarly approach: historical ques
tions are to be addressed with histori
cal fact.
As an apologist for the relation
ships of Poles to the extermination of
European Jewry, Davies produced
defective historical scholarship. He
distorts what took place in Poland, as
well as what took place at the meeting
which led to the denial of his tenure.

Lawsuit threatens:
academic freedom:
In writing that the University em-,
barrassed itself by bringing Visiting
History Prof. Norman Davies
"halfway around the world" antf
denying him the rights other profes
sors enjoy, The Daily (May 15) too
quickly accepted Davies' own rheto
ric. Many professors would love to
teach at Stanford and would do al
most anything to get a job here. To!
say that Stanford brought Davies
halfway around the world from Eng*
land is to suggest incorrectly that the
University somehow dragged him
here against his will and therefore
owes him a tenured teaching post.
Unfortunately for Davies, visiting
professors have no entitlement to
permanent job offers.
Suits such as Davies' tend to chill
academic freedom by intimidating
university faculties. Fortunately,
American courts are loath to inter*
fere with university tenure decisions
and generally dismiss these suits
quickly.

Delay inexcusable
Last Thursday night at 2:15 a.m.
we were all jolted out of our beds by
our fire alarm. We rushed out of the
house, as most of us remembered the
Storey House disaster. It was cold
outside, but we waited.
Thirty minutes later the fire trucks
came screaming around the corner.
Luckily the whole incident had been a
false alarm.
We at 558 Mayfield would like to
know why it took the fire department
30 minutes to respond to our emer
gency?
We were appalled by the incredible
delay in the fire department's
response to our fire alarm. We hope
that something happens within the
department to make sure that this
slowness does not become a preced
ent.
