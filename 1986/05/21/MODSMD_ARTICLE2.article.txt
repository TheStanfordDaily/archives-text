# ASSU changes financial procedures
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
In the face of today's ASSU special elec
tion, the senate last night passed legislation
changing the ASSLTs financial policy and
received a report on possible imnacts of
the proposed initative on the current Stu
dent Organizations Fund (SOF) policy.
The special election, to be held today
and tomorrow, will determine the ASSU's
policy concerning the amount of interest
that should be paid to the student groups
that are forced by University policy to
bank in thj SOF.
AccoÂ» ing to graduate senator Richard
Biege 1 ho authored the initiative and
callpu the special election, the SOF policy
has been an issue for two years. He said
failed efforts to pass legislation within the
senate led him to call the election. The ini
tiative would force the ASSU to pay stu
dent groups interest rates that are compet
itive with rates that could be gained at
local banking institutions.
The ASSU last night also passed a bill
that intends to set standards for interest
rates awarded to student groups. Graduate
senator Jim DeLaHunt said he introduced
the bill in order to fulfil a promise he had
made at the last senate meeting to outline

a policy that will take into account the
changes in interest rates the ASSU will ex
perience when it divests student funds
from companies doing business in South
Africa.
The ASSU must pay no less than a base
rate of interest of 4 percent on the groups'
money, and "shall not, in any case, pay an
interest rate on any account which is
greater than the return that the SOF
receives on the deposited money."
The interest rates that will be awarded
according to this new policy are based on
"the difference between the base interest
rate and the rate that the SOF ordinarily
receives. . . .This difference is referred to
as the spread." Three kinds of savings ac
counts will be offered, with interest rates
determined by the size of the account.
Ordinary savings accounts, with no min
imum balance, will receive the base rate
plus one-quarter of the spread. Accounts
with a minimum balance of $1,000 will
have an interest rate of the base rate plus
one-half the spread and those with a mini
mum balance of $10,000 will receive the
base rate plus three-quarters of the spread.
In addition, the new policy will provide
time deposits similar to certificates of
deposit. These long-term, variable rate
time deposits will require a minimum

deposit of $2,500 and a minimum term of
one year. The interest rate on these times
deposits will equal the "rate that the SOF
ordinarily receives. . . . less the greater of
one-half of 1 percent or $25."
Criticizing the bill, Biegel said that since
student groups can receive a larger return
on investments4rt companies operating in
South Africa and therefore maintain a
higher minimum balance, "This policy
does a lot for student groups that don't
join the ASSU in divestment." The new
policy "does comparatively little to benefit
groups that join the ASSU in divestment."
"The senate is in effect bribing student
organizations to leave their money in
South Africa-related funds, where the
ASSU makes a bigger profit, too," he said.
A report issued by Hearings Offi
cer/Parliamentarian Jim McGrath offered
the senate "a preliminary interpretation"
of what changes the referendum will re
quire if it is approved. McGrath asserted
that requiring the ASSU to offer
"competitive" interest rates would "not
require that the ASSU offer the highest
possible rate."
McGrath added that while the rates
would have to be "competitive with rates
offered on similar accounts available at
nearby banks," no South Africa-free ac-

counts exist at local banks. With no local
comparison available, the ASSU would
then be in a position "to set any rate it
thought general public policy required."
In similar business, the senate changed
the wording on the measure providing that
the ASSU divest from University funds in
vesting in companies that do business in
South Africa.
While the measure reads that the ASSU
will transfer money to "the Working As
sets money-market fund," Financial
Manager Duncan Weaver argued that the
ASSU can get higher interest rate returns
by investing in other'funds that invest al
most solely in Treasury bills.
To give the ASSU more flexibility in its
investment options, the measure will now
allow the financial manager and senate
budget and finance committee to choose
which fund will provide the best invest
ment.
In other business, the senate passed a
resolution condemning Residential Educa
tion's proposal to impose a "drug pledge"
on the Alpha Delt fraternity. The resolu
tion referred to the pledge that requires
members of the fraternity to promise not
to use drugs and to turn in any house mem
bers) whom they see using drugs.
