## Cult exorcises religiously 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
"So far while living at Stanford I've
had the feeling that Memorial Church
had a monopoly on religion. We want
to offer an alternative."
So says senior Steve Cohen, the co
founder of a new campus religious or-

ganization that is
open to all members
of the community —
including followers of
other faiths.
The new group is
tentatively named
"The Church of the
Fresh and Innovative
and Omni-Moderate
God."
At the group's first
publicized meeting,
held near the Boat
house Monday even
ing and attended by
six onlookers and four
members, Cohen
listed several prin
ciples underlying the
new religion.
"We offer group
discounts. We organ
ize field trips to psy
chic fairs. We offer

membership to all persons, plants and
minerals."
He said he was not discouraged by
the small turnout, claiming that
"unaccountable" numbers of people
were "here in spirit."
Specific aspects of The Church
have not yet been determined, but at
least one member sees the exorcism
of evil spirits as a key component.
Co-organizer Joel Lerman, also a
senior, added that "caring and
sharing" would be very important to
the group, denying rumors that the
religion advocated ritualistic murder
or other violent acts.

Although Lerman and Cohen
spoke enthusiastically about the pur
pose of their newly founded religion,
during the meeting — advertised in
The Daily and fliers circulated on
campus — they did not directly
outline its nature or underlying
beliefs.
Instead, Cohen expressed vague

hopes that future meetings would
facilitate the revelation of "spiritual
secrets."
"One secret has been revealed to
us already, and that is that we are all
spiritual healers," Cohen claimed. He
refused to identify the source of the
revelation.
Students who attended the meeting
had mixed feelings about the The
Church of the Fresh and Innovative
and Omni-Moderate God.
"I really don't have anything to
say," said one student who wished
not to be identified.
Graduate student Chris Zuleeg,

while claiming he was "just here to
watch the sunset," nevertheless ac
knowledged that the religion could
prove beneficial to some people —
"but you can't take it seriously."
Lerman agreed with this observa
tion.
"Humor is part of the religion," he
said.

Senior Steve Hof
fman had only praise
for the group's efforts,
specifically the
meeting in progress.
"I've been to many
gatherings, but all the
others had such bad
energy," said Hof
fman. "And this is
such an idyllic spot."
Before the group
disbanded for the
evening, Cohen enter
tained onlookers by
exorcising demons
from a student, telling
him only to relax and
"hang your head
down." Cohen made
several quick gestures
with his hands and
fingers and the ritual
was completed in two
minutes.

" Do you feel more relaxed now?"
Cohen asked the student. "Do you
feel a tingling sensation?"
"I'm not sure," the student replied.
Afterwards Cohen warned against
a literal interpretation of his remarks
during the meeting, which upon occa
sion were rendered into song by a
group member who had brought a
guitar to the lake.
"What I'm thinking at this moment
might not have any significance at
all," he said.
The group's second meeting will be
held at the same time and location
next week, members said.
