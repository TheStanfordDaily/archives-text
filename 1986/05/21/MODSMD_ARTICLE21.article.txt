## Don't panic: researchers working to control attacks 
### VIVIAN LIU 
One moment you're feeling fine,
and the next your heart is beating so
fast it feels as if it's about to burst.
There is no apparent reason for the
onset of these palpitations, and you
are unable to stop them. You're
distressed and anxious that you can't
control a situation which passes as
mysteriously as it began.
If you've had such an experience,
you are not alone, according to Dr. C.
Barr Taylor, an associate professor of
psychiatry here. Taylor was the prin
cipal investigator in a study verifying
the reality of panic attacks. Five to six
percent of the U.S. population suffers
from these attacks of panic or anx
iety, he said, which manifest them
selves in one or more of the following
symptoms: heart palpitations, short
ness of breath, faintness and dizzi
ness.
Only recently has it been possible
to actually measure and affirm the
reality of these attacks, thanks to
Taylor's study with other researchers
at the Department of Psychology of
the Stanford Medical School. "In
fact," Taylor said, "no one has ever
known whether or not you could
measure panic attacks. The patients
are often told by their physicians that
they're making it up, that it's all in
their heads."
In the study, patients were
equipped with small Vitalog MC-2
computers on their belts for six days.
During this time, the computers
stored data on heartbeat levels, as
well as the body's level of physical ac

tivity. Patients were asked to record
all occurrences of panic and anxiety
attacks over the six days.
Afterward, three independent ob
servers analyzed the computer data,
looking for a heart rate increase of at
least 30 beats-per-minute from sur
rounding 15-minute periods, an in
creased heart rate during a three
minute period, and an increased heart
rate accompanied by little or no
physical activity. When all three ob
servers recognized a heart rate
change, and when the time of the
change was verified by the patient's
diary entry, the episode was consid
ered a real panic attack.
The study was conducted with a
small and large group. The smaller
group included 24 female patients, 12
of them with a history of panic attacks
and 12 of them acting as a control
group, having no history of attacks.
The patients reported 33 panic at
tacks, and the computer data verified
that in 19 of them the heart rates
were "disproportionate to the physi
cal activity," Taylor said. The larger
group, involving 50 male and female
patients, showed similar results.
Fifty-eight percent of their reported
panic attacks were verified by com
puter data.
Three important findings of the
study were the assurance of the
reality of panic attacks, the increased
awareness of nighttime panic attacks,
and the knowledge that victims of at
tacks are not in real physical danger.
Although they are often terrified and
have a sense that they are going to
die, "they're physiologically not in

any danger. The heart rate rarely
goes to a level that is worrisome from
a medical standpoint," Taylor said.
One of the more significant fin
dings of the study was that the
nighttime panic attacks commonly
occurred from 1:30 a.m. to 3:30 a.m.,
at times when hormonal shifts nor
mally occur in the body. The Stanford
researchers are now investigating this
connection. Victims awaken at these
morning hours at the onset of an at
tack. The spontaneity of the attacks

suggests that individuals can't control
them, lending a real fear to people
who feel powerless to change the sit
uation.
Dr. Bruce Arnow, clinical psychol
ogist and director of behavioral psy
chology at the Stanford Medical
School's Department of Psychology,
suggests that it is the individual's con
templation of future attacks that
compounds the individual's fears and
brings about another attack.
Attacks can occur often or rarely,
and they seem to be perpetuated
overdue worry about another attack.
Attacks probably begin as a psycho
logical phenomenon which eventually
lead to physical symptoms, Arnow

said. This pattern is likely to repeat in
the cases of chronic panic attacks. Of
ten, persisting attacks lead to the vic
tim developing a fear of places from
which he cannot easily escape, such as
bridges and shopping centers, and to
avoidance of these places.
"Modern day treatments include
both regularly taken medication and
cognitive therapy," Arnow said.
Cognitive therapy involves exposure
to situations that the panic victim
avoids. Changing one's thinking pat
tern and building one's strength to
overcome fears helps to break the
cycle that spurs panic attacks.
Another therapy that has
developed is breathing techniques for
an individual who senses the begin
ning of an attack. The patient is
taught deep breathing, which helps
him calm down until the attack
subsides. There is hope for tremen
dous progress in this area of treat
ment within the next three to five
years, according to Arnow.
"The longterm purpose of all this is
really to develop better and safer
treatments," Taylor explained.
"That's one of the reasons why we're
so interested in the heart rate data â€”
because the drugs we use do have
some effect on the heart rate."
The Stanford research team is
seeking volunteers for further study.
Individuals with a history of panic or
anxiety attacks can phone 723-7240

pants undergo thorough physical ex
aminations and diagnostic interviews
and must meet specific medical
criteria.

suggests that individuals can't control
them, lending a real fear to people
who feel powerless to change the sit
uation.
Dr. Bruce Arnow, clinical psychol
ogist and director of behavioral psy
chology at the Stanford Medical
School's Department of Psychology,
suggests that it is the individual's con
templation of future attacks that
compounds the individual's fears and
brings about another attack.
Attacks can occur often or rarely,
and they seem to be perpetuated
overdue worry about another attack.
Attacks probably begin as a psycho
logical phenomenon which eventually
lead to physical symptoms, Arnow

said. This pattern is likely to repeat in
the cases of chronic panic attacks. Of
ten, persisting attacks lead to the vic
tim developing a fear of places from
which he cannot easily escape, such as
bridges and shopping centers, and to
avoidance of these places.
"Modern day treatments include
both regularly taken medication and
cognitive therapy," Arnow said.
Cognitive therapy involves exposure
to situations that the panic victim
avoids. Changing one's thinking pat
tern and building one's strength to
overcome fears helps to break the
cycle that spurs panic attacks.
Another therapy that has
developed is breathing techniques for
an individual who senses the begin
ning of an attack. The patient is
taught deep breathing, which helps
him calm down until the attack
subsides. There is hope for tremen
dous progress in this area of treat
ment within the next three to five
years, according to Arnow.
"The longterm purpose of all this is
really to develop better and safer
treatments," Taylor explained.
"That's one of the reasons why we're
so interested in the heart rate data â€”
because the drugs we use do have
some effect on the heart rate."
The Stanford research team is
seeking volunteers for further study.

One moment you're feeling fine,
and the next your heart is beating so
fast it feels as if it's about to burst.
There is no apparent reason for the
onset of these palpitations, and you
are unable to stop them. You're
distressed and anxious that you can't
control a situation which passes as
mysteriously as it began.
If you've had such an experience,
you are not alone, according to Dr. C.
Barr Taylor, an associate professor of
psychiatry here. Taylor was the prin
cipal investigator in a study verifying
the reality of panic attacks. Five to six
percent of the U.S. population suffers
from these attacks of panic or anx
iety, he said, which manifest them
selves in one or more of the following
symptoms: heart palpitations, short
ness of breath, faintness and dizzi
ness.
Only recently has it been possible
to actually measure and affirm the
reality of these attacks, thanks to
Taylor's study with other researchers
at the Department of Psychology of
the Stanford Medical School. "In
fact," Taylor said, "no one has ever
known whether or not you could
measure panic attacks. The patients
are often told by their physicians that
they're making it up, that it's all in
their heads."
In the study, patients were
equipped with small Vitalog MC-2
computers on their belts for six days.
During this time, the computers
stored data on heartbeat levels, as
well as the body's level of physical ac

tivity. Patients were asked to record
all occurrences of panic and anxiety
attacks over the six days.
Afterward, three independent ob
servers analyzed the computer data,
looking for a heart rate increase of at
least 30 beats-per-minute from sur
rounding 15-minute periods, an in
creased heart rate during a three
minute period, and an increased heart
rate accompanied by little or no
physical activity. When all three ob
servers recognized a heart rate
change, and when the time of the
change was verified by the patient's
diary entry, the episode was consid
ered a real panic attack.
The study was conducted with a
small and large group. The smaller
group included 24 female patients, 12
of them with a history of panic attacks
and 12 of them acting as a control
group, having no history of attacks.
The patients reported 33 panic at
tacks, and the computer data verified
that in 19 of them the heart rates
were "disproportionate to the physi
cal activity," Taylor said. The larger
group, involving 50 male and female
patients, showed similar results.
Fifty-eight percent of their reported
panic attacks were verified by com
puter data.
Three important findings of the
study were the assurance of the
reality of panic attacks, the increased
awareness of nighttime panic attacks,
and the knowledge that victims of at
tacks are not in real physical danger.
Although they are often terrified and
have a sense that they are going to
die, "they're physiologically not in

any danger. The heart rate rarely
goes to a level that is worrisome from
a medical standpoint," Taylor said.
One of the more significant fin
dings of the study was that the
nighttime panic attacks commonly
occurred from 1:30 a.m. to 3:30 a.m.,
at times when hormonal shifts nor
mally occur in the body. The Stanford
researchers are now investigating this
connection. Victims awaken at these
