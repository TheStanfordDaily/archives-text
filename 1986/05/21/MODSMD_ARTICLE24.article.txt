# 2nd career titles
## Feelings are different for the four seniors

ATHENS, Ga. — "It's one thing to come in as
NCAA champions, but it's another thing to leave as
NCAA champions," Stanford senior Dan Goldie said
yesterday after the Cardinal won the 1986 crown.
Not that many people are able to do either of those
things. Four Stanford seniors did both.
Goldie, Jim Grabb, John Letts and Eric Rosenfeld
were all in the starting lineup three years apo when the
Cardinal beat Southern Methodist University 5-4 for
the championship. Yesterday they ended their careers
in the same way that they began them.
As might be expected, however, their reactions to
this years accomplishment are not quite the same.
"Freshman year we were complete underdogs, and
we just went out there swinging," Letts said yesterday.
"When we won it, we were so naive. (This time) it's the
same kind of euphoria, but overall I feel different."
Three years can make you wiser and more apprecia
tive.
"I think everyone says they realize it more when
they win anything for a second time," Grabb said.
"(Freshman year) it didn't seem like that big a deal —
it was just supposed to happen. But it made this year

really satisfying."'
Having four seniors on the same team in college ten
nis is a rare thing. The lure of the professional tour of
ten takes players out of school. But not these four.
" A lot of us stayed in school to do this," Goldie said.
"(The championship) makes me look back on the
four years and puts it all in a good light," Rosenfeld
said. "Freshman year was a thrill in a different way.
This time it's just kind of warm and peaceful. I guess
this is a little deeper for me."
Stanford Coach Dick Gould got to see the seniors
through all four of those years, and he agrees that it is
different this time around. "Any two will be very dif
ferent," he said. "Freshman year they just got on a roll
early in the season and kept on winning. They also had
the great leadership of Scott Davis, so this time might
be better because they did it alone."
Some of the reporters here in Athens have asked
Gould why the seniors didn't win it all four years.
Gould put them in their place.
" Do you realize that in their sophomore year it was
4-4 in the finals with UCLA and the last doubles team
was up 4-3 in the third set?" he asked.
"Do you realize we gave Georgia (the eventual
champion) their toughest match of the whole tourna
ment last year? What more could you ask?"
