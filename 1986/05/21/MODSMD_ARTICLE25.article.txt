# Experience? Who needs it?
## Frosh Carey, Witmeyer and Sprague make quick impact 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
If three months ago you had told
Mark Marquess — the coach of Stan
ford's baseball team — that by year's
end three freshmen would have spots
in his starting lineup, Marquess
wouldn't have predicted much for his
Cardinal ballclub.
"I would have figured second divi
sion, somewhere down near the bot
tom," Marquess said. "I would've
thought we'd be staying home at this
point in the season."
Instead, Marquess' team is far from
home this week, in Stillwater, Okla.,
playing for one of the eight spots in
the College World Series.
With Marquess in Stillwater are
three freshman starters, each one
along for more than just the ride.
Shortstop Frank Carey, first baseman
Ron Witmeyer and designated hitter
Ed Sprague — rookies all — will have
plenty to say about just where the
Cardinal goes this weekend.
"You're just not supposed to do
what we've done with freshmen in the
lineup," Marquess said. "The first
year's supposed to be a time to learn,
not to play."
At least one member of the trio
agreed: "I didn't really expect to
come right in here and play," said
Carey, who started 44 of Stanford's
56 games this year.
For a little more than a month it
looked like all the three would do this
year would be learn. And learn the
hard way — on the bench. Marquess,
out of reflex, gave the starting spots
to more seasoned players.
"You always have a tendency to go
with the older players," Marquess
said. "It's only fair to give them a
chancel they've paid their dues."
Marquess' sense of equity soon
gave way to his baseball instincts. He
just couldn't keep the trio out of his
lineup.
"I'm of the philosophy that the best
people play," explained Marquess,
now in his 10th year as Stanford's
coach. "And when we thought they
were ready, we went with them."

"I didn't really expect to come right in here and play,'* freshman shortstop Frank Carey said. Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess wasn't expecting Carey, nor first baseman Ron Witmeyer nor designated hitter Ed Sprague,
to win a spot in the Cardinal lineup during his first season. But Carey has started 44 of Stanford's 56 games
and is fourth on the team in RBIs.
