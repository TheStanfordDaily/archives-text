# Experience? Who needs it?
## Frosh Carey, Witmeyer and Sprague make quick impact 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
If three months ago you had told
Mark Marquess — the coach of Stan
ford's baseball team — that by year's
end three freshmen would have spots
in his starting lineup, Marquess
wouldn't have predicted much for his
Cardinal ballclub.
"I would have figured second divi
sion, somewhere down near the bot
tom," Marquess said. "I would've
thought we'd be staying home at this
point in the season."
Instead, Marquess' team is far from
home this week, in Stillwater, Okla.,
playing for one of the eight spots in
the College World Series.
With Marquess in Stillwater are
three freshman starters, each one
along for more than just the ride.
Shortstop Frank Carey, first baseman
Ron Witmeyer and designated hitter
Ed Sprague — rookies all — will have
plenty to say about just where the
Cardinal goes this weekend.
"You're just not supposed to do
what we've done with freshmen in the
lineup," Marquess said. "The first
year's supposed to be a time to learn,
not to play."
At least one member of the trio
agreed: "I didn't really expect to
come right in here and play," said
Carey, who started 44 of Stanford's
56 games this year.
For a little more than a month it
looked like all the three would do this
year would be learn. And learn the
hard way — on the bench. Marquess,
out of reflex, gave the starting spots
to more seasoned players.
"You always have a tendency to go
with the older players," Marquess
said. "It's only fair to give them a
chancel they've paid their dues."
Marquess' sense of equity soon
gave way to his baseball instincts. He
just couldn't keep the trio out of his
lineup.
"I'm of the philosophy that the best
people play," explained Marquess,
now in his 10th year as Stanford's
coach. "And when we thought they
were ready, we went with them."

"I didn't really expect to come right in here and play,'* freshman shortstop Frank Carey said. Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess wasn't expecting Carey, nor first baseman Ron Witmeyer nor designated hitter Ed Sprague,
to win a spot in the Cardinal lineup during his first season. But Carey has started 44 of Stanford's 56 games
and is fourth on the team in RBIs.
work out for the best. Each of the
three made "freshman" mistakes.
Carey led the team in errors with 19;
his batting average hovered around
the .200 mark for much of the year.
Witmeyer, after hitting at a .340 clip
as a fill-in, watched his average dip
below .220 after he was installed as a
starter. And Sprague, after a short
lived trial at third base, hasn't played
in the field regularly for over a
month.
"We're really happy with the way
they've adjusted," Marquess said.
"They didn't start like a house
on fire, but they've all come around."
Have they ever come around.
Here's a brief review of their first
year accomplishments:
Trank Carey. The native of El
Cajon has started in all 30 of Stan
ford's Six-Pac games, and in 44 of the
team's 56 contests. The left-handed
hitter takes with him to the Midwes
tern Regional a .257 batting average
and 26 RBI (the fourth most on the
squad).
Carey, however, has had his ups

and downs. Before the fall he suf
fered a debilitating ankle injury —
called a severe sprain — which im
paired his speed. "One of his biggest
strengths was his speed," said
Marquess of Carey — who neverthe
less stole seven bases this year —
"but now he can't run for us."

And in midseason, he went through
a tortuous slump. His average plum
meted below the .200 plateau. Even
his fielding deteriorated — through
his first 22 games, he booted 11 balls.
Why did Marquess stick with his

wilting shortstop? "We (the coaches)
saw in him a good hitter; he had a
great fall and it was only a matter of
time before he snapped out of it."
Carey finished the year like the hit
ter Marquess thought he would be,
collecting 23 hits in his last 66 at-bats
(.348) with 16 RBI. And, discounting
a three-error game against Cal two
weeks ago, the shortstop has made
only four errors in Six-Pac play.
"I really appreciate that the
coaches stuck with me," Carey said.
" During my little slump, 1 felt like I
was letting them down."
Ron Witmeyer. Witmeyer, a year
out of high school in West Bayshore,
N.Y., has shown flashes of hitting
brilliance. His average was a glossy
.348 a month-and-a-half into the
season.
Then, like Carey, Witmeyer went
into a hitting dither. His average has
dropped to an unspectacular .219
(25-for-l 14).
"Since I've been starting, I haven't
been hitting well," Witmeyer said. "I
know I can do it. It's just a matter of
doing it."
Still, Marquess is convinced Wit
meyer is his man. "He had a spell
there," the coach said, "but he's

starting to bounce out of it now."
Witmeyer, who hits and throws
left-handed, poked his second homer
two weeks ago against Cal. He also
has three doubles and a pair of triples
on the year.
Through it all, Witmeyer showed a
slick glove. Marquess calls Witmeyer,

who was used as a late-inning defen
sive replacement for the first couple
of months, his best-fielding first
baseman. He hasn't committed an er
ror all year.
Despite his fielding prowess, Wit

meyer maintains he's at his best in the
batter's box, not straddling first base.
"1 consider my bat to be the best part
of my game."
Ed Sprague. Sprague, from Stock
ton, has swung a hot bat for Stanford
all year, and especially since he was
moved into the lineup to stay on
April 12 against Cal.
"He's hit the ball as hard as anyone
for us," said Marquess of Sprague,
who carries a .301 batting average
and has hit three homers. "And more
than that, he's had plenty of tough
luck outs. He's just a great hitter."
After an early-season trial at third
base, Sprague gave way to Ruben
Amaro at that position. The move
was more a matter of circumstance
than Sprague's failure. "I think Ed
can do an adequate job over there (at
third)," Marquess said.
Sprague, whose father owns a
single-A farm team in Stockton, has
been around baseball all his life.
That, Marquess felt, had a lot to do
with his smooth transition to college
baseball.
"You don't get more poised as a
freshman," Marquess said. "Of the
three, he's the most poised, most ma
ture. He's very self-confident."
