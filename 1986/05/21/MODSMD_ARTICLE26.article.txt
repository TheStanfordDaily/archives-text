### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas â€” Prior to her
second-round singles match yes
terday afternoon, Stanford's Patty
Fendick was sitting in the
grandstand at the Penick-Allison
Tennis Center, lamenting what a
difficult draw she has here at the
NCAA Women's Tennis Champi
onship,
If only all matches could be so
difficult. Fendick romped past
California's Karen Shirt 6-0, 6-0 to
advance to this morning's third
round.
Fendick will be joined at the
Tennis Center by teammate
Marianne Werdel, who also won
her first two matches yesterday.
Leigh Anne Eldredge, the Card
inal's other singles entry, lost a
heart-breaking three-set match to
No. 5 seed Beverly Bowes of
Texas yesterday morning.
Stanford's doubles teams split in
yesterday's first round as Fendick
and Eldredge won in straight sets
while Cari Hagey and Stephanie
Savides lost to the second-seeded
team of Gretchen Rush and Ann
Hulbert of Trinity.
Having to return to the courts
just one day after her thrilling up
set of USC's Caroline Kuhlman,
Fendick was slightly off her game
in her first-round match yesterday
against Miami's Ros Riach.
"She was a little flat in the first
one," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. "She had trouble
with her serve."
Fendick was good enough to
avoid a first-round upset,
however. She eliminated Riach 6-
3, 6-3.
After watching some of Shin's
morning match, Fendick took a
cautious attitude toward entering
the Stadium Court for her second
round match.
"I thought I'd be able to beat
Shin,'" Fendick said. "The way she
plays brings out the best in me.
(But) I was watching her (first
round) singles match, and she

looked great."
In the afternoon match, it was
Fendick who looked great. Make
that awesome. Shin scored only 15
points in the match as Fendick
bombarded her with
groundstrokes and volleys.
"I wasn't getting caught flat
footed like I was in the first
match," Fendick said.
The Stanford junior, seeded No.
6 in the tournament, plays Okla
homa State's Renata Baranski
today at 9 a.m.
"I know almost nothing about
her (Baranski)," Brennan said.
"She plays one for a good, solid
OSU team. I just don't think that
anybody's good enough to beat
Patty when Patty is playing well."
If she gets by Baranski, Fendick
will likely play Kuhlman at noon
in the quarterfinals.
In addition to Fendick, Werdel,
the No. 8 seed, is also seriously
seeking the title.
Yesterday, she knocked off
Duke's Sue Taylor, 7-5, 6-1 and
Trinity's Jane Holdren 7-5, 7-5 to
reach the third round.
"I thought she played really
well," Brennan said of Werdel's
performance against Holdren.
"She moves better than ever.
Holdren played a great match."
Holdren led 5-2 in the second
set and had set points in the eighth
and ninth games. But Werdel
overpowered her on all of the cru
cial points and won the last five
games of the set.
"She is a very good pressure
player," Brennan said. "She hits
out under pressure. She never
tightens up."
This morning. Werdel faces
Cal'sNo. 1 singles player, Heather
Ettus.
In the Eldredge-Bowes match,
the Stanford junior surprised the
highly ranked Texan by coming to
the net frequently and came tan
talizingly close to pulling off the
upset.
After losing 6-2 in the first set,
