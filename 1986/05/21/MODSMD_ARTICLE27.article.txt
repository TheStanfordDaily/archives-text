# Stanford's McCarthy a can't-miss tour prospect
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
If she finds the time, Stanford's
Kathleen McCarthy could become
a great name in the women's golf
ing world.
That's not to imply that the
junior from Fresno hasn't played as
much golf as she can. Rather, it
seems that all McCarthy needs to
ascend to the top levels of women's
golf is time to relax and reflect on
her play.
"(My mental state) is a lot better
this week," McCarthy said. "If you
had asked me last week, I would
have lied through my teeth."
McCarthy indicated that con
versations with her golf pro in the
past week have helped her get in the
proper frame of mind for the
NCAA Championships May 28-31
in Columbus, Ohio.
"He made me realize that I want
to be the best," McCarthy said.
"You kind of lose that edge, that
competitive edge — it's been so
long since I've been in the heat of
the tournament. I was very
confused, but he brought me out of
it. I don't want anything to stand in
my way."
"Everybody has to go through
(the tough times)," teammate Trish
McGonigle said. "She has had a lot
of them this year, but I think in the
long run she'll get a hold of it."
McCarthy didn't have many
tough times when she entered Stan
ford as the No. 1 golfing prospect in
the country. As a freshman,
McCarthy finished fifth in the
NCAA tournament, ranked third in
the nation with a 73.4 scoring
average and won several tourna
ments, including the Stanford Invi
tational, the California Intercol
legiate and the Desert Classic Invi
tational on her way to becoming a
first-team Ail-American.
* "She really made an impact on
college golf," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said.
The next year, McCarthy broke
the course record while winning the
Stanford Invitational for the second
straight year and made the All-
America second team, but she
began to have problems.
" After our fall season her sopho
more year," Baldwin said, "her
game started to get a little bit on
the erratic side, especially her tee
shot game. She did not have a very

strong winter or spring."
And though McCarthy admits
that she struggled after winning the
Stanford Invitational, she still em
barked on a heavy summer
schedule. It started off on a positive
note, as she won the Women's
Western Amateur in Michigan
shortly after final exams ended.
"That was an ironic win,"
McCarthy said. "(It was) really a
neat win because it was unex
pected. I didn't play well in any
thing else."
The last statement belies the fact
that she also tied for low amateur at
the Women's U.S. Open.
"A lot of it was sheer determina
tion," she noted. "I had a lot of me
chanical problems with my swing,
(but) I had committed myself to a

lot of tournaments so there was no
way to take off time."
McCarthy said she didn't have
any time to address those problems
before this season because, "when
I'm not playing summer golf, I'm
playing college golf."
"Kathleen has struggled this year
with her golf game," Baldwin said.
"She's learned an awful lot; I've
never seen an athlete in any sport
put in more effort or more time
than she has right now. She's a to
tally dedicated person."
McGonigle believes it is
McCarthy's attitude, which
McGonigle summed up as
"spunky," that has carried her
through this year.
"She won't let a bad round get

her down," McGonigle said. "She al
ways thinks tomorrow's going to be
better. She has a positive oujlook on
life.
"I love to meet people," McCarthy
said, "to talk to people. My most fun
hobby is to watch other athletes in ac
tion, doing what they do best ....
It'd be so much fun to live here and
not go to school."
McCarthy, a psychology major,
does plan to graduate, although she
may not do it in four years. Another
busy summer awaits her following na
tionals, including the prestigious
Curtis Cup tournament in Kansas,
where the eight top American
amateurs meet their British counter
parts.
"If there was ever a pro prospect in
the game of golf, Kathleen is it,"
Baldwin said. "She has as strong a
swing as any player on the tour. Pat
Leahy (former vice-president of the
U.S. Golfing Association) said he's
only ever seen two sure bets, Jo Anne
Carner and Kathleen McCarthy."

game started to get a little bit on
the erratic side, especially her tee
shot game. She did not have a very

strong winter or spring."
And though McCarthy admits
that she struggled after winning the
Stanford Invitational, she still em
barked on a heavy summer
schedule. It started off on a positive
note, as she won the Women's
Western Amateur in Michigan
shortly after final exams ended.
"That was an ironic win,"
McCarthy said. "(It was) really a
neat win because it was unex
pected. I didn't play well in any
thing else."
The last statement belies the fact
that she also tied for low amateur at
the Women's U.S. Open.
"A lot of it was sheer determina
tion," she noted. "I had a lot of me
chanical problems with my swing,
(but) I had committed myself to a

lot of tournaments so there was no
way to take off time."
McCarthy said she didn't have
any time to address those problems
before this season because, "when
I'm not playing summer golf, I'm
playing college golf."
"Kathleen has struggled this year
with her golf game," Baldwin said.
"She's learned an awful lot; I've
never seen an athlete in any sport
put in more effort or more time
than she has right now. She's a to

McCarthy's attitude, which

"spunky," that has carried her
through this year.

Life isn't always a stroll for Kathleen McCarthy, but the Stanford
golfing standout should walk right onto the women's professional
tour when her Cardinal playing days are over.

ways thinks tomorrow's going to be
better. She has a positive oujlook on
life.
"I love to meet people," McCarthy
said, "to talk to people. My most fun
hobby is to watch other athletes in ac
tion, doing what they do best ....
It'd be so much fun to live here and
not go to school."
McCarthy, a psychology major,
does plan to graduate, although she
may not do it in four years. Another
busy summer awaits her following na
tionals, including the prestigious
Curtis Cup tournament in Kansas,
where the eight top American
amateurs meet their British counter
parts.
"If there was ever a pro prospect in
the game of golf, Kathleen is it,"
Baldwin said. "She has as strong a
swing as any player on the tour. Pat
Leahy (former vice-president of the
U.S. Golfing Association) said he's
only ever seen two sure bets, Jo Anne
Carner and Kathleen McCarthy."
If she could just find the time. . .
If she finds the time, Stanford's
Kathleen McCarthy could become
a great name in the women's golf
ing world.
That's not to imply that the
junior from Fresno hasn't played as
much golf as she can. Rather, it
seems that all McCarthy needs to
ascend to the top levels of women's
golf is time to relax and reflect on
her play.
"(My mental state) is a lot better
this week," McCarthy said. "If you
had asked me last week, I would
have lied through my teeth."
McCarthy indicated that con
versations with her golf pro in the
past week have helped her get in the
proper frame of mind for the
NCAA Championships May 28-31
in Columbus, Ohio.
"He made me realize that I want
to be the best," McCarthy said.
"You kind of lose that edge, that
competitive edge — it's been so
long since I've been in the heat of
the tournament. I was very
confused, but he brought me out of
it. I don't want anything to stand in
my way."
"Everybody has to go through
(the tough times)," teammate Trish
McGonigle said. "She has had a lot
of them this year, but I think in the
long run she'll get a hold of it."
McCarthy didn't have many
tough times when she entered Stan
ford as the No. 1 golfing prospect in
the country. As a freshman,
McCarthy finished fifth in the
NCAA tournament, ranked third in
the nation with a 73.4 scoring
average and won several tourna
ments, including the Stanford Invi
tational, the California Intercol
legiate and the Desert Classic Invi
tational on her way to becoming a
first-team Ail-American.
* "She really made an impact on
college golf," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said.
The next year, McCarthy broke
the course record while winning the
Stanford Invitational for the second
straight year and made the All-
America second team, but she
began to have problems.
