Philippine commission seizes stock
MANILA, Philippines — A Philippine presidential commission yes
terday seized 33.1 million shares of the country's largest private com
pany, the San Miguel Corp. brewery, on grounds that a leading associate
of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos was secretly involved in a recent
controversial transaction as the buyer and seller of the shares.
The order by the Presidential Commission on Good Government to
"sequester" the shares, which comprise 30 percent of outstanding capi
tal stock and give the commission effective control of San Miguel, high
lighted a growing public debate about the role in private business of
President Corazon Aquino's government as it tries to recover the wealth
of Marcos, his family and associates.
The sequestration order was sharply protested by Defense Minister
Juan Ponce Enrile, who has been at loggerheads with the commission
over moves to intervene in a telecommunications company in which he
has a financial stake.
In one of the largest stock exchange deals recorded here, acting San
Miguel chairman Andres Soriano nominally purchased the shares April
1 from 14 companies for nearly $ 166 million, amounting to a per-share
price nearly four times higher than the shares were trading for at the
time. Soriano, 35, whose wealthy family had long controlled the beer
and food conglomerate, said he was acting on his own behalf and as an
agent for unidentified investors in the purchase.
However, the good-government commission said it uncovered
"conclusive evidence" that the shares were owned by Eduardo
Cojuangco, the country's wealthiest businessman and a leading associate
of Marcos. Cojuangco acquired them from Soriano's father in a 1983
takeover battle.
Soviets name new U.S. ambassador
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union yesterday named Yuri
Dubinin, a career diplomat now assigned to the United Nations, as am
bassador to the United States.
Dubinin, 55, replaces Anatoly Dobrynin, who became a member of
the Secretariat of the Communist Party Central Committee in March
after serving an unprecedented 24 years in Washington, during which he
became a close acquaintance of several U.S. presidents.
The appointment of Dubinin only two months after his accreditation
as Moscow's permanent representative to the United Nations caught his
colleagues there by surprise, but they agreed almost unanimously that he
had the qualifications for his new post.
Dubinin is considered by foreign observers to be a member of the new
generation of Soviet diplomats and, therefore, like Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, well-tailored and highly conscious of public relations.
Dubinin, after an assignment in Paris in the 19505, served in Moscow's
Foreign Ministry in 1960-63. He returned to France, where he held
senior positions in the Paris embassy for five years. From 1971 to 1978,
he headed the Foreign Ministry's first European Department and then
spent eight years as ambassador to Spain.
Third kidnapping suspect killed
SAN SALVADOR. El Salvador — A former police detective
suspected of being a member of a kidnapping ring was killed Sunday by
unidentified gunmen, officials here said yesterday.
The victim, Edgar Linares, is the third suspect in the widely publicized
kidnapping case to be killed in ususual circumstances.
According to officials, Linares was shot in the throat as he drove along
a highway in the western province of Santa Ana. An anonymous tele
phone caller told a local newspaper that Linares had been "machine
gunned because he belonged to a band of kidnappers the whole world
knows."
Later, officials confirmed that the victim was Linares, who had been at
large since the alleged ring was exposed last month.
The kidnapping ring, which is said to have included several military
officers, abducted at least five wealthy Salvadorans for ransom totaling
more than $3 million. The case has attracted attention throughout the
country because by tradition the military has been immune from punish
ment in criminal cases.
One of the suspects in the case, Ramon Erasmo Oporto, was found
hanged in his jail cell. Another suspect, Moises Lopez Arriola, was shot
to death, allegedly by a night watchman who thought he was a burglar.
Kohl campaign investigations end
BONN, West Germany — Two state investigations against West Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl for alleged lies in connection with illegal
campaign contributions will be dropped today, the mass-circulation Bild
newspaper reported yesterday.
Observers in Koblenz, where Kohl faces one of the two probes, sup
ported the newspaper's report, although a spokesman for the West Ger
man Prosecutor's Office said the proceedings had not yet been closed.
Meanwhile, Otto Schily, a leading member of the Greens party and
the initiator of the investigations, has requested access to the investiga
tions' files. He said he was "astonished" that Kohl had not yet appeared
for a hearing in connection with the investigation.
Kohl has been subject to investigation in his home state of Rhineland-
Palatinate since February and in Bonn since mid-March.
Schily, who took part in a federal parliamentary inquiry into party
donations by the giant Flick concern, requested the investigations in Jan
uary on suspicion that Kohl had given false evidence on two occasions
last year.
Kohl is alleged to have lied when he denied knowledge of large-scale
tax avoidance schemes in return for political contributions between 1969
and 1980.
Waldheim's candidacy not a factor
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 has told Is
rael that Kurt Waldheim's candidacy for president of Austria will not be
a factor in deciding whether to bar the former U.N. secretary general
from the United States. But Meese did not say whether he will make a
decision before the Austrian election on June 8.
Meese's assurance that the election will not be allowed to influence
the Justice Department's inquiry into Waldheim's Word War II record
was given to Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir during Meese's visit to Is
rael last week, sources familiar with the investigation said yesterday.
Neal Sher, heacf of Justice's Office of Special Investigations, recom
mended last month that Waldheim be put on the "watch list" of persons
not permitted to enter this country because of charges that he was in
volved in wartime atrocities against Yugoslav partisans.
Waldheim, who was U.N. secretary general from 1972 to 1982, has
denied the charges as based on false testimony from unreliable wit
nesses. He narrowly failed to win the required majority when Austrians
voted for president earlier this month and is regarded as the front
runner in the June 8 runoff election.
The House, responding to pleas from members who want a quick deci
sion. yesterday adopted a resolution urging Meese to make a speedy in
vestigation of Waldheim's past. The voice vote came after the House
Judiciary Committee approved the resolution. 31-0, earlier in the day.
The congressional action appeared to reflect suspicion that the
Reagan Administration might be seeking to delay a decision until after
June 8 in order to avoid charges of U.S. interference in Austria's internal
affairs.
