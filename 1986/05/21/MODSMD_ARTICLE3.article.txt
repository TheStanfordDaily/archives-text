# Aurora aims to enlighten

### LAURA STEPP 
This is the third in a series of articles about student
publications on campus.
Unconventional.
That's probably the best word to describe Aurora
— the only feminist newspaper on campus. This
quarterly publication is unique in more ways than
one.

Feature

What most people recognize about Aurora is that
it focuses on feminist issues and concerns. However,
the feminist direction of the paper is not the most
unconventional aspect of Aurora. Rather, it is the
fact that that Aurora is a "collective" that makes it
very different from the majority of student publica
tions on campus.
What exactly is a "collective?"
Senior Kristen Smith, a member of the Aurora
collective, explained: "Every person in the group
takes equal responsibility for production of the
paper and people take on projects as they come up.
In addition, everything that we do
is agreed upon by consensus deci
sion."
Aurora has been a collective
since it was founded about 10 years
ago. Karie Youngdahl, a junior
who has been a member of the col
lective for three years, said
Aurora's choice to be a collective
was based on philosophical
grounds.
"The collective functions so that
all of us work together equally,"
Youngdahl said. "The idea of a col
lective was Aurora's vision from
the beginning. Its intention is to try
and dissolve the strains of hierarchy
that you find in many of the student
groups on campus."
Because of its collective nature,
the group is very changeable. Last
year's Aurora staff consisted of
only three people, but this year its
staff has grown to 15.
According to Youngdahl, there
has been "a sudden resurgence of
interest (in Aurora) this year. I'm
not sure exactly why, but we sure
are happy about it."
Nevertheless, one might expect
that some problems could arise
from Aurora's lack of centralized
leadership. But members of the
publication's staff said that though
the production process may be
time-consuming, it has its benefits.
Jen Grant, a Stanford graduate
who is currently working in the
area, said she enjoys working in a
collective.
"You get more out of it," she
said. "The environment is much
more supportive, and by emphasiz
ing the group, each member feels
more a part of it. . . . At the same
time, the load of work isn't dumped
on one person."

Grant also noted that the group
never has one person to "run
things" — instead, the various jobs
at Aurora rotate through its mem
bership weekly.
"We hope that the group is able
to build unity as well as diversity in
this way." said senior Kate Wade.
"The paper constantly changes
character because it travels with the
whim of the group's feeling."
Aurora staffers stressed that
anyone can join the collective.
Meetings are not arranged on par
ticular days, so interested students
can contact current Aurora mem

bers.
Members also said Aurora tries
to achieve a wider scope of view
points by soliciting articles from
different groups on campus.
All submissions are reviewed and
approved by the collective. Ma
terial appropriate for Aurora may
be anything relevant to feminist
thought — articles, graphics,
poetry, essays, fiction, photogra
phy, etc. Articles by members of
the Stanford community are gener
ally accepted.
The next issue of Aurora is
planned for the end of this quarter.
