# Botha seeks to justify raids

### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President
Pieter Botha sought yesterday to justify South
Africa's military raids into three neighboring black
states in terms of the U.S. raid on Libya last month
and declared that Pretoria would not allow "the
double standards and hypocrisy of the Western
world" to support the Libyan attacks while
denouncing South Africa's military action.
As world condemnation of Monday's South
African attacks inteasified, a series of statements
by government spokesmen and editorials in pro
government newspapers here all hit the same
theme — that South Africa, like the United States,
was justified in combatting a source of terrorism.
The South Africans' target, the African National
Congress, is waging a guerrilla war to overthrow
the country's apartheid system of segregation and
white-minority rule.
In a speech to the white-dominated Parliament
in Cape Town Tuesday afternoon, Botha quoted
President Reagan's words after the Libyan raid,
saying self-defense was not only America's right
but its duty, and that the mission was fully consis
tent with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter,
which justifies defense against aggression.
Both the White House and the State Department
on yesterday denounced the South African raids
and rejected any parallel between the ANC and the
Libyan government of Col. Moammar Khadafy.
In Lusaka, Zambia, the ANC, the main black
resistance group, yesterday pledged to intensify its

sabotage campaign inside South Africa and called
on the United States to intensify pressure on
Pretoria to end apartheid.
Like Reagan after Libya, Botha found yesterday
that most of his home constituency supports his
military action while outsiders are critical.
Businessmen and white liberals have criticized

the attacks. Colin Eglin, leader of the small Pro
gressive Federal Party, condemned the raids as "a
major political blunder" that would invite interna
tional sanctions, increase racial tensions and make
black states in the region more dependent on the
Soviet Union.
In Moscow, the Kremlin yesterday joined in
criticizing the attacks, noting a "sinister link" be
tween the South African raids and the U.S. attack
on Libya and calling the two countries' actions
"analogous in style and method."
Canada indicated disapproval of the raids by
temporarily recalling its ambassador for consulta
tions.
Among blacks the reaction is diametrically oppo
site. Few polls are conducted among the voteless
black majority, but the sentiment there has become
so intense during the past two years of violent
protest in the segregated townships that opinion
polling seems unnecessary.
In his speech yesterday, Botha sought to cast the
ANC in the same light as Libya and the Palestine
Liberation Organization. He claimed there was a
friendly relationship between the ANC and the
PLO and said that both had sent guerrillas to Libya
as well as to Angola for training.
"The ANC's ties with the executor of terrorism
whom President Reagan had identified as 'the mad
dog of the Middle East' " were well established,
Botha said.
