# Pentagon warns that treaty may cause harm

### 
WASHINGTON — The State De
partment and the Pentagon went to
battle with each other yesterday over
a proposed peace treaty for Central
America, with the Department of
Defense warning that a pact
promoted by State Department en
voy Philip Habib would harm U.S. in
terests.
The Pentagon, in an unusual policy
report, said that the draft treaty to
end the U.S.-backed rebels' guerrilla
war in Nicaragua could eventually re
quire the commitment of 100,000
U.S. troops to the region at a cost of
as much as $9.1 billion a year.
A senior State Department official
responded by calling the document
"the worst report they've produced
over there in a very long time."
At issue was the peace treaty
drafted by Latin America's Con
tadora Group of nations, which
would require leftist-ruled Nicaragua
to cut its ties to the Soviet Union and
move toward internal democracy in
exchange for an end to the contras'

guerrilla war.
Reagan and Secretary of State
George Shultz have declared their
support for the Contadora proposal
and have sent veteran negotiator
Habib to Central America to work
for a treaty that would meet U.S. con
cerns.
At the State Department, a senior
official speaking on the condition of
anonymity said: "I don't know what
those guys are smoking in the Pent
agon. They don't seem to understand
the Administration's policy."
State Department spokesman
Charles Redman said that the report,
written as an internal study and
"released without authority," had
"no standing as a United States gov
ernment document."
But a Pentagon official declared
that "it is a Defense Department
document." The title, "Prospect for
Containment of Nicaragua's Commu
nist Government," appears under the
Department of Defense seal on the
cover.
