# Reagan tries to save arms sale to Saudis
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — With his
proposed $354 million Saudi arms
sale facing certain defeat in
Congress, President Reagan
sought to salvage part of the pack
age yesterday by pledging to elimi
nate the controversial Stinger
ground-to-air missiles.
Secretary of State George
Shultz disclosed the president's
plan during a closed meeting with
Senate Republicans. He said the
decision was made in a meeting
earlier in the day between Reagan
and Prince Bandar ibn Sultan,
Saudi ambassador to the United
States.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
who has led the opposition to the
sale, called the offer an admission
of defeat by Reagan and Saudi
Arabia. "The Administration and
the Saudis have thrown in the
towel," he said.
But Cranston also acknowl
edged that the move could succeed

in softening congressional opposi
tion to the plan and rescue Reagan
from an embarrassing foreign
policy defeat.
The president has the authority
to approve arms sales to foreign
countries unless both chambers of
Congress vote agaiast it. He then
has the right to veto their resolu
tion of disapproval, but Congress
can override the veto by a two
thirds majority in both chambers.
Reagan is expected to veto the
resolution of disapproval today. If
one chamber of Congress fails to
override the veto, the sale can take
place.
However, in both the House
and Senate, the original votes
against the sale exceeded the two
thirds necessary to override a veto.
The Senate voted 73 to 22 against
it; the House vote was 356-62,
The combined action marked the
first time that Congress has ever
disapproved a weapons sale.
