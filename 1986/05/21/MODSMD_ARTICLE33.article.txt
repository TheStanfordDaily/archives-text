Biotech rules approved
WASHINGTON — The White House Domes
tic Policy Council approved yesterday and sent to
President Reagan a document. that establishes
rules for regulating the biotechnology industry
and is likely to shape the government's attitude
toward commercial gene engineering for years.
The document has been awaited for more than
a year, and some companies reportedly have
withheld products from the regulatory process
until they could see how the rules would affect
them.
David Kingsbury, chairman of the White
House's Biological Sciences Coordinating Com
mittee (BSCC), which coordinated formulation
of the new policy, said Reagan is expected to ap
prove it this week.
Biotechnology products include drugs,
vaccines, pesticides and plants with new proper
ties. For example, one product being developed
by Monsanto Co. of St. Louis mixes genes of two
bacteria to create a new organism that can poison
one of its key pest enemies.
The document states, in effect, that each prod
uct should be considered separately and not be
subject to regulation solely because it was made

by genetic-engineering techniques, he said.
One of the document's most controversial
provisions exempts a large group of genetically
engineered products from additional regulation.
For example, experiments that simply cut
genes from an organism, a process called
"deletion," will be exempt from regulation.
Three of the first four products to be reviewed at
the EPA and the US DA are "deletion" cases
that probably would not undergo regulatory
review unless found to fall into some other reg
ulated category, such as organisms that may
cause disease.
Growth rate increases
WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy grew
at a healthy 3.7 percent rate during the first three
months of the year, the Commerce Department
said yesterday. Although the government report
uncovered some weakness that could retard
growth during the current quarter, most analysts
are now convinced that the economy will im
prove strongly later this year, probably beginning
by early summer.
After an unusually long period of sluggish

growth that began nearly two years ago, "the
economy has gotten a sedond wind," said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman
Brothers, a major New York investment firm.
"We could be on the verge of two to three years
of renewed solid growth."
The January-to-March growth rate was the
highest since the first quarter of last year, when
the gross national product also gained 3.7 per
cent. Growth in the fourth quarter of last year
was only 0.7 percent.
The 3.7 percent figure represented an upward
revision of last month's estimate that the nation's
output of goods and services had grown at a 3.2
percent annual rate in the first quarter. Most
analysts had expected growth to be weaker than
originally estimated.
Prices close higher
NEW YORK — The stock market registered a
substantial gain yesterday, bolstered mainly by
renewed speculation of possible interest rate cuts
and a sharp decline in oil prices, analysts said.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up
25.80 points at 1783.98.
