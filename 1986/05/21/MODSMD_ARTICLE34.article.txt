Shuttle launch delayed
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE —The
first West Coast launch of a military space
shuttle, once scheduled this summer, may be
delayed until the early 19905, according to a pub
lished report.
The possibility of a five or six-year postpone
ment, or mothballing the Vandenberg shuttle
facility, was raised in the May 19 issue of the
respected aerospace weekly magazine, Aviation
Week and Space Technology.
A Pentagon spokesman said no decision has
been made yet about postponement, and he
denied that the Air Force was re-examining shut
ting down the Vandenberg shuttle flights in the
wake of the explosion of the shuttle Challenger
off Florida that killed seven astronauts,
Larry Hannon, a civilian spokesman for the
Air Force's Space Division in Los Angeles, said
that from NASA's point of view the military
shuttle's schedule has been complicated by the
fact that NASA would have to make a shuttle

available to the Air Force.
As late as last week, the new shuttle manager,
Rear Adm. Richard Truly, told a congressional
committee that he estimates the first launch from
Vandenberg will be no earlier than spring of
1988, and possibly later.
Agent testifies at trial
SAN RAFAEL — A state investigator tes
tified yesterday about the unsuccessful hunt for
Stephen Bingham, who was a fugitive for 13
years after a 1971 prison escape attempt left six
people dead.
Special Agent Norman Gard of the state De
partment of Justice was the last witness Prosecu
tor Terry Boren called before resting his case in
the 7-week-old trial.
Bingham, now 44. is charged with two counts
of murder and one count of conspiracy for al
legedly slipping a pistol to militant inmate
George Jackson during a 1971 attorney-client

visit at San Quentin prison.
Boren alleges Jackson hid the pistol and two
ammunition clips under an Afro wig and then
used the gun to force guards in his maximum
security cellblock to release about two dozen
Other inmates. Three guards and two inmate
trusties died in the resulting violence and Jackson
was gunned down by guards as he ran toward an
outside wall, Boren says.
In other testimony yesterday, firearms expert
David Burd testified the gun Bingham is accused
of giving to Jackson was the one that killed one of
the guards in the escape attempt.
