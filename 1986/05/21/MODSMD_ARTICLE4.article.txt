# Tempers flare at forum

### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
Tempers flared last night in Kresge Auditorium as
Stanford students, faculty and administrators debated the
purpose and the future of the Western Culture program,
an undergraduate distribution requirement.
During the forum — entitled "Western Culture: Educa
tion or Miseducation?" — seven panelists aired their
views on the Western Culture tracks to approximately 400
students.
Bill King, a member of the Black Student Union (BSU)
Western Culture committee, introduced the forum by
saying, "We are here tonight to question and to change.
We must ask, does Western Culture represent the West?
Is it culture? And if it is, then whose culture is it?"
Several panelists took the opportunity to severely
criticize the Western Culture program. Critics charged that
Western Culture tracks almost exclusively study works by
white male Christian authors and ignore the vital contri
butions to Western civilization made by people of other
races, sex and religions.
Panel member Michael Schmitz, a graduate student,
said, "The Western Culture program gives intellectual
justification to sexism, racism, and national chauvinism."
According to panelist Velina Underwood, "Injustices
to Third World people are compounded by the Western
Culture program, which ignores their contributions to our
culture. This denial goes beyond ignorance; it is institu
tionalized racism."
And panelist Renato Rosaldo, anthropology professor.

said the Western Culture program says to minority and
female students, " 'Welcome to Stanford, now sit down
and shut up.' It is a way of erasing their identities."
Three panelists, including two University administra
tors, defended the Western Culture requirement and dis
cussed its history here at Stanford. The three remained
calm during passionate criticism of the program and them
selves.
The three admitted the program had several faults.
However, they held that the program is flexible and open
to change.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Carolyn Lougee
said, "1 feel we are better off sharing a common freshman
humanities experience (than not), but perhaps not as well
off as we could be."
Lougee said she was not loathe to question and change
the existing tracks and added that there wasn't a polariza
tion of interests between herself and the critics of the
Western Culture program. "We should all recognize that
we have a common interest," she said. "We all want the
best courses at the core of the Stanford undergraduate
education."
Norman Wessells, dean of Humanities and Sciences,
assured students that faculty members in the program
were aware of and open to student criticisms. He said
change in the program by faculty would be forthcoming.
Yet despite encouraging and sympathetic comments
from Lougee, Wessells and Classics Prof. Mark Edwards,
members of the audience seemed to remain unconvinced

that change in the program was im
minent.
During the question-and-answer
period that followed the panelists'
statements, one student reminded
Lougee that he had talked with her
about reforming the program five
years ago. "You've made promises
for reforms before. Why should we
trust you now?" he asked.
Lougee answered, "I don't think
the question is whether you can trust
me, but I think the question is
whether the outcome of these discus
sions will be different, and I think the
answer is yes."
