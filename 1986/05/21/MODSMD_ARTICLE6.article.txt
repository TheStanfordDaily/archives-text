# GLAS, ASSU fight over funds promise
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
A two-month dispute between the
ASSU Senate Appropriations Com
mittee and the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance at Stanford (GLAS) ended last
night with the senate approving al
locations to the group, but only after
a GLAS representative withdrew his
request for the funding.
Appropriations Committee Chair
Jim DeLaHunt apologized repeatedly
during the senate meeting for what he
called "several bad decisions."
GLAS member Jeff Zimman who
coordinates the AIDS Education
Project (AEP), assailed the Appro
priations Committee's mix-ups con
cerning GLAS requests for funding.
"Either the Appropriations Com
mittee has acted recklessly and ir
responsibly, or maliciously and
deceitfully," Zimman said.
Expressing his surprise at the
move, Zimman said he might
"recommend the tactic to other stu
dent groups," since he "suddenly got
the money just by withdrawing the
request."
The dispute originated with
GLAS's request for ASSU funding in
April. After dividing up the organiza
tion into GLAS, AIDS Education
Project (AEP) and Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week (GALA Week),
the Appropriations Committee then
began a series of delays and funding
cuts in the process of allocating the

money.
According to Zimman, the three
groups received "assurances that we
would receive adequate funding"
after a meeting with the Appropria
tions Committee. Because of this
promise, "we went ahead and
planned programs, which we have
since had to cancel because no fund
ing ever arrived," Zimman said.
In particular, the group had to can
cel an AIDS antibody panel and a
medical lecture on AIDS, both part
of AEP activities. "Because of bu
reaucratic inefficiencies, valuable
programming didn't happen at Stan
ford," Zimman said.
Referring to the decision to split
the organization into three separate
groups, DeLaHunt said,"The delay in
trying to fix the bad decision was
worse than the first mistake." He
added that "some organizations have
been jerked around an awful lot" in
the appropriations process.
DeLaHunt said the allocations
given to the groups last night are in
tended make up for damage done.
The money will not be earmarked for
any particular program, but is consid
ered "a donation to the AEP."
Zimman said that although he is
"suspicious as to what strings are at
tached to the money" the ASSU has
allocated, he welcomes the funds
since "we always have a lot of pro
gramming ideas we'd like to put into
effect."
