### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Staff writer 
Seven candidates seeking the Republican and
Democratic nominations to California's 12th
congressional district — which includes Stanford
— debated the merits of their campaigns yester
day at a lunchtime forum in White Plaza.
The event, sponsored by the Student Activist
Network Political Action Committee
(STANPAC), Stanford-in-Government and the
Stanford Republicans, featured Republicans
Tom Skornia, Ernie Konnyu, John Mercer and
Laddie Hughes, and Democrats Sean McCarthy,
Lance Weil and Mel Emerick. Also making pre
sentations were world record-holding triple
jumper Willie Banks, speaking on behalf of
Senator Alan Cranston and 22nd District State
Assembly hopeful Chuck Quackenbush.
University President Donald Kennedy intro
duced the forum, urging students to "listen and

ask questions . . . because in California, primary
elections really matter."
Skornia, who spoke first among the_congres
sional candidates, stressed his commitment to
change, and criticized Konnyu's record in the
California assembly. Skornia called Konnyu the
front-runner in the race.
Konnyu focused on domestic issues during his
three-minute speech. The federal deficit will
"destroy to value of the dollar," he said. If the
problem isn't solved, "you will not have the kind
of jobs you're working for and hoping for," he
warned.
Concluding the presentations, Weil said,
"students have historically been the eyes and ears
of this country" and called for Stanford students
to "send a message to Washington" protesting
the Reagan Administration's policies.
In addition to the candidates who spoke, rep
resentatives were on hand from the U.S. Senate

campaigns of Bruce Herschensohn, Ed Zschau
and Mike Antonovich," Lieut. Governor Leo
McCarthy's reelection campaign, John
Garamendi's campaign for state controller and
Byron Sher's Assembly campaign.
STANPAC co-chairmen and faire organizers
Mike Tuchin and Mike Bunzel considered the
faire successful.
"This is one of the first times [all seven con
gressional candidates] were speaking in the same
place," Tuchin said.
Bunzel said STANPAC will take an active part
in the local campaigns prior to the June 3 prima
ries. By renting vans to "get out the vote" on
election day, STANPAC hopes to "make a big
difference in the election," he said.
Looking further into the future, Bunzel and
Tuchin said they hope STANPAC will play an in
creased role in this fall's general election cam-
