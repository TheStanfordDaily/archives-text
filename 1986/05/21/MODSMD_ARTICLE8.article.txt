"I really mean it when T say that
fraternities should be praised" for
hosting events "other than the ser
ving of copious amounts of alcohol in
short periods of time," University
President Donald Kennedy said last
night.
Kennedy and about 30 other admi
nistrators, resident fellows and fac
ulty members joined the Sigma Chis
for a happy hour and dinner buffet at
their house yesterday.

The Sigma Chis hosted the early
evening soiree to open avenues of
communication between their mem
bers and University officials.
Jon Christensen, Sigma Chi presi
dent, said that lack of dialogue and
interaction between fraternities and
other groups is behind an increasing
anti-fraternity sentiment at Stanford.
"A lot of Lthat sentiment] comes
from not knowing what's going on,"
Christensen said. "This is a crucial
time for fraternities to evaluate what
it is they have to offer."
Fraternities must justify their exis

tence at the Univeristy and maintain
an identity which they stand for, ac
cording to Christensen. "It doesn't
have to be a milk-and-cookies type
thing," he said, "but you must be able
to argue what you're about."
Kennedy appears at a handful of
row residences each quarter, accord
ing to Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
president.
Some faculty members said they
had never been invited to or attended
a Greek function here, Christensen
said.
