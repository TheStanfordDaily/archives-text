# Confronting alcohol at Stanford
## 
### 
Some topics have been con
cerns for so long that discuss
ing them no longer seems to
have an impact. One such area
is the abuse of alcohol at Stan
ford.
Almost everyone agrees that
alcohol saturates many
campus parties. Most people
recognize that consumption
of alcohol is often the crite
rion people use to decide
whether a party was success
ful.
Most students know some
one who cannot wait for the
weekend so he or she can get
drunk. And almost every RA
has had to care for a student
who passed out from a drink
ing game or had to clean up
after someone who had one
too many.
The concept of "one too
many" that needs to be dealt
with. Alcohol is sometimes at
tributed with almost superor
dinant powers: it can define a
good time, reveal one's courage
(as with students who feel
obligated to play drinking
games), or show the generosity
of one's host. "One too many"
is a problem that deserves more
attention than a nod of the head
and then instant dismissal.
Alcohol abuse is a problem
at Stanford. It becomes a

problem when someone feels
that saying "no" to a drink, or
refusing to participate in a
drinking game, means that
one will not be accepted or is
somehow a coward.
Alcohol may serve to
"grease the wheels" at a
party, but it becomes a prob
lem when students depend on
it to facilitate social
encounters.
The staff of the Infirmary has
seen frequent, serious conse
quences to alcohol misuse.
The most dangerous and dra
matic instances occur when
students are brought in with
alcohol poisoning after an
evening of partying.
But the Infirmary staff more
frequently deals with students
who need care for injuries in
curred when they were intox
icated. Many students are
brought in as casualties of
drinking games. Once again,
peer pressure seems to be the
culprit.
But there are ways to begin
to combat alcohol abuse. As
an individual, you can:
• know when and if you want
to drink and stick to your
choice;
• make a decision about how
you want to participate in so
cial gatherings regarding alco

hoi before you go;
• evaluate the influence your
friends' and colleagues'
opinions about drinking have
on you;
• and remind yourself that
refusing a drink is not rude,
while trying to push a drink on
someone who doesn't want
one is.
As a host and freind, you
can:
• make alcohol an adjunct to a
party rather than its central ac
tivity;
• plan things for people to do
other than eating and drink
ing;
• make sure that non
alcoholic beverages are
accessible, attractive, and
prominent at parties;
• and regulate the flow of al
cohol by having someone
serve drinks at a party.
Ultimately, choosing or
refusing a drink becomes a
personal choice. The need to
make a choice does not end
when you leave Stanford. The
unexamined use of alcohol
readily evolves into a habit:
the habit of going along with
the group's definition of
having a good time rather than
formulating your own.
Alcohol is a part of our cul

ture and seems likely to con
tinue to have an impact.
However, the potential for
misuse makes it imperative to
examime its possible dangers.
Warning signs of a drinking
problem:
Does someone you know:
• drink to build up confidence?
• drink to escape from worries,
stress, or troubles?
• lose time from work or school
because of drinking?
• have loss of memory or loss of
control while or after drinking?
• drink alone or try to hide
drinking?
• embarrass, harm, or worry
family or friends with drinking
behavior?
• seem irritable, defensive,
jealous, moody, or easily an
gered after drinking?
• deny everything or get upset if
you complain about his or her
drinking?
• feel guilty, worthless, or de
pressed due to drinking behav
ior?
• avoid friends or social
activities because of drinking?
One or more "yes" answer indi

cates a possible drinking prob
lem. What do you do when it
affects a person you care about?
To start face the truth (denying
that there's a problem won't
help), work to understand your

attitudes toward drinking, and
learn more about alcoholism.
