# Shoes make the game
## Running shoes 
### 
Using the correct shoes
when exercising is of utmost
importance both for the safety
and enjoyment of the sport.
Careful consideration should
be given to available styles and
features before a pair is pur
chased and before an activity
is started.
Running shoes should be
strongest in the area of cus
hioning, support and stability
while still retaining a
reasonable degree of
flexibility, softness and light
ness.
Always use the correct shoe
for the sport as shoes are de
signed with function in mind.
For example, tennis should
not be played while wearing
running shoes.
Always have both feet mea
sured, in a standing position.
(While wearing your athletic
socks.)
It is preferable to buy your
shoes late in the afternoon.
This is when your feet are
most swollen, and therefore
closely reproduces their size
during athletic activity.
Besides good fit and comfort,
there are certain things to con
sider when investing in ath
letic shoe gear.
Certain features of shoes
may vary from one sport to the
next, but to allow for optimum
foot function, consider the
following:
1. The sole of the shoe
should be durable on the
outside and should offer
enough flexibility at the bail of
the foot (not the arch) so it can
be bent easily by hand. When
propelling off toward the next
step, if the flexibility is not
available at the ball then the
Achilles tendon and ' calf
muscles may be overstressed.
2. There should be adequate
cushioning beneath the ball of
the foot. The insole should be
firm yet offer enough shock
absorption. With running,
much pressure is exerted in
this area and especially so with
sprinting.
3. There should be a good
heel cup to hold in the heel,
but it should not be too tight.
4. The heel counter of the
shoe should be firm for sup
port and well padded, so that

the heel of the foot is
stabilized. If the heel counter
is not firm, it can allow for too
much side-to-side motion
which may lead to injuries.
(Try squeezing the heel
counter to check stability.)
5. The heel should have
good shock absorption
qualities to reduce the impact
at heel strike. This will lessen
strain to the tendons, muscles
and other structures above the
foot. A slightly elevated heel
(about 12-15 mm) lessens
strains to the back of the legs.
6. The toe box should offer
room for the toes to wiggle,
but the front of the foot
should not slide from side to
side since blisters may result.
The toes should not touch the
end of the shoes, as the feet
will swell with activity and the
pressure will increase. Allow
about 1/2" from the longest
toe to the tip of the shoe.
7. The tongue and upper of
the shoe should be well
padded, and should be fas
hioned to stay in place while
running.
8. Heel width: Runners in
training land on their heels
and need a wide, stable plat
form. Slightly flared heels add
extra cushioning at heel strike,
but if they are too wide, nor
mal shock absorption is not
allowed, and excess stresses
may occur to the legs, and
knees.
Helpful Hints for Runners
As most runners know, run
ning is easy and can be done
just about anywhere. The ben
eficial effect on the heart and
lungs and overall conditioning
are well documented. The
positive mental effects have
been found to be most
desirable as well.
Running results in forces
that resemble 3-4 times that of
body weight, and during each
mile there are about 1,000 foot
strikes. That means that for
every mile we run, an accum
ulated force of about 1/2 mil
lion pounds is transmitted
through each foot (of the
average 125 lb. runner).

sideration it is easy to see why
