# Heat and exercise
## 
### 
In Hot Weather
• Exercise during the coolest
times of day.
• Exercise in the coolest
places, where there is shade.
• Wear little or loose-fitting,
light-colored cotton clothing
and a light colored hat.
• Replenish your body fluids

with a drink of cool water.
• Splash yourself with water,
which will evaporate and cool
your body.
• If you cannot take any
preventive measures, don't
exercise too vigorously,
