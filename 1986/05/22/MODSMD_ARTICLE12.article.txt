# Aerobic footwear
## Put your dancing shoes on 
### 
Choosing the right aerobics
shoe can be difficult. Until
more research is done on how
the different models relate to
foot type and floor surface, no
one can say without qualifica
tion, "This is the shoe for
you." Only you know what's
best for your feet when you
perform your routines on your
floor surfaces. An aerobics
shoe that's right for you may
not be the most popular or
fashionable. Don't be swayed
by the crowd.
1. Assess your own needs.
Consider the type of floor
surface you most often dance
on, your foot type and the fre
quency and intensity of your
workouts. If you have a high
arch and do high-intensity
aerobics, put shock absorp
tion at the top of your list. If
you have flat feet and tend to
overpronate (feet turn in
ward), look for a shoe with a
high degree of stability. Too
much cushioning can increase
your tendency to roll inward.
If you have weak ankles, a
high-top shoe may provide
better support. Some shoes

accomodate orthotics better
than others. Traction must be
judged in relation to the floor
surface you dance on: A car
pet requires a smoother sole
that allows for foot glide and
pivot; a smooth floor surface
requires more tread for
greater traction.
2. Shop in a store that spe
cializes in sport shoes instead
of a discount department
store. Look at all the models to
find those that meet your
basic requirements. Avoid
shoes with narrow, curved
soles, soft leather uppers and
no supporting side straps.
3. Try on each shoe. If it
feels good, try this shoe test.
Find a floor surface in the
store that's most like your
workout surface and perform
some basic aerobic dance
movements. Run in place (to
test overall fit and comfort),
hop on one foot (to test fore
front shcok absorption), twist
from side to side with your
foot flat on the floor (to test
overall stability), roll up on the
ball of the foot (to test

flexibility), and twist on the
ball of one foot (to test
forefoot stability).
Fit and comfort. Different
shoes fit different foot types.
Be aware of arch height, inside
padding, seams that may chafe
and pressure points.
Cushion, shock absorption is
extremely important, espe
cially in the forefoot where
much of the impact in aerobic
dance occurs. The better
shoes have ethylene vinyl
acetate (EVA) or air-designed
midsoles, and some have ad
ditional forefoot plates. A
shoe can have too much cus
hion, which might feel good
when you're walking but
throw you off balance when
you work out.
2Weight. An extremely
lightweight shoe sacrifices
more important characteris
tics. Shoes that absorb shock
and provide support are more
substantial in construction
and therefore are heavier.
