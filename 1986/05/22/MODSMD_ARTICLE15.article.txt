# Vitamins and minerals
## Know your needs 
### 
Megadoses of vitamins or
minerals (doses several times
greater than the USRDA level)
are all too common, and can
be dangerous. Vitamins that
certainly should not be taken
in megadoses include A, D,
niacin, folic acid, and pantot
henic acid. Because the B
vitamins act together in the
body, megadoses of any one
can produce deficiencies of
the others. Vitamins C and B-6
in megadoses create a depen
dency state in your body, so
deficiency symptoms may ap
pear when you return to nor
mal levels.
To Be on the Safe Side ...
Some people feel better
taking supplements, even
though most doctors and
nutritionists may not think it's
necessary. A regular strength
multi-vitamin pill taken once a
day certainly won't harm you.
But it can't fully replace the

nutrients that food provides.
Vou still need to eat well.
The foods that consistently
stand out for their vitamin and
mineral content are: dark
green vegetables, whole
grains, milk, meat, and liver.
Here are a few things you can
do to make sure you are get
ting the most vitamins and
minerals out of the foods you
eat:
• Buy fresh or frozen fruits
and vegetables, rather than
canned ones. Then, avoid
long storage. A few days for
fesh produce and a month for
frozen is OK.
• Store orange juice,
tomatoes, milk and bread
away from sun or strong light.
Opaque containers are recom
mended for juice and milk.
• Choose fortified margarine
and milk, and whole grain
breads and cereals, rather
than refined ones.

• Avoid cutting vegetables
and salads ahead of time,
since vitamin C is lost through
the cut surfaces.
• Cook vegetables and meats
in as little water as possible,
and no longer than necessary.
• Reuse cooking liquids in
soups and sauces.
Who is at Risk?
You are at risk for a vitamin
or mineral deficiency if you:
• are limited in the types of
food you eat.
• eat only a small amount of

food (less than 1500 calories
per day)
• eat primarily processed
foods.
Your risk is even greater if
you fall into one of the above
categories, and you also:
• are a heavy smoker (more
than 1 1/2 packs a day.
• use birth control pills.
• drink large amounts of beer,
wine, or other alcoholic
beverages (3-4 drinks daily, or
more than that on regular oc

casions.)
What to Do
If you think you might be at
risk for a deficiency, the best
course would be to imrpove
your eating habits. In the
meantime, you may want to
get a good multivitamin pill
and take one daily. The best
choice of multivitamin is one
that meets 100 percent of the
USRDA for all 13 vitamins
(check the label). Women who
don't drink milk might also
choose to take calcium.
