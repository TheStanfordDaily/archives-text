cumulate to create major problems!
Be applying the preventive measures
listed below you can help yourself to
reduce or eliminate injuires and
"overuse syndromes" which so often
plague a runner.
Running "Do's"
•—Strengthen surrounding muscles
(the ones that aren't used much in your
sport), to prevent running injuries, and
muscle imbalance. In runners, the front
thigh muscles and the front lower leg
muscles often need strengthening.
•Work on varying surfaces, mixing
pace and direction for best overall con
ditioning. Asphalt tends to be a little
softer than concrete, and grass surfaces
should be fairly smooth and without
holes or ruts. Be careful with small in
door tracks which, after dozens of laps
can adversely affect knees and ankles.
• Powder your feet and shoes. This
will absorb moisture, reduce friction and
lessen the chance of fungus infection.
Convenient, cool and drying foot sprays
are now available.
• Wear cotton or wool socks which let
the feet breathe more easily, rather than
nylon or synthetics. Change them after
your run.
• If you have a blister or a friction
problem, use vaseline and gauze.
Wearing thick and cushioned socks de
signed for running may help prevent
blisters and add to comfort. (If it is a
water blister do not puncturee it on pur
pose. If it "pops" on its own, clean with
antiseptic solution, and leave the skin on,
as the skin acts as a protection. Then
cover with gauze and tape. Moleskin
may be placed over gauze for added
comfort. Try to assess and correct the
cause, i.e. tight shoes, foot imbalances,
etc. See your health care provider if the
problem persists.
Running "Dont's"
• Don't try to "run-off" pain. Stop and
evaluate the problem and do seek medi

cal attention.
• Don't attempt to do "too much too
soon." Build up your mileage gradually.
• Never take pills to mask pain — seek
medical attention to treat the cause of
the problem.
• Don't attempt a 100 percent work
out in the following circumstances: a)
extreme conditions of heat or humidity;
b) after a full meal; c) if you have a fever;
d) if you are just back from a lay-off or in
jury. Restoration of flexibility and muscle
strength takes time.
In Case of Injuries
Even those who religiously follow rec
ommended warm-ups and stretching
procedures can still become injured.
Injuries should be treated as soon as pos
sible after they have occurred. Use the
principles of "R.1.C.E.," which stands
for:
Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.
• Rest always helps!
• Apply crushed ice packs to the injured
area immediately after the injury has
occured. You may place ice packs di
rectly on the skin.
• Secure snugly with elastic wrap for
compression.
• Elevate the injured part above the level
of the heart.
• Remove ice pack after 20 minutes and
rewrap the injured part with elastic
bandage.
• Repeat icing procedure every 2-4
hours.
• If pain and swelling persist beyond 24-
48 hours seek medical attention. Also,
do not neglect minor injuries or try to
"play through" an injury as this can
result in further disability and a longer
lay-off as a result.
Many severe injuries such as a possi
ble fracture, tendon rupture, ankle
sprain or compartment sydrome (severe
pain in legs) or other major injury re
quires immediate emergency care!
