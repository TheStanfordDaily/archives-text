# Your aching back
## 
### 
One of the most common ailments
ever since humans assumed the upright
position has been low back pain. With
out care and concern it is not feasible for
the structures of the low back to endure
the ever increasing stress of daily living:
poor posture, lack of exercise, overeat
ing, and grueling sports.
Most low back pain is not of a serious
nature; it is the inflammation and spasm
of overexertion, minor injury, or the
normal aging process. This fact is of
small comfort, however, when confront
ing the disabling discomfort of low back
pain.
Pain occurs when specific nerve en
dings are abnormally stimulated. The
brain responds by sending messages to
muscles to go into spasm in an attempt
to immobilize and quiet the abnormally
stimulated area. Pain is the body's warn
ing of possible abuse of the structure. As
the bones, discs, ligaments and muscles
of your back are supplied by many neve
endings, there are various conditions
which cause back pain.
For Stanford students, the most com
mon causes of pain seem to be improper
preparation of supporting muscles for
activites not done on a daily basis, such
as moving furniture, intramural sports or
sensual adventure, and improper
posture during long periods of inactivity
(sitting in class or driving). A common
cause for concern of our staff are the
overloaded backpacks carelessly slung
over one shoulder. In addition, ongoing
stress, fatigue and anxiety of daily life
can increase the incidence of low back
pain.
Poor posture, lack of exercise and
overeating can be your back's worst
enemies. The proverbial "beer belly" in
creases the lumbar curve (sway back)
and weak and flabby abdominal muslcles
deprive your back of its greatest sup
port.
A basic body conditioning program
should be part of your life. It should in
clude back strengthening exercises (like
swimming, or clasical ballet) and simple
strengthening and toning exercises.
They require no special atmosphere or

equipment. In addition to regular exer
cise, prevention should include proper
body movement, warm up stretches
prior to exercise and proper support of
the back during prolonged sitting or
driving. Come to Cowell for a specific
low back exercise program.
A few tips on back care:
• When lifting: bend knees with body in
squatting position, lift object with your
legs, holding the object close to your
body centered in front of you. Feel the
strength of pull in thighs, buttocks and
arms. Only lift objects chest high.
• Be sure of footing and plan ahead to
get help when moving furniture, books,
boxes, etc.
• Make an effort to use available equip
ment such as hand trucks or luggage car
riers to minimize strain as you move
heavy objects.
• Move car seat forward and keep knees
bent while driving long distances. Stop
frequently and stretch.
• When standing for prolonged periods
use a foot stool to relieve stress on the
lower back. (Examples: while ironing or
doing dishes stand with one foot on
stool and change frequently to alternate
foot).
• Do warm-up exercises which include
stretching of the abdomen, buttocks,
hamstrings and lower back prior to
strenuous activity.
• When back pain or spasm occurs; im
mediately stop all lifting, or other activi
ties which aggravate the pain. Lie flat on
the floor or a firm bed to relieve the
pain. Sleep on a firm mattress. Sleep on
your back with a small pillow under the
knees.
Come to Cowell if:
• Pain radiates to the buttocks or legs or
if you have numbness or tingling in
these areas.
• Pain is not relieved by aspirin and rest.
• Any new symptoms occur in people
with long-term back problems.
If students have back problems or
want more information about back care,
the Cowell staff should be consulted by
phone or appointment. Handouts which
detail back care are available on request.
