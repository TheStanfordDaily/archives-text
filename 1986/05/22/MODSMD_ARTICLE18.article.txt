Some Staff at Cowell
... answering "What
do you do to maintain
your fitness?"


"I like to dance, walk
on the beach, try new
things, and am trying to
develop my sense of
humor by laughing more
frequently.
Ana Cupp, R.N.
nurse practitioner


"To maintain my
physical and emotional
balance I exercise,
renovate my home, and
chew gum but never at
the same time!"
Kathy Seabrooke, R.N.
outpatient nurse


"I keep physically fit by
biking to work, running
and swimming often, and
by eating the right foods.
I keep mentally fit by not
worrying about the times
I eat jurik now and then
or lay around for a day.
Mia Clark, R.D., M.P.H.
nutrition educator

between the eleven
aerobics classes that I
teach every week."

3 times a week I run 4Vi
miles with a group of guys
from our church at 6:15 AM.
We also pray while we're
running, which helps keep
us in shape both ways.
John Dorman, M.D.
Associate Director


"I maintain both my
physical and mental well
being by involvement in a
variety of different
activities. I have my own
video production
company and I also act in
both film and theatre.
If those activities do
not relax me, I perform
neuro-surgury."
Lou Shaw, R.N.
outpatient nursing staff



"I work hard every day
I don't drink.
I don't smoke.
I don't eat excessively.
I live a very healthy,
boring life."
