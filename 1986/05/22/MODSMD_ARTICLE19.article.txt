# How you can reduce cancer risks
## Cancer related checkups 
### 
Women:
Breast — see adjacent article
Cervix — Current recommen
dations by the American Can
cer Society (ACS) are for two
initial Pap tests 1 year apart. If
these are normal, at least
every three years subse
quently. Those with early age
at first intercourse, herpes or
multiple sexual partners are at
higher risk. These recommen
dations are controversial; the
American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology
still feels that annual Pap tests
are indicated.

DES — women whose mother
took DES (diethyl stilbesterol)
while they were in utero have
an increased susceptability to
an unusual type of vaginal can
cer. Opinions differs as to
how these women should be
monitored — they probably
should at least be seen an
nually be a gynecologist.
Men:
Testicular cancer — Current
recommendations of the ACS
are for men to do regular self
examination to check for
lumps or nodules.
Both Men and Women:

Thyroid — students who have
had radiation therapy to the
head and neck (not diagnostic
x-rays) may be at increased
risk of thryoid cancer. If you
have such a history, confer
with a doctor.
Skin — There are several dif
ferent kinds of skin cancer.
Fair-skinned individuals are at
higher risk. Most common in
this age group is: Melanoma —
a malignant mole. Any mole
which gets darker or starts
spreading into surounding
tissue is suspect. Increased
sun time increases risk of skin
cancer.
