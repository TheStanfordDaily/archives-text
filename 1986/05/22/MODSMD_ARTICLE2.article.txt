# Graduation
## Not just a celebration 
### 
Students in their last year at
Stanford look towards gradua
tion with great anticipation.
What as a first-year student
had been a distant goal, is
rapidly becoming a June 1986
reality. The innumerable term
papers, lab exercises, mid
terms and finals may fast
become past memories. The
all-nighter stints, the lonely
late evening walks to Meyer
and Green Libraries, and the
untold self-sacrifices will fi
nally be acknowledged.
This is cause for celebration
and, indeed, many who are
graduating are presently busy
preparing for such a celebra
tion on graduation day. But
joy may not be the only emo
tion felt by graduating stu
dents. A certain degree of
anxiety is also generated as
commencement approaches.
Most students are aware
that while graduation will
bring many long-awaited

benefits, leaving Stanford also
means having to find a new
niche for oneself amid un
familiar places and people.
When students leave, they are
leaving a network of close
friends, familiar places and
routines. Thus, it is not unus
ual to also experience some
"anticipatory loss."
In anticipating leaving the
familiarity of Stanford, stu
dents often begin the
"disconnecting" process
early. This can include
withdrawing from friends so
as not to get too close before
leaving, giving less attention
to coursework, and develop
ing a condescending attitude
toward students still excited
about Stanford.
There may be a great deal of
looking back, some depres
sion or anger, and a tendency
to idealize the experience at
the University. The greater the
involvement in the academic,

social and extracurricular life,
the greater the sense of loss.
The goals of academic
achievement have provided so
much focus in one's life, that
when the goal is achieved, the
focus can be lost.
The intensity of the anxiety
and sadness associated with
leaving Stanford will depend
on individual personality char
acteristics and external cir
cumstances. Obviously, if the
student is continuing with an
other degree at Stanford, is
staying in the general vicinity
or going "home," the level of
anxiety and sense of loss may
be minimal. If, on the other
hand, the student is going to a
new place (even if perceived
as desirable) where she or he
will have to deal with accep
tance by a new group of peers
and learning the rules of the
new environment, the level of
anxiety may be greater.
