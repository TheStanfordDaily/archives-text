# Testicular self-exam
## 
### 
Cancer of the testes, the
male reproductive glands, is
one of the most common can
cers for men 15 to 34 years of
age. It accounts for 12 percent
of all cancer deaths in this
group.
Testicular cancer, in the
early stages, can be treated
promptly and effectively. The
most common type,
seminoma, has a survival rate
approaching 100 percent in
cases detected and treated
early.
The first sign of testicular
cancer is usually a slight en
largement of one of the testes,
and a change in its consis
tency. Pain may be absent, but

often there is a dull ache in the
lower abdomen and groin,
along with a sensation of drag
ging and heaviness,
yi A simple monthly self
examination is the best
method for early detection.
The best time is after a warm
bath or shower, when the
scrotal skin is most relaxed.yr
Roll each testicle gently be
tween the thumb and fingers
of both hands. If you find any
hard lumps or nodules, see
your doctor promptly. The
lumps may not be malignant,
but only your doctor can make
the diagnosis.
