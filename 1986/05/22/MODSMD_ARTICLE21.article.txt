# Understand the Pap test
## 
### 
The Papanicolou smear (Pap smear or
Pap test), a simple and painless proce
dure, is the most common screening test
for cervical cancer. Using a swab and/or
stick, the practitioner scrapes cells off of
the cervix during a pelvic examination
and applies them to a glass slide, where
they are preserved and reviewed by a
cytologist.
Abnormal Pap tests are quite com
mon. About 25 Pap tests a week are done
at Cowell and approximately 10-15% of
these are not normal, indicating the
cytology lab cannot say for sure that
there are no cancer cells present.
Remember that the Pap test is a
screening test; it does not give definitive
information. The vast majority of abnor
mal Pap tests, when repeated in three to
six months, show a return to normal.
Much of the time a vaginitis or cervicitis
has caused enough inflammation and a
distortion of the cells that they cytologist
can't tell if they are normal. In such a
case, when the test is repeated after the
inflammation has been treated or
subsided, the Pap usually appears nor

mal again.
If a Pap test is quite abnormal or if a
mild abnormality persists for a long time,
usualy a culposcopy is recommended.
The culposcope is like an operating mi
croscope which allows the gynecologist
to view the cervix under high power. If
an area looks particularly abnormal, the
physician will then take a biopsy of the
area (not just a scraping but actual
tissue). Only if the biopsy is clearly ab
normal will any diagnosis of cancer be
considered.
However, the sensitivity of the Pap test
is such that even at this stage, abnor
malities revealed in the biopsy can
usually be cured, either by cryosurgery
(freezing) or by cone biopsy (a larger
portion of the cervix is removed). There
are no long-term side effects from these
procedures.
When a Pap report comes back with an
abnormal finding, many women feel a
hysterectomy is the next step. That is
simply not true. An abnormal Pap is a
cause for attention and concern, but
need not be regarded as catastrophic.
