# Breast self-exams
## 
### 
The breasts are the foremost site of
cancer deaths in women, and one in 11
women will develop breast cancer.
Although the statistics are frightening,
the situation is far from hopeless. If the
cancer is discovered in its early, lo
calized stage before it has spread
beyond the breast, most breast cancer
patients will survive and live normal,
productive lives. Almost 85 percent of all
women who discover breast cancer early
and are treated promptly recover.
Ninety-five percent of breast cancer is
discovered by the women themselves.
Breast self-exams should be done once a
month, at the end of the menstrual per
iod. This is the time when the cyclical
hormonal stimulation of the breast has
subsided. When the breast self-exam is
done regularly, you will know what your
breasts feel like and thus will be better
able to detect change. The monthly self

exam should be supplemented by an an
nual check-up with a physician.
If you detect a lump during a
self-exam, call for an appointment with
your doctor immediately. Vou should
keep in mind the fact that 80 percent of
all lumps discovered in the breasts are
benign.
It is also important to know your fam
ily history, as this will determine your
risk for breast cancer. For example, if
your mother or sister had breast cancer
before menopause and in both breasts,
your risk will be almost nine times
greater than a woman who has no family
history of cancer. If your family history
shows a case of breast cancer after
menopause and in only one breast, the
risk is slightly greater than that of a
woman with no family history of the
disease. Your doctor can advise you
whether you have a higher than average
risk for breast cancer.
