With spring and the arrival of
warm weather, the care of
one's skin is foremost in the
minds of many. Here is an
overview of several common
concerns of skin treatment:
The most damaging influ
ence on the skin over which
we have some control is the
ultraviolet component of sun
light. Along with genetic and
(perhaps) other environmen
tal factors, sunlight plays a
major role in producing both
cancer of the skin and the con
stellation of changes we see as
"aging" of the skin. Since the
melanin pigment produced by
the skin is probably its prin
cipal means of protection
against ultraviolet light, the
less pigmented individual (the

lighter skinned person) is at
greatest risk. In fact, the com
monest type of skin cancer,
the basal cell carcinoma, is
greatest in those with blue
eyes and/or light skin. Al
though this form of skin can
cer has little or no potential
for internal spread, it can be
locally destructive and re
quires surgical removal. It can
appear in individuals with
heavy sun exposure as early as
the mid-20s or 30s.
Sunscreens
The efficiency of sunscreens
is currently rated with a sun
protection factor (SPF) num
ber. In general, the higher the
number, the more efficient
the sunscreen. Since they
rarely prove as efficient in

field testing as their labels in
dicate, those with a SPF of 15
should be preferred. Those
available in cream or
"moisturizing lotion" bases
remain effective longer after
applications — even during
periods of swimming — but
may aggravate acne or sebon
heir dermatitis if those condi
tions are also a problem.
Occasionally hypersensitivity
to PABA sunscreens may oc
cur, in which case benzop
henone sunscreens can be
used.
Moles
With regard to skin cancer
some mention should be
made of pigmented lesions or
"moles." Although the vast
