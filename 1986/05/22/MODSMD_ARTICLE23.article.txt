# Preventive dermatology:
## From head to toe 
### 
With spring and the arrival of
warm weather, the care of
one's skin is foremost in the
minds of many. Here is an
overview of several common
concerns of skin treatment:
The most damaging influ
ence on the skin over which
we have some control is the
ultraviolet component of sun
light. Along with genetic and
(perhaps) other environmen
tal factors, sunlight plays a
major role in producing both
cancer of the skin and the con
stellation of changes we see as
"aging" of the skin. Since the
melanin pigment produced by
the skin is probably its prin
cipal means of protection
against ultraviolet light, the
less pigmented individual (the

lighter skinned person) is at
greatest risk. In fact, the com
monest type of skin cancer,
the basal cell carcinoma, is
greatest in those with blue
eyes and/or light skin. Al
though this form of skin can
cer has little or no potential
for internal spread, it can be
locally destructive and re
quires surgical removal. It can
appear in individuals with
heavy sun exposure as early as
the mid-20s or 30s.
Sunscreens
The efficiency of sunscreens
is currently rated with a sun
protection factor (SPF) num
ber. In general, the higher the
number, the more efficient
the sunscreen. Since they
rarely prove as efficient in

field testing as their labels in
dicate, those with a SPF of 15
should be preferred. Those
available in cream or
"moisturizing lotion" bases
remain effective longer after
applications — even during
periods of swimming — but
may aggravate acne or sebon
heir dermatitis if those condi
tions are also a problem.
Occasionally hypersensitivity
to PABA sunscreens may oc
cur, in which case benzop
henone sunscreens can be
used.
Moles
With regard to skin cancer
some mention should be
made of pigmented lesions or
"moles." Although the vast
majority of moles are harm
less, the incidence of malig
ment melanoma has been
steadily increasing for the past
few decades. Although more
people are exposing their skin
to sunlight than in the past this
may not be the only reason.
What is of greatest practical
importance is that the com
monest form of this poten
tially lethal skin cancer may
often be recognized early in
its development. Surgical
removal at this stage, often
with a simple conservative ap
proach, may provide a com
plete cure for a lesion that five
or ten years later may have
been fatal. (Consequently any
mole which exhibits unusal
changes in color, size, shape
or surface texture should
prompt medical consultation.)
Seeking attention for such a
lesion is the single most im
portant instance of
"preventive dermatology."
Itchy Skin
One of the commonest
complaints heard by the der
matologist is that of dry itchy
skin. This may particularly be a
problem for those who
shower or bathe more than
once daily or those with a
fondness for the long,
leisurely, hot shower or bath.
A simple remedy is general
found with briefer bathing fol
lowed by simple lotion or
cream. Lotions or creams con
taining urea or lactic acid may
be helpful in more stubborn
cases and are available with
out prescription.
Dermatitis

"Dermatitis" is a term ap
plied to a particular pattern of
inflammation of the superficial
portion of the skin. There are
several types of dermatitis
with various causes. Contact
dermatitis is one of the com
monest forms. It may be
caused by direct chemical irri
tation ("irritant dermatitis")
from such substances as
soaps, detergents, fabric sof
teners or solvents. It also may
be the result of acquired aller
gic hypersensitivity ("allergic
contact dermatitis") to such
things as poison oak resin,
nickel (in jewelry, etc.),
perfumes (in scents, anti
perspirants or hair sprays,
after-shave lotions) or hair
dyes. Contact dermatitis is not
contagious and will appear
only at points of contact.
Treatment is directed at elim
inating the cause (e.g. through
bathing and washing of con
taminated clothing, pets or
other articles after poison oak
exposure) and suppression of
the dermatitis with cortisone
preparations.
The cortisone creams
available without a prescrip
tion are generally too weak to
benefit any but the mildest
dermatitis but similarly
available antihistamines taken
at bedtime may help relieve
the itching and facilitate sleep.
Many creams and lotions sold
for controlling itching contain
benzocaine which is of doubt
ful efficacy, may itself produce
allergic contact dermatitis and
should be avoided.
Acne

It has been said that al
though acne does not
threaten life it certainly can at
least spoil it a little. Many
diverse factors may aggravate
it including a strong family his
tory, physical exposure to
grease and oil (e.g. in machine
or cooking oil, oil-based cos
metics, etc.), certain drugs
(including iodine containing
kelp or seaweed tablets and
certain of the birth control
pills), menstrual periods or
stress. It is currently fas
hionable in dermatology
circles to doubt the relation
ship of diet to acne. Oc
casional individuals, however,
do seem to consistently flare
following indulgence in some
of the traditionally forbidden
foods, and particularly choco
late. The essential cause
remains unknown and in most
cases no clear single cause can
be identified. It is certainly
desirable to gently cleanse the
skin of dirt, debris and oil and
although some prefer a mildly
abrasive soap or cleansing
pad, there is no evidence that
they accomplish more than a
simple mild soap. The only
products available without
prescription that are of
demonstratable benefit are
the benzoyl peroxide prepara
tions. They are available in
strengths of 2Vi%, 5% and 10%
and since they may be irritat
ing the lower concentrations
should be tried first. They are
also incorporated into liquid
soaps or "washes" which are
particularly useful for treating
involvment of the chest and
back.

number, the more efficient
the sunscreen. Since they
rarely prove as efficient in

field testing as their labels in
dicate, those with a SPF of 15
should be preferred. Those
available in cream or
"moisturizing lotion" bases
remain effective longer after
applications — even during
periods of swimming — but
may aggravate acne or sebon
heir dermatitis if those condi
tions are also a problem.
Occasionally hypersensitivity
to PABA sunscreens may oc
cur, in which case benzop
henone sunscreens can be
used.
Moles
With regard to skin cancer
some mention should be
made of pigmented lesions or
"moles." Although the vast
majority of moles are harm
less, the incidence of malig
ment melanoma has been
steadily increasing for the past
few decades. Although more
people are exposing their skin
to sunlight than in the past this
may not be the only reason.
What is of greatest practical
importance is that the com
monest form of this poten
tially lethal skin cancer may
often be recognized early in
its development. Surgical
removal at this stage, often
with a simple conservative ap
proach, may provide a com
plete cure for a lesion that five
or ten years later may have
been fatal. (Consequently any
mole which exhibits unusal
changes in color, size, shape
or surface texture should
prompt medical consultation.)
Seeking attention for such a
lesion is the single most im
portant instance of
"preventive dermatology."
Itchy Skin
One of the commonest
complaints heard by the der
matologist is that of dry itchy
skin. This may particularly be a
problem for those who
shower or bathe more than
once daily or those with a
fondness for the long,
leisurely, hot shower or bath.
A simple remedy is general
found with briefer bathing fol
lowed by simple lotion or
cream. Lotions or creams con
taining urea or lactic acid may
be helpful in more stubborn
cases and are available with
out prescription.
Dermatitis

"Dermatitis" is a term ap
plied to a particular pattern of
inflammation of the superficial
portion of the skin. There are
several types of dermatitis
with various causes. Contact
dermatitis is one of the com
monest forms. It may be
caused by direct chemical irri
tation ("irritant dermatitis")
from such substances as
soaps, detergents, fabric sof
teners or solvents. It also may
be the result of acquired aller
gic hypersensitivity ("allergic
contact dermatitis") to such
things as poison oak resin,
nickel (in jewelry, etc.),
perfumes (in scents, anti
perspirants or hair sprays,
after-shave lotions) or hair
dyes. Contact dermatitis is not
contagious and will appear
only at points of contact.
Treatment is directed at elim
inating the cause (e.g. through
bathing and washing of con
taminated clothing, pets or
other articles after poison oak
exposure) and suppression of
the dermatitis with cortisone
preparations.
The cortisone creams
available without a prescrip
tion are generally too weak to
benefit any but the mildest
dermatitis but similarly
available antihistamines taken
at bedtime may help relieve
the itching and facilitate sleep.
Many creams and lotions sold
for controlling itching contain
benzocaine which is of doubt
ful efficacy, may itself produce
allergic contact dermatitis and
should be avoided.
Acne

It has been said that al
though acne does not
threaten life it certainly can at
least spoil it a little. Many
diverse factors may aggravate
it including a strong family his
tory, physical exposure to
grease and oil (e.g. in machine
or cooking oil, oil-based cos
metics, etc.), certain drugs
(including iodine containing
kelp or seaweed tablets and
certain of the birth control
pills), menstrual periods or
stress. It is currently fas
hionable in dermatology
circles to doubt the relation
ship of diet to acne. Oc
casional individuals, however,
do seem to consistently flare
following indulgence in some
of the traditionally forbidden
foods, and particularly choco
late. The essential cause
remains unknown and in most
cases no clear single cause can
be identified. It is certainly
desirable to gently cleanse the
skin of dirt, debris and oil and
although some prefer a mildly
abrasive soap or cleansing
pad, there is no evidence that
they accomplish more than a
simple mild soap. The only
products available without
prescription that are of
demonstratable benefit are
the benzoyl peroxide prepara
tions. They are available in
strengths of 2Vi%, 5% and 10%
and since they may be irritat
ing the lower concentrations
should be tried first. They are
also incorporated into liquid
soaps or "washes" which are
particularly useful for treating
involvment of the chest and
back.
With spring and the arrival of
warm weather, the care of
one's skin is foremost in the
minds of many. Here is an
overview of several common
concerns of skin treatment:
The most damaging influ
ence on the skin over which
we have some control is the
ultraviolet component of sun
light. Along with genetic and
(perhaps) other environmen
tal factors, sunlight plays a
major role in producing both
cancer of the skin and the con
stellation of changes we see as
"aging" of the skin. Since the
melanin pigment produced by
the skin is probably its prin
cipal means of protection
against ultraviolet light, the
less pigmented individual (the

lighter skinned person) is at
greatest risk. In fact, the com
monest type of skin cancer,
the basal cell carcinoma, is
greatest in those with blue
eyes and/or light skin. Al
though this form of skin can
cer has little or no potential
for internal spread, it can be
locally destructive and re
quires surgical removal. It can
appear in individuals with
heavy sun exposure as early as
the mid-20s or 30s.
Sunscreens
The efficiency of sunscreens
is currently rated with a sun
protection factor (SPF) num
ber. In general, the higher the
