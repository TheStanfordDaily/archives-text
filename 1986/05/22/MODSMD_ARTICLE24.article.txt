# How alcohol works
## 
### 
Alcohol is a mood-altering
drug. It is not digested, but
passes through the walls of the
stomach and small intestine
directly into the bloodstream.
The liver metabolizes alcohol
at the rate of about three
quarters of an ounce per hour.
Any alcohol in excess of what
the liver can process spills into
the blood stream and circu
lates into the entire body, af
fecting the brain and central
nervous system.
Alcohol puts the brain to
sleep by progressively sedat
ing various brain functions.
Drinkers know the sensation,
after a drink or two, of feeling
looser and more relaxed in a

social situation. This lessening
of inhibitions is the effect of
alcohol on the cerebral cortex.
The sensory system is dulled,
and then muscular coordina
tion goes, causing those who
are intoxicated to stumble and
slur their words. The last area
of the brain to be affected is
the medulla, which controls
heart beat and respiration.
When alcohol concentration
becomes high enough to sig
nificantly affect the medulla,
respiration becomes impaired
and cerebral function may be
so depressed that the person
passes out. Although unusual,
death can occur from too
much alcohol consumed too
fast.
