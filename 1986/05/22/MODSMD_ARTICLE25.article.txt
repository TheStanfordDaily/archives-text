There are several ways stu
dents attempt to cope with the
expected disruption of their
social and spatial continuity.
Some cope by extending their
experience, perhaps by
staying in the general vicinity.
Others go "home" for the
summer to be among relatives
and old friends. Still others
commit to non-student roles
that have greater potential for
continuity, such as making the
decision to get married.
Whatever specific strategy
students take to deal with the
anxiety associated with
"leaving" Stanford, there are
factors that contribute to a
good adjustment while others

do not. Advance planning, ac
tive exploration of reality issues,
and free expression of both pos
itive and negative feelings seem
to aid a good adjustment.
Flexibility and willingness to
tolerate frustration, and support
from family and friends regard
ing decisions also assist the
transition. However, the lack
of support by family and
friends of post-college plans,
impulsive choices, lack of
preparation, and unrealistic
expectations may all contrib
ute to a poor adjustment.
For most students the leave
taking is bittersweet.
Relinquishing the familiarity of
Stanford is aided by the move
onto new plans, goals and ex
pectations.
