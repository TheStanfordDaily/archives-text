# What to know About Cystitis
## 
### 
Bladder infections rarely
strike men, but are common
in women. Cystitis occurs
when foreign bacteria enter
(he bladder by way of the
urethra, or less commonly, by
descending from the kidney.
Once in the hospitable envi
ronment of the bladder, bac
teria flourish, and urinary
symptoms arise without warn
ing.
Sexual intercourse is most
often the culprit, particularly if
the woman's vaginal opening
is small. During intercourse,
the penis sometimes pushes
external bacteria into the
woman's urethra. Inflamma
tion of the bladder, called cys
titits, usually starts about 36
hours afterward.
Symptoms of cystitis include
frequent and painful urina
tion. In some cases, blood ap
pears in the urine. If the
kidney is involved, a woman
may experience chills, fever,
and back pain.
Cystitis is diagnosed when
an examination of a urine
sample under the microscope
reveals the presence of bac
teria and white blood cells.
The physician usually prepares
a urine culture to find out
which bacteria caused the in
fection, and to determine

which antibiotic will be most
effective in treating it.
Treatment for cystitis con
sists of antibiotics and in
creased fluid intake.
Sometimes a urinary anes
thetic will also be given.
Acute cystitis can be
avoided by taking a few simple
precautions. Never delay
urination when the urge
begins, which usually means
urinating every two hours or
so during waking hours.
Drinking eight glasses of water
daily. Wipe from front to rear
after going to the bathroom.
Assure adequate lubrication,
either natural mucous or a lu
bricant, during intercourse.
Some urologists suggest
that, as an added precaution,
showers be substituted for tub
baths (especially bubble
baths) to further reduce the
incidence of bladder infec
tions among susceptible
women.
When you're being treated
for cystitis it's important that
you take all your prescribed
medication even after
symptoms disappear. It is
equally important that your
urine be rechecked following
treatment to be sure the infec
tion has been cleared.
