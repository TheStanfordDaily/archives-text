## Traveler's diarrhea Don't spoil your vacation 
### 
People don't like to talk
about it, but traveler's diar
rhea is a common problem for
first-time tourists overseas.
Here's a description of the ill
ness and some possible treat
ments:
Most cases of traveler's
diarrhea are probably caused
by "enteropathogenic E coli"
â€” E coli bacteria that cause
disease in the intenstines. The
most important aspect of pre
vention is remembering that
the diarrhea occurs mostly
from "fecal-oral" transmis
sions. In the Peace Corps, vol
unteers are told to "boil it,
cook it, peel it, or forget it."
Fresh salads and ice (unless
made from boiled water)
should be bypassed. Cooked
food should be eaten while
still hot. Bottled drinks or OK.
In addition several medica
tions have been used to either
prevent or treat the problem:
Bismuth subsalicylate
(Pepto Bismol) is a cheap,
over-the-counter preparation
that seems uniquely effective
in preventing traveler's diar
rhea, as well as in its treat
ment. If used preventively, the
liquid has been studied and
found effective, but in fairly
high doses: 1/4 cup four times
a day! This volume would be 3
1/2 pints for a weeks vacation!
Others have recommended
the more portable tablets, at
one or two a day, but the

tablets have not been studied,
nor has the lower dose.
Pepto-Bismol can also be
used only if symptoms occur;
in this case, follow instruc
tions on the bottle.
Loperamide (Immodium) is
a medicine similar to lomotil
which appears to be effective
without the side effect of
prolonging the illness.
Antibiotics have also been
used, both preventively
(prophylactically) and
therapeutically (only if
symptoms). The main argu
ment against preventative an
tibiotics is a public health one:
indiscriminate use of an
tibiotics will promote the
emergence of antibiotic
resistant bacteria.
Doxycline (Vibramycin) a
relative of tetracycline, was
the first drug used
preventively. One pill a day
has been found to be effec
tive. The main disadvantages
are cost ($.60 - $.80/ pill or
higher) and increased sun sen
sitivity in those who take it. If
taken as treatment only (for
symptoms), doxycycline is
taken twice daily.
Regular tetracycline is much
less expensive, but has not
been studied. It also must be
taken four times/day where
doxycyline is effective only 2
times per day. Sun sensitivity
again may be a problem.

Trimethoprim
sulfamethoxazole (Septra DS,
Bactrim DS) has been used
both preventively (once a day)
and therapeutically (twice a
day) for treatment of the prob
lem. Those who are allergic to
sulfa should not use this
regimen; trimethoprim alone
(200 mg.) is also effective as
treatment when taken twice
daily.
Less desirable treatments
Diphenoxylate
HCI /Atropine (Lomotil) has
been used widely for diarrhea
in the past. Though quite ef
fective, studies have shown
that this drug may prolong the
illness; when the drug is
stopped, diarrhea may return.
Enterovioform is available
over-the-counter for diarrhea
in Mexico. Although some
what effective against amoebic
dysentery, it is not particulalry
effective against enteropat
hogenic E coli and may have
side effects.
Not all traveler's diarrhea
responds to these measures.
Amoeba, giardia, and other
parasites are not treated by
the above antibiotics. Some
bacterial infections
(salmonella, shigella, cholera)
may not be prevented. Diar
rhea which persists, becomes
severe, or is associated with
bleeding or high fever should
be evaluated medically.
