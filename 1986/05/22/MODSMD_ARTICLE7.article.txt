What Is Aerobic Exercise,
Anyway?
Aerobic exercise (jogging,
swimming, aerobic dancing,
cycling, rope jumping, etc.) is
sustained exercise that re
quires both the use of large
muscles and a constant supply
of oxygen.
Activities requiring short, sud
den bursts of energy like
sprinting or weight lifting are
termed anaerobic (without
oxygen). These are not effec
tive in increasing your car
diovascular fitness (though
they do have other benefits!).
What's So Great About
Aerobic Exercise?
Some of the most striking

benefits are:
• A greater sense of well
being.
• Increased stamina.
• Better sleep.
• Less fatigue.
• Increased efficiency and
strength of heart, lungs and
muscles.
• Improved appearance with a
decrease in body fat
percentage.
• Improved sugar
metabolism.
• Decreased risk of heart
disease.
• Decreased blood pressure.
• Improved endurance.
• Less stress.
• Less bone and joint disor-
ders.
