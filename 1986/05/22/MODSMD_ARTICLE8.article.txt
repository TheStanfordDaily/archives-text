# Stretch against injury

### 
Stretching exercises make
everyday movement easier
and can help you prevent in
jury and soreness from your
exercise.
Always begin your workout
with 8-10 minutes of stretch
ing, followed by some easy
aerobic work for 2-5 minutes.
At this point you can increase
the speed and intensity. This
preliminary warmup:
• gets fluid to the joints to
keep them lubricated to
facilitate exercise
• increases blood circulation
of the muscles
• gets the cardiovascular sys
tem warmed up
• gets the body ready for
vigorous exercise
Cooling down is also essen
tial and you should never ne
glect it. After the vigorous part
of your workout, slow down
by brisk walking or by swim
ming slowly for 3-5 minutes
and then stretch again for 5-10
minutes. Doing so:
• gives the body a chance to
recover from vigorous exer
cise
• stretches muscles that
tighten during aerobic activi

ties
• helps prevent soreness and
cramping by maintaining cir
culation to muscles and thus
aiding in the removal of waste
products
To improve and sustain
flexibility, there are several
steps to take:
Stretch in your daily activi
ties. Vou can stretch your
neck, shoulders, or legs while
studying, driving or sitting.
Do stretching exercises to
improve flexibility in specific
muscle areas. By targeting cer
tain muscles with daily stretch
ing exercises, their flexibility
can be improved by holding a
stretch for 20 to 30 seconds
three times in succession.
Always remember that it is
important to stretch before
and after exercise. Aerobic ex

ercises involve the repeated
contraction of the muscles
used. Contraction is just the
opposite of stretching so con
scious attempts to stretch are
needed to maintain flexibility.
There Is A Difference Be
tween Stretching and
Toning Exercises
• Toning exercises are for
strength and consist of
repeated contraction
(shortening) of certain
muscles. Examples are push
ups, leg-lifts, sit-ups.
• Stretching exercises are
for flexibility and consist of
constant stretching
(lengthening) of certain
muscles. Examples are toe
touches, side-bends, neck
rotations.
