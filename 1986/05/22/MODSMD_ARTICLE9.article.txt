Can You Change Your Body
Composition?
Regardless of how drasti
cally you might like to change
your body composition, re
member that only moderate
changes in your lifestyle will
lead to permanent body fat
loss (or gain). Fad diets are not
a good way to lose body fat.
They are not only dangerous
but also ineffective because
the faster you drop those
pounds, the more likely you
are to put them right back on.
Cutting the caloric equivalent
of one piece of lightly buttered
bread (approx 100 cal) per day
from your diet can drop about
10 pounds over a year. Aerobic
exercise for about 10 minutes at
Target Heart Rate daily will
have the same results. This
means that changing your habits
even to this small degree will
add up to a change in fat
percentage over time. And,
since these changes are small
and thus more likely to be per
manent, this body fat will stay
off!
When Your Body Fat
Percentage Is High:
Incorporating more aerobic
exercise into your lifestyle is

the best way to reduce your
body's fat content. Obviously,
jogging isn't the only way to
do this. Brisk walking, swim
ming, cycling, aerobic danc
ing, of any other aerobic
exercise is just as effective at
reducing body fat.
Here's Why Exercise Is So Effec
tive:
Weight is lost when calories
burned are greater than
calories consumed. You burn
approximately 100 calores for
every 10 minutes of aerobic
exercise at Target Heart Rate
and your rate of burning
calories may also be slightly
elevated for up to 15 hours
after an exercise session.
Exercise develops muscles
and decreases fat. Fat is in
active tissue — it just sits
there. Muscle is active — it
burns calories all the time so
your metabolism increases as
your muscle mass increases.
In a study done at the Stan
ford Heart Disease Prevention
Program, runners were found
to eat more and weigh less
than non-runners. This means
that with exercise, you can
maintain your present food
intake and still lose body fat!
