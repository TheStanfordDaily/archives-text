My life with
Rob Graham, Part I
STILLWATER, Okla. —
The mosquitos were out in full
force today, boy. Why, they ate
right through my Hawaiian
shirt! After that, it was time to
make dinner reservations.
But seriously, folks, life is
dull out here in cattle country.
The meat is good, sure, but it's
nothing like I can get back on
the Farm — if you know what I
mean. Let's face it, Stillwater
ain't La Jolla.
But to get back to the basics,
to get down to brass tacks —
today sure was a scorcher. I
mean, you could've fried an egg
on home plate! But Card skip
per Mark Marquess' forehead
would done just as well. A pop
up to shortstop — a can of
corn! Con of corn! And he
drops it!
