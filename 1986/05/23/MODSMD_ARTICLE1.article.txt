# Mars mission planned

In the next decade, researchers
from Stanford, N ASA and the French
Space Agency will conduct a major
experiment to explore the atmo
sphere and gravitational field of the
planet Mars from an unmanned U.S.
orbiting spacecraft.
The spacecraft, called Mars Obser
ver Mission (MOM), is scheduled to
be launched in August 1990, either
on a space shuttle or an expendable
rocket, according to G. Leonard
Tyler, a research professor of electri
cal engineering here who is radiosci
ence team leader for the mission.
Tyler is hopeful that recent
tragedies at NASA, such as the ex
plosion of the space shuttle Chal
lenger that killed its seven crew mem
bers, "won t affect (the mission) at
all."
"MOM was the only experiment on
(NASA's schedule) whose date
wasn't slipped," he said, adding that
by 1990 NASA "expects to recover
and get back on schedule."
MOM is the first of a series of low
cost satellites that essentially use
existing hardware. It is a modified
version of SATCOM, a communica
tions satellite built by RCA.
Unlike the Viking programs that
sent spacecraft to Mars with
"unlimited costs," Tyler said MOM is
different because "from its concep
tion, (we have) been concerned with
how to do this in the most economical
way." MOM is being developed
"partly just to prove it can be done"
under the existing budget constraints,
he explained.
"We are going to get into orbit
(about a year after the launch) and
watch the seasons change on Mars
and try to understand what is going
on," Tyler said.
The technique for the analysis of
the atmosphere is called radio oc
cultation. Radio signals will be sent to
earth from the spacecraft. As they
pass behind the planet, the signals
will be altered by the Martian atmos
phere. These changes will provide in
formation about the atmosphere of
Mai's via earth-based computers.
Occultations will be produced
every 45 minutes and will be ob
served eight hours a day. By the time
the experiment is over, the team will
have as many as 4,000 profiles of the
atmosphere.
Currently Tyler is working on
"how to mechanize (this) huge collec
tion of data." To illustrate the enor
mity of the work, Tyler explained that
it took two years of preparation on
the Voyager to get a single occulta
tion from Uranus.
Unlike most other NASA
planetary explorations, where the
data was accumulated in a brief
burst as a spacecraft sailed by, MOM
will mean two years of data coming in
on a daily basis.
The frequency of the occultations
will produce data "equal to that
