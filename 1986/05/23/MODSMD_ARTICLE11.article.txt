U.S. media operates under "a
commercial control" that distin
guishes it from the "Eastern
European socialist countries and
the Soviet Union, (where) there is
a government control," Andras
Kepes, deputy editor in chief of
Hungarian Television, said last
night in a panel discussion on the
media and its effect on U.S. per
ceptions of world events.
The discussion, held in Arroyo
Lounge, also featured Anwomea-
Ackah Blay, assistant editor of
Ghana Broadcasting Corp.,
Colette Braeckman, international
journalist for the Brussels newspa
per le Soir, and Linda Herskowitz,
medical writer for The Philadel
phia Inquirer.
Kepes' statement summed up
his belief that U.S. media institu
tions are business corporations
and must cover news events inter
esting to the public in order to
show a profit. The question of

gearing news coverage to public
interest for monetary reasons was
raised from the floor and became a
central focus of the discussion. All
of the speakers agreed with Kepes
to some extent on this point, but
Blay said U.S. news coverage is
also dictated by the government.
"President Reagan said, 'We
have irrefutable evidence that
Libya is responsible for ter
rorism,' " Blay said, using the
bombing of Libya as an example
for his theory, "and papers started
singing the same song: that the
evidence was irrefutable."
The four panelists agreed that
U.S. coverage of international
events is inadequate.
"We're just interested in what
threatens us," Herskowitz said
about the U.S. media, but Kepes
opened the discussion with a
similar comment when he said the
average Soviet citizen reads the in
ternational sections of the newspa
per first because these events
could possibly have a great effect
on his own life.
