# Hands Across America seeks helping hand from Stanford
## 
### STUART BLOCK Staff writer 
"Hands Across America" is reaching out to the Stan
ford community with a plea for students and faculty to
"help the homeless and the hungry" by participating in
Sunday's attempt to link more than 6 million people and
span a nationwide route covering more than 4,000 miles.
"To hold hands is a symbol of brotherhood .. . people
to people," according to volunteer organizer Sharon
Jones. "That's why all of us are taking part."
As of Tuesday, the organization was some 2 million
people short of its desired 6 million participants. "The
major problems we have are in filling the deserts of
Arizona, Oklahoma, Texas and some parts of California,"
Jones told The Daily in a telephone interview.
While "Hands Across America" has some significant
problems of its own, the group has also caused at least one
inconvenience for other organizations — a national T
shirt shortage. Specifically, it seems "Hands Across
America" 's order of 6.5 million large, white, 100-percent
cotton shirts has exceeded the nationwide supply.
Nevertheless, "students desiring to participate are more
than encouraged," said Jones. "Where they could be most
useful is in Redlands. We have buses available (from San
Francisco), and we are encouraging people to form car
pools . .. it's really a worthwhile event, and we are all very
excited."
In translating the "Hands Across America" spirit to a
local level, community organizers have conceived "Hands
Down El Camino," a human chain that is to extend from
San Francisco to San Jose. The event will take place Sun

day at noon.
According to Sean Skelton, national coordinator of
Bike Aid '86 and member of Stanford's Public Service
Center, the organizers of "Hands Down El Camino"
began planning the event "just last Tuesday" and "have
done an amazing job in a very short amount of time."
"The best way I can think of for one to get involved."
Skelton advises, "is to just show up along El Camino
around 11."
Skelton called on Camino-comers to carry cash. "The
major purpose of this event is as a fundraiser, so partici
pants are asked to donate $10, but (organizers) are en
couraging people to give whatever they can whether it's a
buck, or three or 10," Skelton said.
Another Bay Area event scheduled in the "Hands
Across America" motif is radio station KFOG's "Hands
Across the Golden Gate," which will — you guessed it —
form a human chain across San Francisco's Golden Gate.
Although still short of the required 3,000 people (that's
6,000 hands), the event will take place Saturday morning
as a kick-off event to Sunday's "Hands Across America,"
KFOG's Irish Robbins said.
Registration for "Hands Across the Golden Gate" re
quires a $10 minimum donation and takes place at all
Bass ticket outlets. For more information, call the "Hands
Across the Golden Gate" hotline at 387-2178.
All of the proceeds raised by "Hands Across" events
will go to "Hands Across America's Fund for America's
Hungry and Homeless."

"Hands Across America," contact Sharon Jones at 494-
1752, or call 1-800-USA-9000.
