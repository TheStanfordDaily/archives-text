## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Media hype mars effort 
### 
Here's your chance to be a part of a once-in-a
lifetime event. America is joining hands to help the
hungry and the homeless. Lend a helping hand.
So reads the advertising campaign for Sunday's
"Hands Across America" project, an event that will
link more than 6 million people along a 4,000-mile
route that spans the entire country in hopes of raising
$100 million dollars for the homeless in the United
States. The ad shows a wrinkled hand reaching out for
the plump hand of a young child — the kind of stuff de
signed to touch one's heart.
The MTV video for "Hands Across America" is
equally heart-wrenching. Shots of sullen children with
saucer-like eyes saying things like, "I've always wanted
a home," are interspersed with scenes of pop-stars
such as Jane Fonda, Phil Collins, Sade and Barbra
Streisand in front of landmarks in cities across the
United States. Singing the "Hands Across America"
theme song, the stars join hands with average-types
and homeless-types in an attempt to display the
generosity, warmth and unity that supposedly marks
this country.
And it works.

It seems sad that many Americans are victims of
such media hype, that to be effective and far-reaching
a charitable event must use celebrities, T-shirts and
Top-40 tunes. In a sense, it is unfortunate that projects
such as "Hands" and 'USA for Africa" have become
an integral part of pop-culture. Most of the time, they
are one-shot events that rally support because of this
media hype, and the media portrays them as panacea
for the problems they address. In reality, however, the
problems persist when the projects end. It seems that
these projects could be more effective if they were in
conjunction with long-term projects. The general
public should not forget about the opportunity to help
the homeless and the hungry once the media has ex
hausted a certain issue.
On the other hand, such projects should be praised
for raising consciousness about these issues. They also
give people the opportunity to feel that they can do
something to help. And these projects usually do raise
large sums of money, at which one can't scoff.
So go join hands in the"the Line" for "Hands Across
America," but when you let go, don't simultaneously
drop from your mind the reason for holding hands.
