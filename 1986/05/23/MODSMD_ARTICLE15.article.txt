# Inefficiency plagues legal system
## 
### 
At the end of three years of law school, perhaps
it is time for me to reflect on our legal system. This
is not a task for which law school has prepared me
well. Law school teaches mountains of trivia, but it
manages both to be impractical (1 couldn't fight a
parking ticket any better now than 1 could three
years ago) and to miss almost completely any con
ception of how law fits into society.
My most interesting perspectives on law come
not from my professors, but from friends who
aren't at law school at all. (Law school has failed in
this regard; I still occasionally speak to people who
are not themselves in law.) Most of these friends
view the idea of getting into a lawsuit with about
the same enthusiasm as getting the plague. A few
friends have the vague feeling that by not knowing
about law, they are missing out on a way to cause
their enemies untold suffering and woe.

The same attitude is found even in the law
school. As a first-year law student, second-years
told me never to admit to women in bars that 1 was
involved with law. "They can't relate to it," I was
informed, and I'm sure my advisers spoke from ex
perience. When law students sue each other (it's
happened twice since I've been here), even the
other law students make fun of them. "Normal"
people aren't supposed to have to go to court to
solve their problems.
I wonder why this is so. In colonial America,
people apparently went to court much more often
than people do today, with no social stigma at
tached. Many societies have legal systems which
are quicker and cheaper than ours and which the
members of those societies think are fair and accu

rate. In such countries, people routinely rely on the
courts to solve everyday disputes.
Here, by contrast, many people (for instance,
friends of mine in medical or business school) seem
to believe that the outcomes of lawsuits bear only a
chance relationship to the actual facts underlying
those suits. Most Americnas think criminal cases
are driven entirely by technicalities unrelated to the
merits of the cases or the interests of the public.
Because of this and the time and expense involved
in bringing a lawsuit, the average American thinks
the courts are irrelevant to his problems. Most of
my non-law friends can recount several instances
where they think they were seriously wronged, but
didn't think there was anything they could do about
it.
What I am suggesting is that the American legal
system has ceased to be an effective method of sol
ving disputes for most Americans. I don't have any
specific proposals for reform: indeed, I'm not sure
incremental reform could solve the problem. 1 do
know that a lot of people are trying to exploit, for
their own purposes, this general societal discontent
with the legal system.
It is possible that the chief justice of the U.S. Su
preme Court, Warren Burger, urges "alternative
dispute resolution" in good faith. Most of the
people behind this movement for more mediation
and arbitration are not acting in good faith. There
may be times when mediating a dispute informally
is a good idea (for instance, disputes within
families). But most of the time, compulsory media
tion and arbitration just add new levels of bureau
cracy and procedure before a victim (of an acci
dent, of discrimination) can get compensation. In
stead of just filing a lawsuit, you go through media
tion, and then you file the lawsuit. The main point
seems to be to deter people from making claims
(even justified ones) at all.
Rose Bird, chief justice of the California Su
preme Court, is also receiving flack for the failings
of the legal system. Study after study shows that en
forcing the constitutional rights of those accused of
crimes has virtually no impact on the success rate of
criminal prosecutions. Crime only goes down if you

spend money on more cops, more prosecutors and
more jails. It's possible that Bird can still save her
job in her upcoming election if she orders a few
prisoners gassed at San Quentin. But it seems likely
that Bird, too, will become a victim of dissatisfac
tion with the courts (skillfully manipulated by con
servative media specialists) which is almost totally
outside of her control.

The most troubling manipulation of this discon
tent with the courts involves manufacturers, doc
tors and the insurance industry. These interests
have invented a completely fictional "litigation ex
plosion" so as to cut back the rights of the victims
they injure. Needless to say, cutting back victims'
rights will, in the long run. only increase dissatisfac
tion with the legal system, but in the short run big
money is at stake.
Three years of law school haven't taught me
what is wrong with our legal system. They have
taught me that something is wrong. Complicated
societies like ours need functioning legal systems. If
we don't do something to increase popular confi
dence :.n our system of justice, that system may
cease to function altogether.
