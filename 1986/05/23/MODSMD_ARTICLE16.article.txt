## SDI Trojan horse threatens peace 
### 
The anthropologist Gregory Bateson once
remarked that the worst thing about having a blind
spot in a particular area of perception is not that
you don't see, but that you can't see that you don't
see. The error is compounded, as it were, by the in
ability to acknowledge the existence of the blind
spot.
Among President Reagan's numerous blind
spots is the one which has led him to propose the
so-called "Star Wars" missile defense system, or
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Sanity, which I
define in absolute minimal terms as the possession
of a decent respect for the survival of everything
that lives, is disastrously lacking in every last detail
of its conception, planning and execution. 1 base
this conclusion on the following arguments:
• SDI will ix'qui re a whole new "third generation"
of nuclear weapons, thus fueling the nuclear arms
race that it allegedly is designed to do away with.

This year's budget request from the Department of
Energy lists five related areas of research: X-ray
lasers, hyper-velocity pellets, micro-waves, particle
beams and optical lasers.
Scientists at Los Alamos say that hundreds of ad
ditional underground nuclear bombing tests will be
needed to perfect third-generation weapons such as
the "nuclear pumped'" X-ray laser, a laser device
triggered by a thermonuclear bomb placed in
space. Such weapons won't end nuclear war, but
will extend the arms race into a new and hazardous
arena.
* SD! means that we will have to hnihl and launch
unclear reactors into space to power the space sta
tions that will control the anti-missile system. The
Chernobyl disaster and the launching fiascoes at
NASA do not inspire great confidence in this part
of the project. Officials say that the reactors will or
bit high enough to allow radioactive materials to
decay before the spacecraft tumbles back to earth.
But I have only their word for that. And what if it

never gets up there? One launching pad explosion
of a rocket carry ing plutonium could make a lot of
people very, very sorry for a long time.
• SDI will bankrupt everyone except the Depart
ment of Defense and its sub-contractors. Lifting all
the space-based elements into orbit could require
up to 5,000 shuttle flights carrying 200 million
pounds of material, costing up to $600 billion
based on today's space costs. Some experts have
placed the total cost at $ 1 trillion or more, and once
in place, its operating costs could run up to $200
billion a year.

• It won't work. As with any weapon in space,
whatever one side puts up, the other will learn to
shoot down or effectively neutralize. A Soviet
"threat cloud" of warheads, decoys, orbiting pel
lets. space mines and penetration aids — all filling
the air at the same time — might prove many times
larger that Star Wars planners had anticipated,
adding unforseen difficulties to the problem of de
tecting decoy targets. The Russians might surprise
us with an effective anti-satellite technology.
However, the system could never be tested:
Software containing more than 10 million lines of
computer codes would have to work perfectly the
first time. I'm sorry, but this is patently absurd.
Only a fool with blind faith could be talked into

believing in it for 10 seconds.
• SDI is more useful as an offensive than as a defen
sive weapon. High-intensity laser light from such
weapons could be used offensively to unleash huge
firestorms, producing an environmental disaster
similar to a nuclear winter. It thus provides a dan
gerously destabilizing force at every stage of its
existence. Why should the Soviets trust our nuclear
sanity when we will have made it clear that we
don't trust theirs?
If we allow ourselves to be convinced by
Reagan's disarming rhetoric, patriotic embellish-

ments and endearing smile, then we are truly a na
tion of fools. A continuing and unchecked spirall
ing of the nuclear arms race, even if it is sold to the
American people in the name of peace, increases
the probability — and at some point the in
evitability — of purposeful or accidental nuclear
war.
The Great Salesman in the White House is trying
to sell us mislabeled merchandise. SDI is a Trojan
horse painted with empty promises. It is based on a
dangerous fantasy of technological omniscience
completely inappropriate to the demands of the nu
clear age.

of the project. Officials say that the reactors will or
bit high enough to allow radioactive materials to
decay before the spacecraft tumbles back to earth.
But I have only their word for that. And what if it

never gets up there? One launching pad explosion
of a rocket carry ing plutonium could make a lot of
people very, very sorry for a long time.
• SDI will bankrupt everyone except the Depart
ment of Defense and its sub-contractors. Lifting all
the space-based elements into orbit could require
up to 5,000 shuttle flights carrying 200 million
pounds of material, costing up to $600 billion
based on today's space costs. Some experts have
placed the total cost at $ 1 trillion or more, and once
in place, its operating costs could run up to $200
billion a year.

• It won't work. As with any weapon in space,
whatever one side puts up, the other will learn to
shoot down or effectively neutralize. A Soviet
"threat cloud" of warheads, decoys, orbiting pel
lets. space mines and penetration aids — all filling
the air at the same time — might prove many times
larger that Star Wars planners had anticipated,
adding unforseen difficulties to the problem of de
tecting decoy targets. The Russians might surprise
us with an effective anti-satellite technology.
However, the system could never be tested:
Software containing more than 10 million lines of
computer codes would have to work perfectly the
first time. I'm sorry, but this is patently absurd.
Only a fool with blind faith could be talked into

believing in it for 10 seconds.
• SDI is more useful as an offensive than as a defen
sive weapon. High-intensity laser light from such
weapons could be used offensively to unleash huge
firestorms, producing an environmental disaster
similar to a nuclear winter. It thus provides a dan
gerously destabilizing force at every stage of its
existence. Why should the Soviets trust our nuclear
sanity when we will have made it clear that we
don't trust theirs?
If we allow ourselves to be convinced by
Reagan's disarming rhetoric, patriotic embellish-

ments and endearing smile, then we are truly a na
tion of fools. A continuing and unchecked spirall
ing of the nuclear arms race, even if it is sold to the
American people in the name of peace, increases
the probability — and at some point the in
evitability — of purposeful or accidental nuclear
war.
The Great Salesman in the White House is trying
to sell us mislabeled merchandise. SDI is a Trojan
horse painted with empty promises. It is based on a
dangerous fantasy of technological omniscience
completely inappropriate to the demands of the nu
clear age.
