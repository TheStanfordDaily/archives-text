Forum on culture
polarized issues
I was both impressed and
distressed by what took place Tues
day at the forum on Western Culture.
I have spent my academic career as a
historian of China, and I am a mem
ber of the group which designed and
presents the "World Outside the
West" course sequence. A couple of
years ago, when Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Norman Wessells estab
lished the Humanities Council, I
wrote to protest the absence of any
representative of a non-Western cul
tural tradition.
Since 1 am deeply committed to the
importance of cultural breadth and
diversity at the core of Stanford's
liberal arts education, 1 hope that dis
satisfaction with the Western Culture
tracks is a sign that a better curricu
lum may eventually emerge from all
this noise. At the forum I was im
pressed once again by the way in
which student energy can get the Uni
versity moving.
But the rhetorical level and tone —
overstatement and oversimplifica
tion, polarization of issues, making a
caricature of the other, non sequitur
— were nevertheless distressing, even
in the service of a potentially good
cause.
Some other things might have been
said, Tuesday night or sometime.
Western Culture does not, I believe,
speak only to the concerns and self
interest of white males. In the
"Apology" and the "Crito," Socrates
talks of what it means to be human,
regardless of culture. Hamlet is not of
interest only to Danish princes.
What a broadened curriculum
might better show all of us, including
freshmen and sophomores, is that
other cultures can also tell us some
thing of dignity, loyalty and serenity
in the face of death.
We might learn many things worth
knowing about human variety, about
individuals, groups and ultimately

ourselves. We might learn of the
many ways environments influence
culture; of different family structures,
class structures, extraction and
utilization of resources; of values,
ethics, religious systems; of interac
tions and interdependencies of
cultures that seem distant and sepa
rate.
We might appreciate more specifi
cally than we do now that no people
(or gender) has a monopoly on
soaring triumphs of the spirit — nor
on cruelty, exploitation and folly. We
would see the underside of Western
civilization, which is thrown into
sharp relief when it contacts other
cultures. But we would also see the
humanistic ethics of Confucius and
Mencius and that the Chinese treated
aboriginal people who stood in the
way of their expansion much in the
same say that white settlers on this
continent treated native Americans.
As we understand better the range
and limits of human experience and
possibility, as we appreciate more
fully the particularity of our own cul
tural arrangements and preferences,
and as we see more clearly the inter
relationships between and among
cultures, we become more truly and
more liberally educated.
I believe that the Western Culture
track as presently structured imposes
a certain parochiality on the Stanford
curriculum. Restructuring a core cur
riculum will not be easy, not so much,
I believe, because of unwillingness on
the part of the administration as be
cause of two other constraints: (a) on
the faculty's time and energy and (b)
on the students' time and energy.
If the faculty could teach all the
courses it believed valuable and if
students could take all the courses
they wished, the problem would be a
great deal simpler. Unfortunately
neither condition exists, but the task
is no less pressing. Let us move for
ward with determination, but also
with mutual tolerance and good faith.
