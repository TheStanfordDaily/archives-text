## Stanford Comedy Club is a laughing matter 
### ALICE PETERS Staff writer 
Have the end-of-the-quarter, too-many
finals-and-I-don't-even-have-a-summer-job-
yet blues got you down?
Can you believe that, for a small fee, two
guys named Rob Schneider and Tom Kenny
will administer an antidote?
Kenny and Schneider, both Bay Area com
edians, are performing tonight in the Lagunita
Dining Hall, thanks to the efforts of the Stan
ford Comedy Club.
As an added bonus, this Lagunita lark will
not be the debut performance for these com
edians. In fact, the director of the Comedy
Club, junior Jim Durkin, said Schneider and
Kenny have both appeared in the major clubs
of San Francisco, including Wolfgang's, The
Punchline and The Other Cafe.

"These guys are both classic stand-up com
edians," said Durkin, director of the Comedy
Club.
Schneider, who has appeared on the televi
sion program "Comedy Tonight," is a well
known Bay Area comedian. "We run into
people who know who he is all the time," said
senior Ed Anderson, financial manager for
the Comedy Club.
Even those who've never seen Schneider
perform might think he looks somewhat
familiar. "We have pictures of him, and he
looks sort of like a short Billy Joel," Ander
son explained.
Some say Schneider bears no small
resemblance to Elvis Presley. "1 do Elvis and
Priscilla Presley in my act," he said. "I'll be
reading a book ('Elvis and Me") on stage,
too."
Although Schneider has never performed

at Stanford before, he said he is looking for
ward to it."I like performing for college stu
dents," he said.
"I'm going to be wearing my lizard-skin
shoes, so obviously this show is very impor
tant to me."
Schneider also said he is looking forward to
being billed with Kenny, because the two
have worked together before. "Tom Kenny
and I are pals. He's a very funny guy,"
Schneider said.
Durkin agreed. "Tom Kenny is a very fast
talking guy. He hits you with a lot of jokes at a
time."
Anderson called Kenny "basically insane."
He also pointed out that Kenny is a featured
comedian this month on a cable TV program.
On the program, Anderson said, "he's
billed as a living cartoon character. He has so
much energy that you're bound to start laugh

ing within about five minutes — less than that,
actually."
The Comedy Club, which has about 10 core
members, has only been in existence for a few
months.
"It was just sort of an impromptu thing,"
Durkin explained. "It was something I
thought would go over pretty well, and so did
the rest of the guys."
Durkin, who is also promotions manager
for the Stanford Concert Network, said he has
wanted to bring comedians to campus for a
long time. But the Concert Network has not
had the time to organize such visits, he said.
"The Concert Network is such a busy or
ganization with music, that you really need a
separate organization for comedy," he said.
If all goes well tonight, the Comedy Club
would like to organize a bi-weekly comedy se
ries for fall quarter. "Ideally, we'd like to put

on a series with the San Francisco club com
edians," Durkin explained.
Anderson noted that with ticket prices at
$3 in advance and $4 at the door, the
"Comedy Spotlight" Is relatively inexpensive
weekend entertainment. "Comedy in general
is really cut-throat competition, so the enter
tainment value is a lot better than music or
movies," he said.
Additionally, the fact that the Comedy
Club is a student organization means that it
can charge lower prices than San Francisco
clubs. "We're sponsored by the ASSU Pro
gram Board, and Budweiser also pitched in a
lot of bucks," Durkin said.
Although Durkin stressed that tickets for
tonight's shows are going fast, there are still
some available.
Tickets will be available today from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. in White Plaza and at the door. The
two shows begin at 7:30 and 11 p.m.

ganization with music, that you really need a
separate organization for comedy," he said.
If all goes well tonight, the Comedy Club
would like to organize a bi-weekly comedy se
ries for fall quarter. "Ideally, we'd like to put

on a series with the San Francisco club com
edians," Durkin explained.
Anderson noted that with ticket prices at
$3 in advance and $4 at the door, the
"Comedy Spotlight" Is relatively inexpensive
weekend entertainment. "Comedy in general
is really cut-throat competition, so the enter
tainment value is a lot better than music or
movies," he said.
Additionally, the fact that the Comedy
Club is a student organization means that it
can charge lower prices than San Francisco
clubs. "We're sponsored by the ASSU Pro
gram Board, and Budweiser also pitched in a
lot of bucks," Durkin said.
Although Durkin stressed that tickets for
tonight's shows are going fast, there are still
some available.
Tickets will be available today from 11 a.m.
to 1 p.m. in White Plaza and at the door. The
two shows begin at 7:30 and 11 p.m.
