# Lyons names Dean's Awards recipients
## 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN Senior staff writer 
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons last week
selected seven students to receive Dean's Awards
for Service for spring quarter.
Award recipients are Courtney Hightower,
David Hoffman, Steven Long, George Russell
Poore, Ricardo Rosenkranz, David Wyman and
Jeffrey Zimman.
According to Lyons, in order to be considered
for the Dean s Award one must be nominated by a
member of the Stanford community for performing
a valuable service. Lyons said the term "service"
was left vague so as to encompass the wide and
diverse range of contributions made by students.
George Russell Poore, a senior in industrial engi
neering, was nominated by his adviser, Ted Hoef,
for "setting a new standard in fraternity leadership
in confronting important social issues; and for RA
successes in Durand and ATO; and for TA suc
cesses in industrial engineering, establishing him
self in all settings as a devoted and skilled leader z

educator and diplomat."
Poore is also the president of the Sigma Phi Ep
silon fraternity, which conducted a dry Rush this
spring and co-sponsored a campus-wide showing of
the film " Rethinking Rape" with the Rape Educa
tion Project.
Poore called his experience with Sigma Phi Ep
silon "one of the most important things I'm doing
here at Stanford," but added that "everything I'm
doing here is important to me."
Branner RA David Hoffman was nominated by
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jackson for "the
inspiration to bring the Vietnam Mobile Memorial
Wall to Stanford, for the three months of hard
work that followed . . . and ultimately, for the brief
presence of the wall itself, an experience that
touched and enriched the lives of many members of
the Stanford community."
Hoffman said he was surprised when Lyons
named him as an award recipient. "What the wall
brought to Stanford was rewarding enough, but this
award is icing on the cake," he said.

Another member of the Branner staff, non
matriculated graduate student Steve Long, also
received a Dean's Award. Long created the aca
demic coordinator position in Branner, which pro
vides reside nee-based tutoring in conjunction with
more general academic advising.
Long was praised by Director of Undergraduate
Advising Audrey Bernfield for "serving so well the
needs of Branner residents as A A (advising associ
ate), RA, and now as academic coordinator; for his
organizational savvy in recruiting tutors, aligning
support and ensuring good communications among
all parties; and for his unaltering focus on students,
recognizing that all these residential resources are
for naught unless the students themselves benefit."
Long plans to continue work on his advising pro
gram next year. "I developed this year's advising
program specifically with Branner in mind, but next
year I'm going to be working to expand the pro
gram to other dorms," he said.
A ceremony and dinner will be held at Lyons'
home for the award recipients and their guests on
Wednesday.
