# Listen to the tick-tock and Swatch time fade away

Let's talk about the Swatch.
TICK.
"Don't forget: You're going to die
soon,"
TICK.
it says rather loudly.
TICK.
But at least you can be colorfully
clad while you're waiting: polka dot
implosions, paisley kerdoodles,
abstract cubist plaids swathing your
wrists not once,
TICK.
not twice,
TICK.
but many times.
TICK.
You're up to your elbows in clack
ing, schizophrenic clocks.
TICK.
You can even buy a timepiece to
match your eyes, your wanna-be
punk hightops, your nail polish, your
car interior, your existential philoso
phy, your significant other, your fruit

at-the-bottom jello, the Swatches you
bought last week.
TICK.
But you'll have to sustain close
epidermal contact with these plastics
that come in your choice of Jelly-
Belly-carcinogen colors — chemo
therapy colada, cyanide squirt, mush
room cloud cola, and the ever
popular
TICK.
rum radiation.
TICK.
Swatches — Swatches everywhere
— Swatches in space with the
satellites, under your bed at night, in
John Cameron Swayze's mouth,
taking a licking, they keep on
TICK.
-ing, in Ronald McDonaldland,
united under the colors of Benetton,
on the fork with your Chicken
Chalupa. . .
TICK.
But you'd think they were an en
dangered species the way people
guard them so with those gooey rub
ber strands, saving them — 1 suppose

Swatches were
goosestepping
over their Tron
esque gridirons,
flying their Carte
sian plane over
the horizon.

— as heirlooms for their kids. It's just
not the same as a heavy, gold,
engraved pocket watch, complete
with fob and chain and grandfather
script, Palmer Method numbers.
TICK.
You shouldn't trust things that

don't need winding; it's too easy to
forget about mortality that way.
(Matchbox racers need winding,
pitchers wind up, the 1-17 is winding,
spring quarter means unwinding.)
TICK.
I much prefer alarm clocks. A clock

should jolt you awake, not just before
your first class, but every time you
look at it. Wondering where you are
on the astral plane? San Quentin
clangs the issue shut — the trendy
temporal handcuff.
TICK.
Digital watches are synthesized —
maybe simulated — immortality, the
anti-Christ, or worse, the anti-Mickey
that sits on my wrist, assuming the
aspect of Charlie Tuna, always
apologizing for the fact that, even
though I wind it every morning, it al
ways slows, comes to a stop during
the night at 3:17,
TICK.
and waits at that spot for me to
retrieve it, sending early condolences
for the fact that soon I will forget, and
I will look down at my wrist one
bright afternoon to find the horror of
3:17 a.m.
TICK. TICK. TICK.
Salvador Dali would have
microwaved every Swatch he could
lay a brush on — about two minutes
on the bake setting should do it.

While his clocks oozed across the
landscape, hands dangling meaning
lessly at their sides and numbers
looking perplexed at their elongated
state, the Swatches were goosestep
ping with quartz precision over their
Tron-esque gridirons, flying their
Cartesian plane to a disappearing
horizon.
TICK. (I'm getting ticked off here;
let's set the timer to 2:00:00. . ; )
TlCKkkkk. ..
Swatches have no numbers, not
even one. usually, to relieve your ver
tigo. There is this one version that
shows pieces of what could be called
numbers in an elegant black and
white collage of serifs and angles. I
guess that's the eveningwear model.
Sorry, Charlie, I'm not buying that
tugboat of tuna.
And people who wear Swatches
will also put their feet in K-Swiss
pseudo-athletic shoes and drive
scooters; I think about 45 seconds on
radiate would take care of them.
I know this is a ticklish issue, but
that's how I feel.
