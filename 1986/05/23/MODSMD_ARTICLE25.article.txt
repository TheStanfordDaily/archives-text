In our article of May 2nd, we derived a new energy equation
given as:
E = mc77-Df/0
Where
E = Energy (rest energy)
m = Proton rest mass
c = Velocity of light
7tD = Photon orbit circumference
112 = Frequency of orbit in cycles per second
0 = Actual photon orbit divided by minimum
photon orbit
After deriving this equation, we claimed protons, electrons,
and neutrons were described within the equation (May 2nd
and May 9th articles). We further hinted that the equation, or
a form of it, represented Einstein's dream for a unified field
theory (May 9th article). Finally, we contended momentum
was a pure physical entity not divisible into component parts
of mass and velocity (May 9th and 16th articles). We come
now to the author's moment of truth. Can he provide an ob
served event which lends support to all these claims?
If momentum is a pure physical entity, we would be more
correct to rewrite our energy equation as:
E = pirDi/6 where p = momentum
It is necessary to now backtrack a little before proceeding.
The author's personal favorite derivation, because of its
simplicity, for obtaining the new energy equation was to
write velocity as the geometric statement v = vDt When v
equaled c, this became c = nDi. This geometric expression
for velocity was then substituted into Einstein's equation for
the rest energy of a proton (Eo = moc 2 ) to obtain
Eo = moC7rDf/0. Since we are requiring momentum to be
pure, in place of the mass-velocity product, we write
Einstein's rest energy equation as, Eo = poc and on sub
stituting 7rDf for c obtain Eo = po7rDf. Previously (May 2nd
article), we extended the equation by calling on the equa
tion, E = hf and defined Planck's constant, h, as equal to
moC7rD, from which we were then able to arrive at the need
for the ft term. We could enact this same sequence, defining
po7rD as h, however, we are looking for a unified field equa
tion (one applicable to both macro and atomic worlds) so we
are forced to take a somewhat different approach.

The formula for the conservation of angular momentum of a
system can be written as:
L = mvr or L = pr, where L = angular momentum
We would be equally correct in writing this conservation law
as:
L = mvD or L = pD
L = mv7rD or L = p7rD
We return to our equation Eo = po7rDf and again attack the
problem of extension. If po7rD is to be conserved, we can
only decrease Eo by reducing 112. If 112, the cycles per second of
a body of momentum po is reduced nD must increase or po
must decrease (remember velocity does not come into play
since we are taking momentum to be a pure entity). How
can we increase 7tD or decrease po and conserve the value
of the term po7rD? I discern only one way. We need another
term. The equation becomes, Eo = po7rDf/0 and the term,
po7rD/0 is said to be constant.
Someone n > ght feel we could avoid the 6 term by simultane
ously increasing nD and reducing po. This only confirms the
author's claim that a particle's momentum is dependent on
the orbit size, however, to be consistent with our prior
derivation of May 2nd, we hold to writing the equation in
terms of its maximum momentum (po) and state that the
term po/0 is the effective momentum (on May 2nd we made
mo 10 the effective mass).
While we started by substituting into Eo = moc 2 (more
precisely Eo = poc), we could have started with E = mv 2
(E = pv), or KE = 1 /2 mv 2 ( 1 /2 pv). That is the equation does
not depend on our selecting Einstein's equation with the
implied velocity c. In addition, since the equation was
derived taking the momentum term as pure, we could say
the equation also does not depend on mass.
We began by saying this was the author's moment of truth
and asked whether he could provide an observed event to
support the new equation. It is known, from prior experi
ments, when light falls in a gravitational field it experiences
a gain in frequency. Ironically, though not surprisingly, this
was one of Einstein's proposed tests for his General Theory
of Relativity. A photon with higher frequency has higher mo
mentum. That is a photon falling in a gravitational field,
moving closer to the center of the field, has its momentum
increase.

A body falling in a gravitational field shows an increase in
velocity. A body with higher velocity has higher momentum.
That is a body falling in a gravitational field, moving closer to
the center of the field, has its momentum increases. When
we take momentum as pure the two events are equivalent.
Increases in the momentum of light falling in a gravitational
field are very slight. So called electromagnetic fields (we
contend only one field exists created by rate changes in mo
mentum) are 10 39 stronger than gravitational fields. Light
falling in an electromagnetic field, moving closer to center,
would thus experience a dramatic increase in momentum,
so much so, electrons (photons in circular orbits) falling into
orbits whose circumference matched the proton would ac
quire effective masses (more precisely effective orbital
momentums) matching the proton.
We have come full circle since we began these articles on
May 2nd. If it seems a little difficult for readers to accept
mass is the creation of our physics, as was stated in previ
ous papers, then it may be more difficult to ask you to ac
cept that velocity is also the creation of our physics. The
problem arises from our worm's eye view of the universe. In
the macro world we feel comfortable splitting momentum
into component parts of a constant mass and a variable
velocity. If we lived in the atomic world, we might conclude
we could split momentum into component parts of a con
stant velocity (c) and a variable mass. When we look at both
worlds and attempt to describe both in a consistent manner
we find momentum to be pure and variable with its value de
pendent on its orbit and its frequency.
General relativity is renowned for its principle of equiv
alence. Gravity and acceleration are equivalent, or one form
of changes in the velocity with time is equivalent to another
form of changes in velocity with time. In our work, which is
an extension of general relativity theory, we have enacted
another principle of equivalence. The author has proposed
that electromagnetic energy, rest energy, and kinetic energy
are equivalent. Energy is energy. It was from this energy
equivalence hypothesis, and not from the approaches
delineated in the May 2nd article, that the new energy equa
tion, E = p7rDf/0 was originally derived. Our conflict with
quantum mechanics is this equivalence statement. Quan
tum mechanics contends each form of energy is distinct and
defined by separate physical laws. We contend one law,
represented by our new equation, describes all forms of en
ergy.
To bring attention to my work, I have been critical of quan
tum physicists who block the path of acceptance. Quantum
physicists are not more guilty of blocking knowledge than
any other institution that professes to have all the answers,
or if not all, contend the answers can come only from within
their institution or from the direction of their choosing.
Today s knowledge is but the resting place of yesterday's
curiosity. When curiosity is stirred knowledge moves on. A
restless curiosity has never been, and will never be, the ex
clusive property of a select group.
