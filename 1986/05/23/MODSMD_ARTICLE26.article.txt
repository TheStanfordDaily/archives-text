## Found: a hidden pearl in seafood restaurants 
### TIM HARTMAN LIZ EGAN 
Pearl's Oyster Bar
535 Ramona
Palo Alto
328-2722
Pearl's is not the kind of restaurant
where a friendly waiter will cater to
your every whim. In fact, one of the
mottos followed by the staff is: "The
customer isn't always right," which
translates to "If a customer wants
decaffinated coffee, send 'em across
the street to The Good Earth 'cuz we
don't serve it here."
What they do serve at Pearl's is
good, fresh seafood.
One of the reasons Pearl's is so
particular about what it does serve
is due to lack of space. The restaurant
is so tightly tucked in a courtyard on
Ramona that there is no extra room
to store anything — so only the
freshest ingredients can be served.
On the evening we visited Pearl's,
five different varieties of oysters were
featured — Blue Point, Emerald
Point, Willapas, Portugese and Wes

cott. We (logically) ordered a combi
nation platter, which came with all
but the Willapas.
One of the more interesting
features of Pearl's is the oyster
shucker. Standing in a fishbowl-like
display case in the middle of the res
taurant, he opens the shellfish and ar
ranges them with slices of lemon on
beds of ice.
We had our combo served with a
good bottle of Pouilly-Fume (Pearl's
features mostly white wines for ob
vious reasons).
Only with a very discriminating
tongue can one tell the difference be
tween the varieties of oysters. The
Wescotts grow, suspended by nets,
above the ocean floor (quite a life,
huh?). The result is delicate, creamy
flesh.
The Portugese and Blue Points, on
the other hand, have a saltier, more
oceany flavor that most associate with
seafood shellfish. The Emerald Points
have a more delicate texture than the
Blue Points and are the least stringy
of all the oysters.
In concordance with the fresh shell

fish, the menu is handwritten on a
chalkboard — it obviously changes
daily, maybe even hourly.
Following the oyster appetizer, we
sampled a bowl of New England clam
chowder. In our opinion, the quality
of this essential can make or break a
seafood restaurant. Pearl's passed
this test with flying colors. The hearty
broth tasted as if it had been sim
mered for many hours. We actually
found whole clams in the soup and,
fortunately, not a vast quantity of
potato.
A gentleman wearing torn jeans
and a 49'ers hat (our waiter Zack)
delivered our entrees. On his recom
mendation, we had ordered the
halibut and the prawn with broccoli
sautee. Rice pilaf and asparagus ac
companied our main course.
The fish was grilled and veiy tasty.
A squirt of fresh lemon juice was all
that was needed to accent this light
yet meaty fish.
The sautee was very big indeed,
plentifully stocked with plump
prawns. In fact, we could not even
finish them all. No fancy sauce

smothered this sautee: instead it was
allowed to stand on the merits of its
fresh ingredients.
Other selections on the menu in
clude Rainbow trout, garlic prawns.
Alaskan halibut, Oysters Rockefeller,
calimari and pesto salad, and shrimp
or prawn cocktails. Prices for the
larger entrees range from $8 to $ 14.
Don't bother asking for dessert —
Pearl's doesn't offer any . . . and most
likely you'll already be filled up on
their food.
So, even without the big dessert
tray, the long wine list and the com
puterized ordering system, Pearl's
succeeds in serving some of the best
seafood around. And with such a
relaxed atmosphere, who can help
but enjoy a meal here.
After our coffee, one of the owners
walked by, and we asked if he could
let our waiter know we were ready for
the check. No problem. He simply
shouted across the patio, "Zack, they
want their check, and they're sick of
waiting for it." One doesn't get out of
Pearl's without leaving a few giggles
behind.

sautee. Rice pilaf and asparagus ac
companied our main course.
The fish was grilled and veiy tasty.
A squirt of fresh lemon juice was all
that was needed to accent this light
yet meaty fish.
The sautee was very big indeed,
plentifully stocked with plump
prawns. In fact, we could not even
finish them all. No fancy sauce

smothered this sautee: instead it was
allowed to stand on the merits of its
fresh ingredients.
Other selections on the menu in
clude Rainbow trout, garlic prawns.
Alaskan halibut, Oysters Rockefeller,
calimari and pesto salad, and shrimp
or prawn cocktails. Prices for the
larger entrees range from $8 to $ 14.
Don't bother asking for dessert —
Pearl's doesn't offer any . . . and most
likely you'll already be filled up on
their food.
So, even without the big dessert
tray, the long wine list and the com
puterized ordering system, Pearl's
succeeds in serving some of the best
seafood around. And with such a
relaxed atmosphere, who can help
but enjoy a meal here.
After our coffee, one of the owners
walked by, and we asked if he could
let our waiter know we were ready for
the check. No problem. He simply
shouted across the patio, "Zack, they
want their check, and they're sick of
waiting for it." One doesn't get out of
Pearl's without leaving a few giggles
behind.
