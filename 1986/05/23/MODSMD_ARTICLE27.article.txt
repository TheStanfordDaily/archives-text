# Wouldn't you say it's a bit 'Bohemian' here?

Yes, it's a theater. And a mighty good
one, too. The New Varsity certainly has
become a cornerstone in the history of Palo
Alto. Even the back alleys show off the
quirky Bohemian subcultures.
But this "movie palace" boasts more than
just great old films and a friendly bar. The
New Varsity includes a wonderful restaurant
as well.
Keeping in touch with the general
random-and-somewhat-beyond-yuppie
theme of the theater (the whole town?), the
menu includes selections ranging from Posh
pizza with chevre and Kaseri cheeses to
spinach salad, from the McVarsity BLT on
toasted sourdough to fresh tomato fusilli
Alfredo, and from French onion soup
gratinee to the Aioli burger with garlic sauce
from Provence.
Quite a selection, eh? Even the "small

dinner salad" for $1.50 was subtly exotic
and enough for both of us. Tossed in with
the mixed greens were carrots, broccoli,
cauliflower and jicama (or so my date
proclaimed, though my digging could un
cover no more). Skillfully pre-tossed, the
light buttermilk-bleu cheese dressing did not
hide the crunchy vegetables.
A self-proclaimed expert on black bean
chili, my companion ordered the $4.75
specialty along with the turkey breast,
avocado and jalapeno jack cheese sandwich
for $3.95.
The chili was served with sweet and hot
peppers, tomatoes, avocados, cilantro, sharp
cheddar cheese and sour cream and was
seasoned with cumin and garlic. The dish
was wonderfully spicy (plenty for the ex
pert), but the beans were slightly dry.
Alongside the bowl was a generous slice of
very corny sourdough.
It was the turkey sandwich that got the ex
clamation marks. This creation was lightly
grilled on sourdough bread and stacked
rather high. The inch-tall pile of turkey
slices was definitely among the tenderest
around. The optionals included onion,
tomato and lettuce on the side. For sand

wich lovers, this version of the turkey kind
should not be missed.
I decided to try one of the pasta dishes in
stead of a sandwich. What arrived was Pal
mieri's cheese and spinach ravioli ($7.50).
Served in a small platter were plenty of huge
square ravioli covered with a creamy
spinach and mushroom sauce. At first the
thin sauce was disappointing, but after
eating all the generously filled heavy pasta, I
was thankful for the difference. The entree
came with two slices of garlic toast to sop up
the leftover mushrooms and spinach.
A chocolate mousse torte ($2) and two
coffees finalized our filling meal. The thick,
rich fudge was deliciously topped with a dab
of whipped cream and, not surprisingly, dis
appeared within seconds.
We only ordered plain, black coffees, but
the New Varsity offers a wide variety of spe
cial coffee concoctions.
And now for the bonus prize: The New
Varsity charges only $2 for movie admission
with each $6 dinner on the same evening!
Quelle bargain! So, next time you go out for
a movie (After Hours, Desperately Seeking
Susan and The Wall begin tonight), plan
ahead and enjoy a fine meal as well.
