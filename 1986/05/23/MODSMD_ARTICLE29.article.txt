# And then I said: "Ahhhhhh!"

I must admit, it took about a week
of mental preparation for this day. It
was not, after all, a typical Sunday. /
was going to jump out of a plane.
Repeat: / . . . was . . . going . .. to
.. . jump . . . out ... of ... a ...
plane.
Well, today is Friday, and I'm here
to tell.
It all started when Adventure
Aerosports, Inc. called and wanted a
story in The Daily about their new
form of sky diving, called tandem
jumping. I said, "Sure," and set a
date for the jump — my only thought
being that it would make a good
story, something different from the
usual restaurants.
It wasn't until the date got a little
closer that I began to seriously ques
tion what 1 was about to do. / was
going to jump out of a plane. Should I
tell my parents before or after?
Should I make out a will? Who would

take care of my turtle? I had a mid
term on Monday! These were crucial
questions in my possibly very short
future.
But in the end, nothing was so
pressing that I had to turn this offer
down. Now 1 just look back at how
silly 1 was. If someone were to ask me
to jump out of a plane right now, 1
would (with a parachute, that is).
And so the story begins. I arrived
with a friend at the little airport in
Hollister at about 10 a.m. Sunday
morning and introduced myself to
Steve, a Harley rider who also hap
pened to be one of the people in
charge.
After signing away my life, Steve
led us into the next room and showed
us some great videos of colorful (not
to mention daring) skydivers. There
was even one about a sky diving con
vention that attracts hundreds of en
ergetic jumpers each year.
We then met our "jumpmaster."
Brian, an engineering student, is only
23, but has logged over 600 jumps.

The briefing for the jump I was
about to take was not very involved
because the jumpmaster controls
most of the maneuvers. Tandem
jumping is a revolutionary concept in
sky diving. It has only been available
since 1984.
The unique thing about tandem
jumping is that there is only one
parachute for both the jumpmaster
and you (me)'. It's the perfect oppor
tunity for someone to learn to skydive
— an expert is there to guide you
through the jump and make sure
everything goes safely.
The most exciting thing about this
type of jumping is that it allows the
beginner to "enjoy" a 25-second free
fall before the tandem master pulls
the ripcord and deploys the
parachute. / was going to jump out of
a plane. And freefall.
I was fitted to a harness that was
then fastened to the jumpmaster's
harness. The assembly places me in
front of the expert with the top of my
head at the same level as his chest.

We jumped from a Cessna-182 .. .
not a large aircraft. In fact, we
crammed four people in it besides the
pilot, Bill Gere, who just happens to
be the owner of Adventure
Aerosports.
After we practiced jumping out of
the plane a few times while still on the
ground, the plane roared its engine
and circled over to the runway for the
takeoff. This was it. / was going to
jump out of plane.
Due to the size of the plane and the
harness, 1 sat on Brian's lap in the
doorless doorway while the plane
made its ascent. Needless to say, my
eyes were concentrating on the
ground. At the disappearing ground.
5,000. 6,000. 7,000. 7,500.
"Okay," Brian said, "remember the
rules?" My mind drew a blank so he
repeated them: "Good body position,
keep your eyes open, smile and have
fun." Simple enough.
He put his left foot out. I put my
left foot out. I put my right foot out.
He put his right foot out. I crossed my
arms and grabbed my shoulders.
" Ready .. . JUMP!"
It was those first five seconds that I
have a little trouble remembering.
Complete and utter sensory overload.
After those first couple seconds, 1
got the "hang" of it. My eyes were
wide open, and I had a smile from ear
to ear. Here I was .. . FALLING.
And down THERE was the earth. It
was unlikely that anyone could hear
my squeal between my clenched
teeth: "This is GREAT!"
Although we were using a
"drogue," a smail chute the size of a
beachball, to slow us down a bit, the
difference was certainly unnoticeable
to me. We were still falling at about
120 miles-per-hour. When the main
chute was pulled, I was almost disap
pointed. 1 could have fallen some
more. But 1 did say "almost."
There was a slight swing backwards
when the chute filled, but this is
nowhere near the strong pull suffered
by less-advanced chutes, I hear.
We "casually" floated down to our
target, situated in a cow pasture. With
lines called "toggles," I helped Brian
steer and even stalled the chute (a
really weird sensation in the middle
of the sky).
We circled right and left, making
the trip last as long as possible . . .
just a few minutes. Our landing was
too simple. In fact, the whole thing
was too simple. Why isn't everybody
flying down from planes? (hee!)

Seriously, I recommend skydiving
to anyone who has the money to
spend. The first jump, for either a
tandem or a static line, costs $145.
Adventure Aerosports is offering
these jumps for $120 during the
months of May and June. This cost is
mainly for the training, as the next
jump will cost considerably less
(about $30).
The static line jumps are for people

who want the experience of jumping
by themselves (they sacrifice the
freefall). From 3,000 feet in the air,
the person is dropped off and the
chute is pulled automatically by a
cord.
Group rates are available. Just give
Bill Gere a call at (408)-636-0117.
About 40 Stanford students have
already taken that "first step." I did.
I jumped out of a plane.

The landing part of tandem jumping is remarkably easy — just put your feet out and stand up (or is it stand
down?). 1

For the first 25 seconds of my skydiving experience, we simply fell. The
jumpmaster is holding his arms out, I'm just below . . . and the rest is
ground.
