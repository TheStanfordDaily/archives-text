## Group addresses letter to trustees 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Fourteen Stanford faculty mem
bers are collecting signatures for a
letter that condemns as "an insult to
the entire community" the Board of
Trustees' recent decision to divest
$9,900 of the University's holdings in
South Africa-related companies.
Microbiology Prof. Leon Rosen
berg, who penned a first draft of the
letter, said last night that about 16
faculty and staff, in addition to the 14
organizers, have signed the letter,
which is still circulating.
The letter, formulated Monday by
the scholars and intended for publica
tion in next week's Campus Report,
represents an effort to "show the
Stanford community that it's not just
students, but (also) faculty who are
fighting for divestment," according to
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, one of
the faculty members involved.
The trustees, who follow a long
standing policy of "selective divest
ment" from companies that do busi
ness with South Africa's apartheid
regime, decided last week to sell the
University's shares of Newmont Min
ing, the board's first such move.
In their letter, the faculty members
criticize the board's action as
"callous, unfeeling land] deliberately
provocative," pointing out that the
amount represents only "one ten
thousandth of the stockholdings of
this University in companies doing
business in South Africa."
Stanford currently owns shares of
South Africa-related stock valued at
$ 183 million.

Biological Sciences Prof. Dow Wood
ward, Anthropology Prof. St. Clair
Drake, Anesthesia Lecturer M. Jack
Frumin and Statistics Prof. Charles
Stein, who was arrested at an Old
Union anti-apartheid protest in Octo
ber.
The letter has also been signed by
Lise Giraud, a librarian at Green Li
brary, and the Rev. Byron Bland, a
Presbyterian minister who serves the
United Campus Christian Ministry at
Stanford.
"In our view, the recent action of
the trustees to vote to sell $9,900
worth of stock in a company which
failed to meet Stanford's Committee
on Investment Responsibility (C-IR)
guidelines is an insult to the entire
community and to all those struggling
to end apartheid in South Africa,"
the scholars state in the letter.
"The sum suggests unmistakably
that the leadership of the University
is insensitive to the moral passions
which have, so properly, driven stu
dents, faculty and staff to raise this
issue. .. . Better almost to have done
nothing."
The C-IR, a special body founded
by the trustees to allow student and
faculty input into the University's in
vestment decisions, had earlier rec
ommended the board divest its
$500,000 worth of shares in Dia
mond Shamrock Petroleum and $3.5
million in Schlumberger, Ltd. as well
as the holdings in Newmont Mining.
The trustees have suspended action
against Shamrock, pending the com
pany's promise to dispose of its inter
ests there and will continue to review
the "overall policies and perfor
mance" of Schlumberger. The board
also voted to review the University's
selective divestment policy early in
1987.
Rosenberg echoed Rebholz'
remarks concerning the purpose of
the protest, stressing the importance
of "indicating to students that in fact
there are a group of faculty who care
about the issue."
Most of the 14 faculty members
who formulated the letter advocate
total divestment of University hold
ings, he said, adding the group has
discussed raising the issue before the
Academic Council this fall.
