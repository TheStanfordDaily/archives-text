I he Blow Monkeys — "Animal
Magic"
"Why doesn't anyone ever listen to
KZSU?"
"Why doesn't anyone ever listen to
KZSU?"
"Why doesn't anyone ever listen to
KZSU?"
The Blow Monkeys, obviously, are
a band that no one has ever heard
about. So how do they manage to sell
records when they're unknown? By
the oldest trick in the book: stealing
other people's styles. They go
through more artists in 40 minutes
than rock 'n' roll has been able to
come up with in 30 years.
Each particular style is represented
for anywhere from a few seconds to a
whole song: Sade; Earth, Wind and

Fire; Lionel Richit; Aztec Camera:
Dylan; Beatles; Hendrix; Spandau
Ballet; Sha Na Na; Squeeze; Smiths;
you name it. "Animal Magic" is just
chock full of other bands' styles.
That's why it's such a great dollar
value.
But wait! Who's missing from the
above list? That's right. The Blow
Monkeys managed to forget their
own style, which we don't know, be
cause this is their first album. From
what we can guess, their "real" style
incorporates syrupy strings, jazz un
dertones, tres romantique vocals and
vaguely Christian spiritual lyrics.
The trouble is that an original style
which actually managed to squeak
through all those big names would be
chopped up beyond recognition by
overproduction and cutesy backing
vocal glitz. If the Monkeys are gonna
steal other people's styles, they may
as well do it without including all that
useless sonic Christmas wrapping.
Icehouse — "Measure For Measure"
"How old is the truck that ASSU
Recycling uses?"

"How old is the truck that ASSU
Recycling uses?"
"How old is the truck that. .. . ?"
"Measure For Measure'' is this
Australian band's fourth album.
Icehouse's first two records, the first
under the band name Flowers, and
the second as Icehouse, gave listeners
some reason to hope for good things
out of the group, led by lead singer
Iva Davies. Davies' songs were remi
niscent of Roxy Music and carried
along with a strong melody line and
vocals eerier than, but often similar
to, Brian Ferry's. "We Can Get To
gether" and "Street Cafe'" were very
good songs that earned them some.at
tention.
Icehouse's previous release,
however, saw them move closer to a
commercial sound, and Davies' lyrics,
always remarkably pointless, acted as
enough deadweight to sink the whole
thing. Well, the new album is no bet
ter. Lyrically, it's still awful, with
songs like "Baby, You're So Strange"
— in w/hirh the above phrase is

repeated upwards of 20 times.
Musically, the sound is more akin
to Asia now than Roxy Music, and
Davies' voice is no longer a comple
ment, but instead an extra layer
added to the fluff cake. And once
again, a promising, innovative hand
lays an egg.
Brian Eno — "More Blank Than
Frank"
"Where are all the DU's gonna live if
they didn't draw?"
"Where are all the DU's gonna live if
they didn't draw?"
"Where are all the DU's gonna live if
they didn't draw?"
"Where are all the DU's gonna live if
they didn't draw?"
Brian WHO?
Yes, believe it or not, that's the
response we get from insiders who
ask what's getting reviewed this
week. Apparently, people don't know
who Brian Eno is.
Well, Brian Eno is art, man. Wow.
His name's not Art, and his music

wasn't meant to be art, but it came
out that way. Bands like Talking
Heads and Roxy Music and King
Crimson ended up using it. Even new
wavers like Devo and the B-52's and
U2 have benefitted from his produc
ing talents. Artistic guy, Brian.
Back in the early '70s, after he left
Roxy Music, Eno managed to put out
four albums full of artsy, rockin' art
rock. After that, his influence began
to show up in other bands' styles, and
he moved on to ambient space-age
elevator music. No one remembers
what happened after that.
So now no one knows who he is ex
cept for you smart-aleck art-school
rejects out there reading this, thinkin'
you're so darned worldly. Yeah, well,
just remember who, between you and
us, writes this column.
But we digress. Nowadays no one
knows who Eno is, and his label was
getting worried about all the back
copies of his earlier, better records, so
they released this, a pretty compre
hensive compilation of his earlier
rockin' stuff. This is nothing close to
Eno's latter-day ambient instrumen

tals — several tracks would have gone
unnoticed on the Quake if it hadn t
been bought out last year by fascist
intellectuals. Others would fit on
Roxy, or Crimson, or Waylon Jen
nings records. Others just don't fit
anywhere.
The bottom line of all this is if
you're the type of person who says,"I
like all kinds of music," just put your
money where your mouth is, and buy
this. You'll be surprised and im
pressed with how clever musicians
were 10 years ago, even with their
bell-bottoms and mood rings.
However, more artsy types who
flee from "greatest hits" releases
should stick to Eno's great original
records. And skeptics that want to
know what "More Blank Than
Frank" really sounds like, instead of
reading all our irrelevant comments,
should look for a real review in a
magazine written by professionals.
