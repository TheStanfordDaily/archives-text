# Dead show: Frosted freaks fall on The Farm

Backyard shows. / know where to go. Been so long 1 felt
this way, I'm in no hurry, no. . . . How long since you felt
this way, at Stanford? How long since Hoover Tower
overlooked a big green bowlful of Frosted freaks? How
long since the Farm witnessed such a massive non-violent
movement against solid-colored garb? It's been a long
year. Deadheads.
There's nothing like a Dead show to bring you elbow
to-elbow with the fellow members of your student body.
People you'd never expect show up. Cruisin' the Dead,
wearing their closet tie-dyes.
Skeptics: "I don't know what the big deal is. It's just a
concert." Converts: "The Dead changed my life. Really.
Well, maybe it was the drugs." Oldtimers: "Yeah, I used
to be into them." First timers: "When are they gonna play
a song?" Contrary to popular opinion, there are Dead
heads at Stanford. After the weekend before last, there
are still more.
So what's so special about the Dead? The music? The
crowd? The vibes, the lore? Hey, like, it's the experience.

Phil says it this way: "When the Grateful Dead is happen
ing, it happens to everyone in attendance, band and audi
ence. So, in a sense, we're all playing in the band." It's
better than group sex.
The music? Electric blues with a current of Day-Glo.
No, they never do the same show twice. How could they?
The band plays about three hours' worth of music, most of

it free-form jamming. Their set lists are spontaneous per
mutations of the some hundred tunes they know, includ
ing many Garcia-Hunter originals and covers of standard
blues numbers. The Frost shows proved that any Dylan
tune is now fair game for the Dead. (So when are they
gonna play "All Along the Watchtower"?)
Dancing with strangers. It's not just dancing, it's sharing
your freest moments with people you don't know (but will
see again, sometime). Slamdancing with the love crowd?

Yup, even Deadheads get the urge these days. Best of all,
of course, is bumping into your friends. It's a party!
The Dead outshone the sun. Hot. Who expected
"Weather Report Suite?" Bill (one drummer), a Paly
High grad, certainly earned an honorary Master of Arts in
congas. Is Mickey (other drummer) human or Vulcan?
Toying with the sophisticated computer-generated

rhythms, he seemed a veritable Spock at the controls.
Brent (keyboardist) wrenched hearts with a soulful blues
piece, and continues to bolster the Dead's compelling a
cappellas.
Bob strummed with such wired fingers that he broke a
string before the concert began, and he rallied the crowd
for several sing-along tunes. Even Phil sang (a mighty
"Quinn the Eskimo" and "Gimme Some Lovin'" carried
Sunday's show on sheer vocal momentum). His bass

rumbled, emerging from an awesome drum jam into a tor
rid "The Other One." And if the thunder don't get you,
then Jerry's guitar will. His lead was mind-expanding; his
dark eyes, founts of giddydom. The Fat Man was there and
rocking like crazy.
And you can take it all home. There are tapers at every
concert, recording the music, applause and comments of
the crowd. The Dead don't mind; tapes don't compete
with their record sales, since they cut their last disc six
years ago. So find a taper, get his or her address, send
tapes, and you can relive the finest moments. Is it Dead or
is it Memorex?
Deadheads with foresight had friends tape the show
from the radio. (KZSU broadcast the concert live, at 90.1
megahertz.) Those with cash bought T-shirts, jewelry,
bumper stickers and other artifacts at the "Dead Mart"
across the street from Frost.
So. What is and always will be the real rivalry between
Stanford and Berzerkeley? Not football, basketball or
baseball. Not academic ratings, not even professors'
salaries. The question is; Where would you rather see the
Dead? Frost or The Greek? Our vote's divided. Got an
extra ticket?
