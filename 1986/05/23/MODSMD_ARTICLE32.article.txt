The Innocents (1%1)
U'C. Theatre, Berkeley
Deborah Kerr gives a stunning
performance as Henry James'
acutely sensitive governess in this
adaptation (by William Archibald
and I ruman Capote) of "The Turn
of the Screw": she preserves the am
biguity of the character, who is
either a woman blessed with second
sight or a repressed spinster prone
to fits of hysteria. Jack Clayton di
rected this memorable, frightening
film, one of the very best of the

"literary" adaptations. Freddie
Francis did the prodigious photogra
phy, Wilfred Shingleton was art
director, and the possibly haunted
children are played to horrifying
perfection by Pamela Franklin and
Martin Stephens. With Megs
Jenkins. Peter Wyngarde and Mi
chael Redgrave, in a fine cameo as
the children's cynical, detached
uncle and guardian.
Plays Thursday with "The Haunt
ing."

The Gods Must Be Crazy (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Do people love this picture be
cause the comedy is
lowest-common-denominator bur
lesque (really primal — sub-Three
Stooges stuff) under the guise of po
litical satire? The writer-director
photographer-editor, Jamie Uys,
seems to know what he's doing
when there's no one on the screen
but his charming bushman hero, Ki,
and a baboon or an elephant, but
the moment other human beings
show up his routines (and
camerawork) become so crude
you'd swear he'd never seen a
movie. Marius Weyers, as the
biologist in the Kalahari Desert who
falls apart when he's around a beau
tiful woman, dominates most of the
film, and he's appalling. (It's not
merely that his timing is bad: he has
no apparent sense of humor at all.)
The storyline has someting to do
with his romance with a trans
planted urban schoolteacher, with
desperate rebels taking hostages,
and with Ki's efforts to get rid of a
Coca-Cola bottle dropped from a
passing plane onto his tribe, and
which he considers a lunatic, bur
densome gift from the gods. (Hence
the title.) The target of Uy's satire is
obvious — a confused (mostly
white) urban society.
Plays Sunday night.
Power (1986)
Memorial Auditorium
This inane attempt at muckraking
moviemaking tries to tell us that —
surprise! — politics is all high
powered show-biz, and that candi
dates are so much processed and

packaged meat, usually serving their
own interests. Any movie starring
Richard Gere has to be very careful
when it calls the game of imagemak
ing foul; Gere is all surface flash,
and he brings no depth or interest to
his character's shallowness. He plays
a media consultant who's juggling
four candidates at once, in elections
in various parts of the Western
Hemisphere. The movie spends its
time chasing after him, showing us
the manipulations and power
grabbing that go on "behind the
scenes." Yet no one we see in this
movie is more manipulative and su
perficial than the filmmakers them
selves, who take their notions of
truth and morality from daytime
soap operas, and their idea of muck
raking exposes from Geraldo
Rivera. Sidney Lumet directed with
much misapplied zeal, from a
screenplay by former journalist
David Himmelstein. With Gene
Hackman (trapped in yet another
bad movie), Julie Christie (ditto), E.
G. Marshall (as a venerable "good"
senator), Beatrice Straight (simply
awful as the senator's wife), Kate
Capshaw and Denzel Washington.
Plays Monday night.
After Hours (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Martin Scorcese's efforts to get
back to a simpler style of
moviemaking resulted in this small,
entertaining comedy, written by film
student Joseph Minion. It's a relief
to see real people in a Scorcese film
again, and with this movie he's once
again grounding his movie effects
for his audience, after a string of
alienating, "personal" films. "After

Hours" starts off whizzing, and
quickly hooks up Paul (Griffin
Dunne, as a staid computer
programer) and Marci (Rosanna
Arquette, as a flighty Soho
denizen); he's invited to her place
and inadvertently becomes involved
with various Soho crazies and their
night-life. The story is a fevered
dream about his attempts to get
home, and it has a built-in limita
tion: as Paul becomes more single
minded in his attempts to escape,
plot development stops and the
movie becomes single-minded in its
efforts to keep him on the run. Not
much is revealed about Paul's char
acter, and Dunne doesn't suggest
much depth, but the filmmakers face
a bigger problem; how to resolve
their Kafkaesque nightmare without
destroying the mood. The last quar
ter or so of the movie seems
labored. With Linda Fiorentino,
Teri Garr and John Heard, as three
of the most engaging and enjoyable
nutsos.
Plays tonight with "Desperately
Seeking Susan" and "Pink Floyd:
The Wall."
The Money Pit (1986)
Century 10, Mountain View
Yet another case of "Steven
Spielberg presents . . . ", this time
with director Richard Benjamin fall
ing into the Spielberg money pit.
The story, about a couple who buy
their dream house only to find it col
lapsing around their ears, has about
enough plot for a modest, 1940s
style domestic comedy, but the pro
duction design is so ludicrously
over-scaled that it becomes the butt
of its own joke, and the title of the

movie takes on a whole new
meaning. Tom Hanks and Shelley
Long struggle gamely with the
David Giler screenplay, but they
don't make much of an impression.
Benjamin stages each episode of a
bathtub or sink or chimney falling
through the floor as if it were the
newest and funniest of gags, and
most of the movie grinds along
relentlessly. Alexander Godunov
has some funny moments as Long's
perfectly self-centered ex-husband.
Plays this week.
Mishima (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Writer/director Paul Schrader
talks a great movie, but he has yet to
direct an even decent one.
"Mishima" is stuck with the stale
concepts we've seen in some of
Schrader's past follies, overblown
with an even greater self
importance and pretentiousness, for
now he's treating the life of a major
writer. The Yukio Mishima
Schrader chooses to present func
tions only as an extension of the
director's own obsessions, so we get
his favorite themes of repressed
sexuality and its metamorphosis into
violence, homoeroticism, self
destructive urges, bureaucratic
oppression, etc., all filtered through
condensed, highly stylistic render
ings of three of Mishima's novels.
The movie is like a "Bad Ideas of
Paul Schrader" primer, and it's in
sufferable. With an uncomfortable
looking Ken Ogata, Kenji Sawada,
Yasosuke Bando and Toshiyuki
Nagashima. In Japanese.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence."

four candidates at once, in elections
in various parts of the Western
Hemisphere. The movie spends its
time chasing after him, showing us
the manipulations and power
grabbing that go on "behind the
scenes." Yet no one we see in this
movie is more manipulative and su
perficial than the filmmakers them
selves, who take their notions of
truth and morality from daytime
soap operas, and their idea of muck
raking exposes from Geraldo
Rivera. Sidney Lumet directed with
much misapplied zeal, from a
screenplay by former journalist
David Himmelstein. With Gene
Hackman (trapped in yet another
bad movie), Julie Christie (ditto), E.
G. Marshall (as a venerable "good"
senator), Beatrice Straight (simply
awful as the senator's wife), Kate
Capshaw and Denzel Washington.
Plays Monday night.
After Hours (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Martin Scorcese's efforts to get
back to a simpler style of
moviemaking resulted in this small,
entertaining comedy, written by film
student Joseph Minion. It's a relief
to see real people in a Scorcese film
again, and with this movie he's once
again grounding his movie effects
for his audience, after a string of
alienating, "personal" films. "After

Hours" starts off whizzing, and
quickly hooks up Paul (Griffin
Dunne, as a staid computer
programer) and Marci (Rosanna
Arquette, as a flighty Soho
denizen); he's invited to her place
and inadvertently becomes involved
with various Soho crazies and their
night-life. The story is a fevered
dream about his attempts to get
home, and it has a built-in limita
tion: as Paul becomes more single
minded in his attempts to escape,
plot development stops and the
movie becomes single-minded in its
efforts to keep him on the run. Not
much is revealed about Paul's char
acter, and Dunne doesn't suggest
much depth, but the filmmakers face
a bigger problem; how to resolve
their Kafkaesque nightmare without
destroying the mood. The last quar
ter or so of the movie seems
labored. With Linda Fiorentino,
Teri Garr and John Heard, as three
of the most engaging and enjoyable
nutsos.
Plays tonight with "Desperately
Seeking Susan" and "Pink Floyd:
The Wall."
The Money Pit (1986)
Century 10, Mountain View
Yet another case of "Steven
Spielberg presents . . . ", this time
with director Richard Benjamin fall
ing into the Spielberg money pit.
The story, about a couple who buy
their dream house only to find it col
lapsing around their ears, has about
enough plot for a modest, 1940s
style domestic comedy, but the pro
duction design is so ludicrously
over-scaled that it becomes the butt
of its own joke, and the title of the

movie takes on a whole new
meaning. Tom Hanks and Shelley
Long struggle gamely with the
David Giler screenplay, but they
don't make much of an impression.
Benjamin stages each episode of a
bathtub or sink or chimney falling
through the floor as if it were the
newest and funniest of gags, and
most of the movie grinds along
relentlessly. Alexander Godunov
has some funny moments as Long's
perfectly self-centered ex-husband.
Plays this week.
Mishima (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Writer/director Paul Schrader
talks a great movie, but he has yet to
direct an even decent one.
"Mishima" is stuck with the stale
concepts we've seen in some of
Schrader's past follies, overblown
with an even greater self
importance and pretentiousness, for
now he's treating the life of a major
writer. The Yukio Mishima
Schrader chooses to present func
tions only as an extension of the
director's own obsessions, so we get
his favorite themes of repressed
sexuality and its metamorphosis into
violence, homoeroticism, self
destructive urges, bureaucratic
oppression, etc., all filtered through
condensed, highly stylistic render
ings of three of Mishima's novels.
The movie is like a "Bad Ideas of
Paul Schrader" primer, and it's in
sufferable. With an uncomfortable
looking Ken Ogata, Kenji Sawada,
Yasosuke Bando and Toshiyuki
Nagashima. In Japanese.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence."

The Innocents (1%1)
U'C. Theatre, Berkeley
Deborah Kerr gives a stunning
performance as Henry James'
acutely sensitive governess in this
adaptation (by William Archibald
and I ruman Capote) of "The Turn
of the Screw": she preserves the am
biguity of the character, who is
either a woman blessed with second
sight or a repressed spinster prone
to fits of hysteria. Jack Clayton di
rected this memorable, frightening
film, one of the very best of the

"literary" adaptations. Freddie
Francis did the prodigious photogra
phy, Wilfred Shingleton was art
director, and the possibly haunted
children are played to horrifying
perfection by Pamela Franklin and
Martin Stephens. With Megs
Jenkins. Peter Wyngarde and Mi
chael Redgrave, in a fine cameo as
the children's cynical, detached
uncle and guardian.
Plays Thursday with "The Haunt
ing."

The Gods Must Be Crazy (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Do people love this picture be
cause the comedy is
lowest-common-denominator bur
lesque (really primal — sub-Three
Stooges stuff) under the guise of po
litical satire? The writer-director
photographer-editor, Jamie Uys,
seems to know what he's doing
when there's no one on the screen
but his charming bushman hero, Ki,
and a baboon or an elephant, but
the moment other human beings
show up his routines (and
camerawork) become so crude
you'd swear he'd never seen a
movie. Marius Weyers, as the
biologist in the Kalahari Desert who
falls apart when he's around a beau
tiful woman, dominates most of the
film, and he's appalling. (It's not
merely that his timing is bad: he has
no apparent sense of humor at all.)
The storyline has someting to do
with his romance with a trans
planted urban schoolteacher, with
desperate rebels taking hostages,
and with Ki's efforts to get rid of a
Coca-Cola bottle dropped from a
passing plane onto his tribe, and
which he considers a lunatic, bur
densome gift from the gods. (Hence
the title.) The target of Uy's satire is
obvious — a confused (mostly
white) urban society.
Plays Sunday night.
Power (1986)
Memorial Auditorium
This inane attempt at muckraking
moviemaking tries to tell us that —
surprise! — politics is all high
powered show-biz, and that candi
dates are so much processed and

packaged meat, usually serving their
own interests. Any movie starring
Richard Gere has to be very careful
when it calls the game of imagemak
ing foul; Gere is all surface flash,
and he brings no depth or interest to
his character's shallowness. He plays
a media consultant who's juggling
four candidates at once, in elections
in various parts of the Western
Hemisphere. The movie spends its
time chasing after him, showing us
the manipulations and power
grabbing that go on "behind the
