## Card opens regional with 11-1 route 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
STILLWATER, Okla. — Lee Plemel had
Appalachian State hitters standing flat
footed for most of nine innings last night —
allowing a run on eight hits — and his Stan
ford teammates ran wild on the basepaths as
the Cardinal routed the Mountaineers 11-1
in a first round Midwest Regional game
here.
With its win, Stanford, the No. 2 seed in
the tournament, earned the right to play
Arkansas in a winners' bracket game tonight
at 6 p.m. PST. Arkansas beat Oregon State
4-3 yesterday afternoon.
In another first-round game here at
Reynolds Stadium, Oklahoma State, the
country's fourth-ranked team according to a
recent Baseball America poll and far and
away the tournament favorite, cruised past
Richmond, 20-8.
Oklahoma State plays Appalachian State
today at 10 a.m. PST in this six-team,
double elimination tournament. Richmond
and Oregon State meet this afternoon at 2
p.m. PST.
The lone survivor of this regional, one of
eight such tournaments around the country,
will advance to the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb., May 28-June 2.
Plemel, who upped his season mark to 7-3
with his third straight complete-game win,
made it look easy.
Through the first three frames, he surren
dered only a scratch infield single in the first.
"We didn't know much about these
guys," the sophomore righthander said.
"We knew they were a home-run hitting
club coming in," said Plemel about an ASU
team which had hit 89 home runs in its 52
previous games and, moreover, carried a
.340 team batting average into Stillwater.
"In the first couple of innings, they
showed they were a tree-swinging team,"
Plemel said. " And I tried to take advantage
of that."
Plemel kept ASU's hitters guessing with a
mixture of off-speed pitches and a sneaky
fastball.
"When he's (Plemel) getting his curveball
over for strikes, he's real tough," said Frank
Carey, who played shortstop behind Plemel.
"Tonight he was painting the black with it."
Catcher John Ramos, who called the sig
nals for Plemel, saw it much the same way.
"He kept them off balance all night . . .

made them swing at his pitch, the curveball.
I don't think these guys had ever seen a
curve like it."
The Mountaineers, baffled by Plemel's
repertoire of pitches, hit only three balls
hard all night.
In the bottom of the fourth, third
baseman Lawrence Sluder stroked an
opposite-field homer to left center to ac
count for ASU's only tally. Tommy Green
and pinch-hitter Lee James later smacked
bases-empty singles, but they didn't amount
to much.

That was about it for the Mountaineer.
Four of the other five ASU hits never left
the infield while the other, a fifth-inning
ground single by Green, skipped under
Carey's glove intocenterfield.
While the Mountaineers did little more
than spin their wheels, Stanford shifted into
high gear in the top of the second. With two
outs, no score and runners on second and
third, Carey lined a clutch two-RBI single
into left center off ASU starter and loser
Lenny Stratton, whose record fell to 9-1
with the loss.

"Frank's .hit was a big one," Stanford
centerfielder Mark Davis said afterward.
"His hit let us know that we were OK. It
kind of broke the ice."
More like opened the floodgates. Given a
lead, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess let his
troops run wild.
"With a lead, it's a lot easier to do all
those things like steal and hit and run," said
Marquess, who is in his I Oth year as Stan
ford's coach. "It's a big part of our game."
Ruben Amaro drew a leadoff walk in the
third, stole second and scored Stanford's
third run on Ramos' soft line drive base hit
to center.
In the fifth, the Cardinal sent 10 men to
the plate and scored six times to turn the
game into a laugher.
After Stratton walked Mark Machtolf and
Amaro, it was off to the races. A double
steal put runners on second and third.
After the dust settled, Davis drilled a two-
RBI double past third and into the leftfield
corner. That made it 5-1, Stanford.
Another walk, this one to Ramos set the
stage for a repeat of Marquess' pet play.
Once again, double steal.
"That's our type of baseball — we're
going to run on anybody," said Marquess,
whose team has swiped 18 1 bases this year.
Davis scored from third on Toi Cook's
bouncer to short.
Then Stanford made a pleasant departure
from its jackrabbit style of play, oddly, it
was Harris — the biggest jackrabbit of them
all, what with a team-high 43 steals, but only
one home run to show for over 200 at bats
— who did the honors.
Harris lashed Stratton's 2-1 offering (a
pitch that turned out to be Stratton's last of
the evening) over the left centerfield wall for
a three-run dinger.
By then it was Stanford nine, ASU one,
and time to make dinner reservations.
The Cardinal added two more scores in
the ninth — on a pair of singles, a wild pitch,
a walk and an error — to produce the 11-1
final.
Card notes
Stanford, which stole nine bases against
California in its last regular season game of
the year almost two weeks ago, wound up
with eight thefts yesterday.

"We didn't know much about these
guys," the sophomore righthander said.
"We knew they were a home-run hitting
club coming in," said Plemel about an ASU
team which had hit 89 home runs in its 52
previous games and, moreover, carried a
.340 team batting average into Stillwater.
"In the first couple of innings, they
showed they were a tree-swinging team,"
Plemel said. " And I tried to take advantage
of that."
Plemel kept ASU's hitters guessing with a
mixture of off-speed pitches and a sneaky
fastball.
"When he's (Plemel) getting his curveball
over for strikes, he's real tough," said Frank
Carey, who played shortstop behind Plemel.
"Tonight he was painting the black with it."
Catcher John Ramos, who called the sig
nals for Plemel, saw it much the same way.
"He kept them off balance all night . . .

made them swing at his pitch, the curveball.
I don't think these guys had ever seen a
curve like it."
The Mountaineers, baffled by Plemel's
repertoire of pitches, hit only three balls
hard all night.
In the bottom of the fourth, third
baseman Lawrence Sluder stroked an
opposite-field homer to left center to ac
count for ASU's only tally. Tommy Green
and pinch-hitter Lee James later smacked
bases-empty singles, but they didn't amount
to much.

That was about it for the Mountaineer.
Four of the other five ASU hits never left
the infield while the other, a fifth-inning
ground single by Green, skipped under
Carey's glove intocenterfield.
While the Mountaineers did little more
than spin their wheels, Stanford shifted into
high gear in the top of the second. With two
outs, no score and runners on second and
third, Carey lined a clutch two-RBI single
into left center off ASU starter and loser
Lenny Stratton, whose record fell to 9-1
with the loss.

"Frank's .hit was a big one," Stanford
centerfielder Mark Davis said afterward.
"His hit let us know that we were OK. It
kind of broke the ice."
More like opened the floodgates. Given a
lead, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess let his
troops run wild.
"With a lead, it's a lot easier to do all
those things like steal and hit and run," said
Marquess, who is in his I Oth year as Stan
ford's coach. "It's a big part of our game."
Ruben Amaro drew a leadoff walk in the
third, stole second and scored Stanford's
third run on Ramos' soft line drive base hit
to center.
In the fifth, the Cardinal sent 10 men to
the plate and scored six times to turn the
game into a laugher.
After Stratton walked Mark Machtolf and
Amaro, it was off to the races. A double
steal put runners on second and third.
After the dust settled, Davis drilled a two-
RBI double past third and into the leftfield
corner. That made it 5-1, Stanford.
Another walk, this one to Ramos set the
stage for a repeat of Marquess' pet play.
Once again, double steal.
"That's our type of baseball — we're
going to run on anybody," said Marquess,
whose team has swiped 18 1 bases this year.
Davis scored from third on Toi Cook's
bouncer to short.
Then Stanford made a pleasant departure
from its jackrabbit style of play, oddly, it
was Harris — the biggest jackrabbit of them
all, what with a team-high 43 steals, but only
one home run to show for over 200 at bats
— who did the honors.
Harris lashed Stratton's 2-1 offering (a
pitch that turned out to be Stratton's last of
the evening) over the left centerfield wall for
a three-run dinger.
By then it was Stanford nine, ASU one,
and time to make dinner reservations.
The Cardinal added two more scores in
the ninth — on a pair of singles, a wild pitch,
a walk and an error — to produce the 11-1
final.
Card notes
Stanford, which stole nine bases against
California in its last regular season game of
the year almost two weeks ago, wound up
with eight thefts yesterday.

Lee Plemel turned in a masterful nine-inning performance in the opening round of the
NCAA Midwest Regional last night. The Stanford sophomore surrendered only a solo
home run in going the route for an 11-1 victory over Appalachian State.
STILLWATER, Okla. — Lee Plemel had
Appalachian State hitters standing flat
footed for most of nine innings last night —
allowing a run on eight hits — and his Stan
ford teammates ran wild on the basepaths as
the Cardinal routed the Mountaineers 11-1
in a first round Midwest Regional game
here.
With its win, Stanford, the No. 2 seed in
the tournament, earned the right to play
Arkansas in a winners' bracket game tonight
at 6 p.m. PST. Arkansas beat Oregon State
4-3 yesterday afternoon.
In another first-round game here at
Reynolds Stadium, Oklahoma State, the
country's fourth-ranked team according to a
recent Baseball America poll and far and
away the tournament favorite, cruised past
Richmond, 20-8.
Oklahoma State plays Appalachian State
today at 10 a.m. PST in this six-team,
double elimination tournament. Richmond
and Oregon State meet this afternoon at 2
p.m. PST.
The lone survivor of this regional, one of
eight such tournaments around the country,
will advance to the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb., May 28-June 2.
Plemel, who upped his season mark to 7-3
with his third straight complete-game win,
