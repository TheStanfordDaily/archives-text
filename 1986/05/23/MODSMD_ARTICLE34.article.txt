# Batsmen look for revenge

### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
STILLWATER, Okla. — Revenge
in tonight's winners' bracket matchup
between Stanford and Arkansas
would indeed be sweet, but it's not
really what the Cardinal players are
thinking about.
"It's been so long," Stanford
catcher John Ramos said after his
team pounded Appalachian State 11 -
1 in a first-round game of this six
team, double elimation Midwest
Regional.
What happened so long ago?
Well, it was nearly a year ago, in
Omaha, Neb., at the 1985 College
World Series that Arkansas, the same
school Stanford confronts tonight,
handed the Cardinal its second loss of
the tournament, 10-4, abrubtly end
ing Stanford's season.
"You don't want to go out there
thinking revenge," said Ramos, a
junior. "You want to play your game
and not get caught up in all that other
stuff."
Sounds good enough. It must be
noted, though, that there are some
very eerie similarities between
tonight's game and last year's.
For one, the site: It's baseball in
the Midwest.
Then there's the time: The last
time these teams met, they played un
der the lights. They'll use lamps again
tonight.
And the pitcher: Ken Campbell, a
mountain of a man at 6-foot-4, 215
pounds, won last years showdown.
He and his 5-6 record and 5.19 ERA
take the mound again tonight.
With all that, it's tough not to
reflect back to last year.
"They're a good team, we learned
that last year," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "I remember they
gave us a real good whupping last
year, but we've got to forget that."
Marquess will send his ace
righthander, Jack McDowell, 10-4 on
the year, to the mound against
Arkansas. The Razorbacks, who rank
16th in the country in the latest
Baseball America poll and beat
Oregon State 4-3 yesterday, boast a
43-15 overall record.
"We've Jack Mac on the hill to
morrow," Stanford senior Mark
Davis said. "I'm not too worried;
we're in good shape."

Yeah, but it's Arkansas, remem
ber?

Walt Harris' game is speed, as evidenced by his team-leading 43 steals
this season, but last night the swift leftfielder hit a three-run home run.
