STILLWATER, Okla. â€” Revenge
in tonight's winners' bracket matchup
between Stanford and Arkansas
would indeed be sweet, but it's not
really what the Cardinal players are
thinking about.
"It's been so long," Stanford
catcher John Ramos said after his
team pounded Appalachian State 11 -
1 in a first-round game of this six
team, double elimation Midwest
Regional.
What happened so long ago?
