Dynasty than the Bugs Bunnny
Road Runner Hour.
Stanford's players had dozed
through the cartoons yesterday
morning, but they stirred for the
later prime-time matches.
Playing in the first and second
rounds of the NCAA Men's
Championships against opponents
from such college tennis power
houses as Furman, Kalamazoo
College, Weber State and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, the Card
inal entrants struggled both with
their own concentration and their
upstart foes.

Stanford seniors Dan Goldie
and Jim Grabb were awake

apiece and move into the round of
16 in the singles. But a South
Carolina roadrunner pushed Stan
ford sophomore Patrick McEnroe
off the cliff.
Furman's super-surprised,
super-athlete Ned Caswell
knocked McEnroe out of the
singles field with a 6-2, 5-7, 6-3
victory yesterday. The unheralded
Caswell then went on to upset
fourth-seeded Kelly Jones of Pep
perdine in the second round 3-6,
6-3, 7-6 (10-8).
In the first round of the doubles
draw, Goldie and Grabb teamed
up to outclass Paul Landry and

downing Weber State's Jonas Ehrlin 6-4, 7-6 and John Zahurak of
Maryland 7-6, 4-6, 7-5.
