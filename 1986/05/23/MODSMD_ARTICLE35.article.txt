ATHENS, Ga. — Here in Ath
ens it's easier to stay awake during
Dynasty than the Bugs Bunnny
Road Runner Hour.
Stanford's players had dozed
through the cartoons yesterday
morning, but they stirred for the
later prime-time matches.
Playing in the first and second
rounds of the NCAA Men's
Championships against opponents
from such college tennis power
houses as Furman, Kalamazoo
College, Weber State and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, the Card
inal entrants struggled both with
their own concentration and their
upstart foes.

Stanford seniors Dan Goldie
and Jim Grabb were awake
enough to record two victories
apiece and move into the round of
16 in the singles. But a South
Carolina roadrunner pushed Stan
ford sophomore Patrick McEnroe
off the cliff.
Furman's super-surprised,
super-athlete Ned Caswell
knocked McEnroe out of the
singles field with a 6-2, 5-7, 6-3
victory yesterday. The unheralded
Caswell then went on to upset
fourth-seeded Kelly Jones of Pep
perdine in the second round 3-6,
6-3, 7-6 (10-8).
In the first round of the doubles
draw, Goldie and Grabb teamed
up to outclass Paul Landry and

Jim Grabb advanced into the NCAA "sweet 16" yesterday by
downing Weber State's Jonas Ehrlin 6-4, 7-6 and John Zahurak of
Maryland 7-6, 4-6, 7-5.
Bob Zoller of Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo 6-2, 6-4. Stanford's second
doubles team of McEnroe and John
Letts advanced to the second round
by defeating Clemson's Matt
Frooman and Brian Page for the
second time this week, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3,
6-3.
"We didn't play all that well, but
we won," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said afterwards, "and I'll take
the wins in this tournament."
After the ultimate high of winning
the team championship on Tuesday,
getting up for the individuals was a
rough task for the Cardinal players.
"There's a tremendous emotional let
down after winning the team compe
tition — it's a very draining thing,"
Gould said. "Any way you look at it,
though, we did play alright today. I
think we'll play better tomorrow."
Goldie and Grabb started the day
with Scooby Doo and company —
both had 8 a.m. singles matches.
Goldie met Tim Corwin of the Di
vision 111 Kalamazoo Hornets, and
Corwin gave the third-seeded Card
inal senior a bit of a scare. Early in
the match, Corwin used an oddly con
structed racket to pass Goldie
deceptively, but Goldie reached back
and stung the Hornet the rest of the
way to win 7-5, 6-4.
In the second round, Goldie en

countered a similarly named fellow,
Dan Goldberg, of Michigan. The
Wolverine beat the Cardinal in the
first set 7-6 (8-6), but Goldie tore
back to take the second set 6-1. With
Goldie leading 1-0 in the third,
Goldberg was forced to retire due to
a sprained ankle.
"I was just a little tight and wasn't
hitting the ball hard at first, and he
made the match tight," Goldie said.
Grabb's breakfast was Jonas Ehrlin
of Weber State . The Stanford senior
did not lose his serve once and won
the match 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
In the second round, Grabb then
met He-Man of the Universe. Well,
the He-Man of Maryland at least.
Terrapin John Zahurak, who looks
more like the Incredible Hulk than a
tennis player, used his physique to
pound a strong serve at Grabb all af
ternoon.
The two tall men split the first two
sets, and Zahurak was up a break in
the third at 5-3. Grabb responded to
the challenge by breaking the Hulk
twice and winning the last four games
to post a 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-5 victory.
"I kept hustling even when 1 was
not able to break his serve," Grabb
said. "He was getting his serve so
high I couldn't hit through it."
The perseverance paid off.
Perseverance was the surprising
quality of Caswell, who didn't have
any previous experience in an NCAA
tournament. Caswell, who also plays
point guard for the Furman basket

ball team, took it to McEnroe from
the start.
If McEnroe wasn't awake, then
Caswell woke him up in a hurry by
taking the first set 6-3. McEnroe
fought back to take the second set 7-
5, but Caswell put him back to sleep
by knocking him out 6-3 in the final
set.
"McEnroe's got to be tired after
the winning the teams — at least
mentally tired," Caswell said. "I
jumped on him in the first. I think if I
had got behind early I might have got
psyched out."
"Patrick played better than Danny
and Jim, and he lost," Gould said.
"When the guy (Caswell) started to
play a little tight, he couldn't take ad
vantage of it."
Goldie and Grabb didn't start their
doubles match until 5 p.m., and it had
already been a long day. The Card
inal pair sailed through Landry and
Zoller, and it was less of a challenge
than the score indicated.
"I thought we looked pretty good,
except it got a little sloppy in the last
couple games," Gould said.
McEnroe and Letts' doubles match
didn't start until 6:30 p.m., because
Page's singles match went long. In a
first set tiebreaker, the Stanford duo
led 6-4, but lost 8-6. Midway through
the second set, the match was moved
indoors because of darkness, and
McEnroe and Letts took the final two
sets 6-3, 6-3.

Dan Goldie has had that winning look about him lately. Yesterday he won his two singles matches and teamed
with Jim Grabb for a doubles win.
ATHENS, Ga. — Here in Ath
ens it's easier to stay awake during
Dynasty than the Bugs Bunnny
Road Runner Hour.
Stanford's players had dozed
through the cartoons yesterday
morning, but they stirred for the
later prime-time matches.
Playing in the first and second
rounds of the NCAA Men's
Championships against opponents
from such college tennis power
houses as Furman, Kalamazoo
College, Weber State and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, the Card
inal entrants struggled both with
their own concentration and their
upstart foes.

Stanford seniors Dan Goldie
and Jim Grabb were awake
enough to record two victories
apiece and move into the round of
16 in the singles. But a South
Carolina roadrunner pushed Stan
ford sophomore Patrick McEnroe
off the cliff.
Furman's super-surprised,
super-athlete Ned Caswell
knocked McEnroe out of the
singles field with a 6-2, 5-7, 6-3
victory yesterday. The unheralded
Caswell then went on to upset
fourth-seeded Kelly Jones of Pep
perdine in the second round 3-6,
6-3, 7-6 (10-8).
In the first round of the doubles
draw, Goldie and Grabb teamed
up to outclass Paul Landry and

Jim Grabb advanced into the NCAA "sweet 16" yesterday by
downing Weber State's Jonas Ehrlin 6-4, 7-6 and John Zahurak of
Maryland 7-6, 4-6, 7-5.
Bob Zoller of Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo 6-2, 6-4. Stanford's second
doubles team of McEnroe and John
Letts advanced to the second round
by defeating Clemson's Matt
Frooman and Brian Page for the
second time this week, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3,
6-3.
"We didn't play all that well, but
we won," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said afterwards, "and I'll take
the wins in this tournament."
After the ultimate high of winning
the team championship on Tuesday,
getting up for the individuals was a
rough task for the Cardinal players.
"There's a tremendous emotional let
down after winning the team compe
tition — it's a very draining thing,"
Gould said. "Any way you look at it,
though, we did play alright today. I
think we'll play better tomorrow."
Goldie and Grabb started the day
with Scooby Doo and company —
both had 8 a.m. singles matches.
Goldie met Tim Corwin of the Di
vision 111 Kalamazoo Hornets, and
Corwin gave the third-seeded Card
inal senior a bit of a scare. Early in
the match, Corwin used an oddly con
structed racket to pass Goldie
deceptively, but Goldie reached back
and stung the Hornet the rest of the
way to win 7-5, 6-4.
In the second round, Goldie en

countered a similarly named fellow,
Dan Goldberg, of Michigan. The
Wolverine beat the Cardinal in the
first set 7-6 (8-6), but Goldie tore
back to take the second set 6-1. With
Goldie leading 1-0 in the third,
Goldberg was forced to retire due to
a sprained ankle.
"I was just a little tight and wasn't
hitting the ball hard at first, and he
made the match tight," Goldie said.
Grabb's breakfast was Jonas Ehrlin
of Weber State . The Stanford senior
did not lose his serve once and won
the match 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
In the second round, Grabb then
met He-Man of the Universe. Well,
the He-Man of Maryland at least.
Terrapin John Zahurak, who looks
more like the Incredible Hulk than a
tennis player, used his physique to
pound a strong serve at Grabb all af
ternoon.
The two tall men split the first two
sets, and Zahurak was up a break in
the third at 5-3. Grabb responded to
the challenge by breaking the Hulk
twice and winning the last four games
to post a 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-5 victory.
"I kept hustling even when 1 was
not able to break his serve," Grabb
said. "He was getting his serve so
high I couldn't hit through it."
The perseverance paid off.
Perseverance was the surprising
quality of Caswell, who didn't have
any previous experience in an NCAA
tournament. Caswell, who also plays
point guard for the Furman basket

ball team, took it to McEnroe from
the start.
If McEnroe wasn't awake, then
Caswell woke him up in a hurry by
taking the first set 6-3. McEnroe
fought back to take the second set 7-
5, but Caswell put him back to sleep
by knocking him out 6-3 in the final
set.
"McEnroe's got to be tired after
the winning the teams — at least
mentally tired," Caswell said. "I
jumped on him in the first. I think if I
had got behind early I might have got
psyched out."
"Patrick played better than Danny
and Jim, and he lost," Gould said.
"When the guy (Caswell) started to
play a little tight, he couldn't take ad
vantage of it."
Goldie and Grabb didn't start their
doubles match until 5 p.m., and it had
already been a long day. The Card
inal pair sailed through Landry and
Zoller, and it was less of a challenge
than the score indicated.
"I thought we looked pretty good,
except it got a little sloppy in the last
couple games," Gould said.
McEnroe and Letts' doubles match
didn't start until 6:30 p.m., because
Page's singles match went long. In a
first set tiebreaker, the Stanford duo
led 6-4, but lost 8-6. Midway through
the second set, the match was moved
indoors because of darkness, and
McEnroe and Letts took the final two
sets 6-3, 6-3.
