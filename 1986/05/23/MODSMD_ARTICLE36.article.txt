# Stanford junior downs Bowes in straight sets
## Fendick advances to finals 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas — A cautiously
quiet crowd settled in here at the
Penick-Allison Tennis Center yester
day, hoping that local darling Beverly
Bowes of Texas could somehow beat
Stanford's Patty Fendick in the
singles semifinals of the NCAA
Women's Championships.
Hoping. The crowd and Bowes
knew that the streaking Fendick
would be difficult to upend, and their
fears were justified. The Stanford
junior ran her winning streak to 16
matches with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over
Bowes.
Fendick will play for the champion
ship today at 1 p.m. against Trinity's
Gretchen Rush on Center Court.
Bowes was seeded No. 5 in the
tournament — one spot ahead of
Fendick — but she was the definite
underdog heading into yesterday's
match. Fendick had not lost a set in
nine matches here, and the Texas
junior played as if she was scared.
"I haven't lost to her for a long
time," Fendick said after the match.
"Every time I've played her, even
when she's up. she's just waiting for
me to come back."
Bowes was not up very often yes
terday, although Fendick was ad
mittedly a little slow at the beginning
of her match.
"I was pretty up and down," Fen
dick said. "I started off flat. I
managed to win the first couple of
games, and then I got on a roll."
Fendick broke Bowes' serve in four
straight points in the fourth game to
take a 3-1 lead.
The next game saw Fendick blast
her serve by Bowes for an ace and a
service winner. The big serve gave
her a 4-1 advantage.
After breaking Bowes on a 3-3
point, Fendick had troubles with her
own serve. She double-faulted three
times, and Bowes pulled to within 5-
2
"When tension sets in, it's going to
manifest itself someplace," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said, explain
ing Fendick's double-faults.
"My serve has been shaky the last
couple of matches," Fendick said.
"My sides have been sore because of
the way I serve and because I've been
playing so many matches."
Bowes appeared to be back in the
set when she won the first three
points of her serve. But, as she did
Wednesday against USC's Caroline
Kuhlman, Fendick rallied to take the
next four points and the set.
"I try to teach my players that
being down 0-3 is an opportunity,"

Brennan said. "You can say, Tt will
just kill her if I win.' It's like twisting
the knife."
Bowes gave the partisan crowd a
thrill when she broke Fendick in four
points to open the second set.
Fendick, however, calmly broke
back, unleashing a lethal forehand
that left Bowes shaking her head.
Bowes' best opportunity of the
match came when she took a 3 -1 lead
in the set. Fendick appeared to have
strained an abdominal muscle and
had to take a lot off her first serve in
the fifth game.
"She (Fendick) had a real critical
game at 1-3," Brennan said.
Employing a virtual lob serve, Fen
dick was able to win the game to pull
to 3-2.
"That game was amazing," Fen
dick said. "She just choked. Had I
lost that game, she probably would
have won the set."
As it turned out, Fendick won the
game, and even though Bowes won
her next serve to go up 4-2, Fendick
was not worried.
"I was only down one break," she
said. "With her, that's no big deal.
She wasn't aceing me."
Trailing 4-2, Fendick altered her
serve so that the muscle strain would
not be a hindrance. "After a while, I
found a way to serve that didn't
hurt," she said.
Fendick's serve was not only effec
tive in the seventh game, it was un
returnable. Backed by two aces, she
held serve to edge to 4-3 in the set.
"I just out and out went for
broke," Fendick said of the aces.
"You have to have the right feeling to
be able to do it. I tried to toss a little
bit shorter and slam it in."
Brennan explained that an injury
can often make a player's serve bet
ter. "You get very precise and your
timing comes back," he said.
A rattled Bowes lost her serve in
four straight points, and Fendick was
even at 4-4.
"She gets really uptight on her
serve in pressure games," Fendick
said.
"1 can tell when she's kind of
shaky."
"She (Fendick) was poised at that
point to pounce on her," Brennan
said.
Fendick was as loose as could be in
the next game as she once again over
whelmed Bowes with her serve.
Trailing 2-1 in the game, Fendick
hit a service winner and followed it up
with an ace. On the next point, she
followed her serve to the net for a
putaway that gave her a 5-4 lead.
At this point, Bowes could not hide
her frustration. "Once she gets down.

she starts making comments,'' Bren
nan said. "She doesn't really help
heiself.
"She's a ferocious competitor," he
added. "Nobody's'a great loser.
Beverly gets frustrated and
annoyed."
Bowes became even more annoyed
when Fendick called the ball out to
make the score I-1 in the 10th game
of the set.

Two big forehands gave Fendick a
triple match point, and when Bowes
hit the next ball past the baseline
Fendick had captured the match.
After the match, Fendick indicated
that the muscle strain would not af
fect her in today's final.
"She's not letting anything get her
down," Brennan said. "She's really
tough this week."'
