ATHENS, Ga. — From here on out. the
best of the best in college tennis will be
gracing the courts of Henry Field Stadium.
Sixteen singles players and 16 doubles
teams are left, and after today's matches only
the best four individuals and top eight teams
will remain alive.
Six of the top 16 singles seeds were
eliminated yesterday, including second seed
Jay Berger of Clemson, who lost to Texas'
Royce Deppe 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.
Clemson also has had bad luck in doubles,
as the third-seeded Tiger team of Richard
Matuszewski and Brandon Walters lost to Mi
chigan's Jim Sharton and Ed Filer 7-5, 7-6 (8-
6). All of the other eight seeded doubles
teams are still alive.
In singles plav. third-seeded Dan Goldie

plays John Ross of SMU at 11 a.m. EST.
" Dan's playing his old nemesis — they've
been rivals for years," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "They're both pretty solid
players."
The winner of the match will play the win
ner of the match between TCU's Tim Mercer
and Clemson's Matuszewski in the quarter
finals.
Goldie's fellow Cardinal, senior Jim Grabb,
will play the unseeded Deppe also at 11 a.m.
The winner will play either Luke Jensen of
USC or Richey Reneberg of SMU.
In the top bracket's other quarterfinal
matches. No. 1 seed Rick Leach of USC plays
Christian Schultes of Utah, and Brad Pearce
of UCLA faces Robbie Weiss of Pepperdine.
In the third bracket, Stefan Kruger of SMU
meets Robert Jan-Bierens of BYU, and Joey
Blake of Arkansas plays Furman's Ned Cas
well.

In doubles, Goldie and Grabb will face Jim
Cass and Steve Bickham of New Mexico and
the Cardinal team of Pat McEnroe and John
Letts will meet Arkansas' Richard Schmidt
and Tim Siegel.
The big story of the individual tourney so
far is the stunning play of Furman's Caswell.
He upset McEnroe in the first round and then
toppled fourth seed Kelly Jones of Pep
perdine in front of a stadium crowd of 2,063.
Caswell is now the pride of South Carolina
— three TV stations drove down to interview
him after he beat McEnroe. His coach Frank
Caipa, described Caswell in one of the best
quotes of the tourney so far.
"He's like a racehorse — the bigger the
challenge the better the effort," Carpasaid.
For the past three years, the winner of the
singles on Athens' slow courts has been a
backcourt player. Now that Berger, the only
prominent backcourt player among the top

seeds, has been eliminated, the competition is
even more of a free-for-all.
Gould thinks that Matuszewski is the player
to watch now, while Georgia Coach and
tournament host Dan Magill likes the chances
of darkhorse sophomore Weiss.
In the doubles, Jones has won the NCAA
crown the past two years with two different
partners, and this year he's going after it with
freshman teammate Augustine Moreno.
Tourney notes
At the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches As
sociation meetings here this week, some pro
posed rule changes have been tossed around.
First of all, about half of the coaches want to
abandon the no-add scoring system which is
now in place, and go back to regular scoring.
That change could take place next year.
The coaches are also wrestling with the
problem of how to invite 20 teams instead of

the present 16 into the tourney without
lengthening it.
Also, there have been proposals to change
team matches to only three singles and two
doubles, although that is more controversial.
The Cardinal received a recruiting surprise
yesterday as Barry Richards, a high school
senior from Spring, Texas signed a letter of
intent to attend Stanford. Richards was the
Texas high school champion this year.
Now that all of the University of Georgia
entrants have been eliminated, the crowd will
probably be smaller today. School is still in
session, but not many students have come out
to the stadium.
There will be two rounds of singles today
and a round of doubles. Tomorrow the semis
in singles will be played, along with the quar
terfinals and semis in doubles. ESPN will
broadcast both the singles semis tomorrow
and the finals Sunday at 3 p.m. PST.
