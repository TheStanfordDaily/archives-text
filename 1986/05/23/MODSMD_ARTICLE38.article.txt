# Montgomery adds second coach
## Huston returns to Pac-10 after spending last four years at Wyoming 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
Denny Huston is one doctor who still makes
house calls.
The 44-year old graduate of Western Washing
ton who earned his doctorate from Washington
State doesn't call on patients, though, he calls on
basketball recruits, and he was recently tabbed to
join Barry Collier as an assistant on Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery's staff.
The first sickness Huston will attempt to cure is a
trend among West Coast high school stars to attend
East Coast colleges. With the commitments of
Hacienda Heights' Scott Williams to North
Carolina and Los Angeles product Stevie
Thompson to Syracuse, the exodus has reached
epidemic proportions.
"We can't let that happen," Huston said of the
West Coast talent drain. "Right now. Coach Davis'
regime left us some great files. They did the
groundwork for the junior class."

Huston also hopes to use Stanford's academics as
a tool to keep West Coast products at home.
"I think we have to use the academics at Stan
ford as a positive thing," he said. "Let's sell it. It's
not a liability. Our job is to find the athlete that can
fit the lifestyle here."
Huston, who spent 1 1 years with Marv
Harshman at Washington and the last four seasons
on the Wyoming staff, will be involved with more
than just recruiting.
"Barry and 1 are co-coaches," Huston said. "As
we look at it, right now we'll share all aspects (of
coaching). Every assistant that's worth his salt
wants to be a head coach. Any time you have an
opportunity to be involved in all aspects that makes
you a better coach."
"What we have are two first assistants,"
Montgomery said. "As time goes on, each person's
strengths will become more evident."
Many factors went into Huston's decision to
leave a Wyoming program which won two Western
Athletic Conference titles and made the finals of

the National Invitational Tournament during his
time there.
"Number one, Mike Montgomery. Number two,
Barry Collier. Number three, a great institution
that they have at Stanford." said the former coach
of the Icelandic National Team.
Huston boasts a strong coaching pedigree,
having worked under the highly regarded
Harshman at Washington and with Jim Branden
burg at Wyoming.
"I was real happy that we were able to attract
Denny," Montgomery said. "When I set out to hire
assistants, I wanted to get the best possible ones,
and I think I did. He understands the total game,
(and) he's a good people person. I think his back
ground will be a tremendous asset to Stanford Uni
versity."
Huston is on campus and is currently in the
process of trying to locate a home for his family,
which includes his wife Joan and three children, if
he "can find a place bigger than this room (his of
fice) that's not over $185,000."
