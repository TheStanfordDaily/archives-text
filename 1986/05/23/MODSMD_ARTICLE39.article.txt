## 
### 
A 15-5 victory in the champion
ship game of the North American
Women's Lacrosse Association
Pacific Coast Championship
capped off a successful weekend
for the Stanford women's lacrosse
club. It also avenged an earlier
11-6 tourney defeat and two losses
in the regular season at the hands
of Seattle.
En route to the title game, the
Cardinal knocked off club squads
from Berkeley, UC-Santa Barbara
and Orange County, scoring what
Stanford's Justina Ray called "all
decisive victories."
"Goals were scored by almost
everyone," Ray said, while noting
"exceptional attack perfor
mances."
Stanford also had to overcome

the loss of Nina Houghton and
Alicia Doyle to injuries, but other
members of the Cardinal com
pensated for their absence.
"Our goalie, Holly Stone,
deserves special mention," Ray
said.
"We will miss our many seniors
who are leaving," Ray said. "But
(we) are looking forward to an
other great season next year."
The Cardinal's second team was
not so fortunate, as it was disquali
fied for using players on the first
team's roster. The squad still
managed to beat Oregon, Western
Washington and Lewis and Clark.
Team No. 2, according to Ray,
"had some exceptional games, and
the consensus was that they would
have won their division."
