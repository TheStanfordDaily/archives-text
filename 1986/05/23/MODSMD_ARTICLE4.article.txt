# Arms panel discusses proper paths to peace
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
A panel of experts last night offered diverse
and conflicting paths to world peace ranging
from establishing a world government to pursu
ing more cultural and economic exchanges by
private citizens.
These exchanges fall into citizen diplomacy, a
program in which citizens bypass bureaucratic
roadblocks and tiy to improve the relationship
between nations.
This approach is superior to more conven
tional attempts at achieving and maintaining
world peace, Michael Shuman from the Center
for Innovative Diplomacy said at last night's
panel discussion in Kresge Auditorium.
Shuman criticized proponents of military
buildups for deterrence and arms control
negotiations, citing the fact that after 40 yeans,
arms control has failed to bring world peace.
Both solutions "deal with technical issues

taking away from the fundamental issue â€”
trust," he said.
"Citizen diplomacy is less Utopian than arms
control or 'Star Wars,' " he said.
Citizen diplomacy includes organizing infor
mal gatherings of political leaders. These have
been successful in the past, Shuman said, citing
the example of the Dartmouth Conference that
led to the creation of several signed treaties, in
cluding the Hotline Agreement.
In addition to these meetings, citizen
diplomacy calls for private citizens to travel to
the Soviet Union and increase the flow of infor
mation with the United States.
Along with this spreading of information
comes improved relations between the two na
tions, he said.
"Citizen diplomacy is easy to understand,
and most of all, it's fun," Shuman said, calling
for the 40 members of the audience to become
involved.

But David Bernstein, a member of the Center
for International Security and Arms Control
here at Stanford, said he did not "see why
(Shuman) considers arms control negotiations
and citizen diplomacy mutually exclusive."
" Arms control performs a function that is ab
solutely vital," Bernstein said.
Although arms control will not bring lasting
world peace, it does help us avoid nuclear war,
he said.
"I endorse a variety of methods for achieving
world peace, but I am also in favor of pursuing"
ways to ensure our survival until those attempts
prove successful, he said.
One of those methods is a proposal for world
government, endorsed last night by Robert
Gauntt of the World Federalist Association.
Gauntt warned against focusing only on
United States and the Soviet Union. "This is a
global issue," he said.
A world government would solve the prob

lem of how do you ensure that a nation won't
use nuclear weapons in order to avoid losing a
conventional war, he said.
The world federalist government would in
clude courts, laws and peace-keeping forces. Nu
clear weapons and military actions would be
outlawed, solving the current arms race, he said.
The government is based on the principle for
individual accountability, he said.
In the case of Libya, for instance, individuals
responsible for terrorist activities would be ar
rested, sparing innocent lives taken as a result of
attacking with military forces, he said.
This solution may be decades away, but work
on drafting a constitution could begin anytime,
Gauntt said.
The last speaker at the event, Robert Con
quest, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,
offered no solutions to the problems hindering
world peace but agreed with many of the con-
