# Final will be test of long-time rivals
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas â€” The
scenario could not be any more
familiar for today's singles final
here at the NCAA Women's
Championships.
Stanford's Patty Fendick and
Trinity's Gretchen Rush, two of
the sport's biggest rivals, will meet
for the last time in college today
on Center Court at the Penick-
Allison Tennis Center.
"I'm just psyched I'm in the
finals," Fendick said yesterday
after defeating Texas' Beverly
Bowes 6-2, 6-4 in the semifinals.
"But I don't want to be satisfied
with that."
Stanford Coach Frank Biennan
probably would have been some
what dissatisfied had Fendick not
made the finals. Only once in his
seven years at Stanford has he
failed to place a player in the
singles championship.
Last year, the Cardinal's Linda
Gates knocked off Rush to
capture the title. In order for Stan
ford to bring home the crown
again, Fendick will have to beat
Rush, whom she has never before
defeated.
"Every time I've played her
before, I never thought I could
win," Fendick said. "If I can just
block out who I'm playing, I'll be
fine. This year, I've managed to
tune out who I'm playing."
Fendick came closest to beating
Rush last year in the semifinals of
the national championships. She
led 4-1 in the third set before

losing 3-6, 6-4, 7-6.
Though she has never beaten
Rush, Fendick may have several
advantages today.
The Stanford junior had never
defeated USC's Caroline
Kuhlman prior to this week. But
Kuhlman has fallen twice in the
past five days to Fendick.
"Kuhlman's three times better
than Gretchen," Fendick said.
Fendick might also be more
rested than Rush. Both have
played a lot of matches in the last
week, but Rush played two
doubles matches yesterday after
noon.
"It's going to be a good match,"
Fendick said. "I just hope she's
more tired. It's just going to come
down to who wants it more.
"I think I'm getting better at
playing more matches in a shorter
period of time," she added.
The pressure factor could be a
burden on Rush, the No. 2 seed.
She has lost in the finals the past
two seasons, and, as a senior, this
is her last chance.
"Patty should be nice and
loose," Brennan said. "She's a
junior."
"If you want to get technical,
she has all of the pressure," Fen
dick said.
Yet, while this is Rush's final
opportunity, Fendick wants to win
just as badly.
"I think it's easy for me to say
there's no pressure," Fendick said.
"This would be a perfect time to
beat Gretchen. It's her last
chance."
