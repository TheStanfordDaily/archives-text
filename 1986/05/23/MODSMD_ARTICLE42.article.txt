# University employee shatters world mark
## 
### 
A new world record was set Wed
nesday by a Stanford employee.
Tom Mcßann, who is involved in
athletic department marketing and is
the ultimate frisbee team adviser,
threw a Skyro (a predecessor of the
Aerobie) 1,298 feet.
It was the longest throw of any ob
ject in history and broke Mcßann's
own record of 1,114-6 set last year.
He has held the mark since 1979
when he threw an object 726 feet in
San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.
Mcßann had planned his attempt
for the record and made the toss in
the Great America parking lot in
Sunnyvale.
Mcßann elected to throw the
Skyro rather than the popular
Aerobie because the Skyro is "harder
to control but goes farther."
Of the conditions for his demon
stration, Mcßann said "there was a
good wind to work with."
