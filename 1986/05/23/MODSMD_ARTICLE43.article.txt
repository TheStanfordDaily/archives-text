# Stanford looks to claw its way up from the conference cellar

### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
It'll be one step at a time for the Stanford men's
track team.
For the last couple of years the Cardinal has been
consistent at the Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships — consistently last. At this weekend's cham
pionship meet at USC, the team should improve on
those lowly finishes.
The Pac-10 is the toughest track conference in
the nation, and until next year, when Stanford will
be bolstered by some new recruits and some impor
tant redshirts, a top-five finish is probably out of
the question.
"You become humbled when you look at a team
like Cal who is so good and will probably only
finish fourth or fifth in this conference," Stanford
Asst. Coach Dave Wollman said.
"We have the points to get out of the 10th spot.
Even if everything goes wrong, we should be better
than ninth," he said.
Better than ninth may not sound like much, but it

would be a step in the right direction for the Card
inal, whose strength comes out better in a national
meet in which depth isn't so important.
"We'll beat a lot of these teams at NCAAs, but
for now we'll be happy with doing the best that we
can do," Wollman said.
As it's shaping up, the meet should turn into
three distinct battles. UCLA and Washington State
will battle for first, while USC, California and
Oregon should round out the top five and move up
if either of the top two falters.
Arizona, Arizona State and Stanford will vie for
the next three spots.
The Cardinal got an unexpected bonus when
senior Jay Thorson placed fourth in the decathlon,
which was completed Tuesday. Thorson tallied
7,293 points, a new personal best which also
qualified him for the NCAAs.
The mark was surprising because it was Thor
son's first complete decathlon in more than three
years. No one will be able to beat Washington's
Mike Ramos, who set a new NCAA record in the
competition, but Wollman thinks that Thorson

could be a surprise place-winner for the Cardinal at
the NCAAs.
After the decathlon, Stanford is in fourth place, a
position 'it won't hold, but if the team is to stay
close it will need big points from the distance run
ners and a couple of field events.
Brian Marshall will be involved in a three-way
battle with Arizona's Maurice Crumby and
UCLA's Troy Haines in the high jump. In the dis
cus, Stanford's entrant is freshman Glenn
Schneider, who Wollman says is a competitor
"mature beyond his years." Schneider could place
fifth or sixth.
Jeff Atkinson, Ryan Stoll, Christian Skoog,
Charles Alexander and James Albourough could
all score in the distance races. Just how high they
score will determine Stanford's finish.
"We've got most of our money on the distance
runners; they're really the key," Wollman said.
Skoog, who just last week missed the NCAA
qualifying mark in the 800 by a scant .14 of a
second, will be running primarily to win, but a qual
ifying time would be an appreciated bonus.
