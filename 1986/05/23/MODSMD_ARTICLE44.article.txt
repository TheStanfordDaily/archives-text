# Downtown stadium still a controversy

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
The pressure is on San Francisco
Giants owner Bob Lurie to sup
port Mayor Dianne Feinstein's
plan for a new downtown baseball
stadium after Board of Super
visors President John Molinari's
challenge to Lurie Wednesday.
Molinari, who has championed
the mayors $36 million proposal
on the board, said he will not sup
port a bond issue to pay for the
stadium without a promise from
the Giants that they will play in
the new park.
But Lurie and Corey Busch,
Giants vice-president for adminis
tration, said earlier this week the
plan — and the money to pay for it
— are not satisfactory enough to
gain their support.
"I cannot carry a bond issue un
less we have a tenant. We have to
deal with the Giants," Molinari

said.
He said he plans introduce a
resolution at next week's super
visors meeting to place a $12 mil
lion bond issue for the mayor's
plan on the Nov. 4 citywide ballot.
"The voters are not going to
vote for any bond issue unless
there's a major tenant," he said.
Feinstein's plan js to build an
open-air, baseball-only stadium at
Seventh and Townsend Streets in
the downtown on 14.5 acres of
land owned primarily by the Santa
Fe Pacific Realty Corp. The ball
park would seat 42,000.
Lurie has repeatedly said in the
past that he will not keep the
Giants in the windy and aging
Candlestick Park on the southern
edge of San Francisco. He has said
he will move the team to another
city if a better ballpark is not pro
vided.
