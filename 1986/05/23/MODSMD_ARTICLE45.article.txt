Radicals storm meeting in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Two thousand right-wing ex
tremists stormad a provincial city hall last night, breaking up a meeting
of South Africa's ruling National Party in a violent protest against the
government's proposed political concessions to blacks.
The two-hour melee forced the cancellation of the Nationalist rally in
Pietersburg, 210 miles northeast of here, where Foreign Minister Roelof
Botha wits to have argued the government's case for political "power
sharing" with the country's black majority. Police finally used tear gas to
drive members of the ultra-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
wearing their swastika-like emblems, from the Pietersburg city hall and
the surrounding streets, but not before ARM members had beaten many
of the National Party supporters, ripped party posters and flags from the
walls and threatened to assault Botha if he appeared.
Eugene Terre'Blanche, leader of the Afrikaner Resistance Move
ment, had already been hoisted by his followers onto the auditorium
stage. Standing defiantly in the place where Botha was to have spoken,
he declared that the group's triumph in Pietersburg would contribute to
the fall soon of the Nationalist government and then to the establish
ment of an all-white Afrikaner state.
The action by the white-supremacist group, regarded only a year ago
as of little political consequence, dramatized the growing backlash
among South Africa's conservative whites over the country's continuing
racial unrest and their resistance to any changes, however minimal and
gradual, in the apartheid system of racial separation and minority white
rule.
Both the National Party and the Afrikaner Resistance Movement had
seen the Pietersburg rally as key test of strength following the disruption
of a similar Nationalist meeting last month and Terre'Blanche's boasts
that Botha would not be allowed to speak. The victory of the
ultrarightists thus was a clear humiliation for President Pieter Botha's
government, which has always depended on the support of the Dutch
descended Afrikaners.
Reagan affirms support for Habib
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration, addressing
"confusion in other quarters," yesterday reaffirmed its support for a
comprehensive and enforceable Central American regional peace treaty
and for President Reagan's special Central American envoy, Philip
Habib.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes told reporters that "the posi
tion of the United States has remained constant" through a hailstorm of
critical position papers, letters of advice and expressions of alarm from
conservatives and the Pentagon that has intensified as prospects of a
treaty-signing have increased.
He rejected a demand from Rep. Jack Kemp, (R-N.Y.), that Habib be
recalled and replaced in order to avert "a diplomatic disaster" at the so
called Contadora treaty talks, which enter a crucial stage this weekend.
In a letter to Reagan, Kemp charged that Habib's "confusing
maneuvers and conflicting explanations potentially set the stage for a
new Central American Yalta," a reference to the 1945 treaty among the
United States, the Soviet Union and Great Britain that laid out terms of
the postwar East-West balance in Europe.
Conservatives began to worry after Habib promised in a recent letter
that U.S. aid to Nicaraguan anti-government rebels, known as contras,
or counterrevolutionaries, will end "on signature" of an acceptable Con
tadora pact, if it is honored by the leftist Sandinista government of
Nicaragua. The conservatives have argued forcefully in recent days that
Nicaragua cannot be trusted to honor any pact and that contra aid must
not cease.
150 casualties in Beirut shelling
BEIRUT, Lebanon — More than 150 persons, mostly civilians, were
reported killed or wounded yesterday in the Lebanese capital as the
army and rival militia factions launched their heaviest shelling attacks
this year.
First casualty reports said at least 28 persons were killed and 86 others
wounded in the teeming districts of southern Beirut, inhabited mostly by
Shia Moslems. Six persons were killed and 25 others were injured in
mostly Christian East Beirut.
Moslem and Christian religious leaders postponed indefinitely a
planned reconciliation meeting as opposing factions accused each other
of indiscriminate shelling. Cease-fire agreements collapsed one after the
other.
Lebanese President Amin Gemayel, who recently indicated his readi
ness to come to terms with Syria, was reported by reliable sources to be
probing the possiblity of Soviet participation in ending the 11-year-old
Lebanese civil war.
Israeli: Waldheim could be charged
JERUSALEM — Israeli Justice Minister Yitzhak Modai said here
yesterday that there was enough evidence to charge former U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim for complicity in Nazi crimes during
World War 11.
Modai said on radio that investigations by the Israeli Justice Ministry
had concluded that if Waldheim were in Israel, there would be grounds
for putting him on trial for complicity in criminal acts.
The Israeli minister's remarks were a reference to Waldheim's role as
a lieutenant in the German army in Yugoslavia and Greece. But the
World Jewish Congress in March accused Waldheim of the repression of
involvement in Yugoslav partisans and the deportation of Greek Jews to
death camps, which Waldheim denies.
After those accusations, Israel became one of the countries seeking
U.N. documents on war crimes. Austria, where Waldheim is running for
president, also received such documents, but after a study of them,
Austrian President Rudolf Kirschschlaeger said he felt the evidence was
not sufficient to put Waldheim on trial.
Kurds claim victory against Iraq
AMMAN, Jordan — Kurdish insurgents trying to carve out an auton
omous region in Iraq are claiming their most important victory in 25
years in fighting that threatens the already hard-pressed Iraqi govern
ment with closure of a vital international highway and oil pipeline near
the Turkish border.
Masud Barzani. son of Mustafa Barzani, who led three major revolts
against Iraq before his death in 1979, made the victory claim in a recent
interview in Damascus. Barzani is the 39-year-old leader of the Kurdish
Democratic Paity.
The reported fighting would indicate that Barzani's forces, backed by
Libya and especially Iran, were stepping up operations in the north of
Iraq as part of a strategy to draw Iraqi troops away from the southern
and central fronts where they face major concentrations of Iranian
troops in the now almost six-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
Argentina breaks ties with S. Africa
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — In a sharp exchange of notes, Argen
tina broke diplomatic relations with South Africa yesterday, calling the
Pretoria regime "a threat to peace and international security."
The Argentine decision left Brazil as the only major South American
democracy to continue relations with Pretoria. It followed South African
rejection of an Argentine protest against attacks earlier this week on
Botswana. Zambia and Zimbabwe.
