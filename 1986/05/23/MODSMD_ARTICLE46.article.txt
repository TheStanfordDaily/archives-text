## House approves foreign trade bill 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday over
whelmingly approved a far-reaching Democratic
hill to toughen laws against unfair trade practices
and force other countries to reduce "excessive"
trade surpluses with the United States.
The bill carried by a 295 to 115 margin, enough
to override an almost certain veto, and was sent to
the Senate, which is expected to consider a tough
trade package of its own. The bill got 236 votes
from House Democrats, with only four voting
against it.
Despite heavy Administration pressure, 59 Re
publican legislators — largely from states with in
dustries that have been hard hit by imports —
voted for the bill, which President Reagan
denounced as "anti-trade" and "rankly political."
"This protectionist legislation would have our
nation violate the most basic tenents of free and
fair trade," Reagan said in a speech to the Ameri

can Retail Federation minutes before the House
vote.
"Indeed, it would plunge the world in a trade
war, eroding our relation with our allies and free
world trading partners. Economic growth in
America would be the casualty."
Nonetheless, Minority Whip Trent Lott ( R-
Miss.) deserted his party to vote for the bill, as did
all but two Republicans from New England, 13 of
20 Republicans from Pennsylvania and Ohio and
the entire GOP delegation from North Carolina.
The key provisions of the bill would force the
president to act against unfair trade practices of
other nations with either quotas or tariffs. The
president could retain some flexibility, however, by
declaring it would be against the nation's economic
interests to take trade action.
The bill also expands the definition of unfair
trade practices to include other nations' targeting

of specific American industries for export drives,
and the cut-rate sale of natural resources such as
timber and oil to domestic industries.
It also requires retaliation against countries that
bar sales of American telecommunications prod
ucts.
The most controversial part of the bill, an
amendment sponsored by Rep. Richard Gephardt
(D-Mo.) is aimed at Japan, Taiwan and West Ger
many, which would be required to reduce their
trade surpluses by 10 percent a year starting in
1987 if they refuse to end what are considered un
fair trade practices.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) who broke through rivalries among House
Democrats to get the 458-page bill to the floor,
said the measure "sends a historic message that the
United States will no longer stand by and watch
American industry be replaced by foreign indus
try."
