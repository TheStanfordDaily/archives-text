# NATO endorses chemical-weapons plan
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium — NATO
defense ministers yesterday endorsed
a set of alliance military plans that
cleared the way for the United States
to produce a new generation of
chemical weapons despite persistent
objections from several allies.
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger hailed the decision to
adopt about 1,500 "force goals" as a
major step toward strengthening the
conventional defense of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. He
also sought to play down complaints
expressed by several European allies
who did not want to see the United
States break the 17-year moratorium
on the production of nerve gas.
The U.S. Congress has stipulated
that new funds will be appropriated

for the chemical weapons only if the
allies give their approval and join
consultations about deployment
plans. The legislation was passed
after many congressmen contended
that it makes no sense to produce
chemical weapons if the European
allies would never permit their use on
their territory.
Modern binary weapons consist of
two harmless chemicals that become
lethal nerve gas only when they are
mixed together. They would replace
an estimated 30 tons of aging chemi
cal weapons in the U.S. stockpile over
the next decade.
Weinberger said, "some member
nations expressed unhappiness about
the idea of chemical weapons and
everybody is against their use." But

he said the United States felt obliged
to modernize its arsenal to gain more
bargaining leverage with the Soviet
Union and the 40-nation Geneva dis
armament conference.
The Geneva negotiations are in
tended to achieve a global ban on
chemical weapons, but the search for
an accord has been stymied by
disputes between Washington and
Moscow over verification methods.
U.S. officials insisted that yester
day's actions by NATO defense min
isters complied with the legal require
ments set forth by Congress to launch
production of the new nerve-gas
supplies. Despite the objections of
several allies, none of those countries
could impose a veto because they are
not empowered to block the force

goals of another N ATO member.
But the fact that at least six allies
expressed varying degrees of opposi
tion to the plan could arouse congres
sional skepticism.
Defense minister's from Norway,
Denmark and the Netherlands voiced
the strongest reservations. They later
said they had explicitly told
Weinberger to inform Congress
about their absolute rejection of new
chemical weapons.
A majority of the ministers who
spoke at yesterday's meeting openly
questioned the wisdom of resuming
the manufacture of new chemical
weapons, NATO sources said. None
volunteered for his country to join
West Germany in deploying the
nerve gas if a military crisis arose.
