SDI cutback demanded
WASHINGTON — In the most severe chal
lenge yet to President Reagan's "Star Wars"
plan, 46 senators yesterday demanded a huge
cutback in the missile-defense effort when the
Senate Armed Services Committee sets money
ceilings on Pentagon programs next month.
The bipartisan coalition called for no more
than a 3 percent after-inflation increase for the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) rather than the
74 percent rise Reagan requested for fiscal 1987,
the budget year starting Oct. 1.
"Our concern," the 46 senators said in a letter
to the Armed Services panel, "is that the Strate
gic Defense Initiative has received excessive and
inappropriate emphasis in the Department of
Defense's budget."
By its size and makeup, the Senate coalition
represents one of the biggest moves against SDI
since Reagan on March 23, 1983, proclaimed it
as an attempt to make nuclear offensive missiles
obsolete. The senators' letter to commitee chair
man Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) and the panel's
ranking Democrat, Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) was
clearly designed to influence committee decisions
on the defense-authorization bill when drafting
sessions scheduled for June 2 begin.
Agent linked to Presser
WASHINGTON — FBI agent Robert
Friedrick, who has been charged with lying to try
to prevent Jackie Presser from being indicted for
labor racketeering, failed a lie detector test four
months ago and then told authorities that he had

met secretly last summer with the Teamsters
chief and Presser's attorney, sources close to the
case said yesterday.
The sources, who spoke on the condition that
they not be named, said that Friedrick removed
sensitive FBI files on Presser without authoriza
tion from his Cleveland office last June and took
them to a hotel where he met John Climaco,
Presser's lawyer. But Friedrick insisted to auth
orities that he did not show the documents to
Climaco.
The meetings and the removal of the docu
ments suggest that Friedrick, one of the agents
who initially argued that Presser should not be
indicted because of his role as a government in
formant. may have had a relationship with the
union leader and his lawyer that went beyond
normal FBI procedure for handling informants.
Friedrick declined comment through his attor
ney.
Benefit hikes may hold
WASHINGTON — White House Budget
Director James Miller indicated yesterday that
the Administration would not oppose congres
sional efforts to give cost-of-living increases to
Social Security recipients, despite the fact that it
appears inflation will not reach the 3 percent
threshold that automatically triggers the hikes
undercurrent law.
Miller's comments made it appear virtually
certain that the increases would be granted.
Denial of next January's inflationary increases, as
the law would allow, would reduce the deficit by
roughly $4 billion this year, if inflation runs at the
2 percent rate that government economists have

forecast.
But few lawmakers relish the prospect of an
gering the nation's 37 million Social Security
recipients during an election year. Both houses of
Congress have anticipated 2 percent increases in
their budget resolutions.
Smoking ban proposed
WASHINGTON—The General Services Ad
ministration yesterday proposed an almost total
ban on smoking in the 6,800 buildings it owns or
leases. The proposal would affect about half of
the government's 2.8 million civilian workers,
and most of the 350,000 employees here.
Because the federal government is the nation's
largest employer, the action could trigger similar
bans in private firms.
Under the plan — scheduled to take effect in
the fall — cigarette, pipe and cigar smoking
would be banned in general office space, iobbies,
hallways, restrooms, elevators, libraries and
classrooms.
Stocks sharply higher
NEW YORK — The stock market rolled up its
sharpest gain in more than a month yesterday,
carrying the Dow Jones industrial average back
over 1,800.
Analysts said there were no dramatic news
developments to account for the rally, which
came on moderate trading volume.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down 8.81 on Wednesday, climbed 31.13 to
1,806.30. That marked the average's best
showing since it rose 38.32 points on April 16.
