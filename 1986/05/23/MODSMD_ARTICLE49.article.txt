UFO spotted nearby
SAN FRANCISCO — More than a dozen
people said they saw a mysterious UFO racing
across the pre-dawn sky north of San Francisco
yesterday — a strange X-shaped craft with blink
ing lights that hovered above the hills of Sonoma
County before speeding away into the dark.
A California Highway Patrol officer who
declined to be named and radio station KTOB
News Director Arlette Cohen were among those
who reported spotting the strange craft at about
4:30 a.m. between the cities of Petaluma and
Sonoma — about 40 miles north of here.
The sighting came on the heels of reports of
pingpong-ball-sized multi-colored UFOs crowd
ing radar screens in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The gov
ernment scrambled jet fighters to intercept the
tiny objects, and two pilots said they saw the ob
jects flying nearby.
"I saw these two white lights to the east,"
Cohen said, estimating the craft was about 1.000
feet in the air. She said she noticed the UFO
when it crossed to the west side of the highway
and "hovered almost stock-still . . . for a few
seconds."
Cohen said she was driving to work at her
Petaluma station, northbound on U.S. 101, and
made the sighting shortly before reaching
Petaluma.
When the craft crossed the highway once
again, she said she saw two "tiny green lights"
glowing faintly on the side opposite the two
bright white lights. She said she could hear no
sound coming from the craft.

"I think I saw sort of a black *X' silhouette
shape," Cohen said. "It was really hard to tell."
"An unidentified object described as a large
orange 'X' with white lights in the front was seen
traveling at a high rate of speed eastbound from
Petaluma," Santa Rosa CHP Officer Bill
McChristian said of the report from the uniden
tified officer and several callers.
San Francisco Bay area air traffic controllers
said they could not explain the sighting, saying
radar screens detected no such object flying over
the area at that time.
Cult killer faces parole
FRONTF.RA — A parole hearing for Charles
Manson follower Leslie Van Houten was
abruptly recessed yesterday after parole board
members conceded they had failed to give her at
torney adequate notice that the hearing was to
take place.
The parole board's hearing representative,
Frank Coronado, conferred with two other panel
members who were to have decided Van
Houten's suitability for parole.
He then announced. "It was the suggestion
that we continue this hearing since we failed to
comply with the statutory provisions."
He asked Van Houten's attorney, Dan
Mrotek, if the prisoner would waive the require
ment for notification 30 days before her hearing.
He said she would not.
Although Mrotek was notified in advance, he
said that another lawyer. Maxwell Keith, who
defended Van Houten at her murder trial, was

not given the required notiee. Keith has attended
several of her previous parole hearings.
Coronado said Van Houten would have a
chance to take her bid for freedom to the parole
hoard again within 60 to 90 days.
Bouvia to swap hospitals
LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles Superior
Court judge yesterday ordered the Los Angeles
County Department of Health Services to trans
fer quadriplegic Elizabeth Bouvia out of a county
hospital in Lancaster, where doctors planned to
discontinue injections of morphine, the painkiller
that Bouvia claims is vital to her comfort.
Judge Jack Newman ordered Bouvia trans
ferred within five days to the L.A. County-
University of Southern California Medical Cen
ter. which had given Bouvia morphine during a
previous stay.
The ruling brought to an end an acrimonious
five-month relationship between Bouvia, who
wants to find a hospital or convalescent home
that will provide her with painkillers while she
starves herself, and the staff of the county's High
Desert Hospital in Lancaster.
