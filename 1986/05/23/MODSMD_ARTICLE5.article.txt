# Postal hours may change
## 
### HUGH BETHELL Staff writer 
There are times when waiting in
line at the Stanford Post Office is a
little like death and taxes: There's
nothing anyone can do about it.
But in a move he hopes will im
prove the post office's service. Station
Manager David Gavino is currently
conducting an informal survey that
could shorten those lines by changing
the station's operating hours.
According to Gavino, the post of
fice could "very easily make some
simple changes in the hours we are
open. We could open earlier and
close earlier, or we could open later
and close later. It really depends on
what the students want."
Other post offices have changed
their hours as the needs of their cus

tomers have changed, Gavino said.
He added that students make up 95
percent of the customers who use the
Stanford station.
In informal conversations with sta
tion customers, Gavino said most stu
dents have suggested the post office
should open earlier.
Gavino said the idea of a morning
jog to the post office is appealing to
many students with whom he has
spoken.
On weekdays, there is a line of six
to 20 people waiting when the post
office opens at 8:30 a.m., Gavino
said.
Gavino said he believes a shift from
the current 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. day to
a 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. schedule
would better suit students' needs.
Gavino said that should the post
office decide to implement the pro

posed changes, a box for Express
Mail pick-up would likely be installed
outside the station. Mail delivery
would remain unaffected as the
changes would apply only to the
hours the main office is open for cus
tomers to send packages, buy stamps
and conduct other business.
However, Gavino stressed the
changes would be implemented only
if the majority of students surveyed
believe the proposed operating hours
would be preferable to the current
schedule. If new operating hours are
favored, the post office will immedi
ately begin a 30-day trial period
before adopting any change perma
nently.
Post office customers who have
opinions regarding the operating
hours can reach Gavino at the station
or by calling 322-0059.
