The Residential Arts Program (RAP) at Stanford is
designed to "use art as a way of raising issues," accord
ing to James Cadena, assistant dean of Student Affairs
and director of the program.
This weekend, RAP, which operates under the aus
pices of the Office of Residential Education, concludes

Feature

its production of "Bent," a play depicting the persecu
tion of gay men and Jews during the early days of the
Nazi Holocaust in Germany.
In the past. Cadena and others have brought "SBM"
and "Spell #7" to Stanford in coordination with the
Drama Dept., Black Performing Arts and Residential
Education. This year the program has adopted its own
name, but the unique consciousness-raising and educa

tional aspects of these productions have remained
Cadena's primary focus.
The previous plays dealt with "the black experience
in this country," but Cadena says he selected "Bent"
because the issues of homophobia and AIDS are im
portant to the Stanford community, as are the experi
ences of those persecuted during the Holocaust.
"Bent," written by Martin Sherman, was a contro
versial play on Broadway. It recreates the personal ex
periences of Max Berber and other men who attempt
to go on with life in Berlin's thriving homosexual un
derground in the 1930s while Jews, homosexuals, poli
tical dissidents and gypsies are being viciously perse
cuted and murdered by the Nazis. "Bent" deals
primarily with the horrendous conditions of the con
centration camps, and specifically the persecution of
gays within the camps themselves.
The powerful themes in the play — "repression.
segregation, ethnocentrism and dis
crimination" — are obviously
relevent today as "we deal with such
current problems as the AIDS
epidemic, apartheid and terrorism,"
said Cadena.
After each production of "Bent,"
audience members participate in a
discussion of the play. These oppor
tunities to share impressions are an
important part of what RAP wants to
accomplish. They are attended by the
cast, production staff and a special
guest expert. Saturday's guest will be
Doug Daher, a staff psychologist at
Cowell.
Rachel Bagby, who handled public
relations for " Bent," said that she has
"brought together people who have
experience in dealing with the
Holocaust and with the concerns of
gay people" to participate in several
forums over the last two weeks. This
combination of the"artistic process
and the educational process," says
Bagby, is what makes RAP a an im
portant program at Stanford.
Stanford students are the actors in
"Bent," and thus far the audience
response has been positive. "People
have been moved by it," said Cadena,
who also noted that one person sent a
personal letter to thank the cast for its
powerful performance.
"Bent" is performed in the Elliott
Program Center at Governor s Cor
ner at 8 p.m. The run ends Sunday.
