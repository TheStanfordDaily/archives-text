# Panel cites religion as one factor in conflicts
## 
### JOHN POLLACK 
Stating that religion can act either to moderate or
exacerbate a conflict, keynote speaker Byron Bland
opened a panel discussion on religious-political conflict
last night in Tresidder's Cypress Lounge.
Bland, organizer of the "International Perspectives
on Peace" lecture series, said his "first assumption"
when examining issues of war and peace is that con
flicts are usually multi-causal in nature.
But in examining wars, "you're going to find a religi
ous conflict" at some point, he added.
Joining Bland on the panel were George Behlmer,
visiting assistant professor of history, and James
Noyes, a Hoover senior research fellow.
Behlmer, speaking on the current religious-political
conflict in Northern Ireland, noted that the religious
enmities and antagonisms that exist in Ireland today
"have resisted change for over 400 years."
Both Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland
have "internalized a long list of stereotypes" about
each other, he said.
Behlmer presented three different analyses of the
conflict. The first theoiy is that the conflict in Northern
Ireland is purely religious in nature. But this analysis
"lacks a lot of explanatory power," he said.
The second view is that the Protestant Ulster
Defense Association and the Catholic Provisional
Wing of the Irish Republican Army "use religion very
cynically to perpetrate old antagonisms and myths," he

said. Groups such as these have a vested interest in
promoting tension because this helps to maintain their
own political power and status.
Behlmer's third theory is that the conflict is
"fundamentally an issue of class." This argument rests
on the thesis that it "is in the interest of the factory
owners" and the owners of large farms to perpetrate
violence, preventing the different groups from recog
nizing that "their interests lie in collaboration."
While acknowledging that he doesn't subscribe fully
to this argument, Behlmer said that he is inclined
toward it.
Relating the issue of religious-political conflict to the
civil war in Lebanon, Noyes said that the current con
flict stems from a dispute over the distribution of poli
tical power among the various religious and ethnic
groups in Lebanon.
The National Pact of 1943, which allocated political
offices to the different religious groups on a system of
fixed quotas, "embedded the access to economic and
political power," said Noyes.
However, these quotas were based on the results of a
1932 census, a census that does not reflect the
demographics of modern Lebanon.
But William Saade, a Ph.D. candidate in engineering
economic systems, disagreed with this analysis.
Saade, a Beirut native, said that the civil war was
largely due to Kamal Jumblatt, a Druze interior mini
ster who enlisted the aid of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in an attempt to secure more power.
