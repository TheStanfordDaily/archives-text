### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
Midnight marked the end of this
week's ASSU special election, which
will determine the ASSU's financial
policy regarding student organiza
tions' funds.
According to Elections Commis
sioner Robin Miller, results will be
posted in the ASSU office at 8 p.m.
tomorrow.

Miller said the small number of
votes cast in this election has made it
impossible for the commission to
issue preliminary results. Since the
overseas ballots can strongly influ
ence the outcome of the election,
definitive results cannot be obtained
until tomorrow, when the overseas
ballots will arrive by mail.
The 200 overseas ballots, added to
approximately 1,000 on-campus

votes cast, will show a turnout of
about 5 percent of the campus popu
lation. Miller said.
While elections officials called this
election "boring," Miller cited the
"incredible degree of administrative
efficiency in the elections commis
sion." Because of the small number
of ballots and the rapidity with which
the election was called and held, Mil
ler said the election process has been
"quick and efficient."
