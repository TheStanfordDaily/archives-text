# Singles titles wrap up Card tennis dominance
## Senior Goldie wins, goes out with style 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — There were six
steps to climb this past weekend to
reach the pinnacle of collegiate men's
tennis, and only one man was going to
reach that peak.
Dan Goldie was that man.
The Stanford senior powered his
way to the top by pummelling a pair
of super sophomores in the semifinals
and finals to become the 1986 NCAA
Men's Singles Champion.
In front of a crowd of 3,428 in
Henry Field Stadium at the Univer
sity of Georgia Sunday, Goldie ut
terly dominated Richey Reneberg of
the SMU Mustangs in the final, 6-2, 6-
I. On Saturday, Goldie had turned in
a blitzkrieg first-set performance and
rolled to victory over UCLA's Brad
Pearce 6-2, 7-6 (7-3).
Reneberg and Pearce were left
reeling in the wake of the Goldie
onslaught.
"Could someone please tie me up
in this chair and push me down the
hill?" Pearce said to a host of
reporters after Goldie had defeated
him in the semis.
"He took control so fast that it
made me tentative right away,"
Reneberg said. "I was on the defen
sive the whole time and never really
got untracked."
Goldie's victory gave Stanford the
honor of being the first school in
NCAA history to win both the men's
and women's team titles and the
men's and women's singles titles in
the same year.
Goldie, who was the only Cardinal
entry in the men's individuals to get

past the quarterfinal rounds, became
the ninth Stanford player to win the
singles championship and the 33rd
from the Pacific-10 Conference.
Stanford senior Jim Grabb was
defeated in the round of 16 on Friday
by Texas' top player, Royce Deppe,
4-6, 7-6(7-5), 6-4.
Both of Stanford's doubles entries
were also eliminated Friday. A tired
Goldie and Grabb team was outlasted
by two unknowns from the University
of New Mexico, Tim Cass and Steve
Bickham, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. The No. 2
Cardinal duo of Patrick McEnroe and
John Letts was eliminated by
Arkansas' Richard Schmidt and Tim
Siegel (who eventually reached the
semifinals) 6-3, 7-5.
McEnroe had been eliminated
from the singles draw on Thursday by
Furman's Ned Caswell.
So, by the time Sunday rolled
around, Goldie was the only Cardinal
left in the tourney. But one was
enough.
Stanford's three-time All-America
senior started the final match off so
strong that most of the crowd was
simply stunned into silence. Goldie
broke Reneberg's first two service
games with rocket returns and easily
held his own with serves that seemed
to be fired from a bazooka rather
than a racket.
Goldie won three out of his four
service games in the first set by 4-0
scores. The only two points Reneberg
was able to win off of Goldie's serve
both resulted from offensive lobs.
There was no other way to pass the
red-hot Cardinal.

Junior Patty Fendick defeated Trinity College's Gretchen Rush for the NCAA women's
tennis title, her 17th straight singles victory.
"He's such a tough guy to pass."
Reneberg said. "He's big and has a
good reach. He hits balls so tlat that
when they hit they really take off."
On the returning side. Goldie
broke Reneberg's serve six out of
eight times, firing winners or deep
returns off of either first or second
serves. The execution took just 55
minutes.
After shaking hands with Reneberg
and the umpire, Goldie was buried in
a bear hug by Stanford Coach Dick
Gould, and the crowd gave the new
champion a standing ovation.
"I just came out tiying to move my
feet, hit the ball hard and stay loose,"
Goldie said afterwards. "I don't think
this is the'best I've ever played but it's
probably one of the best matches I've
played in college. It sure was a great
time to have it."

"He (Goldie)
took control so
fast that it made
me tentative right
away '" -Richey
Reneberg

Although it's a cliche. Goldie did
save his best for last. After being
ranked No. 1 early in the season, he
slid down to around 10th in the latter
half of the year and entered the team
championship with a not-so
impressive 11-7 record. But Goldie
hadn't been losing to nobodies —
seven out of his eight losses had come
at the hands of players ranked in the
top five.
"Dan had a tough year and he
didn't set the world on fire, Gould
s id. "But he never stopped
working."
The work paid off as Goldie helped
Stanford to the team championship

with key wins over Pearce and Pep
perdine's Kelly Jones, hoth of whom
he had lost to in the regular season.
In the individual championships,
Goldie really started to get things
going in his round of 16 match against
SMU's John Ross. The two seniors
split sets on court one and Ross
battled through several controversial
calls by the umpire to send the third
set into a tie-breaker, which Goldie
won 7-3.
"There's nothing I can say. I can't
control what the umpire does —
that's up to him, - ' Ross said after
wards. "Unfortunately 1 didn't get
any breaks. You hope they even out
but they didn't. 1 think Danny is
playing really well right now. He
returns so well — you can hit your
best first serve and he's still danger
ous."
Clemson's Richard Matuszewski,
whose nickname is the Ice Man,
found out just how dangerous Goldie
was later that afternoon in his quar
terfinal match. Goldie took the first
set 6-4 and then completely melted
Matus/.ewski in the second set 6-0.
Before Saturday's semifinal match
against Pearce, Goldie said he wanted
to come out smoking and he did just
that.
Goldie broke Pearce in the Bruin's
first two serving games and had the
first set sewn up before Pearce could
find his game. Goldie then came back
down to earth in the second set but
still won in a tie-breaker 7-3.
"I had a good comeback, but I
wasn't able to sustain it," Pearce said.
"It was more him playing down than
me playing up."
After it was all over on Sunday,
Goldie reflected on his year at Stan
ford.
"The reason I'm in college tennis is
for the team, and my major goal this
year was to win the team title for
Stanford." he said. "This singles tiling
is just a little something extra."
On Sunday. Goldie. Grahb and
McEnroe were ail named to the 1986
Collegiate All-America Team. This is
the third year in a row that Goldie
and Grabb have received the honor
and the first time for McEnroe.

Dan (.oldie completed a 360-degree season Sunday with his 6-2, 6-1 vic
tory in the NCAA men's singles final over SMIPs Richey Reneberg.
After being ranked No. 1 in the nation early in the year, Goldie fell to
around 10th during a midseason slump. The Cardinal senior regained
the top spot, however, with his winning performance in Athens, Ga.
