# Singles titles wrap up Card tennis dominance
## Senior Goldie wins, goes out with style 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. â€” There were six
steps to climb this past weekend to
reach the pinnacle of collegiate men's
tennis, and only one man was going to
reach that peak.
Dan Goldie was that man.
The Stanford senior powered his
way to the top by pummelling a pair
of super sophomores in the semifinals
and finals to become the 1986 NCAA
Men's Singles Champion.
In front of a crowd of 3,428 in
Henry Field Stadium at the Univer
sity of Georgia Sunday, Goldie ut
terly dominated Richey Reneberg of
the SMU Mustangs in the final, 6-2, 6-
I. On Saturday, Goldie had turned in
a blitzkrieg first-set performance and
rolled to victory over UCLA's Brad
Pearce 6-2, 7-6 (7-3).
Reneberg and Pearce were left
reeling in the wake of the Goldie
onslaught.
"Could someone please tie me up
in this chair and push me down the
hill?" Pearce said to a host of
reporters after Goldie had defeated
him in the semis.
"He took control so fast that it
made me tentative right away,"
Reneberg said. "I was on the defen
sive the whole time and never really
got untracked."
Goldie's victory gave Stanford the
honor of being the first school in
NCAA history to win both the men's
and women's team titles and the
men's and women's singles titles in
the same year.
Goldie, who was the only Cardinal
entry in the men's individuals to get

past the quarterfinal rounds, became
the ninth Stanford player to win the
singles championship and the 33rd
from the Pacific-10 Conference.
Stanford senior Jim Grabb was
defeated in the round of 16 on Friday
by Texas' top player, Royce Deppe,
4-6, 7-6(7-5), 6-4.
Both of Stanford's doubles entries
were also eliminated Friday. A tired
Goldie and Grabb team was outlasted
by two unknowns from the University
of New Mexico, Tim Cass and Steve
Bickham, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. The No. 2
Cardinal duo of Patrick McEnroe and
John Letts was eliminated by
Arkansas' Richard Schmidt and Tim
Siegel (who eventually reached the
semifinals) 6-3, 7-5.
McEnroe had been eliminated
from the singles draw on Thursday by
Furman's Ned Caswell.
So, by the time Sunday rolled
around, Goldie was the only Cardinal
left in the tourney. But one was
enough.
Stanford's three-time All-America
senior started the final match off so
strong that most of the crowd was
simply stunned into silence. Goldie
broke Reneberg's first two service
games with rocket returns and easily
held his own with serves that seemed
to be fired from a bazooka rather
than a racket.
Goldie won three out of his four
service games in the first set by 4-0
scores. The only two points Reneberg
was able to win off of Goldie's serve
both resulted from offensive lobs.
There was no other way to pass the
red-hot Cardinal.
