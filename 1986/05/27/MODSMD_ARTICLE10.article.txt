Leaf-blower noise
menaces campus
1 have been somewhat bemused by
the recent outpouring on these pages
of indignation against the protest
shanties outside the president's of
fice. I would grant that they are a
blight on the visual beauty of an
otherwise lovely spot. I would also
grant that it is, perhaps, futile to
protest the existence of ugliness in the
world by creating more of it. But the
ugliness of the shanties affects only a
small corner of a rather large campus,
and the cause is just.
What surprises me most is the
paucity of any similar indignation
against a much more vicious attack on
beauty and serenity, an attack which
affects not one small corner, but the
entire campus. 1 am talking about the
almost continual use of gasoline
engines with no noticeable evidence
of mufflers. The worst, of course, are
the leaf-blowers. These do a very
creditable imitation of a dentist's drill
crossbred with a gas turbine, while
the clouds of dust they raise
generously contribute to the Bay
Area's air pollution index.
The shanties are much less noxious
than the leaf-blowers. First, everyone
knows where the shanties are. If you
happen to feel that you really can't
handle any more ugliness, they are

easy to avoid. The din from the leaf
blowers, however, carries halfway
across campus â€” and it is very hard
to predict when or where they will
erupt. Second, unless you are
troubled by the symbolism of the
gesture, it is easy to turn your eyes
the other way as you pass the
shanties. The nerve-shattering racket
of the leaf-blowers cannot be shut
out.
The daily, almost incessant van
dalism perpetuated against the aural
beauty of the campus, in the name of
a small increment to the visual illu
sion of orderliness, signals a major
victory of eye over ear. And the out
cry over the relatively modest visual
blight of the shanties, contrasted with
the passive acceptance of the un
remitting scream of the engines, com
pels the conclusion that the victory of
eye over ear has been total.

Worker not fired
I am writing in response to com
ments made by Linda Crouse at the
governance forum on Friday, May 9,
and which appeared in the Campus
Report on May 14. Crouse stated that
a food service worker at Florence
Moore Hall had injured his back on
the job and was subsequently dis
charged. She added that he was

treated in a manner inconsistent with
Stanford's Human Resource Philoso
phy.
I have personally talked with key
people in Florence Moore Hall, food
service, my central office staff and the
employee relations office and would
like to clarify the facts presented by
Crouse. The worker whose back was
hurt is not now nor was he ever dis
charged. Prior to the forum, this
worker had been provided a lighter
duty job at the manager's request and
with the concurrance of a co-worker
for a total of six months, one month
beyond the original request. When
his doctor determined that he could
not yet return to the job he was orig
inally hired to do, he was granted a six
month leave of absence and he was
encouraged to apply for disability
benefits (which can be as high as two
thirds of his regular income). He has
been receiving benefits since March
27 and he has also been offered tem
porary work for the summer confer
ence period.
It is the hope of the food service
management that he will be success
ful in finding a permanent job which
will accommodate his limitations. We
will do all we can to assist in this en
deavor. It is my belief that the
Florence Moore manager has been
reasonable and responsive in meeting
the needs of the food service worker.
