# Poverty and conscience
## 
### 
Concern for the homeless, the poor and the imprisoned
in our society usually waits until Christmas time when we
are reminded, by the great communications network, that
the forgotten people still exist. Mixed in with our concern
comes a little compassion, and probably a lot of guilt. We
read that people are dying in the streets, unable to find
housing adequate enough to give them the basic warmth
needed to survive. But our concern rarely lasts past win
ter, for our American short-sightedness comes into play
and convinces us that the situation is better now, or at
least bearable, and we can go back to our own lives happy
and proud that we have felt such compassion and helped
the situation so tremendously.

An American's ability to forget the forgotten people
perhaps really isn't all that incredible. We live in a society
of success and boundless enthusiasm for what life has to
offer. To forget those who have failed, who need some
type of public assistance, is understandable. Why should
our success and happiness be marred by those who have
failed? Public help undermines the very basis of
capitalism: the desire to accomplish, to make money and
then more money, to be successful.
Any look at those who haven't succeeded threatens our
belief in the system. We must rationalize their failure as
something completely separate from what the system is
about. They have been given all the opportunities: if they
have failed, well, better luck next time, we really can't
help.
Nothing really changes. The forgotten people still exist,
and they're still forgotten. We fight daily to keep our lives
in order, to keep chains on our consciences because it
would be so unproductive if they were ever let out, if we
ever really came to know that our society is unjust,
prejudiced and just reinforcing the status quo. If we let
them, our consciences might remind us that perhaps the
$15,000 a year we're paying to Stanford, Inc. could be
better spent elsewhere.
We blind ourselves voluntarily because, like the
racehorse flying down the track to eventual victory, any
distraction in our peripheral range might slow the pace.
Meanwhile, people still freeze to death on the streets.
Perhaps there used to be a society, a Rockwellian com
munity which cared about its failures, its prison inmates,
its mentally ill. Sometime back in the days of Ward and
Beaver and the nuclear family, when people knew each
other by name, when a community was a real community.
But in the vast urban centers of today's America, where
the pace is dizzying and the competition incredibly fierce,
where even the most stable have difficulty withstanding

the pressure, those who fail are easily forgotten, hidden
away in downtown ghettos, in mental hospitals and in
prisons where we don't have to deal with them.
In Greenwich Village last winter, barbed wire was laid
across hot-air grates to keep homeless people from fin
ding any semblance of a home, while in Fort Lauderdale a
city commissioner suggested topping garbage with poison.
In Los Angeles one city official complained because the
prison inmates were being fed twice a day, while he
argued that they deserved to be fed only once.
These are perhaps amazing events, but there should
really be little surprise. Tolerance for failure is supposedly
a high social ideal, compassion a neccessary requirement
for being human, but there is no doubt that such things
cannot come to dominate our mentality to such an extent
that we are sidetracked. Perhaps if one of us is directly af
fected by poverty, by homelessness, perhaps if our own
brother goes to jail, we will listen.
But until then, we are able to abstract the situation, to
exist in the luxury of looking at social problems intellectu
ally and quite distantly, so that we don't have to dirty our
white-gloved hands with the blood of injustice.
The danger posed by the forgotten people, the failures
in our society, are readily apparent. The homeless human
litter marring our beautiful streets is a constant reminder
that urban decay is well underway, that the ideal system
which we call America is not what ideal human society
should really be like.
Likewise, criminals only show us that human nature is
not as manicured and controlled as we — living in our
little dream worlds — would have believed. We fight to
keep control, to lock the failures out of our homes, our
streets and our consciences, deadly intent on maintaining
the control that we expect and require to live a happy,
healthy and productive life.
Our minds convince themselves that the nine million
unemployed, the one million prisoners, the hundreds of
thousands of homeless have been given opportunity, but
have not run with it, have had the torch of equality but
have dropped it. Then the aberrations that some call
people are relegated to the ranks of animals, and public
officials devise new ways to exterminate them.
But there is one more reason why the forgotten people
stay forgotten, why the homeless become just a part of the
litter on the street, the convicts become a part of the proof
of some Hoover fellow's treatise that, indeed, Hispanics
and blacks have more criminal tendencies than whites. It
is too tiring, too much of an upset of the order of our daily
lives, to feel. To feel compassion, or even any desire to
change the status quo, is just too taxing.
Living in the midst of failure shows only that human
beings can fail, that we can fail. Thus it is imperative to
shuttle the failures out of view, to not allow them on our
streets or in our minds because we just don't want to be
reminded. It is too difficult to walk over an immobile,
degenerated body lying on the streets, just as it is too diffi
cult to see poverty and crime, and to be confronted with
the idea that maybe it is just as much our fault that there is
crime as it is the criminal's.

Our minds convince themselves that the nine million
unemployed, the one million prisoners, the hundreds of
thousands of homeless have been given opportunity, but
have not run with it, have had the torch of equality but
have dropped it. Then the aberrations that some call
people are relegated to the ranks of animals, and public
officials devise new ways to exterminate them.
But there is one more reason why the forgotten people
stay forgotten, why the homeless become just a part of the
litter on the street, the convicts become a part of the proof
of some Hoover fellow's treatise that, indeed, Hispanics
and blacks have more criminal tendencies than whites. It
is too tiring, too much of an upset of the order of our daily
lives, to feel. To feel compassion, or even any desire to
change the status quo, is just too taxing.
Living in the midst of failure shows only that human
beings can fail, that we can fail. Thus it is imperative to
shuttle the failures out of view, to not allow them on our
streets or in our minds because we just don't want to be
reminded. It is too difficult to walk over an immobile,
degenerated body lying on the streets, just as it is too diffi
cult to see poverty and crime, and to be confronted with
the idea that maybe it is just as much our fault that there is
crime as it is the criminal's.

Concern for the homeless, the poor and the imprisoned
in our society usually waits until Christmas time when we
are reminded, by the great communications network, that
the forgotten people still exist. Mixed in with our concern
comes a little compassion, and probably a lot of guilt. We
read that people are dying in the streets, unable to find
housing adequate enough to give them the basic warmth
needed to survive. But our concern rarely lasts past win
ter, for our American short-sightedness comes into play
and convinces us that the situation is better now, or at
least bearable, and we can go back to our own lives happy
and proud that we have felt such compassion and helped
the situation so tremendously.

An American's ability to forget the forgotten people
perhaps really isn't all that incredible. We live in a society
of success and boundless enthusiasm for what life has to
offer. To forget those who have failed, who need some
type of public assistance, is understandable. Why should
our success and happiness be marred by those who have
failed? Public help undermines the very basis of
capitalism: the desire to accomplish, to make money and
then more money, to be successful.
Any look at those who haven't succeeded threatens our
belief in the system. We must rationalize their failure as
something completely separate from what the system is
about. They have been given all the opportunities: if they
have failed, well, better luck next time, we really can't
help.
Nothing really changes. The forgotten people still exist,
and they're still forgotten. We fight daily to keep our lives
in order, to keep chains on our consciences because it
would be so unproductive if they were ever let out, if we
ever really came to know that our society is unjust,
prejudiced and just reinforcing the status quo. If we let
them, our consciences might remind us that perhaps the
$15,000 a year we're paying to Stanford, Inc. could be
better spent elsewhere.
We blind ourselves voluntarily because, like the
racehorse flying down the track to eventual victory, any
distraction in our peripheral range might slow the pace.
Meanwhile, people still freeze to death on the streets.
Perhaps there used to be a society, a Rockwellian com
munity which cared about its failures, its prison inmates,
its mentally ill. Sometime back in the days of Ward and
Beaver and the nuclear family, when people knew each
other by name, when a community was a real community.
But in the vast urban centers of today's America, where
the pace is dizzying and the competition incredibly fierce,
where even the most stable have difficulty withstanding

the pressure, those who fail are easily forgotten, hidden
away in downtown ghettos, in mental hospitals and in
prisons where we don't have to deal with them.
In Greenwich Village last winter, barbed wire was laid
across hot-air grates to keep homeless people from fin
ding any semblance of a home, while in Fort Lauderdale a
city commissioner suggested topping garbage with poison.
In Los Angeles one city official complained because the
prison inmates were being fed twice a day, while he
argued that they deserved to be fed only once.
These are perhaps amazing events, but there should
really be little surprise. Tolerance for failure is supposedly
a high social ideal, compassion a neccessary requirement
for being human, but there is no doubt that such things
cannot come to dominate our mentality to such an extent
that we are sidetracked. Perhaps if one of us is directly af
fected by poverty, by homelessness, perhaps if our own
brother goes to jail, we will listen.
But until then, we are able to abstract the situation, to
exist in the luxury of looking at social problems intellectu
ally and quite distantly, so that we don't have to dirty our
white-gloved hands with the blood of injustice.
The danger posed by the forgotten people, the failures
in our society, are readily apparent. The homeless human
litter marring our beautiful streets is a constant reminder
that urban decay is well underway, that the ideal system
which we call America is not what ideal human society
should really be like.
Likewise, criminals only show us that human nature is
not as manicured and controlled as we — living in our
little dream worlds — would have believed. We fight to
keep control, to lock the failures out of our homes, our
streets and our consciences, deadly intent on maintaining
the control that we expect and require to live a happy,
healthy and productive life.
Our minds convince themselves that the nine million
unemployed, the one million prisoners, the hundreds of
thousands of homeless have been given opportunity, but
have not run with it, have had the torch of equality but
