## Respect lesbian and gay lifestyles 
### 
When I was seven years old I fell in love with my
best friend. His name was Roberto. He had dirty
blond hair, cool hazel eyes and an expression that
showed angelic calm. He was shy and quiet, but his
smile was beautiful and his manners soft, and he
spoke to me as if I were the only pereon that mat
tered in his life.
There was nothing I wanted more than to be with
him. I wanted to hold him, to take care of him. I
loved him. And 1 think he loved me, too. But one
day my brother told my mother that Roberto was a
'"sissy." He told her that other kids at school were
calling us bad names. My mother was very upset
and strictly forbade me from talking to Roberto
again.

I couldn't understand why we were being called
names or why people didn't want us to be friends. I
tried very hard to think of wrong things we might
have done, but nothing came to mind. Afraid and
confused. I promised to obey my mother's orders.
That night I cried in bed. know ing I could no longer
be Roberto's friend.
It's taken me many years and a handful of similar
experiences to realize that that night I wasn't crying
only for our friendship. I was also cry ing for myself
as a gay person. For in our culture being
homosexually oriented in any way is considered
aberrant, so that, as gays and lesbians, we are
taught that our feelings are unnatural and that we
have no right to express them.
Fortunately. I have met others who. like me. are
marginalized on the basis of their sexual orienta

tion. With them I have learned to share the hurt,
the frustration and the anger that I harbored
secretly for many years. They have taught me to ac
cept and love myself, and to be strong and stand up
for who I am with pride and dignity.
But not all gay people are as lucky as I have
been. And the truth of the matter is that as les
bians, gays and people of bisexual orientation, we
are continually oppressed within the established
structure.
It is my belief that initially our liberation as
homosexually oriented people can only come about
through awareness. Accordingly, my message
today is directed to those in the Stanford commu
nity who are unaware of our plight and to those
who know what we are about but do not yet sup
port our fight for liberation, or refuse to. To those
of you, I want to present some suggestions that
might help you overcome the ignorance, fear,
hatred or confusion that separate you from the les
bian and gay communities as well as from their
causes as oppressed groups.
• Read about homosexuality. The library of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford at the Old
Firehouse, as well as the major libraries on
campus, contain numerous resources sympathetic
to the homosexual struggle for acceptance and un
derstanding. You can learn about coming to terms
with one's homosexuality, coming out to friends
and parents, lesbian and gay politics, alternative
family lifestyles, lesbian and gay relationships,
bisexuality, safe sex, AIDS and much more.
• Explore your feelings. Find out what your
feelings with regards to homosexuality reflect
about our culture and specifically about your

upbringing. Try to see how those feelings come into
conflict with the experience of lesbians and gays,
and see if there is any way that you can integrate
your lifestyle with those of the lesbian and gay
communities without threatening your integrity
and their well-being.
• Explore your own sexuality. Give yourself the
opportunity to act on your curiosity and carry out
your sexual fantasies. Expand your sexual reality
and be honest in deciding what is and isn't
pleasurable for yourself.
• Invite lesbian and gay speakers to your residence.
Let them tell about their outlooks, their fears, their
passions, their fights and their hopes. Most openly
lesbian and gay students on campus are friendly
and eager to share their experiences with you.
• Be sensitive. Avoid assumptions and expressions
that undermine the option of homosexuality. Give
your lesbian and gay friends space to express them
selves physically, emotionally and politically. Most
importantly, give your friends space to explore
their sexuality and support them as they come to
terms with their own homosexuality.
• Above all, remember that, unless we choose not
to be, lesbians and gays are invisible. You may,
without knowing it. deeply hurt people around you
unless you question your feelings and assumptions
about homosexuality and accept it as a valid and
healthy alternative lifestyle.
1 o this day, my memory of Roberto is filled with
awe and pain. But perhaps being gay does not have
to be painful. The resources are many. You can, by
liberating yourself, help lesbian and gay people
liberate.

liberating yourself, help lesbian and gay people
liberate.

When I was seven years old I fell in love with my
best friend. His name was Roberto. He had dirty
blond hair, cool hazel eyes and an expression that
showed angelic calm. He was shy and quiet, but his
smile was beautiful and his manners soft, and he
spoke to me as if I were the only pereon that mat
tered in his life.
There was nothing I wanted more than to be with
him. I wanted to hold him, to take care of him. I
loved him. And 1 think he loved me, too. But one
day my brother told my mother that Roberto was a
'"sissy." He told her that other kids at school were
calling us bad names. My mother was very upset
and strictly forbade me from talking to Roberto
again.

I couldn't understand why we were being called
names or why people didn't want us to be friends. I
tried very hard to think of wrong things we might
have done, but nothing came to mind. Afraid and
confused. I promised to obey my mother's orders.
That night I cried in bed. know ing I could no longer
be Roberto's friend.
It's taken me many years and a handful of similar
experiences to realize that that night I wasn't crying
only for our friendship. I was also cry ing for myself
as a gay person. For in our culture being
homosexually oriented in any way is considered
aberrant, so that, as gays and lesbians, we are
taught that our feelings are unnatural and that we
have no right to express them.
Fortunately. I have met others who. like me. are
marginalized on the basis of their sexual orienta

tion. With them I have learned to share the hurt,
the frustration and the anger that I harbored
secretly for many years. They have taught me to ac
cept and love myself, and to be strong and stand up
for who I am with pride and dignity.
But not all gay people are as lucky as I have
been. And the truth of the matter is that as les
bians, gays and people of bisexual orientation, we
are continually oppressed within the established
structure.
It is my belief that initially our liberation as
homosexually oriented people can only come about
through awareness. Accordingly, my message
today is directed to those in the Stanford commu
nity who are unaware of our plight and to those
who know what we are about but do not yet sup
port our fight for liberation, or refuse to. To those
of you, I want to present some suggestions that
might help you overcome the ignorance, fear,
hatred or confusion that separate you from the les
bian and gay communities as well as from their
causes as oppressed groups.
• Read about homosexuality. The library of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford at the Old
Firehouse, as well as the major libraries on
campus, contain numerous resources sympathetic
to the homosexual struggle for acceptance and un
derstanding. You can learn about coming to terms
with one's homosexuality, coming out to friends
and parents, lesbian and gay politics, alternative
family lifestyles, lesbian and gay relationships,
bisexuality, safe sex, AIDS and much more.
• Explore your feelings. Find out what your
feelings with regards to homosexuality reflect
about our culture and specifically about your

upbringing. Try to see how those feelings come into
conflict with the experience of lesbians and gays,
and see if there is any way that you can integrate
your lifestyle with those of the lesbian and gay
communities without threatening your integrity
and their well-being.
• Explore your own sexuality. Give yourself the
opportunity to act on your curiosity and carry out
your sexual fantasies. Expand your sexual reality
and be honest in deciding what is and isn't
pleasurable for yourself.
• Invite lesbian and gay speakers to your residence.
Let them tell about their outlooks, their fears, their
passions, their fights and their hopes. Most openly
lesbian and gay students on campus are friendly
and eager to share their experiences with you.
• Be sensitive. Avoid assumptions and expressions
that undermine the option of homosexuality. Give
your lesbian and gay friends space to express them
selves physically, emotionally and politically. Most
importantly, give your friends space to explore
their sexuality and support them as they come to
terms with their own homosexuality.
• Above all, remember that, unless we choose not
to be, lesbians and gays are invisible. You may,
without knowing it. deeply hurt people around you
unless you question your feelings and assumptions
about homosexuality and accept it as a valid and
healthy alternative lifestyle.
1 o this day, my memory of Roberto is filled with
awe and pain. But perhaps being gay does not have
to be painful. The resources are many. You can, by
liberating yourself, help lesbian and gay people
liberate.
