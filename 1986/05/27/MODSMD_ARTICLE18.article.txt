## An athletic Bug swims through rough waters 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
This is my second-to-last column
(violins swell in the background), and
its by-line ought to be shared by
Bruce Wiggins and Greg Asbury. Be
tween the two of them, Wiggins
(assistant director of University
Operations and Maintenance) and
Asbury (director of Athletic Facilities
and Operations) helped me answer
all five questions in. this week's
column. I'm very grateful, both to
them and to everybody else who
helped out.

Dear Bug Me,
Why is Mem Hoop plugged up by
little colored golf tees, and what would
happen if / pulled one out, as a
souvenir, sort of, HUH?
-Jack Nick la us
Wiggins helped me get started on
this question, referring me to Dick
Milam, University Facilities engineer
coordinator and the man in charge of
repairing Shumway Fountain (the
real name of Mem Hoop).
According to Milam, the problem
dates to the original construction of
the fountain. Initially, the structure
was supposed to be made of stainless
steel. The fountain is essentially a 60
foot-long tube, 14 inches in diameter
with a one-half inch wall, Milam said.
That's a lot of stainless steel, and
there just wasn't enough money to
finance that, so in the end, the foun
tain was made of regular steel.
That created problems later. With
all that water running through it, the
inside of the fountain was highly sus

ceptible to rust. Large pieces of rust
would flake off and clog the foun
tain's holes. Eventually the problem
demanded some serious attention.
Milam's men decided to shut off
the fountain and coat the inside with
a layer of rust-proof epoxy paint. To
keep the paint from running out
through the holes during the spraying
process, they put a golf tee in each of
the fountain's 700 holes.
If a person were to pull one of the
golf tees out right now, it would prob
ably break off at the top because the
bottom of the tee, inside the fountain,
is buried in paint. Or at least that's
what Milam predicts will happen
when his crew pulls out the tees
today.
Because the tees will probably
break off, Milam said he plans to drill
out all the holes before turning the
fountain back on later today or to
morrow.

Dear Bug Me,
Why does the backyard behind En
cina Gym have a wall (with a door in
it!) along one side? It makes ab
solutely no sense. . . .
- Wally the Wallwalker
I always kind of liked this wall — it
makes the field look like a prison
yard or something really cool like
that.
Okay, maybe you had to be there.
Asbury answered this one for me.
It seems that the field behind Encina
Gym is the former site of three swim
ming pools, and the wall dates from
that swimming complex, built in
1927. After DeGuerre was built
around 1974, the pools at Encina
were demolished and filled, according

to Asbuiy.
All that remained was a field full of
weeds, and the wall was left as a
"visual barrier," apparently so
passers-by wouldn't have to look at
that field.
Asbury went on to say that part of
the Athletic Department's plans for
the University Centennial is to re
landscape that yard and make it into
an athletic playfield area, including
sand volleyball courts.

Dear Bug Me,
Can you tell me who is in charge of
the physical facilities at Roble Gym,
and when they last walked inside and
looked at the women's locker room?
Could the showers pass an inspection
by the county health department? Are
any improvements planned?
- Dottie Comstock
According to Asbury, Jean Hel
liwell, building manager of Roble
Gym, is in charge of the gym's day
to-day operations.
But the Athletic Department is ul
timately responsible for all facilities,
and Asbury said that the department
is aware of the conditions at Roble
and is taking a serious look at the
building in preparation for Centen
nial campaign renovations.
"Something serious has to be
done," he commented.
The department would like to keep
the building, but must wait to see
what the status of the building is after
Near West campus plans are
finalized, Asbury said.

Part of the department's Centen
nial plans are to upgrade and
renovate Roble Gym, and possibly to
add an aquatic complex to the facility,
he said.

Dear Bug Me,
Last summer, for the first time in 11
years, De Guerre Pool, fondly known
as the "barracuda pit" by jostled pa
trons of the 12 to 2 p.m. swim, was
emptied for repairs. All the body salts
and other accumulations were flushed
down the drain, and the pool has been
kept reasonably clean ever since.
But the men's changing room is an
other matter. The dirt, mildew, scuz,
hair and crud do furnish a certain
patina to the place, but if alerted the
Health Department should have
ample grounds for shutting the facility
down. Why is the place never cleaned,
or if cleaned so shoddily that one can't
tell the difference? I have twice ac
quired a fungus-growth under my
toenails (not just the customary ath
lete's foot disease picked up there on a
regular basis) that took months of ex
pensive medication to control. The
place is filthy from roof to floor. It is
quite usual at Stanford to cut corners
on maintenance, but this is ridiculous.
While looking into this, you may
also want to inquire why the space has
been so badly allocated in the chang
ing room. The single bench, often
loaded with shoes, green bags, jackets
and assorted clothes, is totally inade
quate to handle all the people that use
the room, which is big enough to ac
commodate whole rows of benches.
Couldn't a little remodeling be done?
Thanks.
- Disgusted DeGuerrist

Gee, there seems to be a lot of hos
tility being directed toward athletic
facilities this week.
I feel compelled to come to the
defense of DeGuerre: granted, the
layout of the men's dressing room is
ridiculous, but the place just isn't that
dirty.
In fact, I've never picked up so
much as the slightest hint of any
fungus or other minor disease in the
times I've been there. It stands to rea
son that any time you get a place with
that much human traffic and
moisture, there's going to be some
mildew and the like.
Asbury said that the locker room is
cleaned six times a week, and each
time the tile and floors are mopped
with disinfectant. He also said that
the tiles need to be etched at least
once a year, but that was more for
cosmetic reasons than health reasons.
Asbury was very forthright about
all this, and frankly, I don't think the
University would knowingly neglect a
facility that gets as much use as
DeGuerre.
Indeed, there are several plans for
renovation, according to Asbury.
First, the walls are going to be
repainted with a paint that includes a
mildew-retardant.
In addition, the layout will be
changed somewhat this summer. As
bury said that the bar that runs along
the wall behind the bench will be
removed, thus liberating the bench
from the dreaded green bag ac
cumulation, and more benches will
probably be added in the middle of
the, room.
Also, Asbury said that something
would probably be done about the
whole check system. Two possibilities
are the use of rolling carts to hang the
bags on and a set of lockers for
storage. These lockers, which are
very tentative due to economic con
siderations, would be just like the
ones at airports, except that you'd get
your money back when you unlock
the locker after using it.
Individuals with strong feelings
about the facilities at DeGuerre
ought to talk to Asbury about the
issue. And anybody with a few
thousand dollars to spare for some
lockers (the cost for 100 lockers is ap

proximately $7,000, Asbury said)
would be really appreciated, too, I'm
sure.

Dear Bug Me,
How many signs are there in the
Band Shak? I've heard they have
some humorous ones. Also, how
many street signs, etc. are stolen from
the Stanford campus each year?
-Steve Smeg
Several members of the Band
counted the signs for me, and ended
up with a total of 322. Some of the
funnier ones probably wouldn't be
appropriate to mention in a family
column like this one.
But a few gems that are men
tionable include "Gerald Ford
Birthplace," "Harvard University
Food Service Administrative Office,"
and a huge banner from some UC-
Berkeley social event that reads, "It's
Okay Not To Drink."
Bruce Wiggins found the informa
tion on University sign theft.
Working from work orders to replace
missing signs, Wiggias found that be
tween October 1984 and March
1986, 53 signs were taken from the
campus. Street name signs were the
most popular, comprising 19 of the
53 signs stolen. Next in popularity,
according to Wiggins, were stop signs
(17) and "No Parking" signs (11).
He said that it cost the University
$3,079.37 to replace all the signs —
$900 in signs and the rest in labor.
Part of that comes out of general
funds (i.e., tuition), Wiggins said, so
students end up paying for a portion
of the sign larceny.

that swimming complex, built in
1927. After DeGuerre was built
around 1974, the pools at Encina
were demolished and filled, according

to Asbuiy.
All that remained was a field full of
weeds, and the wall was left as a
"visual barrier," apparently so
passers-by wouldn't have to look at
that field.
Asbury went on to say that part of
the Athletic Department's plans for
the University Centennial is to re
landscape that yard and make it into
an athletic playfield area, including
sand volleyball courts.

Dear Bug Me,
Can you tell me who is in charge of
the physical facilities at Roble Gym,
and when they last walked inside and
looked at the women's locker room?
Could the showers pass an inspection
by the county health department? Are
any improvements planned?
- Dottie Comstock
According to Asbury, Jean Hel
liwell, building manager of Roble
Gym, is in charge of the gym's day
to-day operations.
But the Athletic Department is ul
timately responsible for all facilities,
and Asbury said that the department
is aware of the conditions at Roble
and is taking a serious look at the
building in preparation for Centen
nial campaign renovations.
"Something serious has to be
done," he commented.
The department would like to keep
the building, but must wait to see
what the status of the building is after
Near West campus plans are
finalized, Asbury said.

Part of the department's Centen
nial plans are to upgrade and
renovate Roble Gym, and possibly to
add an aquatic complex to the facility,
he said.

Dear Bug Me,
Last summer, for the first time in 11
years, De Guerre Pool, fondly known
as the "barracuda pit" by jostled pa
trons of the 12 to 2 p.m. swim, was
emptied for repairs. All the body salts
and other accumulations were flushed
down the drain, and the pool has been
kept reasonably clean ever since.
But the men's changing room is an
other matter. The dirt, mildew, scuz,
hair and crud do furnish a certain
patina to the place, but if alerted the
Health Department should have
ample grounds for shutting the facility
down. Why is the place never cleaned,
or if cleaned so shoddily that one can't
tell the difference? I have twice ac
quired a fungus-growth under my
toenails (not just the customary ath
lete's foot disease picked up there on a
regular basis) that took months of ex
pensive medication to control. The
place is filthy from roof to floor. It is
quite usual at Stanford to cut corners
on maintenance, but this is ridiculous.
While looking into this, you may
also want to inquire why the space has
been so badly allocated in the chang
ing room. The single bench, often
loaded with shoes, green bags, jackets
and assorted clothes, is totally inade
quate to handle all the people that use
the room, which is big enough to ac
commodate whole rows of benches.
Couldn't a little remodeling be done?
Thanks.
- Disgusted DeGuerrist

Gee, there seems to be a lot of hos
tility being directed toward athletic
facilities this week.
I feel compelled to come to the
defense of DeGuerre: granted, the
layout of the men's dressing room is
ridiculous, but the place just isn't that
dirty.
In fact, I've never picked up so
much as the slightest hint of any
fungus or other minor disease in the
times I've been there. It stands to rea
son that any time you get a place with
that much human traffic and
moisture, there's going to be some
mildew and the like.
Asbury said that the locker room is
cleaned six times a week, and each
time the tile and floors are mopped
with disinfectant. He also said that
the tiles need to be etched at least
once a year, but that was more for
cosmetic reasons than health reasons.
Asbury was very forthright about
all this, and frankly, I don't think the
University would knowingly neglect a
facility that gets as much use as
DeGuerre.
Indeed, there are several plans for
renovation, according to Asbury.
First, the walls are going to be
repainted with a paint that includes a
mildew-retardant.
In addition, the layout will be
changed somewhat this summer. As
bury said that the bar that runs along
the wall behind the bench will be
removed, thus liberating the bench
from the dreaded green bag ac
cumulation, and more benches will
probably be added in the middle of
the, room.
Also, Asbury said that something
would probably be done about the
whole check system. Two possibilities
are the use of rolling carts to hang the
bags on and a set of lockers for
storage. These lockers, which are
very tentative due to economic con
siderations, would be just like the
ones at airports, except that you'd get
your money back when you unlock
the locker after using it.
Individuals with strong feelings
about the facilities at DeGuerre
ought to talk to Asbury about the
issue. And anybody with a few
thousand dollars to spare for some
lockers (the cost for 100 lockers is ap

proximately $7,000, Asbury said)
would be really appreciated, too, I'm
sure.

Dear Bug Me,
How many signs are there in the
Band Shak? I've heard they have
some humorous ones. Also, how
many street signs, etc. are stolen from
the Stanford campus each year?
-Steve Smeg
Several members of the Band
counted the signs for me, and ended
up with a total of 322. Some of the
funnier ones probably wouldn't be
appropriate to mention in a family
column like this one.
But a few gems that are men
tionable include "Gerald Ford
Birthplace," "Harvard University
Food Service Administrative Office,"
and a huge banner from some UC-
Berkeley social event that reads, "It's
Okay Not To Drink."
Bruce Wiggins found the informa
tion on University sign theft.
Working from work orders to replace
missing signs, Wiggias found that be
tween October 1984 and March
1986, 53 signs were taken from the
campus. Street name signs were the
most popular, comprising 19 of the
53 signs stolen. Next in popularity,
according to Wiggins, were stop signs
(17) and "No Parking" signs (11).
He said that it cost the University
$3,079.37 to replace all the signs —
$900 in signs and the rest in labor.
Part of that comes out of general
funds (i.e., tuition), Wiggins said, so
students end up paying for a portion
of the sign larceny.





This is my second-to-last column
(violins swell in the background), and
its by-line ought to be shared by
Bruce Wiggins and Greg Asbury. Be
tween the two of them, Wiggins
(assistant director of University
Operations and Maintenance) and
Asbury (director of Athletic Facilities
and Operations) helped me answer
all five questions in. this week's
column. I'm very grateful, both to
them and to everybody else who
helped out.

Dear Bug Me,
Why is Mem Hoop plugged up by
little colored golf tees, and what would
happen if / pulled one out, as a
souvenir, sort of, HUH?
-Jack Nick la us
Wiggins helped me get started on
this question, referring me to Dick
Milam, University Facilities engineer
coordinator and the man in charge of
repairing Shumway Fountain (the
real name of Mem Hoop).
According to Milam, the problem
dates to the original construction of
the fountain. Initially, the structure
was supposed to be made of stainless
steel. The fountain is essentially a 60
foot-long tube, 14 inches in diameter
with a one-half inch wall, Milam said.
That's a lot of stainless steel, and
there just wasn't enough money to
finance that, so in the end, the foun
tain was made of regular steel.
That created problems later. With
all that water running through it, the
inside of the fountain was highly sus

ceptible to rust. Large pieces of rust
would flake off and clog the foun
tain's holes. Eventually the problem
demanded some serious attention.
Milam's men decided to shut off
the fountain and coat the inside with
a layer of rust-proof epoxy paint. To
keep the paint from running out
through the holes during the spraying
process, they put a golf tee in each of
the fountain's 700 holes.
If a person were to pull one of the
golf tees out right now, it would prob
ably break off at the top because the
bottom of the tee, inside the fountain,
is buried in paint. Or at least that's
what Milam predicts will happen
when his crew pulls out the tees
today.
Because the tees will probably
break off, Milam said he plans to drill
out all the holes before turning the
fountain back on later today or to
morrow.

Dear Bug Me,
Why does the backyard behind En
cina Gym have a wall (with a door in
it!) along one side? It makes ab
solutely no sense. . . .
- Wally the Wallwalker
I always kind of liked this wall — it
makes the field look like a prison
yard or something really cool like
that.
Okay, maybe you had to be there.
Asbury answered this one for me.
It seems that the field behind Encina

and assorted clothes, is totally inade
quate to handle all the people that use
the room, which is big enough to ac
commodate whole rows of benches.
Couldn't a little remodeling be done?
Thanks.
- Disgusted DeGuerrist

Gee, there seems to be a lot of hos
tility being directed toward athletic
facilities this week.
I feel compelled to come to the
defense of DeGuerre: granted, the
layout of the men's dressing room is
ridiculous, but the place just isn't that
dirty.
In fact, I've never picked up so
much as the slightest hint of any
fungus or other minor disease in the
times I've been there. It stands to rea
son that any time you get a place with
that much human traffic and
moisture, there's going to be some
mildew and the like.
Asbury said that the locker room is
cleaned six times a week, and each
time the tile and floors are mopped
with disinfectant. He also said that
the tiles need to be etched at least
once a year, but that was more for
cosmetic reasons than health reasons.
Asbury was very forthright about
all this, and frankly, I don't think the
University would knowingly neglect a
facility that gets as much use as
DeGuerre.
Indeed, there are several plans for
renovation, according to Asbury.
First, the walls are going to be
repainted with a paint that includes a
mildew-retardant.
In addition, the layout will be
changed somewhat this summer. As
bury said that the bar that runs along
the wall behind the bench will be
removed, thus liberating the bench
from the dreaded green bag ac
cumulation, and more benches will
probably be added in the middle of
the, room.
Also, Asbury said that something
would probably be done about the
whole check system. Two possibilities
are the use of rolling carts to hang the
bags on and a set of lockers for
storage. These lockers, which are
very tentative due to economic con
siderations, would be just like the
ones at airports, except that you'd get
your money back when you unlock
the locker after using it.
Individuals with strong feelings
about the facilities at DeGuerre
ought to talk to Asbury about the
issue. And anybody with a few
thousand dollars to spare for some
lockers (the cost for 100 lockers is ap

proximately $7,000, Asbury said)
would be really appreciated, too, I'm
sure.

Dear Bug Me,
How many signs are there in the
Band Shak? I've heard they have
some humorous ones. Also, how
many street signs, etc. are stolen from
the Stanford campus each year?
-Steve Smeg
Several members of the Band
counted the signs for me, and ended
up with a total of 322. Some of the
funnier ones probably wouldn't be
appropriate to mention in a family
column like this one.
But a few gems that are men
tionable include "Gerald Ford
Birthplace," "Harvard University
Food Service Administrative Office,"
and a huge banner from some UC-
Berkeley social event that reads, "It's
Okay Not To Drink."
Bruce Wiggins found the informa
tion on University sign theft.
Working from work orders to replace
missing signs, Wiggias found that be
tween October 1984 and March
1986, 53 signs were taken from the
campus. Street name signs were the
most popular, comprising 19 of the
53 signs stolen. Next in popularity,
according to Wiggins, were stop signs
(17) and "No Parking" signs (11).
He said that it cost the University
$3,079.37 to replace all the signs —
$900 in signs and the rest in labor.
Part of that comes out of general
funds (i.e., tuition), Wiggins said, so
students end up paying for a portion
of the sign larceny.





This is my second-to-last column
(violins swell in the background), and
its by-line ought to be shared by
Bruce Wiggins and Greg Asbury. Be
tween the two of them, Wiggins
(assistant director of University
Operations and Maintenance) and
Asbury (director of Athletic Facilities
and Operations) helped me answer
all five questions in. this week's
column. I'm very grateful, both to
them and to everybody else who
helped out.

Dear Bug Me,
Why is Mem Hoop plugged up by
little colored golf tees, and what would
happen if / pulled one out, as a
souvenir, sort of, HUH?
-Jack Nick la us
Wiggins helped me get started on
this question, referring me to Dick
Milam, University Facilities engineer
coordinator and the man in charge of
repairing Shumway Fountain (the
real name of Mem Hoop).
According to Milam, the problem
dates to the original construction of
the fountain. Initially, the structure
was supposed to be made of stainless
steel. The fountain is essentially a 60
foot-long tube, 14 inches in diameter
with a one-half inch wall, Milam said.
That's a lot of stainless steel, and
there just wasn't enough money to
finance that, so in the end, the foun
tain was made of regular steel.
That created problems later. With
all that water running through it, the
inside of the fountain was highly sus

ceptible to rust. Large pieces of rust
would flake off and clog the foun
tain's holes. Eventually the problem
demanded some serious attention.
Milam's men decided to shut off
the fountain and coat the inside with
a layer of rust-proof epoxy paint. To
keep the paint from running out
through the holes during the spraying
process, they put a golf tee in each of
the fountain's 700 holes.
If a person were to pull one of the
golf tees out right now, it would prob
ably break off at the top because the
bottom of the tee, inside the fountain,
is buried in paint. Or at least that's
what Milam predicts will happen
when his crew pulls out the tees
today.
Because the tees will probably
break off, Milam said he plans to drill
out all the holes before turning the
fountain back on later today or to
morrow.

Dear Bug Me,
Why does the backyard behind En
cina Gym have a wall (with a door in
it!) along one side? It makes ab
solutely no sense. . . .
- Wally the Wallwalker
I always kind of liked this wall — it
makes the field look like a prison
yard or something really cool like
that.
Okay, maybe you had to be there.
Asbury answered this one for me.
It seems that the field behind Encina
Gym is the former site of three swim
ming pools, and the wall dates from
that swimming complex, built in
1927. After DeGuerre was built
around 1974, the pools at Encina
were demolished and filled, according

to Asbuiy.
All that remained was a field full of
weeds, and the wall was left as a
"visual barrier," apparently so
passers-by wouldn't have to look at
that field.
Asbury went on to say that part of
the Athletic Department's plans for
the University Centennial is to re
landscape that yard and make it into
an athletic playfield area, including
sand volleyball courts.

Dear Bug Me,
Can you tell me who is in charge of
the physical facilities at Roble Gym,
and when they last walked inside and
looked at the women's locker room?
Could the showers pass an inspection
by the county health department? Are
any improvements planned?
- Dottie Comstock
According to Asbury, Jean Hel
liwell, building manager of Roble
Gym, is in charge of the gym's day
to-day operations.
But the Athletic Department is ul
timately responsible for all facilities,
and Asbury said that the department
is aware of the conditions at Roble
and is taking a serious look at the
building in preparation for Centen
nial campaign renovations.
"Something serious has to be
done," he commented.
The department would like to keep
the building, but must wait to see
what the status of the building is after
Near West campus plans are
finalized, Asbury said.

Part of the department's Centen
nial plans are to upgrade and
renovate Roble Gym, and possibly to
add an aquatic complex to the facility,
he said.

Dear Bug Me,
Last summer, for the first time in 11
years, De Guerre Pool, fondly known
as the "barracuda pit" by jostled pa
trons of the 12 to 2 p.m. swim, was
emptied for repairs. All the body salts
and other accumulations were flushed
down the drain, and the pool has been
kept reasonably clean ever since.
But the men's changing room is an
other matter. The dirt, mildew, scuz,
hair and crud do furnish a certain
patina to the place, but if alerted the
Health Department should have
ample grounds for shutting the facility
down. Why is the place never cleaned,
or if cleaned so shoddily that one can't
tell the difference? I have twice ac
quired a fungus-growth under my
toenails (not just the customary ath
lete's foot disease picked up there on a
regular basis) that took months of ex
pensive medication to control. The
place is filthy from roof to floor. It is
quite usual at Stanford to cut corners
on maintenance, but this is ridiculous.
While looking into this, you may
also want to inquire why the space has
been so badly allocated in the chang
ing room. The single bench, often
loaded with shoes, green bags, jackets
and assorted clothes, is totally inade
quate to handle all the people that use
the room, which is big enough to ac
commodate whole rows of benches.
Couldn't a little remodeling be done?
