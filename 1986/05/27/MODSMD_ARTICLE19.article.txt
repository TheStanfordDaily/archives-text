## Herodotus features students' writings 
### FELICIA PAIK Senior staff writer 
Herodotus lives again.
The fifth century B.C. Greek
historian, considered the "father
of history," has been resurrected
by the History Undergraduate
Student Association (HUGSA) —
in name at least.
HUGSA has titled its journal
"Herodotus" after the classical
historian, who was one of the first
to chronicle events of the past.
The journal — a collection of
student writings on historical top
ics — will be available in the His
tory Department today.
According to junior Elizabeth
Cheng, editor of "Herodotus," the
journal will be published twice
yearly, once in the fall and once in
the spring, in the years to come.
"The journal will expand
people's awareness of history
outside the classroom," said
Cheng, a history major.
This is the first publication by
the students of the History De
partment, according to Cheng.
The journal is funded through the
Department of History and the
School of Humanities and
Sciences.

" 'Herodotus' will provide an
open forum for discussion. It's
easy to go to class, turn in your
papers and then forget about
them. This will be a good way for
students to share thoughts and
ideas," Cheng said.
" Aside from discussion sections,
how many opportunities do you
have to see what your peers are
writing about?" asked sophomore
Sarah Tilton, a member of the
publication's editorial board.
"The journal will tell students
about the quality and focus of un
dergraduate work," said Tilton,
also a history major.
The first publication consists of
four student papers and a set of
original historical poems. The
works were chosen through dis
cussions of the editorial board and
comment from history graduate
students.
One does not need to be a his
tory major to be a staff member,
Cheng said. Any student who has
an interest in history may contrib
ute.
The staff is comprised of 10 edi
torial board members and cur
rently is looking for new staffers
for the 1986-87 school year.
