# Fendick gets even in final

### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
AUSTIN, Texas — Back in January, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan sat in his office atop the Varsity Tennis
Courts, a bit dismayed by the fact that his ace singles
player, Patty Fendick, had not been ranked No. I in the
preseason polls. He called her No. 4 ranking "silly."
Fendick's play throughout the early part of the dual
match season suggested that her ranking might have been
too generous, but with the beginning of the spring season,
the Cardinal junior started on a roll that climaxed Friday
with her triumph here in the singles final at the 1986
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships.
Her 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 win over Trinity's Gretchen Rush wits
her 17th straight singles victory. It was not only vindica
tion for Brennan's preseason prediction, but it settled an
old score for Fendick. She had never defeated the Trinity
senior.
Fendick, the No. 6 seed, became the Cardinal's fifth
women's singles champion and second in as many years.
Last season, Stanford's Linda Gates defeated Rush in
straight sets for the title.
"I'm going to party the whole way home," Fendick said
moments after the match. "I wasn't allowed to party after
the team thing."
Hailing from nearby San Antonio and having never
won the singles championship. Rush was the sentimental
favorite prior to the match. Despite a vocal, partisan
crowd, however, she was admittedly overwhelmed by the
streaking Fendick.
"I'm a little disappointed," Rush said. "But I really
think I was beaten. I really think she outplayed me. She
put tons of pressure on me. I always felt defensive."
Rush, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, had the crowd
on its feet in the first set, but her 6-2 victory was more a
case of Fendick losing points than her brilliance.
"I've lost to Gretchen so many times, the pressure was
all on her," Fendick said. "1 knew she was going to be a
little bit nervous. I was surprised how nervous I was.
"Gretchen's a great player, and it's tough to get up to
play her," she added. "I started out a little bit tired. I had
trouble getting my feet going. I missed a ball completely."
"In the first set, she missed a lot of
shots," Rush said.
Fendick was up a break in the first
set, but serving at 2-1 her forehand
started to fall apart. She hit three un
forced errors as Rush broke back to
2-2 and then lost two game points in
the next game on more unforced er
rors.
Rush broke serve to go ahead 4-2
when Fendick completely fanned on a
forehand. After holding serve, Rush
took the set as Fendick lost her serve
for the third straight time.
With the crowd hollering on her
behalf, Rush served the first game of
the second set, but a determined Fen
dick made some noise of her own
with a scalding backhand passing shot
to break Rush's serve.
Fendick held her serve to go up 2-
0, but she appeared to reinjure the
abdominal muscle she had strained in
Thursday's semifinal against Texas'
Beverly Bowes.
At the changeover, the Stanford
trainer came onto the court and ap
plied an ice massage to Fendick's

side. She was forced to take a little off
of her first serve, but the muscle
strain actually helped Fendick's game
at the same time. "It made me con
centrate on other things," she said
later.
Her serve was not as much of a fac
tor in the second set, but Fendick's
forehand, which had been devastating
all week, returned to form. "Patty
really raised the level of her game,"
Rush said.
"I think I was just a little more ag
gressive than she was," Fendick said.
"I felt like I had to hit the ball a little
bit harder."
Trailing 3-0, Rush broke Fendick's
serve to come within 3-1, but her
serve then failed her and she double
faulted to give Fendick a 4-1 advan
tage.
"I was kind of disappointed in my
serve," Rush said. "I know I have to
serve well to stay in the match with
her."
Fendick's forehand remained
strong as she won the next two games
to send the match to a third set. She
then captured the first two games of
the decisive set and was dominating
the defensive Rush.
Fendick looked to be in complete

control, but her serve continued to be
hindered by the muscle aggravation.
She hunched over after several first
serves, and Rush rattled off four
straight points to break back to 2-1.
The Stanford All-American then
netted a backhand at 3-3 in the fourth
game, and Rush was even at 2-2.
As quickly as Rush had gotten back
into the set, however, Fendick moved
back out to a 5-2 lead. Her serve may
have been affected by the injury, but
her lethal forehand was untainted.
At 3-3 in the eighth game, Fendick
had a championship point, but she hit
a forehand into the net, and Rush was
still alive at 5-3.
In last year's semifinals, Fendick
had blown a 5-2 third-set lead to
Rush. But on Friday, no thoughts of a
repeat occurrence entered her mind.
"1 was not going to let myself think
about that at all," she said.
Rush didn't let the crowd conjure
up thoughts of last year either. She hit
two backhands out to put Fendick
two points away from the title. Fen
dick then smashed a forehand and
had a quadruple championship point.
Her next serve was returned way out,
and a slightly stunned Fendick had
knocked off her biggest nemesis.

play her," she added. "I started out a little bit tired. I had
trouble getting my feet going. I missed a ball completely."
"In the first set, she missed a lot of
shots," Rush said.
Fendick was up a break in the first
set, but serving at 2-1 her forehand
started to fall apart. She hit three un
forced errors as Rush broke back to
2-2 and then lost two game points in
the next game on more unforced er
rors.
Rush broke serve to go ahead 4-2
when Fendick completely fanned on a
forehand. After holding serve, Rush
took the set as Fendick lost her serve
for the third straight time.
With the crowd hollering on her
behalf, Rush served the first game of
the second set, but a determined Fen
dick made some noise of her own
with a scalding backhand passing shot
to break Rush's serve.
Fendick held her serve to go up 2-
0, but she appeared to reinjure the
abdominal muscle she had strained in
Thursday's semifinal against Texas'
Beverly Bowes.
At the changeover, the Stanford
trainer came onto the court and ap
plied an ice massage to Fendick's

side. She was forced to take a little off
of her first serve, but the muscle
strain actually helped Fendick's game
at the same time. "It made me con
centrate on other things," she said
later.
Her serve was not as much of a fac
tor in the second set, but Fendick's
forehand, which had been devastating
all week, returned to form. "Patty
really raised the level of her game,"
Rush said.
"I think I was just a little more ag
gressive than she was," Fendick said.
"I felt like I had to hit the ball a little
bit harder."
Trailing 3-0, Rush broke Fendick's
serve to come within 3-1, but her
serve then failed her and she double
faulted to give Fendick a 4-1 advan
tage.
"I was kind of disappointed in my
serve," Rush said. "I know I have to
serve well to stay in the match with
her."
Fendick's forehand remained
strong as she won the next two games
to send the match to a third set. She
then captured the first two games of
the decisive set and was dominating
the defensive Rush.
Fendick looked to be in complete

control, but her serve continued to be
hindered by the muscle aggravation.
She hunched over after several first
serves, and Rush rattled off four
straight points to break back to 2-1.
The Stanford All-American then
netted a backhand at 3-3 in the fourth
game, and Rush was even at 2-2.
As quickly as Rush had gotten back
into the set, however, Fendick moved
back out to a 5-2 lead. Her serve may
have been affected by the injury, but
her lethal forehand was untainted.
At 3-3 in the eighth game, Fendick
had a championship point, but she hit
a forehand into the net, and Rush was
still alive at 5-3.
In last year's semifinals, Fendick
had blown a 5-2 third-set lead to
Rush. But on Friday, no thoughts of a
repeat occurrence entered her mind.
"1 was not going to let myself think
about that at all," she said.
Rush didn't let the crowd conjure
up thoughts of last year either. She hit
two backhands out to put Fendick
two points away from the title. Fen
dick then smashed a forehand and
had a quadruple championship point.
Her next serve was returned way out,
and a slightly stunned Fendick had
knocked off her biggest nemesis.
AUSTIN, Texas — Back in January, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan sat in his office atop the Varsity Tennis
Courts, a bit dismayed by the fact that his ace singles
player, Patty Fendick, had not been ranked No. I in the
preseason polls. He called her No. 4 ranking "silly."
Fendick's play throughout the early part of the dual
match season suggested that her ranking might have been
too generous, but with the beginning of the spring season,
the Cardinal junior started on a roll that climaxed Friday
with her triumph here in the singles final at the 1986
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships.
Her 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 win over Trinity's Gretchen Rush wits
her 17th straight singles victory. It was not only vindica
tion for Brennan's preseason prediction, but it settled an
old score for Fendick. She had never defeated the Trinity
senior.
Fendick, the No. 6 seed, became the Cardinal's fifth
women's singles champion and second in as many years.
Last season, Stanford's Linda Gates defeated Rush in
straight sets for the title.
"I'm going to party the whole way home," Fendick said
moments after the match. "I wasn't allowed to party after
the team thing."
Hailing from nearby San Antonio and having never
won the singles championship. Rush was the sentimental
favorite prior to the match. Despite a vocal, partisan
crowd, however, she was admittedly overwhelmed by the
streaking Fendick.
"I'm a little disappointed," Rush said. "But I really
think I was beaten. I really think she outplayed me. She
put tons of pressure on me. I always felt defensive."
Rush, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, had the crowd
on its feet in the first set, but her 6-2 victory was more a
case of Fendick losing points than her brilliance.
"I've lost to Gretchen so many times, the pressure was
all on her," Fendick said. "1 knew she was going to be a
little bit nervous. I was surprised how nervous I was.
"Gretchen's a great player, and it's tough to get up to
play her," she added. "I started out a little bit tired. I had
