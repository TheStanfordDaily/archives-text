# Fendick gets even in final

AUSTIN, Texas â€” Back in January, Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan sat in his office atop the Varsity Tennis
Courts, a bit dismayed by the fact that his ace singles
player, Patty Fendick, had not been ranked No. I in the
preseason polls. He called her No. 4 ranking "silly."
Fendick's play throughout the early part of the dual
match season suggested that her ranking might have been
too generous, but with the beginning of the spring season,
the Cardinal junior started on a roll that climaxed Friday
with her triumph here in the singles final at the 1986
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships.
Her 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 win over Trinity's Gretchen Rush wits
her 17th straight singles victory. It was not only vindica
tion for Brennan's preseason prediction, but it settled an
old score for Fendick. She had never defeated the Trinity
senior.
Fendick, the No. 6 seed, became the Cardinal's fifth
women's singles champion and second in as many years.
Last season, Stanford's Linda Gates defeated Rush in
straight sets for the title.
"I'm going to party the whole way home," Fendick said
moments after the match. "I wasn't allowed to party after
the team thing."
Hailing from nearby San Antonio and having never
won the singles championship. Rush was the sentimental
favorite prior to the match. Despite a vocal, partisan
crowd, however, she was admittedly overwhelmed by the
streaking Fendick.
"I'm a little disappointed," Rush said. "But I really
think I was beaten. I really think she outplayed me. She
put tons of pressure on me. I always felt defensive."
Rush, the No. 2 seed in the tournament, had the crowd
on its feet in the first set, but her 6-2 victory was more a
case of Fendick losing points than her brilliance.
"I've lost to Gretchen so many times, the pressure was
all on her," Fendick said. "1 knew she was going to be a
little bit nervous. I was surprised how nervous I was.
"Gretchen's a great player, and it's tough to get up to
play her," she added. "I started out a little bit tired. I had
trouble getting my feet going. I missed a ball completely."
