## I owe, I owe, it's off to work I go.... Summertime jobs bring summertime salaries 
### PHIL BLACK Staff writer 
Summer .. . it's finally here. Well, almost.
Within three weeks many Stanford students
will have switched from maneuvering bikes
through the Quad at 9 a.m. to get to their
class, to joining the rat race on the freeways to
get to work.
Instead of filling out PTRs, receiving blue
books and providing their pledge,
students will be filling out their W-4s, reciev
ing their W-2s and providing their social se
curity number. While summer jobs can be in
teresting, the red tape involved can be confus
ing and frustrating.
Phyllis Camm of H & R Block in Mountain
View gave some pertinent advice to expedite
the tax process that all students working in the
summer will encounter.
"When a person first starts to work, he will
be required to fill out a W-4 form. The W-4
requires you to declare your exemptions and
most students will only have one — them
selves," Camm said.
"A student can declare himself exempt
from withholdings if his total estimated an
nual income is under $3,430. However, if you
expect your total income — interest and divi
dend income plus your wages — to exceed
$3,430 then you cannot declare yourself ex
empt from withholdings," Camm added. In
this case, you can expect the government to
take a little bit of your paycheck each month.
"Once you have quit work, your employer
is required to send you a W-2 form. The W-2
is statement of all wages and withholdings,"
Camm said. "It is very important that you
keep your check stubs throughout the year so
that you can verify the information on the W
-2.
"You will need to file an income tax return
if you have any withholdings or if you earned
over $3,430 during the year. You can file the
1040EZ form unless you have over $400 in
interest and dividend income in which case
you will need to file a 1040 A form," Camm
explained.
Once you have weeded through the tax
scene, you are now ready to start earning
those megabucks that summer jobs are
notoriously known to pay. While that may be
stretching the truth a little bit, summer jobs
usually give students a fair amount of extra
cash with which to play. This extra money,
however, can easily disappear. As Jan
Youden, a certified financial planner (CFP)
based in Palo Alto, put it, "Conserve what
you have because there are so many ways to
spend it."

Youden is part of a growing group of
professionals who, according to her, "Help
people mold their financial goals to their capi
tal wants and needs." While some people
might think that a financial planner would be
required only if large sums of money were in
volved, a CFP can provide helpful advice to
students who want to know where to put their
summer earnings.
Another source of advice comes from Craig
Foreman, a financial consultant for Merrill
Lynch of Palo Alto. Foreman has numerous
financial instruments that he can use and
usually draws upon some of the best advice in

the country to help plan your financial needs.
So, where do you put those summer dol
lars? Before you decide that question,
Youden suggested, "Make goals for your
money so that your money will work for you."
Foreman concurred, saying, "Define your
goals. What do you want from your money?
Spending money can be a goal in itself, but at
least know that that is your goal."
If you don't want to spend all of your earn
ings, then you need to know all of the options
available to you. Youden said, "Liquidity of
money is probably the most important factor
for students because the funds will be needed

in the fall. Consequently, you have less op
tions. The most viable for students would be a
money market fund, a bank, or a savings and
loans institution.
"A money market fund would probably
give the highest yield and flexibility. Pres
ently, a Money Market Fund would yield
about 6.5 to 6.75 percent and checks could be
written if the amount is in excess of $500."
Youden also gave several ideas on how to
handle funds this summer and into the
fall quarter. "Be sure to place your extra dol
lars into an account that is not as easily acces
sible as your checking account. When it is not

in currency or in a demand deposit checking
account, people tend to not count it as spen
dable money.
"If your funds allow, place enough money
in your bank checking account once a month
to cover your expenses, but keep the rest in
your Money Market Account or in your
savings account,' Youden said. "You learn to
budget and you keep earning interest.
"If you use a credit card and you overspend
on it, then stop using the card and only pay
cash. Paying cash makes you much more
aware of what and how much you are spend
ing. Regardless of how you spend your;
money, be sure to evaluate what you are
doing with your money," Youden counseled.
With the recent strength of the stock mar
ket, people might want to invest their summer
money Wall Street style. Youden commented,
however, "Stocks require monitoring and
excess capital needs above one's basic living
expenses."
Along with the cost of investing in stocks,
Foreman said, "One's risk tolerance must be
higher than someone who definitely wants to
see his principal amount remain intact three
or six months down the line.
"If one is game for the market, though, an
individual can purchase small amounts of
stock, buy a mutual fund or participate in the'
Merrill Lynch Sharebuilder Program, where
one can buy stocks, mutual funds, precious
metals and numerous other financial instru-'
ments in small or large quantities," Foreman
said.
If you don't want to place your money in '
the stock market, Foreman suggested placing
some of your money in a three or six month
certificate of deposit (CD). "Merrill Lynch is ;
able to shop around the state and country for
you so that you get the highest rate possible.
Right now you can invest as little as $500 in a
three month CD and probably get around 7
percent," Foreman said.
"The process for setting up an account at
Merrill Lynch is very easy. One fills out a new
account form and then makes the transaction.
The transactions could be the purchase of a
money market fund or of shares of stock."
Foreman ended by saying, "The investment
of your own money, whether it be in CDs,
stocks, bonds, mutual funds or a number of'
things, can be educationally as well as finan
cially rewarding."
So if you are joining the rat race this sum-'
mer and you want to keep up with the Joneses,
plan wisely what you will do with the money
you earn. It may not seem like a lot, but you
can do your best to make a little go a long
way.
