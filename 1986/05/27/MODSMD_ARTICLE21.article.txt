## 'Makioka Sisters' enliven fragile story-world 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Kon Ichikawa's "The Makioka
Sisters" (adapted from the novel by
Junichiro Tanizaki) engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost miraculous.
The movie chronicles one year in the
lives of four Japanese sisters, the
daughters of a wealthy, deceased ship
owner, who've established their name
and fortune in Osaka; they are the
heirs to the Makioka fortune, and
they live very comfortable, sheltered
lives.
The eldest, Tsuruko, has married a
wealthy businessman and occupies
herself with dispensing the dwindling
family finances to her sisters. The
second sister, Sachiko, concerns her
self with finding a husband for her
younger sibling Yukiko. Yukiko
meets several suitors a year, and
rejects them one by one; she lives un
der Sachiko's care, together with the
youngest sister, Taeko, who cannot
marry until Yukiko does.
The concerns of these women are
almost exclusively familial, with the
exception of Taeko, who runs a small
doll shop and maintains a degree of
self-sufficiency. And as the movie fol
lows their interactions over the
course of a year, nothing they do
seems obvious or structured in terms
of storyline, yet it all makes intuitive
sense. The film is like a walk down a
beautiful Japanese garden path; you
don't anticipate what's coming, you
just take in the wealth of patterns and
colors, and you might be surprised by
an unexpected perspective or a jux
taposition of design.
"The Makioka Sisters" may be the
epitome of what is called "seamless"
moviemaking; we follow the charac
ters and watch relationships develop
and incidents come together without
recognizing any big climactic mo
ments, any obvious payoffs. Plot
threads are dropped only to be picked
up later; characters appear with little
or no introduction, and we get to
know them as the story moves on.
The plot has little visible structure,
yet this isn't disconcerting, because
the entire movie has an emotional
flow that ties it all together. Ich
ikawa's instinct for moving from
scene to scene and character to char
acter is nearly infallible; nothing
seems emotionally truncated, and we
never feel cheated. I've seen the film
twice, and the second time there were
a few jumps and breaks in the print.
These were especially unsettling, be
cause the editing rhythms in "The
Makioka Sisters" are so delicate that
any break in the flow practically
seems a violation of nature (Chizuko
Nagata is the film editor).
In the way it presents and treats its
characters, this movie recalls last
summer's "The Home and the
World." Both Satyajit Ray and Ic
hikawa seem on absolutely intimate
terms with their characters, and the
closeness is apparent in the way they
follow them, observe their move
ments and show us what the charac
ters are thinking without violating
their privacy.
Thinking back on Ichikawa's film,

one of my most vivid recollections is
of the glances exchanged by the
sisters. You sense levels of communi
cation between these women that
would seem supernatural were the at
mosphere any less intimate; their un
derstanding is rooted in their growing
up together in a very particular,
protected environment.
In the opening scenes the sisters sit
together and discuss the issues that
encompass the entire movie: the
Makioka dowry and Tsuruko's con
trol over it, Yukiko's need to find a
husband, Taeko's independence. And
for the next two hours, these themes
are turned over, examined from the
point of view of each of the sisters
and their husbands, and the varia
tions in perspective are like beautiful,
slightly different harmonies that
come together into one gorgeous
melody.
The sisters' communication is in
the way they hold their heads and
smile with their exquisitely painted
lips; these are women born and bred
on delicacies of appearance, and
they're startled when a servant
catches them laughing or someone
discovers them smoking a cigarette.
The Makiokas — particularly the
three eldest — know that they are ob
jects of contemplation, and they turn
their translucent faces and porcelain
shoulders to catch the light, or worry
over the sashes on their kimonos. But
they never seem entirely frivolous,
because their way of life has been
preserved for centuries, and we get a
sense of how fragile it is when we
hear (from the husbands) about the
industrialization of Japan, the current
war with Manchuria and the impend
ing world war (the year is 1938).
What is important to them — the
name of their family, the history of
the family business, the nuances of
personal appearance — are on the
verge of being lost forever. We see
this in Taeko, of course, but also in
Teinosuke and Tatsuo (the two eldest
daughters' husbands), who are more
pragmatic, businesslike and from a
slightly lower class than the
Makiokas.
The film shows us the ridiculous
ness and the impracticality of the
sisters' lifestyle in the modern world,
but it also mourns the loss of the
beauty and refinement they repre
sent, mirrored in the Japanese
landscapes that inhabit the movie.
The shimmering images and interplay
of colors have a never-to-be-seen
again quality that, near the end, is ab
solutely overwhelming.
It would be easy for this delicate,
alien culture to seem distanced from a
modern American audience, but the
performances draw us in, and hold us
in thrall. As the eldest, Keiko Kishi
embodies a frail strength. Tsuruko
became the surrogate parent to the
others when their mother and father
died, and she seems emotionally cut
off from all but Sachiko; her position
of authority, and that of her husband,
have alienated the two youngest, who
prefer to live with Sachiko and
Teinosuke.
Tsuruko seems distanced from us,
too, until the moment when she

agrees to leave Osaka with Tatsuo,
who has been promoted to a position
in Tokyo. She breaks down in Sa
chiko's arms and confesses she is ter
rified of letting go of the family; she
wishes she could be more of a sister to
the younger two. And Sachiko,
played by Yoshiko Sakuma, is also
humanized in this scene. She em
bodies different aspects of all the
sisters, and her character might seem
unfocused were Sakuma any less of
an actress. Sachiko's closeness to
Tsuruko in later scenes helps create
natural distinctions and allegiances
within the Makioka clan that serve to
define her and the others' characters.
We catch glimpses of Teinsuko's
attraction to Yukiko — and looking
at her, we can see why men are falling
over themselves to marry her. She
practically radiates the Makioka
qualities of sensitivity, fragility and
sensuality. You can believe that she
understands her sisters and their hus
bands better than they understand
themselves; and, even more incredi
bly, she empathizes with them. Sayuri

Yoshinaga shines in this near
impossible role, in which she is re
quired to be almost always passive,
yet alert, knowing and firm — an iron
butterfly.
Her Yukiko is usually at the center
of attention, particularly in the scenes
with the potential grooms, which are
the most overtly comic in the film.
And we recognize her pained polite
ness when she realizes that she cannot
be happy with yet another suitor; she
wants to please her sisters, but not at
the expense of an unhappy marriage.
Yuko Kotegawa's Taeko is the
most schematic of the characters;
she's the rebel sister, and her attrac
tion to men of lower social standing
seems underdeveloped, and a little
too pat. We see almost nothing of her
relationship with the bartender
(Kazunaga Tsuji) she eventually
marries, and Tsuji makes no impres
sion in his brief scenes.
Taeko's dollmaking is wonderfully
appropriate, however, and the con
nection between her exquisitely
modeled dolls and her sisters is sub

versively, subliminally funny. We
sense Taeko's conflicting loyalty to
her sisters and her desires for inde
pendence, and Kotegawa moves be
tween the worlds of modern woman
and traditional Makioka sister with
graceful ease. She even slips in and
out of her two roles while fitted in her
rigidly beautiful and proper kimono
dress; it's a delicate comedy routine.
Ichikawa balances perfectly
photographed interiors (by Kiyoshi
Hasegawa) with panoramic exteriors
of Japanese landscape in the four
seasons; they give the movie a sense
of progression, and serve as a visual
framing device. The startling pink
and lavender blossoms of the spring
give way to the subdued greens of the
summer and fall and, eventually, to
the more muted greens and greys of
winter. The falling cherry blossoms of
the spring become the melting snow
flakes of winter (the original title of
Tanizaki's novel was "A Light Snow
fair').
Ichikawa does more than open the
movie out in these scenes; he roots

the Makioka sisters in time and place,
by connecting them with the period in
Japanese culture that produced these
meticulous designs in nature. And
then he takes us inside the homes and
lives of the sisters, and shows us how
the values are eroding — or perhaps
just evolving. There's an elegant per
manency in the Makioka sistferfc
outside and dressed for appearances;
they are an incorruptible display of
femininity that looks as if it will last
forever.
And though the dramatic conclu
sion of the film takes place at a train
station, with the huge, blackened
engine bellowing steam (it's a very
harsh, modern image compared to
what we've seen up to this point), I
chikawa ends his film with a slow
motion, elegiac walk in the garden,
the sisters gliding ahead and the hus
bands trailing as shadows behind. We
see them as icons of grace and beauty,
but we know them as human beings.
Somehow, those identities fuse in our
memory and become something truly
beautiful.


Kon Ichikawa's "Makioka Sisters" paints an engaging portrait of the
lives of Japanese women entering the modern world. Not only is the

cinematography exquisite, but the characters leap out and grab you, too
— and that's not easy in this age of sequels, prequels and glitz.

of storyline, yet it all makes intuitive
sense. The film is like a walk down a
beautiful Japanese garden path; you
don't anticipate what's coming, you
just take in the wealth of patterns and
colors, and you might be surprised by
an unexpected perspective or a jux
taposition of design.
"The Makioka Sisters" may be the
epitome of what is called "seamless"
moviemaking; we follow the charac
ters and watch relationships develop
and incidents come together without
recognizing any big climactic mo
ments, any obvious payoffs. Plot
threads are dropped only to be picked
up later; characters appear with little
or no introduction, and we get to
know them as the story moves on.
The plot has little visible structure,
yet this isn't disconcerting, because
the entire movie has an emotional
flow that ties it all together. Ich
ikawa's instinct for moving from
scene to scene and character to char
acter is nearly infallible; nothing
seems emotionally truncated, and we
never feel cheated. I've seen the film
twice, and the second time there were
a few jumps and breaks in the print.
These were especially unsettling, be
cause the editing rhythms in "The
Makioka Sisters" are so delicate that
any break in the flow practically
seems a violation of nature (Chizuko
Nagata is the film editor).
In the way it presents and treats its
characters, this movie recalls last
summer's "The Home and the
World." Both Satyajit Ray and Ic
hikawa seem on absolutely intimate
terms with their characters, and the
closeness is apparent in the way they
follow them, observe their move
ments and show us what the charac
ters are thinking without violating
their privacy.
Thinking back on Ichikawa's film,

one of my most vivid recollections is
of the glances exchanged by the
sisters. You sense levels of communi
cation between these women that
would seem supernatural were the at
mosphere any less intimate; their un
derstanding is rooted in their growing
up together in a very particular,
protected environment.
In the opening scenes the sisters sit
together and discuss the issues that
encompass the entire movie: the
Makioka dowry and Tsuruko's con
trol over it, Yukiko's need to find a
husband, Taeko's independence. And
for the next two hours, these themes
are turned over, examined from the
point of view of each of the sisters
and their husbands, and the varia
tions in perspective are like beautiful,
slightly different harmonies that
come together into one gorgeous
melody.
The sisters' communication is in
the way they hold their heads and
smile with their exquisitely painted
lips; these are women born and bred
on delicacies of appearance, and
they're startled when a servant
catches them laughing or someone
discovers them smoking a cigarette.
The Makiokas — particularly the
three eldest — know that they are ob
jects of contemplation, and they turn
their translucent faces and porcelain
shoulders to catch the light, or worry
over the sashes on their kimonos. But
they never seem entirely frivolous,
because their way of life has been
preserved for centuries, and we get a
sense of how fragile it is when we
hear (from the husbands) about the
industrialization of Japan, the current
war with Manchuria and the impend
ing world war (the year is 1938).
What is important to them — the
name of their family, the history of
the family business, the nuances of
personal appearance — are on the
verge of being lost forever. We see
this in Taeko, of course, but also in
Teinosuke and Tatsuo (the two eldest
daughters' husbands), who are more
pragmatic, businesslike and from a
slightly lower class than the
Makiokas.
The film shows us the ridiculous
ness and the impracticality of the
sisters' lifestyle in the modern world,
but it also mourns the loss of the
beauty and refinement they repre
sent, mirrored in the Japanese
landscapes that inhabit the movie.
The shimmering images and interplay
of colors have a never-to-be-seen
again quality that, near the end, is ab
solutely overwhelming.
It would be easy for this delicate,
alien culture to seem distanced from a
modern American audience, but the
performances draw us in, and hold us
in thrall. As the eldest, Keiko Kishi
embodies a frail strength. Tsuruko
became the surrogate parent to the
others when their mother and father
died, and she seems emotionally cut
off from all but Sachiko; her position
of authority, and that of her husband,
have alienated the two youngest, who
prefer to live with Sachiko and
Teinosuke.
Tsuruko seems distanced from us,
too, until the moment when she

agrees to leave Osaka with Tatsuo,
who has been promoted to a position
in Tokyo. She breaks down in Sa
chiko's arms and confesses she is ter
rified of letting go of the family; she
wishes she could be more of a sister to
the younger two. And Sachiko,
played by Yoshiko Sakuma, is also
humanized in this scene. She em
bodies different aspects of all the
sisters, and her character might seem
unfocused were Sakuma any less of
an actress. Sachiko's closeness to
Tsuruko in later scenes helps create
natural distinctions and allegiances
within the Makioka clan that serve to
define her and the others' characters.
We catch glimpses of Teinsuko's
attraction to Yukiko — and looking
at her, we can see why men are falling
over themselves to marry her. She
practically radiates the Makioka
qualities of sensitivity, fragility and
sensuality. You can believe that she
understands her sisters and their hus
bands better than they understand
themselves; and, even more incredi
bly, she empathizes with them. Sayuri

Yoshinaga shines in this near
impossible role, in which she is re
quired to be almost always passive,
yet alert, knowing and firm — an iron
butterfly.
Her Yukiko is usually at the center
of attention, particularly in the scenes
with the potential grooms, which are
the most overtly comic in the film.
And we recognize her pained polite
ness when she realizes that she cannot
be happy with yet another suitor; she
wants to please her sisters, but not at
the expense of an unhappy marriage.
Yuko Kotegawa's Taeko is the
most schematic of the characters;
she's the rebel sister, and her attrac
tion to men of lower social standing
seems underdeveloped, and a little
too pat. We see almost nothing of her
relationship with the bartender
(Kazunaga Tsuji) she eventually
marries, and Tsuji makes no impres
sion in his brief scenes.
Taeko's dollmaking is wonderfully
appropriate, however, and the con
nection between her exquisitely
modeled dolls and her sisters is sub

versively, subliminally funny. We
sense Taeko's conflicting loyalty to
her sisters and her desires for inde
pendence, and Kotegawa moves be
tween the worlds of modern woman
and traditional Makioka sister with
graceful ease. She even slips in and
out of her two roles while fitted in her
rigidly beautiful and proper kimono
dress; it's a delicate comedy routine.
Ichikawa balances perfectly
photographed interiors (by Kiyoshi
Hasegawa) with panoramic exteriors
of Japanese landscape in the four
seasons; they give the movie a sense
of progression, and serve as a visual
framing device. The startling pink
and lavender blossoms of the spring
give way to the subdued greens of the
summer and fall and, eventually, to
the more muted greens and greys of
winter. The falling cherry blossoms of
the spring become the melting snow
flakes of winter (the original title of
Tanizaki's novel was "A Light Snow
fair').
Ichikawa does more than open the
movie out in these scenes; he roots

the Makioka sisters in time and place,
by connecting them with the period in
Japanese culture that produced these
meticulous designs in nature. And
then he takes us inside the homes and
lives of the sisters, and shows us how
the values are eroding — or perhaps
just evolving. There's an elegant per
manency in the Makioka sistferfc
outside and dressed for appearances;
they are an incorruptible display of
femininity that looks as if it will last
forever.
And though the dramatic conclu
sion of the film takes place at a train
station, with the huge, blackened
engine bellowing steam (it's a very
harsh, modern image compared to
what we've seen up to this point), I
chikawa ends his film with a slow
motion, elegiac walk in the garden,
the sisters gliding ahead and the hus
bands trailing as shadows behind. We
see them as icons of grace and beauty,
but we know them as human beings.
Somehow, those identities fuse in our
memory and become something truly
beautiful.


Kon Ichikawa's "Makioka Sisters" paints an engaging portrait of the
lives of Japanese women entering the modern world. Not only is the

cinematography exquisite, but the characters leap out and grab you, too
— and that's not easy in this age of sequels, prequels and glitz.
Kon Ichikawa's "The Makioka
Sisters" (adapted from the novel by
Junichiro Tanizaki) engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost miraculous.
The movie chronicles one year in the
lives of four Japanese sisters, the
daughters of a wealthy, deceased ship
owner, who've established their name
and fortune in Osaka; they are the
heirs to the Makioka fortune, and
they live very comfortable, sheltered
lives.
The eldest, Tsuruko, has married a
wealthy businessman and occupies
herself with dispensing the dwindling
family finances to her sisters. The
second sister, Sachiko, concerns her
self with finding a husband for her
younger sibling Yukiko. Yukiko
meets several suitors a year, and
rejects them one by one; she lives un
der Sachiko's care, together with the
youngest sister, Taeko, who cannot
marry until Yukiko does.
The concerns of these women are
almost exclusively familial, with the
exception of Taeko, who runs a small
doll shop and maintains a degree of
self-sufficiency. And as the movie fol
lows their interactions over the
course of a year, nothing they do
seems obvious or structured in terms
of storyline, yet it all makes intuitive
sense. The film is like a walk down a
beautiful Japanese garden path; you
don't anticipate what's coming, you

Makioka Sisters" are so delicate that
any break in the flow practically
seems a violation of nature (Chizuko
Nagata is the film editor).
In the way it presents and treats its
characters, this movie recalls last
summer's "The Home and the
World." Both Satyajit Ray and Ic
hikawa seem on absolutely intimate
terms with their characters, and the
closeness is apparent in the way they
follow them, observe their move
ments and show us what the charac
ters are thinking without violating
their privacy.
Thinking back on Ichikawa's film,

one of my most vivid recollections is
of the glances exchanged by the
sisters. You sense levels of communi
cation between these women that
would seem supernatural were the at
mosphere any less intimate; their un
derstanding is rooted in their growing
up together in a very particular,
protected environment.
In the opening scenes the sisters sit
together and discuss the issues that
encompass the entire movie: the
Makioka dowry and Tsuruko's con
trol over it, Yukiko's need to find a
husband, Taeko's independence. And
for the next two hours, these themes
are turned over, examined from the
point of view of each of the sisters
and their husbands, and the varia
tions in perspective are like beautiful,
slightly different harmonies that
come together into one gorgeous
melody.
The sisters' communication is in
the way they hold their heads and
smile with their exquisitely painted
lips; these are women born and bred
on delicacies of appearance, and
they're startled when a servant
catches them laughing or someone
discovers them smoking a cigarette.
The Makiokas — particularly the
three eldest — know that they are ob
jects of contemplation, and they turn
their translucent faces and porcelain
shoulders to catch the light, or worry
over the sashes on their kimonos. But
they never seem entirely frivolous,
because their way of life has been
preserved for centuries, and we get a
sense of how fragile it is when we
hear (from the husbands) about the
industrialization of Japan, the current
war with Manchuria and the impend
ing world war (the year is 1938).
What is important to them — the
name of their family, the history of
the family business, the nuances of
personal appearance — are on the
verge of being lost forever. We see
this in Taeko, of course, but also in
Teinosuke and Tatsuo (the two eldest
daughters' husbands), who are more
pragmatic, businesslike and from a
slightly lower class than the
Makiokas.
The film shows us the ridiculous
ness and the impracticality of the
sisters' lifestyle in the modern world,
but it also mourns the loss of the
beauty and refinement they repre
sent, mirrored in the Japanese
landscapes that inhabit the movie.
The shimmering images and interplay
of colors have a never-to-be-seen
again quality that, near the end, is ab
solutely overwhelming.
It would be easy for this delicate,
alien culture to seem distanced from a
modern American audience, but the
performances draw us in, and hold us
in thrall. As the eldest, Keiko Kishi
embodies a frail strength. Tsuruko
became the surrogate parent to the
others when their mother and father
died, and she seems emotionally cut
off from all but Sachiko; her position
of authority, and that of her husband,
have alienated the two youngest, who
prefer to live with Sachiko and
Teinosuke.
Tsuruko seems distanced from us,
too, until the moment when she

agrees to leave Osaka with Tatsuo,
who has been promoted to a position
in Tokyo. She breaks down in Sa
chiko's arms and confesses she is ter
rified of letting go of the family; she
wishes she could be more of a sister to
the younger two. And Sachiko,
played by Yoshiko Sakuma, is also
humanized in this scene. She em
bodies different aspects of all the
sisters, and her character might seem
unfocused were Sakuma any less of
an actress. Sachiko's closeness to
Tsuruko in later scenes helps create
natural distinctions and allegiances
within the Makioka clan that serve to
define her and the others' characters.
We catch glimpses of Teinsuko's
attraction to Yukiko — and looking
at her, we can see why men are falling
over themselves to marry her. She
practically radiates the Makioka
qualities of sensitivity, fragility and
sensuality. You can believe that she
understands her sisters and their hus
bands better than they understand
themselves; and, even more incredi
bly, she empathizes with them. Sayuri

Yoshinaga shines in this near
impossible role, in which she is re
quired to be almost always passive,
yet alert, knowing and firm — an iron
butterfly.
Her Yukiko is usually at the center
of attention, particularly in the scenes
with the potential grooms, which are
the most overtly comic in the film.
And we recognize her pained polite
ness when she realizes that she cannot
be happy with yet another suitor; she
wants to please her sisters, but not at
the expense of an unhappy marriage.
Yuko Kotegawa's Taeko is the
most schematic of the characters;
she's the rebel sister, and her attrac
tion to men of lower social standing
seems underdeveloped, and a little
too pat. We see almost nothing of her
relationship with the bartender
(Kazunaga Tsuji) she eventually
marries, and Tsuji makes no impres
sion in his brief scenes.
Taeko's dollmaking is wonderfully
appropriate, however, and the con
nection between her exquisitely
modeled dolls and her sisters is sub

versively, subliminally funny. We
sense Taeko's conflicting loyalty to
her sisters and her desires for inde
pendence, and Kotegawa moves be
tween the worlds of modern woman
and traditional Makioka sister with
graceful ease. She even slips in and
out of her two roles while fitted in her
rigidly beautiful and proper kimono
dress; it's a delicate comedy routine.
Ichikawa balances perfectly
photographed interiors (by Kiyoshi
Hasegawa) with panoramic exteriors
of Japanese landscape in the four
seasons; they give the movie a sense
of progression, and serve as a visual
framing device. The startling pink
and lavender blossoms of the spring
give way to the subdued greens of the
summer and fall and, eventually, to
the more muted greens and greys of
winter. The falling cherry blossoms of
the spring become the melting snow
flakes of winter (the original title of
Tanizaki's novel was "A Light Snow
fair').
Ichikawa does more than open the
movie out in these scenes; he roots

the Makioka sisters in time and place,
by connecting them with the period in
Japanese culture that produced these
meticulous designs in nature. And
then he takes us inside the homes and
lives of the sisters, and shows us how
the values are eroding — or perhaps
just evolving. There's an elegant per
manency in the Makioka sistferfc
outside and dressed for appearances;
they are an incorruptible display of
femininity that looks as if it will last
forever.
And though the dramatic conclu
sion of the film takes place at a train
station, with the huge, blackened
engine bellowing steam (it's a very
harsh, modern image compared to
what we've seen up to this point), I
chikawa ends his film with a slow
motion, elegiac walk in the garden,
the sisters gliding ahead and the hus
bands trailing as shadows behind. We
see them as icons of grace and beauty,
but we know them as human beings.
Somehow, those identities fuse in our
memory and become something truly
beautiful.


Kon Ichikawa's "Makioka Sisters" paints an engaging portrait of the
lives of Japanese women entering the modern world. Not only is the

cinematography exquisite, but the characters leap out and grab you, too
— and that's not easy in this age of sequels, prequels and glitz.
Kon Ichikawa's "The Makioka
Sisters" (adapted from the novel by
Junichiro Tanizaki) engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost miraculous.
The movie chronicles one year in the
lives of four Japanese sisters, the
daughters of a wealthy, deceased ship
owner, who've established their name
and fortune in Osaka; they are the
heirs to the Makioka fortune, and
they live very comfortable, sheltered
lives.
The eldest, Tsuruko, has married a
wealthy businessman and occupies
herself with dispensing the dwindling
family finances to her sisters. The
second sister, Sachiko, concerns her
self with finding a husband for her
younger sibling Yukiko. Yukiko
meets several suitors a year, and
rejects them one by one; she lives un
der Sachiko's care, together with the
youngest sister, Taeko, who cannot
marry until Yukiko does.
The concerns of these women are
almost exclusively familial, with the
exception of Taeko, who runs a small
doll shop and maintains a degree of
self-sufficiency. And as the movie fol
lows their interactions over the
course of a year, nothing they do
seems obvious or structured in terms
of storyline, yet it all makes intuitive
sense. The film is like a walk down a
beautiful Japanese garden path; you
don't anticipate what's coming, you
just take in the wealth of patterns and
colors, and you might be surprised by
an unexpected perspective or a jux
taposition of design.
"The Makioka Sisters" may be the
epitome of what is called "seamless"
moviemaking; we follow the charac
ters and watch relationships develop
and incidents come together without
recognizing any big climactic mo
ments, any obvious payoffs. Plot
threads are dropped only to be picked
up later; characters appear with little
or no introduction, and we get to
know them as the story moves on.
The plot has little visible structure,
yet this isn't disconcerting, because
the entire movie has an emotional
flow that ties it all together. Ich
ikawa's instinct for moving from
scene to scene and character to char
acter is nearly infallible; nothing
seems emotionally truncated, and we
never feel cheated. I've seen the film
twice, and the second time there were
a few jumps and breaks in the print.
These were especially unsettling, be
cause the editing rhythms in "The
Makioka Sisters" are so delicate that
any break in the flow practically
seems a violation of nature (Chizuko
Nagata is the film editor).
