# End-of-year productions blossom
## 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
Better late than never, goes the old
saying, but I have never believed it. Never
theless, when a friend remarked to me that
Stanford doesn't seem to be as active
theatrically as other colleges, I was
prompted to write a belated article about
our on-campus theater life. Belated, be
cause the end of the quarter seems a stupid
time to be calling attention to what's already
passed. I can't resist making a point, though,
so â€” into the fray.
My friend's two main beefs are that on
campus theater doesn't abound in quality or
quantity. Well, quality is in the eye of the
beholder, and in my opinion, Stanford offers
some excellent theater opportunities. As for
quantity, a quick round-up of the shows
done this spring alone dispels the myth.
For openers we had the annual festival of
dorm musicals. Fun and frivolous, these
shows are always full of the spirit ot spon
taneity. Roble's "Pajama Game," the Row's
"South Pacific," Branner's "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum," and
Lagunita's "Fantasticks" were all great silli
ness. And if the slim budgets of these dorm
shows weren't your cup of tea, one could al
ways catch Ram's Head's "Music Man" or
the Savoyards' "Pirates of Penzance" on
"real" stages in Dink and Mem Aud. In ad
dition, several Stanford students acted last
weekend in the high-energy, ultra-hip
"Godspell," just off-campus at the Burgess
Park.
In all thest musicals, people were having
fun on both sides of the stage, something of
ten missing in "big" theater.
If this weren't enough, there was
"straight" theater like "Bent" (no pun in
tended). Easily the most emotionally
charged drama of the quarter, "Bent" con
tinued Res Ed's fine history of deeply
moving and thought-provoking productions.
Director Jim Cadena and the solid cast
deserve high marks for tackling this tough,
graphic play about gay war prisoners in Nazi
Germany. If you missed it last week, it's a
shame.

Further, we had a rare and special treat
with the visit by Theater of Yugen, a
Japanese touring company of Noh and
Kyogen theater. Once every decade or so an
established company from Japan comes over
to show their "classical" theater, and its
precise stylization was quite a change of
pace for us Westerners.
Last, but by no means least, the Drama
Department continued its growth of student
productions, offering this year a new Honors
program in directing for undergraduate
seniors, in addition to the established one
for graduate students. The result? A stirring
and visually beautiful "Of Mice and Men,"

If you feel the im
pulse to say
"Stanford's got no
live theater," stifle it.

directed by senior Reid Edelman. In addi
tion the Department hosted a sold-out sym
posium on Samuel Beckett, offering videos
and excellent live performances of "Theatre
II" and "Waiting for Godot."
On a slightly sour note, I must digress and
express my regret concerning last week's
review of "Godot." It was a misleading
piece that made the review a bigger subject
than the play itself. It short-changed the
show and was a good example of a reviewer
getting cocky and losing priorities. May such
a piece never grace The Daily's pages again.
If you missed the review, you're lucky. If

you missed the show, you're not. To me it
seems a very hard show to do without boring
the audience, and Wendy Parsons and cast
did an admirable job avoiding this easy trap.
If all this were not enough, Stanford un
dergraduates continue to look for new
theater opportunities. We have freshmen
writing and producing original plays. We
have at least two students, Andrew Barrand
Paolo Morante, performing for professional
companies in the City as well as in shows
here. We have also faculty like John Wilson
and Bill Edelman designing not only in the
Nitery and Little Theater, but in major
theaters like the Berkeley Rep, the Eureka
and the San Jose Rep as well.
So if you feel the impulse to say
"Stanford's got no live theater," stifle it. It's
just a matter of deciding not to fall back on
the omnipresent movies or routine parties
and doing something "cultural." You know,
something "cultural" like watching the lead
in a dorm musical accidentally kick the mike
across stage during a love song.
If you feel you've missed out on all the
fun, don't panic. In this last week before the
exam demons possess us and lock us in the
library there are still a few last chances to
catch theater. "The Fantasticks" plays
through tomorrow. If you like political
theater, a special class in Brechtian and
clown theater will be presenting "The Ele
phant Calf' at various spots around campus
(check Daily announcements) this week. If
you like "American Madness" or "Polish
Farce" then check out the Drama Depart
ment's first year grad student productions of
one-acts by Chrisopher Durang, Slawomir
Mrozcek, and others.
And as an appropriate end to the busy
theatrical year, Shakespeare's "Two Noble
Kinsmen" will be presented in the Nitery to
morrow through Sunday. I have a vested in
terest in this one (check the program and
you'll know why), but nevertheless it is hot
and I urge you to see it.
So take some time to relax while staying
on campus and enjoy some live theater
before the crunch sets in next week. Stan
ford theater is alive and well, thank you, and
we'll see you next year for more!
