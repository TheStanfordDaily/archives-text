# 'Desert' toys with sex
## 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
"Desert Hearts" is the kind of stale
romance picture that would be laughed off
the screen if it were about any old heterosex
ual romance. But the movie is about a love
affair between two women, and the
filmmakers — director Donna Deitch and
writer Natalie Cooper — aren't making a
simple love story, they're making a political
statement.
If we have any doubts about this in the
first half of the movie, they're dispelled when
we finally get to the big love scene; the
restrained, academic Vivian (Helen Shaver)
is hesitant and torn, but the young, ex
uberant, carefree Cay (Patricia Charbon
neau) knows that this is what they both want.
Cay finally gets Vivian into bed, and we're
relieved that their tedious courtship is over.
But when Deitch shoves her camera right
up next to their wet, drooling mouths, and
pans down their intertwined bodies for what
seems an eternity, we have nothing to do but
compare the breast sizes of the two women.
Movie moments like this have to be carefully
prepared for, because if the audience doesn't
have any emotional stake in the characters,
even moderately explicit love scenes come
across as soft-core porn.
What's so embarrassing about this scene is
not that we're watching two women making
love — it's that the moviemakers are forcing
us to watch two shallow, uninteresting
actresses make love simply to drive home a
political point. They're yelling at us, "Look
at this! Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it natural?"
And whatever humanity the characters had
is drained away: they're reduced to demon
stration models.
It's no secret that for movies to succeed as
politics they first have to succeed as art.
More specifically, a movie has to involve us
in its characters before it can make those
characters stand for anything. Deitch and
Cooper wan' to involve us in the plight of
Vivian and Cay: they try to make these two
likable and human, but they're stuck with the

godawful stereotypes they start out with.
Vivian is an English professor at Columbia
who's come to Reno in 1959 to get her
divorce. She stays at the ranchhouse of her
friend, Francis (Audra Lindley); Francis'
daughter, Cay, lives in a nearby cottage and
sculpts by day, works in a casino by night
(i.e., she has an artist's soul and a working
girl's heart). Cay is a free-an'-easy country
gal, with just one I'il ol' catch: she likes other
country gals. She's really well-loved by
everyone, and Charbonneau smiles a lot to
indicate her well-adjusted happiness. Cay is
hip and together, and, of course, she's just
what the doctor ordered for poor old uptight,
citified Vivian.
Vivian says things like "I want to be free
of who 1 am," and (defensively) "I'm a
respected member of academia!" Cay says
about Vivian, "I've finally found someone
who counts," and "She reached in and put a
string of lights around my heart." Clearly
these two were meant for each other. After
they've begun their affair, Vivian literally
lets her hair down, takes off her wedding ring
and develops a healthy glow. She exchanges
coy, knowing glances with Cay, and they
giggle together when some guys in a bar buy
them beers. And once they start asking each
other the Big Questions, like "Do you need
me like I need you?" you can practically hear
the audiences' eyes glazing over.
After movies like "Personal Best" and
"My Beautiful Laundrette" — movies in
which the characters' homosexuality is pre
sented naturally, as just one facet of their
personalities, one aspect of their lives —
"Desert Hearts" is a painfully dated (and
clumsily made) anachronism. Deitch and
Cooper are so eager to present their charac
ters' relationship as innocent and natural
that it comes across as insipid and trite. And
the people in the audience may feel trapped,
because they think that by rejecting the
movie's shoddiness they re rejecting its
sexual politics. It would be nice to belive that
we've reached the stage in our sexual think
ing where we can reject even politically cor
rect bad movies.
