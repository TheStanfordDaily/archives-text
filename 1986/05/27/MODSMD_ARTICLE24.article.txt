## OSU denies Stanford a Series berth Hurlers McDowell and Plemel shine for Cardinal in victory and defeat 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
STILLWATER, Okla. — Stanford's baseball team ad
vanced as far as it did in the Midwest Regional — to a Sun
day showdown with eventual champion Oklahoma State
— largely on the not-so-broad right shoulders of two
pitchers, Lee Plemel and Jack McDowell.
"Without those guys," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said of Plemel and McDowell, a pair of lanky right
handers who accounted for two of Stanford's three wins
here, "I don't know where we'd be. They've come
through for us all year, and they did it again.'"
So they're both Mr. Dependables. After that, the
similarities end.
In a first-round game Thursday night, Plemel (7-4 for
the year) used an array of off-speed stuff to baffle Ap
palachian State, holding the Mountaineers to eight hits as
Stanford cruised 11-1.
Plemel got ASU hitters to hit bad pitches early in the
count; he went to a three-ball count only twice. He threw
97 pitches for the ballgame. Economical, workman-like,
but not flashy.
As if Plemel's effort wasn't good enough, McDowell
pulled off some one-upmanship the next night. And he
did it with a different, more impressive, brand of pitching.
McDowell, Stanford's undisputed ace, didn't mess
around with trying to fool anybody: he just blew gas past
Arkansas. When it was over, McDowell had thrown his
third shutout of the year, allowing just four hits and strik
ing out nine while outdueling the Razorbacks' Kevin
Campbell 2-0.
McDowell, however, had to work harder for his win. He
went to three-ball counts six times; he threw in excess of
120 pitches.
Two different pitching philosophies still added up to
two wins. Not a bad one-two punch, eh?
It gets better, though. Plemel and McDowell worked
their magic in Reynold's Stadium, a home run hitters'
park par excellence. Reynold's dimensions aren't eye
opening — 396 feet to straight-away center and 330 down
the line to left — hut the wind always blows strongly out
to left. Anything can find a way out of this park.
Still, neither allowed a home run. Plemel went 18 in
nings without uncorking a gopherball (he also threw nine
frames in a 3-0 loss to Oklahoma State Sunday) and
McDowell nine.
Upon hearing that Stanford would travel to Stillwater
to play in the Midwest Regional, Asst. Coach Tom Dun
ton, the guru of the Cardinal pitchers, said, "It's not the sort of
park that suits our game. We'd much prefer a big one, a
place where pitchers can dominate."
Well, McDowell and Plemel dominated anyway.
"That's as tough as he's looked all year," said John
Ramos after catching McDowell's gem. That's saying
something. McDowell, a sophomore, finished the year
with a 11-4 iecord, the same mark he posted last year
when he was named Co-Freshman of the Year by
Baseball America.
McDowell overpowered a highly touted Arkansas
team. "I saw him pitch a lot of games last summer," said
Jeff King, the Razorbacks' standout third baseman who
played on with McDowell in the offseason, "but he was
nevtr that awesome." King entered the game hitting .391

Facing the overpowering pitching repertoire of Stanford right-hander Jack McDowell can be an unpleasant
— and unproductive — experience, as Arkansas discovered Friday night at the NCAA Midwest regional in
Stillwater, Okla. The Cardinal sophomore threw a four-hit, nine-strikeout shutout at the Razorhacks in Stan
ford's 2-0 win.
