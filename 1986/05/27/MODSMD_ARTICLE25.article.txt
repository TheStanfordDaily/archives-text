# Card wins three to reach final but falls twice to hot-hitting Cowboys
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
STILLWATER, Okla. — Before Sunday afternoons
showdown here with Oklahoma State, Stanford's baseball
team came up with what seemed to be a sure-fire way to
beat the Cowboys. It was a hell of a plan.
"We figured if we held 'em to under seven runs we
would win,"' Stanford center fielder Mark Davis said.
And the Cardinal needed to win.
Stanford entered the game with a 3-1 record in this six
team, double-elimination Midwest Regional; OSU was a
perfect 3-0. All that meant was that the Cardinal had to
beat OSU Sunday afternoon to force another, deciding
game that night between the two teams. Lose once and,
well, bye-bye.
The survivor would earn one of the eight spots in this
weekend's College World Series.
"If we could've won this afternoon," Davis, a senior,
said, "we could get a 7 o'clock game and we'd have a good
shot."
The thing is, Stanford's plan worked. Lee Piemel tossed
a five-hitter at the Cowboys . . . and limited them to three
runs. Enough to win, right?
Nope. "He pitched a great game today," Jim Ifland,
OSU's designated hitter who was hitless in four trips
against Piemel, said afterward. "He kept me off balance
all day. But you can't win if you don't score any runs."
You see, OSU's Jeff Bronkey did Piemel one better. He
spun a five-hitter of his own but didn't allow a run along
the way.
Sunday's 3-0 loss ended Stanford's season and
propelled the Cowboys to Omaha, Neb., the site of the
CWS. OSU, the tournament's top seed and a team ranked
fourth in the country by the latest Baseball America poll,
advances to the eight-team tournament for the sixth
straight year.
In the end, it was Stanford's old nemesis that caught up
with the it — punchless bats.
"We should have put forth a better performance for
Lee," Davis said. "We were always one hit away from
being right in it."
Stanford tried to do things the hard way against
Bronkey: the Cardinal didn't get a leadoff runner on base
the whole game.
In both the first and third innings, the Cardinal started
two-out rallies — only to be denied. The team also left a
runner on third in both the second and fifth frames.
"You've got to hand it to that guy (Bronkey)," Davis
said. "He came up with some great pitches when he
needed them."
Bronkey, who entered the game with a glossy 2.64
ERA, improved his season mark to 10-2 with his three
strikeout, one-walk effort. He stranded eight Cardinal
baserunners through nine innings, five in scoring position.
"Hey, he impressed me," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said of Bronkey, who allowed only two hits over
the final six innings. "He got stronger as the game went
on. We had three or four chances today, but couldn't get
the big hit."
OSU got the big hit — three big hits, really — in the
bottom of the fourth. And not one was a work of art. In
fact, it was the Rally That Never Should Have Been.
Sergio Espinal led off the inning with OSU's first hit of
the game, a bad-hop single that found the cut in the
grass and bounced high off shortstop Frank Carey's
shoulder. Cheap hit No. 1.
After Monty Fariss, a freshman shortstop, drew a
walk on a borderline full-count pitch, Robin Ven
tura, another freshman, followed with a sharply hit
groundball to first baseman Ron Witmeyer's right.
If Witmeyer, a slick fielder, corrals the ball, he's
got a routine force play at second, and maybe, if
Plemel gets over in time to cover, a double play. In
stead, the ball just skipped off Witmeyer's glove
and trickled lamely into right field. Cheap hit No.
2.
Espinal scored on the play, and Fariss moved to
third.
Ventura advanced to second on a wild pitch
before Plemel got Ifland on a comebacker. An in
tentional walk to Jimmy Barragan, a hitting terror
throughout the tournament, loaded the bases for
Scott Wilkinson.
OSU's center fielder lofted a run-scoring fly to
center for the Cowboys' second run.
Plemel was one out away — one pitch, in fact —
from escaping the inning. Bryn Kosco fisted
Plemel's 0-2 offering to shallow center. Carey
raced back and almost came up with an over-the
shoulder catch only to watch the ball fall out of his
glove for a run-scoring single. Cheap hit No. 3.
It was Plemel's only rocky inning, but it proved
to be his undoing. With the tough-luck loss, the
sophomore right-hander's record fell to 7-4.
"It was a great effort from Lee," Plemel's

catcher John Ramos, who was chosen to the All-
Tournament team, said. "He pitched with a lot of
heart out there today."
Plemel was working on only two days rest. On
Thursday Plemel had gone the distance against Ap
palachian State, winning 11-1 in a first-round game
here.
The native of Laguna Hills negotiated OSU's
formidable lineup with surprising ease. The Cow
boys led the country in scoring this year by averag
ing more than 11 runs per game, came in with a
team batting average of .342 and had pounded
Stanford the day before with a 18-hit attack,
routing the Cardinal 16-8.
"Lee did what he had to today," Ramos said.
"What you've got to do against a team like OSU is
challenge them, pitch ahead (in the count). Pitchers
want to nibble against these guys, then get behind
and have to give in."
Well, Plemel held his end of the bargain. The hit
ters? Well, they're another story altogether.
If it weren't for some late-inning heroics the
night before, however, Stanford would never have
had a chance to play OSU for the regional title.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 5-0 lead with a five
runs in the top of the fourth — on the strength of a
Witmeyer grand slam, his third home run of the
year — then watched helplessly as Oregon State
roared back.
Stanford found itself down 6-5 after six innings
against the Beavers, the champions from the Pacific
10 Conference Northern Division, in an elimina
tion game.
"We've put a lot of work into the season," Walt
Harris, Stanford's left fielder, said. "Nobody's
going to quit on it."

Least of all Harris, a senior.
Harris drilled a pair of two-run triples — in the
seventh and again in the ninth. The first led Stan
ford's comeback and the second padded the Card
inal's advantage. The Cardinal finished on top 10-
7.
Stanford's Rob Wassenaar pitched the final 2-
1/3 innings to notch the win, his seventh on the year
against one loss.
Earlier that day, Oklahoma State forced Stan
ford into Saturday night's game with Oregon State
by routing the Cardinal 16-8. Steve Chitren (2-5)
suffered the loss; David Osteen (12-3), the son of
former major leaguer Claude Osteen, got the win.
The night before, Jack McDowell, 11-4, pitched
a four-hit shutout and Carey and Davis drove in
runs as Stanford edged Arkansas 2-0.
Card notes
Ramos (10-for-20 with a home run for the
weekend), Toi Cook (8-for-21 with a homer and
seven RBI) and Jack McDowell were voted to the
All-Midwest Regional Team by a group of writers.
Six Oklahoma State players — including tourna
ment MVP Barragan — were also named to the
team.
Ed Sprague, Stanford's designated hitter, was on
fire throughout the regional. He collected 11 hits in
24 at-bats.
Stanford made a reversal of sorts over the
weekend. The usually light-hitting Cardinal — the
team had hit only 31 home runs in its 56 games
before Stillwater — hit five home runs in five
games here.

a four-hit shutout and Carey and Davis drove in
runs as Stanford edged Arkansas 2-0.
Card notes
Ramos (10-for-20 with a home run for the
weekend), Toi Cook (8-for-21 with a homer and
seven RBI) and Jack McDowell were voted to the
All-Midwest Regional Team by a group of writers.
Six Oklahoma State players — including tourna

team.
Ed Sprague, Stanford's designated hitter, was on
fire throughout the regional. He collected 11 hits in
24 at-bats.
Stanford made a reversal of sorts over the
weekend. The usually light-hitting Cardinal — the
team had hit only 31 home runs in its 56 games
before Stillwater — hit five home runs in five
games here.
STILLWATER, Okla. — Before Sunday afternoons
showdown here with Oklahoma State, Stanford's baseball
team came up with what seemed to be a sure-fire way to
beat the Cowboys. It was a hell of a plan.
"We figured if we held 'em to under seven runs we
would win,"' Stanford center fielder Mark Davis said.
And the Cardinal needed to win.
Stanford entered the game with a 3-1 record in this six
team, double-elimination Midwest Regional; OSU was a
perfect 3-0. All that meant was that the Cardinal had to
beat OSU Sunday afternoon to force another, deciding
game that night between the two teams. Lose once and,
well, bye-bye.
The survivor would earn one of the eight spots in this
weekend's College World Series.
"If we could've won this afternoon," Davis, a senior,
said, "we could get a 7 o'clock game and we'd have a good
shot."
The thing is, Stanford's plan worked. Lee Piemel tossed
a five-hitter at the Cowboys . . . and limited them to three
runs. Enough to win, right?
Nope. "He pitched a great game today," Jim Ifland,
OSU's designated hitter who was hitless in four trips
against Piemel, said afterward. "He kept me off balance
all day. But you can't win if you don't score any runs."
You see, OSU's Jeff Bronkey did Piemel one better. He
spun a five-hitter of his own but didn't allow a run along
the way.
Sunday's 3-0 loss ended Stanford's season and
propelled the Cowboys to Omaha, Neb., the site of the
CWS. OSU, the tournament's top seed and a team ranked
fourth in the country by the latest Baseball America poll,
advances to the eight-team tournament for the sixth
straight year.
In the end, it was Stanford's old nemesis that caught up
with the it — punchless bats.
"We should have put forth a better performance for
Lee," Davis said. "We were always one hit away from
being right in it."
Stanford tried to do things the hard way against
Bronkey: the Cardinal didn't get a leadoff runner on base
the whole game.
In both the first and third innings, the Cardinal started
two-out rallies — only to be denied. The team also left a
runner on third in both the second and fifth frames.
"You've got to hand it to that guy (Bronkey)," Davis
said. "He came up with some great pitches when he
needed them."
Bronkey, who entered the game with a glossy 2.64
ERA, improved his season mark to 10-2 with his three
strikeout, one-walk effort. He stranded eight Cardinal
baserunners through nine innings, five in scoring position.
"Hey, he impressed me," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said of Bronkey, who allowed only two hits over
the final six innings. "He got stronger as the game went
on. We had three or four chances today, but couldn't get
the big hit."
OSU got the big hit — three big hits, really — in the
bottom of the fourth. And not one was a work of art. In
fact, it was the Rally That Never Should Have Been.
Sergio Espinal led off the inning with OSU's first hit of
the game, a bad-hop single that found the cut in the
grass and bounced high off shortstop Frank Carey's
shoulder. Cheap hit No. 1.
After Monty Fariss, a freshman shortstop, drew a
walk on a borderline full-count pitch, Robin Ven
tura, another freshman, followed with a sharply hit
groundball to first baseman Ron Witmeyer's right.
If Witmeyer, a slick fielder, corrals the ball, he's
got a routine force play at second, and maybe, if
Plemel gets over in time to cover, a double play. In
stead, the ball just skipped off Witmeyer's glove
and trickled lamely into right field. Cheap hit No.
2.
Espinal scored on the play, and Fariss moved to
third.
Ventura advanced to second on a wild pitch
before Plemel got Ifland on a comebacker. An in
tentional walk to Jimmy Barragan, a hitting terror
throughout the tournament, loaded the bases for
Scott Wilkinson.
OSU's center fielder lofted a run-scoring fly to
center for the Cowboys' second run.
Plemel was one out away — one pitch, in fact —
from escaping the inning. Bryn Kosco fisted
Plemel's 0-2 offering to shallow center. Carey
raced back and almost came up with an over-the
shoulder catch only to watch the ball fall out of his
glove for a run-scoring single. Cheap hit No. 3.
It was Plemel's only rocky inning, but it proved
to be his undoing. With the tough-luck loss, the
sophomore right-hander's record fell to 7-4.
"It was a great effort from Lee," Plemel's

catcher John Ramos, who was chosen to the All-
Tournament team, said. "He pitched with a lot of
heart out there today."
Plemel was working on only two days rest. On
Thursday Plemel had gone the distance against Ap
palachian State, winning 11-1 in a first-round game
here.
The native of Laguna Hills negotiated OSU's
formidable lineup with surprising ease. The Cow
boys led the country in scoring this year by averag
ing more than 11 runs per game, came in with a
team batting average of .342 and had pounded
Stanford the day before with a 18-hit attack,
routing the Cardinal 16-8.
"Lee did what he had to today," Ramos said.
"What you've got to do against a team like OSU is
challenge them, pitch ahead (in the count). Pitchers
want to nibble against these guys, then get behind
and have to give in."
Well, Plemel held his end of the bargain. The hit
ters? Well, they're another story altogether.
If it weren't for some late-inning heroics the
night before, however, Stanford would never have
had a chance to play OSU for the regional title.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 5-0 lead with a five
runs in the top of the fourth — on the strength of a
Witmeyer grand slam, his third home run of the
year — then watched helplessly as Oregon State
roared back.
Stanford found itself down 6-5 after six innings
against the Beavers, the champions from the Pacific
10 Conference Northern Division, in an elimina
tion game.
"We've put a lot of work into the season," Walt
Harris, Stanford's left fielder, said. "Nobody's
going to quit on it."

Least of all Harris, a senior.
Harris drilled a pair of two-run triples — in the
seventh and again in the ninth. The first led Stan
ford's comeback and the second padded the Card
inal's advantage. The Cardinal finished on top 10-
7.
Stanford's Rob Wassenaar pitched the final 2-
1/3 innings to notch the win, his seventh on the year
against one loss.
Earlier that day, Oklahoma State forced Stan
ford into Saturday night's game with Oregon State
by routing the Cardinal 16-8. Steve Chitren (2-5)
suffered the loss; David Osteen (12-3), the son of
former major leaguer Claude Osteen, got the win.
The night before, Jack McDowell, 11-4, pitched
a four-hit shutout and Carey and Davis drove in
runs as Stanford edged Arkansas 2-0.

going to quit on it."

Least of all Harris, a senior.
Harris drilled a pair of two-run triples — in the
seventh and again in the ninth. The first led Stan
ford's comeback and the second padded the Card
inal's advantage. The Cardinal finished on top 10-
7.
Stanford's Rob Wassenaar pitched the final 2-
1/3 innings to notch the win, his seventh on the year
against one loss.
Earlier that day, Oklahoma State forced Stan
ford into Saturday night's game with Oregon State
by routing the Cardinal 16-8. Steve Chitren (2-5)
suffered the loss; David Osteen (12-3), the son of
former major leaguer Claude Osteen, got the win.
The night before, Jack McDowell, 11-4, pitched
a four-hit shutout and Carey and Davis drove in
runs as Stanford edged Arkansas 2-0.
Card notes
Ramos (10-for-20 with a home run for the
weekend), Toi Cook (8-for-21 with a homer and
seven RBI) and Jack McDowell were voted to the
All-Midwest Regional Team by a group of writers.
Six Oklahoma State players — including tourna
ment MVP Barragan — were also named to the
team.
Ed Sprague, Stanford's designated hitter, was on
fire throughout the regional. He collected 11 hits in
24 at-bats.
Stanford made a reversal of sorts over the
weekend. The usually light-hitting Cardinal — the
team had hit only 31 home runs in its 56 games
before Stillwater — hit five home runs in five
games here.
