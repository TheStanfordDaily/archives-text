# Card wins three to reach final but falls twice to hot-hitting Cowboys

### ROB GRAHAM Senior staff writer 
STILLWATER, Okla. — Before Sunday afternoons
showdown here with Oklahoma State, Stanford's baseball
team came up with what seemed to be a sure-fire way to
beat the Cowboys. It was a hell of a plan.
"We figured if we held 'em to under seven runs we
would win,"' Stanford center fielder Mark Davis said.
And the Cardinal needed to win.
Stanford entered the game with a 3-1 record in this six
team, double-elimination Midwest Regional; OSU was a
perfect 3-0. All that meant was that the Cardinal had to
beat OSU Sunday afternoon to force another, deciding
game that night between the two teams. Lose once and,
well, bye-bye.
The survivor would earn one of the eight spots in this
weekend's College World Series.
"If we could've won this afternoon," Davis, a senior,
said, "we could get a 7 o'clock game and we'd have a good
shot."
The thing is, Stanford's plan worked. Lee Piemel tossed
a five-hitter at the Cowboys . . . and limited them to three
runs. Enough to win, right?
Nope. "He pitched a great game today," Jim Ifland,
OSU's designated hitter who was hitless in four trips
against Piemel, said afterward. "He kept me off balance
all day. But you can't win if you don't score any runs."
You see, OSU's Jeff Bronkey did Piemel one better. He
spun a five-hitter of his own but didn't allow a run along
the way.
Sunday's 3-0 loss ended Stanford's season and
propelled the Cowboys to Omaha, Neb., the site of the
CWS. OSU, the tournament's top seed and a team ranked
fourth in the country by the latest Baseball America poll,
advances to the eight-team tournament for the sixth
straight year.
In the end, it was Stanford's old nemesis that caught up
with the it — punchless bats.
"We should have put forth a better performance for
Lee," Davis said. "We were always one hit away from
being right in it."
Stanford tried to do things the hard way against
Bronkey: the Cardinal didn't get a leadoff runner on base
the whole game.
In both the first and third innings, the Cardinal started
two-out rallies — only to be denied. The team also left a
runner on third in both the second and fifth frames.
"You've got to hand it to that guy (Bronkey)," Davis
said. "He came up with some great pitches when he
needed them."
Bronkey, who entered the game with a glossy 2.64
ERA, improved his season mark to 10-2 with his three
strikeout, one-walk effort. He stranded eight Cardinal
baserunners through nine innings, five in scoring position.
"Hey, he impressed me," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said of Bronkey, who allowed only two hits over
the final six innings. "He got stronger as the game went
on. We had three or four chances today, but couldn't get
the big hit."
OSU got the big hit — three big hits, really — in the
bottom of the fourth. And not one was a work of art. In
fact, it was the Rally That Never Should Have Been.
Sergio Espinal led off the inning with OSU's first hit of
