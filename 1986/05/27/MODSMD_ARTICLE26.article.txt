# Cardinal track an encouraging 7th at Pac-10s
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
It may he lonely at the top, but
it's worse at the bottom. After
spending the last few years in the
Pacific 10 Conference cellar, the
men's track team moved up to at
least the ground floor with a
seventh-place finish in last
weekend's Pac-10 championships
at USC.
The meet was won by a surpris
ing Oregon squad, which showed
some unexpected depth. Bolstered
by a first and second place finish in
the triple jump and a first and
third in the 1,500 meters, the
Ducks marched to 134 points and
a 19-point victory over second
place UCLA. Pre-meet favorite
and three-time defending cham
pion Washington State finished
third with 104.
Stanford was far off the pace for
the crown, but for the first time in
quite a while the team was really
in the competition.
"Until now we've always felt
like an uninivited guest. We've al
ways stood on the side and never
become intrusive." Stanford
Coach Brooks Johnson said.
"We're certainly not the guest of
honor now. but we know that we
can compete at the Pac-10 level."
A victory in the high jump by
Brian Marshall along with a
second in the 1.500 by Jeff Atkin
son and a third in the 10.000 by
Ryan Stoll gave the team 24
points. The rest of the squad
chipped in 13. and the Cardinal
finished with 37 points and its
highest place in years.
"We had a goal and that was to
net out of the basement. It was a

serious goal and we did a serious
job. We have to be pleased about
that," Johnson said.
Marshall's leap of 7-4 1/4 set a
Stanford record as well as a new
Pac-10 meet record and left the
Cardinal sophomore sitting as one
of the people to watch at the up
coming NCAA Championships.
Marshall had been fighting shin
splints all year. Traces of his po
tential had shone through, but un
til recently he had not put it all to
gether.
"I had a period when I couldn't
get over anything," Marshall said.
Dave Wollman, the team's high
jump coach, kept telling Marshall
that the heights would come, but
Marshall didn't believe him — un
til recently.
Two weeks ago. Marshall won
the Modesto Invitational, and that
victory gave him the confidence he
needed for the Pac -10 meet.
"I knew I could jump that high.
Now. 1 feel good about it and I
think I can go higher. It's another
big T told you so' for Dave
(Wollman)," Marshall said.
Marshall's victory made him the
Cardinal's first individual cham
pion since 1980.
In the 1,500. Atkinson, a senior,
put on his trademark 300 kick, but
it wasn't quite enough as Oregon's
Dub Myers did the same. Atkin
son had hoped to win, but he was
satisfied with his time, which
qualified him for the NCAAs.
At the NCAAs, Atkinson will
get another shot at Myers. "He's
the man to beat. The challenge has
been set and now it has to be con
quered." Atkinson said.
Stoll, another senior, will now go to
Oregon State this Thursday and at
tempt to qualify for the nationals in
his primary event, the steeplechase.
At the Pac-lOs, Stoll gave up the
steeplechase and entered the 10,000
in hopes of scoring more points for
the Cardinal.
The move worked as Stoll finished
third, good for six points, but to make
the NCAAs Stoll will have to qualify
on Thursday. He'll be accompanied
by half-milers Christian Skoog and
Brian Connoly, who will also be
hoping to qualify. Skoog finished
sixth on Saturday with a time of
1:49.65.
Other placewinners at the Pac-lOs
were Jay Thorson, who finished
fourth in the decathalon and fifth in
the 110 hurdles; Glenn Schneider,
who finished fifth in the discus; John
Gash, who placed fifth in the pole
vault; Phil Cannon, who leaped 50-0
to get sixth in the triple jump; and a
surprising 400 relay, which utilized
some picture-perfect baton passes to
slip by some higher ranked teams and
finish sixth.
For most of the team, the season is
now over. Those who have qualified
for the NCAAs will have two weeks
to train, while the rest will take some
time off and begin to look to next
year.
After last weekend's promising
performances, Johnson is hoping that
they will be able to "carry this mo
mentum and inertia over into '86-
87."
The Stanford qualifiers will be
traveling to Indianapolis for the
NCAA Championships to be held
June 4-7. The Cardinal men and
women will be competing there, as
both NCAA meets are held at the
same site.

"Until now we've always felt
like an uninivited guest. We've al
ways stood on the side and never
become intrusive." Stanford
Coach Brooks Johnson said.
"We're certainly not the guest of
honor now. but we know that we
can compete at the Pac-10 level."
A victory in the high jump by
Brian Marshall along with a
second in the 1.500 by Jeff Atkin
son and a third in the 10.000 by
Ryan Stoll gave the team 24
points. The rest of the squad
chipped in 13. and the Cardinal
finished with 37 points and its
highest place in years.
"We had a goal and that was to
net out of the basement. It was a

serious goal and we did a serious
job. We have to be pleased about
that," Johnson said.
Marshall's leap of 7-4 1/4 set a
Stanford record as well as a new
Pac-10 meet record and left the
Cardinal sophomore sitting as one
of the people to watch at the up
coming NCAA Championships.
Marshall had been fighting shin
splints all year. Traces of his po
tential had shone through, but un
til recently he had not put it all to
gether.
"I had a period when I couldn't
get over anything," Marshall said.
Dave Wollman, the team's high
jump coach, kept telling Marshall
that the heights would come, but
Marshall didn't believe him — un
til recently.
Two weeks ago. Marshall won
the Modesto Invitational, and that
victory gave him the confidence he
needed for the Pac -10 meet.
"I knew I could jump that high.
Now. 1 feel good about it and I
think I can go higher. It's another
big T told you so' for Dave
(Wollman)," Marshall said.
Marshall's victory made him the
Cardinal's first individual cham
pion since 1980.
In the 1,500. Atkinson, a senior,
put on his trademark 300 kick, but
it wasn't quite enough as Oregon's
Dub Myers did the same. Atkin
son had hoped to win, but he was
satisfied with his time, which
qualified him for the NCAAs.
At the NCAAs, Atkinson will
get another shot at Myers. "He's
the man to beat. The challenge has
been set and now it has to be con
quered." Atkinson said.
Stoll, another senior, will now go to
Oregon State this Thursday and at
tempt to qualify for the nationals in
his primary event, the steeplechase.
At the Pac-lOs, Stoll gave up the
steeplechase and entered the 10,000
in hopes of scoring more points for
the Cardinal.
The move worked as Stoll finished
third, good for six points, but to make
the NCAAs Stoll will have to qualify
on Thursday. He'll be accompanied
by half-milers Christian Skoog and
Brian Connoly, who will also be
hoping to qualify. Skoog finished
sixth on Saturday with a time of
1:49.65.
Other placewinners at the Pac-lOs
were Jay Thorson, who finished
fourth in the decathalon and fifth in
the 110 hurdles; Glenn Schneider,
who finished fifth in the discus; John
Gash, who placed fifth in the pole
vault; Phil Cannon, who leaped 50-0
to get sixth in the triple jump; and a
surprising 400 relay, which utilized
some picture-perfect baton passes to
slip by some higher ranked teams and
finish sixth.
For most of the team, the season is
now over. Those who have qualified
for the NCAAs will have two weeks
to train, while the rest will take some
time off and begin to look to next
year.
After last weekend's promising
performances, Johnson is hoping that
they will be able to "carry this mo
mentum and inertia over into '86-
87."
The Stanford qualifiers will be
traveling to Indianapolis for the
NCAA Championships to be held
June 4-7. The Cardinal men and
women will be competing there, as
both NCAA meets are held at the
same site.
It may he lonely at the top, but
it's worse at the bottom. After
spending the last few years in the
Pacific 10 Conference cellar, the
men's track team moved up to at
least the ground floor with a
seventh-place finish in last
weekend's Pac-10 championships
at USC.
The meet was won by a surpris
ing Oregon squad, which showed
some unexpected depth. Bolstered
by a first and second place finish in
the triple jump and a first and
third in the 1,500 meters, the
Ducks marched to 134 points and
a 19-point victory over second
place UCLA. Pre-meet favorite
and three-time defending cham
pion Washington State finished
third with 104.
Stanford was far off the pace for
the crown, but for the first time in
quite a while the team was really
in the competition.
