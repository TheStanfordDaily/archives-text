# California connection keys Cowboys

STILLWATER, Okla. — Even though West Coast
teams didn't fare too well here last weekend — Oregon
State was ousted Saturday and Stanford tumbled a day
later— this part of the country will be well represented
by the Midwest Regional's champion, the University of
California at Stillwater, er, Oklahoma State.
Four of OSU's eight regulars hail from California;
three of those — Jim Iflin, Robin Ventura and Jimmy
Barragan — form what OSU fans call "AirCal," the
high-flying heart of a lineup that has given more than a
few pitchers a one way ticket straight to the showers.
The three hit everything in sight this weekend; not
surprisingly they were all voted to the All-Midwest
Regional Team. Iflin was named as the tournament's
standout designated hitter, Ventura as the third
baseman and Barragan as the first baseman. Barragan
was further honored as the tournament's Most
Valuable Player.
The trio made the trek to Stillwater ready and will
ing to hit. They did it throughout the regular season,
they did it last weekend and it's a good bet that this
California connection will do the same in Omaha,
Neb., next weekend at the College World Series.
Ventura, a freshman from Santa Maria, hit a team
high .462 on the year and belted 21 homers, but Bar
ragan wasn't to be outdone. The junior from San
Diego hit .431 and led OSU with 23 round-trippers.
Ifland, a junior from nearby Santa Cruz, hit a mere
.388 with 16 dingers.
And did they ever do it to Stanford. Barragan went
5-for-6 against the Cardinal on Saturday, poking a pair
of home runs and driving in six; Ventura had three hits
that day, scored three times and knocked in two more;
and Iflin, too, joined the hit parade, going 3-for-4 with
a homer and three RBI.
But what are these guys doing in a town like Still
water, a hell-hole where temperatures routinely reach
the low 90s and the humidity won't budge from the 60-
70 percent range? Where a night on the town is a
movie — a drive-in, of course — and maybe a
milkshake or two afterward? And the bugs, wow.
"Nope. No way," said Barragan. "It's real slow out

here, I can't get used to this town. There's not much to
do."
So Barragan sticks to baseball, and he's good enough
at that, thank you. Barragan, who hits and throws left
handed, collected 13 hits in 21 trips in the regional.
/\dd to that four home runs and 12 RBI in OSU's four
games and you've got some kind of weekend.
But how much baseball can one guy stomach? Too
much of a good thing, you know.
"I've been looking for a girlfriend, something to
keep me busy," Barragan said.
"1 come from San Diego," he said, "and I miss
seeing girls in French-cut bikinis." In this neck of the
woods, overalls will have to do.
Out here guys have got to stick together. "We fit in
well with the team," Iflin said. "But it's been one hell
of a culture shock. Baseball's the only reason I'm out
here."
Ahh. That's why they come, why they leave Califor
nia behind and venture into a whole different world.
Good baseball.
OSU has earned a spot in the CWS six straight years,
and it has a winning program, a big dollar program.
The school tendered a $ 100,000 bid to host a regional;
Stanford, by contrast, submitted a $30,000-$35,000
bid.
"There are so many things, so many benefits," said
Barragan of OSU's program. "I wasn't really recruited
out of high school (Barragan transferred to OSU after
attending a junior college for a year), but when I was
offered the chance to play out here, 1 couldn't resist."
Ventura said much the same thing: "This was the
only place that would give me a good scholarship.
They're willing to take shots on people, on long shots."
One thing they won't do is stay in Stillwater long —
not after their junior year, anyway. Barragan and Iflin
both intend to try their hands in the major leagues
after this college campaign ends. Ventura's got a long
way to go, he's only a freshman. But if Barragan's ex
ample means anything, he won't be around for four
years either.
"This (college) was a stepping stone," Barragan
said. "It was my goal to have a couple of good years
here, to contribute to the school and to myself. Now,
this is my year to go."

Both Jimmy Barragan and Jim Ifland caused the Stanford pitching
staff a lot of trouble in Oklahoma State's 16-8 win over the Cardinal
on Saturday. Barragan went five-for-six with two homers and six
RBIs, while Ifland was three-for-four, including a home run.
