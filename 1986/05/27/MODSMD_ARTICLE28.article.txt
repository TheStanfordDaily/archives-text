# Celtics take Game 1

### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” Dennis
Johnson and Danny Ainge
recovered from a slow start to
combine for 22 points in the
decisive third quarter as the
Boston Celtics beat the Hous
ton Rockets 112-100 in the
opener of the NBA champion
ship series yesterday.
In the third period, Johnson
scored 12 points and Ainge 10
as the Celtics uncharacteristi
cally relied on their backcourt
during a 27-1 1 streak in the last
9:18 of the quarter. That run
turned a 65-64 Houston lead
into a 91-76 Boston advantage
The Rockets scored only 17
points and made just 36 per
cent of their shots in the third
quarter.
Robert Parish led the
balanced Boston scoring with
23 points, while Kevin McHale
and Larry Bird had 21 each.
