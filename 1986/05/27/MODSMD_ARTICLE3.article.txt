# Fire causes $12,000 damage to Mirrielees

Three Stanford students playing with matches
caused a fourth-floor Fire in Mirrielees House
Saturday afternoon that injured no one but
resulted in approximately $12,000 worth of
damage, a University official said yesterday.
The fire began in room 430, where, according
to University Fire Marshall Ray Gamma, three
students "were lighting pieces of paper, blowing
them out and then putting them into the trash
container. They thought they had put them out,
but apparently not."
Two Stanford juniors live in the apartment,
but Gamma was unwilling yesterday to release
the names of the students responsible for start
ing the fire.
Gamma said that the students, apparently not
knowing that pieces of paper were still smolder
ing in the waste basket, left the room sometime
before the Palo Alto Fire Department received
its first alarm at 4:5 1.
The fire started when the waste basket, which
was beneath a desk, began to burn and set fire
to the desk. The smoke and heat from the
flames triggered the apartment's smoke detec
tor and automatic sprinkling system, which sent
an alarm to the fire department.
Stanford junior John Staples, while visiting a

friend in Mirrielees 429, discovered the fire and
activated the hallway fire alarm, which also sent
a signal to the PAFD. Staples said that another
Mirrielees resident, Sam Sutherland, phoned in
the alarm to the PAFD.
With only the fourth-floor hall alarm sound
ing, Staples said that he, Mirrielees Resident
Assistant Noel Hanrahan and a few other stu
dents started "going along the bottom floors
ringing door bells and knocking on doors to get
everybody out."
Many Mirrielees residents either did not hear
the alarm or did not respond to it because they
thought it was a false alarm.
"It was really distant sounding. Usually when
you hear a fire alarm it sounds very loud and
near," Darcia Scott, a senior who was visiting a
friend in room 333, said. "It sounded just like
someone's smoke alarm had gone off and they
had left their door open."
According to PAFD Batallion Chief Bill
Morrill, who was on duty when the first alarm
came in, two engines, two rescue vehicles, one
fire truck, one paramedic unit and a batallion
chief (Morrill) were dispatched to the scene.
"The second alarm occurred as soon as the
first engine arrived and confirmed that there
was smoke on the fourth floor, around 4:52,"

blaze, which resulted from students playing with matches,
caused an estimated $12,000 in damage.
Morrill said Saturday.
With the second alarm, three additional fire engines
and another truck were dispatched. In all, 11 firefighting
units responded to the fire.
"That's normal procedure for what we consider a fire in
a high-rise building, anything fourth floor and up," Mor
rill said.
On Sunday, on-duty FAFD Battalion Chief Don Shaw
said the fire "probably took just seconds to control."
By 5:36 p.m. Saturday, the fire had been declared out
and Morrill had released one engine company, but Stan
ford police, who showed up on the scene at about the
same time the first fire personnel arrived, continued to
block off Escondido Road for about 100 yards on either
side of the entrance to Mirrielees.
The police maintained the blockade until around 6:15
p.m., at which time they closed off only the entrance to
Mirrielees. Before then, Stanford Police Sgt. Tim Han
rahan and his three assisting officers helped to evacuate
about 60 people from the B-wing section of Mirrielees,
where the fire occurred, and prevented them from return
ing to the building.
Fire and police officials remained on the scene until
around 7:30 p.m., but most Mirrielees residents had been
allowed to return to their rooms at least an hour before.
The bulk of the damage from the fire was caused by the
automatic sprinkling system. The sprinklers not only
flooded room 430, but they also caused water damage to
the three rooms directly below it, as water seeped through
the carpeting, the lighting fixtures and the sprinkler sys
tems in rooms 330, 230 and 130.
Residents of those apartments had to abandon their
rooms Saturday as firefighters worked frantically to cover
the rooms with protective tarpaulins. Repair work had
commenced on those rooms Saturday night, and some of
those residents had already begun returning to their
apartments Sunday.
Shaw said the sprinkler heads are designed to be activa
ted when the temperature reaches around 135 degrees,
and then they are supposed to shut off. Fire department
personnel speculated that the fire was contained by the
sprinkler system, but because the fire occurred under
neath the desk, the sprinklers could not extinguish it, so
they never went off.
In apartment 430, the sprinklers sprayed with such high
velocity that they stripped the roof of its insulating cover
ing and left a bare spot about six feet in diameter around
the water valve on the roof.
Gamma said there has been no decision yet on what ac
tion, if any, will be taken against those students respon
sible for starting the fire.
