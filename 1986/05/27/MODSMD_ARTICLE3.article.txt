# Fire causes $12,000 damage to Mirrielees

Three Stanford students playing with matches
caused a fourth-floor Fire in Mirrielees House
Saturday afternoon that injured no one but
resulted in approximately $12,000 worth of
damage, a University official said yesterday.
The fire began in room 430, where, according
to University Fire Marshall Ray Gamma, three
students "were lighting pieces of paper, blowing
them out and then putting them into the trash
container. They thought they had put them out,
but apparently not."
Two Stanford juniors live in the apartment,
but Gamma was unwilling yesterday to release
the names of the students responsible for start
ing the fire.
Gamma said that the students, apparently not
knowing that pieces of paper were still smolder
ing in the waste basket, left the room sometime
before the Palo Alto Fire Department received
its first alarm at 4:5 1.
The fire started when the waste basket, which
was beneath a desk, began to burn and set fire
to the desk. The smoke and heat from the
flames triggered the apartment's smoke detec
tor and automatic sprinkling system, which sent
an alarm to the fire department.
Stanford junior John Staples, while visiting a

friend in Mirrielees 429, discovered the fire and
activated the hallway fire alarm, which also sent
a signal to the PAFD. Staples said that another
Mirrielees resident, Sam Sutherland, phoned in
the alarm to the PAFD.
With only the fourth-floor hall alarm sound
ing, Staples said that he, Mirrielees Resident
Assistant Noel Hanrahan and a few other stu
dents started "going along the bottom floors
ringing door bells and knocking on doors to get
everybody out."
Many Mirrielees residents either did not hear
the alarm or did not respond to it because they
thought it was a false alarm.
"It was really distant sounding. Usually when
you hear a fire alarm it sounds very loud and
near," Darcia Scott, a senior who was visiting a
friend in room 333, said. "It sounded just like
someone's smoke alarm had gone off and they
had left their door open."
According to PAFD Batallion Chief Bill
Morrill, who was on duty when the first alarm
came in, two engines, two rescue vehicles, one
fire truck, one paramedic unit and a batallion
chief (Morrill) were dispatched to the scene.
"The second alarm occurred as soon as the
first engine arrived and confirmed that there
was smoke on the fourth floor, around 4:52,"


A Palo Alto fireman explains to a Mirrielees resident the
details of a small fire in that building Saturday afternoon. The

blaze, which resulted from students playing with matches,
caused an estimated $12,000 in damage.
