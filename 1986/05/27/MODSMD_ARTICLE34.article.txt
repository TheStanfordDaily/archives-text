U.S. vetoes NATO proposal
BERN, Switzerland — To the dismay of its NATO allies, the United
States exercised the lone veto Kere yesterday to block the adoption of
proposals that had been accepted by the Soviet Union to make marginal
improvements in human contacts among the 35 nations that signed the
1975 Helsinki agreements.
The proposed compromise, a compilation of many items discussed at
the conference here, called for the signator nations to speed up the is
suance of travel visas, to give special consideration to personal hardship
cases such as family illness, to publish rules and regulations on travel re
strictions and to expand contacts between East and West through group
travel, sports exchanges and sister-city relationships.
One improvement, sought by the West, would have urged that
families be allowed to travel together, instead of the usual Soviet bloc
practice of letting only some members leave home at a time. The pro
posal would also have abolished age requirements in family visits be
tween East and West, a provision targeted at East Germany's practice of
allowing only retired persons to visit relatives in the West.
Explaining the American veto at a brief news conference yesterday,
the chief American delegate to the conference, Ambassador Michael
Novak, said only that human rights proposals had not been sufficiently
matched in the past by improved performance in human contacts on the
part of the Soviet Union and East Bloc states.
Novak declined to specify the U.S. objections to the document, saying
he was too tired. But there were indications that the State Department at
the last minute had insisted on including a passage that would have
facilitated travel by ethnic minorities — a provision that could have
eased the emigration of Soviet Jews.
The clause, included in the original compromise put together by
neutral and nonaligned nations here, was earlier deleted under Soviet
bloc pressure. The U.S. delegation had gone along with that move,
mostly because the provision would have applied only to travel among
the signator nations, not to Israel, the destination of many Soviet Jews.
But then the State Department balked.
The American delegation earlier in the day had given its tentative ac
ceptance to the compromise document prepared by the nine neutral and
non-aligned countries among the 35 states. The American acceptance,
however, was subject to clearance from Washington, and when the State
Department swung into action on Memorial Day morning — by then
mid-afternoon in Bern — back came instructions that the compromise
was unacceptable.
The United States now stands alone against a European consensus
that includes Western Europe, the neutrals and non-aligned and the So
viet Union and the Eastern Bloc.
New Colombian leader vows change
BOGOTA, Colombia — Virgilio Barco Vargas, a U.S. engineering
school graduate with a reputation as a forceful administrator, said yes
terday he would use his overwhelming presidential election victory to in
itiate "a process of change benefiting those less favored" and creating "a
society more just, less unequal and more united."
With most of Sunday's ballots counted, Barco was winning by 1.6 mil
lion votes, the largest margin in Colombian history. Representing the
Liberal Party, Barco received 58 percent of the vote to 36 percent for
Conservative Alvaro Gomez Hurtado.
Barco's decisive triumph was expected to help him realize an am
bitious program of agrarian reform and economic revitalization, includ
ing more jobs and housing for the poor, projects which his predecessor,
Conservative Belisario Betancur, had also promised but failed in large
part to deliver.
A strong Liberal party showing in March congressional elections has
assured Barco an ample majority in Congress, an advantage Betancur
did not have.
One of the new president's top priorities will be to deal with Colom
bia's nagging guerrilla problem. Barco, who is to be inaugurated Aug. 7,
has signaled plans to carry on the process of dialogue begun by Betan
cur, but under more defined conditions.
Barco is reportedly inclined to offer more precise guarantees of urban
and agricultural changes advocated by the left. But he is considering
making demands, in return, that the guerrillas surrender the arms Betan
cur let them keep under earlier cease-fire agreements.
Although the issue of Colombia's active drug trade was hardly ad
dressed in the campaign, Barco has assured U.S. officials that he, like
Betancur, will support eradication programs and cooperate with U.S. ef
forts to extradite Colombians charged with trafficking.
400 die as Bangladesh ferry sinks
DHAKA, Bangladesh — At least 400 people drowned when a
double-decker ferry boat sank in the Meghna river after being battered
by a storm in southern Bangladesh Sunday night.
President Hussain Muhammed Ershad and top aides flew to the dis
aster site in southern Hijla township during the morning.
The state-run radio said that the ferry, the M.V. Samia, sank with 500
passengers when caught in a storm on the way to Dhaka from the south
ern coastal island of Bhola.
Salch Hasan, a local magistrate reached by telephone, said that divers
had recovered about 80 bodies, more than 200 people were feared
trapped inside the sunken boat, and scores carried away by the current.
Weathermen said that winds reaching about 70 mph swept the area
Sunday night, and also sank several smaller boats.
Officials of the Island Water Transport Authority said yesterday that
it could turn out to be the worst of many such tragedies that the country
has seen.
More casualties in Beirut bombings
BEI RUT. Lebanon — A mother and her son were killed yesterday in
the third bombing incident in Christian East Beirut in four days.
The blast wits similar to an explosion that injured four persons Satur
day in the East Beirut district of Sabtieh. In both incidents, a briefcase
containing about 22 pounds of TNT was placed on the second floor of an
apartment building.
On Friday, a car bomb killed 10 persons and wounded 111 others in
the teeming Sin el-Fil area. The Christian Lebanese Forces militia said
that the bombing was an attempt by Syria to terrorize the Christians into
accepting proposals put forward by Damascus for ending the 11-year
old Lebanese civil war.
The respected Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar gave credence to
reports that 20 Western hostages held by leftist Lebanese groups may be
freed as a result of European-American efforts.
A French emissary had arrived in Damascus, Syria, Sunday amid
forecasts that a release of French, and possibly American, hostages held
by Shia Lebanese groups was imminent, press reports said.
Release of hostages may be delayed
DAM ASCUS, Syria — Syrian President Hafez Assad's departure yes
terday for Athens in a rare official visit to a western country has damp
ened hopes for an imminent, Syrian-brokered release of French kidnap
victims held by Shiite Moslem activists in Lebanon.
Western diplomats here, nonetheless, said it appeared that movement
toward a two-stage release of the French hostages was under way, with
the freeing of a four-man French television crew kidnapped in March the
likely first step and release of longer-held captives coming later.
Well-informed French sources here said the case of the television
crew, seized in the Shiite suburbs of Beirut by the Revolutionary Justice
Organization, was much simpler than that of the other missing
Frenchmen, some held for more than a year.
