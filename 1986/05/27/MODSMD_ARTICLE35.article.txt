# Chernobyl death toll rises to 19

MOSCOW â€” The death toll from the accident at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant has risen to 19,
according to a senior scientist who was a key advi
ser to the cleanup team.
The figure was announced by Yevgeni Velikhov,
vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
at a press conference held one month after the acci
dent. The figure later was reported by the Soviet
news agency Tass.
It was the first official casualty update provided
here since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said
that nine people had died as of May 14.
In Vienna last week, a Soviet official said the
count had reached 15, but that figure was not re
ported here.
Velikhov, who spent two weeks in Chernobyl
directing the burying of the heavily damaged No. 4
reactor, said yesterday there was still concern about
possible contamination of ground water.
"I would not like to create an illusion that all
questions are already solved," he said. "We will
monitor all water, (particularly) in the fall and
spring when more (runoff) water flows. We will
take all possible precautions."

In general, however, he stressed that the situa
tion was under control. "I don't think at present
there are any serious surprises to come," he said.
Velikhov indicated for the first time that the So
viet Union is taking a fresh look at its nuclear en
ergy program following the Chernobyl accident.
"The Chernobyl event will influence and affect our
decisions in future technical and administrative
policies," he said.
At the same time, he reiterated the Soviet Un
ion's commitment to its nuclear program, now
poised to more than double its capacity in the next
five years.
Velikhov, pressed by western reporters for
detailed answers to several questions, gave no fur
ther specifics about the April 26 accident or its
causes, which he said would be provided in a report
by a specially appointed government commission
that could take months.
"I don't want to go into details," he said. "... it
is very difficult to get a clear picture of what is
taking place."
Velikhov indicated several times, however, that a
series of "incorrect actions" could have triggered a

chain of events, leading first to a sudden surge in
power, a release of steam and finally a hydrogen
explosion.
Soviet newspapers have given various versions of
what occurred. Yesterday, the Communist Party
paper Pravda quoted an unnamed firefighter as
saying that the first explosion was followed by
others.
The firefighter described first hearing a burst of
steam, which he said was not unusual which he
ignored. Later, after the explosions, he said he saw
a black burning ball rise up to the roof of the ma
chine room of the reactor.
Velikhov yesterday referred to the conflicting
versions and chided both the Soviet and foreign
press for "exaggerated" accounts.
In particular, he said that the explosion had not
been as powerful as some had indicated, noting that
not all windows in the reactor building had been
blown out.
Velikhov said another remaining problem was
where to bury contaminated debris from the acci
dent. He also said top soil in the contaminated zone
was being removed.
