# Reagan pays homage to war veterans

### 
WASHINGTON — In a Memorial
Day address at Arlington National
Cemetery, President Reagan yester
day invoked memories of the 1.2 mil
lion Americans who have died in the
nation's wars and counseled his fel
low citizens: "If we really care about
peace, we must stay strong.
"We must be strong enough to
create peace where it does not exist
and be strong enough to protect it
where it does. That's the lesson of this
century and, I think, of this day,"
Reagan said as he ended a solemn
five-minute talk to about 5,000 veter
ans and military personnel, who, with
their families, filled the cemetery's
neoclassic white marble Memorial
Amphitheater.
Reagan cited a galaxy of military
heroes but reserved special tribute for
those who died in Vietnam, fighting
"a terrible and vicious war without
enough support from home; boys
who were dodging bullets while we
debated the efficacy of the battle."
The president called attention to
the Vietnam Memorial across the
Potomac from Arlington, with its
black marble wall engraved with the
names of more than 58,000
Americans who died in Southeast
Asia and its statue of "three rough
boys walking together," armed
against an unseen enemy.
"It was the unpampered boys of
the working class who picked up the
rifles and went on the march,"
Reagan said. "They learned not to
rely on us. They learned to rely on
each other. . . . They chose to be
faithful. They chose to reject the fash

ionable skepticism of their time.
They chose to believe and answer the
call of duty.
"They had the wild, wild courage
of youth. They seized certainty from
the heart of an ambivalent age. They
stood for something. And we owe
them something . . . first, a promise
that, as they did not forget their mis

sing comrades, neither ever will we."
The president, accompanied by hiw
wife, began his visit to Arlington by
placing a wreath of red, white and
blue flowers before the marble Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier as an honor
guard in dress blues stood at atten
tion.
In opening his talk, Reagan called

the cemetery, with its gentle green
slopes flecked with marble markers
and little American flags set out to
mark the day, "a fitting place for
some remembering."
Among the "men and women who
led colorful, vivid and passionate
lives" who now rest at Arlington,
Reagan recalled Adm. William
"Bull" Halsey, Adm. William Leahy
and Gen. Omar Bradley, leaders.of
victorious U.S. forces in World War
II; Gen. John "Black Jack" Pershing,
commander of the American Expedi
tionary Forces in World War I; cham
pion heavyweight boxer Joe Louis,
who forsook the ring for the Army
after Pearl Harbor, and Audie
Murphy "of the wild, wild courage,"
the most decorated serviceman to
survive World War 11.
Reagan recalled the "mature and
measured courage" of Challenger
astronauts Michael Smith and Francis
Scobee, who were buried at Ar
lington after they died Jan. 28 in the
disastrous explosion of the space
shuttle. Reagan closed the roster with
the name of Oliver Wendell Holmes,
a thrice-wounded captain in the Un
ion Army before he served 30 years
on the Supreme Court.
"All of these men were different,"
Reagan said, "but they shared this in
common: They loved America very
much. There was nothing they
wouldn't do for her, and they loved
with the sureness of the young. . . .
It's the young who do the fighting and
dying when the peace fails and a war
begins."
