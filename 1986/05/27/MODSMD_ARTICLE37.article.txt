Access to data limited
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon, concerned
about the flow of high technology to the Soviet
bloc, is trying to limit foreign access to govern
ment and commercial computer data bases that
contain sensitive technical information.
A range of legal and technological options are
now under exploration, from licensing access to
high-tech data bases to planting special computer
programs within the data bases to monitor who is
seeking what information.
Government officials concede, however, that
they face formidable obstacles in devising a
workable system, including such questions as
whether data bases enjoy the same constitutional
protections as other media and how to implement
restrictions in ways that won't deny data-base
benefits to American users.
The effort stems from a growing perception in
the defense community that the export of high
technology data should be as strictly controlled as
the export of high-technology goods.
Soviet scientists have publicly confirmed that
they regularly gain access to U.S. computer data
bases through overseas telephone hookups to
keep up to date with advances in key technolo
gies plus useful software that often resides in such
systems.
These data-base systems, employing sophisti
cated computer software, enable users to retrieve

in seconds reams of important technical data that
would otherwise take months of painstaking li
brary research. Data-base retrieval has become
an indispensable tool of the international re
search community.
These systems, ranging from data bases housed
in the national laboratories to commercial offer
ings from companies such as Dialog Inc. and
Mead Data Central's Nexis, provide data from
such fields as biotechnology, electrical engineer
ing, materials science and high energy particle
physics, as well as access to useful computer
software.
At this time, such Soviet bloc data-base
retrieval violates no laws, which has prompted
the national security community to consider
countermeasures.
One approach is to create a new classification
of technical data to put it beyond the reach of or
dinary data-base access. The National Telecom
munications Information Systems Security Com
mittee (NTISSIC), an interagency group chaired
by Latham, is expected to recommend the crea
tion of a category of data — called "sensitive" —
for federal agencies to implement. These data,
defined as potentially related to national security,
would require a special password or other
method for data-base access.
The Reagan Administration has already taken
steps to deny foreign nationals access to high
technology data. The Pentagon recently ruled

that Soviet scientists should not be allowed to use
supercomputers in this country.
7 million link hands
Up to 7 million people joined Hands Across
America's fragmented chain as it stretched across
the nation and abroad, its chief organizer said
yesterday, and he urged participants to "roll up
your sleeves" and keep working for the needy.
Officials stuck to their target figure of raising
$50 million or more to help the hungry and
homeless but said it may take all summer to
count donations.
Organizers estimated upwards of 4.9 million
Americans clasped hands in the line from Cali
fornia to New York, while millions more partici
pated in related events in off-route states and
foreign countries.
There were gaps throughout the 4,152-mile
line, especially in the deserts of the Southwest
and even in urban areas. Organizers had esti
mated 5.4 million people would be needed to
complete it.
"The connection that was most important was
made," said Kragen. "The physical connection
was nowhere near as important as the connection
between the issues of hunger and homelessness.
That line was connected in spirit, and I defy
anybody to tell me it wasn't."
