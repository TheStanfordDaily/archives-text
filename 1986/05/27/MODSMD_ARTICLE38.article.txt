Lyng rips protectionism
SAN FRANCISCO — Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng said yesterday that President
Reagan will "almost certainly" veto the "highly
protectionist" Democratic trade bill passed last
week by the House of Representatives if it
receives Senate approval.
Lyng criticized the bill, which would force the
president to use tariffs or quotas to combat unfair
trade practices by foreign companies. He said it
would "hamstring the efforts of agricultural
people in the United States" for free trade
reforms.
The bill passed the House last Thursday by a
vote of 295 to 115. with 59 Republicans crossing

party lines to support it.
Lyng attacked the bill in a strongly anti
protectionist address to nearly 1,500 members of
the International Seed Trade Federation at a
conference in the St. Francis Hotel.
"The United States is firmly committed to
regaining its fair share in international markets,"
he said. Lyng said the Reagan Administration's
campaign against restrictions on free trade in the
U.S. and in other countries is the key to Ameri
can agricultural prosperity.
"The American farmer has become vulnerable
to forces far beyond his control in the interna
tional market," Lyng said.
"There is a growing frustration around the
world over the lack of enforceable rules" against

protectionist measures, he said.
The Carter Administration's grain embargo
against the Soviet Union, and the 1981 farm bill
passed by Congress legislating agricultural price
supports, were cited by Lyng as examples of the
kind of protectionism his administration is trying
to dismantle.
Today's weather
Morning low clouds and fog today with local
drizzle along coast. It will be mostly sunny this af
ternoon with highs in the 60s to 80s. Westerly af
ternoon winds to 25 mph. Tomorrow will be
sunny and warmer.
