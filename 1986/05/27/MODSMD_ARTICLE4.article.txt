# Round II advances many
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ 
According to Round II results
released today, the housing fortunes
of both men and women in the under
graduate Draw remained consistent
with prior years, and houses that in
previous years have struggled to fill
their spaces survived another year.
The Housing Center also will
release results for the summer
housing draw and the graduate lot
tery today.
The undergraduate Draw revealed
that Terra and the French house filled
completely while Synergy has three

male spaces left. The two co-ops and
the theme house were on a warning
list and would have become standard
University housing if they were not
filled.
The co-op Columbae, which was
not on the warning list, surprised
housing officials with its large number
of female vacancies.
For those undergraduates who
were unassigned after Round 1 or un
satisfied with their housing assign
ments, the release of second round
results may offer some solace.
As Stanford men completed their
annual migration to fraternities.

Round II saw the usual dramatic
change in male housing fortunes —
the cut-off for University housing
rose from 3,001 at the end of the first
round to 3,806. For women, the cut
off shifted from 3,333 to 3.564.
Some of the cut-off points for the
second round were:
• Alpha Sig — Men: 1,501; Women:
1.429: both with level-3 priorities:
• ATO — Men: 965: Women: 888:
both with level-2;
• 558 Mayfield — Men: 136;
Women: 274;
• Kairos — Men: 2,532; Women:
2,165; both with level-2.
• Murray — Men: 954: Women:
842;
• Roble — Men: 543; Women:
854;
• Toyon — Men: 321: Women:
207; both with level-2.
"In the next stage of the housing
process, everybody has to do
something," Rodger Whitney, as
sistant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Housing Center,
said. "If you live on campus, fill
out Draw Card Three at your local
housing office. If you live off
campus, come to the housing cen
ter."
Students with assignments have
three options in response to
Round II results. They can simply
accept their assignment, they can
accept their assignment and join a
new wait-list, or they can refuse
their assignment and drop out of
the Draw.
"June 6 is the final day for ac
tion," Whitney cautioned.
Unassigned students also have
several options. They can attend
the Off-Campus Spring Clearing
House on May 27-30 at the
Housing Center, they can join the
new wait list, or they can wait for

walk-in sign-ups on the first
Thursday of fall quarter.
"While the housing system may
seem complicated," Whitney said,
"we value the diversity of experi
ence that our housing system of
fers."
Including fraternities, under
graduate housing allows students
to choose among 54 different
residences, according to Whitney.
In the summer housing Draw,
95 percent of all participating stu
dents obtained their first choice of
residence.
"It looks like there will be
plenty of housing for people who
need it,"he said.
Although it does not possess the
"pomp and circumstance" of the
undergraduate Draw, the graduate
lottery provides housing for 40
percent of all graduate students.
Graduate housing options in
clude Escondido Village, Mir
rielees, Crothers, Crothers
Memorial, the co-ops and Man
zanita.
Eighty percent of the graduate
students who applied for housing
this year were assigned.
In an attempt to minimize stress
on young parents, graduate
housing has a goal, as yet unmet,
of assigning residences to all
families with children before the
fall.
