# Round II advances many
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ 
According to Round II results
released today, the housing fortunes
of both men and women in the under
graduate Draw remained consistent
with prior years, and houses that in
previous years have struggled to fill
their spaces survived another year.
The Housing Center also will
release results for the summer
housing draw and the graduate lot
tery today.
The undergraduate Draw revealed
that Terra and the French house filled
completely while Synergy has three

male spaces left. The two co-ops and
the theme house were on a warning
list and would have become standard
University housing if they were not
filled.
The co-op Columbae, which was
not on the warning list, surprised
housing officials with its large number
of female vacancies.
For those undergraduates who
were unassigned after Round 1 or un
satisfied with their housing assign
ments, the release of second round
results may offer some solace.
As Stanford men completed their
annual migration to fraternities.

Round II saw the usual dramatic
change in male housing fortunes —
the cut-off for University housing
rose from 3,001 at the end of the first
round to 3,806. For women, the cut
off shifted from 3,333 to 3.564.
Some of the cut-off points for the
second round were:
• Alpha Sig — Men: 1,501; Women:
1.429: both with level-3 priorities:
• ATO — Men: 965: Women: 888:
both with level-2;
• 558 Mayfield — Men: 136;
Women: 274;
