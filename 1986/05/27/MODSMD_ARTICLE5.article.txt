# LSJUMB loses its voice
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
There have always been a few constants in the other
wise unpredictable football game performances of the
l.eland Stanford Junior University Marching Band

Feature

(LSJUMB) â€” wild, chaotic formations; loud, chaotic
music: and loud, chaotic neckties.
And the Voice. That Voice, booming over the public
address system in eloquent self-mockery, attempting to

impose some meaning on the Band's occasionally
meaningless formations.
For the last 10 years running, and for several years
off and on before that, the voice of the Band, familiar
to friend and foe of Stanford alike, has belonged to Hal
Mickelson.
Mickelson made his first appearance as Band an
nouncer in 1969, when he was a Stanford junior. He
has continued steadily in the position ever since, with
the exception of a five-year hiatus during and just after
studying at Harvard Law School in
the early 19705.
But Mickelson has officially retired
as Band announcer, and now the
LSJUMB is seeking a new voice for
the fall.
Mickelson, currently a corporate
attorney for Hewlett-Packard, has al
ways been an anomoly in what is al
most wholly a student organization.
He says the Band "will be way
ahead" by getting a new announcer.
"I have had an indecent amount of
fun being the Band announcer," says
Mickelson. "But the most important
issue is the Band's performance and

its ability to entertain its audience.
I'm afraid that I was getting a little
stale."
"Hal thought that the Band was
relying on him too much . . . there
was a lot of responsibility placed on
him," says assistant Band manager
Todd Olson.
"Hal feels like it's time for some
new blood," says Band manager Jeff
Stevens. "I think Hal has been the
backbone of the band in many ways
for the last 15 years."
According to Stevens, the Band has
sometimes relied on Mickelson's
quick wit and glib delivery to rescue
mediocre shows.
"The Band has a saying during

reheai'sals," Stevens explains. "After
a bad formation, they shout, 'And
Hal will say something funny."
"There have been times when the
Band has ridden Hal's humor."
Mickelson downplays his own im
portance to the group.
"A lot of my routine was a one
joke concept," he says."It was a sort
of a parody of the baroque announc
ing style of traditional marching
bands . . . using grand language to
describe insignificant trifles."
Replacing Mickelson will be no in
significant trifle for the current Band
staff.
"The announcing position is very
important to the Band," says Stevens.
"We know we're not going to find an
other Hal Mickelson . . . but we hope
we'll find someone who will create a
niche."
"With the Stanford Band, you have
to have a good announcer," says Ol
son. "The Band is supposed to be
funny, and sometimes that requires
words."
"The announcer ties the show to
gether and makes it funny/' says drum
major Brian Pike. "Usually the
formations need some explanation."
Mickelson envisions a successor
with a style quite divergent from his
own.
"The person that's right for the
Band will do something very different
from me," he says."The more differ
ent, the better. I'm not stepping aside
so the Band will find someone just
like me."
To Mickelson, the primary pre-re
quisite for the job is an appreciation
of the Band.
"First and foremost, the person

ought to love the Band, the Band's
music, the Band's style of doing
things. . . . When I came in, that's all I
had going for me."
Mickelson says he accepted the job
back in 1969 with the understanding
that he was going to do it for one
week as a "temporary fill-in." He
ended up staying on for some 16
years.
Stevens says the Band, in replacing
Mickelson, is hoping "to groom
someone who might be there for a
while." But there are other consider
ations as well.
"We're looking for the obvious
things," says Pike. "A person who is
funny, who has a good voice, a very
interesting voice; someone who has a
really good vocabulary and can think
quick and be funny quick."
Olson explained that in the appli
cation process, the staff is "trying to
mimic what the announcer has to do"
for an ordinary football game.
Applicants will be supplied with
the outline of a show, and will then be
expected to come up with their own
scripts. While Mickelson usually ex
temporized his spiels from notes
scribbled on the back of an envelope,
Olson says that new applicants will
probably want to "sit down and plan
it out to the last 'of and 'the.' "
Mickelson's duties weren't
restricted to show narration,
however. He has also provided rally
speeches at pre-game rehearsals and
events like last November's Big
Game Bonfire. Prospective succes
sors will be asked to deliver a two- to
four-minute speech pretending
they're at the Bonfire rally, according
to Pike.

Hal Mickelson, the voice of the Stanford Band since 1969, has decided
to keep quiet. Beginning in the fall, the LSJUMB will have a new voice
to explain its occasionally inexplicable antics.
