# ASSU funding policy changed
## 3.3 percent of students vote 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU's financial policy re
garding student organizations tunds
will undergo major changes as a
result of the outcome of last week's
special election.
About two-thirds of the 440 voters
— 3.3 percent of the student body —
passed a binding referendum to
"require the ASSU to pay a fair inter
est rate to student groups that are
forced to bank with the ASSU."
Election Commissioner Robin Mil
ler blamed the meager turnout on the
"low amount of publicity" for the
election.
"Since there was really only one
concerned party in this election, there
wasn't very much publicity," Miller
said. "Lots of students felt this issue
didn't directly concern them," so not
many were likely to vote on it, he
said.
The total cost of holding the special
election is estimated at $2,909. The
actual cost will be available today, but
it should only change the estimation
by about $100, according to Miller.
Miller said the cost of the election
per registered student at Stanford is
estimated at 23 cents, while the cost
of the election per student who actu
ally voted is about $6.61.
"It is unfortunate that [the elec
tion] cost that much," said Richard
Beigel, who sponsored the issue in
the senate.
Saying he is "glad the change was
made," Beigel added, "I'm glad
enough people thought it mattered
and showed up and voted." Beigel

said he believes next year's ASSU
Senate will follow through on the
measure.
ASSU Financial Manager Duncan
Weaver called the election "a big
waste of money." ,
"I don't think the referendum is
very meaningful," he said.
"Depending on how the senate
decides to interpret the word
'competitive,' student groups could
actually be getting lower interest
rates as a result of this referendum.''
Weaver noted that interest rates
have been going down recently, so a
"competitive" rate could be less than
what student groups currently
receive.
The referendum provides three dif
ferent kinds of accounts to student
groups, required under University
policy to bank with the ASSU.
Savings accounts, money market
savings accounts and one-year certif
icates of deposit must offer interest
rates "competitive with the rates of
fered on similar available accounts .at
nearby banks and savings and loan
associations," the referendum says.
Competitive interest rates cur
rently add up to 5.5 percent on
savings accounts, 6.5 percent for
money-market accounts with a mini
mum balance of $1,000 and 8.0 per
cent on one-year, fixed-rate certif
icates of deposit. These rates "may be
set or amended by the Senate by a
majority vote."
Because overseas ballots could not
be tallied in time for the Saturday
deadline, according to Miller, all
votes are from registered students on
campus.
