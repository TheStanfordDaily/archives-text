# Davies: Stanford provoked suit
## 
### KENNETH FENYO Senior staff writer 
Norman Davies, visiting professor
of history, yesterday charged that
University authorities provoked his
$3 million lawsuit by delaying the
release of an official letter explaining
the reasons for his tenure denial.
Davies, in a letter to The Daily,
responded to charges by University
Officials that his suit is without merit.
In the Provost's Letter of Explana
tion, Provost James Rosse called
Davies suit an "egregious piece of
behavior."
Davies wrote yesterday that "by
repeatedly delaying the long
promised Letter of Explanation
beyond the agreed and reasonable
term, it could well have been the
Stanford authorities who knowingly
and egregiously provoked the law
suit."
The Provost's letter, originally
slated to be available on April 22,
was not completed until May 2.
Although Davies accused the Uni
versity of delaying the release of the
Letter of Explanation, Rosse said he
never "promised the letter would be
time-definite."
"(Davies) knows we got the letter
to him as fast as we could," Rosse
said.
A prominent expert on the history

of Polanu and director of Stanford's
new overseas program in Krakow,
Davies filed suit April 28 against His
tory Prof. Harold Kahn and 30 other
members of the department, who he
alleges denied him a vacant endowed

position in Eastern European studies
because of his treatment of Polish-
Jewish relations in a chapter of his
highly regarded 1981 book, "God's
Playground: A History of Poland."
Because Davies is a visiting profes
sor, he does not qualify for the Uni

versity's internal process of grievance
and appeal. Rosse has promised,
however, to review the case as a mat
ter of courtesy.
Davies states in his letter that while
he was waiting for the official expla-

nation, he instructed his lawyer,
former Republican Congressman
Pete McCloskey, not to file suit "so
long as the Stanford authorities were
showing reasonable intent of granting
an internal hearing."
Given that his present stay at Stan

ford is due to end in mid-June,
Davies decided he did not have the
time to wait for the Provost's report.
"It is not difficult, I think, for any
fair-minded person to decide whether
my action was characterized by
egregiousness or by patience,"
Davies wrote.
Davies outlined the history of his
dealings with the University, saying
he would allow "the sequence of
events to speak for itself':
• On Feb. 26, Stanford's Staff Coun
sel advised Davies to consult a private
lawyer. For the previous six weeks,
"all the lower levels of the Stanford
administration had responded to my
enquiries with a stone wall of
silence," Davies wrote.
• On March 22, Davies wrote Rosse
formally requesting an explanation of
the academic grounds on which he
had been rejected by the faculty of
the History Department.
• On April 18, Rosse spoke with
Davies and promised the Letter of
Explanation would be available early
the next week. Stanford's legal coun
sel confirmed in writing that the letter
would be available by April 22.
• On April 24, Rosse "openly ad
mitted, 'We've blown it.' " Rosse
promised both an internal hearing
and the delivery of the letter by the
end of the next week, Davies wrote.
