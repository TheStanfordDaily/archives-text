						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Put squeeze on Pretoria 
### 
In the latest episode of South Africa's continual use
of economic, political and military force against its
neighbors, South African military forces last week at
tacked the capitals of Botswana, Zambia and Zim
babwe. According to South Africa officials, these in
cursions into the territory of three sovereign neighbor
ing nations were part of a drive against the "guerillas"
of the African National Congress (ANC). The coor
dinated raids were the most extensive military action
taken by Pretoria in its 25-year war against the ANC,
the most prominent of the exiled and banned opposi
tion movements seeking the overthrow of the white
minority government.
The recent actions and claims of the South African
government, as well as its past ones, must be strongly
condemned. While Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe
openly support the ANC, they deny harboring its
members. Additionally, whereas the South African
government has said that the target of the raids was the
"terrorist transit facilities" of the ANC, Zambia asserts
that the military commandos hit a United Nations
refugee camp near Lusaka. Moreover, Pretoria's claim
that it was only acting in self-defense, as the United
States claimed to have done in its attack on Libya,
neglects to mention that the ANC operates from
abroad only because it is outlawed in South Africa.
Pretoria's latest action only serves to isolate itself
further from the rest of the world and to increase
doubts as to the sincerity and willingness of the South
African government to enter into negotiations with the
black opposition. Indeed, the raids were undertaken at
the same time that a group of Commonwealth repre
sentatives was in South Africa attempting to set up
talks between the white minority government and the
ANC. Instead of pursing a peaceful process of change
through negotiations with Nelson Mandela and other
black leaders, Pretoria has chosen to pursue its sup
porters across its borders.
These raids — in addition to jeopardizing diplomatic

efforts currently underway — also exposed the inade
quacy and ineffectiveness of the Reagan Administra
tion's policy of "constructive engagement." This
policy, which contends that dialogue and persuasion
are more likely to coax Pretoria away from apartheid
than confrontation, has shown few results. It obviously
has not restrained South Africa from attacking its
neighbors and has produced only minimal efforts
toward the dismantling of apartheid. The Uniteu
States, as well as the South African government, must
therefore change its polices if there is to be any hopes
of a peaceful solution to the situation in South Africa.
When the Reagan Administration first expressed
"outrage" at last week's raids, and said that it was con
sidering other steps to increase the pressure on the
South African government, it appeared as if it were
going to take a harder line against Pretoria. However,
the White House has acted only to oust Pretoria's
ranking military representative in Washington and to
veto a United Nations Security Council resolution call
ing for mandatory sanctions against Pretoria.
It is clear that Pretoria is not responding to calls for
negotiations and that the cunent policy of constructive
engagement is not working. The United States must
move to place more political and economic pressures
on South Africa to help end apartheid as quickly and
peacefully as possible. The least that should be ex
pected is the recall of the United States ambassador
from Pretoria as occurred in June 1985 during South
Africa's last cross-border violence. His return should
also be made conditional upon the release of black
South African political prisoners and the beginning of
a negotiation process between the white minority gov
ernment and the black opposition. The United States
must also respond to the call for economic sanctions as
demanded by more than three quarters of black South
Africans, including Bishop Desmond Tutu.
The longer the United States and Pretoria wait, the
more suffering, violence and bloodshed there will be.
