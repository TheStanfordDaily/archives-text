How to live
with someone
who's living
with cancer.
When one person gets
cancer, everyone in the family
suffers.
Nobody knows better than we
do how much help and
understanding is needed That's
why our service and rehabilitation
programs emphasize the whole
family, not just the cancer patient.
Among our regular services
we provide information and
guidance to patients and families,
transport patients to and from
treatment, supply home care items
and assist patients in their return to
everyday life
Life is what concerns us The
life of cancer patients The lives of
their families. So you can see we
are even more than the research
organization we are so well known
to be.
No one faces cancer alone
