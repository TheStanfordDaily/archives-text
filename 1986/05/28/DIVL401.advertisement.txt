I An open letter to our customers
We've Changed Our Minds
We announced that we were going out of business,
but now we're not. We didn't have our fingers crossed.
We didn't have anything up our sleeves. The tides of
business simply changed. We're no longer pursuing
opportunities elsewhere. Instead, you're going to continue
I to get the same bargains and the same service you've
come to expect from us these last ten years.
But Not Our Prices
You'll be glad to know that the flood of inventory
arriving back in Palo Alto means we don't dare raise our
j sale prices. It means you'll find exciting new products,
like Jimmy'Z beachwear and Hind Wells athletic wear.
And it means a new policy that you should like: Now
Dealin' Down is All Discount All the Time. Same high
quality merchandise, but we'll always try to give you the
best price you can find on the things you want.
We'd like to thank the hundreds of you who
expressed regret when we told you we were leaving. Your
kind words and warm wishes weren't what made us stay,
but they sure have made us feel like working hard for you
now that we're back.
Sincerely,
Steve Singer Charles Tips
