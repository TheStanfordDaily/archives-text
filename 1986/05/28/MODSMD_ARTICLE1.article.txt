# Profs. discuss tenure

New, more demanding criteria
imposed upon University candidates
for tenure set impossible standards
that junior faculty members cannot
hope to meet.
Such was the feeling of some
humanities professors following the
History Department's January deci
sion to deny tenure to Asst. Prof.
Stephen Ferruolo, despite a unani
mous recommendation by a depart
ment review committee.
Ferruolo, who last week decided to
appeal the decision, is the first history
professor to be judged under new
guidelines, formulated last year by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norm Wessels, which demand that
candidates for tenure be compared to
"senior scholars" in the same field,
and not merely persons "who ob
tained the doctoral degree at about
the same time as the candidate."
The basis of Ferruolo's appeal is
that such a comparison — which
raises the standards beyond
guidelines in the 1984 faculty hand
book instructing comparison only
with the "peers" of a tenure candi
date — is unrealistic and unfair.
Scholars outside of the University,
who are asked to serve as "referees,"
now find it difficult to recommend
any professor in the early stages of
academic development, said Fer
ruolo. a specialist in medieval history.
" The policy (of redefining tenure
requirements) was approved by two
provosts and the advisory board,"
