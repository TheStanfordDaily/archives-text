# Profs. discuss tenure
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
New, more demanding criteria
imposed upon University candidates
for tenure set impossible standards
that junior faculty members cannot
hope to meet.
Such was the feeling of some
humanities professors following the
History Department's January deci
sion to deny tenure to Asst. Prof.
Stephen Ferruolo, despite a unani
mous recommendation by a depart
ment review committee.
Ferruolo, who last week decided to
appeal the decision, is the first history
professor to be judged under new
guidelines, formulated last year by
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norm Wessels, which demand that
candidates for tenure be compared to
"senior scholars" in the same field,
and not merely persons "who ob
tained the doctoral degree at about
the same time as the candidate."
The basis of Ferruolo's appeal is
that such a comparison — which
raises the standards beyond
guidelines in the 1984 faculty hand
book instructing comparison only
with the "peers" of a tenure candi
date — is unrealistic and unfair.
Scholars outside of the University,
who are asked to serve as "referees,"
now find it difficult to recommend
any professor in the early stages of
academic development, said Fer
ruolo. a specialist in medieval history.
" The policy (of redefining tenure
requirements) was approved by two
provosts and the advisory board,"

meeting, the final session of the outgoing senate. In other business, the senate approved a measure that will al
low students seeking to set up an alternative donation fund to use the ASS LPs tax-exempt status. The new sen
ate will take over at a meeting tonight.
Wessels said last night. "And no ref
eree has complained about it."
He declined to comment specifi
cally on Ferroulo's case.
But the feeling among some
scholars in various humanities de
partments is that Ferruolo's com
plaints are justified.
"(The new standards) make
outside scholars hesitate — it makes
them much more cautious," History
Prof. Gavin Langmuir said yesterday.
Langmuir, one of the members of the
History Department committee that
originally recommended Ferruolo for
tenure, said that while a candidate in
the sciences might be accurately
critiqued in an early stage of develop
ment, it is difficult to discern bril
liance in a young humanities scholar.
He stated that "there should be
reconsideration" of the new criteria,
with advice sought from members of

different departments. Long-term ef
fects of the more difficult standards
could include a "two-tiered" system
in some departments, where junior
faculty with little chance of receiving
tenure are considered "second class
citizeas," he said.
Such conditions exist at institutions
such as Harvard and Yale, Langmuire
said.
"(The new criteria) is a step in that
direction (of conditions at Harvard),"
Political Science Prof. John Manley
said yesterday."And Harvard's
policy is not one Stanford wants to
emulate."
But History Prof. David Kennedy
asserted last night that Wessels' new
standards "are not new" and repre
sent a move toward more fairness and
consistency in tenure evaluations.
"They're really just a clarification
of what the criteria have always
been," Kennedy said, explaining that
the only difference was the decision
to compare candidates with all top
scholars at a time when they were at

similar levels of development.
The past system called for a com
parision only with "chronological
contemporaries," Kennedy said, add
ing that such a method is less arbi
trary because "it doesn't just depend
on who's around at the time."
"It's grossly inaccurate to say Wes
sels' criteria asks for a comparison of
junior scholars with senior scholars as
they now sit," Kennedy said.
Manley flatly dismissed the notion
that the new standards were only a
clarification of existing criteria for
tenure, charging the University ad
ministration with having an
"inferiority complex."
"The University is placing an in
creased emphasis on 'being number
one,' and as we move to that goal,
everything is bent to it, such as teach
ing and a balanced faculty," Manley
said. "Ferruolo and others have been
caught in the administration's grind
because they t won't contribute to an
'external validation' of Stanford."

Council of Presidents members Tim Quirk (left) and Mike Collins add some fun to last night's ASSU Senate
meeting, the final session of the outgoing senate. In other business, the senate approved a measure that will al
low students seeking to set up an alternative donation fund to use the ASS LPs tax-exempt status. The new sen
ate will take over at a meeting tonight.
Wessels said last night. "And no ref
eree has complained about it."
He declined to comment specifi
cally on Ferroulo's case.
But the feeling among some
scholars in various humanities de
partments is that Ferruolo's com
plaints are justified.
"(The new standards) make
outside scholars hesitate — it makes
them much more cautious," History
Prof. Gavin Langmuir said yesterday.
Langmuir, one of the members of the
History Department committee that
originally recommended Ferruolo for
tenure, said that while a candidate in
the sciences might be accurately
critiqued in an early stage of develop
ment, it is difficult to discern bril
liance in a young humanities scholar.
He stated that "there should be
reconsideration" of the new criteria,
with advice sought from members of

different departments. Long-term ef
fects of the more difficult standards
could include a "two-tiered" system
in some departments, where junior
faculty with little chance of receiving
tenure are considered "second class
citizeas," he said.
Such conditions exist at institutions
such as Harvard and Yale, Langmuire
said.
"(The new criteria) is a step in that
direction (of conditions at Harvard),"
Political Science Prof. John Manley
said yesterday."And Harvard's
policy is not one Stanford wants to
emulate."
But History Prof. David Kennedy
asserted last night that Wessels' new
standards "are not new" and repre
sent a move toward more fairness and
consistency in tenure evaluations.
"They're really just a clarification
of what the criteria have always
been," Kennedy said, explaining that
the only difference was the decision
to compare candidates with all top
scholars at a time when they were at

similar levels of development.
The past system called for a com
parision only with "chronological
contemporaries," Kennedy said, add
ing that such a method is less arbi
trary because "it doesn't just depend
on who's around at the time."
"It's grossly inaccurate to say Wes
sels' criteria asks for a comparison of
junior scholars with senior scholars as
they now sit," Kennedy said.
Manley flatly dismissed the notion
that the new standards were only a
clarification of existing criteria for
tenure, charging the University ad
ministration with having an
"inferiority complex."
"The University is placing an in
creased emphasis on 'being number
one,' and as we move to that goal,
everything is bent to it, such as teach
ing and a balanced faculty," Manley
said. "Ferruolo and others have been
caught in the administration's grind
because they t won't contribute to an
'external validation' of Stanford."
