The increased occurrence of security "leaks" within
the Reagan Administration and accused spies coming
to the forefront of the national media's attention has
led to an interesting dilemma for many U.S. media
agencies.
The problem centers around the issue of the
freedom of the press to disclose the information that it
uncovers and the possible resulting damage to
"national security."
In recent weeks, Central Intelligence Agency Direc
tor William Casey has alleged that the nation's news
media is passing on valuable national security informa
tion.
Citing the Washington Post, Washington Times,
New York Times, Time magazine, Newsweek maga
zine and NBC, Casey has even threatened to take legal
action against some members of the media. His pri
mary weapon is Section 798 of Title 18 of the U.S.
Code, which forbids the disclosure of classified infor
mation about secret codes and other communications
intelligence.
Casey's remarks not only seem to lack solid evidence
to support them, but they smack of a dangerous pre
cedent in American journalism: an attempt to control
the nation's media through scare tactics. That is some
thing that should be opposed at all costs.
Many of Casey's arguments are diluted by the fact
that much of the information supposedly "leaked" is
hardly indicative of high-priority national security.
Casey, for instance, asked the Justice Department to
prosecute NBC for a recent report that was identical to
one aired last November and included details about
U.S. submarine operations that had been revealed as
early as the mid-19705.

It has long been a tactic by past administrations, and
the Reagan Administration in particular, to use the na
tion's media as a vehicle to achieve their own political
goals and doctrines. It is highly ironic, then, for this ad
ministration or any other to criticize the press' freedom
to print information as it sees fit.
If the U.S. government is concerned about the in
creased tendency of its trade secrets winding up in the
hands of the Soviets or any other foreign body, it
should make an effort to tighten up its own internal
controls rather than expecting to exercise external con
trols through the media.
It should always be the domain of the press to decide
what is and is not fit to print, and there has not been
any indication that such pillars of American journalism
as the New York Times and Washington Post,
precisely the kinds of media organizations Casey is at
tacking, have acted improperly in choosing when to
and when not to disclose their information. There have
been past instances when such publications have
indeed "killed" stories bcause of their supposed harm
to national security.
There should always be a recourse to take legal ac
tion against the press when it has acted irresponsibly,
but that recourse should be used thoughtfully and
fairly. Casey's threats portend not only a struggle be
tween government and the media, but a possible sub
jugation of the latter to the former.
Freedom of the press is not just an aspect of Ameri
can society. It is vitally important to the free exchange
of ideas and thoughts that this nation is predicated
upon, and it is a right which should be closely protected
for the good of everyone.
