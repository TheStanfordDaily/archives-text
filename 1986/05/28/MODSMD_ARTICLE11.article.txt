## Theme house is valuable 
### 
Ethnic theme houses at Stanford have come under at
tack from many sources in the past. Recently, there ap
peared a viewpoint by Lily Chang (Daily, May 16)
criticizing theme houses, particularly Okada, and recom
mending the elimination of such residences. As an Asian
and a resident of Okada, I am offended by much of
Chang's statement.
It is nothing less than an insult to imply, as Chang does,
that Okada has contributed nothing to Stanford's ethnic
diversity. Chang has never lived in Okada, yet feels justi
fied to pass judgment on the dorm, its residents and its ac
tivities. With all due respect to Chang s opinions, I feel it
is necessary to clarify certain points concerning ethnic
theme houses, especially Okada.

It appears to me that many in the Stanford community
do not fully grasp the purpose and utility of ethnic theme
houses. Theme houses were not designed nor are pres
ently used as safe-houses from discrimination, as Chang
might have us believe. They exist as forums to promote
the sharing and understanding of different, non-American
cultures. They are centers for cross-cultural exchange.
Okada is not a place where Asians come to hide and
insulate themselves from others. In this way, Chang seems
to be reading the sentiments of the Asian community in
correctly — it is not a widespread belief among Asians
that the outside world is overly hostile or that they are
being persecuted and discriminated against here at Stan
ford. Chang is merely creating a problem which does not
exist. She then attempts to blame Okada and other theme
houses for its existence. This invention of a previously
nonexistent controversy is not at all necessary and will be
nothing less than detrimental to Chang's professed cause.
Chang argues that if Asians seek to educate the Stan
ford community about Asian culture and problems, this
can be accomplished much more successfully by individ
uals without any aid from Okada. This is simply not the
case. The equality that Asians at Stanford possess could
never have been achieved without the organizing influ
ence and support of larger groups of Asians, such as those
residing in Okada.
I find it difficult to understand Chang's reasoning when
she states that residence in Okada implies a neglect and
rejection of our responsibilties as Asians. It is through
Okada that we can more effectively fulfill these responsi
bilities. Were it not for ethnic theme houses, events such
as Okada's Extravaganza, Casa Zapata's Cinco De Mayo
celebration and Ujamaa's Club Ujamaa could never have
been organized or staged. Does Chang doubt that these

events help educate the non-minority population at Stan
ford? The point that larger, unified groups such as Okada
will find more success in their endeavors than individuals
is not one that needs to be debated.
Individual Asians cannot match the cultural diversity of
Okada, the Asian theme house. Individuals offer only one
view of Asian life and culture. Okada is home to students
of various Asian backgrounds — it has a larger, more ex
tensive pool of experiences and opinions that may be
drawn upon in an effort to educate the Stanford commu
nity. Without a large groups of Asians living together in a
residence such as Okada, it is very easy for individual
Asians to lose the very Asian identity which Chang hopes
to expose to all Stanford students.
Perhaps we should consider the consequences of elim
inating ethnic theme houses at Stanford. The very equality
of Asians which Chang strives so hard to preserve would
die with the theme houses and their educational pro
grams. Chang proposes that we rid Stanford of such theme
houses, yet feels that minority cultures will still be
represented since "the programming of ethnic groups can
be brought to all students. . .." What does this mean? It
means that, in the absence of ethnic theme houses, it
would be necessary to have different ethnic groups hold
educational programs in each dorm. Not only is this
ludicrously inefficient, but it is tantamount to having
minorities force their ethnicity on others. This is the most
dangerous action any minority group can take, and exactly
what the Asian community at Stanford must avoid.
In conclusion, it should be understood that the exis
tence of theme houses does not promote isolationism in
any form. The residents of Okada are no less involved in
campus matters than students living in other dorms.
Asians in Okada take very seriously their responsibilities
to their own cultures as well as to the Stanford commu
nity. We do not need to be reminded of this and are offen
ded when non-residents of Okada accuse us of inertia and
apathy. In her article, Chang expresses a personal opinion
that Asians can successfully educate non-Asians concern
ing Asian culture on an individual basis. I respect this
opinion, but request that she not reject the efforts Okada
has made to promote the understanding of Asian culture.
If our goal is to help others understand Asian culture,
efforts must be made both by individuals and by unified
groups. If these efforts seem lacking, they are not lacking
on the side of Okada, but on the side of individual Asians,
and for these individuals, such as Chang, to criticize
Okada's efforts is nothing short of obscene. Ethnic theme
houses play an integral role in the educational experience
at Stanford and must be retained,
