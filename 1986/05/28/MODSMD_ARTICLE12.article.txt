Send books, not
military supplies
While President Reagan continues
his drive to win $100 million in mili
tary aid for his so-called "freedom
fighters" in Nicaragua, Stanford stu
dents are working to bring the
Nicaraguan people genuine
humanitarian aid. Instead of guns and
ammunition to support the contras —
a bloody, undemocratic mercenary
army — students from Sanctuary at
Stanford, Stanford Central American
Action Network (SCAAN) and other
groups are collecting textbooks to
send to Nicaraguan schools.
The Nicaragua book drive is taking
place now, and for the next two
weeks you can help. Students will be
coming to your dorm or department
soon to collect any books you wish to
donate. (Do you really need that or
ganic chem book now that you
decided not to be a doctor? The
Bookstore, if they buy it.and they of
ten won't, only pays you 10 percent

anyway.) Many books, even in En
glish, are desperately needed in
Nicaraguan schools and health care
centers. Others will be sold, with the
money going to a Teacher Training
School in the town of Esteli, located
in an area that has been badly
damaged by contra attacks. All you
have to do is keep your eyes open for
the donation boxes, which will be
decorated with blue flyers and lo
cated in most dorms, some depart
ments, Meyer Library and White
Plaza during lunch hour. Please be
generous — any book at all will help
the Nicaraguan people live better
daily lives.

Letter is distortion
1 find it appalling that the contro
versy over the denial of a permanent
position to Prof. Norman Davies
should lead to a public debate, with

rather ugly overtones, on issues ex
traneous to the case.
In the ensuing discussion the issue
of Polish-Jewish relations has some
how been brought to the fore. This, in
turn, has occasioned a letter (Daily,
May 21) which opens by asserting
that "Most Polish citizens did nothing
to oppose the systematic slaughter of
Poland's Jewish population by the
Nazis" and ends by remarking on
"the relationship of the Poles to the
extermination of European Jewry."
It is somewhat surprising that in
trying to assign at least a part of the
blame for the Nazi mass murders to
the Poles, Jon Adelstein choses his
words rather carelessly. Which of the
six major nationalities among "Polish
citizens" of pre-war Poland does
Adelstein have in mind? Is it really an
established "historical fact" that
"Hitler chose to place . . . extermina
tion camps in Poland in part because
of the virulent anti-Semitism . . .
there"? Are we to understand that
the anti-Semitism in Germany was
not virulent enough to support death

camps on German soil? And how rel
evant are Hitler's motives anyway?
In addition to confusing the distinc
tion between fact and speculation,
Adelstein betrays a complete ignor
ance of the realities of the Nazi occu
pation of Poland. The German mili
tary and police apparatus had the
power of life and, quite literally,
death over the terrorized population.
The Poles did no more and no less to
oppose the extermination of the
Polish Jews than they did to oppose
the death of the other 3 million Poles
who perished. They were also incapa
ble of stopping, for instance, the com
plete destruction of Warsaw with
nearly all of its cultural heritage (in
material form). Surely, it is well
known that it took many years of con
certed allied effort and countless
casualties before the German military
machine was crushed.
Perhaps the chair in Eastern
European history has been vacant for
too long, after all.
