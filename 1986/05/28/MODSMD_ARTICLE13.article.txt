## Reflections on America 
### 
Permit me, on the eve of my graduation from law
school, to indulge myself in a short essay that is largely
autobiographical. When I came to this country seven
years ago, America owed me nothing. Now I have a bach
elor's degree from Dartmouth College and I am on the
verge of receiving a law degree from Stanford University.
I'll make no bones aboout it: I am very pro-America.
I came to America from India by way of England where
I completed my last two years of high school. Two
suitcases in hand, 1 arrived at Dartmouth on a Saturday
night, at about 11 p.m. in late August 1979, having taken
a flight from London to Boston. The student housing
offices at Dartmouth were closed so I could not get a key
to my dormitory room at that late hour. Nevertheless, I
had scarcely stepped off the bus from Boston when I

stumbled into Dartmouth's rabbi and his wife while they
were taking a late evening stroll on the quiet streets of
Hanover. I introduced myself as a freshman and explained
that I had just flown in from London; they immediately
invited me to spend the night at their home.
I seriously doubt whether any Englishman would have
done that for me, but anyway I am convinced that kind of
thing is far more likely to happen to me in America than it
is in England. I discovered, in America, a society that was
far more egalitarian than the one I had encountered in
England.
And yet Dartmouth College would scarcely be the place
you would think where anyone could possibly come to the
conclusion that American society is at all egalitarian. For
Dartmouth is known among the Ivy League schools for its
preppie image. It was the last of the Ivies to go co
educational, and it has historically had the lowest
percentage of minority students enrolled among the Ivies
(a fact which the admissions director there explained to
me should be attributed to Dartmouth's cold climate).
At Dartmouth, the biggest issue of controversy when I
arrived was whether the college should revive its Indian
symbol — a controversy with which the Stanford commu
nity is familiar. My own view on the subject was and
remains that the Indian symbol is a bad idea so long as
some people object to it, even if they are a minority. In a
college community, a symbol ought to have unanimous
support — and surely there are symbols that are not of
fensive to anyone at all.
Indeed, if Dartmouth were to have a constitution akin
to that of the federal constitution, the argument can be
made that native Americans (for obviously personal,
among other, reasons I do not call them Indians) would
qualify for the highest level of judicial protection and col

lege endorsed discrimination against them would be un
constitutional.
Anyway, at Dartmouth there were other controversies.
The trustees picked a new college president while I was
there who came from the corporate world. His scholarly
credentials were thin, his writings and speeches proved
anemic and his posturing effete. At Dartmouth, I was a
part-time student and part-time journalist. On my type
writer, I bashed away at the new college president and I
bashed away at the college's rival right-wing tabloid. But
what it all boils down to is pure Americana: I spent four
years at Dartmouth celebrating America, celebrating the
First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
I spent my last quarter at Dartmouth on a language
study program in Lyon, France. From the banks of the
Rhone, I wrote to Dartmouth's president (a letter he in
formed me he subsequently used for fund-raising
purposes) asking him to accept, on behalf of the college,
my most profound thanks for the excellent education I
had received there and for the enormous sums of financial
aid — frankly, I feel perfectly good about calling it welfare
— I received from the school. I expressed my hope that
the college would place top priority on adequately funding
its financial aid programs.
Law school has left me little time for journalism. At law
school, I have, of course, studied American law almost ex
clusively, and the Burger Court notwithstanding, my
respect for this country and its laws has only increased.
Of America's adversarial system of justice, warts and
all, I am a great fan. Indigent individuals in this country
who have had their rights infringed or have suffered per
sonal injuries have access to the courts through the con
tingency fee system. A contingency fee permits an individ
ual to hire a lawyer without paying the lawyer. The lawyer
is paid only if the lawsuit is successful and typically the
lawyer receives one-third of the proceeds.
In England and in India, the contingency fee is banned
for the circular reason that it is a public evil. Conse
quently, the Bhopal victims wanted American justice, and
I don't blame them at all.
Americans arrested for crimes are given Miranda warn
ings. They are told they have a right to remain silent and
they have a right to a lawyer. That is simply wonderful.
Yes, in America, even the guilty have rights. The state is
obliged to follow certain procedures and the most vile of
criminals is entitled to procedural fairness before he can
be lawfully convicted. In too many other countries, indi
viduals accused of crimes have too few rights. It is thus
that when I spent my last semester at law school arguing,
in my criminal procedure course, on the side of the defen
dants, I was, once more, celebrating America.
