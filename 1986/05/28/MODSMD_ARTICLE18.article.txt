## Body-building at its best 
### ANDREA ARNOLD Staff writer 
It started out as another Mechanical Engineering 210
project. But it ended up winning the student design award
at the ninth annual conference of the Association for the
Advancement of Rehabilitation Technology (RESNA)
Ihe project is entitled "Design, Development and
Evaluation of a New Body-Powered Arm Prosthesis."
Three masters students in mechanical engineering, Scott
Delp, Georgene Nielsen and Robert Wood, originally
chose this project to complete their ME2IO class under
the direction of their faculty adviser, Felix Zajac. Doug
Franz, also pursuing his master's degree in mechanical en
gineering here, joined the staff spring quarter to help with
testing.
the new arm prosthesis is designed for below-elbow
amputees, to help them with daily activities in a more
comfortable manner. Franz, himself a below-elbow am
putee, noted that "most prostheses have a shoulder har
ness that is used to run the hand."
"For below-elbow amputees, it was our objective to get
rid of the harness, so they aren't essentially tying up a
good portion of their upper body to run their hand,"
Franz said. "At the beginning of the project, when we
were talking to amputees, that was one of the big prob
lems, that the harness is really uncomfortable and kind of
ugly, and puts a lot of wear and tear on their bodies."
The new prosthesis, called the Tricep Power Capture
arm prosthesis, uses the tricep to power the hand, rather
than using a cable operated by the opposite shoulder. The
team of students thought of many different designs to ful
fill the criteria for the most desirable prosthesis, and they
found that this particular design ranked the highest among
the design alternatives.
1 he sponsor of the project, the Children's Hospital at
Stanford, sees the potential of the new design. "They
originally gave us $2,000, but that was pretty loose,"

Wood said. "We had something good going, and we
needed some more money. They were flexible to allot it to
us."
Money isn't all they put into it, however. A lot of time
and hard work also went into the project. "We've taken it
completely from the initial problem statement all the way
through conceptualizing the idea, to the initial design,
detail drawings, prototype fabrications, and now we're
going to do the testing," Nielsen said.
But she also sees it as valuable experience. "We're
taking the project from beginning to end. I've never taken
a project the full way at school," she said.
Apart from winning the RESNA design competition,
their hard work has paid off in other ways. "I think it's
going to work. The real encouraging thing is we've been
spending a lot of time in the prosthetics shop at the
Children's Hospital, so a lot of people are coming up, ask
ing, 'What is it? How does it work?' And these are guys
that build braces or orthotics or prosthetics all day, so they
have a lot of experience. And when they say, 'That's a
good idea, I think it will work,' that's really encouraging,"
Delp said.
However, they are trying not to be too optimistic.
Wood notes that with a prosthesis, "it's really hard to tell
whether a motion is natural or easily learned. So we're
trying not to draw any conclusions before we do tests and
get data." In any case, he said, "We're all pretty excited
about it, but we're anxious to get into testing now, and to
get some good data, to see how it really works. Then
maybe we'll go from being excited about it to being, hope
fully, exhilarated about it."
After testing and fine-tuning, the students will present
the design here at Stanford on June 5. After that, they will
go to Minneapolis to present the finished project at the
RESNA conference. And then, "We'll give it to the
Children's Hospital. Our sponsors can decide whether it's
worthwhile to continue pursuing it," Wood said.
