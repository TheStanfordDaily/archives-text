## New microprocessor is fastest 
### 
Engineers at Stanford's Center for
Integrated Systems (CIS) have de
signed a microprocessor capable of
hitting speeds of 20 million instruc
tions a second and running in parallel
with others like it.
The chip, called the MIPS-X,
makes use of a new design of com
puter, the Reduced Instruction Set
Computer, or RISC machine, as well
as a popular integrated circuit tech
nology known as Complementary
Metal Oxide Semiconductor
(CMOS).
The design so far exists only in a
computer database, but according to
Mark Horowitz, assistant professor of
electrical engineering and the team
leader, a chip will be fabricated by the
summer.
The chip will be 8 millimeters by
8.5 millimeters (three-tenths of an
inch by thirty-four-hundreths of an
inch) and will contain 150,000 tran
sistors.
"In fairness, the 20 million instruc
tions is really the peak, the best it
would ever do," Horowitz says. "We
hope to have an effective throughput
of 10 million to 12 million instruc
tions per second."
If a computer was built with 10 of
those chips operating in parallel, it
could perform 100 million instruc
tions, making it one of the fastest
-omputers in the world.

Horowitz's project is the lineal de
scendant of a computer called the
MIPS, designed at Stanford by John
Hennessey. The MIPS was one of the
first of the RISC machines.
RISC machines currently are the
"designer jeans" of the computer in
dustry. something of a fad, Horowitz
explains, with many companies now
producing them, and some, such as
Hewlett-Packard, taking great risks
on RISC technology.
Essentially, a RISC computer takes
the most commonly performed in

structions and tries to implement
them so they can run as fast as possi
ble, even if it means sacrificing the
speed of less common instructions.
Since computers mostly do very
simple things, the processor runs very
quickly.
"The project was really an experi
ment in many different areas,"
Horowitz says. "One was some issues
in software design, or in combinations
of hardware-software: How do you
build very high performance
machines, what do you need to put in

hardware, what do you need to put in
software?
"The project has been accom
plished with about 13 other people,
most of them students, and two
postdocs," Horowitz says. "People
were about evenly divided between
designers working on the hardware
and software designers.
"Part of the basic premise of both
the original MIPS work and the
MIPS-X is that a lot of the complexity
that's normally placed in the hard
ware of the processor can actually be
migrated (moved) to the software.
It's oftentimes easier to deal with it in
terms of software than hardware, and
since hardware design takes longer
and has longer turn-around times,"
he says.
Software isn't necessarily slower
than hardware, Horowitz says.
The MIPS-X project was "also an
experiment in just design: What does
it take to design a large machine?"
"I never really designed a large mi
croprocessor. I was interested in
seeing what it really involves, just in
terms of silicon design techniques so I
could have a better feel for what tools
are available and what problems
really are hard problems of design."
The microprocessor makes use of
CMOS, "commonly held as the cur
rent generation technology, one that
everyone should use."
