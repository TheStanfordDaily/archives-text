# Students seek alternate fund
## Prank mars senate meeting 
### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
The establishment of a tax-exempt
trust fund for donations that will be
withheld from the University until it
divests constituted the final act of the
16th ASSU Senate at its last meeting
of the year last night.
Earlier in the evening, Stanford
police were called in to break up a
fight which broke out when four
members of the Chaparral entered
the meeting and threw whipped
cream at the senators.
The "Free South Africa Fund" is
intended to aid University donors
who "are put off by Stanford's policy
on and investments in apartheid
South Africa." according to the bill
authored by Graduate Senator Jim
DeLaHunt and Undergraduate
Senator Dave Smolen.
The fund will "receive and hold
donations to Stanford until Stanford
ceases its investment in apartheid
South Africa." These funds will be
placed in "a non-profit, tax-exempt
trust," under the direction of a board
of trustees.
According to the bill, the trustees
of the Free South Africa Fund are
graduate student William Handley,
and seniors Michael McFaul, Susan
Rice and Laurie Edelstein. The stu
dents declined to comment on the
success of the bill, saying details will
be explained at a press conference
Thursday.
The trust will be placed in the
ASSU's Student Organizations Fund
and invested in South-Africa free
funds, receiving "the same rate of in
terest the ASSU receives on deposits

of South Africa-free expendable
funds," No withdrawals from the ac
count will be permitted.
The fund will exist until "Stanford
totally divests from all companies
doing business in South Africa or
when majority rule is established in
South Africa, or if neither happens
after a number of years, to donate the
funds to a suitable charity to benefit
black South Africans."
According to senators in favor of
the bill, the trustees plan to lead a
drive for donations during Com
mencement, in the hopes that their
efforts will receive coverage in The
Stanford Observer.
Earlier in the meeting, a closed ses
sion concerning the Nominations
Commission's spring report was in
terrupted when a group of four stu
dents wearing bicycle helmets and
goggles burst into the Law School
room and threw pie tins full of
whipped cream at the senators.
Sophomores Jim Suhre and Josh
Weinstein, senior Ron Herbst and
freshman Joe Dew were involved in
the incident, which they said was
"done in the tradition of fun,"
Senators" reactions ranged from
laughter to violence as Graduate
Senator Eric Berg hit Suhre on the
head with a thermos, and Senate
Chair Carey White chased Weinstein
into the lobby of the building, throw
ing him to the floor and punching him
in the stomach.
In the confusion, the police were
called, and the four students turned
themselves in. Weinstein said the
police will not pursue the case, "since
they're treating it like a prank."
"It won't happen again,"
Weinstein said. "I can see how Carey
(White) is upset, since he put so much
work into the senate, and I am going
to write a letter of apology."
White said he plans to "sit down
and talk to" the students involved, to
make them "understand it would
have been a good joke at any place
but the Law School, and at any time
but the last meeting this senate had
together.
