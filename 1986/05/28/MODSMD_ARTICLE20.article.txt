# Lucy's finder to speak here

### DAVID LIPPEATT Editorial staff 
Have you ever wondered where
your great-grandparents came
from, or what they were like? How
about your great-great
grandparents? How about your
ancestors from way, way back —
say a few million years?
World-famous paleoanthropol
ogist, director of Berkeley's In
stitute of Human Origins, and
Stanford professor Donald Johan
son, discoverer of "Lucy," the an
cient, near-complete skeleton of a
small human ancestor, will be
delivering the Biology Depart
ment's Fourth Annual David Starr
Jordan Memorial Lecture on
Thursday, May 29, from 4 to 5
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
Entitled "The Human Fossil
Record in Africa: Controversy
and Consensus," Johanson's talk
will focus on the current status of
knowledge about the human fam
ily tree, and will give his point of

view on the lively debate that his
theories have sparked.
Johanson is best known for his
remarkable discoveries of hominid
(human-like) fossil remains in
Ethiopia's Afar triangle. In 1974,
he unearthed "Lucy," the skeleton
of an anthropoid which walked the
plains of Africa over three-and-a
half-million years ago and which
Johanson claims is the oldest in
tact skeleton of any bipedal
(upright-walking) human ancestor
ever found.
Johanson's theories about
human origins and how Lucy Fits
into them have rocked the world
of paleoanthropology and chal
lenged long-held views on human
evolution — especially those of
Richard Leakey, son of famed
anthropologist Louis Leakey. The
difference in opinion between
Johanson and the younger Leakey
has formed the basis of the current
controversy.
The talk will be free and open to
the public. A reception will follow.
