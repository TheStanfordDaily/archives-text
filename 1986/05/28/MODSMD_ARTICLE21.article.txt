## Stanford golfers tee it up in NCAAs Wagner, Walsworth key Card resurgence 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The NCAA championships in Winston-
Salem, N.C., will culminate four years of growth
for Carl Wagner, Don Walsworth and the Stan
ford men's golf team.
Wagner and Walsworth were Stanford Coach
Tim Schaaf s first two recruits, and both, as well
as the team, have reached levels of national
prominence that wouldn't necessarily have been
predicted four years ago.
"They both came in at a time when the pro
gram was in a state of transition," Schaaf said,
"and they've matured very much with the pro
gram."
Before Wagner and Walsworth came to Stan
ford, the Cardinal had been to nationals only
once in the previous four years and won no
tournaments in that period. Since then, Stan
ford has posted eight tournament wins and
three NCAA appearances.
However, while each contributed immedi
ately to the team, neither made the dramatic
impact of, say, a Dwight Gooden.
"They were both talented juniors (high
schoolers)," Schaaf said, "but neither one of
them was a can't-miss college player."
"I played in all the tournaments (freshman
year) until the spring," Walsworth said, "but I
never really played all that well. By the time
spring came I had made many changes in my
swing."
"I had a very good freshman year," Wagner
said of the season in which he finished fifth in
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships. "My
sophomore year was fairly uneventful."
"By springtime (of sophomore year),"
Walsworth said, "I made the biggest improve
ment he'd (Schaaf) seen until Roger (Miraglia)
this year and played in the nationals. I never
really won anything but was gradually improv
ing ... my whole career is gradual improve
ment."
As juniors, their accomplishments became
more and more noteworthy. Wagner won the
Wolfpack tournament in Reno and finished
ninth in his first NCAA tournament appear
ance. Walsworth finished third in the U.S. In
tercollegiate at Stanford then won the Missouri
State Amateur that summer.
Walsworth and Wagner each played a role in
the other s improvement.

"We came in at the same time when (the pro
gram) wasn't really that good," Walsworth said.
"We've always played at the same level; we're
good friends but we're also competitors."
"Everything the team's gone through and in
school (both are economics majors) we've
pretty much gone through together," Wagner
said. "It's been a great help.
"Besides the fact we push ourselves in our
play, we help each other out," Wagner contin
ued. "We both had some down times, (but) the
other one's been there to give the right kind of
advice at the right time so the downs don't last
too long."
This year, Wagner started off stronger than
Walsworth, but Walsworth stole the headlines
near the end of the season by winning the Pac
10s earlier this month. Both, however, appear
primed for the NCAAs.
"Both of them had very strong senior years,"
Schaaf said. "Carl has played a little more
steadily this year than Don, but Don capped the
season with Pac-10s."
"Right before we came back, I decided to
make another swing change," Walsworth said.
"After that I pretty much got into a big slump,
caught up in mediocrity.
"Pac-10s were definitely the highlight of my
career," he added. "After winning Pac-10s, es
pecially beating Sam Randolph (USC's 1985
U.S. Amateur Champion) on that course, I feel
I can beat anyone now."
"I'd like to go out playing well at NCAAs,"
Wagner said. "I think after four years of experi
ence Don and I both should do quite well."
But regardless of how the pair does this week,
their effect on Stanford golf will not be forgot
ten.
"If you look at how they've both come along,
it's very gratifying," Schaaf said. "They have
had to work as hard or harder than anyone else
and they've done that.
"They are very strong candidates for Aca
demic All-America," Schaaf added. "They rep
resent the type of person that succeeds for both
of us — that excels in both departments. They
also, I think, have exemplified the spirit of the
team — place team goals high."
"It's been nice for Carl and I to know we
played a big part in turning the program
around," Walsworth said. "I hope the guys can
keep it going."
