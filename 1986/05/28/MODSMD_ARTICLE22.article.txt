# Powerful field awaits Cardinal men in N.C.

### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Last year, the Stanford men's golf team came
into the NCAA championships ranked 17th in
the nation, but took the lead after the first
round on its way to finishing ninth.
Today, Stanford tees off at this years NCAA
tournament in Winston-Salem, N.C., in a similar
situation. The Cardinal is once again about in
the middle of the 33-team pack, but it still
retains hopes of duplicating or even improving
upon last year's top-10 finish.
"I think we're capable of finishing in the top
-10," Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said. "It's
going to take a little better golf than we have
been doing, (but) we seem to have been playing
a little better in practice."

The members of the team had a playoff last
week for the right to go to the nationals at Wake
Forest. Making the trip are Don Walsworth,
Carl Wagner, Brad Geer, Roger Miraglia and
Phil Rowley.
It is a unique squad, made up of three seniors
(Walsworth, Wagner and Rowley) and two
freshmen (Geer and Miraglia). Only Walsworth
and Wagner have played on the varsity for all of
1985-86. Rowley did not play from November
to February, Miraglia made his first start in Jan
uary and Geer has not started since March.
"If we can get two good rounds out of
(Rowley, Geer and Miraglia), then we could do
well." Wagner said.
