# United States knocked out of qualifying rounds by Costa Rica
## Mexico to host 1986 soccer World Cup 
### FLAVIO FEFERMAN Editorial staff 
The world's greatest sporting event
i.> just three days away. On Saturday,
defending champion Italy will meet
Bulgaria in the opening match of the
soccer World Cup at the Azteca
Stadium in Mexico City.
The event is aptly named as 119
countries participated in the elimina
tion rounds which started nearly two
years ago. Twenty-two teams
qualified for the finals and were
joined by defending champion Italy
and host country Mexico, which
earned automatic berths.
The field was divided into six
groups which will play in nine differ
ent Mexican cities The first and
second-place Finishers in each group,
along with the four best third-place
teams, will advance to the single elimi
nation phase of the competition
which starts on June 15.
This is a change from the 1982
World Cup in Spain when new groups
were formed after the First round and
third-place teams did not qualify. An
estimated two billion people world
wide will watch the finals on June 29.
also to be played at the Azteca
Stadium.
The World Cup was first organized
in 1930 by the Federation Inter

nationale de Football Association
(FIFA), soccer's international
governing body. Uruguay, the Olym
pic champion at the time, was chosen
to host the event. Since then the
World Cup has alternated between
European and American countries
eveiy four years. There was an hiatus
between 1938 and 1950 due to the
war.

The winner keeps the cup until the
next running of the event. Three
championships seal the trophy for
good. The first World Cup was
named after Jules Rimet, FIFA's
president at the time of the inception
of the event. In 1970, Pele's
Brazil trounced Italy 4-1 in a battle
of two-time champions to keep the
Rimet Trophy in Brazil forever. That
final was also held in the Azteca
Stadium.
In fact, Mexico is the first country
to host the World Cup for the second
time. Colombia was originally sched

uled to host the event, but it had to
hack out due to financial difficulties.
Brazil, the host in 1950, and the
United States also showed interest in
replacing Colombia, but Mexico got
the nod.
Ironically, Mexico's economic sit
uation seams to be almost as
precarious as Colombia's, but the
Mexicans have put earthquakes and
foreign debts aside, and are con
centrating their efforts on the World
Cup. They huve improved their
stadiums and are bulking up security
to prevent the type of violence that
stunned the world last year in a game
between Juventus of Italy and Liver
pool.
With all the best teams from the
1982 World Cup in Spain returning,
and a couple of new contenders at
their heels, the tournament shows
much promise. There also seems to
be more parity in the field this year.
Dark horse Italy beat West Germany
in the finals of the 1982 World Cup,
but Brazil, France and West Ger
many were heavily favored.
These three teams are still strong
contenders for the title this year.
However. France, the European
champion in 1984. seems to be the
only one of the three that has im
proved or at least maintained itself at
the same level as 1982.

Brazil and Germany have been
plagued by injuries and aging legs.
Italy still has basically the same team
that won the championship in 1982
and is eyeing a repeat win; there
aren't as many skeptics this time
around. Argentina and Spain im
proved their teams and could con
tend, while the Spanish squad could
make good on the debt it owes its
country after losing at home in 1982.
Denmark and Hungaiy may be the
big surprises, and England and
Poland have good teams as usual.
Belgium will be out to prove it
deserves all the attention it received
prior to the 1982 Cup. Paraguay and
Uruguay, the rest of the South Amer
ican contingency, are also good
teams. Uruguay is especially good,
but it was slotted into "El Grupo de
La Morte" — The Group of Death —
along with West Germany, Denmark
and Scotland. This is undoubtedly the
toughest group of all.
And then there is Mexico. Mexico
was never a real power, but the team
has been training hard and has the big
advantage of playing at home. In the
12 World Cups that have been
played, the home team has won Five
times. i
Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, North-

em Ireland, Scotland and Portugal
also qualified from Europe. South
Korea was a surprise qualifier from
the Asian bracket along with Iraq.
Algeria and Morocco will represent
Africa, and Canada was the qualifier
from North America.
Where is the United States? It lost
to Costa Rica and once again failed to
qualify. The United States still takes
credit, though, for one of the biggest
upsets in World Cup history when it
beat England 1-0 in 1950.
With no active outdoor soccer
league, the United States seems to be
fated to keep slipping out of the
World Cup for years to come, or at
least until it can host the event and
gain an automatic berth.
Mexico won't be the only team to
benefit from the World Cup's loca
tion. The environment tends to play
an important role. South American
teams are more dominant when the
Cup is held this side of the Atlantic.
Likewise, European teams fare
better on their own continent. Brazil
has been the only South American

team to win in Europe — in 1958
when a 17-year old Pele led the team
to a 5-2 victory against the home
team, Sweden. No European team
was ever victorious on American soil.
The heat of the early Mexican sum-

mer should help teams like Brazil,
Argentina and Uruguay, which are
more used to playing under those
conditions. Most of the games will be
played at noon under intense heat,
and almost always at high altitudes
which will require extra stamina and
endurance from the players.

Many countries chose to train at
high altitudes to adjust their players'
pulmonary capacity to the conditions.
Latin teams should also be helped
by the partisan Mexican crowds,
which appreciate their creative style
of play as opposed to the more physi
cal kick-and-run soccer practiced by
many European teams, most notably
West Germany and England.
The Mexicans are especially fond
of Brazil, which left a lasting impres
sion there en route to its victory in the
1970 World Cup. Argentina will also
be a crowd favorite along with France
which plays a very creative Latin -
style game.
The United States will enjoy
unprecedented World Cup television
coverage. NBC will cover seven con
tests including the opener between
Italy and Bulgaria and this Sunday's
game between Brazil and Algeria. It
will also televise the final game.
ESPN plans to show 15 games. The
Spanish network (SIN), channel 14
locally, will broadcast every game
tape-delaying those that occur simul
taneously.
Tomorrow The Daily analyzes the
individual teams, their stars and their
chances.

These three teams are still strong
contenders for the title this year.
However. France, the European
champion in 1984. seems to be the
only one of the three that has im
proved or at least maintained itself at
the same level as 1982.

Brazil and Germany have been
plagued by injuries and aging legs.
Italy still has basically the same team
that won the championship in 1982
and is eyeing a repeat win; there
aren't as many skeptics this time
around. Argentina and Spain im
proved their teams and could con
tend, while the Spanish squad could
make good on the debt it owes its
country after losing at home in 1982.
Denmark and Hungaiy may be the
big surprises, and England and
Poland have good teams as usual.
Belgium will be out to prove it
deserves all the attention it received
prior to the 1982 Cup. Paraguay and
Uruguay, the rest of the South Amer
ican contingency, are also good
teams. Uruguay is especially good,
but it was slotted into "El Grupo de
La Morte" — The Group of Death —
along with West Germany, Denmark
and Scotland. This is undoubtedly the
toughest group of all.
And then there is Mexico. Mexico
was never a real power, but the team
has been training hard and has the big
advantage of playing at home. In the
12 World Cups that have been
played, the home team has won Five
times. i
Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, North-

em Ireland, Scotland and Portugal
also qualified from Europe. South
Korea was a surprise qualifier from
the Asian bracket along with Iraq.
Algeria and Morocco will represent
Africa, and Canada was the qualifier
from North America.
Where is the United States? It lost
to Costa Rica and once again failed to
qualify. The United States still takes
credit, though, for one of the biggest
upsets in World Cup history when it
beat England 1-0 in 1950.
With no active outdoor soccer
league, the United States seems to be
fated to keep slipping out of the
World Cup for years to come, or at
least until it can host the event and
gain an automatic berth.
Mexico won't be the only team to
benefit from the World Cup's loca
tion. The environment tends to play
an important role. South American
teams are more dominant when the
Cup is held this side of the Atlantic.
Likewise, European teams fare
better on their own continent. Brazil
has been the only South American

team to win in Europe — in 1958
when a 17-year old Pele led the team
to a 5-2 victory against the home
team, Sweden. No European team
was ever victorious on American soil.
The heat of the early Mexican sum-

mer should help teams like Brazil,
Argentina and Uruguay, which are
more used to playing under those
conditions. Most of the games will be
played at noon under intense heat,
and almost always at high altitudes
which will require extra stamina and
endurance from the players.

Many countries chose to train at
high altitudes to adjust their players'
pulmonary capacity to the conditions.
Latin teams should also be helped
by the partisan Mexican crowds,
which appreciate their creative style
of play as opposed to the more physi
cal kick-and-run soccer practiced by
many European teams, most notably
West Germany and England.
The Mexicans are especially fond
of Brazil, which left a lasting impres
sion there en route to its victory in the
1970 World Cup. Argentina will also
be a crowd favorite along with France
which plays a very creative Latin -
style game.
The United States will enjoy
unprecedented World Cup television
coverage. NBC will cover seven con
tests including the opener between
Italy and Bulgaria and this Sunday's
game between Brazil and Algeria. It
will also televise the final game.
ESPN plans to show 15 games. The
Spanish network (SIN), channel 14
locally, will broadcast every game
tape-delaying those that occur simul
taneously.
Tomorrow The Daily analyzes the
individual teams, their stars and their
chances.


1986 World Cup mascot
The world's greatest sporting event
i.> just three days away. On Saturday,
defending champion Italy will meet
Bulgaria in the opening match of the
soccer World Cup at the Azteca
Stadium in Mexico City.
The event is aptly named as 119
countries participated in the elimina
tion rounds which started nearly two
years ago. Twenty-two teams
qualified for the finals and were
joined by defending champion Italy
and host country Mexico, which
earned automatic berths.
The field was divided into six
groups which will play in nine differ
ent Mexican cities The first and
second-place Finishers in each group,
along with the four best third-place
teams, will advance to the single elimi
nation phase of the competition
which starts on June 15.
This is a change from the 1982
World Cup in Spain when new groups
were formed after the First round and
third-place teams did not qualify. An
estimated two billion people world
wide will watch the finals on June 29.
also to be played at the Azteca
Stadium.
The World Cup was first organized
in 1930 by the Federation Inter

nationale de Football Association
(FIFA), soccer's international
governing body. Uruguay, the Olym
pic champion at the time, was chosen
to host the event. Since then the
World Cup has alternated between
European and American countries
eveiy four years. There was an hiatus
between 1938 and 1950 due to the
war.

The winner keeps the cup until the
next running of the event. Three
championships seal the trophy for
good. The first World Cup was
named after Jules Rimet, FIFA's
president at the time of the inception
of the event. In 1970, Pele's
Brazil trounced Italy 4-1 in a battle
of two-time champions to keep the
Rimet Trophy in Brazil forever. That
final was also held in the Azteca
Stadium.
In fact, Mexico is the first country
to host the World Cup for the second
time. Colombia was originally sched

uled to host the event, but it had to
hack out due to financial difficulties.
Brazil, the host in 1950, and the
United States also showed interest in
replacing Colombia, but Mexico got
the nod.
Ironically, Mexico's economic sit
uation seams to be almost as
precarious as Colombia's, but the
Mexicans have put earthquakes and
foreign debts aside, and are con
centrating their efforts on the World
Cup. They huve improved their
stadiums and are bulking up security
to prevent the type of violence that
stunned the world last year in a game
between Juventus of Italy and Liver
pool.
With all the best teams from the
1982 World Cup in Spain returning,
and a couple of new contenders at
their heels, the tournament shows
much promise. There also seems to
be more parity in the field this year.
