# Women boast strong lineup

### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
A strong fall season has
taken the Stanford women's
golf team as far as the NCAA
championships in Columbus,
Ohio. But, beginning today, the
Cardinal is going to have to
prove that it is the same team
as that fall squad.
Stanford is seeded fourth in
the four-day, 72-hole tourna
ment hosted by Ohio State
despite a mediocre spring. The
Cardinal opened 1986 ranked
third in the nation and first in
the far-West region but never
finished higher than fourth in
any tournament, including a
fifth (and last) place finish in
the Pacific West Conference
Championships.
To get to Columbus, the
Cardinal rode the crest of its
powerful fall wave. Rankings in
NCAA women's golf are deter
mined purely statistically— the
teams' average score for the
year is calculated with respect
to the ratings of the courses it
plays. In the fall, Stanford built
up that wave by winning one
tournament and never finishing
lower than fourth.
"We just had a terrific fall
season, and have played very
average this spring," Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin said. "A
little over 60 percent of this
was built on our fall perfor
mance.
"However, I've seen some
very positive indications of re
turning to the way we played in
the fall," he added. "For us to
do really well ... all five are
going to have to play up to their
potential."
Teeing off on the par-73,
6,200-yard Scarlet golf course
("one of the top golf courses in
the country — a real chal
lenge," Baldwin said) for Stan
ford will be Julie Carmichael,
Kay Cornelius, Kathy Kostas,
Kathleen McCarthy and
Adrienne Gilmartin.
Going into the tournament,
Carmichael, who won the
NCAA long-distance driving
contest Monday with a shot of
290 yards, had the 29th-lowest
scoring average in the nation.
Cornelius was ranked 54th,
Kostas 58th and McCarthy
63rd (in contrast to her No. 3
ranking as a freshman). Gil
martin, who did not enter the
starting lineup until the spring,
is ranked 296 th.
One of the causes for the
Cardinal's 1986 decline could
be attributed to the loss of
