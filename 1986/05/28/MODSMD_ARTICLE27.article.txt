# Ultimate Frisbee places second in national meet
## 
### 
After losing 18-16 to the Univer
sity of Massachusetts at Amherst in
the first game of the National Col
legiate Ultimate Frisbee Cham
pionships, Stanford was unable to
take the rematch with its nemesis in
the title game and fell 21-18.
The Cardinal had advanced to
the championship game in St.
Louis' Forest Park by finishing
second in its six-team pool and then
defeating UC-Santa Barbara 19-15
in the semifinals.
Stanford had a long road back
into contention in the 12-team field
after dropping its opening bout.
"If we wanted to win the tourna
ment, we couldn't lose after that,"
Stanford's Peter Lyon said.
The Cardinal bounced back with
a 17-10 victory over Princeton and
then topped MIT to end the first
day of play on Saturday with a 2-1

record. Sunday, Stanford fought
back from a 9-7 halftime deficit to
drop Texas 17-15.
The Cardinal then met South
west Missouri State, which also had
a 3-1 record, in a tussle for a spot in
the final four alongside U-Mass.
"They were somewhat the local
team. They came out pumped up,"
Lyon said of a Southwest Missouri
State team that jumped out to early
4-0 and 7-3 leads. The Cardinal
fought back, though, for a 17-11
win. "It was a real turn-around,"
Lyon said of a game played in a
raging Midwestern rainstorm.
The victory put Stanford into the
semis, where it met UCSB in a
game to 19 points as opposed to
pool contests to 17 and the final to
21.
"We came out really strongly
against Santa Barbara," Lyon said.

"That was possibly our best game."
That Memorial Day win set up
the rematch with U-Mass later that
day, but Stanford may have ex
pended its best effort a little too
early.
"We came out really flat," Lyon
said. "U-Mass led 11-6 at the half.
In ultimate Frisbee, being down
five goals is embarrassing."
The Cardinal fought back in a
second period that Lyon called "a
brilliant defensive effort by both
teams â€” probably the best half of
college ultimate I've ever seen."
It was too little too late, though,
as U-Mass prevailed and took the
crown.
Stanford received a balanced ef
fort, and Lyon noted the play of
Spencer Haywoood, Sandy
Koonce, Peter Hecht, Wes Monroe
and Jim Nicholson, among others.
