# Co-op gets new refugee
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
Columbae last night took on a second Salvadoran
refugee for a period of three days, according to resident
Caroline Paul.
Paul, a senior, would only refer to the 16-year-old
refugee by the initial "W," because of his age and the
"precarious position" which he is now in. She said the new
refugee took part in two presentations given at Columbae
last week on human rights violations in El Salvador.
The decision to house W was reached on May 7 by a
unanimous vote of Columbae residents, according to
senior Susan Sandler, another house resident.
Herman, the Salvadoran refugee who has had sanctuary
in several campus residences since he arrived here April
10. returned to the house last night and will remain there
until the end of the quarter, according to Columbae resi
dent Mike Tarpey, a junior.
Herman began his slay at the beginning of spring quar
ter when Columbae declared itself a sancturary for
Central American refugees. Since then, the entire Stan
ford campus was declared a sanctuary by students voting
in the spring elections.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said last night he
would be "surprised" if Columbae houses Herman for the

remainder of the quarter in defiance of the University's
three-day limit on the time a residence may house a guest.
"1 think the experience to date has been educational.
Folks learned a little about the plight of refugees, but on
the down side a house puts itself in the peril of losing its
own housing privileges if it breaks the University policy.
Lyons said.
"I was in a meeting where we reviewed this policy, and
Herman and others understood this and complied.'' Lyons
said.
However. Paul said that Columbae made its intentions
of housing Herman known from the beginning.
"In our original house statement, we said we would
house Herman indefinitely, and he is free to come and go
as he pleases," Paul said.
She added that the University has never talked to
Columbae directly about its views on the sanctuary move
ment, and labeled the University's reaction a "silent
spring.'"
"People have been very supportive of our effort in and
outside of the house." Tarpey said. Herman has spoken to
about 15 dorms and houses on the Central American
issue.
" The main positive point is the amount of education
Herman has given University students. People now know
more about El Salvador, refugees and U.S. policy in
Central America," Tarpey added.
Herman will appear in court June 2 seeking political
asylum in the United States.
"If Herman gets asylum, he will stay in the country until
the situation (in El Salvador) gets better. If not, I don't

know what he'll do," Tarpey said.
Herman will have to find refuge elsewhere for the sum
mer since Columbae will be closed. •
In the meantime, Herman has been spending time in'
San Francisco consulting his lawyers on the upcoming
trial. He is also continuing to learn English and "adapting
well" to life in the United States, according to Tarpey.
Next fall's Columbae residents will decide whether to
continue the sanctuary movement into the following aca
demic year, Paul said.
"I think the idea will continue to catch fire and grow as
it has," she said.
