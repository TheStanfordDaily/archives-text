Reagan holds talks with Azcona
WASHINGTON — U.S. allies in Central America are putting new
emphasis'on the need for democracy in Nicaragua during Contadora
regional peace talks, President Jose Azcona of Honduras told President
Reagan yesterday, according to an Administration official.
Briefing reporters on bilateral talks during Azcona's working visit, the
official said that Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica
likely would press for "benchmarks" measuring Nicaragua's progress to
be included in the final treaty.
Talks have been stalled on several issues: a timetable for implementa
tion, arftis levels and enforcement mechanisms. The benchmarks have
not been a major issue up to now and it is not yet clear how significant
they will become, although the terms of the proposed treaty already re
quire democratic procedures in Nicaragua.
Azcona met for 45 minutes with Reagan at the White House before a
working lunch. The two later issued a joint communique reaffirming last
year's U.S. pledge to defend Honduras "against communist aggression"
in the region.
U.S. economic aid totaling $61.25 million for fiscal 1986 will be
released immediately, the communique said, indicating U.S. acceptance
of Honduras' new economic plan. Honduras also is receiving $121 mil
lion in military aid, and benefits from the presence of virtually non-stop
U.S. military maneuvers on its soil. Honduras has said more aid is
needed, but U.S. officials have said it is not likely, given current budget
restrictions.
Nonetheless, the Honduran leader described the U.S. security guaran
tees to his country as generally satisfactory.
Nakasone moves towards re-election
TOKYO — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone won Cabinet ap
proval yesterday to call a special session of Parliament, improving his
chances of remaining in office beyond the maximum of four years per
mitted by his Liberal Democratic Party.
The Cabinet decision puts Japan on the path toward general elections
and formalizes Nakasone's triumph against rival leaders within his ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, who have tried for months to torpedo the
popular prime minister's plans to hold elections for both upper and
lower houses of Parliament on the same day.
The special June 2 session is required to dissolve the lower house and
set its election date for the same day as that of the upper house. Reports
in the Japanese media have pinpointed July 6 as the most likely date for
what is referred to here as a "daburu" (double) election.
Normally, the two chambers have different election schedules. But the
Liberal Democrats scored their best results in recent years in 1980,
when both lower and upper house seats were contested on the same day.
The leader of the party that wins the most seats is automatically prime
minister, but current party rules do not permit Nakasone a third term as
leader. He is hoping if he leads the party to a clear victory in the double
election, the party will be moved to change the rule.
Thai leader dismisses general
BANGKOK, Thailand — Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda yester
day dismissed military strongman Gen. Arthit Kamlang-ek from his
politically powerful post as commander-in-chief of the army.
The dismissal order was reportedly sparked by rumors that Arthit was
planning to kidnap Prem and seize power before general elections
scheduled for July 27.
Arthit was replaced by Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyut, a 54-year-old
West Point graduate who has risen rapidly in the military hierarchy
during Prem's six years as prime minister.
Arthit's dismissal, announced over Thailand radio, was signed by King
Bhumibol Adulyadej and co-signed by the prime minister. It is not cus
tomary for military dismissals to require royal signature.
The announcement was broadcast when Arthit was in Nakhorn Sri
Thammarat, south of Bangkok, where the general is known to have the
support of local commanders.
Arthit flew to Bangkok yesterday afternoon where he told reporters at
Don Muang airport: "I respect this royal command because my family
and I have always respected the royal family."
Monday night Prem mysteriously departed for Nakhon Ratchasima
province, northeast of Bangkok, despite several important meetings
scheduled for yesterday in Bangkok.
Another rumor was that Prem and his military supporters decided to
boot Arthit out of his powerful post of commander-in-chief to ensure
that there would be no opposition to Prem during and after the elections.
U.S. defends veto of compromise
BERN, Switzerland — Six weeks of talks on improving East-West
contacts ended yesterday with the United States defending its veto of a
compromise final document.
Other Western delegates sought to minimize the split the U.S. action
has opened in the Atlantic Alliance.
The proposed compromise, drafted by neutral and non-aligned
countries in the hope of breaking a deadlock, dealt with reunifying
divided families and with improving conditions for other personal con
tacts. The Soviet Union, the other Eastern-bloc countries and all the At
lantic Alliance countries with the exception of the United States had in
dicated a willingness to approve it.
Monday, Michael Novak, the chief U.S. delegate, rejected it. He told
the final plenary meeting of the 35 countries represented here that the
proposed final document contained loopholes and was potentially dan
gerous.
"My government takes words seriously," Novak said yesterday, and
added that "there is unease in our country about the growing gap be
tween words and compliance." He said that if the document had been
accepted people could have been hurt, because it contained language
that could be distorted by cynical governments.
Of the delegates here from other countries of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, none supported the American veto but all ex
pressed at least a measure of understanding.
Berlin issue riles NATO diplomats
BONN, West Germany — The Western allies yesterday refused to
comply with East German demands that foreign diplomats display pass
ports at crossing points between East arid West Berlin in a sharp rebuff
to an apparent ploy by the communist state to gain de facto recognition
of East Berlin as its capital.
The East German government, with the apparent consent of the So
viet Union, announced last week that all diplomatic personnel would
have to present passports when crossing from the .Soviet-controled sec
tor to the Western parts of the city.
The surprise decision evoked anger and dismay among representatives
of the United States, Britain and France, which along with the Soviet
Union retain ultimate control over the city under post-war occupation
laws.
The Western allies contend that showing passports would undercut
their rights and symbolically endorse East German claims that the Berlin
Wall represents an international frontier.
The Western allies are extremely reluctant to accept even seemingly
minor unilateral changes in tradition and practice in the four-power con
trol of Berlin for fear that the Soviet Union'and East Germany will use
them to further tighten access to the city, an enclave I 10 miles inside
East Germany.
