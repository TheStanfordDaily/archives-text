# U.S. will abide by SALT II
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan kept the
United States in compliance with the unratified
SALT II agreement yesterday by ordering the dis
mantling of two Poseidon submarines, but he
warned Moscow that he is prepared to exceed one
of the treaty's limits on nuclear arms by the end of
the year.
Reagan's decision followed State Department
recommendations to continue compliance with
SALT II despite repeated U.S. charges of Soviet vi
olations of the agreement. But the president ex
plained his action with an argument advanced by
Pentagon officials, saying that he was acting on
budgetary and military grounds rather than com
plying with a treaty he described again yesterday as
"fatally flawed."
In a statement in which he also said that future
U.S. action must be based on the "magnitude of the
threat" from the Soviets, the president said he had
ordered that two 20-year-old submarines, the Nat
han Hale and Nathanael Greene, each carrying 16
missiles, be dismantled to offset the introduction of
the Trident submarine Nevada, which begins sea
trials today. If the Poseidons had remained in ser
vice, the Nevada's 24 missile launchers would have
put the United States over SALT II limits of 1,200
multiple-warhead, long-range missile launchers.
However, the president said he would make "an
appropriate response" to Soviet violations by con
tinuing to deploy B-52 bombers armed with air
launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) unless the
Soviets take "constructive steps" toward compli

ance. When the 131st ALCM-carrying bomber is
deployed, probably in December, the United States
would exceed the SALT II limits.
Despite this warning, Administration officials
said the United States could quickly fall below the
SALT II limits again next year because two other
Poseidons may also be dismantled next year for
military and economic reasons. If this happened,
the United States probably would be in compliance
with the treaty until the next Trident is commis
sioned, in 1988.
One of these Poseidon submarines, the Alexan
der Hamilton, would have been among the two that
Reagan ordered dismantled yesterday, according to
a senior official, but the Nathanael Greene was
substituted because it had been damaged when it
ran aground.
Reagan had been urged by Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and Senate conservatives to
keep the Nathan Hale and Nathanael Greene in
service as a sign that the United States would no
longer tolerate Soviet violations of SALT 11. But a
senior official said the president decided against
this after he was told that it would cost $ 136 million
to overhaul and refuel each of the older Poseidons.
"That's a pretty expensive political statment," a
senior official said yesterday.
In an indication that the Pentagon is still fighting
to preserve its anti-SALT II position, a Senate
source said that Navy officials had told him yester
day that the service is planning to overhaul three

older Poseidons, including the Alexander Hamil
ton, rather than drydock or dismantle them. But
Administration officials emphasized that the final
decision on each submarine would be made by the
president based on military needs and considera
tions of cost effectiveness.
The president's decision, which officials said was
conveyed beforehand to the Soviets through
diplomatic channels, yesterday provoked critical
reaction from Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) and a mixed response from leading Dem
ocrats, who praised Reagan's action while ques
tioning his rhetoric.
"I am concerned that the decision sends the
wrong signal to the Kremlin," Dole said in a state
ment that reflected the view of 25 senators who on
March 12 had urged Reagan to renounce the SALT
II treaty. "We cannot continue to abide by an
agreement — an unratified agreement, at that —
which the Soviets are so blatantly violating."
But Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D.-
W.Va.) said that "despite the rhetoric," which he
said appeared to prejudge the outcome of ongoing
U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations, "the impor
tant thing is that the U.S. today remains in compli
ance."
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) said "the deci
sion is sound and it's regrettable that the president
saw fit to bow to right-wing pressure and disparage
the arms control rationale. The next decision is not
for six months, and I hope it will come after a suc
cessful summit meeting."

substituted because it had been damaged when it
ran aground.
Reagan had been urged by Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger and Senate conservatives to
keep the Nathan Hale and Nathanael Greene in
service as a sign that the United States would no
longer tolerate Soviet violations of SALT 11. But a
senior official said the president decided against
this after he was told that it would cost $ 136 million
to overhaul and refuel each of the older Poseidons.
"That's a pretty expensive political statment," a
senior official said yesterday.
In an indication that the Pentagon is still fighting
to preserve its anti-SALT II position, a Senate
source said that Navy officials had told him yester
day that the service is planning to overhaul three

older Poseidons, including the Alexander Hamil
ton, rather than drydock or dismantle them. But
Administration officials emphasized that the final
decision on each submarine would be made by the
president based on military needs and considera
tions of cost effectiveness.
The president's decision, which officials said was
conveyed beforehand to the Soviets through
diplomatic channels, yesterday provoked critical
reaction from Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) and a mixed response from leading Dem
ocrats, who praised Reagan's action while ques
tioning his rhetoric.
"I am concerned that the decision sends the
wrong signal to the Kremlin," Dole said in a state
ment that reflected the view of 25 senators who on
March 12 had urged Reagan to renounce the SALT
II treaty. "We cannot continue to abide by an
agreement — an unratified agreement, at that —
which the Soviets are so blatantly violating."
But Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D.-
W.Va.) said that "despite the rhetoric," which he
said appeared to prejudge the outcome of ongoing
U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations, "the impor
tant thing is that the U.S. today remains in compli
ance."
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) said "the deci
sion is sound and it's regrettable that the president
saw fit to bow to right-wing pressure and disparage
the arms control rationale. The next decision is not
for six months, and I hope it will come after a suc
cessful summit meeting."
