# Soviets allow 117 to emigrate

### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Soviet
Union has agreed to permit 117 So
viet citizens to leave the country to
join relatives in the United States,
marking Moscow's most extensive
family reunification gesture, the State
Department announced yesterday.
Department spokesman Charles
Redman called the Soviet promise "a
positive step that will contribute to an
improved atmosphere in our relations
and will facilitate efforts to build on
the progress begun at the Geneva
summit last year" between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev

Redman cautioned that it will be
impossible to be sure that the Soviets
will follow through with their com
mitment until the individuals actually
arrive in the United States. But he
said that the decision "gives real
meaning" to the Reagan-Gorbachev
summit agreement to resolve
humanitarian issues.
The tone of the State Department
comments contrasted with a state
ment yesterday by Reagan, who
accused Moscow of violating strategic
arms limitation agreements. The
president warned that the United

States would stop abiding by the
SALT II pact later this year unless
the Soviets end violations he said they
were responsible for.
If the 117 individuals are all per
mitted to emigrate, it would resolve
36 of the 126 cases on the list of
"divided families" that the U.S. gov
ernment is urging the Soviet Union to
allow to reunite.
Redman said the action would
"make the largest single resolution of
representation list cases since the
United States government began sub
mitting such lists to the Soviet Union

almost 30 years ago."
In addition, Redman said that the
Soviets had indicated that two other
cases, one involving the spouse of a
U.S. citizen and the other concerning
a person with Soviet and American
citizenship, would be resolved soon.
Redman would not make public
the names of the 117 individuals that
the Soviets have said will be allowed
to emigrate, but he said that members
of their families were being notified.
The Soviets did not identify the
people involved in the other two
cases, he said.
