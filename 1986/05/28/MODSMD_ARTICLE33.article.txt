Court: state rates great
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled
yesterday that state utility commissions, not the
federal government, can keep control of rate
setting policies for telephone service within
states.
Utility commission attorneys estimated that
the ruling would save consumers $1 billion
nationwide.
But telephone companies say that the ruling
means that they will be forced to hold on to
outdated equipment, a practice that may cost
consumers over the longer term.
Nevertheless, the justices ruled by a 5-2 mar
gin that the Federal Communications Commis
sion had exceeded its authority when it set
depreciation policies covering all telephone
operations, both within states and across state
lines.
"The language, the structure and the
legislative history of (the Federal Communica
tions) Act . . . denies the FCC the power to
dictate to the states as it has in these cases,"
Justice William Brennan Jr. said for the majority.
Meanwhile, in another case, the justices ruled
on a 6-3 vote that "standby letters of credit" are
not the same as bank deposits when a bank folds,
a decision that spares the Federal Deposit Insur
ance Corp. of what it called a potentially crushing
burden of liability.
In the telephone case, state attorneys hailed
the ruling as a victory for state regulators and
consumers.

"What was at stake here was more than
depreciation policies, but instead who would reg
ulate intrastate communication," said Gretchen
Dumas, an attorney for the California Public
Utilities Commission, one of 23 state regulatory
panels that had appealed the case to the high
court.
In the banking case, yesterday's ruling spared
the FDIC, the nation's bank insurer, of being re
sponsible for an estimated $120 billion in
standby letters of credit.
Trade reform possible
WASHINGTON — House Democrats, who
have been accused of playing partisan politics
with trade, have indicated a willingness to com
promise with President Reagan and the
Republican-controlled Senate in order to get a
trade bill passed this year.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski (D-III.) signaled this con
ciliatory tone just before the House overwhelm
ingly passed a wide-ranging trade bill last week
that Reagan branded as partisan and protec
tionist.
"I think there's a reasonable chance that the
Senate will act on trade reform in the fall, and
that we can go to conference and arrive at an
agreement that the president can sign," Ros
tenkowski said in his closing statement before
Thursday's 295-to-115 vote by the Democratic
controlled House.
"It's easy to bury trade reform under a welter

of partisan attacks," Rostenkowski continued.
"It's much more difficult to forge a bipartisan
compromise on an issue we all know must be
confronted.
Stocks near record high
NEW YORK — Stock prices flirted with a
record high yesterday, driven upward by weaken
ing oil prices, a stronger bond market, and expec
tations of both lower interest rates and a stronger
economy in the second half of this year, analysts
said.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at
1853.03, up 29.74 points from Friday, the last
day of trading before the Memorial Day holiday
weekend.
The previous record close was 1,855.90, set on
April 21.
Analysts said the performance, coming on top
of last week's overall gain of 63.49 points, indi
cates that the recent period of correction and
consolidation is ending or over. But there were
also signs that investors were not completely con
vinced of this.
Volume was a relatively quiet 121.16 million
shares — marginally higher than last week's
average daily volume of 118.20 million shares,
but far less than the levels of at least 150 million
shares commonly seen daily earlier this year.
Analysts said the Federal Reserve Board likely
will want to stimulate the economy because of its
sluggish performance so far this year.
