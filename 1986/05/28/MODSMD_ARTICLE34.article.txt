Senate approves budget
SACRAMENTO — The state Senate ap
proved a $37.6 billion state budget yesterday, but
the Assembly's budget deliberations bogged
down in a dispute over anti-abortion amend
ments.
The lower house put off a vote on its $37.5 bil
lion version of the budget until today, a move
that could delay work by a two-house conference
committee that will reconcile differences be
tween the two spending plans for the fiscal year
that begins July I.
The Assembly had planned to approve its
budget version yesterday, but instead got caught
in a complicated series of parliamentary
maneuvers over anti-abortion amendments
added to the budget last Friday.
The Assembly budget could be caught in a
prolonged stalemate, as many Democratic legis
lators won't vote for a budget cor - Mining the anti
abortion language, while many Republicans
won't vote for one that doesn't have the restric
tions.
Lawmakers are required by the state Constitu
tion to send a budget bill to the governor by June
15 each year, but that deadline isn't always met.
The Senate plowed through a half-dozen sets
of amendments before approving its version of

the budget 34-1. Sen. Diane Watson, a Los An
geles Democrat who was on the losing side of the
debate over two anti-abortion amendments, cast
the only no vote.
Senators approved four of the amendments
and rejected two, including proposals to increase
funding for anti-drug and alcohol programs and
to eliminate additional funds for local family
planning programs.
Waldheim ban urged
LOS ANGELES — The Simon Wiesenthal
Center said yesterday it's giving out 1 million
postcards nationwide, urging they be mailed to
President Reagan in a bid to bar Austrian presi
dential hopeful Kurt Waldheim from U.S. shores.
The postcards display a 1943 photo of
Waldheim in a German army uniform and a 1975
shot of him as U.N. secretary general.
"In 1947, Kurt Waldheim was charged with
'murder and slaughter' by Yugoslavia. Those
charges were accepted by the U.N. Crimes Com
mission of which the United States was a mem
ber," the cards say.
"As an 'alien," Mr. Waldheim does not have
the right to be allowed entry into the United
States unless he can exonerate himself of the war
crimes charges. Because of the uniqueness and

magnitude of Nazi crimes, we urge your Admin
istration to enforce the letter of the law and bar
Mr. Waldheim from our shores."
The Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies,
connected with the Jewish Yeshiva University
here, released a statement with the postcards yes
terday, urging Americans to send the postcards
to the White House.
Waldheim, backed by the conservative
People's Party, faces a runoff election June 8 in
Austria, opposed by Socialist Kurt Steyrer. On
Monday, he spoke with a group of students who
confronted him in Vienna.
Waldheim said he and his family were perse
cuted by the Nazis, who took power in Austria in
1938 and incorporated the country into the Third
Reich.
"If you think we had any sort of happy feelings
about serving in the German army, I can tell you
otherwise." Waldheim said. "We just had no
choice."
Cause of the day
Weather both today and tomorrow will be
sunny with highs in the upper 80s. In spite of the
sweltering heat, there remains no air condition
ing in most dorms. Are we just going to sit
around and take such unjust deprivation?
