# Concert Network doing well
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
May was a good month for the
Concert Network.
The network, which lost nearly
$5,000 in its first concert this year,
recovered all of that amount and
"quite a bit of the operating ex
penses" with ticket sales from the two
Grateful Dead shows and the
Windham Hill concert, according to
Scott Davis. Concert Advisory Board
chair.
"We were very pleased with the
Grateful Dead." Davis said. All of
Frost Amphitheatre's 9.500 seats
were sold for both days.
The Windham Hill show two
weekends ago sold a total of 1,700
tickets, with a significant percentage
of student sales, according to Linda
Christie, the network's business
manager. "We were surprised by the
number of students attending the

show," she said, though "we were
kind of disappointed at overall sales
. . . we drew a larger crowd last year."
She noted that the concert had to
compete with concurrent campus
events, including the Splendor on the
Grass party.
"Currently, we are not at the
break-even point," said Concert Net
work Director Patrick O'Hara, add
ing that he hoped some planned sum
mer shows would generate enough
revenue to put the network in the
black. However, he declined to give
any figures on the size of the deficit.
Specifically, at least one concert is
in the works for the summer. "We'd
like to do one Frost show to cover
costs and maybe one show in
Dinkelspiel to gain experience."
O'Hara said.
The Concert Network is trying to
avoid the fate of ASSU Special
Events, an organization which was
shut down in 1980 due to mis

management. Special Events lost
money nine out of the 10 years of its
existence, capping its career with a
$92,000 loss.
In the event of an overall loss at the
end of their fiscal year (which closes
in August), the network would he
forced to draw on its reserves. The
largest postulated loss "would not
threaten the reserve," according to
O'Hara, hut a few years of that kind
of loss would completely drain it.
The network was bankrolled by last
year's ASSU fee assessment of
$36,000. Of that amount, approxi
mately $25,000 remains as a reserve,
the balance being used as start-up
costs.
Two years old, the network is un
dergoing a series of evaluation
meetings stipulated in the group's
charter. These meetings should
produce a list of charter amendments
designed to keep the administrative
end running smoothly.
An open forum is scheduled for
next Tuesday in Tresidder room 132
at 7 p.m.
"There's been a lot of misun
derstanding among students (about
the Concert Network)," Davis said,
"this forum is a chance to explain the
industrial structure." At the very
least, Davis said he expects feedback
from students on this year's shows.
A concern of the network is the
opening of Bill Graham's amphi
theatre in Mountain View on June
29, which may divert Bill Graham

Presents productions from Stanford.
A spokesman for Bill Graham
Presents said that "there shouldn't be
any problem; we don't produce that
many shows (at Stanford) anyway."
"It's hard to compete with them,"
Davis agreed, pointing out that the
network was trying to get around the
problem by booking smaller shows.
"Other promoters are interested in
working with us."
"We probably wouldn't try to get
the Rolling Stones or David Bowie,
though that's not totally out of the
question," Davis said, adding that
next year's schedule will "possibly
have less of a focus on rock, though
club acts (such as those at the
Keystone) are being considered."
"We'd like to diversify," said

O'Hara. "The summer provides a
testing ground" for figuring out what
kinds of shows can be produced at the
venues available.
Overall, both Davis and O'Hara
are pleased with the operation of the
network over the past year. "I think
that it was a rebuilding," Davis said,
"we had some problems last summer
and we had to train a lot of new
people. We are improving; we've ex
panded the internship program and
we expect to have a lot of good
people next year."
"The network is in a growing
stage," O'Hara added. "The show in
Mem Aud was a pretty significant
step; we've got a better feel now for
what venues are available. And we
know now to plan well in advance."

venues available.
Overall, both Davis and O'Hara
are pleased with the operation of the
network over the past year. "I think
that it was a rebuilding," Davis said,
"we had some problems last summer
and we had to train a lot of new
people. We are improving; we've ex
panded the internship program and
we expect to have a lot of good
people next year."
"The network is in a growing
stage," O'Hara added. "The show in
Mem Aud was a pretty significant
step; we've got a better feel now for
what venues are available. And we
know now to plan well in advance."
May was a good month for the
Concert Network.
The network, which lost nearly
$5,000 in its first concert this year,
recovered all of that amount and
"quite a bit of the operating ex
penses" with ticket sales from the two
Grateful Dead shows and the
Windham Hill concert, according to
Scott Davis. Concert Advisory Board
chair.
"We were very pleased with the
Grateful Dead." Davis said. All of
Frost Amphitheatre's 9.500 seats
were sold for both days.
The Windham Hill show two
weekends ago sold a total of 1,700
tickets, with a significant percentage
of student sales, according to Linda
Christie, the network's business
manager. "We were surprised by the
number of students attending the

show," she said, though "we were
kind of disappointed at overall sales
. . . we drew a larger crowd last year."
She noted that the concert had to
compete with concurrent campus
events, including the Splendor on the
Grass party.
"Currently, we are not at the
break-even point," said Concert Net
work Director Patrick O'Hara, add
ing that he hoped some planned sum
mer shows would generate enough
revenue to put the network in the
black. However, he declined to give
any figures on the size of the deficit.
Specifically, at least one concert is
in the works for the summer. "We'd
like to do one Frost show to cover
costs and maybe one show in
Dinkelspiel to gain experience."
O'Hara said.
The Concert Network is trying to
avoid the fate of ASSU Special
Events, an organization which was
shut down in 1980 due to mis

management. Special Events lost
money nine out of the 10 years of its
existence, capping its career with a
$92,000 loss.
In the event of an overall loss at the
end of their fiscal year (which closes
in August), the network would he
forced to draw on its reserves. The
largest postulated loss "would not
threaten the reserve," according to
O'Hara, hut a few years of that kind
of loss would completely drain it.
The network was bankrolled by last
year's ASSU fee assessment of
$36,000. Of that amount, approxi
mately $25,000 remains as a reserve,
the balance being used as start-up
costs.
Two years old, the network is un
dergoing a series of evaluation
meetings stipulated in the group's
charter. These meetings should
produce a list of charter amendments
designed to keep the administrative
end running smoothly.
An open forum is scheduled for
next Tuesday in Tresidder room 132
at 7 p.m.
"There's been a lot of misun
derstanding among students (about
the Concert Network)," Davis said,
"this forum is a chance to explain the
industrial structure." At the very
least, Davis said he expects feedback
from students on this year's shows.
A concern of the network is the
opening of Bill Graham's amphi
theatre in Mountain View on June
29, which may divert Bill Graham

Presents productions from Stanford.
A spokesman for Bill Graham
Presents said that "there shouldn't be
any problem; we don't produce that
many shows (at Stanford) anyway."
"It's hard to compete with them,"
Davis agreed, pointing out that the
network was trying to get around the
problem by booking smaller shows.
"Other promoters are interested in
working with us."
"We probably wouldn't try to get
the Rolling Stones or David Bowie,
though that's not totally out of the
question," Davis said, adding that
next year's schedule will "possibly
have less of a focus on rock, though
club acts (such as those at the
Keystone) are being considered."
"We'd like to diversify," said

O'Hara. "The summer provides a
testing ground" for figuring out what
kinds of shows can be produced at the
venues available.
Overall, both Davis and O'Hara
are pleased with the operation of the
network over the past year. "I think
that it was a rebuilding," Davis said,
"we had some problems last summer
and we had to train a lot of new
people. We are improving; we've ex
