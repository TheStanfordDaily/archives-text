# Concert Network doing well
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
May was a good month for the
Concert Network.
The network, which lost nearly
$5,000 in its first concert this year,
recovered all of that amount and
"quite a bit of the operating ex
penses" with ticket sales from the two
Grateful Dead shows and the
Windham Hill concert, according to
Scott Davis. Concert Advisory Board
chair.
"We were very pleased with the
Grateful Dead." Davis said. All of
Frost Amphitheatre's 9.500 seats
were sold for both days.
The Windham Hill show two
weekends ago sold a total of 1,700
tickets, with a significant percentage
of student sales, according to Linda
Christie, the network's business
manager. "We were surprised by the
number of students attending the

show," she said, though "we were
kind of disappointed at overall sales
. . . we drew a larger crowd last year."
She noted that the concert had to
compete with concurrent campus
events, including the Splendor on the
Grass party.
"Currently, we are not at the
break-even point," said Concert Net
work Director Patrick O'Hara, add
ing that he hoped some planned sum
mer shows would generate enough
revenue to put the network in the
black. However, he declined to give
any figures on the size of the deficit.
Specifically, at least one concert is
in the works for the summer. "We'd
like to do one Frost show to cover
costs and maybe one show in
Dinkelspiel to gain experience."
O'Hara said.
The Concert Network is trying to
avoid the fate of ASSU Special
Events, an organization which was
shut down in 1980 due to mis

management. Special Events lost
money nine out of the 10 years of its
existence, capping its career with a
$92,000 loss.
In the event of an overall loss at the
end of their fiscal year (which closes
in August), the network would he
forced to draw on its reserves. The
largest postulated loss "would not
threaten the reserve," according to
O'Hara, hut a few years of that kind
of loss would completely drain it.
The network was bankrolled by last
year's ASSU fee assessment of
$36,000. Of that amount, approxi
mately $25,000 remains as a reserve,
the balance being used as start-up
costs.
Two years old, the network is un
dergoing a series of evaluation
meetings stipulated in the group's
charter. These meetings should
produce a list of charter amendments
