### STACEY ATTANASIO Staff writer 
As noontime traffic passed
through White Plaza yesterday,
members of SWOPSI 174. Issues in
Self Defense For Women, tried to
attract attention with a loud chorus
of "no."

Feature

Senior Julia Lavine then intro
duced the rally stating. "We are
taking the class because one out of
every four women is raped. . . . We
are asking you to join hands with us
and say 'no.' because for these sta
tistics to change, society has to want
them to change, and in saying soci
ety here. I want to stress that sexual

assault is not just a woman's prob
lem. it is everyone's problem. We
hope that one day. no one will have
to learn to defend themselves."
Indeed, the rally seems to ex
press the goal of this SWOPSI
course, which Beth Bower, one of
its teachers, described: "We teach
the physical techniques as a short
term solution and strive for long
term prevention through discussing
issues. Prevention begins long
before any physical action takes
place.
"Course discussions focus on
changing how we look at some
aspects of the world, so we are
aware of many societal influences
on rape and that it is our right to
fight back. We hope to give our stu
dents the physical tools to defend

themselves now and help them
learn for the future."
Senior Ann Fischer, another in
structor, attested that "from my ex
perience and those I know who
have taken it, it has been a life
transforming class, which has
helped them find strength in them
selves."
The teachers all feel strongly
about what they have learned from
discussing "sensitive issues and
common experiences and fears"
with other women, said junior
Cyndie Benjamin. She explained
that continued interest has caused
the course to "undergo a lot of
changes as an evolution of the stu
dents becoming instructors taking

Shouts of "no" rang throughout White Plaza yesterday at noon as students took an active part in a rally
sponsored by the SWOPSI course Issues in Self Defense for Women.
over the class and teaching what the
students want to learn."
The rally was an "action project"
for one of the self-defense classes.
Each class is required to organize
an activity that brings to the com
munity what the students have been
learning in class about rape and
self-defense. Action projects pro
vide the opportunity for the stu
dents to direct their focus on
women's issues.
Senior Nicola Jane McNeill
stressed that they chose to have a
rally because "it is not a man
hating movement. If it was, we
would not care enough to do this.
As soon as everyone realizes that
their mother, sisters and any
woman they have ever known or
been close to will be affected by
this, things will start happening."
Senior Sara Hutchison echoed
these sentiments, adding, "It is an
issue that affects all human
relationships — that's why every
one should be aware and involved."
Awareness seemed to be the
message of the rally. Judy David, of
the Rape Education Project (REP),
was invited by the class to speak at
the rally. A former member of the
class, David said, "I think one of
the most important things I took
away from the class was a sense that
men and women should work to

gether, and not against each other,
in trying to redress the problem of
violence against women in our soci
ety."
Homing in on awareness of the
issues surrounding rape, David
said. "It is necessary for all of us,
men and women, to find that voice
in ourselves, to say no' to what we
perceive as contributing to the ob
jectification and degradation of
women."
Another member of REP,
Patrice Callahan, was happy to see
SWOPSI sponsor this rally, because
"the biggest goal of REP is to make
people more aware — if people are
not even aware of the problem,
how can it change?"
Since the goal of the rally was
awareness, senior Beth Porter ex
pressed concern that "though
things went well and Judy David's
speech was excellent, there were
not as many people as probably we
would hope — but as it progressed,
more people did join in."
By the final rally-ending "no,"
there were at least 75 people
joining hands in the effort.
Junior Sheila Kelly said she came
to the rally because "it was interest
ing and a good idea — all you are
doing is saying 'no' to rape — but I
am curious to see people's reaction
to it."
Martha Enthoven, who caught
the tail end said, "It is great to have
something like this in a big open
place to make many people aware."

But others, like junior Marc
Jacobs, thought it "had a bit of a
ring of another campus protest."
Jacobs explained, "Although I am
very sympathetic to the desire to
get a wider public understanding
and awareness to the problem of
rape, the means of trying to round
up people did not appeal to me as
serious enough.
"I do not believe the impression
was intended, and perhaps it is a
cause of my larger frustration that
these issues should be less polarized
and there should be more serious
discussion of issues which have
been hitting the editorial page," he
said. "Because of the atmosphere
lately, the presentation smacked of
that."
While the mood of activism could
lead some to view this conscious
ness raising rally as another empty
display, others, like junior Mike
Goff, said, "I understand now.. .
no,' it's a woman's right."
Promoting this attitude would
fulfill Marie Sacco's goal in teach
ing the course: "What women need
is to believe they are worth defend
ing ... willing to fight and believe it
is their right."
As the fliers advertising the rally
read, "Everyone should be
respected when she says 'no' ." The
sound of almost as many voices
making the simple statement "no"
was a powerful display of support
for that right which everyone
shares.

Shouts of "no" rang throughout White Plaza yesterday at noon as students took an active part in a rally
sponsored by the SWOPSI course Issues in Self Defense for Women.
over the class and teaching what the
students want to learn."
The rally was an "action project"
for one of the self-defense classes.
Each class is required to organize
an activity that brings to the com
munity what the students have been
learning in class about rape and
self-defense. Action projects pro
vide the opportunity for the stu
dents to direct their focus on
women's issues.
Senior Nicola Jane McNeill
stressed that they chose to have a
rally because "it is not a man
hating movement. If it was, we
would not care enough to do this.
As soon as everyone realizes that
their mother, sisters and any
woman they have ever known or
been close to will be affected by
this, things will start happening."
Senior Sara Hutchison echoed
these sentiments, adding, "It is an
issue that affects all human
relationships — that's why every
one should be aware and involved."
Awareness seemed to be the
message of the rally. Judy David, of
the Rape Education Project (REP),
was invited by the class to speak at
the rally. A former member of the
class, David said, "I think one of
the most important things I took
away from the class was a sense that
men and women should work to

gether, and not against each other,
in trying to redress the problem of
violence against women in our soci
ety."
Homing in on awareness of the
issues surrounding rape, David
said. "It is necessary for all of us,
men and women, to find that voice
in ourselves, to say no' to what we
perceive as contributing to the ob
jectification and degradation of
women."
Another member of REP,
Patrice Callahan, was happy to see
SWOPSI sponsor this rally, because
"the biggest goal of REP is to make
people more aware — if people are
not even aware of the problem,
how can it change?"
Since the goal of the rally was
awareness, senior Beth Porter ex
pressed concern that "though
things went well and Judy David's
speech was excellent, there were
not as many people as probably we
would hope — but as it progressed,
more people did join in."
By the final rally-ending "no,"
there were at least 75 people
joining hands in the effort.
Junior Sheila Kelly said she came
to the rally because "it was interest
ing and a good idea — all you are
doing is saying 'no' to rape — but I
am curious to see people's reaction
to it."
Martha Enthoven, who caught
the tail end said, "It is great to have
something like this in a big open
place to make many people aware."

But others, like junior Marc
Jacobs, thought it "had a bit of a
ring of another campus protest."
Jacobs explained, "Although I am
very sympathetic to the desire to
get a wider public understanding
and awareness to the problem of
rape, the means of trying to round
up people did not appeal to me as
serious enough.
"I do not believe the impression
was intended, and perhaps it is a
cause of my larger frustration that
these issues should be less polarized
and there should be more serious
discussion of issues which have
been hitting the editorial page," he
said. "Because of the atmosphere
lately, the presentation smacked of
that."
While the mood of activism could
lead some to view this conscious
ness raising rally as another empty
display, others, like junior Mike
Goff, said, "I understand now.. .
no,' it's a woman's right."
Promoting this attitude would
fulfill Marie Sacco's goal in teach
ing the course: "What women need
is to believe they are worth defend
ing ... willing to fight and believe it
is their right."
As the fliers advertising the rally
read, "Everyone should be
respected when she says 'no' ." The
sound of almost as many voices
making the simple statement "no"
was a powerful display of support
for that right which everyone
shares.
As noontime traffic passed
through White Plaza yesterday,
members of SWOPSI 174. Issues in
Self Defense For Women, tried to
attract attention with a loud chorus
of "no."

Feature

Senior Julia Lavine then intro
duced the rally stating. "We are
taking the class because one out of
every four women is raped. . . . We
are asking you to join hands with us
and say 'no.' because for these sta
tistics to change, society has to want
them to change, and in saying soci
ety here. I want to stress that sexual

assault is not just a woman's prob
lem. it is everyone's problem. We
hope that one day. no one will have
to learn to defend themselves."
Indeed, the rally seems to ex
press the goal of this SWOPSI
course, which Beth Bower, one of
its teachers, described: "We teach
the physical techniques as a short
term solution and strive for long
term prevention through discussing
issues. Prevention begins long
before any physical action takes
place.
"Course discussions focus on
changing how we look at some
aspects of the world, so we are
aware of many societal influences
on rape and that it is our right to
fight back. We hope to give our stu
dents the physical tools to defend

themselves now and help them
learn for the future."
Senior Ann Fischer, another in
structor, attested that "from my ex
perience and those I know who
have taken it, it has been a life
transforming class, which has
helped them find strength in them
selves."
The teachers all feel strongly
about what they have learned from
discussing "sensitive issues and
common experiences and fears"
with other women, said junior
Cyndie Benjamin. She explained
that continued interest has caused
the course to "undergo a lot of
