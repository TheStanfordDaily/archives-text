### STACEY ATTANASIO Staff writer 
As noontime traffic passed
through White Plaza yesterday,
members of SWOPSI 174. Issues in
Self Defense For Women, tried to
attract attention with a loud chorus
of "no."

Senior Julia Lavine then intro
duced the rally stating. "We are
taking the class because one out of
every four women is raped. . . . We
are asking you to join hands with us
and say 'no.' because for these sta
tistics to change, society has to want
them to change, and in saying soci
ety here. I want to stress that sexual

assault is not just a woman's prob
lem. it is everyone's problem. We
hope that one day. no one will have
to learn to defend themselves."
Indeed, the rally seems to ex
press the goal of this SWOPSI
course, which Beth Bower, one of
its teachers, described: "We teach
the physical techniques as a short
term solution and strive for long
term prevention through discussing
issues. Prevention begins long
before any physical action takes
place.
"Course discussions focus on
changing how we look at some
aspects of the world, so we are
aware of many societal influences
on rape and that it is our right to
fight back. We hope to give our stu
dents the physical tools to defend

themselves now and help them
learn for the future."
Senior Ann Fischer, another in
structor, attested that "from my ex
perience and those I know who
have taken it, it has been a life
transforming class, which has
helped them find strength in them
selves."
The teachers all feel strongly
about what they have learned from
discussing "sensitive issues and
common experiences and fears"
with other women, said junior
Cyndie Benjamin. She explained
that continued interest has caused
the course to "undergo a lot of
changes as an evolution of the stu
dents becoming instructors taking
