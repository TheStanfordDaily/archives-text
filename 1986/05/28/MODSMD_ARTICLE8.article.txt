### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
In memory of the late Ernest Arbuckle
and his wife Katherine, Wells Fargo and Co.
has pledged $1 million toward the remodel
ing of the student lounge at the Graduate
School of Business.
Arbuckle, a former Business School dean,
was killed January 17 along with his wife
when their car went off Highway 1 near
Monterey and hit a bridge abutment.
'Wells Fargo can never repay the debt it
owes to Ernie Arbuckle for the wisdom,
guidance and prolessionalism he shared with
us, said Carl Reichardt, chairman and chief
executive officer of Wells Fargo. "His lead
ership helped make us the outstanding or
ganization we are today."
When Arbuckle left his position with the
Stanford business school, he moved to
Wells Fargo, serving as chairman of the
board there from 1968 until he retired in
1978. He continued to serve as director until
1983, when he was named director
emeritus.
"We can think of no more fitting tribute
to honor Ernie and Kitty Arbuckle than a
meeting place in which students, faculty and
others associated with the school can relax
and enjoy the interchange of ideas in pleas
ant surroundings," said Ronald Eadie, pres
ident of the Wells Fargo Foundation.
Business School dean Robert Jaedicke

thanked Wells Fargo for the gift, saying,
"the pledge offers a wonderful opportunity
for both the Business School and Wells
Fargo to work together in remembrance of
Ernie and Kitty, who played such important
roles in the lives of the two organizations."
Both the upper and lower floors of the
existing GSB Lounge will be remodeled.
The food services facility, which caters to
business students and others in the area, will
remain open for business during construc
tion.
According to Paul Johnson, associate
dean of administration for the school, the
construction of the Arbuckle Student Cen
ter is scheduled to begin in June and to be
completed just before students return to the
campus for classes in late September.
Johnson called Arbuckle "a person of
great vision, dedication and energy. He
really put this school on the map" during his
10 years as dean between 1958-68, he
added.
Under Arbuckle's leadership, "the size of
the faculty doubled, and the number and
quality of applications increased tremen
dously," according to Richard Kurovsky,
the news director at the Business School.
This school "was a much smaller and less in
teresting place before he got here â€” but not
afterwards," he added.
Johnson explained that the key objective
of the remodeling is "to improve the am
biance of the facility and enhance its useful

ness as an area for dining, study and social
activities." Students have indicated that they
want to continue to use the remodeled cen
ter for informal study group meetings and
for socializing, he said, adding that the
facility is also used for large group events.
The architect for the remodeling project is
the New York firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox
Associates, the same firm that has designed
the GSB's planned $16 million office and
classroom construction which will be located
adjacent to the GSB's existing four-story
building.
The food service area on the lower level
will undergo extensive remodeling, accord
ing to Johnson, and upon completion it will
continue to provide mostly sandwiches,
snacks and beverages, although a few new
hot food items will be added to the menu.
Seating areas will be reorganized to im
prove traffic flow while new tables and
chairs will be furnished. Other planned
changes will include an open-grid ceiling
constructed to camouflage duct work, new
lighting fixtures and a new hallway that will
connect one side of the building to a pair of
elevators on the other side, permitting the
entire Arbuckle Center to be closed off at
certain times.
Permanent booths will be installed in the
glass-enclosed upper level along with public
telephones and a small seating area.
