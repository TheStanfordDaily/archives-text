# Massive power outage affects whole Peninsula
## Power line failure is responsible, officials say 
### MARCUS MABRY Staff writer 
A massive power outage occurred yester
day morning, leaving the majority of campus
and most of the Peninsula without power for
over an hour.
The outage began at 7:! 7 a.m. due to
problems in a 60,000-volt transmission
power line running between Pacifica and
Half Moon Bay, according to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. officials.
The line apparently failed after a trans
former bank at a sub-station north of
Woodside malfunctioned. Workers did not
know what had caused the problem.
The outage affected an area extending
from Redwood City to Hillsborough and
across the Santa Cruz Mountains to Half
Moon Bay, causing confusion and traffic
jams throughout the affected area, according
to PG&E officials.
Disruption to the Stanford campus came
mainly in the form of stopped alarm clocks.
Power was restored to the majority of
campus before 9 a.m., University Operations
Manager Dennis Antweiler said.

Antweiler said that most outages cause
significant problems for academic depart
ments and computer facilities.
"I have not received reports from aca
demic departments yet. hut I'm sure (the
outage) was more than unpleasant," he said.
He reported that University procedures
during an outage entailed "finding the prob
lem. repairing it and getting as much power
back to as many customers as quickly as pos
sible."
The University has several generators
which operate only in the event of an emer
gency and act as a interim support to campus
facilities, according to Antweiler.
For the most part, Stanford students ap
peared to be unscathed by the outage. "I
woke up and my clock did not read any time,
and I thought 1 was in a Camus novel,"
freshman Pilar Keagy said.
Some, like senior Jackie Jackson, were
oblivious to the outage. "Because I'm an RA
I never get up before 11:00. So, I slept
through it," she said.
"I have a wind-up clock, so it was really no
problem," freshman Chris Mungia said.
