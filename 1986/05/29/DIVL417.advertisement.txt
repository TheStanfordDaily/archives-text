HYPERDRIVE.
Stop by our showroom and we'll put you behind the key
board of a Macintosh with Hyper Drive.
Hyper Drive is the hard disk system from General Computer
that turns the Macintosh into a true high performance machine.
It allows the Macintosh to greatly accelerate the process
in 9 °112 information —up to 15 times faster
than a standard Macintosh.
It can store much larger amounts of
information, too. Up to 20 megabytes—the equivalent of the data
you'd otherwise have to store on 50 diskettes.
And since Hyper Drive is installed internally it makes these
vast contributions to the Macs performance without contributing
to its size. With Hyper Drive your Macintosh (or Macintosh Plus)
remains sleek, compact and easy \ |
to park on a crowded desk. — GENERAI
