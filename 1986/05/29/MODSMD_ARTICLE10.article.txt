# Democrats seek student support
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Candidates seeking the Democratic
nominations for governor and the
12th congressional district agreed last
night they face tough races against
Republican opponents.
Gubernatorial candidate Charles
"Chuck" Pineda talked with about 20
members of the Stanford Democrats
in Toy on Hall, as did Sean McCarthy
and Lance Weil, primary opponents

for the U.S. congressional seat that
represents the Stanford campus and
Silicon Valley. That seat is currently
held by Ed Zschau of Los Altos, who
is a candidate for the Republican
Senate nomination.
Pineda, who is trying to wrest the
Democratic gubernatorial nomina
tion from the front-runner, Los An
geles Mayor Tom Bradley, took
strong stands on crime and education.
Calling himself "the anti-crime
candidate," Pineda said that he sup
ports strengthening the state's crimi
nal justice system by enforcing the
death penalty and requiring inmates
to work so their income can make
restitution to their victims.
Pineda, currently a state parole
hearing officer, also backed stronger
supervision of paroled inmates.
"Crime is the issue that concerns
Californians most, and it is the issue
that will decide this race," he said.
Pineda also said that if he were
governor, he would "give more kids a
chance" through an educational sys
tem "that doesn't allow anyone to ad

vance a grade until he or she can read
at that level" and "does something to
make sure that teachers in the class
room care."
To underscore the importance of
the education issue, Pineda cited sta
tistics that 50 percent of the state's
blacks, 40 percent of Hispanics and
30 percent of whites drop out of high
school.
Pineda said he believes he has a
good chance of overcoming Bradley's
lead in the primary, which takes place
Tuesday. He pointed to Bradley's loss
to Gov. George Deukmajian in the
last election, and said that if Bradley
is nominated he will "embarrass the
Democratic Party and pull other can
didates down with him."
Pineda argued that he is a good al
ternative because of the support he
has received from Hispanic-
American groups throughout the
state and because of his strong
showings in past elections despite
poorly financed campaigns. He
finished second to Leo McCarthy in
the 1982 four-man primary for
lieutenant governor while spending
only $7,000.
However, Pineda has generally not
been recognized as a serious chal
lenger to Bradley.
Pineda's daughter, Debbie, is an
undeclared freshman here.
In the congressional primary, not
many issues separate McCarthy and
Weil. Both call for reductions in
defense spending, humanitarian ef
forts to alleviate poverty, and a dis
mantling of President Reagan's "new
federalism."
McCarthy argued that "we spend
excessively" on defense and would do
better to direct funds toward educa
tion and welfare while maintaining
"only a 'fire department' defense."
"We need to recognize that we are

all members of the world community
and we need to help people,
McCarthy said. "We make no friends
by fueling regional conflicts through
out the world; we should direct our
foreign policy toward teaching people
in lesser-developed countries how to
grow food and survive."
Weil also chastised the current
defense policy, calling the Strategic
Defense Initiative "extremely dan
gerous." He also criticized college
students who "now seem to have a
Republican ' Rambo' mentality," and
added that "the 12th doesn't belong
to Republicans anymore."

"The Democratic candidates for this
district have all been suave and
debonair dudes looking like Lance
(Weil), but the question is, why have
they lost?"
— Sean McCarthy, Democratic candi
date for the 12th congressional district

But the district has traditionally
supported Republicans, and both
Weil and McCarthy conceded that
the winner of the Republican nomin
ation will have a strong edge in the
general election.
Weil, a Cupertino attorney, said he
and McCarthy "agree on most every
thing, but what the party needs is
someone who is palatable to the
voters,"in a reference to McCarthy's
appearance.

McCarthy, a water-heater installer
in Palo Alto, wore his work coveralls
and a purple bandana, while Weil
wore a suit and tie.
"I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with the way Sean (McCarthy)
is dressed, I used to wear long hair
too. and, although I wasn't as success
ful at it as Sean is, I even tried to grow
a beard. But this is a moderate dis
trict, and the people need to feel
comfortable," Weil said.
McCarthy countered that the
feature that distinguishes him from
other politicians is that "nobody owns
me."

"The Democratic candidates for
this district have all been suave and
debonair dudes looking like Lance
(Weil), but the question is, why have
they lost? Their (common) feature
that answers this question is that
they've sold out — they've had to
raise money so they can get their
names known."
Also seeking the nomination is Mel
Emerich, a Los Altos attorney run
ning as a write-in candidate.

restitution to their victims.
Pineda, currently a state parole
hearing officer, also backed stronger
supervision of paroled inmates.
"Crime is the issue that concerns
Californians most, and it is the issue
that will decide this race," he said.
Pineda also said that if he were
governor, he would "give more kids a
chance" through an educational sys
tem "that doesn't allow anyone to ad

vance a grade until he or she can read
at that level" and "does something to
make sure that teachers in the class
room care."
To underscore the importance of
the education issue, Pineda cited sta
tistics that 50 percent of the state's
blacks, 40 percent of Hispanics and
30 percent of whites drop out of high
school.
Pineda said he believes he has a
good chance of overcoming Bradley's
lead in the primary, which takes place
Tuesday. He pointed to Bradley's loss
to Gov. George Deukmajian in the
last election, and said that if Bradley
is nominated he will "embarrass the
Democratic Party and pull other can
didates down with him."
Pineda argued that he is a good al
ternative because of the support he
has received from Hispanic-
American groups throughout the
state and because of his strong
showings in past elections despite
poorly financed campaigns. He
finished second to Leo McCarthy in
the 1982 four-man primary for
lieutenant governor while spending
only $7,000.
However, Pineda has generally not
been recognized as a serious chal
lenger to Bradley.
Pineda's daughter, Debbie, is an
undeclared freshman here.
In the congressional primary, not
many issues separate McCarthy and
Weil. Both call for reductions in
defense spending, humanitarian ef
forts to alleviate poverty, and a dis
mantling of President Reagan's "new
federalism."
McCarthy argued that "we spend
excessively" on defense and would do
better to direct funds toward educa
tion and welfare while maintaining
"only a 'fire department' defense."
"We need to recognize that we are

all members of the world community
and we need to help people,
McCarthy said. "We make no friends
by fueling regional conflicts through
out the world; we should direct our
foreign policy toward teaching people
in lesser-developed countries how to
grow food and survive."
Weil also chastised the current
defense policy, calling the Strategic
Defense Initiative "extremely dan
gerous." He also criticized college
students who "now seem to have a
Republican ' Rambo' mentality," and
added that "the 12th doesn't belong
to Republicans anymore."

"The Democratic candidates for this
district have all been suave and
debonair dudes looking like Lance
(Weil), but the question is, why have
they lost?"
— Sean McCarthy, Democratic candi
date for the 12th congressional district

But the district has traditionally
supported Republicans, and both
Weil and McCarthy conceded that
the winner of the Republican nomin
ation will have a strong edge in the
general election.
Weil, a Cupertino attorney, said he
and McCarthy "agree on most every
thing, but what the party needs is
someone who is palatable to the
voters,"in a reference to McCarthy's
appearance.

McCarthy, a water-heater installer
in Palo Alto, wore his work coveralls
and a purple bandana, while Weil
wore a suit and tie.
"I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with the way Sean (McCarthy)
is dressed, I used to wear long hair
too. and, although I wasn't as success
ful at it as Sean is, I even tried to grow
a beard. But this is a moderate dis
trict, and the people need to feel
comfortable," Weil said.
McCarthy countered that the
feature that distinguishes him from
other politicians is that "nobody owns
me."

"The Democratic candidates for
this district have all been suave and
debonair dudes looking like Lance
(Weil), but the question is, why have
they lost? Their (common) feature
that answers this question is that
they've sold out — they've had to
raise money so they can get their
names known."
Also seeking the nomination is Mel
Emerich, a Los Altos attorney run
ning as a write-in candidate.

Candidates seeking the Democratic
nominations for governor and the
12th congressional district agreed last
night they face tough races against
Republican opponents.
Gubernatorial candidate Charles
"Chuck" Pineda talked with about 20
members of the Stanford Democrats
in Toy on Hall, as did Sean McCarthy
and Lance Weil, primary opponents

for the U.S. congressional seat that
represents the Stanford campus and
Silicon Valley. That seat is currently
held by Ed Zschau of Los Altos, who
is a candidate for the Republican
Senate nomination.
Pineda, who is trying to wrest the
Democratic gubernatorial nomina
tion from the front-runner, Los An
geles Mayor Tom Bradley, took
strong stands on crime and education.
Calling himself "the anti-crime
candidate," Pineda said that he sup
ports strengthening the state's crimi
nal justice system by enforcing the
death penalty and requiring inmates
to work so their income can make
restitution to their victims.
Pineda, currently a state parole
hearing officer, also backed stronger
supervision of paroled inmates.
"Crime is the issue that concerns
Californians most, and it is the issue
