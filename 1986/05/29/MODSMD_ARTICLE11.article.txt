## 
### JIM GUNTON Staff writer 
Former United Nations Secre
tary General Kurt Waldheim will
win next month's Austrian presi
dential election, a visiting profes
sor from Austria said here yester
day.
"There is an Austrian saying
that in this case I think is very
true: 'If you are a tenured civil ser
vant the only way that you can lose
your job is by stealing silverware
from your boss at his own party,' "
the professor, Gerhard Botz, said
of Waldheim's current front
runner status in the polls.
"If he takes millions or billions
of dollars, he could lose," Botz
said. Otherwise, Botz foresees
Waldheim capturing "somewhere
around 53 percent of the popular
vote."
Botz, speaking before a crowd
of about 15 at Haus Mitteleuropa,
addressed the impact of
Waldheim's candidacy on
Austrian politics. He then fielded
questions from the audience.
Begining in March, Botz said,
various media organizations, in
cluding The New York Times and
tfie World Jewish Congress, began
uncovering evidence that
Waldheim had been linked to Nazi
war crimes.
But Botz said he feels
Waldheim "was not performing
these things because he was a Ger

man racist, but because he was
doing his duty as a German offi
cer."
"There is no direct proof that he
was directly involved in these
crimes," Botz added. "If it had
come out that Waldheim had
signed an order (ordering that
such crimes be perpetrated), than
the case against him would have
been much easier."
Botz also indicated that he
believes the problem was more
one of Austria's governmental
structure.
"The real rfioral issue is not
really understood in Austria,"
Botz said. "Waldheim served as a
high (ranking) officer in the Ger
man army from 1942-1945, and
he would have known about such
things as the mass deportation of
the 40,000 Baltic Jews. He would
have known about the mass mur
ders.
"And yet, Waldheim's margin
of victory because of this whole in
cident will probably go up by
something like 2 percent."
Although Waldheim has yet to
be found guilty of the accusations
levied against him, he has "deeply
incriminated himself' with his lies
concerning his whereabouts and
concerning his ovyn knowledge
about war crimes that occurred in
places where he was.
"He would never have served in
the United Nations had all this
been known," Botz said.
