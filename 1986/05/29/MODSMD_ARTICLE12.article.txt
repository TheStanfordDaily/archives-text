## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Greater role for women 
### 
Nebraska is not a place one normally associates with
political innovation.
Recently, however, that state has unwittingly
become a showcase for the rapidly emerging role of
women in American politics. In Nebraska this year, for
the first time in the history of any state, both major
candidates for governor are women. Voters in Novem
ber will choose between Republican State Treasurer
Kay Orr and Democratic Lincoln mayor Helen
Boosalis.
Not just in Nebraska, but all across the country and
at all points in the political spectrum, women in this
election year are visibly moving into positions of politi
cal prominence. In the South, conservative Florida Re
publican Paula Hawkins is up for re-election to the
Senate. In the Midwest, Democrat Harriet Woods has
launched her second bid to become Missouri's junior
senator. All in all, nearly 50 women will be seeking
statewide office this year, more than ever before.
It is all too easy to forget that, until very recently, the
role of women in politics was essentially nonexistent.
In the 19405, Bess Truman once remarked that a

woman's place in politics was to sit beside her husband
and make sure her hat was on straight. Indeed, for
decades virtually the only women holding public
offices in this country were widows appointed to fill
seats vacated by their deceased husbands.
Even as women began to enter politics in increasing
numbers during the '70s and '80s, the focus of many of
their candidacies tended to spotlight gender, not
qualifications. Even the pathbreaking 1984 vice
presidential candidacy of Geraldine Ferraro, for exam
ple, had vastly more to do with Ferraro's sex that it did
with the issues.
It is encouraging in this election year to see such a
great number and range of women politicians seeking
public office. Clearly, the issue of a candidate's gender
is becoming less and less important. Boosalis and Orr,
Woods, Hawkins and others are running this year not
as women, but rather as liberals and conservatives,
Democrats and Republicans.
That two women are running for governor of Ne
braska has made headlines in 1986. We can only hope
that similar races will become commonplace by 1988.
