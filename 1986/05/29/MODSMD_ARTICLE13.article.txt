## Divest to stop apartheid 
### 
Before students depart in all directions for the summer,
I would like to thank them for their efforts during the
course of the year toward the ultimate destruction of
apartheid and towards the institution of one man, one
vote, in South Africa through divestiture.
One of the (questionable) benefits of speaking out for
divestiture and toward a unitary policy is that you are
placed on the mailing list for publications like "A Letter
from South Africa," and the Manhattan Report on South
Africa, by anonymous individuals who are all supportive
of the South African government. The fact that these indi
viduals maintain anonymity is a sign of cowardice, and not
the action of individuals convinced of their stance.

To whomever is responsible for placing me on these
mailing lists, I want to thank them, for they convince me
even more that efforts toward divestiture for a unitary
policy are justified. Let me quote from a gentleman by the
name of Leon Louw in the Manhattan Report; Louw is
from the Free Market Foundation of Southern Africa. He
says: "Historically, South African blacks have lived in
socialist Utopia. All of their housing, land, infrastructure,
medical care, etc., has been state-owned and operated."
And,"The fact is that economic growth has always been
the most effective force against apartheid."
The first quote needs no response, except that blacks in
South Africa should be delighted to learn of their good
fortune. Louw is correct, however, on the latter quote, be
cause economic growth can be an effective force against
apartheid; he acknowledges that apartheid has been effec
tively maintained by an economic system based on racial
exclusion and exploitation. At least we agree on the im
portance of economics, and it is for this reason that only
through divestiture and other forms of "creative econom
ics" (I thought the free marketers would like this term)
can political change be brought about in South Africa.
And, the political change I refer to is quite fundamental: a
unitary political system in which all can vote, so that the
collective will of blacks, whites and coloreds can deter
mine what changes will occur and when â€” and not leave it
to the thin, phlegmatic and diversionary generosity of
South African President P.W. Botha. The right to vote is
not an item to be negotiated, and there is no way in which
the right of all to vote will occur without divestiture and
other economic sanctions, or the real threat of them, by
most institutions, educational and governmental, in this
country and abroad. Dismantling apartheid and instituting
the right to vote can be done peacefully, but this is a deci

sion white South Africans must make, and soon. If this is
not done by them, it will be done for them.
It must be an uncomfortable feeling for blacks, who are
few in number, to be showcased by white South Africans
and white conservatives here, who share their views
against divestiture. One frequently touted in the Manhat
tan Report is Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, who has become an
apologist for the South Africa government. Responding to
leading questions by a conservative black, Chief Buthelezi
attempts to discount Bishop Desmond Tutu because he is
not elected by any black organization, that he does not
represent or is accountable to any constituency, and thus
receives too much media attention. It is clear that one sys
tem the South African government fears most, and is
restraining, is the freedom of the press; it appears as
though Chief Buthelezi has similar tendencies by wanting
to silence Bishop Tutu. Historically, we need not com
ment on the leaders of all colors throughout the world
who have not been elected by a constituency, but who
spoke about them, and spoke well. There are also many
examples of duly elected officials who became criminals,
or acted against the welfare of their constituency; we need
not leave the boundaries of the United States, or the Oval
Office, for examples of this. What becomes important,

There is no way in which the
right of all to vote will occur
without divestiture and
other economic sanc
tions. . . .

therefore, is the merit of what is being said or done,
whether elected or not, and what the Bishop says has ex
ceptional merit. What the Chief appears to overlook is
that, because of apartheid, neither he nor the bishop can
run for political office, whether elected or not.
In closing, returning to the borders of Stanford, once
again I call upon scientists at Stanford and at other leading
research institutions to reconsider their participation in
research and development with and for corporations
operating in South Africa.
