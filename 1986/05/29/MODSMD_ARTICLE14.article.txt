# Dusk waters: a short story
## 
### 
The summer Lance Janssen came to California he was
20 years old and he worked on a pier off Bodega Head
unloading fishing barges. The barges came from Gray's
Harbor and Willipa Bay down the Oregon and California
coasts to Cape Mendocino, and then, having skirted the
irregular shoreline where it juts out into the water at the
head mark, they docked at Jenner. The Russian River,
which runs through Sonoma County, empties into the
Pacific Ocean here, and the wooden ships where Lance
worked were on the northern tip of the harbor. From the
wharf, it was possible to see the ridges of the promontory
rise from the ocean. Over the headlands, the town of Jen
ner spilled onto the hillsides and dropped onto the valley
floor.
Lance had a room in the quarter of town where the fish
ermen and dock workers lived. It was a spacious room
with a gas stove, and in the mornings he rose early,
warmed coffee, and watched the fog drift off the hills.
Once at the dock, with the sun hanging past noon, the day

became humid and warm, and if not for the breeze that
came off the Pacific, the heat would have finished him
long before the last crawlers came in at sunset. On his free
days, to earn extra money, he went out in the local salmon
boats, dropping and hauling nets and drifting in the many
hours of beating waves.
He did not speak on the boats, either.
The dockmen and those who worked on the fishing
skiffs did not like the mute. They did not know where he
came from and did not understand his silence — and also
did not trust it. He is probably stupid as well, they
thought, and they cursed and laughed about him, as
people will curse and laugh about the unknown and the
misunderstood, over their whiskey in the dock-taverns
which remained bright on the whaif long after night had
dusked over Jenner.
But Lance had the imagination about him. On the pier
or out in the water, even though he tried not to think
about anything, tried to get himself ordered into the mech
anization of fishnet tossing and dragging, he thought of
distant places, and of distance itself, the space that had
come between him and what he had left behind, the space
before which there was sound but after only a great hush;
and then of being vaguely possessed with something he
was no longer possessed by, yet not able to relinquish it —
not because what he had lost had any value to him, but be
cause he had lost it.
The droning of the boats made it always there, indis
tinct but still there; the sounds and shapes of sound that
he could recall but not produce. But after he had been out
for many hours in the boat and then was returning and
saw the coastline and felt the warm sun on his back and
the homeward wind in his lungs and on his face, he mo
mentarily forgot the interval of hush he had been living,
displaced it, and the feeling he had was the same feeling of
seeing her.

For he also had the romantic about him. After the day
was done, he often walked back into town with Keenan, a
fisherman's daughter who also worked in the dock area.
She went along beside him and spoke to him, for she was
at that time in a young woman's life when she begins to
come out of her silence and has much to say that cannot
be said to her father or mother or even to her sisters, and
although Lance had not spoken back, she was not dis
couraged. She perhaps expected it, knew it — that there
would be those who would have to find a new way of
saying things, anyway.
As for Lance, he wanted to voice things to Keenan, and
often thought of her, thought of her as he thought about a
wave that laps up against the side of a boat out in the
water on a hot afternoon. And when he lay at night in his
room and looked outside his window, he imagined that he
was a field of reeds under a moon and that she was a wind
that came from the darkness and whistled through the
stalks blowing sound into the night.
The townspeople talked. It was first Keenan's father
who did not appreciate the time she spent with the mute
and then he spoke to the men in the pubs, and as they
drank more into the summer and continued to curse him,
the consensus was that it was not proper and not to go on.
Lance thought it was like coils and coils of rope falling
on him. He was walking to the corner of the wharf where
he met Keenan, the far corner past the salmon grottos, the
corner where the fish smell gradually thinned and the
town smells of cooking smoke and dry wood and barefoot
children foiled into the lungs. The day had been a long
one; he went out in a boat early in the morning and when
it came in at dusk he was needed to help unload. So it was
well past sunset when he was hurrying along the wharf.
Because it was late, and because most of the other men
had come off the docks an hour or two before, he was not
sure if Keenan would be waiting for him.
It was still the strong fish smell when they jumped him.
First he thought there were one or two but more kept
piling on. His face was pushed into the dirt and the bits of
sand and rock cut his face. They turned him over and
started on the body, slugging and kicking, curses and
whiskey breath mixing with the salmon smell. His face was
bloody now from their blows also, and he tried to cover it
with his hands. Then he was holding them out as if to say
no more, groping with them. They were swiped aside and
he was back on his stomach, and it was over.
The water would sting him, surely, but it was all Keenan
knew to do. She had seen what had happened to Lance,
had to watch silent from the corner, and after the men had
cleared away, she ran to him and helped him over to the
beach sand. She washed the blood off his face with the salt
water, put her sweater around his shoulders, his head on
her lap; and the two of them sat like that for a while, the
two of them on a dark sea-strand under a summer moon
in Jenner, California.
When the chill set in and he could feel it in her, Lance
rose and turned to look at Keenan, the looking that he
had had to content himself with, and when he looked he
spoke inside himself, saying that the world corrupts but it
also cleanses. Then came the guttural sound, decayed
from unuse but no longer by mistrust, a shape and form
moving through him, spreading from his lungs through his
throat and mouth and out into the August night.
It was his voice.

water on a hot afternoon. And when he lay at night in his
room and looked outside his window, he imagined that he
was a field of reeds under a moon and that she was a wind

from unuse but no longer by mistrust, a shape and form

It was his voice.

The summer Lance Janssen came to California he was
20 years old and he worked on a pier off Bodega Head
unloading fishing barges. The barges came from Gray's
Harbor and Willipa Bay down the Oregon and California
coasts to Cape Mendocino, and then, having skirted the
irregular shoreline where it juts out into the water at the
head mark, they docked at Jenner. The Russian River,
which runs through Sonoma County, empties into the
Pacific Ocean here, and the wooden ships where Lance
worked were on the northern tip of the harbor. From the
wharf, it was possible to see the ridges of the promontory
rise from the ocean. Over the headlands, the town of Jen
ner spilled onto the hillsides and dropped onto the valley
floor.
Lance had a room in the quarter of town where the fish
ermen and dock workers lived. It was a spacious room
with a gas stove, and in the mornings he rose early,
warmed coffee, and watched the fog drift off the hills.
Once at the dock, with the sun hanging past noon, the day

became humid and warm, and if not for the breeze that
came off the Pacific, the heat would have finished him
long before the last crawlers came in at sunset. On his free
days, to earn extra money, he went out in the local salmon
boats, dropping and hauling nets and drifting in the many
hours of beating waves.
He did not speak on the boats, either.
The dockmen and those who worked on the fishing
skiffs did not like the mute. They did not know where he
came from and did not understand his silence — and also
did not trust it. He is probably stupid as well, they
thought, and they cursed and laughed about him, as
people will curse and laugh about the unknown and the
misunderstood, over their whiskey in the dock-taverns
which remained bright on the whaif long after night had
dusked over Jenner.
But Lance had the imagination about him. On the pier
or out in the water, even though he tried not to think
about anything, tried to get himself ordered into the mech
anization of fishnet tossing and dragging, he thought of
distant places, and of distance itself, the space that had
come between him and what he had left behind, the space
before which there was sound but after only a great hush;
and then of being vaguely possessed with something he
was no longer possessed by, yet not able to relinquish it —
not because what he had lost had any value to him, but be
cause he had lost it.
The droning of the boats made it always there, indis
tinct but still there; the sounds and shapes of sound that
he could recall but not produce. But after he had been out
for many hours in the boat and then was returning and
saw the coastline and felt the warm sun on his back and
the homeward wind in his lungs and on his face, he mo
mentarily forgot the interval of hush he had been living,
displaced it, and the feeling he had was the same feeling of
seeing her.

For he also had the romantic about him. After the day
was done, he often walked back into town with Keenan, a
fisherman's daughter who also worked in the dock area.
She went along beside him and spoke to him, for she was
at that time in a young woman's life when she begins to
come out of her silence and has much to say that cannot
be said to her father or mother or even to her sisters, and
although Lance had not spoken back, she was not dis
couraged. She perhaps expected it, knew it — that there
would be those who would have to find a new way of
saying things, anyway.
As for Lance, he wanted to voice things to Keenan, and
often thought of her, thought of her as he thought about a
wave that laps up against the side of a boat out in the
water on a hot afternoon. And when he lay at night in his
room and looked outside his window, he imagined that he
was a field of reeds under a moon and that she was a wind
that came from the darkness and whistled through the
stalks blowing sound into the night.
The townspeople talked. It was first Keenan's father
who did not appreciate the time she spent with the mute
and then he spoke to the men in the pubs, and as they
drank more into the summer and continued to curse him,
the consensus was that it was not proper and not to go on.
Lance thought it was like coils and coils of rope falling
on him. He was walking to the corner of the wharf where
he met Keenan, the far corner past the salmon grottos, the
corner where the fish smell gradually thinned and the
town smells of cooking smoke and dry wood and barefoot
children foiled into the lungs. The day had been a long
one; he went out in a boat early in the morning and when
it came in at dusk he was needed to help unload. So it was
well past sunset when he was hurrying along the wharf.
Because it was late, and because most of the other men
had come off the docks an hour or two before, he was not
sure if Keenan would be waiting for him.
It was still the strong fish smell when they jumped him.
First he thought there were one or two but more kept
piling on. His face was pushed into the dirt and the bits of
sand and rock cut his face. They turned him over and
started on the body, slugging and kicking, curses and
whiskey breath mixing with the salmon smell. His face was
bloody now from their blows also, and he tried to cover it
with his hands. Then he was holding them out as if to say
no more, groping with them. They were swiped aside and
he was back on his stomach, and it was over.
The water would sting him, surely, but it was all Keenan
knew to do. She had seen what had happened to Lance,
had to watch silent from the corner, and after the men had
cleared away, she ran to him and helped him over to the
beach sand. She washed the blood off his face with the salt
water, put her sweater around his shoulders, his head on
her lap; and the two of them sat like that for a while, the
two of them on a dark sea-strand under a summer moon
in Jenner, California.
When the chill set in and he could feel it in her, Lance
rose and turned to look at Keenan, the looking that he
had had to content himself with, and when he looked he
spoke inside himself, saying that the world corrupts but it
also cleanses. Then came the guttural sound, decayed
from unuse but no longer by mistrust, a shape and form
moving through him, spreading from his lungs through his
throat and mouth and out into the August night.
