Disabled worker
still without
permanent job
At the governance forum of May 9,
I talked about the food service
worker at Florence Moore who
seriously injured his back on the job,
had a spinal disc operation, and was
told by doctors not to lift anything
over 30 pounds when he returned to
work.
1 stated that instead of giving him
work that doesn't require lifting over
30 pounds, the food service manager
at Flo Mo is "discharging" him.
Responding on Tuesday, Amy
Blue, director of Facilities and
Services, said that my statement is not
true (Daily, May 27). She said that
the worker was "granted" a leave of
absence, was "encouraged" to apply
for disability benefits, and offered a
temporary job this summer.
Several things should be noted.
First, the worker is now out of a
job. Second, he was not "granted" a
leave of absence because he never
asked for a leave of absence. He
asked for work. Third, he made it
clear he cannot survive on an unpaid
leave or on disability benefits.
In a letter dated March 19, the
manager of Flo Mo wrote the worker
that "at this time I do not have a posi
tion for you within the parameters set
forth by . .. your physician." At a
meeting on April 15, both the

manager and Employee Relations
reiterated this.
Interestingly, on the Monday after
Friday's forum the worker was
phoned at home and offered a tempo
rary summer job that will begin June
22 and end August 22, at which time
he will be out of work again.
In her letter, Amy Blue calls this
"being responsive in meeting the
needs" of the worker. I call it a cal
lous disregard of a worker who
injured himself in the line of duty.
I stand by my statement that the
Flo Mo manager is "discharging" the
worker, and "discarding him and his
worn-out back like the garbage she
discards every day."
When Stanford puts him back to
work in a permanent job, I will be
happy to retract my statement.

Appreciate rebirth
of student activism
So many activities of quality and
new-found responsiveness have taken
place during recent months, I feel
compelled to publicly and collectively
thank all of the energetic students,
staff and faculty members who have
contributed to a truly progressive and
remarkable year. These active in
diviudals have made celebrate diver
sity' more than a mere slogan during
1985-85: They have insured that the

ideological basis for Stanford's ad
mission policy, sports and artistic en
deavors, residential education pro
grams, and entire undergraduate edu
cation is fundamentally strengthened.
Through their celebration and ac
tive support, we witnessed major
public forums, as well as less grandi
ose debates on fraternities, apartheid
and social responsibility within the
University. These programs rank
highly on my list of events, for they
allowed for expression of the most
polarized of concerns in very personal
and human terms, much as town
meetings did in early American his
tory. Equally important were the
major conferences on public policy
and health issues such as the AIDS
conference and the successful benefit
which followed at Donald and Jeanne
Kennedy's house. Not only was this
the first such event at an American
university, Stanford individuals also
set a fund-raising standard for other
institutions which are sure to follow
their lead, and this standard makes
their event a landmark.
The continuing efforts of those in
terested in apartheid and our institu
tional connection to it have gal
vanized a wide plurality of students to
take the quality of their education
seriously (which we all hope will im
prove in innumerable ways due to
their efforts.) It takes a sophisticated
student body to make the kinds of
educational and institutional
demands we have heard this past
year, and this seems to indicate quite
clearly that our intellectual programs

are indeed working effectively. Cul
tural events such as the feminist film
series, the readings by writers
Adrienne Rich and Judy Grahn, the
Vietnam War Memorial at Stanford,
the discussion and critique of Rambo
at Branner, the native American Pow-
Wow, the Hawaiian Luau, the expo
sure to Hispanic mural art, the explo
ration of the stark banality of under
lying homophobia in a play such as
"Bent" â€” all of these events and the
hundreds of others which took place
since last September cast activism in a
richly golden renaissance light, and
reaffirmed my faith in students of the
"80s.
When it is time for all of us to look
back on the years we spent in associa
tion with this golden and exciting uni
versity, it is the diversity and celebra
tion which will amaze us the most:
that we were here, we took part in it,
we supported and encouraged it, and
in fact, that we were the diversity and
we lived the celebration.
