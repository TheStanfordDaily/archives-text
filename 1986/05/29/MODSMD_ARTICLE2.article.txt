Calling Stanford's labor policies
"oppressive" and University President Donald
Kennedy a "union buster," members of the United
Stanford Workers (USW) union and students
rallied yesterday at noon to criticize University
treatment of workers.
"This rally is kind of a follow-up report to the
community," USW President Tim Johnson said.
"We want people to know that Stanford has taken
no actions on promises it made to answer student
and worker complaints."
"Nothing has happened since the forum, and that
was weeks ago," Johnson said, referring to the
"Humanizing Stanford ' forum earlier this month
in which Kennedy and other University administra
tors confronted self-described Stanford "critics"
and others.

"It is like the University doesn't understand any
thing we say," Johnson told the small crowd
predominantly composed of USW workers gath
ered on Tresidder Union's back patio.
According to Johnson, the workers' demands
are:
• University commitment to affirmative action
principles when hiring and promoting employees;
• "Competitive" wages for workers;
• Increased health and security benefits and com
pensation;
• Retraining programs for long-time employees
who face dismissal;
• Increased University responsiveness to workers
complaints.
"Basically we are asking for respect and commit
ment. That's all," Johnson said.
Bill Northway, a junior majoring in political sci
ence, said he spoke at the rally to support USW and

to "encourage student-union ties."
"I think a strong bond between these two groups
is necessary because the University is very intran
sient on a lot of issues and we need this mutual sup
port to create change," Northway said.
In addition to airing general grievances against
foe University, tujjen ts. and workers protested the
University's firing of Victor Hill.
A USW activist. Hill was fired in the midst of last
fall's University-USW contract negotiations for al
legedly slashing the tires of his supervisor's car. The
University's charges against Hill were dismissed in
a pre-trial hearing because of a lack of evidence.
Union officials claim the University fired Hill to
discourage both spontaneous and planned activism
by USW workers during the contract negotiations.
University officials have denied these charges.
During the rally, workers and union staff mem
bers circulated petitions demanding the University
rehire Hill immediately.
