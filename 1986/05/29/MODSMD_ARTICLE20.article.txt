## Are y'all from New Yawk?

"Stanford is a melting pot of dialects," senior Fred
James said. There are Bostonians, like James, who in
sist the pot contains "chowdah," Southerners who
drawl over it, and of course, "New Yawkers" who
prefer the Big Apple. Texans and Midwestemers also
have their own peculiar accents.
However, as soon as Stanford students converge and
converse, their linguistic differences become less
diverse. "There is a tendency (for the numerous ac
cents) to homogenize in time," West Lagunita Resi
dent Fellow Rob Robinson said. He added, however,
"There is not a Stanford dialect per se. Stanford is a
good example of Walter Cronkite English: standard,
upper-middle class American speech."
Robinson isn't implying that everyone here speaks
exactly like anchormen. Many accents are preserved,
but later become less pronounced, so to speak. Media
may have nothing to do with it.
Junior John Mann explained, "I spend nine months
of the year in California. Stanford is [almost] 50 per
cent Californians. I just don't hear the reinforcement
of the Boston accent."
Many students with accents agree that there is a
subtle peer pressure to conform to the linguistic norm.
Fred Haberle, a junior from Texas, said it bothered him
to get teased bout his twang, "especially if the person
already has an obnoxious accent himself." Last year he
and a Boston native who lived across the hall "had a
huge accent clash."
Others, like junior Jim Panos, say they feel an inner
conflict toward speech conformity. "I don't want to
broadcast that I'm from New York. It makes you fit in
better if your accent is not detectable."
As a result, Panos tends "to Californianize (his)
expressions a lot." Freshman year, to express disgust,
he would have said, "Gross!" Now he says,"Vile!" If
something was neat, he used to exclaim, "All right!"
Now it is "Hot!" And an ambiguous object was once a
"whatchamacawlit," in his Brooklynese, but now it is
merely a "thing."
Similarly, senior Patrick Schultheis has incorporated

California slang into his South Carolinan dialect.
When he goes home, his family is, "not really into it.
Sometimes my mom wants to slap me upside the head
(and say) 'What's this 'dude' stuff/' "
When returning to Little Rock, Ark., senior Leslie
Darwin notices new things about Southern accents like
her own. "Every word has 18 syllables in it," she ex
plained, elongating the term "dahling" to last five
seconds to illustrate this.
Panos had a similar discovery. "When 1 went back to
New York after freshman year, it was really strange re
alizing everyone I was talking to had a Brooklyn ac
cent. Before, I had nothing to contrast it with, (so I)
didn't know (I had one) for 18 years."
Sometimes Southern Californians even find differ
ences in their native dialect that they didn't know
existed. Rick Woode, a senior from Long Beach, said,
"(Southern) Californians speak like they have some
thing in their throat. They can't really breathe through
their nose. It's not normal."
What is normal, according to linguistics professor
Charles Ferguson, is for dialects to diversify internally
over time despite homogenizing tendencies. This oc
curs especially when groups have "little or no commu
nication contact with each other."
Since entire dorms rarely communicate with one an
other as a whole, especially those on opposite sides of
campus, residents begin to develop their own lingos.
These become peculiar slangs, not accents.
Thus, a former Branner resident, like Mann, may be
torn between several linguistic influences. In a hypo
thetical situation, "If someone were to spill beer all
over me, as a Bostonian I would say, T can't believe
this.' As a Brannerite, I'd say 'Aw, geez,' and as a
Californian, I'd be laid back and probably say noth
ing."
Such surf slang may be in vogue temporarily, but for
those with hometown accents, their favorites seem to
be their own.
Robinson, however, likes all dialects. "I'm sad to see
them get lost. It's a precious part of one's heritage. If I
grew up somewhere (and had a strong accent), I would
be cultivating it"
