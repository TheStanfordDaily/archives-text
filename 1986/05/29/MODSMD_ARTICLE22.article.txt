## Lost Hemingway found in 'Eden' 
### ERIK MCDERMOTT 
"The Garden of Eden"
By Ernest Hemingway
Scribners, $18.95
Ernest Hemingway described this
novel's theme as "the happiness of
the Garden that a man must lose."
While it is a theme that runs through
many of his other works, it appears
here in a context much more timid
than the usual Hemingway topics of
bullfighting, hunting or war.
Similarly, its protagonists are not
coolly macho in the manner of a
Robert Jordan or a Frederic Henry,
or as strong as their respective
women.
Instead, it is the story of a promis
ing but insecure writer, David
Bourne, and his wife, Catherine, on
their honeymoon in France and
Spain. Initially, they indeed lead an
innocent, hedonistic life, which they
spend making love, drinking great
wine, eating caviar, sun-tanning and
swimming alone on sun-bleached
Mediterranean beaches. Catherine is
young and beautiful, and her fantastic
tan gets darker by the day.
One day, Catherine has her haircut
"as short as a boy's," and decides that
sometimes she is going to be a boy. At
first, Daivd is shocked and horrified
by this, but he soon accepts the
change, even complies with her re
quest to switch sexual roles — he
eventuallly has his hair cut and dyed
like hers. Both seem aware of the
"danger" in their new situation, but
are nonetheless willing to prolong it.
The situation becomes even more
"dangerous" when the couple meets
Marita, who is also young and sen
suous. Catherine is immediately at
tracted and draws the younger girl
into an erotic menage a trois with
David.
Catherine, it turns out, is insane,
and her tantrums grow increasingly
frequent. She becomes jealous not
only of David and Marita, but also of
David's writing. The three-way rela
tionship soon sours, and David,
unable to prevent this, turns to
Marita and to his writing for refuge.
Many have suggested that the

menage a trois is an account of a sum
mer Hemingway spent with his wife
Hadley and his future wife Pauline
Pfeiffer. Catherine is also very
similar to F. Scott Fitzgerad's wife,
Zelda. Perhaps "The Garden of
Eden" is the Hemingway equivalent
of Fitzgerald's "Tender is the Night,"
which is also the story of happiness
lost as a result of sin and insanity, and
which may also be autobiographical.
When comparing David Bourne to
other Hemingway heroes, it is tempt
ing to dismiss him as a weakling,
unable to control his relationship with
the two women. But this appearance
of weakness is deceptive. There are
moments when he is about to explode
at Catherine's excesses, yet willfully
restrains himself. From the begin
ning, he seems aware that his wife is
potentially insane, and senses ihat
harsh words will hardly help. So al
though he does go along with just
about everything she wants, this may
be the result of great sensitivity rather
than great weakness.
Hemingway started this novel in

1946 and worked on it sporadically
until his death 15 years later, leaving
an unfinished manuscript behind. It
appears he found it difficult to end
this work, and the manuscript grew to
unmanageable sizes. Undeterred,
Scribners' editor Tom Jenks managed
to reduce it from about 1,500 pages
to 247, without, he claims, detracting
from the novel's significant aspects.
It is not clear that Jenks succeeded
in this. In the process of cutting the
manuscript, three characters and a
subplot were abandoned. In addition,
the characters that remain seem un
real and insipid — this is especially
true of Marita, who only seems to
develop a personality at the end of
the novel. To a lesser extent, this is
true of David and Catherine as well.
However, the novel has flaws that
Jenks can't be blamed for. The plot
often drags; one soon becomes bored
of beaches and caviar and dark tans.
There are also a few too many des
criptions of food. When Hemingway
describes the "big beautifully fresh
egg that he ground coarse pepper

over sparsely and spread a little mus
tard on before he broke the yolk,
the reader's appetite may be aroused,
but his or her interest in the story cer
tainly is not.
In some ways, the unreality of the
trio's situation fits the novel's theme.
At the end of the novel, as the char
acters come into clearer focus,
David's own words seem to apply to
them: they start being "actual human
beings . .. and not figures in some un
believable play he had been brought
unwillingly to attend." This is
rejected in the story David is trying
to write about the elephant-hunting
experiences of his youth. Once he
becomes aware of the betrayal (in this
case, his own), one feels he becomes a
stronger, more distinct human being.
As with Adam and Eve. with the
loss of inni»cence comes a greater
knowledge and an ability to place
oneself in the world. If you are willing
to tolerate the flaws in"The Garden
of Eden." you may find this an inter
esting topic to explore.

wine, eating caviar, sun-tanning and
swimming alone on sun-bleached
Mediterranean beaches. Catherine is
young and beautiful, and her fantastic
tan gets darker by the day.
One day, Catherine has her haircut
"as short as a boy's," and decides that
sometimes she is going to be a boy. At
first, Daivd is shocked and horrified
by this, but he soon accepts the
change, even complies with her re
quest to switch sexual roles — he
eventuallly has his hair cut and dyed
like hers. Both seem aware of the
"danger" in their new situation, but
are nonetheless willing to prolong it.
The situation becomes even more
"dangerous" when the couple meets
Marita, who is also young and sen
suous. Catherine is immediately at
tracted and draws the younger girl
into an erotic menage a trois with
David.
Catherine, it turns out, is insane,
and her tantrums grow increasingly
frequent. She becomes jealous not
only of David and Marita, but also of
David's writing. The three-way rela
tionship soon sours, and David,
unable to prevent this, turns to
Marita and to his writing for refuge.
Many have suggested that the

menage a trois is an account of a sum
mer Hemingway spent with his wife
Hadley and his future wife Pauline
Pfeiffer. Catherine is also very
similar to F. Scott Fitzgerad's wife,
Zelda. Perhaps "The Garden of
Eden" is the Hemingway equivalent
of Fitzgerald's "Tender is the Night,"
which is also the story of happiness
lost as a result of sin and insanity, and
which may also be autobiographical.
When comparing David Bourne to
other Hemingway heroes, it is tempt
ing to dismiss him as a weakling,
unable to control his relationship with
the two women. But this appearance
of weakness is deceptive. There are
moments when he is about to explode
at Catherine's excesses, yet willfully
restrains himself. From the begin
ning, he seems aware that his wife is
potentially insane, and senses ihat
harsh words will hardly help. So al
though he does go along with just
about everything she wants, this may
be the result of great sensitivity rather
than great weakness.
Hemingway started this novel in

1946 and worked on it sporadically
until his death 15 years later, leaving
an unfinished manuscript behind. It
appears he found it difficult to end
this work, and the manuscript grew to
unmanageable sizes. Undeterred,
Scribners' editor Tom Jenks managed
to reduce it from about 1,500 pages
to 247, without, he claims, detracting
from the novel's significant aspects.
It is not clear that Jenks succeeded
in this. In the process of cutting the
manuscript, three characters and a
subplot were abandoned. In addition,
the characters that remain seem un
real and insipid — this is especially
true of Marita, who only seems to
develop a personality at the end of
the novel. To a lesser extent, this is
true of David and Catherine as well.
However, the novel has flaws that
Jenks can't be blamed for. The plot
often drags; one soon becomes bored
of beaches and caviar and dark tans.
There are also a few too many des
criptions of food. When Hemingway
describes the "big beautifully fresh
egg that he ground coarse pepper

over sparsely and spread a little mus
tard on before he broke the yolk,
the reader's appetite may be aroused,
but his or her interest in the story cer
tainly is not.
In some ways, the unreality of the
trio's situation fits the novel's theme.
At the end of the novel, as the char
acters come into clearer focus,
David's own words seem to apply to
them: they start being "actual human
beings . .. and not figures in some un
believable play he had been brought
unwillingly to attend." This is
rejected in the story David is trying
to write about the elephant-hunting
experiences of his youth. Once he
becomes aware of the betrayal (in this
case, his own), one feels he becomes a
stronger, more distinct human being.
As with Adam and Eve. with the
loss of inni»cence comes a greater
knowledge and an ability to place
oneself in the world. If you are willing
to tolerate the flaws in"The Garden
of Eden." you may find this an inter

"The Garden of Eden"
By Ernest Hemingway
Scribners, $18.95
Ernest Hemingway described this
novel's theme as "the happiness of
the Garden that a man must lose."
While it is a theme that runs through
many of his other works, it appears
here in a context much more timid
than the usual Hemingway topics of
bullfighting, hunting or war.
Similarly, its protagonists are not
coolly macho in the manner of a
Robert Jordan or a Frederic Henry,
or as strong as their respective
women.
Instead, it is the story of a promis
ing but insecure writer, David
Bourne, and his wife, Catherine, on
their honeymoon in France and
Spain. Initially, they indeed lead an
innocent, hedonistic life, which they
spend making love, drinking great
wine, eating caviar, sun-tanning and
swimming alone on sun-bleached
Mediterranean beaches. Catherine is
young and beautiful, and her fantastic
tan gets darker by the day.
One day, Catherine has her haircut
"as short as a boy's," and decides that
sometimes she is going to be a boy. At
first, Daivd is shocked and horrified
by this, but he soon accepts the
change, even complies with her re
quest to switch sexual roles — he
