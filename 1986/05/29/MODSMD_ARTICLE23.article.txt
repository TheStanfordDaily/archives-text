"Selling Hitler"
By Robert Harris
Pantheon Books, $18.95
In 1983. the world was shocked
and fascinated by the sudden dis
covery of Adolf Hitler's diaries,
which promised new insights into
the German dictator's mysterious
persona. Within two months of
their discovery, the diaries were
proven to be forgeries. "Selling
Hitler." by BBC journalist Robert
Harris, is a journalistic-style ac
count of the scandal.
As in a novel, all the major
characters are introduced in the
gradual development of the story.
In the process of telling the story.
Harris tries to show the faults of
the people and the system which
produced this enormous fiasco. At
the very least, he attempts to be
objective in showing the facts first,
then offering possible interpreta
tions and motives which could
have made people react in the way
they did.
Harris' writing is typical scandal
reporting in that the suspense and
unfolding plot are deliberately
manufactured to hold a reader's
interest for 387 pages. The ap
proach is only moderately success
ful. While the book is well written,
the sheer amount of detail is over
whelming, unless the reader has a
peculiar reason to be very inter
ested in all the intricate nuances of
the Hitler scandal. The breadth
and coverage of the detail is good
investigative journalism, but the
presentation could be reduced to a
more concise package for those
who don't want to know every
vagary and peculiarity of the
prominent perpetrators of the
scandal. The details are not always
boring, but unless one is very in
terested in an in-depth account of
this particular subject, it grows
tiresome at points.
Beyond this, the book does il
luminate some very important is
sues. This first is the gullibility of
the media, especially to sensa

tional news, which they are all too
eager to accept for the purpose of
increased sales and revenue. The
Hitler diaries came very close to
being published as factual truth,
while really they were only the
product of a clever but unsophist
icated small-time con man in Ger
many. This can only make us
wonder about the rest of jour
nalism and historical reporting.
Do major newspapers have the
same motivations as the National
Enquirer, with only a reputation
for truth and accuracy? The
safeguards which are supposed to
prevent journalism from creating
such a fundamental change in his
tory are destroyed by human
greed in a commercial media. One
wonders when the emphasis of the
media switches from the truth to
the dollar.
The other issue which is brought
to disturbing light is the fascina
tion of a minority of the German
population and some collectors in
the United States with Hitler and
Nazi memorabilia. The statement
which bothered me most was one
which called Hitier the capitalist
ideal, the ultimate self-made man
who managed to rise to the top.
This fascination leads to nervous
thoughts that perhaps not every
one rejects what the Nazi period
stood for, or at least understands
the suffering and tragedy of it.
Those interested in reading this
book will have several issues to
consider before embarking on this
story of human folly. The two is
sues mentioned above are cer
tainly worth the attention of an in
tensive study, and this book cer
tainly presents the facts which will
permit one to draw his or her own
conclusions.
In addition, the publishers of
this book do not seem to place
money before truth, they do take
advantage of the Nazi fascination
and salability: the book's cover
portrays black and red Nazi letter
ing and the swastika as if to sub
liminally alert the reader to buy
this book because it portrays
Nazism.
