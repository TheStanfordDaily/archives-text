"Roadside America"
By John Barth and Mike Wilkins
Fireside/Simon & Schuster. $9.95
"Mom. Dad, do we have to go to
Jolly Laughing Clown Land again this
summer? I hate that place!" pleads
httle Billy Baxter as the sweet wisps
of summer begin to tickle his nose
with hints of vacation and family
travel.
"No, Billy,' his caring parents
respond. "This summer the Baxter
family is going to the Connecticut Nut
Museum. Then we'll spend a week at
the Sod House in Strasburg, N.D.,
and then we're going to see a monkey
in a tuxedo."
"Boy, this is going to be the best
vacation ever!" exclaims Billy glee
fully as he runs out to the Baxter fam
ily garage to start the car.
What has happened to the Baxter
family? A severe case of Mon
dotravelitis has been affecting, and
infecting, American vacationers with
rampant paranoia over the last few
months. As lower gas prices and the
ever-growing uncertainties of inter
national travel have led many
Americans to embrace their own na
tional wonders, the need has arisen
tor an all-inclusive American travel
guide. The answer to, and perhaps
the cause of, this new search for
American self-awareness is a won
derful germ of a book, "Roadside
America."
Authors Jack Barth (Stanford,
1979) and Mike Wilkins (Stanford,
1981; MBA, 1985), have taken all
stops out of American road travel.
Disregarding the average and highly
boring tourist attractions — such as
the Grand Canyon and the Vince
Lombardi Rest Stop on the New Jer
sey Turnpike — Barth and Wilkins
travelled over 24,000 miles along
American highways, roads and dirt

paths to find the most off-beat and
amusing tourist sights in America, if
not the entire world.
From the Hare Krishnas' Palace of
Gold and their planned Krishnaland
Amusement Park in New Vrindaban,
W.Va. (so that's where all the money
they collect in the airports goes!), to
Henry, the pole-vaulting fish in
Wakulla Springs, Fla., the authors
have compiled such a fascinating and
hilarious list of bizarre attractions
that it would take the average travel
ler at least five years of constant road
travel to visit every place mentioned
in the book.
Thankfully, the authors have made
vacation planning quite easy for the
traveler who wants a week-long or
day-long tour of American roadside
attractions. The book is divided into
such chapters as "The Seven
Wonders" (South of the Border, Dil
lon. S.C.; Rock City, Lookout Moun
tain, Ga.: and Wall Drug, Wall,
S.D.): "Celebrities" (The Lawrence
Welk Museum, Escondido, Ca.;
Smokey the Bear's Grave, Capitan,
N.M.: and a wheat field shaped like
Will Rogers' head, Dodge City,
Kan.): and "Animals" (Rollerskating
Parrots, Miami, Fla.; Stinker the
Monkey, Miami; and fiberglass
dinosaurs all over the country). The
eager traveler may pick and choose
from over 200 pages of amazing at
tractions. Why, one could even take
the book's "Seven Day Elvis
Tour," commencing at the Elvis
Museum in sunny Orlando, Fla. and
coming to a grand finale in Las
Vegas, the performance home of the
once-living King of rock 'n' roll.
Additional sections of "Roadside
America" include a chapter entitled
"Over There Over Here," in which
one can find such sights as the
Oyatunji African Village in Sheldon,
S.C., and Sam Hill's completely
reconstructed Stonehenge ("the way
the Druids would have wanted it") in

Maryhill, Wash. These places suc
cessfully recreate the exotic feeling of
distant and dangerous lands within
the comfort and safety of our own na
tional borders. Watch out for those
Oregonian terrorists!
"Roadside" is, without doubt, the
most amusing book I have ever read;
not only do Barth and Wilkins pres
ent a side of Americana very few
have had the nerve, or knowledge, to
even examine, but they also present
their findings in such an attractive
(over 250 glossy color photos) and
truly hilarious manner, that even if
one doesn't have a car, the book is

well worth the $9.95 price. Heck, it's
even worth the walk to the National
Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in
Hayward, Wis., just to see the world's
largest fiberglass fish, which is longer
than a 747. You can even go inside!
American travel may never be the
same.
"Roadside America" is the travel
book of the '80s. Go to the Stanford
Bookstore and buy a copy. Get in
your car, pop a tape of "Born in the
USA" into your tapedeck, and hit the
road with the Baxter family. A wacky
and bizarre America is waiting for
you.


"Roadside America," a unique and comical travel guide to the United
States, offers a unique perspective on American culture.
