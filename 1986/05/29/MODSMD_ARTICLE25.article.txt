"The Blue Star," a novel by
Robert Ferro, tells the story of
Peter and Chase, two young, eay
Americans in Florence. The novel
attempts to portray the com
plexities of their relationships and
of their respective self-discoveries.
It fails, however, on both counts.
Ferro does not develop his charac
ters, nor does he manage the
subtle treatment which the subject
of homosexual love demands.
"Blue Star" follows the lives of
Peter and Chase. For a year in
Florence, they searched for some
thing they could not find —
something more, something or
someone to live with or to live for
— love, a primal unification of
self. But night after night, man
after man, they found nothing.
Peter originally goes to Florence
to develop his writing, as writers of
another generation did, to dis
cover, as Joyce put it, "away from
home and friends what the heart is
and what it feels." For this young
artist, writing becomes secondary
to his pursuit for experience. It is
in Florence that Peter discovers he
is gay. Art would no longer be the
path leading him out of his yearn
ing for something more, for love,
for this primal self-awareness.
After a year, Peter says,"I (have)
nothing to show for my year in
Florence except fragments that
(have) come to nothing." But,

during his last night in Florence,
he sleeps with the beautiful young
Lorenzo. Looking back after two
decades, Peter tells us, "In twenty
years since that night I have slept
with hundreds of men. But in that
long numerical count I never felt
what I did for Lorenzo, that single
night, the last night of the year I
discovered myself."
Peter meets Chase in Florence,
as they both take a room in th«
same pensione. Although Chase is
gay, their relationship remains
platonic. Chase is an undergradu
ate at Harvard who decides he
needs a year off; he goes to
Florence. He is a refined young
man, adventurous, sort of living on
the edge. Chase attracts, and
nearly sleeps with, every breathing
homosexual in Florence. He ends
up marrying an aristocrat because
he needs to produce an heir for the
family fortune. Sex with a woman
disgusts him, but he does it all the
same: it's new; it's different. And
he succeeds. But Chase soon
becomes tired of being an Italian
aristocrat, so he leaves and returns
to Harvard.
After 15 years, Peter and Chase
return to Florence together. They
take a cruise on the yacht, "The
Blue Star." Chase sees his son for
the first time since he left Italy.
Peter looks up Lorenzo, who is
married but remains gay, and
invites him on the cruise. It is on
this boat that everyone realizes
that circumstances will not permit
them to have that something more,
but they all come to a compromise
which does allow them to have
something.
