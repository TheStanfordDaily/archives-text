# Stanford grad student prepares 'Red Wagon' for market
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
This is the firud article in a series
about " The Red Wagon," a film being
miide under the auspices of Stanford's
graduate film program. Written and
directed by grad student Kincaid
Jones, the film is perhaps best de
scribed as a modern-day fable. It tells
the story of Peter, a lonely boy embit
tered by his parents' recent divorce,
who encounters a magic red wagon.
Through the wagon's friendship Peter
becomes happy again, and he and his
parents come to terms with their situa
tion.
There are many advantages to
shooting a film on location. Filming in
a studio is often less difficult, since
the crew has more control over light
ing and there is no extraneous noise.
But location filming is more exciting.
The use of natural settings gives a
film a sense of realism — a vitality —
that cannot be duplicated in the
studio.
Kincaid Jones is fortunate in that
San Francisco is quite close to Stan
ford, which has enabled her to shoot
several key scenes from her film,
"The Red Wagon," in the City. With
its dizzying canyons and concrete
heights, San Francisco is so cinematic
that some of its locations practically
beg to be put on film.
Director Jones has discovered one
of the more impressive locales, at the
junction of Union and Montgomery
streets. In the background looms the
distinctive shape of the Transamerica
Building. In another direction, the
sun sparkles on the ocean and the
Bay Bridge. These landmarks provide
a great backdrop, for they can serve
as trademarks of San Francisco for
the film's audience.
The scene to be filmed here is fairly
simple. Peter is walking down a hill in
a desultory manner, followed by the
erratic little red wagon. Since the
wagon is "magic" and moves of its

own will, it will be guided by remote
control.
Guiding the wagon is special effects
man Jerry Guerrero, who also de
signed and produced the wagon's me
chanical features. Guerrero describes
himself as a "mad scientist type," an
assessment which has some truth to it.
When it comes to technology, Guer
rero is something of a visionary.
In the past, Guerrero designed and
created a prosthetic hand that
achieved an amazing 75 percent of
the dexterity of a human hand. Cur
rently he is working on a robot for
domestic use, and dreams of "doing
for robotics what Apple did for home
computers — 1 want to give robotics a
practical domestic application."
Of his "Red Wagon" experience,
he says, "I've learned a lot working
on this movie. It's been trial and error
with the wagon all the way, since I
had no blueprint to go by."
Guerrero's wagon attracts some at
tention as he tests its remote control
device. Curious passers-by at Union
and Montgomery stare at it in open
consternation. The scene involving
the mechanical wagon goes fairly
smoothly, despite some battery trou
ble with the wagon.
The filming process is made much
simpler by the fact that no sound is
being recorded; the filmmakers don't
need to worry about cars, slamming
doors or airplanes passing overhead.
Far more complicated is a scene on
21st Street involving sound, more ac
tors and a garbage truck. In the script,
Peter has run away from home and
wanders the city streets with his
wagon. At one point he hides it
among some cardboard boxes and
garbage cans. Sadly, however, just as
he is found by his parents, he sees his
beloved wagon being smashed to bits
in a garbage truck. He runs to save
the wagon but is held back by the two
garbage collectors, who fear that he
will hurt himself.
Jones obtained the garbage truck

by approaching the Golden Gate Dis
posal Co., which was generous
enough to provide both a vehicle and
a garbage collector, Mario Puccinelli.
Working as Puccinelli's partner in
this scene is actor Kevin Holtzer.
Holtzer, whose background includes
doing commercials in Germany and
on the East Coast, originally audi
tioned for the part of Stephen, Peter's
father in"The Red Wagon." That
role went to Michael O'Brien, but
Jones was sufficiently impressed by
Holtzer to give him this small role.
The garbage truck, for its part,
delivers a sterling performance. Since
Guerrero's mechanical wagon is too
valuable to destroy, one of three ordi
nary wooden wagons donated by
Radio Steele & Manufacturing Com
pany is thrown into the back of the
truck. When the truck's trash com
pactor is turned on, the wagon is

crumpled with a satisfying crunch.
Location filming is always hectic
because of the various people who
randomly wander onto the location.
Since this scene is being filmed on a
street, cars drive through frequently.
This causes problems for sound
recorder Tina DiFeliciantonio and
boom person Kevin Brooks, who are
already fighting San Francisco's fierce
winds.
Fortunately, assistant director
Lynn Mueller is able to stop several
drivers and explain to them about
the filming. Most people prove will
ing enough to wait in their cars for a
moment to keep from ruining a sound
take or coming into the camera
frame.
One small but important scene calls
for a front doorway, and Dr. Elaine
Daniels has offered the crew the use

of her porch on 21st Street. Huddled
together on a small stair landing are
Jones, cinematographer Jay Cle
ments, the two sound people and four
actors.
Elizabeth Jenkins, O'Brien and
Melissa Martin join 12-year-old
Kevin Hall, who plays Peter, in front
of the camera.
Jenkins played a hit part in the film
"Ghost Story" and appeared in a
recent Safeway commercial. Here,
she has a small role as the mother of
one of Peter's friends.
Playing Peter's parents, Stephen
and Jessica, are O'Brien and Martin.
In addition to working in a multitude
of radio and TV commercials (most
notably as Duff-on-the-Diamond in
recent Giants' radio spots), O'Brien
is an original member of the National
Theatre of the Deranged, an im
provisational satire group which has
performed in San Francisco the last
five years. He also designed his own
major in college, studying the history
and psychology of comedy and re
ceiving the only degree in comedy
ever given by Goddard College in
Vermont.
After performing in Europe this
summer, he plans to write and
produce his own independent film.
His goal in making the film, he says,
will be to use San Francisco's best ac
tors and comics as they've never been
used before.
"I'm very impressed with the
professionalism of the Stanford film
department. The people on this crew
really work well together," O'Brien
says between takes.
Also impressed with the crew's
teamwork is Melissa Martin, the
actress playing Peter's mother.
"1 know there's not a lot of money
involved, but there's a real sense of
spirit on this production," she says.
Although she received a degree in
marine biology from Cal Poly, Martin
has been acting all her life. She
recently appeared in "March of the

Falsettos," a musical which ran for 10
weeks in San Francisco.
"The Red Wagon" is her second
film. She apppered briefly in an inde
pendently made horror film with the
curious title of "The Video Dead,"
which has yet to find a distributor.
Martin's face may become familiar to
TV viewers, for she has recently com
pleted commercials for Clorox and
the San Jose Mercury News.
Because "The Red Wagon" is
being financed by a $15,000 grant
from Theodore and Frances Geballe,
all the budget must go to technical
costs. No one working on the film is
getting paid, and Jones is asking local
businesses for tax-deductible contri
butions of accommodations, services
and food.
For example, during the day's
shoot in San Francisco, Fat Apples
restaurant provides breakfast,
Truffles Catering in Menlo Park con
tributes lunch, and Rudolfo's restau
rant does the honors for dinner.
The actors have agreed to work for
deferred payment. They are depend
ing on Jones to sell the film, and there
are some encouraging signs that this
could happen. In 1984, a film on
Rodin produced by a Stanford stu
dent won the Student Academy
Award, while Home Box Office
bought another Stanford film,
"Moonchild," made by Ann
Makepeace.
Jones has worked for HBO in the
past, and this may prove to be a
valuable contact when she begins to
sell her film. She also hopes to have
the film shown in schools, because it
deals with the children of divorce. Its
educational nature has Jones also
considering the Public Broadcasting
System as a potential market.
Jones is optimistic about the appeal
of her film.
"Everybody has their own special
memory of owning a wagon," she
says."I hope to capture the child in
people of all ages."
