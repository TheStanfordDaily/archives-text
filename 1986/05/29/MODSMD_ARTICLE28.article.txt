## Golfers buried deep in pack at tournament 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
The good news for the Stanford
men's golf team yesterday was that
Carl Wagner and Don Walsworth
were named to the NCAA Aca
demic All-America team.
The bad news . . . well, hope
fully, that will turn around. But for
the time being, the Cardinal is in
27th place out of 3 I teams at the
NCAA championships in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
"1 don't think the course played
that difficultly," Stanford Coach
Tim Schaaf said. "The pin position
was tough, but the tees were up a
fair bit. . . . We didn't play very
well."
Stanford's 19-over-par round of
307 leaves it 21 strokes behind co
leaders Oklahoma and host Wake
Forest. Miami is two strokes be
hind in third place at 288, while
favored Oklahoma State is three
off at 289.
A couple of three-way ties fol
low OSU: Lamar, Fresno State
and Louisiana State in fifth at 292,
and Furman, North Carolina and
Oregon in eighth at 293.
"To me it's surprising that Brig
ham Young is not in the top 10,"
Schaaf said. "I'm surprised BYU
and USC didn't play better."
Among the individuals, there is
another three-way tie. Clemson's
Brad Clark, Wake Forest's Tim
Straub and OSU's Scott Verplank
each fired three-under-par 695.
Stanford was led by Walsworth,
who carded a 74 on the Bermuda
Run Golf Course. Brad Geer was

next with a 76, with Wagner right
behind him at 77. Roger Miraglia
and Phil Rowley shot 80 and 83,
respectively.
" Don, Carl and Brad played
pretty well most of the day but
they didn't finish that strongly,"
Schaaf said.
Wagner, for example, double
bogeyed the 16th hole and
bogeyed the 18th.
"For Roger, Phil and Brad it's
their first appearance in nationals,
and 1 think it's a bit of the first-day
jitters," Schaaf said. "They played
better as a group in practice, and I
expected them to do better.
"When it's your first time out
and you don't get off to a good
start, it's hard to play to your abil
ity," he continued. "I think they'll
play better as they get more com
fortable. This is the big event â€” a
little intimidating maybe.
"It's a four-round tournament;
we're off to a slow start," Schaaf
said. "If you can average under
300 you can usually finish in the
top 15."
Schaaf made special mention of
the honor given to Wagner and
Walsworth, who were named to
the All-Pacific 10 Conference
team earlier.
"What I think is of importance
is that our number one and two
men last year, Tim Robinson and
Scott Erickson, were named last
year," Schaaf said. "(That's) four
people in the three years the
award has been in existence, tops
of any other school."
Just another example of ath
letics and academics coexisting at
Stanford.
