# Women end first day in 13th

### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Despite being tied for 13th after the first round of the
NCAA Championships at Ohio State, the Stanford
women's golf team, according to Cardinal Coach Tim
Baldwin, is by no means ready to call it quits.
"I think that the team we have here, especially the four
veterans, is going to do a real strong number," Baldwin
said from Columbus, Ohio. "I'm not really counting our
selves out of it yet."
Baldwin has reason to be optimistic, as there were a
number of surprises in Columbus. Stanford, ranked fourth
nationally, shot 3 10 yesterday, landing itself in a tie with
Furman and UCLA, 16 strokes behind No. 14 Miami. At
295, 9th-ranked Southern Methodist is one stroke off the
pace of the surprising Hurricanes, while Florida, the na
tion's top-ranked team, is third at 297.
Sixth-ranked Louisiana State is fourth at 300, with No.
3 San Jose State and No. 5 USC at 301 and 305,
respectively. Second-ranked Tulsa, one of the favorites to
win the tournament, is tied for seventh with Duke and
Georgia at 306.
"It's the best Miami has played all year. It's the best
SMU's played all year," Baldwin said. "A lot is going to
happen between now and Saturday."
Julie Carmichael, whose drive of 290 yards Monday set
an NCAA record in the long-distance driving competi
tion, led the Cardinal individuals yesterday. Carmichael
fired a 75 on the par-73, 6,200-yard Scarlet Golf Course
to better teammate Kathleen McCarthy by one swing.
"I felt pretty good — extremely good about the way
Julie Carmichael and Kathleen McCarthy played,"
Baldwin said.
Kay Cornelius shot a 78 yesterday, while Kathy Kostas
swung to an 81. Adrienne Gilmartin's 85 rounded out the
Stanford scoring.
"We're expecting more the rest of the tournament out
of Kay Cornelius and Kathy Kostas," Baldwin com
mented. "Both of those two were playing well going into
the tournament. I surely do anticipate moving up."
Baldwin also noted the effect of heavy fog, which
delayed the start until 1 p.m.
"It was just a long day for us," he said. "Tomorrow
we're playing really early — I'm expecting a good day out
of us."
Perhaps the biggest surprise was atop *he individual
leader board, as Barbara Van Strein, a walk-on at LSU,
led with a four-under-par 69.
"She's a freshman, and she's an exchange student from
Holland," Baldwin said. "She just played her career-best
round."
SMU's Jamie DeWeese shot a 70, leaving her a stroke
back in second place, with Florida's Lori Kean and
Miami's Jill Briles knotted a stroke behind her in third.
Tied for fifth at 72 are Florida's Cheryl Moley, SMU's
Martha Foyer, Indiana's Sarah Dekraay and Longwood
College's Tina Barrett.
"Out of those top eight players not one was a first team
All-American," Baldwin said.
"This is the first major tournament we've played in
since last fall that we've held our own in the first round."
he went on. "We consistently seem to get better each
round. I'm expecting us to inch up each round day by
day."
