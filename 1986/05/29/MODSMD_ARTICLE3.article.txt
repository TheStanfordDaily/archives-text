# New senate reaffirms fund

### SYDNEY SMITH Senior staff writer 
In the first official meeting of the 17th ASSU Senate
last night, new senators reaffirmed the 16th senate's deci
sion to cooperate in the establishment of the "Free South
Africa Fund."
The fund intends to offer an alternative to Stanford
donors who may not wish their gifts to the University in
vested in companies that do business with South Africa.
The bill approving the fund was passed over objections
that the fund's trustees may have too much power in the
disbursement of the money should the University fail to
divest or South Africa fail to reach black majority rule.

According to the bill, if the University fails to divest
from South Africa within a certain number of years, all
money that has been collected in the fund will be donated
to an "appropriate charity to benefit black South
Africans." Graduate Senator Steve Hellman opposed this
stipulation, saying it "gives trustees an enormous amount
of power" as to where the money should go.
Senior Laurie Edelstein, one of the fund's four trustees,
said the time limit for the University's divestment will
"probably be 15 years." Given that time frame, she said,
the trustees "can't possibly say which charity we will send
the money to."
