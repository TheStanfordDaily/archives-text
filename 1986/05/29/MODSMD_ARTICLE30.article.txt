# The
						relative merits of being 'last' and the pressure of being the best
## 
### 
The word "last" is difficult to swallow (can I say
that in the '80s?) in the sporting world. It's a cruel
sound.
No one wants to be associated with it. It means
that you're the runt of the litter, the by-product of
cheese, the 5,000 of the Draw — in short, you're no
top banana. OK, I'll stop.
"Last" begins early in one's sports life, most
likely on the playgrounds. Grade school tiny tots
would stand around watching the team captains,
who were usually mutant physical strains resem
bling towering oaks among pre-pubescent shrub
bery, choose the sides for kickball.
"It's your pick," one captain would say. The
other would stare glumly at the remaining four or
five choices, wondering which player would be the
least liability. Finally, it came down to you (John
Paye probably excluded) and the other guy. who
was wearing a cast on his left leg. The other guy
won out. You — yes, you — were "last." Meta
phorically once more, you were no better off than
leftover Spam.
"Last" continues through youth. If you played
softball or Little League, you might understand this
next step in sporting ineptitude — call it "team
last."

Team mothers, as they were called, had the most
influence on a team that charged home "last."
Expressions like "nice try" or "go get em" were
the customary cries. You might be called a "Charlie
Hustle," or even described as that "little competi
tor" who gives "110 percent" all the time.

After the season was over, your record at 2-14,
team awards were given out. The whole team won
"most improved'* because of that "late season
charge."
These were psychological sports "lasts" at a time
when youth gave way to sensitive, impressionable
feelings. Potentially, "last" could be more
destructive back then.
As time goes by — a moving lyric in most top-40
songs — "last" can take on new, more positive

meaning. It can be stylish.
Being "last" in Stanford intramurals, whether in
basketball, softball or darts, brings with it a
profound sense of accomplishment. No one has
done worse. If you are "last," it simply means that
you are best at being pathetic — and in this fast
paced technocratic logjam of existence, sitting back
and striking out seems to have a soothing,
Quaalude-like quality.
People will be overheard to say, "He bites, but
he sure is styling."
"Last" hits hard on the professional level. In
New Orleans, the fans of the Saints wore paper
bags over their heads and declared themselves "the
Aims."
Minnesota Viking fans, frustrated by their team's
3-13 finish, took it out on first-year Viking Coach
Les Steckel, a replacement for the ever-popular
Bud Grant. Bumper stickers that said "Less
Steckel" soon became a prerequisite for every
four-wheeler, bike or skateboard.
Philadelphia fans, who have been blessed with
"non-last" teams, heckle and rant at winning
teams. So to discuss what they would do to a local
