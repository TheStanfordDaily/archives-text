# Who to look for in the 1986 World Cup
## 
### FLAVIO FEFERMAN Editorial staff 
The soccer World Cup which starts Satur
day in Mexico has already broken a trend.
Unlike most World Cups in the past, it has no
clear-cut favorite. Rather, there is a group of
teams which are capable of advancing to the
final rounds of the competition.
But even this group is not very well defined.
The only prediction that can be made with a
degree of certainty is that Latin American
teams will benefit from the conditions in
Mexico. Squads from Brazil. Argentina,
Uruguay and. of course, Mexico are used to
playing at high temperature and altitude. His
tory also seems to be on their side, as no
European country has ever won a World Cup
on this side of the Atlantic.
Furthermore, they will be backed by the
partisan Mexican crowds which appreciate the
creative Latin style of play. If Latin teams can
be compared to the Los Angeles Lakers, most
European teams can be likened to the Boston
Celtics. Europeans play a more physical kick
and-run brand of soccer and rely on longer
passes and speedy strikers. It will be interest
ing to see which style will prevail this time

around.
As Mexican coach Bora Milutinovic told
the Journal of Brazil: "(This World Cup)
lacks a favorite like Brazil in 1970 or West
Germany in 1974. But the winner will be a
team that plays in the South American style,
even if it comes from Europe."
Milutinovic was probably alluding to Italy,
France and Spain, whose Latin origins seem
to translate into the way they play soccer.
Italy was victorious in the 1982 World Cup in

Spain when it defeated the West Germans
and their physical brand of soccer 3-1.
However. France, the European champion in
1984. seems to be the strongest overseas con
tender.
But other European teams will provide
some heat of their own. As usual. West Ger

many is a strong contender. England, Belgium
and especially Denmark should advance from
the first round and may go further.
London bookmakers last month had Brazil
as the I 1-4 favorite, followed by Argentina at
4-1 with Uruguay coming in at 6-1. But these
figures can be deceiving. There are many can
didates but no favorite.
Here's a rundown of each group.
Group A — Puebla and Mexico City.
Argentina is one of the favorites to win the
World Cup. Superstar Diego Maradona. who
plays for Napoli in Italy, is the team's biggest
asset. He is the focal point of the Argentine
offense, and that is precisely the problem.
Opposing teams often provide Maradona with
an extra shadow that follows him wherever he
goes on the field. Sometimes two players will
be on Maradona. Argentina must spread its
offense and take advantage of the double
teams on Maradona.
Jorge-Alberto Valdano — who plays for
Real Madrid and was the second leading
scorer in the Spanish league this year — is just
hitting his peak and will be a handy addition.
Veteran sweeper Daniel Passarela w ill anchor

the defense.
Italy is a team of ups and downs. It played
poorly in the first round of the 1982 World
Cup hut was devastating thereafter. Its per
formances after '82 have been subpar. The
team has changed very little since that year
and if anything the players should be more ex
perienced.
Cabrini and Tardelli are steady defenders,
and winger Bruno Conti adds speed and
creativity up front. Last Cup's leading scorer.
Paolo Rossi, returns at striker, but the
"Bambino d'Oro" (Golden Kid) seems to
have lost his magic and won't be a factor.
Italy should finish second in the group and
may go far if the '82 spark returns.
Bulgaria has a decent team at best after
reinstating two players suspended for fighting
at the Bulgarian championship final. South
Korea will watch the second round on TV.
Group B — Mexico City and Toluca
Playing at home will undoubtedly help
Mexico. The team has been training hard and
improving steadily and it is now considered
one of the favorites. A recent loss to England
should not deflate the morale of the team or

the Mexican fans. Mexico's star is scoring
threat Hugo Sanchez of Real Madrid, who
was the leading scorer in the Spanish league.
As in 1982, Belgium has a strong squad and
plays very well as a team. The main players
are attackers Jan Caulemans and Erwin Van
derbergh, two returnees from 1982.
Paraguay will battle Belgium for second
place in the group. It will rely on its star Julio
Cesar Romero. " Romerito." who played for
the New York Cosmos when he was just 18
and has since become one of the most com
plete players in South America. Romero, who
plays for Fluminense of Brazil, should be
helped by midfielder Nunez and winger
Cabanas.
The World Cup should be a learning exper
ience for rookie team Iraq. Just that.
Group C — Leon and Irapuato
France is the best European squad in the
World Cup. The team is basically the same
one that lost in the semifinals in the last
World Cup on penalty kicks and finished in
third place. France, nevertheless, came back

and won the European championship
in 1984. New players like Luis Fer
nandez have further improved the
team.
France's South American-style
soccer should captivate the Mexican
crowd. The team is led by perhaps the
best midfield in the world, composed
of Fernandez, Jean Tigana, Alain
Giresse and superstar Michel Platini.
Both Hungary and the Soviet Un
ion lost their best players to injury.
The second spot in the group should
hinge on what team can best adapt to
the loss.
If you like to see abundant scoring
be sure not to miss Canada's games.
Lettieri, the goalie, should lose a few
pounds from fetching balls in the net.
Group I) — Guadalajara
Brazil was the favorite to win this
World Cup until injuries weakened
the starting team. Midfielders An
thony Cerezo and Dirceu had to be
cut. Renowned superstar Zico, ar
guably the best player to emerge from
Brazil since Pele, may also miss the
first round due to a nagging knee in
jury.
Nevertheless, Brazil's depth should
still lift it to a championship. And
there are plenty of stars left. The mid

field should be strong with Paulo
Roberto Falcao, crowned the "King
of Rome" when he played for that
team; Junior, the leader of Torino
club team in Italy: and Socrates —
not the philosopher.
Spain is another good team, much
improved from the squad that lost at
home in the first round of the 1982
World Cup. Budding star Butragueno
and Julio Salinas provide a powerful
one-two punch on offense. The mid
field should also be good with Gor
dillo and Gallego, two veterans who
do not want to repeat the failure of
four years ago.
Algeria upset West Germany 2-1 in
the first round of the 1982 Cup and
cannot be taken lightly by Spain or
Brazil. Northern Ireland, a hard
working team, completes the group.
Group E — Quaretaro and Nezahual
coyoti
Group E has been dubbed "El
Grupo de la Morte" (The Group of
Death) and is undoubtedly the tough
est. West Germany is always a con
tender in World Cups and this year is
no different. It has good players in all
sectors of the team. Goalie Schumac
her is one of the best in the world,
and Hans-Peter Briegel should
anchor the defense. Magath will
create plays from the midfield. Lit
tbarski, Voller and superstar Karl-
Heiz Rummenigge add offensive

punch.
Uruguay has also put together a
strong team, blending skill and com
petitiveness. Enzo Francescoli is the
new star on the team and will be an
offensive force.
Another power in the group is
Denmark, which has come out of
nowhere to become one of the best
European teams. The team will be led
by Preben Elkjaer-Larsen.
Scotland is the weaker team in the
group, especially after its veteran star
Kenny Dalglish was lost to injury.
Group F — Monterrey
England and Poland are the
stronger teams in this group. They
have similar styles of play and rely on
speed and strength. They probably
will not go too far after the first
round, though.
The star of the group is Poland's
Zbigniew Boniek, who plays for
Rome. England's Mark Hately is a
prolific scorer.
Portugal is an erratic team but may
surprise the two favorites if its players
decide to end their strike for better
bonus pay.
Morocco is the weakest team in the
group, but it has the distinction of
being better than Canada, which is
slotted as the worst team in the World
Cup by the London bookies at 1,000-
1.
