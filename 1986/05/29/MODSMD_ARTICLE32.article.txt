# Cardinal runners aim for standards

### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Better late than never. That's
what four Stanford track athletes
are hoping will be the case after
tonight's Oregon State invita
tional.
To qualify for the NCAAs, a
runner must better what's known
as a standard. Regardless of how
many races you've won or lost,
you don't go to nationals until the
clock says you've qualified.
Stanford's Ryan Stoll, Pam
Board, Christian Skoog and Brian
Conolly are all national-caliber
runners, but they've yet to beat
the standard. Tonight will be their
last chance to do so.
"Obviously, that's the whole
thing. If I don't qualify, it's a fail
ure. If I do qualify, it's a success,"
Skoog said.
Stoll will run the 5,000 meters;
Board will run the 400 hurdles;
and Conolly and Skoog will join
forces in the 800. By working to
gether, Skoog and Conolly figure
that they'll have a better chance of

beating the clock.
"We've talked. We're probably
going to do half the work each.
One guy takes the first quarter and
the other takes the second,"
Skoog said.
Skoog has been within a mere
. 14 of a second of qualifying, and
Conolly has been down to
1:49.11, which is only a second off
of the NCAA's 1:48.11 standard.
So if they are able to push each
other through, a qualifying time
looks like a reasonable goal.
Board has also been close. Her
season best of 59.19 seconds
leaves her about .7 seconds off the
NCAA's 58.50 standard. If the
competition is there to pace
Board, she could qualify. At this
point neither the athletes nor
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson
are really quite sure who else will
be running at Oregon State.
Stoll, on the other hand, will
have quite a way to go if he is to
qualify. The senior's season-best
time of 14:34.9 is almost 40
seconds off the 13:57.2 time which
he'll have to beat.
