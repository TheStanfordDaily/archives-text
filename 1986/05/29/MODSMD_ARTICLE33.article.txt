U.S. role seen for Chernobyl
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union is prepared to let American doctors
follow up in the treatment and observation of .thousands of people af
fected by the Chernobyl nuclear accident, according to a U.S. physician
involved in the case. - >
Dr. Robert Gale, of the University of California, said in an interview
that Soviet officials have said they are willing to allow the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences and other research organizations to participate in
surveys of the approximately 100,000 people living in the Chernobyl
region and potentially affected by radiation. '
The medical information collected from the sample would be invalua
ble iir determining the causes, and possibly the cures, for cancer, Gale'
said.
"We have to follow these cases. We owe it to these people to give
them the best possible care," he said.
Gale said he had been given the; go-ahead to solicit American partici
pation by Deputy Health Minister Oleg Shchepin, and, in principle, by
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during a meeting earlier this month.
Gale, a bone marrow transplant specialist who is back in the Soviet
Union for a second visit to follow up on the care of patients, said U.S.
doctors and researchers could help in the massive health survey, with
both computerization and patient care.
Progress seen in hostage talks
PARIS — A senior Syrian official said yesterday that the release of
French citizens seized in Beirut was just "a matter of time" following
negotiations involving the kidnappers and the Syrian and Iranian gov
ernments.
The statement by Defense Minister Gen. Mustafa Tlas appeared to
confirm reports here and in the Middle East of a possible breakthrough
in the hostage negotiations. In an interview in Damascus with a French
radio station, Tlas described the release of the French hostages as
"certain" but refused to predict a precise date.
The latest reports about an imminent release of French hostages fol
low a significant improvement in relations between Paris and Tehran
and the visit here last week by the Iranian deputy prime minister, Ali
Reza Moayeri. Islamic groups who are holding a total of nine French
citizens have called on France to moderate its support for Iraq in the 5 1 -
2-year Persian Gulf war with Iran.
Tlas, who has the reputation of being outspoken but not always accu
rate, did not mention the fate of four American citizens who are also
being held in Lebanon. In an interview published May 18, Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad said French President Mitterrand was the leader
"most concerned" about releasing the hostages.
Assad has acknowledged that previous attempts to secure the release
of the French hostages have failed at the last moment In the interview,
he said Syria did not have direct contacts with the splinter groups that
were actually holding the hostages.
The Syrian defense minister said that the liberation of the French
hostages had been delayed as a result of the April 15 attack on Libya by
the United States and what he described as "American pressure on
Syria." Some U.S. officials have accused Damascas of involvement along
with Libya in recent acts of state-sponsored terrorism.
Noting that Assad had personally urged Iranian President Ali
Khamenei to use his influence on behalf of the French hostages, Tlas
told the Europe 1 radio station: "We are convinced and persuaded that
their liberation is just a matter of time."
Contra leaders conclude meeting
Nicaragua's top counterrevolutionaries ended a marathon meeting in
Miami yesterday, altering their alliance to give more power to relative
v moderates led by Arturo Cruz, according to Nicaraguan and U.S.
sources. No major leadership shifts occurred.
The closed-door power contest, which dragged on nearly three weeks,
was the most intensive internal review by the contras since they began as
a 500-rebel cell, recruited by the CIA, more than four years ago.
The summit of the contras, as the Nicaraguan rebels are known, in
cluded economist Cruz, Adolfo Calero, head of the 10,000-guerrilla
Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), and Alfonso Robelo, a Costa
Rica-based businessman. They are the senior directors of the Unified
Nicaraguan Opposition, the contras' broadest umbrella group.
Calero retained his position. He has been widely attacked in recent
months by opponents within the movement who charge he is corrupt,
and pressured by Reagan administration officials who contend he does
not appeal to a broad range of Nicaraguans opposing the leftist Sandi
nista government.
Sources familiar with the discussions said removal of any of the high
est ranking leaders was never seriously considered.
But after protracted wrangling, the leaders adopted new rules pro
posed by Cruz for naming and dismissing guerrilla field commanders,
making decisions among themselves and subordinating all contra organi
zations to their rule, the sources said.
Allies dispute East German move
HALIFAX, Nova Scotia — Foreign ministers of the United States,
Great Britain, France and West Germany met here last night to
devise a strategy to thwart what U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
called an illegal attempt by East Germany to nibble away at allied rights
in Berlin.
The latest dispute, over rules so arcane that even U.S. diplomats
privately refer to them as "Berlin theology," erupted last week when
East Germany announced that it would require diplomats to show pass
ports when crossing from East Berlin to West Berlin through Check
point Charlie or other openings in the Berlin wall.
Although the wall is one of the most formidable frontier barriers in
the world, the Western allies maintain that it has no legal status. Under
the terms of Germany's surrender after World War 11, Berlin was
divided into U.S., British, French and Soviet sectors. Although the So
viet sector was soon converted into East Berlin and the sectors of the
three Western allies into West Berlin, the accords guarantee diplomats
free access to all parts of the city.
Azcona endorses aid to contras
WASHINGTON — Honduran President Jose Azcona promised yes
terday that his country "will not be a launching platform" for attacks
against any of his neighbors, but he endorsed renewed U.S. aid to rebels
fighting the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua.
Continuing a working visit here. Azcona demonstrated the delicate
political balance he is trying to strike in Honduras' relations with its
neighbor. Nicaragua, and its patron, the United States.
Azcona. 57, a relatively W&ak figure when installed in January after
inconclusive elections, has emerged as a firm supporter of U.S. goals in
the region even as he maintains distance from them.
Azcona told editors and reporters of The Washington Post that he
supports President Reagan's request for $100 million in new aid to the
rebels, known as contras, because it is necessary to prevent the estimated
15.000 rebels from "becoming an uncontrollable group"' of bandits
within Honduras if they lose U.S. backing.
Aid might also help the contras "to exercise their right to remove a
government which is not granting the freedoms it promised before com
ing to power," he said.
However, he told the Organization of American States later yesterday
that the contras' presence on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border "causes
constant friction" there, even though "there is no conflict whatsoever
between Honduras and Nicaragua."
