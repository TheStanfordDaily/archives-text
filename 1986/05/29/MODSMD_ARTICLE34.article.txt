# Weinberger hints at defying SALT II
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday that the United
States is "no longer bound" to continue observing
the unratified SALT II strategic arms limitation
treaty following President Reagan's announcement
Tuesday, and other senior U.S. officials described
Reagan's decision as among the most important of
his Administration in the arms-control field.
Hardening the impression left by White House
officials discussing future adherence to the treaty
Tuesday, several officials said the White House an
nouncement went much further in sealing the fate
of SALT II than did a tentative decision on the
same subject in mid-April that was subsequently
discussed with U.S. allies.
The White House announced that the United
States would take two Poseidon submarines out of
service this spring, thus keeping the country under
the SALT II limits for intercontinental ballistic
missiles, but added that in the fall, the United
States would exceed SALT II limits by deploying
new air-launched cruise missiles on B-52 bombers.
It was this latter aspect of the Administration's
newly enunciated policy that officials pointed to

yesterday in emphasizing that the Administration
had made an important new policy decision to no
longer make weapons-deployment decisions on the
basis of SALT 11.
Tuesday's more ambiguous statements had
drawn political criticism from Republicans, includ
ing Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole ( R-Kan.),
who said the decision to dismantle two Poseidons
"sends the wrong signal to the Kremlin." Dole
called for a more explicit renunciation of the un
ratified treaty.
At the same time, some leading Democrats had
praised President Reagan fof Tuesday's statement
on grounds that Reagan was staying within the nu
merical limits of SALT II even while declaring
rhetorically that he would no longer recognize
them as a "standard" for U.S. strategic weapons
deployments.
Among the reasons cited by various officials yes
terday for the new SALT policy was Republican
political pressure on Reagan, a reported failure of
top allied leaders at the Tokyo summit to argue
forcefully for keeping SALT II alive, and a sense on
Reagan's part that it would be better to take

criticism for one big decision on the controversial
SALT II issue now than to deal with it piecemeal
over several months.
Speaking to reporters before delivering the com
mencement address at the U.S. Military Academy
at West Point, N.Y., Weinberger recalled that
Reagan last summer agreed to "go the extra mile
for arms control by continuing temporarily to ob
serve the limits of the SALT II treaty. "The presi
dent has traveled that last mile and we are no
longer bound by that flawed agreement. It's very
simple," Weinberger said.
Senior U.S. arms adviser Paul Nitze said in an in
terview that Weinberger's interpretation is
"correct" but added that Reagan is committed "to
take another look at the matter" if the Soviets
should take the initiative in the next several months
to satisfy U.S. concern on arms issues.
But Washington attorney Paul Warnke, who was
senior negotiator of the SALT II treaty in the
Carter Administration, called Reagan's decision "a
way to achieve the early demise of arms control"
and said it meant that in the Administration, "the
nuts have won" the policy debate.
