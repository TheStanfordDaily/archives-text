# Violence destroys South African town
## 
### 
CROSSROADS, South Africa —
Bulldozers yesterday cleared debris
from a 62-acre wasteland where three
sections of this sprawling squatter
complex outside Cape Town have
been demolished in bitter fighting be
tween black conservative and radical
factions during the past 10 days.
In what local analysts are describ
ing as the bloodiest chapter in nearly
two years of racial violence in South
Africa's black ghettos, 48 persons
have been killed, at least 120 have
been injured seriously and about
35,000 have been left homeless.
The Red Cross and other welfare
organizations have set up refugee
centers in church halls and tent camps
around the devastated shantytown to
accommodate the thousands of
homeless families.

Many have lost everything. In the
smouldering ruins of the squatter
camps, some refugees spent yesterday
scratching at the ground with sticks
looking for meager savings that had
been buried in tins beneath their
shanties.
Civil rights organizations are ac
cusing President Pieter Botha's ad
ministration of taking sides in the
fighting and have compiled a file of
49 sworn affidavits by Crossroads
residents accusing the police of ar
ming and assisting the conservative
faction.
Using these affidavits, they won a
court action against the police Mon
day, when a provincial Supreme
Court judge issued a largely symbolic
order that the police should not
"permit unlawful attacks" on a fourth

section of the Crossroads complex
whose residents say they feel threat
ened.
The affidavits allege that the auth
orities have used a band of vigilantes
to uproot thousands of squatters from
the Crossroads complex whom they
have been trying to remove for years
but have been unable to because of
stubborn resistance and political
protests at home and abroad.
"This is a forced removal of the
worst kind," said the Rev. Allan
Boesak, a leader of the activist
United Democratic Front, as he
toured the devastated areas of Cross
roads yesterday. "Even for the South
African police, this must set a record
in brutality."

sought to drive home the point when
they produced two "captured"
vigilantes at a news conference in
Johannesburg yesterday, one of
whom said he had been paid by the
police to participate in attacks on ac
tivists.
A statement issued by police
headquarters in Pretoria last night
denied the vigilante's allegation.
"The police don't kill people, nor do
they pay people to do this. They try to
restore law and order," the statement
said.
The charge of official connivance
with the Crossroads vigilantes comes
at a time when such accusations are
being made against the Botha admin
istration in many parts of South
Africa.
