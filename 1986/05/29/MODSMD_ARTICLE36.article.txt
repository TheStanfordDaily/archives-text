Spy trial continues
BALTIMORE — Ronald Pelton, the former
National Security Agency employee on trial for
espionage, told an FBI agent that agreeing to spy
for the Soviets was "the biggest mistake in his
life," the agent testified yesterday.
David Faulkner, one of two agents who ar
rested Pelton last November, said that Pelton
added just before his arrest: "But when you're
broke and you're desperate and your family can
barely survive, you do crazy things."
Pelton, 44, faces six counts of espionage. For
merly a $24,500-a-year communications special
ist at NSA, he is charged with selling secrets to
the Soviet Union for $35,000.
Faulkner, a prosecution witness testifying for
the second straight day, provided details on the
five hours on Nov. 24 during which he and spe
cial agent Dudley Hodgson questioned Pelton in
an Annapolis, Md., hotel before arresting him
there about midnight.
Pelton appeared "normal, calm and in com
plete control" during the questioning, Faulkner
testified.
Faulkner, the only witness on the trial's second
day, coolly answered questions posed by Assis
tant U.S. Attorney John Douglass, the lead pros
ecutor, and identified numerous maps and
wiretap tapes that the prosecution says show Pel
ton's trail of spying.
In Washington, the directors of the Central In
telligence Agency and the National Security
Agency last night formally "cautioned" reporters
covering the espionage trial of Pelton "against
speculation and reporting details beyond the in

formation actually released at trial."
The unusual statement from William Casey of
the CIA and Lt. Gen. William Odom of NSA
said "such speculations and additional facts are
not authorized disclosures and may cause sub
stantial harm to the national security."
FBI agents rally
CLEVELAND — In an unusual action, at
least 50 agents from the FBl's Cleveland field of
fice will demonstrate their support at the arraign
ment today in Washington of Robert Friedrick,
the bureau supervisor indicted on charges of
lying about alleged efforts to prevent the indict
ment of Teamsters President Jackie Presser.
"They're coming down on annual leave at their
own expense to show their personal support for
Friedrick, who is a colleague," said William
Baker, assistant FBI director for congressional
and public affairs.
Baker said that FBI headquarters had deter
mined that enough agents would remain on duty
at the Cleveland office "to respond to any situa
tion that may arise. Therefore, we didn't bar any
such move on their part."
He declined to disclose how many agents are
assigned to the Cleveland office, the FBl's 12th
largest, but other sources said that the number is
fewer than 200.
John Dunn, the FBl's spokesman here, said
that the agents were leaving on a bus early this
morning "to lend their personal support" on the
steps of the federal courthouse in Washington.
He said that he did not expect them to enter the

courtroom or carry any placards or signs.
"In no way is this an official FBI activity or
posture," Dunn said. "We are not and cannot ad
dress the merits of the indictment. It's a show of
support for a colleague whom we know and
respect and feel empathy for."
Despite the FBl's effort to underscore the un
official low-key nature of the show of support,
officials at the Department of Justice criticized
the action. "It's dumb, and they're going to be
embarrassed when the facts (about the case)
come out," said one official, who declined to be
identified.
Dow hits record high
NEW YORK — Stock prices surged yesterday,
breaking record highs that had stood for several
weeks as Wall Street's bull market continued its
recent revival.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 25.25 to 1,878.28, easily surpassing the
previous closing peak of 1,855.90 it reached on
April 21. In the last four sessions the average has
gained 103.11 points.
Indexes of the New York and American stock
exchanges and the over-the-counter market also
hit new highs, and trading picked up from its
recent sluggish pace.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 159.59 million shares, up from 121.16
million Tuesday and the heaviest total in more
than a month.

The unusual statement from William Casey of
the CIA and Lt. Gen. William Odom of NSA
said "such speculations and additional facts are
not authorized disclosures and may cause sub
stantial harm to the national security."
FBI agents rally
CLEVELAND — In an unusual action, at
least 50 agents from the FBl's Cleveland field of
fice will demonstrate their support at the arraign
ment today in Washington of Robert Friedrick,
the bureau supervisor indicted on charges of
lying about alleged efforts to prevent the indict
ment of Teamsters President Jackie Presser.
"They're coming down on annual leave at their
own expense to show their personal support for
Friedrick, who is a colleague," said William
Baker, assistant FBI director for congressional
and public affairs.
Baker said that FBI headquarters had deter
mined that enough agents would remain on duty
at the Cleveland office "to respond to any situa
tion that may arise. Therefore, we didn't bar any
such move on their part."
He declined to disclose how many agents are
assigned to the Cleveland office, the FBl's 12th
largest, but other sources said that the number is
fewer than 200.
John Dunn, the FBl's spokesman here, said
that the agents were leaving on a bus early this
morning "to lend their personal support" on the
steps of the federal courthouse in Washington.
He said that he did not expect them to enter the

courtroom or carry any placards or signs.
"In no way is this an official FBI activity or
posture," Dunn said. "We are not and cannot ad
dress the merits of the indictment. It's a show of
support for a colleague whom we know and
respect and feel empathy for."
Despite the FBl's effort to underscore the un
official low-key nature of the show of support,
officials at the Department of Justice criticized
the action. "It's dumb, and they're going to be
embarrassed when the facts (about the case)
come out," said one official, who declined to be
identified.
