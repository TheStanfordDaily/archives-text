Pornography blasted
LOS ANGELES — Citing a report by the U.S.
Attorney General's Commission on Pornogra
phy, California's 26 Catholic bishops issued a
statement yesterday condemning pornography as
"a perverse and sometimes vicious profanation"
of the sacredness of human sexuality and urging
social action against its dissemination.
The statement by the California Catholic bis
hops cited "recent social science studies" that
"document the damaging psychological and so
cial effects of pornography."
Pornography "creates a hunger for more vio
lent, more deviant and more anti-social sexual
materials," the bishops said, "driving many who
use it to engage in increasingly unusal and bizarre
sex acts with a greater variety of partners. Child
molesters, persons who commit incest, killers
and rapists, often develop a fondness for por
nography" and use it to arouse themselves before
seeking out victims, the statement said.
The California bishops added that they support
the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of ex
pression. But they said that they agree with Chief
Justice Warren Burger's opinion in a prominent
1973 case rejecting the notion that hard-core
pornography is protected by the First Amend
ment.
The bishops expressed support for individuals
who bring "community pressure to bear on store

owners," inform police of anti-pornography law
violations, and lobby for zoning restrictions to
ban "pornography stores and theaters" in resi
dential neighborhoods.
Hugh Hefner, editor and publisher of Playboy
magazine, responding to a call by Los Angeles
Archbishop Roger Mahony for pickets and
boycotts of stores selling his magazines and other
sexually explicit publications, said that the Cali
fornia bishops' statement was a return towards
the "religious censorship" of movies the Catholic
Church exercised in the 1930s and a "very, very
clear step towards (establishment of) a theocracy.
Pornography now is defined as anything sexual
that somebody doesn't approve of."
25,000 retirees gather
ANAHEIM — Two months ago, the Ameri
can Association of Retired Persons said, to the
skeptical raised eyebrows of some, that 25,000
people would attend its national convention,
which opened here Tuesday.
It does indeed appear that the estimates were
wrong: 20,000 had shown up by noon Tuesday,
some arriving as early as 7 a.m. despite the fact
that activities did not begin until 9 o'clock. By
7:30 p.m. Tuesday, 23,651 had registered, and
the early prediction surely would be topped by
the time the convention closes Thursday.

Some headed for the association's business
meeting and a keynote address by Shirley Chis
holm, a pungent call to action that brought a
rousing standing ovation for the former New
York congresswoman who is the only black ever
to serve on the influential House Rules Commit
tee.
That was just the beginning of a day that drew
standing-room-only crowds — in rooms that ac
commodate 4,000 — to hear psychologists Ruth
Westheimer and Joyce Brothers. Pulitzer Prize
winning cartoonist Jeff Mac Nelly took a look at
politics and other experts addressed Medicare,
Social Security, pension benefits, health, alterna
tives to nursing homes, wills and estate planning
and the problems of adult children and aging par
ents.
George Burns' show Tuesday evening — as
well as Andy Williams' Wednesday night —were
marked "sold out" on brochures mailed weeks
ago to the association's 22 million members 50 or
older.
Weather Report
Yo, Joe. No need for your temper to be shorter
as you can keep on sporting life as no heavy
weather is expected (not even past 8:30). Highs
in the 80s, lows with Pastorius. The question is
whether the weather will remain together.
