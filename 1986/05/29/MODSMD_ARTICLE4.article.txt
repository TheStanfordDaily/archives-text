# SURFER catches big waves

Homework at a prestigious univer
sity like Stanford takes various shapes
and sizes. While many of us are busy
solving impossible problem sets or
scratching out unruly papers. others
pass their time designing small free
flying satellites.

In January. Prof. Peter Banks of
the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment advertised his E235 space sys
tems design class with recruitment
fliers that read: "Do you want to
build a REAL satellite?" Forty in
trigued students, including three un
dergraduates. enrolled in Banks' two

quarter class and held him to his
word.
"This is the most outstanding
group of students that I ever taught,"
said a proud Banks of his third E235
class at Stanford. Over the course of
the past six months, the students,
guided by advisers and research assis
tants, have designed a hitchhiker
satellite that, with NASA's approval,
will be launched into space aboard a
shuttle in February 1989.
Appropriately dubbed SURFER
(Stanford University Radio Fre
quency Emissions Receiver), this
little satellite will be catching some
big waves in space. After being
ejected from the shuttle's 'getaway
special' cargo bay, SURFER will ex
amine the magnetic and electrical
plasma waves in the atmosphere

around the shuttle. It will also test
how this plasma reacts to an
electronic beam shot from the rear of
the shuttle. Primarily, though, SUR
FER will measure the electrical cur
rents generated by a 12.5 mile-long
wire tether or antenna to be deployed
from the shuttle's roof.
By "advancing our knowledge of
the use of this antenna," explained
Banks, the whole project will be "of
great value and fascination to those
interested in radio science."
"We should give justice to science,
because science is the reason we're all
doing this," said Robert Entriken,
E23s's first student project manager.
One of the class' primary objec
tives was making the satellite small
