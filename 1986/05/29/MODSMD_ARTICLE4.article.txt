# SURFER catches big waves

Homework at a prestigious univer
sity like Stanford takes various shapes
and sizes. While many of us are busy
solving impossible problem sets or
scratching out unruly papers. others
pass their time designing small free
flying satellites.

SE

In January. Prof. Peter Banks of
the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment advertised his E235 space sys
tems design class with recruitment
fliers that read: "Do you want to
build a REAL satellite?" Forty in
trigued students, including three un
dergraduates. enrolled in Banks' two

quarter class and held him to his
word.
"This is the most outstanding
group of students that I ever taught,"
said a proud Banks of his third E235
class at Stanford. Over the course of
the past six months, the students,
guided by advisers and research assis
tants, have designed a hitchhiker
satellite that, with NASA's approval,
will be launched into space aboard a
shuttle in February 1989.
Appropriately dubbed SURFER
(Stanford University Radio Fre
quency Emissions Receiver), this
little satellite will be catching some
big waves in space. After being
ejected from the shuttle's 'getaway
special' cargo bay, SURFER will ex
amine the magnetic and electrical
plasma waves in the atmosphere

around the shuttle. It will also test
how this plasma reacts to an
electronic beam shot from the rear of
the shuttle. Primarily, though, SUR
FER will measure the electrical cur
rents generated by a 12.5 mile-long
wire tether or antenna to be deployed
from the shuttle's roof.
By "advancing our knowledge of
the use of this antenna," explained
Banks, the whole project will be "of
great value and fascination to those
interested in radio science."
"We should give justice to science,
because science is the reason we're all
doing this," said Robert Entriken,
E23s's first student project manager.
One of the class' primary objec
tives was making the satellite small
dynamics, and how they all add up to
reach a goal in a group project,"
Aguero added.
Although the class is guided by re
search assistants and advisers, "We
can safely say that the design is all
done by the students." Illustrating the
adviser-student relationship,
Entriken drew a picture of a
precipitous ledge. "They (the ad
visers) will stand behind you and grab
you as you're about to fall off the
edge of the cliff, but they'll let you
walk all the way up to the edge first,"
he said.

and inexpensive. The students have
been able to accomplish this by using
low-cost parts to construct SURFER,
which will weigh only 150poundsand
measure 15 inches in length and 17
inches at its widest cross-section.
SURFER's status as a 'hitchhiker'
satellite is a reflection of its small size,
low cost and independent origins.
Once aboard the shuttle, SURFER
can be best described as a "chartered
hitchhiker," according to Vic
Aguero, the second of the class' se
quential student project managers.
"NASA gives it a ride up (to space)
but that's it," explained Aquero.
The class itself is divided into seven
specialized teams, each concentrating
on a certain phase of the satellite's
planning. Each team has a leader and
all the teams are coordinated by a
student project manager. In order to
share responsibility, the class is
divided into trimesters with all the
student leaders changing each
trimester through an election process.
In the course information packet,
Banks informed his students that
"one of the important educational
objectives of the class is to show how
technical compromise is an essential
for any space systems design activ
ity." This compromise has been one
of the most difficult obstacles to
overcome for the student designers,
according to Entriken.
"Trying to get everyone to agree
on something and live with it and
move on has been a real milestone ,"
said Entriken of the 40-person coor
dination effort.
"It's a lot of learning about inter
personal relations and group

In addition to the preliminary
design and feasibility testing of SUR
FER, Banks' students are also re
sponsible for locating sponsors for the
space project, which is expected to
cost about $300,000 dollars. Al
though NASA will provide cargo
space free of charge for Stanford's
satellite and the design and construc
tion of SURFER will be handled
voluntarily by the students, money is
needed to provide salaries for the re
search assistants and leaders who will
devote considerable amounts of time
to the project.
Entriken and Aguero both agreed

that the commercial world's response
to their small-size, low-budget
satellite was "very promising" and
emphasized the generous support of
industry, not only in funding but in
technical advice as well.
"In the next few weeks, people in
the class will be calling up experts in
industry and the University and ex
plaining to them very specific designs
and getting their comments on them.
We will have much better designs as a
result of these preliminary discus
sions," Entriken said.
On June 3, the class will present

"We want NASA to approve us and
accept us as a real thing. That is our
first objective."

their payload accommodations re
quirements, safety requirements and
preliminary design plan to NASA and
approximately 100 invited sponsors,
contacts and researchers.
"We want NASA to approve us
and accept us as a real thing. That is
our first objective," Entriken said.
With NASA's approval, the class
will continue to polish SURFER's
design throughout the summer and if
all goes well, construction will begin
as early as this October. All 40 stu
dents have worked long and hard,
and now "they are ready to present it
to the world," Banks said.
