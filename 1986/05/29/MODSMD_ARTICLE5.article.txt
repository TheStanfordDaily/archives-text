# Subcommittee drafts guidelines for theme houses
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
Saying Stanford will continue to
support ethnic theme houses on
campus, a University subcommittee
has drafted a proposal that would
weigh commitment to a given theme
more heavily than ethnicity in assign
ing students to those residences.
The Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising (SREA) ap
proved a proposal Friday that "puts
the ethnic priority as a lower priority
than commitment to the theme," ac
cording to Biology Prof. Craig Heller,
director of the program in Human Bi
ology and chair of SREA.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies tenatively approved the pro
posal yesterday, he said.
"We're not abandoning ethnic
priority, but putting it below commit
ment to the theme," Heller said.
The document is also significant in
that it "states unequivocally that the
University is solidly behind ethnic
theme houses," Heller said.
Heller noted that in the past,
charges have been made to the effect
that the University wants to do away
with theme housing. The document
should "quell that concern," he said.
Currently, the first 50 percent of
the spaces in ethnic theme houses are
filled by those students with number
one priorities — returning residents
who claim ethnicity, and number two
priorities — ethnicity only, according
Damian Carmichael. a student mem
ber of the committee.
Under the new guidelines, students
of any ethnicity can get a priority by
committing to the program. Carmich
ael said.
"We want to broaden the opportu
nity of non-ethnic students to get into
the (theme) houses." he said.
The proposal would maintain the
50 percent ethnicity in the house, but
the committee members "believe that
will happen without recognizing eth
nicity," Carmichael said.
But if 50 percent of the available
spaces fill with students not of the
ethnicity on which the theme focuses,
"an ethnicity criterion may be used to
fill the remaining spaces," the draft
states.
The 50 percent figure is the
"critical mass" that is essential to

providing a multicultural atmosphere
to a theme house, Heller said.
According to Heller, priority re
quirements will be drawn up by the
respective houses and will be submit
ted to the Office of Residential Edu
cation for approval. Such priorities
will be made for both academic and
ethnic theme houses.
The subcommittee's proposal will
fill the void of guidelines on the sub
ject of theme houses. Heller said.
"Now (the system) is ad hoc," Hel
ler said, adding "there is no proce
dure for evaluation and no procedure
for continuation. . . . Theme houses
have grown willy nilly," he said.
There will be an open meeting at
Casa Zapata tomorrow at 4 p.m. to
discuss the proposal and to "get
reactions," Heller said.
Proposals for new theme houses
must be submitted before Jan. 15 to
be considered for the following fall
quarter.
"If proposals for continuing aca
demic theme houses and proposals
for new academic and ethnic theme
houses create a demand which cannot
be met by existing facilities, SREA
will be responsible for ranking those
proposals and deciding which ones
will be implemented," the document
states.
Changes in the current theme
houses could be seen as early as next
spring. Heller said.
According to Heller, the proposal
has "no provision for ethnic theme
houses not filling."
"The essential function of ethnic
theme houses is to support that ethnic
community," and therefore have
"more lenient criteria" for filling
compared to academic theme houses.
Heller said.
The document states that "if an
ethnic theme house establishes a con
sistent record of not being able to fill
its available spaces for upperclassmen
with students seeking priority assign
ment, the Office of Residential Edu
cation should arrange for an ad hoc
committee a to review the program of
that house and recommend ways to
make it stronger and more attractive
to students."
If an ethnic theme house does not
fill, "it will be reassigned to a smaller
facility," Heller said.
According to Carmichael, it is pos
sible that an ethnic theme house pro
gram could be terminated, "but un
der these guidelines it is highly
unlikely."
With an academic theme house,
"lack of interest is a clear signal" that
the house should not exist. Heller
said.
The document specifies that
"demand for academic theme houses
will be assessed on the basis of the
numbers of students requesting
priority assignment."
An academic theme house will be
terminated if it "fails to fill 90 percent
of its assignable space with students
requesting priority assignment" after
Round 11 of the Draw for two succes
sive years, or if it "fails in any single
year to fill 75 percent of assignable
spaces with students requesting
priority" after Round 11, the docu
ment states.
The criteria for maintaining aca
demic theme houses is strict because
"there is a lot of competition for aca
demic themes," according to Audrey
Bernfield, director of the Undergrad
uate Advising Center and ex-officio
member of the committee.
According to Heller, the proposal
could come before the Faculty Senate
in the fall.
In addition to Carmichael and Hel
ler, SREA members include three
students, three faculty, and one staff
member, along with several ex-officio
members from the administration.
