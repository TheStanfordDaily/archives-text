Arguing that the federal budget deficit must be
reduced by reducing taxes. Senate hopeful Arthur Laf
fer said here yesterday that he believes in structuring
financial rewards to make private interests coincide
with the public good.
"If you beat a dog. you know where the dog won't
be, but you don't know where he will be," said Laffer,
an economics professor at Pepperdine University. "If

you feed a dog, you know where he will he." In the
same manner, "If you have a high tax rate, you know
that people won't report income, and you won't know
where they got it."
If you have low taxes, according to Laffer, you can
encourage people to engage in productive behavior
since it is in their best interest to do so.
Laffer. a Stanford graduate, made his stop here
while campaigning for the Republican nomination for
the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Alan Cranston.
The GOP primary will be held Tuesday.
A member of President Reagan's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers. Laffer is credited with originating the
so-called Laffer curve, which asserts that high tax rates
actually decrease total governmental revenue because

of disincentive effects.
Speaking to a crowd of about 70 people in Cubber
ley Auditorium, Latter advocated his particular philos
ophy of tax structures and incentive effects.
Laffer advocates a simple system of two flat taxes —
one on all of a business' added value, another on per
sonal unadjusted gross income. He estimates that such
a tax structure could reduce the marginal personal
income tax rate to about 11.5 percent.
Laffer extended his idea of providing economic in
centives to a variety of issues, such as education, con
servation and terrorism.
He advocated the voucher system proposed by econ
omist Milton Friedman, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, which would allow parents of children in
private schools to recoup some amount of the taxes
they pay to support public schools.
In a more unusual vein, Laffer advanced the idea of
direct awards for academic excellence. Laffer il
lustrated this idea by proposing, for example, that
people who scored in the top 5 percent of the Scholas
tic Aptitude Test be given $15,000 tax-free, those in
the next 5 percent be given $7,000, and so on.
Laffer introduced his ideas about encouraging con
servation by remarking, "Thank God that there are
people like Jane Goodall who will go live with the
chimps for years, and thank God it's not me."
According to Laffer, "if you want to save something,
make it valuable."' He pointed out that if 20 years ago
the government had paid a bounty of several thousand
dollars for hatching a live California condor chick, the
skies might be full of condors today — a situation he
suggested might result in "condor cacciatore."
In response to a question about terrorism. Laffer
asked. "What do you want from a terrorist? Nothing!
Only that he not terrorize. You want to make terrorism

unattractive."
Laffer said the recent bombing raid
on Libya may have helped to make

terrorism unattractive to Libya's
leader Col. Moammar Khadafy, but
that it was accomplished at a very
great cost.
A more economical alternative,
Laffer suggested, might be to offer a
million dollar reward for information
leading to the arrest and capture of
suspected terrorists. If such a reward
were offered, Laffer surmised, "95
percent of Libya would be trying to
find Khadafy."
Laffer is currently ranked near the
bottom of the eight-candidate GOP
field, behind front-runners Rep. Ed
Zschau of Los Altos and Los Angeles
media commentator Bruce Hershen
son.
