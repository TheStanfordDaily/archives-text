# Bookstore sells Pravda translation
## 
### HUGH R. BETHELL Staff writer 
Kremlinologists of all English-speaking
countries, unite! A daily translation of Pravda,
newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union, is available now at the Stanford Bookstore.
According to the Bookstore's John Seib. the
store has already sold two subscriptions of the
translated newspaper to members of the Stanford
community. To make more people aware that the
Pravda translation is available to them, the
Bookstore is also distributing fliers on campus ad
vertising the new periodical.
Seib said he expects the general student body to
be interested in the paper, whose Russian name
means "truth," as well as those students involved in
international and Soviet studies.
"The popularity of Russian TV seems to indicate
a real interest in Soviet life," Seib said, referring to
a television receiving station here used to monitor
Soviet news coverage of international events, most
recently the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant in the Ukraine.
In addition to the Bookstore, the English version
of Pravda is also available at the Hoover Institu
tion. loe Dwyer, deputy curator of the East

European Collection at the Hoover Library, said
both the translated and original versions are
available as reference materials in the basement of
the Hoover Tower.
By inter-library agreement, Dwyer said Hoover
alone subscribes to the newspapers of concern to
foreign study, so the paper will not be available at
other libraries on campus.
The English version of Pravda is made available
to the Bookstore by Associate Publishers of St.
Paul, Minn. According to Bill Abersh, sales agent
for the company, providing a translation of a Soviet
newspaper on a regular basis began as a wild idea.
But, "we asked around, and there turned out to be
a lot of interest from corporations, government
offices, libraries and universities." he said.
Associate Publishers started publishing its trans
lation on the first of this year, Abersh said. The
process begins with an original copy, which is
translated by a group of scholars, typeset to
resemble the original Pravda form, and mailed di
rectly to subscribers like the Bookstore.
"Originally, it was going to be for subscribers
only, but when word got out about our efforts, a lot
of newstands and bookstores wanted to carry it for
sale," he said.

Still, the process of preparing an English version
of Pravda is not without its problems. Because of
the enormous work involved in working with a
daily paper from a very foreign culture. Abersh
said the Russian-English translators are suffering
from a time lag of almost three months. Conse
quently, the most recent issue available at the
Bookstore is from March.
Abersh predicts, however, that the backlog will
be conquered by the end of this summer, and from
then on issues will be immediately translated and
mailed.
One exception has been made, however. Abersh
said that because of tremendous demand, the May
5 issue, with coverage of Chernobyl, was sent out
ahead of schedule as a special issue. The publishers
wanted subscribers to be able to read news of the
event just as the Soviet people did, he said.
But a disaster like Chernobyl does not necessar
ily receive substantial coverage in Pravda. Abersh
noted that only two stories appeared about the
accident, with the paper as a whole remaining at its
average length of about six pages. As a general
rule, Pravda prints a larger issue on Monday,
usually of eight or 10 pages, roughly corresponding
to a Sunday edition in the United States.
