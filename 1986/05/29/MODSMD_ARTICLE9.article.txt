# Med students secure more internships

### KELLY SUND Staff writer 
In a marked increase from years
past, 66 percent of the students
graduating from the Stanford Medical
School next month who sought in
ternships have received their first in
ternship choice.
Another 19 percent were accepted
into their second or third choice.
Only three members of the graduat
ing class chose to go directly into re
search.
The acceptance figures are sub
stantially higher than those from the
last five years, when an average of 53

percent of Stanford graduates were
accepted into their first choice intern
ship program.
"It's been sort of a steady rise over
the last five years," said Dr. Roy
Maffly, associate dean of Student Af
fairs for the Medical School.
Maffly said that the high number of
students getting into their first three
choices might have been a result of
students applying to less competitive
programs, but he said he did not think
that was the case with the Stanford
students.
Out of the 72 percent interning at
university medical centers, 21 percent
of the students will stay at Stanford,

17 percent will go to University of
California system schools and 3 per
cent will go to Harvard.
Placement into internship pro
grams involves a matching process, in
which students rank their choices for
internships and the internship pro
grams rank the students they would
like to accept. The two sets of lists are
then compiled, with the goal of get
ting students into one of their first
three choices.
Although in recent years the in
creased number of graduating stu
dents may have decreased a student's
chance of getting into the internship
program of his choice, Maffly said he

believed only certain specialities —
such as ophthalmology and anes
thesiology — have shown an in
creased number of applicants, making
it more difficult to get an internship in
those fields.
The most popular internship pro
gram among Stanford students was
internal medicine, chosen by 50 per
cent. Sixteen percent have accepted
surgery internships, and 10 percent
chose obstetrics and gynecology. The
number of students choosing emer
gency medicine internships rose, with
5 percent going into such programs,
while family practice programs fell in
popularity, attracting 3 percent of
those accepting internships.
