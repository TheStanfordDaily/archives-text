# Profs, ask all faculty to support divestment
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
A group of 14 Stanford professors
plan to send letters to 2,000 faculty
members this week urging them to
call upon the University Board of
Trustees to divest from stock in com
panies that do business in South
Africa.
The scholars are asking faculty
members to sign copies of the pro
divestment statement, which will be
presented to the trustees before their
June 13 meeting.
The scholars state in the letter that
"partial divestment is a poor policy.
What is at issue in South Africa is
citizenship, political rights, freedom
and equality.
"Foreign investment, by its very
nature, supports white rule. Compa
nies cannot operate successfully at
odds with the fundamental premise of
the current political order. . . . Stan
ford must sever its ties with apart
heid."
The University must undergo "a
complete and orderly divestment,
phased over a reasonable but limited
time, to minimize transaction and
other costs to encourage affected
companies to cease operations in
South Africa," the scholars state in
the letter.
According to Joel Samoff, associ
ate professor of education, the letter
will "provide the faculty with a way to
express their concern" over Univer
sity investment policy.
"There is a general sense among
some faculty that there are more
people on the faculty who are un
happy" about the policy, he said.
The faculty is beginning to come
together about the issue of divest
ment, he said, adding the letter will
allow professors to become "a bit
more focused" and organized."
Samoff said that some faculty
members urging divestment will join
student activists in a protest demon
stration at Stanford's June 15 Com
mencement. He said, however, that
the protest would be "non
disruptive" and would be similar to
last year's action with graduates car
rying black balloons.
The trustees, who have followed a
long-standing policy of selective di
vestment from companies that do
business with South Africa's apart
heid regime, earlier this month voted
to sell shares of Newmont Mining, the
board's first such move.
Stanford currently owns shares of
South Africa-related stock valued at
$ 182 million.
The board's Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility had earlier rec
ommended the board divest its
$400,000 worth of shares in Dia
mond Shamrock Petroleum and $3.5
million in Schlumberger as well as the
$9,900 worth of Newmont Mining
holdings. The trustees suspended ac
tion against Shamrock pending the
company's promise to dispose its
South African interests.
St. Claire Drake, a professor
emeritus in anthropology and sociol
ogy, said yesterday that some of the
scholars involved were encouraged to
protest the board's decision by the ac
tions of Statistics Prof. Charles Stein,
the only Stanford professor to be ar
rested last year during student anti
apartheid protests.
"Stein has gone a long way in his
solidarity with (student protesters),"
Drake said. "I think this whole action
is to show our support."
Most of the 14 scholars were in
volved in circulating a shorter letter
last week condemning as an "insult"
the trustees' decision to divest only
$9,900 of the University's South
Africa-related holdings.
In that letter, the group described
that trustees' action as "callous, un
feeling (and] deliberately
provocative," pointing out that the
amount represents only "one-ten
thousandth of the stockholdings of
this University in companies doing
business in South Africa."
