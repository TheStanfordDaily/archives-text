Senate, Republican: Ed Zschau

The Republican race, originally a seven candidate
free-for-all, has narrowed in recent weeks to a two
man race. According to the latest polls, two-term 12th
district Rep. Ed Zschau holds a narrow lead over tele
vision pundit Bruce Herschensohn. Zschau, a
moderate, is a much more appealing candidate than
the ultra-conservative Herschensohn.
Herschensohn, a commentator for a Los Angeles
station, has said he favors aid to the contra rebels and
will do whatever necessary "to achieve victory." He
asserts that the U.S. strike on Libya last month was not
tough enough. Herschensohn would not compromise
on military spending. In addition, he has said he would
refuse to sign any agreement with the Soviet Union on
arms control if the U.S. would be forced to give up

12th Congressional district,
Democrat: No recommendation

Republican Congressman Ed Zschau's Senate bid
this year has spawned a seven-candidate scramble to
fill his newly vacated 12th Congressional District seat.
Since the 19605, the 12th District, which includes
Stanford, has consistently sent Republican candidates
to Congress. And judging from the marked weakness
of all three of the Democratic candidates in Tuesday's
primary, a Republican is likely to win this November as
well.
Sean McCarthy, Lance Weil and write-in candidate
Mel Emerich offer voters very little in the way of either

On the Republican side, competition has been

San Jose Asst. Police Chief Stan Horton has accum

largest police force. He is by far the most qualified can

Sheriff s Sgt. Armand Tiano, a veteran of 15 years,
lacks Horton's depth of experience. The incumbent,
Robert Winter, has a weak record. As the county's
chief police officer, Winter oversees the Stanford
police force, which came under fire for its handling of
the Old Union sit-ins last October.
Under Winter, allegations of Stanford police mis

constitutional amendment banning abortion.
Zschau, a former Stanford professor who has
represented this area since 1982, opposes constitu

need to alleviate poverty. Write-in Emerich, a Los Altos
attorney, has said that cuts in military spending can
free much needed funds for more pressing needs, such
as improving public education, assuring clean water
and cleaning up toxic waste.
The Democratic party appears to have given up on

shows much promise or originality. No recommenda

ranged from the rough treatment of students at Big
Game two years ago, to the harassment of minorities
on campus, to the use of pain-compliance holds on stu

Additionally, the sexist overtones of a campaign ad
vertisment featuring Winter hovering over a young,
handcuffed woman have justifiably angered many.
It is time for a change. The Daily recommends a vote
for Horton.
