Scholars advocate
alternate gift fund
We are three Stanford students
who this year received Rhodes schol
arships to study at Oxford. Stanford
has given us an outstanding education
and has provided us with unique op
portunities for learning that will di
rectly affect our future. By contribu
ting to the Stanford Centennial
fund-raising campaign, alumni can
further strengthen the programs and
facilities from which we and others
have benefited so much. There are,
indeed, many good reasons to give to
Stanford.
There is, however, one compelling
reason not to give to Stanford, or at
least not yet. The educational
benefits which we enjoy have
profound costs for others. Like the
Rhodes Trust, Stanford's endowment
is invested in dozens of corporations
that do business in South Africa.
These corporations support a vicious
system which denies the majority of
its population — the blacks of South
Africa — the right to vote, to associ
ate freely, to move and to possess the
land that is rightfully theirs. The
wealth of the white minority depends
on the exploitation of blacks who are
forced into an existence of destitu
tion, malnutrition and grossly inade
quate health care and education.
Both the Rhodes Trust and Stan
ford's endowment can be invested
more responsibly throught the efforts
of those who benefit from them.
American Rhodes scholars are
working to have the Rhodes Trust
divested from corporations doing
business in South Africa, and Stan
ford students have likewise worked to
change Stanford's investment
portfolio.
However, after years of student
protests calling for Stanford to divest
totally from these corporations, and
after false promises by the Stanford
Board of Trustees to pursue a policy
of selective divestment, the board
recently decided to divest a meager
$9,900 from its total of approxi
mately $182 million invested in com
panies doing business in a country
ruled by apartheid. Whatever the in
tentions of these companies, they all
support apartheid by paying millions
of dollars in taxes each year to the
South African government. Many of
them support the system in much

more direct ways.
Not only does the board's inaction
actively support apartheid and insult
concerned students and faculty, but it
rejects the pleas for divestment from
more than three-quarters of the black
population in South Africa, as
reiterated by Bishop Desmond Tutu
here on our campus this year. The
education Stanford students enjoy
continues needlessly to have an inti
mate relationship with the oppression
of others.
Though we encourage alumni to
contribute to Stanford, we would like
them to be able to give to a better,
more socially responsible university.
To make this possible, we have estab
lished through the ASSU a non
profit, South Africa-free trust for
gifts to a better Stanford. These con
tributions will be released to the Uni
versity when it divests totally from
corporations doing business in South
Africa or when the black majority
there has the political power to deter
mine its future, whichever comes
first.
If, after 10 years, neither of these
conditions is satisfied, the fund will be
donated to charitable relief for blacks
in South Africa. We hope that those
who agree with our position, espe
cially graduating seniors, will contrib
ute generously to the Free South
Africa Fund. If you would like to
make tax deductible contributions to
the fund, please contact us or the
ASSU.
In the spring of next year, when in
dependent, non-profit status has been
attained, the fund will be transferred
to a legal trust overseen by a board
including the following people: Keith
Archuleta, Office of Residential Edu
cation; St. Clair Drake, professor
emeritus of anthropology; Laurie
Edelstein, class of '86: James Lowell
Gibbs, Jr.. professor of anthropology;
William Gould, professor of law;
Ronald Rebholz, professor of En
glish; and ourselves.
We hope that there will be signifi
cant change both at Stanford and in
South Africa long before 1996. The
sooner such change comes, the more
gladly and generously many of us will
give to Stanford in its second century.

Recent divestiture
just a first step
After 10 years of debate on the
University investment policy with
regard to South Africa, the Stanford
Board of Trustees at its May meeting
made the first decision to divest from
a company operating in South Africa.
Although the amount, $9,900, is
insignificant in comparison to Stan
ford's $182 million South Africa
related portfolio, it is important as an
initial step in the direction of a so
cially responsible investment policy.
The efforts by the Stanford com
munity to support the people of
South Africa in their struggle for
freedom are making a difference. The
appeal of the South Africans and
their leaders for international eco
nomic sanctions against the racist
apartheid regime clearly places a
moral obligation on Stanford to
reconsider its current policy of invest
ing in companies operating under
apartheid. Total divestment is the
most effective action that the Univer
sity can take, but it will require the
community to speak out strongly
before the trustees will follow this
course.
The shanties built by concerned
students symbolize the plight of the
South Africans and their efforts to
survive together as families and com
munities. The Quad shanties were
built to keep the issue of South Africa
before the eyes of the administration
around the board meeting.
In accordance with previously an
nounced intentions, Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) made a deci
sion to take down these shanties on
Friday, May 23. The materials from
the shanties will be made available to
other groups planning to build their
own shanties and SOS A members
will be glad to help.
Please join us in our efforts to raise
community awareness of the historic
struggle in South Africa and the need
and opportunity for Stanford to make
a constructive contribution.
