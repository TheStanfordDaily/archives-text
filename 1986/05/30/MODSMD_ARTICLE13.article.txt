# Liberals must resist Reagan onslaught
## 
### 
During this decade, the public image of liberals
has steadily declined. They have been seen as pes
simists and doves: soft on defense, weak and ir
resolute. "Peace" is fast on its way to becoming a
derogatory term — in some contexts it is suspected
of denoting communist sympathies.
The Democrats' response to their decaying
image is to drift toward a more conservative stance
on defense and foreign affairs. They want to change
from "doves" to "lean hawks."

It's possible that some could see the Democrats'
political shift as the result of a more realistic assess
ment of the threats to U.S. national security. It
isn't. It's political expediency — the tough guys get
the votes nowadays.
One reason they get votes is that Reagan-style
conservatism is a foreign policy that is far easier to
sell to the general public than is the liberal policy.
Of course, conservatives have a great advantage
over liberals: they have President Reagan. No mat
ter what the situation, he has a tried and true strat
egy for success. Cut taxes, buy defense, use force
and then turn around and say "Problem? What
problem? God bless you and good night."
But the issue for liberals is much more funda
mental than this, and they can't blame their
popular decline on Reagan.
In the post-Vietnam era, liberals have tradition
ally been the spokespeople for restraint in foreign
policy. But with the memory of Vietnam fading.

Americans have become impatient with restraint.
For many, restraint does not mean prudence, but
instead means, "We're not No. 1!"
A non-interventionist foreign policy simply isn't
splashy. The American public really doesn't notice
when the government doesn't do something or
avoids getting involved in something unpleasant.
The public notices raids on Tripoli.
It seems as if Democrats have become the nay
sayers in foreign policy. "No to the MX missile,
"no" to contra aid, "no, no, no." The challenge for
liberals is to begin saying what they're for, instead
of what they're against. I can't speak for all liberals,
but I can say, as one liberal, what I'm for.
I'm for a recognition of the limits on U.S. power
abroad. The United States has used its power ever
since the end of World War II to contain commu
nism. The intellectual basis for this has been the
domino theory. If the United States doesn't show
its commitment to the freedom of one country,
what makes U.S. policy makers think the Soviets
will respect a commitment to a more important
country?
The Soviet Union can gradually erode U.S. poli
tical commitments abroad until the United States
finds itself surrounded by hostile communist na
tions. In the abstract, this theory actually makes a
lot of sense. But one very important factor is left
out: that of the gobbled-up countries themselves.
Don t they have anything to say in all of this?
Client states simply aren't what they used to be
in the good old days. They can be uncooperative,
bossy and even disloyal. The list of former Soviet
allies and client-states that have broken relations
with the Soviet Union is long: Zaire, Ghana, In
donesia, China. Egypt. India. . .. And the Soviets
are not exactly having the time of their lives in Af
ghanistan.
The lesson to be learned by U.S. policy makers is
that the world isn't divided up into pro-Soviet and
pro-U.S. countries. The United States would do

well to recognize and adjust to complex global
changes, even when those changes mean a decline
in U.S. power in favor of increased regional
autonomy. Then the United States could shape its
policy around this new realism, instead of rolling
back imaginary communist threats to our national
security.
I'm also for an intelligent defense policy. This
means advances in arms control: negotiating a ban
on nuclear testing, preserving outer space for
peaceful purposes and negotiating reductions in of
fensive nuclear arms.
This is not a knee-jerk policy of "less is better."
It includes provisions for modernization — but
modernization that would enhance deterrence
rather than undermine it.

Liberals are not a bunch
of woolly headed
idealists. . .

Liberals are not a bunch of woolly headed
idealists. Their approach to foreign policy may be
more pacifistic than that of most conservatives, but
that doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. And the fact
that a majority of the U.S. population doesn't back
it certainly doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. It just
means that it isn't popular.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to stand up for
what you believe in if it means you lose votes.
I only hope that the United States wakes up to
the fact that it can't throw its weight around the
way it did 40 years ago. Maybe then liberalism will
be something more people can be proud of— not
something to try to cover up.

domino theory. If the United States doesn't show
its commitment to the freedom of one country,
what makes U.S. policy makers think the Soviets
will respect a commitment to a more important
country?
The Soviet Union can gradually erode U.S. poli
tical commitments abroad until the United States
finds itself surrounded by hostile communist na
tions. In the abstract, this theory actually makes a
lot of sense. But one very important factor is left
out: that of the gobbled-up countries themselves.
Don t they have anything to say in all of this?
Client states simply aren't what they used to be
in the good old days. They can be uncooperative,
bossy and even disloyal. The list of former Soviet
allies and client-states that have broken relations
with the Soviet Union is long: Zaire, Ghana, In
donesia, China. Egypt. India. . .. And the Soviets
are not exactly having the time of their lives in Af
ghanistan.
The lesson to be learned by U.S. policy makers is
that the world isn't divided up into pro-Soviet and
pro-U.S. countries. The United States would do

well to recognize and adjust to complex global
changes, even when those changes mean a decline
in U.S. power in favor of increased regional
autonomy. Then the United States could shape its
policy around this new realism, instead of rolling
back imaginary communist threats to our national
security.
I'm also for an intelligent defense policy. This
means advances in arms control: negotiating a ban
on nuclear testing, preserving outer space for
peaceful purposes and negotiating reductions in of

This is not a knee-jerk policy of "less is better."
It includes provisions for modernization — but
modernization that would enhance deterrence
rather than undermine it.

Liberals are not a bunch of woolly headed
idealists. Their approach to foreign policy may be
more pacifistic than that of most conservatives, but
that doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. And the fact
that a majority of the U.S. population doesn't back
it certainly doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. It just
means that it isn't popular.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to stand up for
what you believe in if it means you lose votes.
I only hope that the United States wakes up to
the fact that it can't throw its weight around the
way it did 40 years ago. Maybe then liberalism will
be something more people can be proud of— not
something to try to cover up.

During this decade, the public image of liberals
has steadily declined. They have been seen as pes
simists and doves: soft on defense, weak and ir
resolute. "Peace" is fast on its way to becoming a
derogatory term — in some contexts it is suspected
of denoting communist sympathies.
The Democrats' response to their decaying
image is to drift toward a more conservative stance
on defense and foreign affairs. They want to change
from "doves" to "lean hawks."

It's possible that some could see the Democrats'
political shift as the result of a more realistic assess
ment of the threats to U.S. national security. It
isn't. It's political expediency — the tough guys get
the votes nowadays.
One reason they get votes is that Reagan-style
conservatism is a foreign policy that is far easier to
sell to the general public than is the liberal policy.
Of course, conservatives have a great advantage
over liberals: they have President Reagan. No mat
ter what the situation, he has a tried and true strat
egy for success. Cut taxes, buy defense, use force
and then turn around and say "Problem? What
problem? God bless you and good night."
But the issue for liberals is much more funda
mental than this, and they can't blame their
popular decline on Reagan.
In the post-Vietnam era, liberals have tradition
ally been the spokespeople for restraint in foreign
policy. But with the memory of Vietnam fading.

Americans have become impatient with restraint.
For many, restraint does not mean prudence, but
instead means, "We're not No. 1!"
A non-interventionist foreign policy simply isn't
splashy. The American public really doesn't notice
when the government doesn't do something or
avoids getting involved in something unpleasant.
The public notices raids on Tripoli.
It seems as if Democrats have become the nay
sayers in foreign policy. "No to the MX missile,
"no" to contra aid, "no, no, no." The challenge for
liberals is to begin saying what they're for, instead
of what they're against. I can't speak for all liberals,
but I can say, as one liberal, what I'm for.
I'm for a recognition of the limits on U.S. power
abroad. The United States has used its power ever
since the end of World War II to contain commu
nism. The intellectual basis for this has been the
domino theory. If the United States doesn't show
its commitment to the freedom of one country,
what makes U.S. policy makers think the Soviets
will respect a commitment to a more important
