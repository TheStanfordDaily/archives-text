# Forum discusses funding process
## 
### JOHN POLLACK Staff writer 
"There's an art to applying for funding
... it (just) takes time to learn it," former
Chairman of the ASSU Appropriations
Committee Jim DeLaHunt said last night.
This is the problem a forum on ASSU
funding practices and procedures sought to
address last night in Tresidder Oak Lounge
East.
According to ASSU Senator Jeff Sloan,
the forum was designed to allow student
groups to voice their opinions on the ASSU
funding process, and thus make it "more
user-friendly."
According to Victor Huang, recently ap
pointed to the new position of budget coun
selor, student groups "view the Program
Board as an adversary."
Huang said he plans to work with student
groups on their funding requests before they
submit them to the Program Board. He

added that he can help student groups
"clean up the proposals ... so that in the
end they won't come up against any
surprises (when they submit them to the
board)."
As budget counselor, Huang said he
hopes to the whole (funding) process
go smoother." - v v
While he acknowledged that he Will not
be able to help all groups, Huang said he will
"try and get (to) the ones that need the most
work."
Responding to the criticism that the
ASSU funding process is unnecessarily com
plex, DeLaHunt said the procedure is the
price paid for maintaining democracy in the
allocation of funds to studentjroups.
Currently, to receive funding, student
groups must first submit a proposal to the
ASSU Program Board. After approval by
the board, funding proposals must pass
through the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee and then the ASSU Senate at large.

Without this "multi-tiered" system, there
would be less input from student elected of
ficials, DeLaHunt said.
According to Eric Berg, former chairman
of the ASSU Appropriations Committee,
the need for a budget counselor arose from
the ineffectiveness of the office of Student
Organizational Services (SOS). SOS "hasn't
done its job in the counseling area." he said.
However, Michael Ramsey-Perez,
representing SOS, disagreed, saying that
SOS does offer such counseling to student
groups "in a variety of ways."
. Eric Diesel, financial adviser to several
student groups on campus, said that many of
the problems with student groups' proposals
stemmed from their last-minute prepara
tion.
But Eugene Chen, former director of the
Program Board, said he hoped word of the
board's "new standards" would discourage
this, and added that counseling will play an
important role in this.
