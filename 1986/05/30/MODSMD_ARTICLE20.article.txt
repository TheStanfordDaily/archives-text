# Do grad students exist?
## 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
This week's quest for the caffeinated,
NutraSweet essence of that ever-bubbly
brew, student life, takes us to the wilds of the
Coffee House, one of the secluded habitats
of the rare, speckled grad student, cogito
ergo si lid in m.
Field workers camouflaged as chess
players in the smoking section of this rich,
mountain-grown wilderness report that al
though University statisticians claim there
are 6,555 members in Stanford's grad stu
dent colony — a population rivaling that of
the common, well-rounded undergrad,
cogito ergo s lee pit u in, 6,524 members strong
— few specimens could be tagged.

Each time my assistant Jim and I
(Wouldn't you get a Marlon Perkins complex
about now?) tried to tranquilize a likely case
— I mean, long scraggly hair and everything
— it would turn into a senior still hanging
around, waiting for investment bankers to
throw it a cost-efficient curve of a job offer.
The EPA is even getting concerned;
they're issuing a new, endangered species
bumper sticker — "Save the Grad Student."
I don't know, I'm pretty skeptical about
whether grad students ever existed, never
having encountered a real one, only co
terms, which are actually cousins to the un
dergrad that just adopt grad student coloring
during June to avoid their matriculation

migration.
I've heard some convincing theories about
higher beings from outer space infiltrating
our universities to impart their wisdom to us
in the form of TAs. At least that explains
why some section leaders have such
impossible accents; you cant expect Mar
tians to speak perfect English.
Then there's the tooth fairy fable which
credits the elusive grad student with the
grading of all undergraduate academic en
deavors, claiming to have proof of incidents
when problem sets and papers were returned
under pillows during the night.
Grad student detractors claim to have seen
shadowy forms swimming in the depths of
Lake Lag and attribute the clumsiness of
many windsurfing students to their mischief,
terming them Lag Ness Monsters.
Proponents of grad student rights charac
terize them as good little gnomes that wash
beakers and transcribe experimental data for
the research papers that win professors ten
ure.
I'm still not sure. Grad students are like
Halley's Comet to me; we don't go in the
same circles, so I've just never witnessed
one.
I have an admittedly narrow image of the
ideal grad student's appearance and behav
ior, starting from the feet up.
In winter, proper footwear includes any
type of socks as long as they're black and a
sufficiently decomposed pair of clunky grey
running shoes, with reflector stripes for night
safety of course. Warmer weather brings the
white tube socks and slimy mudpie
Birkenstocks out of hibernation.
The grad student ankle is recognizable
from the protector clip that encircles its
brown corduroy pant leg.
All this gear helps propel the grad stu
dent's bike, a rusty leftover from when those
granny bikes with the bells were first
popular. You can tell one is approaching by
the jangling, reggae-like beat of the loose
fenders and worn brakes.
White-helmeted grad students always ride
bikes to better chase Domino's delivery men,
who have been known to donate a meatball
or two in particularly pitiful cases of pep
peroni withdrawal.
Maybe if we all joined together today at an
appointed time and intoned, "I do believe in
grad students, I do," the Tinkerbell effect
would ensure their continued existence. Just
maybe.
