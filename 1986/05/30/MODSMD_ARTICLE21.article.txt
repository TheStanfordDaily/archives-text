In this article we address the physical concept velocity.
Before proceding, we offer up a summary of our findings from
previous Friday articles that began appearing in this paper on
May 2, 1986.
1. By recognizing velocity could be given as the geometric
statement, v = nDi, we were able to derive a new energy
equation, E = mc7rDf/0 (May 2nd) and later rewrite this
equation as, E = p 7tDV6 (May 23rd). We proposed this
second form energy equation represented a unified field
equation.
2. Applying the new energy equation, we were able to predict
a ground state electron orbital momentum precisely in
agreement with observation. We proposed this electron
orbital momentum value had been incorrectly divided into
effective mass and effective velocity components. In place
of the current accepted split (accepted electron mass
= 9.1 x 10" 28 g, accepted electron orbital velocity
= 2.2 x 10 8 cm/sec), the electron mass was proposed to
be 1/136 the current accepted value (proposed mass
= 6.67 x 10" 30 g) and the electron velocity was proposed to
be 136 times greater than the current accepted value
(proposed velocity = 3.0 x 10 10 cm/sec), a value identical
to the velocity of light, i.e. the electron was said to be a
photon traveling in orbit.
3. We found a neutron's effective mass could be explained by
two photons in an orbit twice the proton orbit with each
photon located 180Â° out of phase with the other. A model
that not only allowed for cancellation of the wave patterns
each generated (cancellation of charge), but also resulted
in the photons having a separation distance of
.84 x lO H3 cm. This separation distance, which we
defined as the limiting approach distance of two photons,
matched closely with experimental data aimed at measur
ing the proton diameter by directing other atomic particles
at it (May 9th).
4. The equation demonstrated how photons would exhibit
zero effective mass in flat spacetime where the term 6
went to infinity demanding the term for effective mass
(m/ 0) to similarly go to zero (May 2nd). More precisely, the
term mc/ 0 goes to zero.
5. The equation's force counterpart, F = mcf/0 or F = pf/0
demonstrated causality for an inverse square law (May
16th). By substituting, actual orbit divided by minimum or
bit for 6, we could have gone further to show:
F _ mcf mc * min. orbit * 112
actual orbit/min. orbit actual orbit

F = QL = -E.
a. \
The force exhibited by a photon is equal to its energy
divided by its wavelength.
6. The equation was shown to be consistent with the law of
conservation of angular momentum (May 9th and May
23rd).
7. The equation and theory were consistent with frequency
gains in light when falling in a gravitational field (May 23rd).
8. While not discussed, thought that which could be easily
discerned, the equation and theory provided an explana
tion for stable electron orbits. A photon moving in a circle is
moving in circular spacetime. An orbiting electron, which
was stated to be a photon, was thus moving by the prin
ciples of general relativity, in a straight line in circular
spacetime. Since the electron moved in a straight line, it
was not undergoing acceleration and, therefore, did not
create a field disturbance.
Possible never in scientific history has a proposed change in
our foundational laws of physics had so much
demonstratable support at its inception. Still in the tradition of
the past, the author expects the existing palace guard, those
myopically faithful to quantum mechanics, will battle to block
its entry. While the traditionalists can slow the ushering in the
new theory, they cannot prevent it. There will, in time, be a
changing of the palace guard.
We now turn our attention to velocity:
In traveling at a constant velocity in a circle, the rate change
in momentum of a body is constant. This constant momen
tum change is directional change per unit time. Consider a
solid, flat disc or wheel that is spinning. For an observer on
the wheel all other points on the wheel appear motionless.
The position of these other points relative to the wheel riding
observer never change. If two observers are on a spinning
wheel in space, one near the center and one near the outside
edge, these observers could throw a ball back and forth be
tween them and each would say the ball travels in a straight
line whose distance is given by their separation.
The picture is entirely different for a third observer not on the
wheel. To the third observer, the person near the outside of
the wheel is moving much faster than the person close to
center. In observing the game of catch, the third observer
sees the ball leaving the person near center travel a curved
path on the way to the person near the outer edge. It is as if

the center placed person threw a perfect curve so that the
ball once released constantly changed direction at the neces
sary rate to exactly compensate for the motion of the person
revolving near the otuside edge of the wheel. When the
outside person makes a return throw, the third observer wit
nesses another curve ball that curves in the opposite direc
tion.
We say the observers on the spinning wheel are in the same
spacetime. If each had a clock, then no matter how fast the
wheel was spinning, each would agree on the passage of
time. For instance, how long it took the ball to travel back and
forth between them.
Let us now split the spacetime wheel into two bands, an inner
band that contains our inside observer, and an outer band
that contains our outside observer. By application of a force
we slow the outer band rotation rate. The two observers,
which we shall make men, now detect motion relative to each
other. While the inside observeer has not experienced a
change in his rate change in momentum, the outside obser
ver has had his rate change in momentum slowed. The
outside man is now on a different spacetime wheel. We could
have said that in order to move from one spacetime wheel to
another a force is required or similarly, a body's spacetime is
changed when a force is supplied.
When these two men stand next to each other on earth, each
is in the same spacetime or on the same spacetime wheel.
However, if one goes in motion relative to the other by appli
cation of a force, they are no longer in similar spacetimes and
no longer agree on events. The man who received a force,
changed his spacetime when he went in motion. When the
moving man stops (a force must be applied to stop), he
reverts to his original spacetime and the two men again agree
on all events.
As previously stated, when on the same spacetime wheel,
two people, no matter where on the wheel they are, do not
detect motion of the other. Spacetime differences represent
differences in the rate of change of momentum of points on
one spacetime wheel to points on a second spacetime wheel,
or differences in spacetime curvatures. We record these dif
ferences as motion, but for the universe, it might be said, all
points are stationary in different spacetimes. Electrons,
protons and neutrons are statements of spacetime curvature,
i.e., statements of the rate change in momentum existing in
very small portions of spacetime.
One might discern a similarity in that which is said above with
that which was said in an earlier time by the mathematician
William Clifford. "We may conceive our space to have
everywhere a nearly uniform curvature, but that slight varia
tions of curvature may occur from point to point, and them
selves vary with time. These variations of the curvature with
time may produce effects which we not unnaturally attribute
to physical causes independent of the geometry of space.
We might even go so far as to assign to this variation of the
curvature of space 'what really happens to the phenomenon
which we term the motion of matter.'"
