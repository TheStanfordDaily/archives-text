## Tokyo makes a new home in downtown Palo Alto 
### PATRICK JAY, STEVE ONG ED DUNN Tokyo 448 University Ave. Palo Alto 325-1605 
Where do you go if you want the fine traditional
Japanese cuisine ... the kind served in Tokyo? Tokyo, of
course. The restaurant Tokyo in Palo Alto offers good
Japanese food and is most likely the best restaurant,
Japanese or not, that we have been to in the Stanford area
for its price range.
We walked in off the busy University Avenue on a Sat
urday evening into another world.. A small restaurant,
Tokyo highlights the peace and serenity of the Japanese
culture. Every detail — the art on the walls, the music, the
furniture in the restaurant, the host's and waitresses' out
fits, right down to the sake cups —- reflected the Japanese
ability to make one feel comfortable when the world
outside is crowded and noisy.
Ryuju Hosaka, the co-owner with his wife Takako, is a
most hospitable and amiable man. He explained to us that
the restaurant is new on the block, having opened eight
months ago — an amazingly short period of time for a res
taurant to develop such a unique personality. He also
added that the restaurant was planning to serve vegetarian
entrees.
Needless to say, a restaurant does not get by on atmos
phere alone. Food matters too. The delicacy and exquisite
tastes of the dishes and appetizers served complement the
restaurant's decor. Starting with the appetizers, we or
dered a plate of nigiri sushi ($7.80), a combination plate
of different types of sushi including ebi (shrimp), unagi
(fried eel), maguro (tuna), awabi (abalone) and others.
The sushi was fresh, exciting and a good value.
From there we proceeded to the dinner. With each din
ner came miso soup, a light bean paste, green onion soup

and a salad garnished with carrots and radishes and cov
ered with sesame oil dressing. The soup and salad were es
pecially light, and we we»e loying life.
We were now ready for the main course. Four entrees
were ordered: tonkatsu ($8), tempura and beef teriyaki
($12.25), tempura and salmon teriyaki ($12.25) and
gyoza and sashimi ($ 12.30).
The tonkatsu consisted of strips of chicken fried in a
light batter. It was served with vegetables delicately
cooked, keeping its texture. Tender, taut and tasty was the
tonkatsu. Try it.
The tempura, a plate of yams, asparagus, broccoli and
shrimp fried in a delicate light batter, and the beef
teriyaki, fried marinated strips of steak, comprised a very
hearty Japanese dish. The cooks skillfully sealed the juices
and tastes in the tempura without the oily texture we
usually fear and loathe in fried foods. The beef was
cooked medium-rare with a touch of soy sauce and had a
barbecued taste to it. Simply stated, tempura and beef
teriyaki will please lovers of this dish.
The gyoza, reminiscent of Chinese pot stickers, and sas
himi, a raw tuna dish, did not excite us as much as the
other dishes. The gyoza tasted like good pot stickers, but
no more. Anyone who has never tried raw fish before will
be pleasantly surprised by sashimi. We thought that on
this occasion the sashimi was a little bland, but overall sas
himi and raw fish are underrated.
Finally, our favorite entree was the tempura and salmon
teriyaki. The salmon teriyaki seemed to melt in our
mouths sending us into the heights of ecstacy. Fish is gen
erally a hard dish to prepare, usually flat and tough, yet
the salmon teriyaki was anything but that. The dish simply
defies description; one must try it to understand it.
After you have frayed your nerves from one too many
chemistry problem sets, we highly recommend that you
treat yourself to delicious Japanese cuisine in a soothing
atmosphere found at Tokyo. We rate this restaurant a
four out of a four-star rating.
