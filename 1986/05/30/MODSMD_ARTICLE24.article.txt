### Atul Gawande, John Wallin Telford Work 
This week's ratings are in famous
goodbyes, because this is our last
column of the year (sniff sob).
Peter Gabriel — "So"
"Keep your feet in the ground and
keep reaching for the stars."
"Keep your feet in the ground and
keep reaching for the stars."
"Keep your feet in the ground and
keep reaching for the stars."
"Keep your feet in the ground and
keep reaching for the stars."
Following the example of his last
album, "Security," Peter Gabriel
chose to name his latest album. "So'
has a markedly different sound from
"Security" and his previous three al
bums. Here he works through some
different styles — from the pop funk
sound of the current hit

"Sledgehammer," the more
"Security"-like songs "That Voice
Again" and "Mercy Street," to the
overtly African-influenced "In Your
Eyes," and his Kate Bush duet
"Don't Give Up" (why does it
remind us of a Kenny Rogers/Dolly
Parton duet?).
Peter must be getting old because
he is sounding much wiser. His lyrics
are as emotional and driving as on
previous albums, but are more simply
constructed. The real difference,
however, lies in the character of the
songs.
His earlier work, especially on
"Security," built incredible emotion
until you had a sense that Gabriel was
screaming with urgency. As on the
last album, Gabriel builds his songs
around a strong, tribal rhythm that
can give tremendous power, but he
fails to build the same emotion of
songs like "Biko," "I Don't Remem

ber" or even "Shock the Monkey."
"Sledgehammer" may be consid
ered a decent pop song but has little
of the power of previous work, and
"Big Time" is hardly even a good pop
song. Other songs are remarkably
good, especially "Mercy Street" and
"That Voice Again," but do not
capture the intensity they could.
It is difficult to listen to "So" with
out the memory of Gabriel's past
work, but the album is far and away
better than most new music coming
out right now. It is no classic, but it is
a very good album.
Belinda Carlisle — "Belinda"
"We love ya, see ya here on the
'Feud!' "
"We love ya, see ya here on the
'Feud!' "
There are some things that you just
never appreciate until you don't have
them anymore. Your mom doing
your laundry. The last chocolate
frosted donut. The brakes in your car.
The Go-Go's.
Nostalgia for the Go-Go's? Hard
to believe, isn't it? But maybe not.
With solo album No. 2 from Go-
Go's-in-exile (actually, it's Nos. 2 and
3, since Charlotte Caffey, the
guitarist/best songwriter from the
aforementioned has a picture almost
as big as Belinda's on the inner
sleeve), you just can't help but pine
away for the early 1980s.
In the good ol' days of Go-Go past,
Belinda's unsteady, high-pitched lead
vocals were always counterbalanced
with even more unsteady and high
pitched backing vocals, and also by
just plain unsteady drumming and in
strumentation. The lyrics were not
exactly deep, either. But it was always
okay, because we knew that all the
Go-Go's wanted us to do was dance
along with the bouncin' beat and have
some fun. The word "quirky" some
how comes to mind.
On her solo album, however, Car
lisle doesn't want to be quirky. The
songs on "Belinda" (only one of

which she even co-wrote) are trying
awfully hard to be part of the
Sade/Whitney Houston - overpro
duced - strings - tinkly - piano - adult
contemporary conspiracy which is out
to own the hearts and souls of inno
cent Americans trapped in rush hour
traffic.
Belinda's over-tremoloed singing
flubs it though, making them more
side-splitting than heart-rending. The
three or four songs here which
hearken back to Go-Go Land with
turbo-synths and la-la-la vocals serve
only to make you mad that the whole
album didn't sound like that.
This album is distinctive only in
that it manages to squander the tal
ents of innumerable high-energy
popsters: In addition to Carlisle and
Caffey, Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles,
Lindsay Buckingham, Andy Taylor
and co-Go-Go Jane Wiedlin are all
wasted. It's really a drag that Belinda
has abandoned her valley-girl-punk
style to become another KYUU fem
bot. She's much too hip for that.

The Cure — "Standing on a Beach:
The Singles"
"And that's the way it is."
"And that's the way it is."
"And that's the way it is."
"And that's the way it is."
"And that's the ..."

We have a confession to make. We
didn't always used to be as cool as we
are now. No, really. We know this is
hard to take, but this is our last
column of the year, and a little
honesty is in order. You ask: when
did we become cool? Why, when we
started listening to The Cure, of
course.
There was a time in our distant pre
cool past when we'd hear lead singer
-Robert Smith's insistent wailings
about death 'n' junk, and we just
wished he'd shut the heck up. And
then there were all those unorthodox
rhythms and parsimonious melodies.
For the precool, it was too much.
But fortunately, we all get older

and wiser, and learn to love stuff like
broccoli and network news and The
Cure. This here singles collection is
an excellent introduction for the un
cool and a great retrospective for the
cool.
You get to hear The Cure grow and
change and still be terrific. In their
early singles like "Killing an Arab"
and "Boys Don't Cry," The Cure
consisted solely of guitar, driving bass
and drumlines, and Smith's voice. It
all made for an eerily hollow sound,
and, save for the vocals, might easily
be mistaken for a different band than
the one on side two, where The Cure
takes a New Orderesque turn for the
pop.
Side two begins with 1982's "Let's
Go to Bed" (which the band appears
determined to make into a hit: a
sticker on the album reads, "featuring
the new single . . ."), which opens the
era where The Cure lets synths in full
time to provide weird-sounding riffs

and sound effects to fill out their
music.
In addition to the new sounds, the
overall mood has shifted from the
gloomy to the quasi-optimistic, and
the content of the lyrics from the poli
tical to the interpersonal. If you don't
pay attention, you might think that
songs like "The Love Cats" and
"Close to Me" are about love. In fact,
they probably are, but the band's big
fans would insist that Smith et al.
were only being facetious. Love
indeed!
In any case, if you're like we are
now, you'll appreciate having this to
enjoy (for only eight bucks) the entire
space of Curiecity. If you're like we
used to be, you need this album in a
big way, before it's too late. Hurry!
Operators are standing by!
