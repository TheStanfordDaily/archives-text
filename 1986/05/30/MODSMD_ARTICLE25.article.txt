# Shakespeare and Fletcher's 'Two Kinsmen' plays at Nitery
## 
### MARK TOMPKINS Staff writer 
Shakespeare's comedies are well
known for their festive conclusions,
wherein just about all the characters
onstage find themselves being paired
off to get married. The stagelights
dim to the sound of wedding bells
tolling merrily away in the distance.
Not so in the Bard's great
tragedies, of course. There the fall of
the curtain may well be accompanied
by the grim sound of funeral bells.
But what of "The Two Noble
Kinsmen," by William Shakespeare
and John Fletcher? This play is al
most schizophrenic in the way it veers
from broad farce to dark tragedy and
back again.
Currently running in Stanford's
Nitery theatre, the tragicomedy of
"The Two Noble Kinsmen" is no
great Shakesperian classic. Sup
posedly written in 1613, the play is a
collaboration between Willie the
Shakes and Fletcher, Shakespeare's
chief successor in the acting company
of the King's men.
The consensus among most critics
is that Shakespeare began the work
and made some important contribu
tions later on, but that Fletcher was
responsible for the play's overall de
velopment. These critics may be
covering the Bard's reputation, for
"The Two Noble Kinsmen" is not
without flaws. It is padded with a
drawn-out subplot, which while being
amusing, is only incidentally con
nected to the central drama of the
storyline.
That central drama uses Geoffrey
Chaucer's "The Knight's Tale" from
"The Canterbury Tales" as its start
ing point. The cousins Arcite and
Palamon (played in Stanford's pro
duction by Michael Weis and lan
Cummings), both nephews to the
King of Thebes, are held captive in
the court of the Athenian duke

Theseus (Rudolph Lohmeyer). There
they both fall helplessly in love with
the fair Emilia (Alison Mockett),
sister-in-law to Theseus.
The deep-rooted friendship be
tween the two cousins turns to bitter
rivalry for the love of Emilia. Arcite
is banished from Athens by Theseus,
but he returns and disguises himself
as a skilled athlete to impress his love.
Palamon can do little but stew in his
cell, until he is set free by the jailer's
daughter (Shannon Jackson), who is
wildly infatuated with him.
It is the jailer's daughter who pro
vides "The Two Noble Kinsmen"
with most of its humor. She fantasizes
about Palamon, who scarcely notices
her. But her father (Hank Sartin)
wants her to marry a reliable country
bumpkin (Peter Morgan). The jailer's
daughter becomes a low-rent Ophelia
played for laughs. Her unrequited
love for Palamon drives her crazy, in
a scene which brings the play into the
realm of low comedy.
Basically, "The Two Noble
Kinsmen" is a seriocomic look at the
friendships between men and men,

between women and women, and
how these conflict with the love be
tween men and women. Arcite and
Palamon are torn apart by their
loyalty to each other and their pas
sion for Emilia. Meanwhile Emilia
and Theseus's wife, Hippolyta
(Allaire Paterson), worry that
Theseus loves his wife too little,
preferring instead the companionship
of his friend Pirithous (Charlie
Cosovich).
Director Jarrett Walker has opted
for a less-is-more approach regarding
the look and feel of this production.
Tasteful restraint is the guiding prin
ciple here, both in Irene Turner's
subdued lighting design and in John
Wilson's set, which consists of a stone
platform and an illustrated curtain
surrounding the stage.
All this is appropriate for the
Nitery's small scale, as it focuses
more attention on the actors. The
only distracting element of the pro
duction is the electronic music
composed by Gary Rosenberg, which
warbles away between scenes to no
great impact.
In its second half, "The Two Noble

Kinsmen" jumps back and forth be
tween farce and tragedy; the plot in
volving the jailer's lovestruck
daughter barely overlaps with the
drama of Arcite and Palamon. This
could be a bumpy, dislocating experi
ence, but fortunately the actors estab
lish a tone right at the start of each
scene, so that the audience is able to
remain in the play's flow.
Director Walker has been espe
cially adept at putting engaging actors
in the comic roles. Notable is Andres
Mera, for his deft handling of the
doctor who attempts to cure the
jailer's daughter of her madness, with
some rather unconventional methods.
Morgan is sufficiently ludicrous as
the country dullard who woos the
jailer's daughter, while Sartin is won
derfully comic as the doddering old
jailer; he displays all crusty man
nerisms and bewildered expressions.
Jackson is to be commended for
her nervy performance as the jailer's
daughter, an utter fool for love. She
plays her role on the edge of hysteria,
always biting her nails and storming
about for humorous effect. But while

she's high on energy, she also gets
somewhat repetitive. By the end of
the play's first act, we see one too
many scenes which are merely a
showcase for the mania of the jailer's
daughter. I don't know whether
Shakespeare or Fletcher is to blame,
but some judicious cutting here
would greatly benefit the play.
On the dramatic side, the versatile
Weis and Cummings are a fine pair as
Arcite and Palamon. As the highly
emotional Palamon, Cummings is
frantic, always moving at double
speed, always looking for something
to get worked up about. His handling
of the role makes one wonder if
Palamon doesn't have a subtle in
feriority complex to his cousin.
Weis is less over-wrought as
Arcite; he seems more in control,
more confident. This self-assurance
makes sense in the role, since fortune
smiles down on Arcite far more than
on Palamon.
The members of Theseus's court
bring an appropriate dignity to their
parts. Hippolyta is played by Pater
son with a kind of decorous reserve.

Paterson suggests a natural kindliness
underneath her aristocratic manner
and the heavy gold trappings of
royalty.
Mockett does quite well as Emilia,
a more expressive woman than Hip
polyta. For this part a graceful femi
ninity is needed, to make it believable
that Arcite and Palamon would un
hesitatingly fall for her. and Mockett
does the job nicely. In the play's som
ber later scenes, she manages to con
vey a sense of sadness and of being
distraught without resorting to the
yawn-enforcing cliches of hair
pulling, sobbing uncontrollably or
shrieking her lungs out.
Making little impression here is
Cosovich as Pirithous, friend to
Theseus. It's mostly the script's fault.
We're told early on that Pirithous is a
great pal to Theseus, but we never see
much camaraderie between them.
Pirithous is given short shrift in his
scenes, and stands around in the
background most of the time, looking
uncertain.
Fortunately, any vacuum that
might have arisen in the royal entou
rage is filled by Lohmeyer as the duke
Theseus. He gives Theseus a straight
forward, confident manner, suggest
ing that Theseus has been surrounded
by power all his life, and is comforta
ble in his position. Lohmeyer's com
manding voice also comes in handy
for the final scene, when he reflects
solemnly on the tragic outcome of
events.
"The Two Noble Kinsmen" may be
a modest piece of material, consider
ing whose name is attached to it, but
under the auspices of director Walker
in the Nitery, it receives an interest
ing and enjoyable treatment. As if
that weren't enough to recommend it,
the play also features a very well
staged knife fight and wrestling
match. How often do you get to see
that, especially in an intellectually
respectable context?
