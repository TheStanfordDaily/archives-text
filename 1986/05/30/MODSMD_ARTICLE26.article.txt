My Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from
England spins together an entire
socio-political milieu; it's about
Pakistanis in modern South London,
who work in a variety of tawdry
businesses — some legitimate, some
not. The world we see is divided into
the enterprising, entrepreneurial
Pakistanis and the white, racist
street punks, aimless casualties of
Thatchers economic policies. All of
the characters spend much time dis
cussing their politics, but they're
never just pushing around a series of
position papers — they grab onto
their beliefs and turn them into
designs for living. Director Stephen
Frears and writer Hanif Kureishi do
their characters full justice; they
create the sense of a whole commu
nity living and thriving off the South
London decay, and each aspect they
reveal is a surprising discovery.
Larger issues grow out of the char
acters' sexual, financial and political
motivations, but Frears and
Kureishi keep the mixture light and
frothy, and they don't pass harsh
judgments. It's a wonderfully ex
uberant movie, with a terrific group
of performers: Gordon Warnecke,
Daniel Day Lewis, Saeed Jaffrey,
Roshan Seth, Rita Wolf, Shirley
Anne Field and Derrick Blanche.
Plays this week with "The
Makioka Sisters."
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical comedy
made an immediate connection with
young audiences, and it has never
lost it, even though the broad revue
style is dated now and the jangling

editing and Nichols' insistent use of
close-up were always an aesthetic
assault. The major drawback to the
Calder Willingham/Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, un
subtle attack on the bourgeois
values of the older generation — is,
ironically, probably what keeps it
popular. On the other hand, some of
the dialogue has stayed remarkably
fresh, and there are three highly
commendable performances: a full
scale one by Anne Bancroft as em
bittered, overpoweringly seductive
Mrs. Robinson, an imaginative
comic one by Dustin Hoffman as the
confused hero, Benjamin Braddock,
and a small, generally ignored one
by Katharine Ross as Bancroft's
daughter, Elaine, whom Benjamin
courts. Less impressive work is done
by Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robin
son, William Daniels as Mr. Brad
dock and Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs.
Braddock. (No wonder the older
generation gets roasted in this
picture, represented as it is by three
of the least attractive, least

believable actors in the business.)
Richard Dreyfuss shows up in a bit
at the rooming house (run by Nor
man Fell). The songs, for anyone
who has resided in a cave for the last
19 years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday night.
Prizzi's Honor (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses
and triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic finagling. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception; the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age, but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two

main characters — hitpeople Char
ley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and
Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey
as Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Anjelica Huston
(John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat,
Maerose (she's Charley's former
fiance, and she's out to get him).
With Robert Loggia and John Ran
dolph.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest."
Bananas(l97l)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey

Rose). Much of it takes place in a
banana republic where Woody is
fighting for the revolution; there is
also a screwball courtroom sequence
in the second half that is a classic.
Louise Lasser co-stars as a woman
whose every action seems to be a
parody of something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. The direction and
photography are clumsy beyond the
telling, but most of the time you're
too helpless with laughter to notice.
Plays Thursday with "Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex."
Top Gun (1986)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
It's tough to decide which is the
more impressive machine — the
fighter jets that carom across the
wide screen in Dolby stereo, or the
movie itself, which is a superbly
crafted missile targeting the box
office. This picture is nothing more
than a string of terrific commercials
for the armed forces (with a Coca-

Cola ad volleyball game and a Cal
vin Klein ad love scene thrown in),
and it's the kind of "socko' enter
tainment production executives
have dreams about. The screenplay,
by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.,
might have been phoned in, and
director Tony Scott, who began his
career making television commer
cials, is certainly the man for the
job. Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy
fighter jock who gets the girl (Kelly
McGillis), loses his best friend,
grows as a person, etc., etc. I he
aerial combat scenes are very im
pressive, and it's literally impossible
to tell when the models take over for
the real jets. There are two good
jokes associated with this produc
tion: Jerry Bruckheimer and Don
Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop"
and now this, still insist that they are
risk-takers, who "don't follow
trends"; and the U.S. Navy actually
got paid more than $ l million for all
this fantastic publicity.
Plays this week.
The Makioka Sisters (1983)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
Kon Ichikawa directed and co
wrote (with Shinya Hidaka) this
adaptation of Junichiro Tanizaki's
novel, and Ichikawa engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost
miraculous. Both novel and film are
an elegy to the changing lives of four
sisters who've established their
family name and fortune in Osaka
on the eve of Japan's involvement in
World War 11. Ichikawa's version
may be the epitome of what is called
"seamless" moviemaking; we follow

the characters and watch their
relationships develop and incidents
come together without recognizing
any big climactic moments, yet the
entire movie has an emotional flow
that carries us along and ties the
events together. The film is like a
walk down a beautiful Japanese gar
den path — you don't anticipate
what's coming, you just take in the
wealth of patterns and colors, and
you may be surprised by an unex
pected perspective or juxtaposition
of design. The actresses who play
the four sisters give the most subtle,
delicately varied performances
you're likely to see this or any other
year; they are Keiko Kishi, Yoshiko
Sakuma, Sayuri Yoshinaga and
Yuko Kotegawa. The husbands of
the two eldest daughters are played
by Koji Ishizaka and Juzo Itami, and
the unreally perfect, shimmering
photography is by Kiyoshi
Hasegawa.
Plays this week with " My Beauti
ful Laundrette."
The Conformist (1971)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Leaves fly ferociously into the
camera as if possessed; tiny, rat-like
dogs overrun an invalid's bed; a bu
reaucrat sits, Magritte-like, at an
immense marble desk placed
squarely in the center of an immense
office. Bernardo Bertolucci's film of
the Alberto Moravia novel, set in
Italy in the late 19305, is so imagisti
cally rich that you grow delirious
while you watch. Intellectually, the
treatment of fascism as unresolved
homosexual tension may not be sat

isfying, but visually and emotionally
this is a great movie, made by a true
poet-director. The cast is extraordi
nary, too; Jean-Louis Trintignant as
the fascist, Stefania Sandrelli as his
silly, endearing wife, and
Dominique Sanda as the other
woman.
Plays Tuesday with "The
Stranger."
White Nights (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script is poorly written
hokum, the direction is merely com
petent and the movie wastes
Gregory Hines in a dour, ill
conceived role that only allows for
his super-aggressive, jangly style of
tap dancing ("tap improvography,"
which affords few of the pleasures
we get from the wonderfully
relaxed, fluid tap dancing of Gene
Kelly and Fred Astaire). But Mik
hail Baryshnikov, who opens the
movie explosively with a perfor
mance of Roland Petit's "Le Jeune
Homme et la Mort," triumphs, both
in his dancing and in his acting.
Director Taylor Hackford and
screenwriters James Goldman and
Eric Hughes allow Baryshnikov to
display the wizardry he's celebrated
for — a dozen or more pirouettes,
backward jelees on points — as well
as the wit and boundless physical
imagination that characterize his
work on stage. He gives a supremely
confident performance — a star turn
— and he holds the movie together.
With Helen Mirren, Isabella Rossel
lini, Jerzy Skolimowski and
Geraldine Page.
Plays Saturday with "Runaway
Train."

Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this movie
contains the best five minutes
Woody Allen has ever done: the
sketch in which he plays a sperm
being prepared for launching. (Tony
Randall and Burt Reynolds are at
the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor
who falls in love with a sheep named
Daisy. The first skit, with Allen as
an unfunny jester and Anthony
Quayle and Lynn Redgrave as the
king and queen, begins promisingly
but declines quickly when Allen gets
his hand caught in Redgrave's chas
tity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci
fi take-off about a giant breast
(silly), a quiz show called "What's
My Perversion?" (pretty bad) and a
quarter-of-an-hour with Lou Jacobi
as a transvestite (hopeless).
Plays Thursday with "Bananas."
Turtle Diary (1986)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows
more affection for novelist Russell
Hoban's epigrammatic characters
than he has for anyone in his movies
in quite some time. Glenda Jackson
and Ben Kingsley are two painfully
recessive types leading lives of utter
loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three
large sea turtles from the London
Zoo; it's the biggest adventure of
their lives, and it transforms them
(slightly). The movie is long on a
kind of petrified British charm, and
it unfolds at a leisurely, bordering

on torpid pace; the stars appear to
have been chosen primarily for their
resemblance to the turtles (they
aren't required to do much acting).
Pinter and director John lrvin dis
sect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays this week.
Runaway Train (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Andrei Konchalovsky film
belongs to that sub-genre of violent
action picture which trades heavily
in existential machismo. It's about a
ruthless criminal, played by Jon
Voight, who escapes from a maxi
mum security prison in Alaska only
to hop a train which becomes a
runaway when the engineer croaks.
The premise of the movie is that life
is a bitch, and then you die: Voight's
character is a kind of ruthless
Everyman, and the train is an all
purpose metaphor for life, technol
ogy, society, prison or whatever you
want (it's so loaded down with
meaning, it's a wonder it can move
at all). Konchalovsky is a hell of an
action filmmaker, but he's got to
lighten up; the screenplay, by
Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and
Edward Bunker (from a story by
Akira Kurosawa), is overstuffed
with pretentious silliness; Voight's
performance (for which he was
nominated for an Oscar) is truly aw
ful.
Plays Saturday with "White
Nights."
One Hew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
(1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto

Ken Kesey's novel, one of the sig
nal books of the 19605, is the tale of a
renegade in a psychiatric hospital,
told by another patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it probably would require
a director of Martin Scorcese's
caliber to translate it to the screen
faithfully — it's certainly beyond the
talents of Milos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence Hauben
and Bo Goldman, turned it into a
conventional third-person narrative
— a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson for the
role of McMurphey, the rebel, even
before Forman did, but though he
might have been tempted to simply
skate through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance that may
be, along with "The Last Detail,"
his most impressive work. The more
unusual casting coups are in the se
lection of two relative unknowns,
Louise Fletcher and Brad Dourif,
for the roles of Nurse Ratched (who
must, in order for the script to work,
be considerably more comprehensi
ble than in the book) and Billy Bib
bitt: both are superb.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Prizzi's Honor."
A Room with a View (1986)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
E.M. Forster described his Ed
wardian romantic/comic novel as
"clear and bright and well
constructed, but so thin," and that's
a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James
Ivory from an adaptation by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala. Jhabvala's

screenplay is very faithful to Forster,
and preserves much of his beauti
fully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger
thematic, more didactic elements of
the novel (such as Forster s sternly
humanistic belief in the supreme
sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to in
nate the characters' passions; they
keep everything very light, enter
taining and borderline frivolous, and
the movie stays exceptionally neat
and well-constructed simply by fol
lowing Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and
enjoyable group, with the slight ex
ception of Helena Bonham Carter,
whose Lucy Honeychurch doesn't
seem quite the vessel for passion
that Forster intended. She's very
likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith. Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm
Elliot, Julian Sands, Simon Callow,
Rosemary Leach, Judi Dench and
others.
Plays this week.
L'Age d'Or (1930)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali
collaborated on their second sur
realist film two years after "Un
Chien Andalou": There's nothing in
it quite as shocking as the slitting of
the eyeball in the earlier picture, but
it's outrageously iconoclastic (the
icons are Bunuel's pet ones — the
bourgeoisie and the Catholic
Church) and outrageously funny.
Gaston Modot and Lya Lys play the
couple who insist on making love all
over Paris, and Max Ernst is in the
cast, too.
Plays Thursday with "Hail Mary."
My Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from

Pakistanis in modern South London,

whose Lucy Honeychurch doesn't
seem quite the vessel for passion
that Forster intended. She's very
likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith. Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm
Elliot, Julian Sands, Simon Callow,
Rosemary Leach, Judi Dench and
others.

L'Age d'Or (1930)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali
collaborated on their second sur
realist film two years after "Un
Chien Andalou": There's nothing in
it quite as shocking as the slitting of
the eyeball in the earlier picture, but
it's outrageously iconoclastic (the
icons are Bunuel's pet ones — the
bourgeoisie and the Catholic
Church) and outrageously funny.
Gaston Modot and Lya Lys play the
couple who insist on making love all
over Paris, and Max Ernst is in the
cast, too.
Plays Thursday with "Hail Mary."
My Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from
England spins together an entire
socio-political milieu; it's about
Pakistanis in modern South London,
who work in a variety of tawdry
businesses — some legitimate, some
not. The world we see is divided into
the enterprising, entrepreneurial
Pakistanis and the white, racist
street punks, aimless casualties of
Thatchers economic policies. All of
the characters spend much time dis
cussing their politics, but they're
never just pushing around a series of
position papers — they grab onto
their beliefs and turn them into
designs for living. Director Stephen
Frears and writer Hanif Kureishi do
their characters full justice; they
create the sense of a whole commu
nity living and thriving off the South
London decay, and each aspect they
reveal is a surprising discovery.
Larger issues grow out of the char
acters' sexual, financial and political
motivations, but Frears and
Kureishi keep the mixture light and
frothy, and they don't pass harsh
judgments. It's a wonderfully ex
uberant movie, with a terrific group
of performers: Gordon Warnecke,
Daniel Day Lewis, Saeed Jaffrey,
Roshan Seth, Rita Wolf, Shirley
Anne Field and Derrick Blanche.
Plays this week with "The
Makioka Sisters."
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical comedy
made an immediate connection with
young audiences, and it has never
lost it, even though the broad revue
style is dated now and the jangling

editing and Nichols' insistent use of
close-up were always an aesthetic
assault. The major drawback to the
Calder Willingham/Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, un
subtle attack on the bourgeois
values of the older generation — is,
ironically, probably what keeps it
popular. On the other hand, some of
the dialogue has stayed remarkably
fresh, and there are three highly
commendable performances: a full
scale one by Anne Bancroft as em
bittered, overpoweringly seductive
Mrs. Robinson, an imaginative
comic one by Dustin Hoffman as the
confused hero, Benjamin Braddock,
and a small, generally ignored one
by Katharine Ross as Bancroft's
daughter, Elaine, whom Benjamin
courts. Less impressive work is done
by Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robin
son, William Daniels as Mr. Brad
dock and Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs.
Braddock. (No wonder the older
generation gets roasted in this
picture, represented as it is by three
of the least attractive, least

believable actors in the business.)
Richard Dreyfuss shows up in a bit
at the rooming house (run by Nor
man Fell). The songs, for anyone
who has resided in a cave for the last
19 years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday night.
Prizzi's Honor (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses
and triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic finagling. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception; the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age, but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two

main characters — hitpeople Char
ley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and
Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey
as Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Anjelica Huston
(John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat,
Maerose (she's Charley's former
fiance, and she's out to get him).
With Robert Loggia and John Ran
dolph.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest."
Bananas(l97l)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey

Rose). Much of it takes place in a
banana republic where Woody is
fighting for the revolution; there is
also a screwball courtroom sequence
in the second half that is a classic.
Louise Lasser co-stars as a woman
whose every action seems to be a
parody of something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. The direction and
photography are clumsy beyond the
telling, but most of the time you're
too helpless with laughter to notice.
Plays Thursday with "Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex."
Top Gun (1986)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
It's tough to decide which is the
more impressive machine — the
fighter jets that carom across the
wide screen in Dolby stereo, or the
movie itself, which is a superbly
crafted missile targeting the box
office. This picture is nothing more
than a string of terrific commercials
for the armed forces (with a Coca-

Cola ad volleyball game and a Cal
vin Klein ad love scene thrown in),
and it's the kind of "socko' enter
tainment production executives
have dreams about. The screenplay,
by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.,
might have been phoned in, and
director Tony Scott, who began his
career making television commer
cials, is certainly the man for the
job. Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy
fighter jock who gets the girl (Kelly
McGillis), loses his best friend,
grows as a person, etc., etc. I he
aerial combat scenes are very im
pressive, and it's literally impossible
to tell when the models take over for
the real jets. There are two good
jokes associated with this produc
tion: Jerry Bruckheimer and Don
Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop"
and now this, still insist that they are
risk-takers, who "don't follow
trends"; and the U.S. Navy actually
got paid more than $ l million for all
this fantastic publicity.
Plays this week.
The Makioka Sisters (1983)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
Kon Ichikawa directed and co
wrote (with Shinya Hidaka) this
adaptation of Junichiro Tanizaki's
novel, and Ichikawa engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost
miraculous. Both novel and film are
an elegy to the changing lives of four
sisters who've established their
family name and fortune in Osaka
on the eve of Japan's involvement in
World War 11. Ichikawa's version
may be the epitome of what is called
"seamless" moviemaking; we follow

the characters and watch their
relationships develop and incidents
come together without recognizing
any big climactic moments, yet the
entire movie has an emotional flow
that carries us along and ties the
events together. The film is like a
walk down a beautiful Japanese gar
den path — you don't anticipate
what's coming, you just take in the
wealth of patterns and colors, and
you may be surprised by an unex
pected perspective or juxtaposition
of design. The actresses who play
the four sisters give the most subtle,
delicately varied performances
you're likely to see this or any other
year; they are Keiko Kishi, Yoshiko
Sakuma, Sayuri Yoshinaga and
Yuko Kotegawa. The husbands of
the two eldest daughters are played
by Koji Ishizaka and Juzo Itami, and
the unreally perfect, shimmering
photography is by Kiyoshi
Hasegawa.
Plays this week with " My Beauti
ful Laundrette."
The Conformist (1971)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Leaves fly ferociously into the
camera as if possessed; tiny, rat-like
dogs overrun an invalid's bed; a bu
reaucrat sits, Magritte-like, at an
immense marble desk placed
squarely in the center of an immense
office. Bernardo Bertolucci's film of
the Alberto Moravia novel, set in
Italy in the late 19305, is so imagisti
cally rich that you grow delirious
while you watch. Intellectually, the
treatment of fascism as unresolved
homosexual tension may not be sat

isfying, but visually and emotionally
this is a great movie, made by a true
poet-director. The cast is extraordi
nary, too; Jean-Louis Trintignant as
the fascist, Stefania Sandrelli as his
silly, endearing wife, and
Dominique Sanda as the other
woman.
Plays Tuesday with "The
Stranger."
White Nights (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script is poorly written
hokum, the direction is merely com
petent and the movie wastes
Gregory Hines in a dour, ill
conceived role that only allows for
his super-aggressive, jangly style of
tap dancing ("tap improvography,"
which affords few of the pleasures
we get from the wonderfully
relaxed, fluid tap dancing of Gene
Kelly and Fred Astaire). But Mik
hail Baryshnikov, who opens the
movie explosively with a perfor
mance of Roland Petit's "Le Jeune
Homme et la Mort," triumphs, both
in his dancing and in his acting.
Director Taylor Hackford and
screenwriters James Goldman and
Eric Hughes allow Baryshnikov to
display the wizardry he's celebrated
for — a dozen or more pirouettes,
backward jelees on points — as well
as the wit and boundless physical
imagination that characterize his
work on stage. He gives a supremely
confident performance — a star turn
— and he holds the movie together.
With Helen Mirren, Isabella Rossel
lini, Jerzy Skolimowski and
Geraldine Page.
Plays Saturday with "Runaway
Train."

Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this movie
contains the best five minutes
Woody Allen has ever done: the
sketch in which he plays a sperm
being prepared for launching. (Tony
Randall and Burt Reynolds are at
the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor
who falls in love with a sheep named
Daisy. The first skit, with Allen as
an unfunny jester and Anthony
Quayle and Lynn Redgrave as the
king and queen, begins promisingly
but declines quickly when Allen gets
his hand caught in Redgrave's chas
tity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci
fi take-off about a giant breast
(silly), a quiz show called "What's
My Perversion?" (pretty bad) and a
quarter-of-an-hour with Lou Jacobi
as a transvestite (hopeless).
Plays Thursday with "Bananas."
Turtle Diary (1986)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows
more affection for novelist Russell
Hoban's epigrammatic characters
than he has for anyone in his movies
in quite some time. Glenda Jackson
and Ben Kingsley are two painfully
recessive types leading lives of utter
loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three
large sea turtles from the London
Zoo; it's the biggest adventure of
their lives, and it transforms them
(slightly). The movie is long on a
kind of petrified British charm, and
it unfolds at a leisurely, bordering

on torpid pace; the stars appear to
have been chosen primarily for their
resemblance to the turtles (they
aren't required to do much acting).
Pinter and director John lrvin dis
sect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays this week.
Runaway Train (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Andrei Konchalovsky film
belongs to that sub-genre of violent
action picture which trades heavily
in existential machismo. It's about a
ruthless criminal, played by Jon
Voight, who escapes from a maxi
mum security prison in Alaska only
to hop a train which becomes a
runaway when the engineer croaks.
The premise of the movie is that life
is a bitch, and then you die: Voight's
character is a kind of ruthless
Everyman, and the train is an all
purpose metaphor for life, technol
ogy, society, prison or whatever you
want (it's so loaded down with
meaning, it's a wonder it can move
at all). Konchalovsky is a hell of an
action filmmaker, but he's got to
lighten up; the screenplay, by
Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and
Edward Bunker (from a story by
Akira Kurosawa), is overstuffed
with pretentious silliness; Voight's
performance (for which he was
nominated for an Oscar) is truly aw
ful.
Plays Saturday with "White
Nights."
One Hew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
(1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto

Ken Kesey's novel, one of the sig
nal books of the 19605, is the tale of a
renegade in a psychiatric hospital,
told by another patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it probably would require
a director of Martin Scorcese's
caliber to translate it to the screen
faithfully — it's certainly beyond the
talents of Milos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence Hauben
and Bo Goldman, turned it into a
conventional third-person narrative
— a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson for the
role of McMurphey, the rebel, even
before Forman did, but though he
might have been tempted to simply
skate through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance that may
be, along with "The Last Detail,"
his most impressive work. The more
unusual casting coups are in the se
lection of two relative unknowns,
Louise Fletcher and Brad Dourif,
for the roles of Nurse Ratched (who
must, in order for the script to work,
be considerably more comprehensi
ble than in the book) and Billy Bib
bitt: both are superb.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Prizzi's Honor."
A Room with a View (1986)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
E.M. Forster described his Ed
wardian romantic/comic novel as
"clear and bright and well
constructed, but so thin," and that's
a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James
Ivory from an adaptation by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala. Jhabvala's

screenplay is very faithful to Forster,
and preserves much of his beauti
fully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger
thematic, more didactic elements of
the novel (such as Forster s sternly
humanistic belief in the supreme
sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to in
nate the characters' passions; they
keep everything very light, enter
taining and borderline frivolous, and
the movie stays exceptionally neat
and well-constructed simply by fol
lowing Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and
enjoyable group, with the slight ex
ception of Helena Bonham Carter,
whose Lucy Honeychurch doesn't
seem quite the vessel for passion
that Forster intended. She's very
likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith. Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm
Elliot, Julian Sands, Simon Callow,
Rosemary Leach, Judi Dench and

A Room with a View (1986)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
E.M. Forster described his Ed
wardian romantic/comic novel as
"clear and bright and well
constructed, but so thin," and that's
a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James
Ivory from an adaptation by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala. Jhabvala's

screenplay is very faithful to Forster,
and preserves much of his beauti
fully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger
thematic, more didactic elements of
the novel (such as Forster s sternly
humanistic belief in the supreme
sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to in
nate the characters' passions; they
keep everything very light, enter
taining and borderline frivolous, and
the movie stays exceptionally neat
and well-constructed simply by fol
lowing Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and
enjoyable group, with the slight ex
ception of Helena Bonham Carter,
whose Lucy Honeychurch doesn't
seem quite the vessel for passion
that Forster intended. She's very
likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith. Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm
Elliot, Julian Sands, Simon Callow,
Rosemary Leach, Judi Dench and
others.
Plays this week.
L'Age d'Or (1930)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali
collaborated on their second sur
realist film two years after "Un
Chien Andalou": There's nothing in
it quite as shocking as the slitting of
the eyeball in the earlier picture, but
it's outrageously iconoclastic (the
icons are Bunuel's pet ones — the
bourgeoisie and the Catholic
Church) and outrageously funny.
Gaston Modot and Lya Lys play the
couple who insist on making love all
over Paris, and Max Ernst is in the
cast, too.
Plays Thursday with "Hail Mary."
My Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from
England spins together an entire
socio-political milieu; it's about
Pakistanis in modern South London,
who work in a variety of tawdry
businesses — some legitimate, some
not. The world we see is divided into
the enterprising, entrepreneurial
Pakistanis and the white, racist
street punks, aimless casualties of
Thatchers economic policies. All of
the characters spend much time dis
cussing their politics, but they're
never just pushing around a series of
position papers — they grab onto
their beliefs and turn them into
designs for living. Director Stephen
Frears and writer Hanif Kureishi do
their characters full justice; they
create the sense of a whole commu
nity living and thriving off the South
London decay, and each aspect they
reveal is a surprising discovery.
Larger issues grow out of the char
acters' sexual, financial and political
motivations, but Frears and
Kureishi keep the mixture light and
frothy, and they don't pass harsh
judgments. It's a wonderfully ex
uberant movie, with a terrific group
of performers: Gordon Warnecke,
Daniel Day Lewis, Saeed Jaffrey,
Roshan Seth, Rita Wolf, Shirley
Anne Field and Derrick Blanche.
Plays this week with "The
Makioka Sisters."
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical comedy
made an immediate connection with
young audiences, and it has never
lost it, even though the broad revue
style is dated now and the jangling

editing and Nichols' insistent use of
close-up were always an aesthetic
assault. The major drawback to the
Calder Willingham/Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, un
subtle attack on the bourgeois
values of the older generation — is,
ironically, probably what keeps it
popular. On the other hand, some of
the dialogue has stayed remarkably
fresh, and there are three highly
commendable performances: a full
scale one by Anne Bancroft as em
bittered, overpoweringly seductive
Mrs. Robinson, an imaginative
comic one by Dustin Hoffman as the
confused hero, Benjamin Braddock,
and a small, generally ignored one
by Katharine Ross as Bancroft's
daughter, Elaine, whom Benjamin
courts. Less impressive work is done
by Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robin
son, William Daniels as Mr. Brad
dock and Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs.
Braddock. (No wonder the older
generation gets roasted in this
picture, represented as it is by three
of the least attractive, least

believable actors in the business.)
Richard Dreyfuss shows up in a bit
at the rooming house (run by Nor
man Fell). The songs, for anyone
who has resided in a cave for the last
19 years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday night.
Prizzi's Honor (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses
and triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic finagling. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception; the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age, but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two

main characters — hitpeople Char
ley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and
Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey
as Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Anjelica Huston
(John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat,
Maerose (she's Charley's former
fiance, and she's out to get him).
With Robert Loggia and John Ran
dolph.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest."
Bananas(l97l)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey

Rose). Much of it takes place in a
banana republic where Woody is
fighting for the revolution; there is
also a screwball courtroom sequence
in the second half that is a classic.
Louise Lasser co-stars as a woman
whose every action seems to be a
parody of something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. The direction and
photography are clumsy beyond the
telling, but most of the time you're
too helpless with laughter to notice.
Plays Thursday with "Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex."
Top Gun (1986)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
It's tough to decide which is the
more impressive machine — the
fighter jets that carom across the
wide screen in Dolby stereo, or the
movie itself, which is a superbly
crafted missile targeting the box
office. This picture is nothing more
than a string of terrific commercials
for the armed forces (with a Coca-

Cola ad volleyball game and a Cal
vin Klein ad love scene thrown in),
and it's the kind of "socko' enter
tainment production executives
have dreams about. The screenplay,
by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.,
might have been phoned in, and
director Tony Scott, who began his
career making television commer
cials, is certainly the man for the
job. Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy
fighter jock who gets the girl (Kelly
McGillis), loses his best friend,
grows as a person, etc., etc. I he
aerial combat scenes are very im
pressive, and it's literally impossible
to tell when the models take over for
the real jets. There are two good
jokes associated with this produc
tion: Jerry Bruckheimer and Don
Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop"
and now this, still insist that they are
risk-takers, who "don't follow
trends"; and the U.S. Navy actually
got paid more than $ l million for all
this fantastic publicity.
Plays this week.
The Makioka Sisters (1983)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
Kon Ichikawa directed and co
wrote (with Shinya Hidaka) this
adaptation of Junichiro Tanizaki's
novel, and Ichikawa engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost
miraculous. Both novel and film are
an elegy to the changing lives of four
sisters who've established their
family name and fortune in Osaka
on the eve of Japan's involvement in
World War 11. Ichikawa's version
may be the epitome of what is called
"seamless" moviemaking; we follow

the characters and watch their
relationships develop and incidents
come together without recognizing
any big climactic moments, yet the
entire movie has an emotional flow
that carries us along and ties the
events together. The film is like a
walk down a beautiful Japanese gar
den path — you don't anticipate
what's coming, you just take in the
wealth of patterns and colors, and
you may be surprised by an unex
pected perspective or juxtaposition
of design. The actresses who play
the four sisters give the most subtle,
delicately varied performances
you're likely to see this or any other
year; they are Keiko Kishi, Yoshiko
Sakuma, Sayuri Yoshinaga and
Yuko Kotegawa. The husbands of
the two eldest daughters are played
by Koji Ishizaka and Juzo Itami, and
the unreally perfect, shimmering
photography is by Kiyoshi
Hasegawa.
Plays this week with " My Beauti
ful Laundrette."
The Conformist (1971)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Leaves fly ferociously into the
camera as if possessed; tiny, rat-like
dogs overrun an invalid's bed; a bu
reaucrat sits, Magritte-like, at an
immense marble desk placed
squarely in the center of an immense
office. Bernardo Bertolucci's film of
the Alberto Moravia novel, set in
Italy in the late 19305, is so imagisti
cally rich that you grow delirious
while you watch. Intellectually, the
treatment of fascism as unresolved
homosexual tension may not be sat

isfying, but visually and emotionally
this is a great movie, made by a true
poet-director. The cast is extraordi
nary, too; Jean-Louis Trintignant as
the fascist, Stefania Sandrelli as his
silly, endearing wife, and
Dominique Sanda as the other
woman.
Plays Tuesday with "The
Stranger."
White Nights (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script is poorly written
hokum, the direction is merely com
petent and the movie wastes
Gregory Hines in a dour, ill
conceived role that only allows for
his super-aggressive, jangly style of
tap dancing ("tap improvography,"
which affords few of the pleasures
we get from the wonderfully
relaxed, fluid tap dancing of Gene
Kelly and Fred Astaire). But Mik
hail Baryshnikov, who opens the
movie explosively with a perfor
mance of Roland Petit's "Le Jeune
Homme et la Mort," triumphs, both
in his dancing and in his acting.
Director Taylor Hackford and
screenwriters James Goldman and
Eric Hughes allow Baryshnikov to
display the wizardry he's celebrated
for — a dozen or more pirouettes,
backward jelees on points — as well
as the wit and boundless physical
imagination that characterize his
work on stage. He gives a supremely
confident performance — a star turn
— and he holds the movie together.
With Helen Mirren, Isabella Rossel
lini, Jerzy Skolimowski and
Geraldine Page.
Plays Saturday with "Runaway
Train."

Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this movie
contains the best five minutes
Woody Allen has ever done: the
sketch in which he plays a sperm
being prepared for launching. (Tony
Randall and Burt Reynolds are at
the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor
who falls in love with a sheep named
Daisy. The first skit, with Allen as
an unfunny jester and Anthony
Quayle and Lynn Redgrave as the
king and queen, begins promisingly
but declines quickly when Allen gets
his hand caught in Redgrave's chas
tity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci
fi take-off about a giant breast
(silly), a quiz show called "What's
My Perversion?" (pretty bad) and a
quarter-of-an-hour with Lou Jacobi
as a transvestite (hopeless).
Plays Thursday with "Bananas."
Turtle Diary (1986)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows
more affection for novelist Russell
Hoban's epigrammatic characters
than he has for anyone in his movies
in quite some time. Glenda Jackson
and Ben Kingsley are two painfully
recessive types leading lives of utter
loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three
large sea turtles from the London
Zoo; it's the biggest adventure of
their lives, and it transforms them
(slightly). The movie is long on a
kind of petrified British charm, and
it unfolds at a leisurely, bordering

on torpid pace; the stars appear to
have been chosen primarily for their
resemblance to the turtles (they
aren't required to do much acting).
Pinter and director John lrvin dis
sect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays this week.
Runaway Train (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Andrei Konchalovsky film
belongs to that sub-genre of violent
action picture which trades heavily
in existential machismo. It's about a
ruthless criminal, played by Jon
Voight, who escapes from a maxi
mum security prison in Alaska only
to hop a train which becomes a
runaway when the engineer croaks.
The premise of the movie is that life
is a bitch, and then you die: Voight's
character is a kind of ruthless
Everyman, and the train is an all
purpose metaphor for life, technol
ogy, society, prison or whatever you
want (it's so loaded down with
meaning, it's a wonder it can move
at all). Konchalovsky is a hell of an
action filmmaker, but he's got to
lighten up; the screenplay, by
Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and
Edward Bunker (from a story by
Akira Kurosawa), is overstuffed
with pretentious silliness; Voight's
performance (for which he was
nominated for an Oscar) is truly aw
ful.
Plays Saturday with "White
Nights."
One Hew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
(1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto

Ken Kesey's novel, one of the sig
nal books of the 19605, is the tale of a
renegade in a psychiatric hospital,
told by another patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it probably would require
a director of Martin Scorcese's
caliber to translate it to the screen
faithfully — it's certainly beyond the
talents of Milos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence Hauben
and Bo Goldman, turned it into a
conventional third-person narrative
— a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson for the
role of McMurphey, the rebel, even
before Forman did, but though he
might have been tempted to simply
skate through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance that may
be, along with "The Last Detail,"
his most impressive work. The more
unusual casting coups are in the se
lection of two relative unknowns,
Louise Fletcher and Brad Dourif,
for the roles of Nurse Ratched (who
must, in order for the script to work,
be considerably more comprehensi
ble than in the book) and Billy Bib
bitt: both are superb.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Prizzi's Honor."

faithfully — it's certainly beyond the
talents of Milos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence Hauben
and Bo Goldman, turned it into a
conventional third-person narrative
— a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson for the
role of McMurphey, the rebel, even
before Forman did, but though he
might have been tempted to simply
skate through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance that may
be, along with "The Last Detail,"
his most impressive work. The more
unusual casting coups are in the se
lection of two relative unknowns,
Louise Fletcher and Brad Dourif,
for the roles of Nurse Ratched (who
must, in order for the script to work,
be considerably more comprehensi
ble than in the book) and Billy Bib
bitt: both are superb.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Prizzi's Honor."
A Room with a View (1986)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
E.M. Forster described his Ed
wardian romantic/comic novel as
"clear and bright and well
constructed, but so thin," and that's
a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James
Ivory from an adaptation by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala. Jhabvala's

screenplay is very faithful to Forster,
and preserves much of his beauti
fully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger
thematic, more didactic elements of
the novel (such as Forster s sternly
humanistic belief in the supreme
sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to in
nate the characters' passions; they
keep everything very light, enter
taining and borderline frivolous, and
the movie stays exceptionally neat
and well-constructed simply by fol
lowing Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and
enjoyable group, with the slight ex
ception of Helena Bonham Carter,
whose Lucy Honeychurch doesn't
seem quite the vessel for passion
that Forster intended. She's very
likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith. Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm
Elliot, Julian Sands, Simon Callow,
Rosemary Leach, Judi Dench and
others.
Plays this week.
L'Age d'Or (1930)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali
collaborated on their second sur
realist film two years after "Un
Chien Andalou": There's nothing in
it quite as shocking as the slitting of
the eyeball in the earlier picture, but
it's outrageously iconoclastic (the
icons are Bunuel's pet ones — the
bourgeoisie and the Catholic
Church) and outrageously funny.
Gaston Modot and Lya Lys play the
couple who insist on making love all
over Paris, and Max Ernst is in the
cast, too.
Plays Thursday with "Hail Mary."
My Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from
England spins together an entire
socio-political milieu; it's about
Pakistanis in modern South London,
who work in a variety of tawdry
businesses — some legitimate, some
not. The world we see is divided into
the enterprising, entrepreneurial
Pakistanis and the white, racist
street punks, aimless casualties of
Thatchers economic policies. All of
the characters spend much time dis
cussing their politics, but they're
never just pushing around a series of
position papers — they grab onto
their beliefs and turn them into
designs for living. Director Stephen
Frears and writer Hanif Kureishi do
their characters full justice; they
create the sense of a whole commu
nity living and thriving off the South
London decay, and each aspect they
reveal is a surprising discovery.
Larger issues grow out of the char
acters' sexual, financial and political
motivations, but Frears and
Kureishi keep the mixture light and
frothy, and they don't pass harsh
judgments. It's a wonderfully ex
uberant movie, with a terrific group
of performers: Gordon Warnecke,
Daniel Day Lewis, Saeed Jaffrey,
Roshan Seth, Rita Wolf, Shirley
Anne Field and Derrick Blanche.
Plays this week with "The
Makioka Sisters."
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical comedy
made an immediate connection with
young audiences, and it has never
lost it, even though the broad revue
style is dated now and the jangling

editing and Nichols' insistent use of
close-up were always an aesthetic
assault. The major drawback to the
Calder Willingham/Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, un
subtle attack on the bourgeois
values of the older generation — is,
ironically, probably what keeps it
popular. On the other hand, some of
the dialogue has stayed remarkably
fresh, and there are three highly
commendable performances: a full
scale one by Anne Bancroft as em
bittered, overpoweringly seductive
Mrs. Robinson, an imaginative
comic one by Dustin Hoffman as the
confused hero, Benjamin Braddock,
and a small, generally ignored one
by Katharine Ross as Bancroft's
daughter, Elaine, whom Benjamin
courts. Less impressive work is done
by Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robin
son, William Daniels as Mr. Brad
dock and Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs.
Braddock. (No wonder the older
generation gets roasted in this
picture, represented as it is by three
of the least attractive, least

believable actors in the business.)
Richard Dreyfuss shows up in a bit
at the rooming house (run by Nor
man Fell). The songs, for anyone
who has resided in a cave for the last
19 years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday night.
Prizzi's Honor (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses
and triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic finagling. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception; the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age, but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two

main characters — hitpeople Char
ley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and
Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey
as Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Anjelica Huston
(John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat,
Maerose (she's Charley's former
fiance, and she's out to get him).
With Robert Loggia and John Ran
dolph.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest."
Bananas(l97l)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey

Rose). Much of it takes place in a
banana republic where Woody is
fighting for the revolution; there is
also a screwball courtroom sequence
in the second half that is a classic.
Louise Lasser co-stars as a woman
whose every action seems to be a
parody of something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. The direction and
photography are clumsy beyond the
telling, but most of the time you're
too helpless with laughter to notice.
Plays Thursday with "Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex."
Top Gun (1986)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
It's tough to decide which is the
more impressive machine — the
fighter jets that carom across the
wide screen in Dolby stereo, or the
movie itself, which is a superbly
crafted missile targeting the box
office. This picture is nothing more
than a string of terrific commercials
for the armed forces (with a Coca-

Cola ad volleyball game and a Cal
vin Klein ad love scene thrown in),
and it's the kind of "socko' enter
tainment production executives
have dreams about. The screenplay,
by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.,
might have been phoned in, and
director Tony Scott, who began his
career making television commer
cials, is certainly the man for the
job. Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy
fighter jock who gets the girl (Kelly
McGillis), loses his best friend,
grows as a person, etc., etc. I he
aerial combat scenes are very im
pressive, and it's literally impossible
to tell when the models take over for
the real jets. There are two good
jokes associated with this produc
tion: Jerry Bruckheimer and Don
Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop"
and now this, still insist that they are
risk-takers, who "don't follow
trends"; and the U.S. Navy actually
got paid more than $ l million for all
this fantastic publicity.
Plays this week.
The Makioka Sisters (1983)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
Kon Ichikawa directed and co
wrote (with Shinya Hidaka) this
adaptation of Junichiro Tanizaki's
novel, and Ichikawa engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost
miraculous. Both novel and film are
an elegy to the changing lives of four
sisters who've established their
family name and fortune in Osaka
on the eve of Japan's involvement in
World War 11. Ichikawa's version
may be the epitome of what is called
"seamless" moviemaking; we follow

the characters and watch their
relationships develop and incidents
come together without recognizing
any big climactic moments, yet the
entire movie has an emotional flow
that carries us along and ties the
events together. The film is like a
walk down a beautiful Japanese gar
den path — you don't anticipate
what's coming, you just take in the
wealth of patterns and colors, and
you may be surprised by an unex
pected perspective or juxtaposition
of design. The actresses who play
the four sisters give the most subtle,
delicately varied performances
you're likely to see this or any other
year; they are Keiko Kishi, Yoshiko
Sakuma, Sayuri Yoshinaga and
Yuko Kotegawa. The husbands of
the two eldest daughters are played
by Koji Ishizaka and Juzo Itami, and
the unreally perfect, shimmering
photography is by Kiyoshi
Hasegawa.
Plays this week with " My Beauti
ful Laundrette."
The Conformist (1971)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Leaves fly ferociously into the
camera as if possessed; tiny, rat-like
dogs overrun an invalid's bed; a bu
reaucrat sits, Magritte-like, at an
immense marble desk placed
squarely in the center of an immense
office. Bernardo Bertolucci's film of
the Alberto Moravia novel, set in
Italy in the late 19305, is so imagisti
cally rich that you grow delirious
while you watch. Intellectually, the
treatment of fascism as unresolved
homosexual tension may not be sat

isfying, but visually and emotionally
this is a great movie, made by a true
poet-director. The cast is extraordi
nary, too; Jean-Louis Trintignant as
the fascist, Stefania Sandrelli as his
silly, endearing wife, and
Dominique Sanda as the other
woman.
Plays Tuesday with "The
Stranger."
White Nights (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The script is poorly written
hokum, the direction is merely com
petent and the movie wastes
Gregory Hines in a dour, ill
conceived role that only allows for
his super-aggressive, jangly style of
tap dancing ("tap improvography,"
which affords few of the pleasures
we get from the wonderfully
relaxed, fluid tap dancing of Gene
Kelly and Fred Astaire). But Mik
hail Baryshnikov, who opens the
movie explosively with a perfor
mance of Roland Petit's "Le Jeune
Homme et la Mort," triumphs, both
in his dancing and in his acting.
Director Taylor Hackford and
screenwriters James Goldman and
Eric Hughes allow Baryshnikov to
display the wizardry he's celebrated
for — a dozen or more pirouettes,
backward jelees on points — as well
as the wit and boundless physical
imagination that characterize his
work on stage. He gives a supremely
confident performance — a star turn
— and he holds the movie together.
With Helen Mirren, Isabella Rossel
lini, Jerzy Skolimowski and
Geraldine Page.
Plays Saturday with "Runaway
Train."

Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this movie
contains the best five minutes
Woody Allen has ever done: the
sketch in which he plays a sperm
being prepared for launching. (Tony
Randall and Burt Reynolds are at
the controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which an in
spired Gene Wilder plays a doctor
who falls in love with a sheep named
Daisy. The first skit, with Allen as
an unfunny jester and Anthony
Quayle and Lynn Redgrave as the
king and queen, begins promisingly
but declines quickly when Allen gets
his hand caught in Redgrave's chas
tity belt. There are also a parody of
Antonioni (reasonably funny), a sci
fi take-off about a giant breast
(silly), a quiz show called "What's
My Perversion?" (pretty bad) and a
quarter-of-an-hour with Lou Jacobi
as a transvestite (hopeless).
Plays Thursday with "Bananas."
Turtle Diary (1986)
Park Theatre, Menlo Park
Screenwriter Harold Pinter shows
more affection for novelist Russell
Hoban's epigrammatic characters
than he has for anyone in his movies
in quite some time. Glenda Jackson
and Ben Kingsley are two painfully
recessive types leading lives of utter
loneliness, until they simultaneously
hatch the scheme of releasing three
large sea turtles from the London
Zoo; it's the biggest adventure of
their lives, and it transforms them
(slightly). The movie is long on a
kind of petrified British charm, and
it unfolds at a leisurely, bordering

on torpid pace; the stars appear to
have been chosen primarily for their
resemblance to the turtles (they
aren't required to do much acting).
Pinter and director John lrvin dis
sect the themes of the novel with
enervating precision and care.
Plays this week.
Runaway Train (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Andrei Konchalovsky film
belongs to that sub-genre of violent
action picture which trades heavily
in existential machismo. It's about a
ruthless criminal, played by Jon
Voight, who escapes from a maxi
mum security prison in Alaska only
to hop a train which becomes a
runaway when the engineer croaks.
The premise of the movie is that life
is a bitch, and then you die: Voight's
character is a kind of ruthless
Everyman, and the train is an all
purpose metaphor for life, technol
ogy, society, prison or whatever you
want (it's so loaded down with
meaning, it's a wonder it can move
at all). Konchalovsky is a hell of an
action filmmaker, but he's got to
lighten up; the screenplay, by
Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and
Edward Bunker (from a story by
Akira Kurosawa), is overstuffed
with pretentious silliness; Voight's
performance (for which he was
nominated for an Oscar) is truly aw
ful.
Plays Saturday with "White
Nights."
One Hew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
(1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto

Ken Kesey's novel, one of the sig
nal books of the 19605, is the tale of a
renegade in a psychiatric hospital,
told by another patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it probably would require
a director of Martin Scorcese's
caliber to translate it to the screen
faithfully — it's certainly beyond the
talents of Milos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence Hauben
and Bo Goldman, turned it into a
conventional third-person narrative
— a first-rate one — and Forman

want (it's so loaded down with
meaning, it's a wonder it can move
at all). Konchalovsky is a hell of an
action filmmaker, but he's got to
lighten up; the screenplay, by
Djordje Milicevic, Paul Zindel and
Edward Bunker (from a story by
Akira Kurosawa), is overstuffed
with pretentious silliness; Voight's
performance (for which he was
nominated for an Oscar) is truly aw
ful.
Plays Saturday with "White
Nights."
One Hew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
(1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto

Ken Kesey's novel, one of the sig
nal books of the 19605, is the tale of a
renegade in a psychiatric hospital,
told by another patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it probably would require
a director of Martin Scorcese's
caliber to translate it to the screen
faithfully — it's certainly beyond the
talents of Milos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence Hauben
and Bo Goldman, turned it into a
conventional third-person narrative
— a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson for the
role of McMurphey, the rebel, even
before Forman did, but though he
might have been tempted to simply
skate through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance that may
be, along with "The Last Detail,"
his most impressive work. The more
unusual casting coups are in the se
lection of two relative unknowns,
Louise Fletcher and Brad Dourif,
for the roles of Nurse Ratched (who
must, in order for the script to work,
be considerably more comprehensi
ble than in the book) and Billy Bib
bitt: both are superb.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Prizzi's Honor."
A Room with a View (1986)
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
E.M. Forster described his Ed
wardian romantic/comic novel as
"clear and bright and well
constructed, but so thin," and that's
a pretty accurate summing up of this
movie version, directed by James
Ivory from an adaptation by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala. Jhabvala's

screenplay is very faithful to Forster,
and preserves much of his beauti
fully modulated dialogue, while
downplaying some of the larger
thematic, more didactic elements of
the novel (such as Forster s sternly
humanistic belief in the supreme
sanctity of human love). The
filmmakers make little effort to in
nate the characters' passions; they
keep everything very light, enter
taining and borderline frivolous, and
the movie stays exceptionally neat
and well-constructed simply by fol
lowing Forster's design. The
performers here are a confident and
enjoyable group, with the slight ex
ception of Helena Bonham Carter,
whose Lucy Honeychurch doesn't
seem quite the vessel for passion
that Forster intended. She's very
likable, however, as are Maggie
Smith. Daniel Day Lewis, Denholm
Elliot, Julian Sands, Simon Callow,
Rosemary Leach, Judi Dench and
others.
Plays this week.
L'Age d'Or (1930)
U.C. Theatre, Berkeley
Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali
collaborated on their second sur
realist film two years after "Un
Chien Andalou": There's nothing in
it quite as shocking as the slitting of
the eyeball in the earlier picture, but
it's outrageously iconoclastic (the
icons are Bunuel's pet ones — the
bourgeoisie and the Catholic
Church) and outrageously funny.
Gaston Modot and Lya Lys play the
couple who insist on making love all
over Paris, and Max Ernst is in the
cast, too.
Plays Thursday with "Hail Mary."
