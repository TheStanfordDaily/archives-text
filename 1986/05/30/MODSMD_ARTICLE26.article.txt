My Beautiful Laundrette (1986)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
This bright new comedy from
England spins together an entire
socio-political milieu; it's about
Pakistanis in modern South London,
who work in a variety of tawdry
businesses — some legitimate, some
not. The world we see is divided into
the enterprising, entrepreneurial
Pakistanis and the white, racist
street punks, aimless casualties of
Thatchers economic policies. All of
the characters spend much time dis
cussing their politics, but they're
never just pushing around a series of
position papers — they grab onto
their beliefs and turn them into
designs for living. Director Stephen
Frears and writer Hanif Kureishi do
their characters full justice; they
create the sense of a whole commu
nity living and thriving off the South
London decay, and each aspect they
reveal is a surprising discovery.
Larger issues grow out of the char
acters' sexual, financial and political
motivations, but Frears and
Kureishi keep the mixture light and
frothy, and they don't pass harsh
judgments. It's a wonderfully ex
uberant movie, with a terrific group
of performers: Gordon Warnecke,
Daniel Day Lewis, Saeed Jaffrey,
Roshan Seth, Rita Wolf, Shirley
Anne Field and Derrick Blanche.
Plays this week with "The
Makioka Sisters."
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical comedy
made an immediate connection with
young audiences, and it has never
lost it, even though the broad revue
style is dated now and the jangling

editing and Nichols' insistent use of
close-up were always an aesthetic
assault. The major drawback to the
Calder Willingham/Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, un
subtle attack on the bourgeois
values of the older generation — is,
ironically, probably what keeps it
popular. On the other hand, some of
the dialogue has stayed remarkably
fresh, and there are three highly
commendable performances: a full
scale one by Anne Bancroft as em
bittered, overpoweringly seductive
Mrs. Robinson, an imaginative
comic one by Dustin Hoffman as the
confused hero, Benjamin Braddock,
and a small, generally ignored one
by Katharine Ross as Bancroft's
daughter, Elaine, whom Benjamin
courts. Less impressive work is done
by Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robin
son, William Daniels as Mr. Brad
dock and Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs.
Braddock. (No wonder the older
generation gets roasted in this
picture, represented as it is by three
of the least attractive, least

believable actors in the business.)
Richard Dreyfuss shows up in a bit
at the rooming house (run by Nor
man Fell). The songs, for anyone
who has resided in a cave for the last
19 years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday night.
Prizzi's Honor (1985)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This John Huston black comedy
aims to be a darkly funny parody of
the "Godfather" movies, with the
family squabbles, double crosses
and triple crosses twisted into lyrical
comic finagling. The screenplay, by
Janet Roach and Richard Condon
(from his book), never quite fulfills
the promise of this conception; the
movie seems over-plotted, and the
best ideas are underdeveloped. This
isn't really the fault of Huston, who
at 75 displays more energetic skill
than most directors half his age, but
the tone grows wobbly toward the
end, primarily because the
filmmakers don't give their two

main characters — hitpeople Char
ley Partanna (Jack Nicholson) and
Irene Walker (Kathleen Turner) —
enough comic personality to grab us.
Their relationship isn't very well
developed and doesn't make a lot of
sense; it's a real distraction from the
marvelous dirty doings of the sup
porting cast, which are clearly closer
to Huston's heart. William Hickey
as Don Corrado Prizzi, the wizened
and cackling godfather of the Prizzi
mob, is a joy, and Anjelica Huston
(John Huston's daughter) is the
delightfully wicked little hellcat,
Maerose (she's Charley's former
fiance, and she's out to get him).
With Robert Loggia and John Ran
dolph.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest."
Bananas(l97l)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is Woody Allen's funniest
movie (co-written with Mickey

Rose). Much of it takes place in a
banana republic where Woody is
fighting for the revolution; there is
also a screwball courtroom sequence
in the second half that is a classic.
Louise Lasser co-stars as a woman
whose every action seems to be a
parody of something in an Ingmar
Bergman picture. The direction and
photography are clumsy beyond the
telling, but most of the time you're
too helpless with laughter to notice.
Plays Thursday with "Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex."
Top Gun (1986)
Palo Alto Square, Palo Alto
It's tough to decide which is the
more impressive machine — the
fighter jets that carom across the
wide screen in Dolby stereo, or the
movie itself, which is a superbly
crafted missile targeting the box
office. This picture is nothing more
than a string of terrific commercials
for the armed forces (with a Coca-

Cola ad volleyball game and a Cal
vin Klein ad love scene thrown in),
and it's the kind of "socko' enter
tainment production executives
have dreams about. The screenplay,
by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr.,
might have been phoned in, and
director Tony Scott, who began his
career making television commer
cials, is certainly the man for the
job. Tom Cruise is a hotshot navy
fighter jock who gets the girl (Kelly
McGillis), loses his best friend,
grows as a person, etc., etc. I he
aerial combat scenes are very im
pressive, and it's literally impossible
to tell when the models take over for
the real jets. There are two good
jokes associated with this produc
tion: Jerry Bruckheimer and Don
Simpson, who co-produced
"Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop"
and now this, still insist that they are
risk-takers, who "don't follow
trends"; and the U.S. Navy actually
got paid more than $ l million for all
this fantastic publicity.
Plays this week.
The Makioka Sisters (1983)
Aquarius Theater, Palo Alto
Kon Ichikawa directed and co
wrote (with Shinya Hidaka) this
adaptation of Junichiro Tanizaki's
novel, and Ichikawa engages you in
ways so subtle it's almost
miraculous. Both novel and film are
an elegy to the changing lives of four
sisters who've established their
family name and fortune in Osaka
on the eve of Japan's involvement in
World War 11. Ichikawa's version
may be the epitome of what is called
"seamless" moviemaking; we follow
