## Cardinal golfers beached at the NCAAs Men in danger of missing cut today 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Letting a good round slip away
in the final holes, the Stanford
men's golf team now finds itself in
danger of missing the cut at the
NCAA Championships in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
The Cardinal was just six-over
par at the Bermuda Run Golf
Course yesterday after 15 holes,
but then gave up seven strokes in
the last three holes, including five
on the 18th, to finish the round at
301.
Stanford's 36-hole total of 608
leaves it in 27th place for the
second day in a row. Today, the
Cardinal must move up into at
least a tie for 20th place or it will
have to end its play a day early.
"Tomorrow we need to play a
good round — low to middle 290s
— to make the cut," Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf said.
Oklahoma State, shooting a
four-under-par 284 as a team yes
terday, leapfrogged over three
teams to take the tournament lead
at 573. Oklahoma and Wake For
est, co-leaders Wednesday, are in
second and third at 575 and 576,
respectively.
Miami fell from second to a
fourth-place tie with Houston at
582, with Brigham Young a shot
behind them. Both Cougar teams
were out of the top 10 after Wed
nesday's play.
"1 think the course played a
little tougher today," Schaaf said.

"A lot of the top teams are begin
ning to show (their strength)."
OSU's Scott Verplank, whom
Sports Illustrated said this week
will be the most heralded rookie to
join the pro tour since Jack Nick
laus, leads the individuals by a
wide margin. His second straight
68 on the par-72 course leaves
him at 136, four shots ahead of
Oklahoma's Doug Martin.
Georgia Tech's Nacho Gervas,
OSU's E.J Fisher and Oregon's
George Daves are tied for third at
142. After 10 golfers who are
knotted at 143 comes Stanford's
Don Walsworth, tied for 16th
at 144,
Walsworth stroked a two
under-par 70 yesterday to almost
insure himself of continuing in the
nationals regardless of Stanford's
team performance. Like the team,
he must finish today in no worse
than 20th place to play Saturday,
if the team is eliminated.
Carl Wagner shot 76 but
bogeyed the last two holes, putting
him at 153.
"Hopefully Don will continue to
do well individually, and we'll
move up as a team," Schaaf said.
"Carl's golf was much improved
today. He was playing reasonably
well until the last hole."
Brad Geer also struggled at the
end, bogeying three of the last
four holes to finish at 78 and give
him 154 for the two days. Phil
Rowley and Roger Miraglia are
both at 160, Rowley shooting a 77
yesterday, Miraglia producing his
second straight 80.
