# Women still out of top 10, but only eight strokes from 5th after 36 holes

Following a pattern it hits had most of the season, the
Stanford women's golf team improved from a poor start
yesterday to an 1 lth-place tie after the second round of
the NCAA Championships in Columbus, Ohio.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal's round of 310 was 10
swings better than Wednesday's opening round. Stanford
is now tied with Kentucky at 610, 20 strokes behind co
leaders Miami and Florida. But though Stanford only
moved up one notch in the standings, it is only eight cuts
out of the top five.
"Eight shots isn't much for a team in team competi
tion," Stanford's Kay Cornelius said. "Starting off so
poorly as we did, yes, it's really hard to move up. We
never started off this year at a tournament where we were
right in the hunt right away â€” we're always fighting to
move up. Hopefully, we'll move up in the next couple of
days."
Top-ranked Florida had the day's second-best round,
293, to tie the surprising No. 14 Hurricanes for the lead.
USC had the day's top round, 291, in rising from sixth to
third place at 596, six off the pace. '
Ninth-ranked Southern Methodist fell from second to
fourth place at 599, while No. 3 San Jose State and No. 6
Louisiana State are knotted at 603.
The Cardinal is not the only highly ranked team having
its share of trouble. Second-ranked Tulsa is in eighth
place, just four strokes ahead of Stanford.
The individual leader board saw a major shuffle yester
day, as only two of Wednesday's top seven, South
Florida's Lori Kean and SMU's Martha Foyer, remained
there yesterday. Florida's Page Dunlop currently leads at
143, with Kean and Miami's Joy McAvoy at 144.
Foyer and UCLA's Kay Cockerill are tied for fourth at
145, with Bruin Krystal Parker and Arizona's Michelle
Estrill tied for sixth a stroke behind them.
Stanford's Julie Carmichael fired a one-over-par 74 on
the 6,200-yard Scarlet Golf Course to give her a two-day
total of 149, tops on the squad. Cornelius duplicated Car
michael's effort yesterday, leaving her at 152.
