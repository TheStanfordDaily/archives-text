# A
						lofty idealist and an animal
## Dreamer Atkinson gunning for Myers at NCAA meet 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
For Stanford senior Jeff Atkinson
the challenge has been set. Last
weekend at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Atkinson finished
second in the 1,500 meters â€” a great
finish by anyone's standards, but not
quite enough for Atkinson.
Atkinson calls himself a dreamer,
but that doesn't mean quite what one
might expect, because to Atkinson
dreams aren't something floating
aimlessly in the back of one's head.
They are something to strive for, con
stant landmarks by which one checks
his progress. Atkinson could even be
called a dreamer with a cause.
"You've got to forge some realities
out of your dreams," he said. "The
minute you put limits on yourself,
they're yours. You go with the flow
and hopefully the flow will take you
where you want to go.
"If not now, when? If not all-out,
why?," Atkinson said.
Sounds a little poetic, maybe a little
bit sappy, maybe a little offbeat, but
that's Atkinson, and that's sincere.
Atkinson is a fierce competitor, but
he's also a nice guy. Maybe a little
aloof, but that's just the visionary
shining through.
"I have this dumb theory that says
man is a lofty idealist and an animal.
You've got to have both to be human.
The idea is to get the animal out in a
competitive environment."
Atkinson has what you might call
vision, and right now that vision is
centered on the NCAA Champion

ships. After losing to his rival from
Oregon, Dub Myers, at the Pac-10
meet, Atkinson is preparing for an
other shot at the NCAAs, which will
be held June 4-7 in Indianapolis.
"He's (Myers) the man to beat.
The challenge has been set and now it
has to be conquered. We've been
holding back. Hopefully now we'll
bring it around. If it was easy, eveiy
one would do it," Atkinson said.
By holding back Atkinson means
that he and Coach Brooks Johnson
haven't done all the speed work ne
cessary for Atkinson's kick. Johnson
had decided that it was better to take
the safe route and not tempt injury by
doing all the sprints that tough speed
work requires.
"He ran a very good race. His not
finishing first was not a lack of his tal
ent. I just didn't want to get him
hurt," Johnson said.
Whether or not Johnson's move
was the right one is anyone's guess,
but one thing is certain. Johnson
could not afford to have Atkinson
hurt, for Atkinson's role as a leader
was crucial to this year's squad. Both
on last fall's Pac-10 champion cross
country team and this year's track
squad, Atkinson served as a role
model for the other athletes to follow.
"My style is by example. I tiy not
to get too uptight. Hopefully people
will see me as relaxed and confident
and do the same." Atkinson said.
All that seems to be true, but ac
cording to Johnson, Atkinson does
even more. "He's a bit modest. He's

"The challenge has been set and now it has to be conquered," Jeff At
kinson said of his upcoming NCAA duel with Oregon's Dub Myers in
the 1,500 meters.
