# A 						lofty idealist and an animal
## Dreamer Atkinson gunning for Myers at NCAA meet 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
For Stanford senior Jeff Atkinson
the challenge has been set. Last
weekend at the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, Atkinson finished
second in the 1,500 meters — a great
finish by anyone's standards, but not
quite enough for Atkinson.
Atkinson calls himself a dreamer,
but that doesn't mean quite what one
might expect, because to Atkinson
dreams aren't something floating
aimlessly in the back of one's head.
They are something to strive for, con
stant landmarks by which one checks
his progress. Atkinson could even be
called a dreamer with a cause.
"You've got to forge some realities
out of your dreams," he said. "The
minute you put limits on yourself,
they're yours. You go with the flow
and hopefully the flow will take you
where you want to go.
"If not now, when? If not all-out,
why?," Atkinson said.
Sounds a little poetic, maybe a little
bit sappy, maybe a little offbeat, but
that's Atkinson, and that's sincere.
Atkinson is a fierce competitor, but
he's also a nice guy. Maybe a little
aloof, but that's just the visionary
shining through.
"I have this dumb theory that says
man is a lofty idealist and an animal.
You've got to have both to be human.
The idea is to get the animal out in a
competitive environment."
Atkinson has what you might call
vision, and right now that vision is
centered on the NCAA Champion

ships. After losing to his rival from
Oregon, Dub Myers, at the Pac-10
meet, Atkinson is preparing for an
other shot at the NCAAs, which will
be held June 4-7 in Indianapolis.
"He's (Myers) the man to beat.
The challenge has been set and now it
has to be conquered. We've been
holding back. Hopefully now we'll
bring it around. If it was easy, eveiy
one would do it," Atkinson said.
By holding back Atkinson means
that he and Coach Brooks Johnson
haven't done all the speed work ne
cessary for Atkinson's kick. Johnson
had decided that it was better to take
the safe route and not tempt injury by
doing all the sprints that tough speed
work requires.
"He ran a very good race. His not
finishing first was not a lack of his tal
ent. I just didn't want to get him
hurt," Johnson said.
Whether or not Johnson's move
was the right one is anyone's guess,
but one thing is certain. Johnson
could not afford to have Atkinson
hurt, for Atkinson's role as a leader
was crucial to this year's squad. Both
on last fall's Pac-10 champion cross
country team and this year's track
squad, Atkinson served as a role
model for the other athletes to follow.
"My style is by example. I tiy not
to get too uptight. Hopefully people
will see me as relaxed and confident
and do the same." Atkinson said.
All that seems to be true, but ac
cording to Johnson, Atkinson does
even more. "He's a bit modest. He's

not a very subtle leader. He lays it on
the line and everybody follows,"
Johnson said. "He acts as a buffer be
tween me and some of the team. He
takes the bite out of me a little bit."
Atkinson does a lot for the Stan
ford track team, but it hasn't always
been that way. When he first came to
the Farm, Atkinson was looking for
something else.
He went through a sort of progres
sion in which he figured out what he
wanted to do. While his times im
proved — Atkinson has taken taken
20 seconds off his mile time since
coming to Stanford — so did, as
Johnson sees it, his personality.
"He used to try and bring attention
to himself through loud decibels and
loud clothing, now he draws it
through his performances and his
competitive character," Johnson said.
"He used to try and be a character.
Now, he has character.
"He's improved and developed as a
person. He's successful in both his
personality and his performances.
That's what college athletics is all

about," Johnson added.
In June. Atkinson will graduate as
the Stanford school record holder at
1.500 meters and from there he
plans, while pursuing an interest in
filmmaking on the side, to become a
full-time runner for at least two years.
After two years of open competition,
Atkinson plans to review his progress
and go from there.
If all goes as planned, Atkinson
would like to remain in the Palo Alto
area and continue to train under
Johnson.
When asked how he'd like to be
remembered by his teammates, Atkin
son said, "I'd like to be remembered
as someone who may not have it all
together and may not have all the
answers, but who is never held back
by anything."
For the immediate future, Atkin
son is plotting his strategy for the
NCAA 1,500. The editors of Track
and Field News have him picked for
10th, but Atkinson doesn't buy it.
With a bit of a smile, Atkinson said
that Track and Field News is "in for a
surprise." He didn't like being ranked
10th, because, as he says, "as soon as
you set limits they're yours."
