# On the road with the Stanford police

The burglar alarm had just been
triggered in a Town and Country Vil
lage store. "Let's 1080," the Stanford
police officer says as he runs to his
patrol car.

Keith Viveiros wants to move into
position in case his assistance is re
quired. He parks along the road
across from the mall.
Deciphering the heavily coded jar
gon issuing from the police radio,
Viveiros explains that the police are
attempting to locate the store where
the potential robbery may be taking
place. After the store is found, the
police will "park a building or so
away and sneak up."
The alarm turns out to be false.
As the alarm indicates, police work
is often reactionary: officers must
spend a large amount of their time on
duty simply waiting for something to

happen.
"That's why police have more
heart attacks than other people,"
Viveiros says. "You just wait for the
bell to go off."
Married May 17, today (May 23) is
Viveiros' first day back on the job
after a week-long honeymoon. At 25,
Viveiros has been with the Stanford
Police Department for five years.
As he has to catch up on his paper
work, Viveiros begins his patrol at
2:30 p.m. by heading for the Wilbur
parking lot. A dark blue car passes
Viveiros as he pulls into the lot. He
stops and looks at the car, writing
down its license plate number on a
notepad connected to the dash board.
Since he does not recognize the car,
Viveiros wants to record its number
in case a crime is committed today in
the nearby area. That way, if a dark
blue car is seen leaving the scene of
the crime, he will "know who he is."
Viveiros marks down the number
of 10 to 15 "suspicious" cars a day.
Completing some necessary paper
work, Viveiros leaves the Wilbur
parking lot and heads out along
Campus Drive. According to
