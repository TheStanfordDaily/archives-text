# On the road with the Stanford police

The burglar alarm had just been
triggered in a Town and Country Vil
lage store. "Let's 1080," the Stanford
police officer says as he runs to his
patrol car.

Keith Viveiros wants to move into
position in case his assistance is re
quired. He parks along the road
across from the mall.
Deciphering the heavily coded jar
gon issuing from the police radio,
Viveiros explains that the police are
attempting to locate the store where
the potential robbery may be taking
place. After the store is found, the
police will "park a building or so
away and sneak up."
The alarm turns out to be false.
As the alarm indicates, police work
is often reactionary: officers must
spend a large amount of their time on
duty simply waiting for something to

happen.
"That's why police have more
heart attacks than other people,"
Viveiros says. "You just wait for the
bell to go off."
Married May 17, today (May 23) is
Viveiros' first day back on the job
after a week-long honeymoon. At 25,
Viveiros has been with the Stanford
Police Department for five years.
As he has to catch up on his paper
work, Viveiros begins his patrol at
2:30 p.m. by heading for the Wilbur
parking lot. A dark blue car passes
Viveiros as he pulls into the lot. He
stops and looks at the car, writing
down its license plate number on a
notepad connected to the dash board.
Since he does not recognize the car,
Viveiros wants to record its number
in case a crime is committed today in
the nearby area. That way, if a dark
blue car is seen leaving the scene of
the crime, he will "know who he is."
Viveiros marks down the number
of 10 to 15 "suspicious" cars a day.
Completing some necessary paper
work, Viveiros leaves the Wilbur
parking lot and heads out along
Campus Drive. According to
Viveiros, the Stanford police have no formal
routine for patrolling. However, they do try
to visit every street on campus at least
several times a day.
After an hour of driving, Viveiros spots
two 12-year-olds riding their bicycles
through a stop sign. "Children, children,
children," he says as he halts them in a
nearby parking lot. Viverios picks up his
ticket book and gets out to "chat" with the
two.
Although he decides not to give the
children tickets, Viveiros says with a chuckle
that he did "verbally abuse them." He adds
that he does feel the two will be more care
ful next time.
As he pulls out of the parking lot,
Viveiros sees another bicyclist ride through
a stop sign. Following him, Viveiros watches
the rider pedal through two red lights. "This
one's getting a ticket," Viveiros says.

The 17-year-old rider explains that he
reads for an old blind man and that he was
on his way there when Viveiros stopped
him. The teenager says he is paid $4 an hour
for reading.
After explaining that tickets for all three
infractions would cost the youth over $ 100,
Viveiros says he will only fine the youth for
not having a bicycle license. The fine will
cost the teenager only $4.
The ticket will "cost him a little time and a
little money, but I think he'll learn a lesson," 1
Viveiros says.
Minutes later, on Junipero Serra
Boulevard, a white BMW speeds past
Viveiros' car in a bicycle only lane, turning
right at a red light. Viveiros soon pulls the
car over to the side of the road.
"I'm going to ticket this guy and I don't
care what he says," Viveiros promises as he
gets out of his patrol car.
As he passes the rear fender of the car,
Viveiros pops the snap holding his gun in its
holster. Standing slightly behind the driver
side window of the car, Viveiros asks the

driver for some identification.
While the driver searches his glove com
partment, Viveiros instinctively puts his
hand on the handle of his gun. He relaxes
only after the driver produces his registra
tion.
According to Viveiros, officers are trained
early to take a safe position behind the
driver of the car in case he "pulls something
on you."
"It's just a reflex to put your hand on your
gun and be ready," he says.
The driver could not find his license, a fact
that concerns this policeman. "Something's
up with this guy. He's sweating like a stuffed
pig. I don't know what he's scared about,"
he says.
The police dispatcher informs Viveiros
that the car belongs to the driver. He tickets
the driver for driving in a "bike lane and for
not having his license.
Viveiros decides the driver was anxious
because "he probably has never gotten a
ticket before."
"People get so nervous around
cops. It's like we don't go home at
night, eat dinner and go to bed like
everyone else," he says. "We're not
superhuman. It's crazy."
Noting that today has been
"exceptionally slow," Viveiros is
quick to stress that Stanford police do
more than hand out tickets.
"Everything we do out here has the
potential to be dangerous."
"We come out here to do police
work," he says, adding that the week
before he left for his honeymoon, he
handled 10 to 15 calls a day."And
they were police calls, and not
parking complaints."
Describing the potential for danger
as no different than in any other sub
urban area, Viveiros says, "We've got
officers who get into fights and
chases. We've got officers that get put
into hospitals and get involved in
shootouts. It happens."
Criminals listed on state-wide
wanted lists pass through campus
every day, Viveiros says. Stanford
police usually catch one of these
criminals a week.
Police weaponry reflects the poten
tial danger inherent in the job. All
patrol cars sport pump shotguns and
every officer carries a Smith and
Wesson .357 magnum hand gun.

Arms are loaded at all times while on
duty.
According to Viveiros, he must pull
his gun out of its holster about once a

day, pointing it at someone once a
year. He has never had to fire his gun
at a suspect.
Viveiros has experienced his share
of danger. Last September, he and

another officer got into a fight with a
drunk driver. Both were injured in
the altercation.
A month later, Viveiros caught a
burglar after a foot chase. During his
years with the Stanford Police, he has
been in seven foot and car chases.
Four years ago, in Hoover Pavilion,
a woman pulled a gun on her doctor
and threatened to kill him. The police
surrounded the pavilion. The woman
came out near Viveiros, running into
a nearby wooded area. She shot her
gun several times, killing herself.
"I was scared," he says.
At 5 p.m., the news of the alarm in
the Town and Country Village store
is given over the police radio.
Viveiros, who had just returned to
the police station, responds.
While this call turns out to be false,
a real robbery is committed only
minutes later at a bank in Palo Alto.
The criminal flees on foot with offi
cers of the PAPD in pursuit.
As with the previous alarm, this
crime occurred within the jurisdiction
of the PAPD. Viveiros again moves
in to provide assistance if it is needed.
Listening intently to the police
radio, Viveiros says that the Palo
Alto police are trying to encircle the
criminal. After 20 minutes, an officer
shrieks that she has spotted the rob
ber. A foot chase ensues and the
criminal is caught.
Camaraderie is high. Back at the

station, Viveiros and the other offi
cers congratulate each other as if they
had just captured the thief.
Although the robbery and chase
were the stuff of most TV police se
ries, Viveiros says such instances are
rare. "It's not like television. It would
take a year for all the things to hap
pen to a real cop as it does in TV.

"I used to think those shows were
really entertaining until I got into
this, and now they're a joke,"
Viveiros says.
"Exciting" events are only a small
percentage of a police officer's job.
Mundane responsibilities such as
filing reports are time-consuming re
quirements. In the case of the rob

bery, Viveiros estimated that "now
that the excitement's over, they (the
PAPD) have got at least 10 hours of
paperwork ahead of them."
According to Viveiros, being a
police officer is "not an easy job."
However, he says he loves his work.
"I can't imagine anything else I'd
rather do."

Viveiros routinely handles 10 to 15 calls per day. In this case, however, he was content to let the suspect off
with a little "verbal abuse."

not having a bicycle license. The fine will
cost the teenager only $4.
The ticket will "cost him a little time and a
little money, but I think he'll learn a lesson," 1
Viveiros says.
Minutes later, on Junipero Serra
Boulevard, a white BMW speeds past
Viveiros' car in a bicycle only lane, turning
right at a red light. Viveiros soon pulls the
car over to the side of the road.
"I'm going to ticket this guy and I don't
care what he says," Viveiros promises as he
gets out of his patrol car.
As he passes the rear fender of the car,
Viveiros pops the snap holding his gun in its
holster. Standing slightly behind the driver
side window of the car, Viveiros asks the

driver for some identification.
While the driver searches his glove com
partment, Viveiros instinctively puts his
hand on the handle of his gun. He relaxes
only after the driver produces his registra
tion.
According to Viveiros, officers are trained
early to take a safe position behind the
driver of the car in case he "pulls something
on you."
"It's just a reflex to put your hand on your
gun and be ready," he says.
The driver could not find his license, a fact
that concerns this policeman. "Something's
up with this guy. He's sweating like a stuffed
pig. I don't know what he's scared about,"
he says.
The police dispatcher informs Viveiros
that the car belongs to the driver. He tickets
the driver for driving in a "bike lane and for
not having his license.
Viveiros decides the driver was anxious
because "he probably has never gotten a
ticket before."
"People get so nervous around
cops. It's like we don't go home at
night, eat dinner and go to bed like
everyone else," he says. "We're not
superhuman. It's crazy."
Noting that today has been
"exceptionally slow," Viveiros is
quick to stress that Stanford police do
more than hand out tickets.
"Everything we do out here has the
potential to be dangerous."
"We come out here to do police
work," he says, adding that the week
before he left for his honeymoon, he
handled 10 to 15 calls a day."And
they were police calls, and not
parking complaints."
Describing the potential for danger
as no different than in any other sub
urban area, Viveiros says, "We've got
officers who get into fights and
chases. We've got officers that get put
into hospitals and get involved in
shootouts. It happens."
Criminals listed on state-wide
wanted lists pass through campus
every day, Viveiros says. Stanford
police usually catch one of these
criminals a week.

tial danger inherent in the job. All

day, pointing it at someone once a
year. He has never had to fire his gun
at a suspect.
Viveiros has experienced his share
of danger. Last September, he and

another officer got into a fight with a
drunk driver. Both were injured in
the altercation.
A month later, Viveiros caught a
burglar after a foot chase. During his
years with the Stanford Police, he has
been in seven foot and car chases.
Four years ago, in Hoover Pavilion,
a woman pulled a gun on her doctor
and threatened to kill him. The police
surrounded the pavilion. The woman
came out near Viveiros, running into
a nearby wooded area. She shot her
gun several times, killing herself.
"I was scared," he says.
At 5 p.m., the news of the alarm in
the Town and Country Village store
is given over the police radio.
Viveiros, who had just returned to
the police station, responds.
While this call turns out to be false,
a real robbery is committed only
minutes later at a bank in Palo Alto.
The criminal flees on foot with offi
cers of the PAPD in pursuit.
As with the previous alarm, this
crime occurred within the jurisdiction
of the PAPD. Viveiros again moves
in to provide assistance if it is needed.
Listening intently to the police
radio, Viveiros says that the Palo
Alto police are trying to encircle the
criminal. After 20 minutes, an officer
shrieks that she has spotted the rob
ber. A foot chase ensues and the
criminal is caught.
Camaraderie is high. Back at the

station, Viveiros and the other offi
cers congratulate each other as if they
had just captured the thief.
Although the robbery and chase
were the stuff of most TV police se
ries, Viveiros says such instances are
rare. "It's not like television. It would
take a year for all the things to hap
pen to a real cop as it does in TV.

"I used to think those shows were
really entertaining until I got into
this, and now they're a joke,"
Viveiros says.
"Exciting" events are only a small
percentage of a police officer's job.
Mundane responsibilities such as
filing reports are time-consuming re
quirements. In the case of the rob

bery, Viveiros estimated that "now
that the excitement's over, they (the
PAPD) have got at least 10 hours of
paperwork ahead of them."
According to Viveiros, being a
police officer is "not an easy job."
However, he says he loves his work.
"I can't imagine anything else I'd
rather do."

Viveiros routinely handles 10 to 15 calls per day. In this case, however, he was content to let the suspect off
with a little "verbal abuse."
The burglar alarm had just been
triggered in a Town and Country Vil

Keith Viveiros wants to move into
position in case his assistance is re
quired. He parks along the road
across from the mall.
Deciphering the heavily coded jar
gon issuing from the police radio,
Viveiros explains that the police are
attempting to locate the store where
the potential robbery may be taking
place. After the store is found, the
police will "park a building or so
away and sneak up."
The alarm turns out to be false.
As the alarm indicates, police work
is often reactionary: officers must
spend a large amount of their time on
duty simply waiting for something to

happen.
"That's why police have more
heart attacks than other people,"
Viveiros says. "You just wait for the
bell to go off."
Married May 17, today (May 23) is
Viveiros' first day back on the job
after a week-long honeymoon. At 25,
Viveiros has been with the Stanford
Police Department for five years.
As he has to catch up on his paper
work, Viveiros begins his patrol at
2:30 p.m. by heading for the Wilbur
parking lot. A dark blue car passes
Viveiros as he pulls into the lot. He
stops and looks at the car, writing
down its license plate number on a
notepad connected to the dash board.
Since he does not recognize the car,
Viveiros wants to record its number
in case a crime is committed today in
the nearby area. That way, if a dark
blue car is seen leaving the scene of
the crime, he will "know who he is."
Viveiros marks down the number
of 10 to 15 "suspicious" cars a day.
Completing some necessary paper
work, Viveiros leaves the Wilbur
parking lot and heads out along
Campus Drive. According to
Viveiros, the Stanford police have no formal
routine for patrolling. However, they do try
to visit every street on campus at least
several times a day.
After an hour of driving, Viveiros spots
two 12-year-olds riding their bicycles
through a stop sign. "Children, children,
children," he says as he halts them in a
nearby parking lot. Viverios picks up his
ticket book and gets out to "chat" with the
two.
Although he decides not to give the
children tickets, Viveiros says with a chuckle
that he did "verbally abuse them." He adds
that he does feel the two will be more care
ful next time.
As he pulls out of the parking lot,
Viveiros sees another bicyclist ride through
a stop sign. Following him, Viveiros watches
the rider pedal through two red lights. "This
one's getting a ticket," Viveiros says.

The 17-year-old rider explains that he
reads for an old blind man and that he was
on his way there when Viveiros stopped
him. The teenager says he is paid $4 an hour
for reading.
After explaining that tickets for all three
infractions would cost the youth over $ 100,
Viveiros says he will only fine the youth for
not having a bicycle license. The fine will
cost the teenager only $4.
The ticket will "cost him a little time and a

day, pointing it at someone once a
year. He has never had to fire his gun
at a suspect.
Viveiros has experienced his share
of danger. Last September, he and

another officer got into a fight with a
drunk driver. Both were injured in
the altercation.
A month later, Viveiros caught a
burglar after a foot chase. During his
years with the Stanford Police, he has
been in seven foot and car chases.
Four years ago, in Hoover Pavilion,
a woman pulled a gun on her doctor
and threatened to kill him. The police
surrounded the pavilion. The woman
came out near Viveiros, running into
a nearby wooded area. She shot her
gun several times, killing herself.
"I was scared," he says.
At 5 p.m., the news of the alarm in
the Town and Country Village store
is given over the police radio.
Viveiros, who had just returned to
the police station, responds.
While this call turns out to be false,
a real robbery is committed only
minutes later at a bank in Palo Alto.
The criminal flees on foot with offi
cers of the PAPD in pursuit.
As with the previous alarm, this
crime occurred within the jurisdiction
of the PAPD. Viveiros again moves
in to provide assistance if it is needed.
Listening intently to the police
radio, Viveiros says that the Palo
Alto police are trying to encircle the
criminal. After 20 minutes, an officer
shrieks that she has spotted the rob
ber. A foot chase ensues and the
criminal is caught.
Camaraderie is high. Back at the

station, Viveiros and the other offi
cers congratulate each other as if they
had just captured the thief.
Although the robbery and chase
were the stuff of most TV police se
ries, Viveiros says such instances are
rare. "It's not like television. It would
take a year for all the things to hap
pen to a real cop as it does in TV.

"I used to think those shows were
really entertaining until I got into
this, and now they're a joke,"
Viveiros says.
"Exciting" events are only a small
percentage of a police officer's job.
Mundane responsibilities such as
filing reports are time-consuming re
quirements. In the case of the rob

bery, Viveiros estimated that "now
that the excitement's over, they (the
PAPD) have got at least 10 hours of
paperwork ahead of them."
According to Viveiros, being a
police officer is "not an easy job."
However, he says he loves his work.
"I can't imagine anything else I'd
rather do."

Viveiros routinely handles 10 to 15 calls per day. In this case, however, he was content to let the suspect off
with a little "verbal abuse."
The burglar alarm had just been
triggered in a Town and Country Vil
lage store. "Let's 1080," the Stanford
police officer says as he runs to his
patrol car.

Keith Viveiros wants to move into
position in case his assistance is re
quired. He parks along the road
across from the mall.
Deciphering the heavily coded jar
gon issuing from the police radio,
Viveiros explains that the police are
attempting to locate the store where
the potential robbery may be taking
place. After the store is found, the
police will "park a building or so
away and sneak up."
The alarm turns out to be false.
As the alarm indicates, police work
is often reactionary: officers must
spend a large amount of their time on
duty simply waiting for something to

happen.
"That's why police have more
heart attacks than other people,"
Viveiros says. "You just wait for the
bell to go off."
Married May 17, today (May 23) is
Viveiros' first day back on the job
after a week-long honeymoon. At 25,
Viveiros has been with the Stanford
Police Department for five years.
As he has to catch up on his paper
work, Viveiros begins his patrol at
2:30 p.m. by heading for the Wilbur
parking lot. A dark blue car passes
Viveiros as he pulls into the lot. He
stops and looks at the car, writing
down its license plate number on a
notepad connected to the dash board.
Since he does not recognize the car,
Viveiros wants to record its number
in case a crime is committed today in
the nearby area. That way, if a dark
blue car is seen leaving the scene of
the crime, he will "know who he is."
Viveiros marks down the number
of 10 to 15 "suspicious" cars a day.
Completing some necessary paper
work, Viveiros leaves the Wilbur
parking lot and heads out along
Campus Drive. According to
Viveiros, the Stanford police have no formal
routine for patrolling. However, they do try
to visit every street on campus at least
several times a day.
After an hour of driving, Viveiros spots
two 12-year-olds riding their bicycles
through a stop sign. "Children, children,
children," he says as he halts them in a
nearby parking lot. Viverios picks up his
ticket book and gets out to "chat" with the
two.
Although he decides not to give the
children tickets, Viveiros says with a chuckle
that he did "verbally abuse them." He adds
that he does feel the two will be more care
ful next time.
As he pulls out of the parking lot,
Viveiros sees another bicyclist ride through
a stop sign. Following him, Viveiros watches
the rider pedal through two red lights. "This
one's getting a ticket," Viveiros says.

The 17-year-old rider explains that he
reads for an old blind man and that he was
on his way there when Viveiros stopped
him. The teenager says he is paid $4 an hour
for reading.
After explaining that tickets for all three
infractions would cost the youth over $ 100,
Viveiros says he will only fine the youth for
not having a bicycle license. The fine will
cost the teenager only $4.
The ticket will "cost him a little time and a
little money, but I think he'll learn a lesson," 1
Viveiros says.
Minutes later, on Junipero Serra
Boulevard, a white BMW speeds past
Viveiros' car in a bicycle only lane, turning
right at a red light. Viveiros soon pulls the
car over to the side of the road.
"I'm going to ticket this guy and I don't
care what he says," Viveiros promises as he
gets out of his patrol car.
As he passes the rear fender of the car,
Viveiros pops the snap holding his gun in its
holster. Standing slightly behind the driver
side window of the car, Viveiros asks the

driver for some identification.
While the driver searches his glove com
partment, Viveiros instinctively puts his
hand on the handle of his gun. He relaxes
only after the driver produces his registra
tion.
According to Viveiros, officers are trained
early to take a safe position behind the
driver of the car in case he "pulls something
on you."
"It's just a reflex to put your hand on your
gun and be ready," he says.
The driver could not find his license, a fact
that concerns this policeman. "Something's
up with this guy. He's sweating like a stuffed
pig. I don't know what he's scared about,"
he says.
The police dispatcher informs Viveiros
that the car belongs to the driver. He tickets
the driver for driving in a "bike lane and for
not having his license.
Viveiros decides the driver was anxious
because "he probably has never gotten a
ticket before."
"People get so nervous around
cops. It's like we don't go home at
night, eat dinner and go to bed like
everyone else," he says. "We're not
superhuman. It's crazy."
Noting that today has been
"exceptionally slow," Viveiros is
quick to stress that Stanford police do
more than hand out tickets.
"Everything we do out here has the
potential to be dangerous."
"We come out here to do police
work," he says, adding that the week
before he left for his honeymoon, he
handled 10 to 15 calls a day."And
they were police calls, and not
parking complaints."
Describing the potential for danger
as no different than in any other sub
urban area, Viveiros says, "We've got
officers who get into fights and
chases. We've got officers that get put
into hospitals and get involved in
shootouts. It happens."
Criminals listed on state-wide
wanted lists pass through campus
every day, Viveiros says. Stanford
police usually catch one of these
criminals a week.
Police weaponry reflects the poten
tial danger inherent in the job. All
patrol cars sport pump shotguns and
every officer carries a Smith and
Wesson .357 magnum hand gun.

Arms are loaded at all times while on
duty.
According to Viveiros, he must pull
his gun out of its holster about once a

"People get so
nervous around
cops. It's like we
don't go home at
night, eat dinner
and go to bed like
everyone else.
We're not super
human."
