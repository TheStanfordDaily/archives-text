BOSTON (AP) â€” The Boston Celtics hit a rare cold
spell so Larry Bird decided it wouldn't hurt for basket
ball's best player to try to end it. His hot hand pushed the
Houston Rockets closer to the end of their season.
One day after winning his third consecutive NBA Most
Valuable Player award. Bird exploded in the third quarter
last night and Houston never could put the pieces back to
gether.
The Celtics crushed the Rockets 117-95. The team that
knocked off the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers
4-1 to get to the NBA finals returns home for Game 3
Sunday with a 2-0 deficit in the best-of-seven champion
ship round.
"If a team is playing well, they could play five games in
Edmonton and it wouldn't make a difference," Boston
forward Kevin McHale said.
Boston cruised to its 40th consecutive home victory last
night on the strength of a 34-19 third period that turned a
60-50 halftime lead into a 25-point advantage that grew
to as much as 27 in the final quarter.
"We went out (in the second half) and missed three
shots and we didn't get up and down the court very well,
and they cut it down to eight." said Bird, who led all
scorers with 31 points. "From then on, 1 said to myself,
'you might as well start shooting the ball and see what

happens.' "
Leading 64-56. Boston went on an 11-1 run. which
Bird capped with a three-point field goal and a long
jumper. He also had a steal and a line-drive assist to set up
a Robert Parish layup in that stretch.
"I thought we stopped him up to the third quarter,"
Houston Coach Bill Fitch said. "Then he got into one of
those playing in his own hack yard' situations, where he is
in his own world and it seems like he is out there on his
own. When he gets going like that, he's awesome."
"His hands were on every ball, stealing, rebounding,
passing and shooting." Celtics' center Bill Walton said.
" He could do anything he wanted to tonight."
Boston established a championship series record by hit
ting 23 of 24 free throws for a .958 percentage. The
Lakers set the old mark of .943 when they made 33 of 35
shots at Philadelphia on May 16, 1980.
Thursday night s game was played in 90-degree tem
peratures in the Boston Garden, which has no air condi
tioning.
Houston was led by Akeem Olajuwon with 21 points
and Ralph Sampson with 18. but the Twin Towers
combined for just seven second-half points. One starting
guard, Robert Reid. had eight points and the other. Lewis
Lloyd, just six.
