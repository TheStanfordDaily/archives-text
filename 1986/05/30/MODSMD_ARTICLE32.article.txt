# Indy 500 set for Saturday
## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Almost
forgotten amid the frustration of rain,
mud, two postponements, a squabble
over practice time and a massive
cleanup is that nothing about the cars
nor the drivers in the Indianapolis
500 has really changed.
Hundreds of thousands of fans
departed soggy and disappointed
when rain washed out the scheduled
race last weekend. Most of those will
be back tomorrow to see what still is
the fastest lineup in auto racing his
tory.
The 33 starters averaged a record
210.279 mph in qualifications, more
than two miles an hour faster than the
record set last year. Seven former
winners, including record-setting pole
starter Rick Mears and defending
champion Danny Sullivan, are in the
lineup.
Unless there are further rain
delays, the 70th running of the 500 is
set to begin at noon (EDT) tomor
row. Official standings will be posted
by US AC at 8 a.m. on Sunday.
