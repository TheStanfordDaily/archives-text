After Schofield's blast, reliever Willie Hernan
dez shut out California the rest of the way, and
LaPoint raised his record to 2-3, with both vic
tories coming against the Angels.
Detroit's fifth straight triumph also helped
erase LaPoint's memories of Anaheim Stadium.
As a rookie with Milwaukee in late 1980, he got
shelled in his only previous appearance there.
"That first time, I faced seven batters and got
only one of them them out — Rod Carew,"
LaPoint recalled. "I was out of there before my
wife could get to her seat."
