Chernobyl death toll climbs to 23
MOSCOW — The death toll in the Chernobyl nuclear accident has
climbed to 23, and "a small number of additional fatalities" are ex
pected, American bone marrow transplant specialist Robert Gale said
yesterday.
The latest figures represent an increase of four from the previous total
announced Monday at a news conference and include 21 deaths from ra
diation and two from the original explosion and fire, the UCLA doctor
said.
The official Novosti news agency said that 80 persons flown to Mos
cow hospitals after the world's worst nuclear disaster were still danger
ously ill.
Meantime, a leading Soviet physician said in Cologne, West Germany,
that 11 persons who received bone marrow transplants later died despite
the emergency procedure. The report came from Dr. Yevgeny Chazov, a
deputy health minister.
Gale, who came to Moscow to help treat Chernobyl victims, said that
he would go to the plant site Monday to make a preliminary appraisal of
the long-term consequences of the accident.
He also said that he hoped to negotiate an agreement for Soviet-
American cooperation on a long-term follow-up on individuals exposed
to radioactivity when the Chernobyl reactor, in the Ukraine, exploded
April 26.
While acknowledging that he cannot speak for the U.S. government,
Gale said in a telephone interview that he hoped to obtain the coopera
tion of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institutes of
Health in the project.
Gale said that he had been told by Soviet authorities that 1,000 people
in the Chernobyl area were examined after the accident. Of that total, he
said, 300 were identified its high-risk cases and 250 were flown to Mos
cow, while the remainder went to hospitals in Kiev, capital of the Uk
raine, 60 miles south of Chernobyl.
Contras agree to unify operations
MIAMI — Nicaragua's anti-Sandinista rebels announced agreements
yesterday designed to overcome factional disputes within their organiza
tion and put their guerrilla operations under unified civilian control.
The rebels, known as contras, also announced measures aimed at
countering allegations of corrupt practices and human rights abuses by
their members.
The announcements were part of efforts by the contras to show unity
and probity as Congress considers whether to give them $100 million in
new aid.
The rebel movement has been beset by chronic internal divisions
during more than four years of guerrilla warfare against the Marxist-led
Sandinista government.
In an attempt at unity last year, rebel leaders formed an umbrella or
ganization called United Nicaraguan Opposition, known by its acronym,
UNO, which means "one" in Spanish.
But UNO failed to end the squabbling. Two of its three directors, Ar
turo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo, were frequently at odds with the third,
Adolfo Calero.
Cruz and Robelo are both former Sandinista government officials who
defected. Calero, who opposed the Sandinista government from its
beginning in 1979, is the civilian chief of the Honduran-based
Nicaraguan Democratic Force, by far the largest contra military group.
Yesterday, the three met with the press and said they had reached
agreement on a broad range of issues during more than two weeks of
meetings in Miami.
S. Korea agrees to draft reforms
SEOUL. South Korea — A major breakthrough in efforts to amend
South Korea's repressive Constitution was achieved yesterday when
leaders of the ruling and opposition parties agreed to establish a Na
tional Assembly committee to draft reforms "guaranteeing the people a
free choice of government."
The agreement came at a three-hour dinner meeting attended by Roh
Tae Woo, chairman of the governing Democratic Justice Party, and Lee
Min Woo, head of the opposition New Korea Democratic Party.
It ended six years of refusals by President Chun Doo Hwan to even
consider rewriting the constitution that he imposed under martial law as
acting president in 1980. It also put Chun's party on record as favoring,
if not committed to, constitutional reform.
The agreement was announced by spokesmen for the two parties and
then confirmed by Roh and Lee in separate meetings with newsmen.
Chun had said on April 30 that he would permit reform of the consti
tution in time to select his successor under a new system, but only if the
opposition and ruling parties could reach agreement on the necessary
amendments in the National Assembly.

Chernobyl death toll climbs to 23
MOSCOW — The death toll in the Chernobyl nuclear accident has
climbed to 23, and "a small number of additional fatalities" are ex
pected, American bone marrow transplant specialist Robert Gale said
yesterday.
The latest figures represent an increase of four from the previous total
announced Monday at a news conference and include 21 deaths from ra
diation and two from the original explosion and fire, the UCLA doctor
said.
The official Novosti news agency said that 80 persons flown to Mos
cow hospitals after the world's worst nuclear disaster were still danger
ously ill.
Meantime, a leading Soviet physician said in Cologne, West Germany,
that 11 persons who received bone marrow transplants later died despite
the emergency procedure. The report came from Dr. Yevgeny Chazov, a
deputy health minister.
Gale, who came to Moscow to help treat Chernobyl victims, said that
he would go to the plant site Monday to make a preliminary appraisal of
the long-term consequences of the accident.
He also said that he hoped to negotiate an agreement for Soviet-
American cooperation on a long-term follow-up on individuals exposed
to radioactivity when the Chernobyl reactor, in the Ukraine, exploded
April 26.
While acknowledging that he cannot speak for the U.S. government,
Gale said in a telephone interview that he hoped to obtain the coopera
tion of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institutes of
Health in the project.
Gale said that he had been told by Soviet authorities that 1,000 people
in the Chernobyl area were examined after the accident. Of that total, he
said, 300 were identified its high-risk cases and 250 were flown to Mos
cow, while the remainder went to hospitals in Kiev, capital of the Uk
raine, 60 miles south of Chernobyl.
Contras agree to unify operations
MIAMI — Nicaragua's anti-Sandinista rebels announced agreements
yesterday designed to overcome factional disputes within their organiza
tion and put their guerrilla operations under unified civilian control.
The rebels, known as contras, also announced measures aimed at
countering allegations of corrupt practices and human rights abuses by
their members.
The announcements were part of efforts by the contras to show unity
and probity as Congress considers whether to give them $100 million in
new aid.
The rebel movement has been beset by chronic internal divisions
during more than four years of guerrilla warfare against the Marxist-led
Sandinista government.
In an attempt at unity last year, rebel leaders formed an umbrella or
ganization called United Nicaraguan Opposition, known by its acronym,
UNO, which means "one" in Spanish.
But UNO failed to end the squabbling. Two of its three directors, Ar
turo Cruz and Alfonso Robelo, were frequently at odds with the third,
Adolfo Calero.
Cruz and Robelo are both former Sandinista government officials who
defected. Calero, who opposed the Sandinista government from its
beginning in 1979, is the civilian chief of the Honduran-based
Nicaraguan Democratic Force, by far the largest contra military group.
Yesterday, the three met with the press and said they had reached
agreement on a broad range of issues during more than two weeks of
meetings in Miami.
S. Korea agrees to draft reforms
SEOUL. South Korea — A major breakthrough in efforts to amend
South Korea's repressive Constitution was achieved yesterday when
leaders of the ruling and opposition parties agreed to establish a Na
tional Assembly committee to draft reforms "guaranteeing the people a
free choice of government."
The agreement came at a three-hour dinner meeting attended by Roh
Tae Woo, chairman of the governing Democratic Justice Party, and Lee
Min Woo, head of the opposition New Korea Democratic Party.
It ended six years of refusals by President Chun Doo Hwan to even
consider rewriting the constitution that he imposed under martial law as
acting president in 1980. It also put Chun's party on record as favoring,
if not committed to, constitutional reform.
The agreement was announced by spokesmen for the two parties and
then confirmed by Roh and Lee in separate meetings with newsmen.
Chun had said on April 30 that he would permit reform of the consti
tution in time to select his successor under a new system, but only if the
opposition and ruling parties could reach agreement on the necessary
amendments in the National Assembly.
Iraqi jets strike Iranian troops
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraqi fighter-bombers "exterminated entire
units" of Iranian Revolutionary Guards that had been massing for an as
sault across the Iraqi border, an Iraqi military spokesman said yesterday.

Wednesday night near the southern Iranian border cities of Dezful and
Shush. He said all raiding planes returned safely to base.
The Iraqi government simultaneously sent an urgent message to Javier
Perez de Cuellar, the secretary general of the United Nations, informing
him that Iran was preparing for "an all-out attack on major Iraqi cities."
The communication said that the Iranians had intensified shelling of
border communities on the pretext of Iraqi attacks on civilian areas.
In Tehran, Iraqi soldiers taken prisoner during a ground assault in the
southern Faw peninsula two days ago were quoted as saying that the
Iraqi government was drafting primary and secondary school students in
the armed forces.
