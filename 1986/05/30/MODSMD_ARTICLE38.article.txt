# Shultz says SALT II obsolete

HALIFAX, Nova Scotia — Secretary of State
George Shultz, seeking to ease the anxiety and op
position of America's European allies, said yester
day that the unratified SALT II strategic arms
limitation treaty has ceased to be an effective vehi
cle for averting a U.S.-Soviet nuclear confrontation
and should be replaced by other means.
Speaking at a meeting here of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization foreign ministers, Shultz, in
effect, confirmed to the Europeans that the United
States does not consider itself bound to continue
voluntary adherence to SALT II restraints on the
size of the American nuclear arsenal.
His explanation of the decision announced Tues
day by President Reagan provoked what some par
ticipants in the closed-door meeting described as a
"free-for-all" of heated debate and opposition
from the allies concerned about the negative effects
on Western European public opinion.
These sources, who asked not to be identified,
said the opposition was particularly strong from
Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and Bel
gium — all countries that are deploying U.S.
medium-range nuclear missiles on their territory
despite heavy domestic anti-nuclear pressures.
The sources added that reservations about the
wisdom of the U.S. position were expressed by all
the other members of the 16-nation alliance. One
source said, "If there had been a vote, it would
have been 15-to-1 against the United States."
However, the sources said, Shultz stood firm in
insisting that the U.S. stance was necessary because
Of repeated Soviet violations of the SALT II
restraints and changing assumptions about nuclear
strategy.

The sources said that Shultz expressed the belief
that European fears will be allayed once the
reasons for Reagan's decision are fully and clearly
explained.
Underlying the controversy was the White
House announcement Tuesday that Reagan would
take two Poseidon submarines out of service this
spring, thus keeping the United States under SALT
II limits for intercontinental ballistics missiles.
But the Administration added that in the fall, the
United States would exceed SALT II limits by
deploying new air-launched cruise missiles on B-52

bombers. Although Reagan said that future U.S.
moves would depend on Soviet actions, U.S. offi
cials have described his decision as serving notice of
the Administration's intention to move away from
SALT 11.
Sources here said Shultz argued yesterday that
the United States could not permit itself to be
bound by a treaty that was never ratified by the
Senate and that was supposed to last only for a lim
ited time.
He told the Europeans that Soviet violations
were placing the United States at a strategic disad
vantage and that new concepts of nuclear warfare
had made SALT II obsolete.
The participants said he acknowledged that in
Europe, SALT II has become "a symbol" of super
power restraint whose continuation is considered
necessary for the success of future U.S.-Soviet arms
control talks.
But, the sources said, Shultz argued that the goal
of avoiding nuclear warfare can be served better if
the United States pursues a negotiating strategy
aimed at achieving "mutual restraint" and "radical
reductions" by the two superpowers.
He said that these goals can be pursued through
such avenues as future summit meetings between
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
intensified arms control talks. If such efforts move
forward succesfuliy, he said, the importance of
SALT II will diminish in European opinion.
On the other side, the sources said, the
Europeans countered that the U.S. decision would
be seen in their countries as an American abandon
ment of restraint and reawaken fears that Reagan is
not really interested in arms control.
