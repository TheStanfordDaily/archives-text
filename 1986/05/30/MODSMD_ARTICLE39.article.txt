# Stanford grad linked to larger spying ring

### 
WASHINGTON — Former Navy
analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard, a
former Stanford student whose arrest
in November on charges of spying for
Israel was dismissed by that nation as
an isolated embarrassment, was in
fact one link in an organized and
well-financed Israeli espionage ring
operating within the United States,
knowledgeable government sources
have told the Los Angeles Times.
The sources, speaking on the con
dition that they not be identified, said
that serious doubt has been cast on
Israel's claims that its government
knew nothing of Pollard's activities
and that it had cooperated fully in the
U.S. inquiry of the affair.
Instead, a continuing federal inves

tigation of Israeli spying activities
most likely will produce at least one
additional arrest and has brought
both American and Israeli citizens
under suspicion, according to sources.
The suspects include an unnamed Is
raeli air force official — a regular
visitor to the United States, osten
sibly here for educational purposes —
who is believed to have been the
"master case officer" for U.S. intelli
gence operations, according to offi
cials.
"The Israelis lied to us. This was no
small-time rogue operation: it was
much more systematic than that,"
one official said. "This was a very ex
pensive operation that they ran.
There's no embassy slush fund big
enough to cover that sort of thing."
