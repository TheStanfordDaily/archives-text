# Kennedy: divestment not trivial
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Attempts to "trivialize" Stanford's recent divestment of
almost $10,000 of stock in a company that does business
in South Africa is a "bit of tricky rhetoric," University
President Donald Kennedy told the Faculty Senate yes
terday.
"You count by companies and issues, not by number of
dollars," Kennedy said. "Nobody can propose, I think,
that we only proceed in this business in order by the size
of our investment rather than in the order of the serious
ness of the problem."
In other business, Provost James Rosse addressed con
cerns about possible liability in suits brought against fac
ulty members as a result of serving on University search,
promotion, appointment or review committees.
On May 13, Stanford trustees voted to divest of $9,900
of Newmont Mining stock, the first South Africa-related
divestment by the University. At the meeting, the trustees
also voted to divest of holdings of Diamond Shamrock
stock, valued at $400,000, unless the company follows
through on a promise to dispose of its South African inter
ests by Oct. 1.
The trustees also charged the Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (SCIR) to obtain further infor
mation on the South African policies of Schlumberger, in
which Stanford holds nearly $3.5 million in stock.
The Stanford investment portfolio currently contains
about $ 182 million of stock in 80 companies with business
interests in South Africa.
Although subject to "continuous review," Kennedy
said the position of the trustees is to continue selective di
vestment on a case-by-case basis.
"I do not anticipate that the Board of Trustees will take
on this occasion another new formal review of the possi
bility of a basic change in policy (from) selective divest
ment to blanket or total divestment," Kennedy said.
"However, that is not ever completely out of the con
versation, either within the [SCI R] or the full board dis
cussions that follow the reports of that committee."
Kennedy said he and Warren Christopher, president of
the board, have been in touch with the chief executive of
ficers of companies in Stanford's stock portfolio that do
business in South Africa to discuss their policies.
Together with Harvard University president Derek
Bok, Kennedy has also asked Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chair Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) to review
the effectiveness of the South African economic sanctions
mandated by presidential executive order.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy asked Ken
nedy to explain the principles used by the trustees in its
decision to divest. "It strikes me that the trustees have not
been very forthcoming about (stating) the reasons for
their actions," Abernethy said.
The failure to get any kind of "satisfactory informa
tion" from Newmont about their South African policies
was the primary cause of divestment from that company,
Kennedy said.
"Interestingly, the same problem was clearly identifia
ble in the case of Schlumberger, but what the SCIR was
not satisfied with in that case is that a full opportunity
[was not] given to that company to satisfy that proviso,"
Kennedy said.
Rosse's remarks concerning faculty
liability attempted to alleviate fears
that faculty members would not have
University legal or financial support if
faced with lawsuits similar to that
filed earlier this month by visiting
History Prof. Norman Davies.
In the $3 million suit against Prof.
Harold Kahn and 30 unnamed mem
bers of the History Department,
Davies alleges he was unfairly denied
a vacant endowed position in Eastern
European studies because of his
treatment of Polish-Jewish relations
in a chapter of his book on Poland.
Because activities such as service
on search committees is considered to

be part of a faculty member's job and
professional duty, Rosse said such
service is considered to be an act of
the University.
"If faculty members are sued as a
result of such service, the University
would defend (and) provide legal
services," Rosse said. "In the event of
a judgment against the faculty mem
bers, the University would pay it."
Because the University would pay
any judgment damages, Stanford
does have the right to determine
whether to use its own legal staff or
retain outside counsel, Rosse said.
"Our guiding principle throughout
all the legal complexities is that fac
ulty members performing their Stan
ford duties in a professional and re
sponsible way are entitled to the Uni
versity's advice and assistance."
