### 
BALTIMORE — Three mem
bers of the Delta Upsilon frater
nity at Johns Hopkins University
— one who would have graduated
today — were indicted yesterday
on charges of arson, assault with
intent to murder and conspiracy to
commit arson in connection with a
tire last weekend that injured one
student.
The charges stem from the
gasoline firebombing Saturday
morning of the shanty, which had
been erected by a campus group to
symbolize the living conditions of
blacks in South Africa,
The grand jury heard state
ments from eight witnesses, in

cluding fraternity members who
testified that they overheard dis
cussions of the plans to set the
shanty on fire and heard talk
about the incident afterward, said
Baltimore State's Attorney Kurt
Schmoke.
Johns Hopkins University offi
cials said all three indicted stu
dents would be suspended from
the school until the completion of
an internal hearing.
One of the three students inside
the shanty, Kevin Archer, a uni
versity graduate student and newly
named Fulbright scholar, received
first- and second-degree burns on
his back from the blaze.
