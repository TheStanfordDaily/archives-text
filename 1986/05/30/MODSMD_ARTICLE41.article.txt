Veto may be sustained
WASHINGTON — White House officials,
buoyed by a key Democratic senator's support
and the prospect of a Middle East trip by Secre
tary of State George Shultz, claimed yesterday to
have the 34 votes needed to sustain President
Reagan's veto of a congressional resolution
blocking sales of advanced nissiles to Saudi
Arabia.
A senior White House official said such a trip
could be politically helpful because some
senators would be reluctant to stop the sale,
which Reagan contends would improve U.S. re
lations with moderate Arab states, on the eve of a
Shultz visit to Saudi Arabia.
This official said that, even if Shultz decides
not to go, the Administration believes that it can
uphold the veto, an assessment confirmed by
Sen. Warren Rudman (R-N.H.), an opponent of
the sale.
The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday,
soon after Congress returns from a recess. Dem
ocrats succeeded May 22 in delaying the vote
after Republicans claimed that they could sustain
the veto.
Reagan defends policy
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
defending his trade policy in a speech to

businessmen, disclosed yesterday that the United
States and Japan have reached "the framework
of an agreement" to open Japanese markets to
American-made computer chips and prevent
Japan from "dumping" lower-priced chips in
U.S. and other foreign markets.
At the same time, the president denounced a
House-passed trade bill as "kamikaze legisla
tion" that could "send our economy into the
steepest nose dive since the Great Depression"
and throw millions of Americans out of work.
But Reagan's remarks attracted little applause
from the audience of businessmen affiliated with
the National Association of Manufacturers as he
warned "how dangerous it is to play a game of
chicken with our trading partners — because it
won't be long until we're both driving over that
cliff."
U.S. and Japanese negotiators have been hold
ing discussions on semiconductor trade since late
March. American semiconductor manufacturers
have been seeking greater access to Japan's com
puter chip market, claiming that a cartel backed
by that country's government has held U.S. sales
to about 10 percent of consumption.
Smugglers face charges
WASHINGTON — A retired Israeli general
and four other men appeared before a special
magistrate in Manhattan yesterday on charges
that they participated in an illegal scheme to

smuggle $2.5 billion in American-made
warplanes, missiles and other weapons to Iran.
The men, in custody pending bail hearings
starting today, were extradited to New York
Wednesday from Bermuda. That extradition was
the result of a ruling by the Bermudan Supreme
Court and was the latest development in the larg
est "sting" operation ever run by the U.S. Cus
toms Service.
The alleged scheme, which involved 17 defen
dants and five weapons-smuggling conspiracies,
included arms smugglers and shipping agents
from Israel, West Germany, France, Britain,
Greece and the United States.
Stocks reach new highs
NEW YORK — The stock market edged up
ward yesterday, bouncing back from some early
selling to post record highs for the second straight
session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down more than 10 points at midday, closed with
a 4.07 gain at 1,882.35.
The catalyst for that selling was a rise jn inter
est rates prompted by some stronger-than
expected economic news. The Commerce De
partment reported that its index of leading eco
nomic indicators jumped 1.5 percent in April, for
its largest increase in nearly three years.
