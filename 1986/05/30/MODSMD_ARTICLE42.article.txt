Spy lived decadently
SAN FRANCISCO — A former woman friend
of accused spy Jerry Whitworth testified yester
day he "tended to like a decadent lifestyle" and
that she regarded the espionage charges against
him as disgusting and repulsive.
I he testimony of school resources specialist
Celia Vanderpool of San Clemente came as a
surprise in the midst of several days of prosecu
tion attempts to prove with a dry blizzard of
receipts that Whitworth and his wife had spent
tens of thousands of dollars of Soviet money.
Vanderpool said she was first introduced to
Whitworth in 1978, met Walker once at a 1979
wedding party for the Whitworths, and eventu
ally became good friends with the Whitworths.
As a "financial witness," for the government,
Vanderpool testified about the money Whit
worth had spent freely in the years she knew him,
including that for expensive gifts to her and

$6,600 in two personal loans.
Whitworth, a former Navy radioman, is
accused of working with Walker for nine years,
allegedly passing classified secrets to Walker for
relay to the Soviet Union for $332,000.
Court affirms authority
SAN FRANCISCO — The state Supreme
Court ruled yesterday that a Gilroy vegetable
grower acted in bad faith by refusing to negotiate
with the United Farm Workers, and upheld a key
provision of the Agricultural Labor Relations
Board's (AL RB) process to investigate contested
elections.
Rejecting the grower's challenge, the high
court said the board can appoint hearing officers
to take testimony and make recommendations in
UFW election disputes. The 4-3 decision also up
held the board's financial penalities against
grower Robert Lindeleaf.
Lindeleaf contested the 1980 UFW election at

his farms, where the vote was 7 1 for the union,
35 against and four challenged ballots. The elec
tion was invalid, he claimed, because of alleged
threats by the UFW and misconduct by the
board. Lindeleaf has refused to negotiate a union
contract.
The Suprme Court opinion rejected Lin
deleaf s position and also the appeal judge's
ruling that would have required major changes in
the ALRB's operations.
The opinion said the law was aimed at prevent
ing conflicts of interest by separating ALRB
regional offices, which conduct the elections,
from hearing officers who review the challenges.
