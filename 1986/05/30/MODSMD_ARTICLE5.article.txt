# 3 Rhodes scholars to urge scholarship trust to divest
## 
### BOB MICHITARIAN Senior staff writer 
Three Stanford Rhodes Scholars announced yester
day that they will turn their efforts next fall toward ur
ging the Rhodes Trust to divest from South Africa
related companies.
Graduate student Bill Handley and seniors Mike
McFaul and Susan Rice held a noon press conference
to answer questions about the "Free South Africa
Fund," an alternate repository for those who want to
donate to Stanford but disagree with University invest
ment policy. The three students, along with senior
Laurie Edelstein, initiated work on the fund.
But the discussion at the conference turned to their
commitment to urging the Rhodes Trust to divest.
"When we meet other scholars in October, we will
try to gain support for those efforts," McFaul said.
Handley said they could face great difficulty because
the British Parliament is partially responsible for ad
ministering the Rhodes Trust.
"There are a lot of political considerations," he said.
"Getting Rhodes scholarships didn't immediately sen
sitize us to this issue. We have been concerned about
this for a long time," he said, arguing that "it's
ridiculous to say that by accepting the scholarships we
are being hypocritical."
The three opened their remarks by urging donors
who oppose Stanford's investments in South Africa
related companies to deposit money in the "Free South

Africa Fund" rather than giving directly to the Univer
sity.
The scholars announced its establishment to
coincide with Stanford's Centennial fund-raising cam
paign.
"I guarantee there will be people who will contribute
to this fund who would not contribute to the University
otheiwise (because of moral considerations)." Hand
ley said.
Donations will be withheld from Stanford until
either the University completely divests from South
African-related companies or black majority rule is
achieved in South Africa.
If neither occurs after 10 years, "the fund will be
donated to charitable relief for blacks in South
Africa," Handley said.
The interest-earning fund is to be administered by
the ASSU until it obtains non-profit status next spring,
and the ASSU Senate approved the plan Tuesday. The
fund will then be transferred to the direction of an au
tonomous board of trustees that will include the three
scholars and six others, Handley said.
Although no donations have been pledged to the
fund, Rice said, "We have received considerable sup
port from alumni and students. Until now, we have
concentrated our efforts on making sure the fund actu
ally is there.
"In the next few weeks, we will begin soliciting
alumni with a three-pronged ap
proach: we will send a letter to the
Stanford Observer (a University
publication); write letters to alumni,
targeting specific groups including
those in minority groups; and we will
make announcements at graduation,"

she said.
The three strongly criticized the
University's selective divestment
policy. "It's non-existent," McFaul
said. "The University made a com
mitment to selective divestment nine
years ago, and just got around to
divesting a mere $9,900 last week."
Stanford trustees decided to sell
that amount of Newmont Mining
stock at their May 13 meeting, a

move that marked the University's
first act of divestment.
"Of all the universities that have
even partially supported divestment,"
Handley said, "Stanford has divested
the absolute least."
In a prepared statement. Rice said,
"As Stanford students we are espe
cially outraged that the institution
from which we benefit buttresses the
apartheid regime."
