"Looking for an international af
fair?"
The Bechtel International Center
promises to answer this query,
printed on its promotional T-shirts, at
the seventh annual International Fes
tival tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Exotic foods, entertainment and
prizes will be among the attractions at
the event, which is to take place on
the backyard lawn of the I-Center.
Around 40 student-staffed booths
will sell delicacies from around the
world, according to Susan Whittlesey,
program coordinator at the I-Center.
Musical entertainment will be al
most continuous, from the more
familiar Stanford student groups
Counterpoint and the Fleet Street
Singers to the Ching Ching Chorus
representing China and Scottish high
land dancing.
Other events will include a
Japanese flower arranging demon
stration in the dining room from 11
a.m. to 1 p.m., two Mexican films and
the opportunity for people purchas
ing T-shirts to win a prize in a
drawing.
"The prizes this year are more
numerous than ever," said Whit
tlesey. "They range from the grand
prize of a room, dinner and breakfast
at the Stanford Park, to 10 free passes
to the New Varsity theater, dinners at
Mac Arthur Park Restaurant,
Ramona's, Nataraja, The Good
Earth, overnight at the San Benito
House in Half Moon Bay, and more."
Those not lucky enough to win one
of these prizes can wear their free T
shirts while taking consolation in a
free lunch from one of the booths.
In addition to fun, the Interna
tional Festival promises to be educa
tional as well. Many booths will bring
artifacts and answer questions about
their countries, according to Whit
tlesey.

Stanford's international commu
nity, including both foreigners and
Americans who participate in I-
Center activities, will host the fes
tival, according to Whittlesey. The
organizing crew, which consists of
about 35 people, has spent the past
two months on publicity and phoning
people. In addition, the crew will help
set up and clean up at the festival.
Another 150 to 200 people will be
cooking and entertaining.
"(Students from) small countries of
ten get their American friends to help
them cook," Whittlesey said.
Since admission is free, the event
will be largely self-funded, according
to Whittlesey, although Xerox, Thoits
Insurance and the Graduate Student
Association have made donations.

Whittlesey, in her third year as pro
gram coordinator, expects about
2,000 participants tomorrow. She
said the festival has "about tripled in
size" since she has been here and that
this year's is so far the biggest "in
terms of sheer numbers." '
She added that her personal ob
jective is to enjoy working with stu
dents and to help them work in har
mony and solve problems together.
"It's my small contribution to
world peace. I learn so much — I
build quality muscles of patience and
understanding."
The original impetus for the fes
tival came from the international stu
dents who wanted to share their cul
ture with the rest of the Stanford

community, she said.
"Events like these help people
realize that (the I-Center) welcomes
American as well as foreign stu
dents," she added.
As a warm-up for tomorrow's
event, 15 to 20 people carrying signs
representing their countries will
parade through Tresidder Union and
White Plaza today at noon.
The International Center, located
at the intersection of Mayfield Ave
nue and Lomita Drive on campus, is a
meeting place for American students
and faculty and the more than 3,000
students, post-doctoral scholars and
family members who come to Stan
ford from 101 countries, Whittlesey
said.
