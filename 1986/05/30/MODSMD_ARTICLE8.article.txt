Several faculty members and administrators will be playing musical
chairs during the next school year, with University President Donald
Kennedy's "'sabbatical" causing shifts in four positions.
Kennedy announced his plans for leave during winter quarter at a
meeting of the University Board of Trustees in March. He will be
working on the University Centennial Campaign and will focus on long
range planning and resources.
University Provost James Rosse will assume the position of acting
president, and with Kennedy's approval, Rosse has made appointments
for the other three positions.
Robert Street, currently vice provost and dean of Research and Aca
demic Information Systems, will become provost during winter quarter.
The provost serves as the University's chief academic and budget officer.
"Street has experience within the provost's office and as an academic
administrator," Rosse said.
Allan Cox, dean of Earth Sciences, will take Street's position. Cox has
been at Stanford since 1967.
" Dean Cox is an experienced academic administrator. He is the best
person for the vice provost's position," Rosse said.
George Thompson, chairman of the Geophysics Department, will
serve as acting dean of Earth Sciences. He has been a professor at Stan
ford since 1949 and has served in this position before.
According to Rosse, "George Thompson is competent and highly re
garded. He has been successful in acting in this position in past years."
