# Zschau to visit the Farm
## 
### ANN MARSH Staff writer 
"Who is Ed Zschau, and why does
he keep sending me mail?" went the
one-liner in last fall's Gaieties, and
with the Republican primary at hand,
now is the time to find out.
Stanford students will be able to
meet Zschau, front-runner in the race
for Republican nomination for U.S.
Senate, Sunday at a noon reception at
the Bowman Alumni House grove.
The event, sponsored by Stanford
College Republicans, will be Zschau s
last public appearance before Tues
day's primary, according to Jason
Matherly, former president of the
student organization.
Zschau, who was elected to the
12th U.S. Congressional district in
1982, received his Ph.D. in business
and an M.B. A. and master's degree in
statistics from Stanford. He also has
been an professor at both the Stan
ford and Harvard business schools.
Matherly said he expects about 500
Zschau supporters at the event, which
will feature food and music. Zschau,
whose district includes Stanford, will
speak on "just about everything, he
will touch a lot of bases," Matherly
said.
"Students are invited" along with
"all contributors and supporters," ac
cording to Tricia Aartz, campus advi
ser for Zschau's campaign.

'We're not overconfident" about
the primary, Aartz said, adding that
there are still "a lot of undecided
votes" Zschau will try to capture.
Campaign workers are "hoping
that more people will vote," she said,
explaining that most "people who
vote regularly vote pretty con
servatively."

Although Zschau is seeking the
Republican nomination, his stance on
various issues makes him a moderate
among a largely conservative field.
Opposing a constitutional amend
ment to permit prayer in schools,
Zschau has called the Moral Majority
"out of step with traditions of the Re
publican Party."

He also opposes a constitutional
amendment that would ban abortions
and supports the Equal Rights
Amendment.
Zschau's trend toward conser
vatism "means conserving not only
financial resources, but also our envi
ronmental resources," he said at a
recent Orange County rally.
"There are a lot of moderate
Republicans who haven't figured out
who the moderate is," Zschau said in
an interview with the Times Tribune.
A recent poll appearing in the
Times Tribune conducted by Teich
ner and Associates shows 49 percent
of voters in the "undecided" cate
gory.
To capture these voters, Zschau
told the Times Tribune he would
stress his moderate positions on the
issues in the campaign's final weeks.
"The race is very tight," Matherly
said. "Ed's the only one who can beat
Alan Cranston" for the Senate seat.
Two recent statewide polls appear
ing in the Times Tribune !:ave put
Zschau in the lead over Ed Davis,
former Los Angeles police chief;
Bruce Herschensohn, Los Angeles
media commentator; Mike An
tonovich, Los Angeles County super
visor; Bobbi Fiedler, U.S.
representive from Northridge;
Robert Naylor, a state senator from
Menlo Park; and Arthur Laffer, an
economist.
