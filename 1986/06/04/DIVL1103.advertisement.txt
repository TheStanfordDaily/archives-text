Microdisc
Moves to the Stanford Bookstore
On June 13, the Microdisc Ordering Office in Redwood Hall will
cease operations; on June 14, the Stanford Bookstore will start up
its own Microdisc personal computer discount program. In nearly
all respects, the Microdisc program will simply move across
campus. The same products will be available at the same prices,
though the Bookstore intends to make it possible to use
MasterCard and Visa for payment in addition to personal checks
and money orders. The Bookstore will function as an authorized
dealer for Apple, HP, and IBM products, providing all the services
— such as product information, software upgrades, warranty
service and extended service contracts — that all authorized dealers
are expected to furnish.
The IRIS and DIS offices will continue to provide advice and
consulting to members of the Stanford community about whether
or not to buy a computer, what sort of system and software to
buy, how to expand the capabilities of a computer, and what to do
when problems occur.
Please note that all eligibility and purchase restrictions, including
the limitation of one system purchase per year, will continue to be
enforced.
