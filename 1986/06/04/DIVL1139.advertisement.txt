•Go to San Francisco and dive off the Golden Gate.
•Ride to Big Sur and leap from the cliffs.
•Swim in DeGuerre and arch gracefully off the diving board.
•Make a splash at The Daily. HHjH
That's right. The Summer Daily. BHK
The Summer Daily needs writers for news, features, books, entertainment, res
taurant reviews and sports.
We are also in need of night editors and copy editors. And photographers. And a
pair of weekly columnists for the Opinions page.
If you need some money to fund those weekend excursions to Carmel, The Sum
mer Daily can help there, too.
So stop by The Daily today and ask for Allison, leave a note or call 723-4632.

As a special added attraction, all writers for The Summer Daily paid vacation to beautiful, sun-soaked Spokane, "The Vacation
will automatically be entered in a contest for a 10-day, all-expenses- Capital of Eastern Washington — and Western Idaho, too."
