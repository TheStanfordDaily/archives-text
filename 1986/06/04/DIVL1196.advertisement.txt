Millions of good wishes
Kilometers of pride
Birth trauma be damned
In this life's joyous ride!
Experimental daught, you have
triumphed in spite of
our parental goofs!
We love you,
Mom & Dad
From Lufkin, TX
Soon you'll be standing
Dressed in cop and gown.
And no one will be prouder,
Than rhe family of Jennifer Drown.
Love, All of Us
From Roslyn, NY
CONGRATULATIONS!
DOUG PJGG
WE LOVE YOU!
Mom, Dod, Dill, Geoff 6 Choppie
