"There is rhor in theatrical represenrorion
which awakens whatever romance belongs
ro our character. The magic lights, the
pomp of scene, the fair, false, exciting life
that is detailed before us, crowding into
some three short hours all our most busy
ambition could desire — all these appeals
to our senses are not made in vain. Our
taste for castle building and visions deepens
upon us, and we chew a mental opium
which stagnates the other faculties, but
wakes that of the ideal."
