# Mosher seeking degree
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Former Stanford anthropolog)
graduate student Steven Mosher, ex
pelled for allegedly "immoral" ac
tivities while conducting research in
China, is seeking to obtain his doc
torate through a special program
which would grant him a Stanford
Ph.D. in Chinese Studies.
Mosher, who is currently suing
Stanford for reinstatement, said yes
terday the University has not yet
responded to his proposal, made ear
lier this year.
"(University President Donald)
Kennedy has declared that I'm still in
good standing, even though I'm no
longer a Ph.D. candidate in anthro
pology," Mosher complained, charg
ing that under such circumstances he
should be permitted to obtain his
doctorate under a self-designed pro
gram.
Dean of Graduate Studies
Elizabeth Traugott, to whom
Mosher's proposal is specifically di
rected, was unavailable for comment
last night.
Mosher was expelled by the An
thropology Department in 1983 for
"immoral conduct" during a two-year
stay in mainland China. Charges
leveled against him include retaining

camera equipment belonging to the
University and leaving a government
van with Chinese villagers with whom
he was living.
Mosher has maintained, however,
that he was expelled because he em
barrassed Chinese government offi
cials by publishing articles and
photographs revealing China's con
troversial birth control program,
which included forced abortions in
late stages of pregnancy.
He explained yesterday that in or
der to be eligible for the special doc
toral program, it will be necessary to
find four faculty members to certify
that he has completed all graduate re
quirements. The scholars need not all
be professors at Stanford, Mosher
said.
One problem, he admitted, is a
University regulation which requires
such special programs to be submit
ted within the first three years of the
candidate's studies. Mosher entered
Stanford's doctoral program in 1976.
"I've asked if those particular re
quirements can be waived," Mosher
said.
Since his expulsion, Mosher has
received support from a considerable
faction of scholars, 60 of whom are
now members of the Steven Mosher
Defense Fund, a group formed to
support Mosher's suit against the

University.
Mosher yesterday quoted a state
ment by University Professors for
Academic Order, a national organi
zation of scholars which charged the
University with having "yielded to
blatant intellectual intimidation in ex
pelling Steven Mosher from its doc
toral program in anthropology. . . an
injustice has been done to Mr.
Mosher by an institution which
should be among the foremost
defenders of academic freedom."
Anthropology Chairman Harumi
Befu, while maintaining that the de
partment "stands by" their decision
to expel Mosher, said that such a spe
cial doctoral program would be possi
ble "if (Mosher) could find people to
certify it."
"We don't think he should be get
ting a degree in anthropology. If
other departments will give him one,
that's their business," Befu said.
Kennedy, who last year-upheld the
Anthropology Department's decision,
said yesterday it was "unlikely"
Mosher could be reinstated through a
special program in another depart
ment.
However, permission from the
University president is not required,
Kennedy said, since Mosher was ex
pelled by the Anthropology Depart
ment and not by the University.
