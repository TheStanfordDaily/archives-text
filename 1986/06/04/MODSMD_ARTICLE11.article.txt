# Kennedy defends decisions, discusses leave

Long-range planning will be needed if
Stanford is to weather the current
"uncertain" financial climate, according to
University President Donald Kennedy.
In a year-end interview with The Daily last
week, Kennedy also rapped critics of his role
in the ongoing Mosher controversy, defended
University-community relations and ad
dressed recent faculty hiring and promotion
conflicts.
Kennedy rebuffed those who continue to
criticize his decision to uphold the 1983 ex
pulsion of former anthropology graduate stu
dent Steven Mosher.
"For a variety of reasons that are historical
but involve correct decisions about what we
could and could not reveal, the University
found itself in a position where the media
really didn't trust [Stanford] to be telling the
whole story," Kennedy said.
Mosher, who is currently planning a lawsuit
against the University, has consistently held
that his expulsion was due to pressure from
the Chinese government rather than his al
leged misbehavior — including misappropria
tion of University camera equipment and in
fractions against the Chinese government
during his visit in 1979 and 1980.
The continued "misunderstanding" is
"partly our fault, partly a historical accident
and partly the fault of a campaign that doesn't
really distinguish theory from fact very well,"
Kennedy said.
"To compound the problem, Mosher is now
sort of a right-wing cause celebre, and the
people who are arguing his case for him in
print are really selling a conspiracy theory and
not an argument based on the facts," Ken
nedy said.
"Unfortunately, because it involves heavy
doses of political doctrine, lots of people, I
guess, who are ready to buy it, are buying it."
The Kennedy-bashing that has taken place
among conservative commentators has not
dissuaded his belief that the decision was cor
rect. "What happens on the editorial pages of
the Wall Street Journal and what William

Buckley |writes] about me don't really bother
me very much," Kennedy said.
While pondering the latest criticism from
Buckley, Kennedy also recalled a past run-in
with economist Milton Friedman in the pages
of Newsweek magazine.
"I've had a wonderfully liberating experi
ence. I've been attacked in a very ad hominem
fashion by two quite distinguished national
columnists on the right for quite different
things, and 1 discovered to my surprise and
pleasure that very few people noticed."
In order to devote his time more fully to
long-range endeavors, Kennedy will embark

on a winter quarter "sabbatical" next year,
treeing him from the day-to-day duties of
University president.
Vice-President and Provost James Rosse
will assume the role of University President
during Kennedy's absence, beginning in
December 1986 and extending through
March 1987.
"What I wanted was a change of pace that
would give me a chance to concentrate (in
some long-range planning issues, and also on
the last stages of preparation of the Centen
nial Campaign," Kennedy said.
Though admitting "the change of pace will

do me good," Kennedy said weariness from
his virtually uninterrupted duties as provost,
commissioner of the Food and Drug Adminis
tration under President Jimmy Carter
and. most recently, University president, did
not contribute to his request. "I now have had
almost 10 unbroken years in big jobs, but I
don't think I've lost any of my zest for it,"
Kennedy said.
Free of the usual time constraints, Kennedy
said he will also make special appearances to
talk with principal contributors to the Centen
nial Campaign nucleus fund. The entire cam
paign is expected to net the University over

"What I wanted was a
change of pace that
whould give me a
chance to concentrate
on some long range
planning issues . . ."

$490 million for new campus construction as
well as faculty and academic program im
provements.
In addition to the Centennial Campaign, a
myriad of federal policies continues to have a
profound effect on University finances, but
the situation does not appear as ominous as it
did several months ago.
Stanford is "rooting hard" for a tax reform
bill approved by the Senate as it moves to a
conference committee showdown with House
conferees, Kennedy said.
University administrators are expected to
lobby heavily on behalf of the Senate version.

which restores most of the tax provisions fa
vorable to private higher education that were
sharply curtailed in the House version.
The status of indirect cost recovery rates for
government-sponsored research is also in
jeopardy. "We don't know what's going to
happen there," Kennedy said.
"In general, the financial outlook is much
less cloudy than it was three months ago,
when all we had was (Ways and Means Com
mittee Chairman Dan) Rostenkowski's bill
out of the House and when the indirect cost
business looked as though it would be a big
bursting balloon," Kennedy said. "There is
nothing right now where either massive inter
vention or emergency planning is going to
yield us very much, because the situation is
too uncertain."
Instead of emergency action, Kennedy said
he is forming a special group of "promising
young people" to assist in long-range Univer
sity planning. "I want some staff and faculty
people who will bring new approaches and
modern training to planning tasks and who
are stakeholders (and) will be very much part
of this institution or likely to be in 2010, when
I'm on the sidelines," Kennedy said.
Concerning student-administration rela
tions, Kennedy said they continue to be
"pretty good" despite "occasional" problems.
He added that the administration must often
follow "our own best sense of what our re
sponsibilities are."
"One [problem] comes when students give
us pretty strong input and we don't do what
Ithey] say," he said. "Then students
sometimes say, 'Well, your're not listening,'
instead of concluding that we heard them
land] just didn't agree."
The criticism leveled at the administration
at a May 9 campuswide forum on University
governance and policies does not indicate a
deterioration of the Stanford community,
Kennedy said.
"I do think it would be a terrible mistake
for anyone to evaluate the health of this com
munity on the basis of that forum," Kennedy
said. "The forum was designed and advertised
in such a way that it really was a very strong
invitation to share concerns rather than to

comment across an entire range of evaluation,
(although) that does not invalidate it us a
device."
Kennedy also discouraged linkage of the
two well-publicized controversies in the His
tory Department. On May 16. Prof. Stephen
Ferruolo announced he would appeal his de
partment's decision to deny him tenure,
claiming the ruling treated him "unfairly and
discriminatorily."
Visiting History Prof. Norman Davies has
filed a $3.5 million suit against Prof. Harold
Kahn and 30 unnamed members of the de
partment alleging he was unfairly denied a
vacant endowed position in Eastern
European studies because of his treatment of
Polish-Jewish relations in a chapter of his
book on Poland.
"1 think it's a terrible mistake to aggregate
those and to think of it as different parts of
the same problem," Kennedy said. "Those
cases are as different as night and day. They
only happened to occur in the same depart
ment."
Despite his admiration of Ferruolo as a
teacher, resident fellow and member of the
University community , Kennedy said it would
be improper for a university president to
make qualified judgments of scholarship.
Although the current process does not al
ways insure "correct" or "perfect" judg
ments, Kennedy said the peer review system
is the "best and fairest" method to determine
tenured faculty.
"1 am particularly disturbed by the tone
and content of the allegations made by his at
torney, allegations that go far beyond the lan
guage of the complaint itself," Kennedy said.
Arguing that "any place is the right place
for stating something with conviction," Ken
nedy also expressed qualified support for stu
dent protest at next week's Commencement
exercises.
At last year's ceremony, hundreds of stu
dents carried black balloons and wore
"Divest Now" sashes. Stanford commence
ments are also known for conspicuous con
sumption of champagne by the graduates.
"I just hope we can have some perspective
and good taste about the occasion," he said.
