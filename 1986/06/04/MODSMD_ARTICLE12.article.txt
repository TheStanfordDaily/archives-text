# Police board proposal due soon
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Students and administrators designing a new
Campus Security Board should overcome the few
remaining differences of opinion this month and
submit a final proposal for University President
Donald Kennedy's approval, according to ASSU
Senate Chair Carey White.
During the first week of summer quarter, Dean
of Residential Education James Lyons will meet
with White, ASSU Senator John Van Loben Sels
and COP-elect member Rudy Fuentes to address
the security board's charge piece by piece.

The idea for the advisory board first appeared
after student protestors at an October anti
apatheid rally accused arresting officers of police
brutality.
The board, which should begin meeting next
year, will analyze data, make recommendations to
the Stanford Police Department and help facilitate
better communication between the police and the
Stanford community. The board will consist of stu
dents, faculty, staff and police
White and Lyons agree that the negotiations
have been positive.
The administration "really wants to do some
thing like this," White said.

The talks "have been very easy going," Lyons
said.
But, while the two sides say they are quite close
to an agreement, there remain several areas of dis
agreement between the students' and the Univer
sity's vision of the police board.
The board needs to retain some student sugges
tions if it is to be successful, White said. First,
White recommends that the final charge for the ad
visory board include specific duties and responsi
bilities like surveying the Stanford community to
collect data on police related issues.
Lyons, who said he doesn't see this
issue as a major problem, warned
against making the board's duties "so
specific so as to keep the board from
having the discretion it ought to
have."
White would also like to see groups
such as the United Stanford Workers
(USW) represented in the staff posi
tions. By ensuring these positions to
the USW, "there is a good chance
that (union members) will be able to
come out front with issues."
But Kennedy said yesterday he is
"strongly opposed" to the idea of
reserving staff positions for specific
groups, adding he would expect USW
members to be present on the board
from time to time, however.
Lyons said he favors having repre
sentatives from all segments of the
University on the board, but he ob
jects to these segments appointing
their own representatives. If that hap
pens the board might have too many
members, he said.
Finally, the two sides have yet to
discuss a change in the standard
practice of calling meetings and a
proposal giving a subset of the board
the power to add items to the agenda.
Since planners first considered de
signing a board, the role has been ex
panded to include a wider variety of
police matters. These new roles in
clude cutting down the campus crime
rate and establishing a dialogue with
police on specific issues like the ques

tion of differential treatment for stu
dents and faculty. White said.
White hopes that planners will not
become caught up in these new tasks
and lose sight of what the board was
originally intended to do: discover
how police should break up fights and
conduct arrests at student protests
without a repeat of the October inci
dents, he said.
"We're not a street light board," he
added.
Kennedy did not attach this same
importance to the student protest
issue.
"I don't think it is the most impor
tant reason for having it. It is not on
the top of my list," Kennedy said,
adding that the relative importance of
the question had not hampered
negotiations.
