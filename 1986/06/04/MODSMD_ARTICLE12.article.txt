# Police board proposal due soon

### MARK BEYREIS Senior staff writer 
Students and administrators designing a new
Campus Security Board should overcome the few
remaining differences of opinion this month and
submit a final proposal for University President
Donald Kennedy's approval, according to ASSU
Senate Chair Carey White.
During the first week of summer quarter, Dean
of Residential Education James Lyons will meet
with White, ASSU Senator John Van Loben Sels
and COP-elect member Rudy Fuentes to address
the security board's charge piece by piece.

The idea for the advisory board first appeared
after student protestors at an October anti
apatheid rally accused arresting officers of police
brutality.
The board, which should begin meeting next
year, will analyze data, make recommendations to
the Stanford Police Department and help facilitate
better communication between the police and the
Stanford community. The board will consist of stu
dents, faculty, staff and police
White and Lyons agree that the negotiations
have been positive.
The administration "really wants to do some
thing like this," White said.

The talks "have been very easy going," Lyons
said.
But, while the two sides say they are quite close
to an agreement, there remain several areas of dis
agreement between the students' and the Univer
sity's vision of the police board.
The board needs to retain some student sugges
tions if it is to be successful, White said. First,
White recommends that the final charge for the ad
visory board include specific duties and responsi
bilities like surveying the Stanford community to
collect data on police related issues.
