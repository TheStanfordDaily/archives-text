# Theme house plan gets mixed reviews
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ 
In an open meeting Friday,
members of the Stanford community
offered mixed reactions to a proposal
concerning the creation, organization
and review of theme houses.
While students applauded the in
tention behind the Subcommittee on
Residential Education and Advising's
(SREA) proposal, they contested the
committee's decision to give a stu
dent's committment to the
residence's theme a higher priority
than the student's ethnicity in filling
spaces.
SREA Chairman Craig Heller

stated that the new proposal "offers
equality and access, but guarantees
critical mass." Under the new
guidelines, any student can obtain a
priority for the house by committing
to its thematic programs.
However, ethnicity does again
become a criteria if 50 percent of the
spaces fill with students not of the
ethnic origin of the theme house, ac
cording to the proposal.
Heller said the proposal confirms
the incorporation of theme houses
into the University residential system.
Theme houses began as an experi
ment in the 1960s and have operated
until now without a firm set of

guidelines, he said.
Donna Anderson, member of the
Black Student Union, echoed the
general sentiments of the students in
contesting the diminished role of a
student's ethnicity. "I think it is atro
ciously disgraceful that being black is
considered less important than being
interested in black culture," she said.
One speaker cited the single
occupant rooms in Ujamaa as an ex
ample of why students would sign-up
for a theme house even if they were
not interested in the culture.
Tamsen Holm, a native American
student living in Robinson House,
said she feels the proposal does not

address the needs of less populous
minority groups such as native
Americans. "When I received the
proposal, I was shocked to discover
that priority housing didn't fit in at
all," she said. Robinson is presently
the only house with an ethnic priority.
Heller stated that the committee's
agenda this year was specifically lim
ited to setting up guidelines for theme
houses.
The new proposal creates addi
tional responsibities for the theme
houses such as annual year-end
evaluations of the program and the
establishment of a house advisory
committee.
