"Divestment has come of age," Seth
Zuckerman, a 1983 Stanford graduate and
recipient of the Dinkelspiel Award, said at a
press conference yesterday where alumni
award winners made a call for divestment of
University stock in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa.
. Their call for University divestment was
previously included in a letter addressed to
the Board of Trustees, signed by 27 Stan
ford alumni, all Gores and Dinkelspiel
award recipients, and eight faculty mem
bers.
I he letter was the first such statement on
divestment by an organized group of Stan

ford alumni and is the first such stand in the
history of the University, according to the
press statement issued by the group.
Steven Fuller, a 1985 Gores Award win
ner said, "Apartheid is antithetical to the
ideals Stanford professes.
"Apartheid promotes violence against the
majority of South Africans, and has led to
aggression against the peoples of neighbor
ing African countries. U.S. investment, in
cluding Stanford investment, lends both
monetary and moral support to this system,"
he said, reading from the letter written to
the trustees.
Fuller said that divestment is the most ef
fective tool Western nations can use to fight
apartheid and was supported by the

majority of black South Africans.
"Stanford has a reponsibility as a leading
institution to take a public stand against
Apartheid. Divestment is the only way for
this university to put its institutional weight
on the side of the black South African
struggle for justice and eqaulity," Fuller
said.
Zuckerman said the University's present
position "is not moderate, as some would
have us believe," but lags behind other uni
versities, "exposing its policy as conserva
tive and implicitly racist."
According to Zuckerman, Stanford has
done little to combat apartheid since it
surfaced as a major issue in 1977. He called
on the University to take concrete measures
against apartheid.
