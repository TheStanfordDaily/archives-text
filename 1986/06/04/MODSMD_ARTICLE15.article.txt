## 
### VIVIAN ROGERS Staff writer 
Stanford has filed a patent infringement
suit against a Florida-based biotechnology
firm for selling flourescent pigment com
pounds developed here.
The compound, phycobiliprotein con
jugates, enables researchers to detect sub
stances at minute concentrations in the body
by lighting up a bright blue or red.

Coulter Electronics of Hialeah, Fla., an
electronic instrumentation and clinical
reagents firm, learned about the invention
through the inventors. "They started using
the product before Stanford received a pat
ent," Ku said. "Our office warned the firm
that they must get a license soon, however
they kept advertising the product."
The suit, filed in a U.S. district court in
Florida, alleges that Coulter Electronics
sells the patented compound without a

license. Stanford is seeking damages and an
injunction against the firm to stop sales
The patent was sought by both Stanford
and UC-Berkeley and was issued to Stan
ford in May 1985. The two institutions share
royalties accrued through the licensing pro
gram, Ku said.
Stanford has licensed two companies to
use the compound, according to Becton
Dickinson of New Jersey and Applied
Biosystems of Foster City.
