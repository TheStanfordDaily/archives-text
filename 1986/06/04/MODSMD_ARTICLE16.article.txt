### RUSSELL KOROBKIN Staff writer 
Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos), who nar
rowly won the Republican nomination for
U.S. Senate yesterday, made his final cam
paign appearance prior to the primary elec
tion at Stanford Sunday.
Zschau, who has represented this area
since 1982, spoke for 15 minutes and
mingled with the crowd of 350 at an after
noon picnic held at the Bowman Alumni
Grove. Zschau supporters from the area
were invited, as were Stanford students, ac
cording to Julia Hartung, Zschau's statewide
volunteer coordinator.
The Stanford College Republicans co
sponsored the event along with the Zschau
campaign, Hartung said.
Zschau thanked community members for
the "inspiration" he received from their hard
work and support throughout the primary
campaign. "It gives me such tremendous
desire to go on and do the very best that I
can," he said.
He went on the reiterate the main themes
of his campaign â€” a strong economy, a
strong defense with creative diplomacy, and
caution "about what we do today so our

children will have a better future tomorrow."
The picnic location was chosen because
"Stanford is near and dear to Ed's heart,"
Hartung said. Zschau received an M.8.A., a
master's degree in statistics and a Ph.D. in
business from Stanford and served briefly as
a professor in the Stanford Business School.
Zschau emphasized his commitment to
taking action now that will preserve the eco
nomy and the environment for the future.
He said that balancing the federal budget
was important to do "for our children," and
stressed environmental protection: "A con
servative conserves all of the resources of
our nation," he said,
Zschau said he believes that
"opportunities" are not enough unless all
Americans can share in them. He said that
throughout his campaign he's "emphasized
equal opportunity legislation" including the
Equal Rights Amendment.
He also stressed the importance of
protecting the free enterprise system, and
said his understanding of that system, ob
tained in his years as a Silicon Valley execu
tive, would enable him to do so. Zschau said
that he hopes his campaign will encourage
others from the private sector to "get in
volved."
