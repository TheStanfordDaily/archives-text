## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's farewell 
### 
Taking Leave of a Friend
HI iw mountains to the north of walls,
White river winding about them:
Here »rf must make separation
And no out through a thousand miles of dead urass.
Mind like a floating wide cloud.
Sunset like the part inn of old acquaintances
Who how over their clasped hands at a distance
Our horses neinli to each other
as we are departing.
Rihaku
Translated by Ezra Pound
Each time I read this poem I feel a chill. Simultane
ously, 1 feel a sense of desperation and longing for the
separation not to take place, and a feeling that it is ne
cessary. The friends have reached a point of comple
tion, it is time to move on; a positive thing. And they
will take what they have learned from each other with
them on their journey. Although separated, they will
always be somehow connected.
This poem describes my emotions as I leave The
Daily.
I have spent much of my college career in The Daily
office. I have grown, and watched others grow — as in
dividuals and as journalists. I have been inspired by the
people who work here to be a part of the thing called
journalism, a thing at once exhilarating and exhaust
ing, and I hope I have inspired others.
The Daily has been a home to me, in between
moving from dorm to dorm on this campus it has been
a constant. It's a home to most of the people on the
staff. Not a home in the sense of a house but a sense of
place and a state of mind. So that it travels with us, and
changes us. The Daily is a part of the people who work
here. Because of it we are continuallly looking, ques
tioning — more aware of our environment. At The
Daily, we receive a unique education.
I consider myself fortunate to be a part of this educa
tion, and I am grateful to the people who have allowed
me to learn and who have taught me. My thank you list
extends to the people who have seen a house ad and
come in to write one article, to the motivated and
talented people who throw their lives into producing

this newspaper, to the people who call in with tips or
contribute to the opinions page, to my friends on
campus who have provided support and feedback.
I want to thank everyone on the staff for their contri
butions. I thank Geoff Sanborn and Peter Haven for
their equanimity and consistency; they seem to keep
cool when everyone else is a little too hyper. I thank
Allison Hartwell for her thoughtful dedication and
Mark Lawrence for falling in love with The Daily.
A special thanks to Mike Newman and Marilyn
Wann for their understanding and friendship. And
Brendan Healey's spunk has given me endless smiles.
Thanks to the old-timers for their seasoned advice —
and for being among the only ones left who can share
my "remember when . . Daily stories. And thanks to
the eager newcomers who bring a certain freshness to
The Daily.
As for the true gurus of The Daily — Bev, Paul,
Mike and the ASSU typesetters, you're often too nice
to us, and we appreciate it. And to the business side,
you're often not too nice to us, but we appreciate you
too. It has been my pleasure to work with Dave Ben
well, Dana Treister, Dawn Curlee and the advertising
staff.
Coming into this volume I had great expectations. In
fact, all of us at The Daily have a certain set of expecta
tions each day — we are constantly trying to put forth
our best journalistic effort — and sometimes we fail. I
think my volume will be notorious for the latest Daily
ever — the sp.m. issue. You probably don't remember
that one — you may have missed it. Of course, we
learn from our mistakes, we feel pangs when we see er
rors in print, and we grow even more from them.
I even had great expectations for what I was going to
write in my editor's farewell — my last chance to ex
press my thoughts on The Daily. But I guess I've
become long-winded and overly sentimental — trying
to prolong the end. So some hundreds of Diet Cokes
later, it's time for me to part with The Daily. Successes
combined with failures, it has met my expectations,
and I hope it has met yours.
For whatever I encounter next in life, working on
this newspaper with the people I've known here will be
a tough act to follow.
It's not easy, taking leave of a friend.
