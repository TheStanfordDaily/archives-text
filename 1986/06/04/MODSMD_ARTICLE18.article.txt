# Give to alternative fund
## 
### 
Last week, three Stanford Rhodes scholars an
nounced the establishment of the Free South Africa
Fund, a non-profit trust. This fund will serve as a
repository for contributions to Stanford to be held in
escrow until the University totally divests from corpo
rations doing business in South Africa. The students
set up the trust to coincide with Stanford's Centennial
Fundraising Campaign in order to provide an alterna
tive endowment for alumni and other donors who wish
to contribute to Stanford but are dissatisfied with the
University's current investment policy. The establish
ment of the Free South Africa Fund — which will at
first be under the ASSU and then transferred to an au
tonomous, non-profit, legal trust overseen by a board
comprised of Stanford alumni, faculty and staff — is a
very important step in the continuing struggle for di
vestment on the Stanford campus.
As the Rhodes scholars stated at a press conference,
the date June 16, 1986 is a significant one; it will be
their first full day as alumni of Stanford. It also hap
pens to be the l()th anniversary of the Soweto Uprising
in South Africa. In the past 10 years, the political situa
tion in South Africa has deteriorated dramatically. In
the past year alone, over 1,000 black South Africans
have been killed on the streets. But at the same time,
Stanford continues to buttress the apartheid regime
through its investments in corporations doing business
in South Africa. In fact, in the last 10 years, through in
creased investments, the University has actually
strengthened its ties to the apartheid regime.
In the 10 years since Soweto, the Stanford commu
nity has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the Uni
versity's investment policy. Students, faculty, staff and
workers at Stanford, as well as over three-quarters of
the black population in South Africa, have made it
clear that the most effective and meaningful action
which Stanford can take in response to the situation in
South Africa is total divestment. But the University
has failed to listen. The University claims to be follow
ing a selective divestment policy, but the only "result"
of this policy has been a meager $9,900 divestment
from a total of approximately $182 million invested in
companies doing business in South Africa.
Given the circumstances in South Africa today, it is

clear that this action, or rather inaction, on the part of
Stanford and the Board of Trustees, is completely in
adequate. As the situation in South Africa has grown
more desperate, Stanford's investments in South
Africa have only increased, and Stanford has failed to
exercise the influence it has. Just as the blacks in South
Africa are growing impatient with the slow pace of
reforms, we at Stanford are growing frustrated with the
false promises of the board.
The establishment of the Free South Africa Fund is a
constructive way to place pressure on the University to
change its investment policy. There are many good
reasons to give to Stanford, but the University's cur
rent position regarding divestment is also one reason
not to give to Stanford. An alternative endowment
fund, however, provides the opportunity for donors to
continue to contribute to Stanford, while at the sam
time expressing their dissatisfaction with the Univer
sity's investment policy. This trust can also show the
University that the call for divestment is not limited to
a small group of students currently attending Stanford.
Rather, the divestment movement is widespread and
has support from many alumni and other donors.
Indeed, the Free South Africa Fund should appeal to
a broad group of donors who are concerned with the
University's current investment portfolio. Moreover, it
is only through efforts such as the establishment of this
trust and sustained community concern that the Uni
versity will be moved to pursue a more socially respon
sible investment policy. The University has obviously
not responded to the moral imperative of the situation
in South Africa, but they may be swayed by the eco
nomic pressure of this alternative endowment fund.
We hope that many donors, particularly this year's
graduating class which is currently being solicited for
senior class pledges, will contribute generously to the
Free South Africa Fund. Similar funds have been set
up at Columbia and Harvard and have been successful.
In fact, at Harvard, their trust was established by the
senior class which donated its senior gift as the start-up
money for the fund.
It was the students of Soweto who led the struggle in
South Africa 10 years ago, and it is our responsibility
to do the same here at Stanford.

ing a selective divestment policy, but the only "result"
of this policy has been a meager $9,900 divestment
from a total of approximately $182 million invested in
companies doing business in South Africa.
Given the circumstances in South Africa today, it is

clear that this action, or rather inaction, on the part of
Stanford and the Board of Trustees, is completely in
adequate. As the situation in South Africa has grown
more desperate, Stanford's investments in South
Africa have only increased, and Stanford has failed to
exercise the influence it has. Just as the blacks in South
Africa are growing impatient with the slow pace of
reforms, we at Stanford are growing frustrated with the
false promises of the board.
The establishment of the Free South Africa Fund is a
constructive way to place pressure on the University to
change its investment policy. There are many good
reasons to give to Stanford, but the University's cur
rent position regarding divestment is also one reason
not to give to Stanford. An alternative endowment
fund, however, provides the opportunity for donors to
continue to contribute to Stanford, while at the sam
time expressing their dissatisfaction with the Univer
sity's investment policy. This trust can also show the
University that the call for divestment is not limited to
a small group of students currently attending Stanford.
Rather, the divestment movement is widespread and
has support from many alumni and other donors.
Indeed, the Free South Africa Fund should appeal to
a broad group of donors who are concerned with the
University's current investment portfolio. Moreover, it
is only through efforts such as the establishment of this
trust and sustained community concern that the Uni
versity will be moved to pursue a more socially respon
sible investment policy. The University has obviously
not responded to the moral imperative of the situation
in South Africa, but they may be swayed by the eco
nomic pressure of this alternative endowment fund.
We hope that many donors, particularly this year's
graduating class which is currently being solicited for
senior class pledges, will contribute generously to the
Free South Africa Fund. Similar funds have been set
up at Columbia and Harvard and have been successful.
In fact, at Harvard, their trust was established by the
senior class which donated its senior gift as the start-up
money for the fund.
It was the students of Soweto who led the struggle in
South Africa 10 years ago, and it is our responsibility
to do the same here at Stanford.
