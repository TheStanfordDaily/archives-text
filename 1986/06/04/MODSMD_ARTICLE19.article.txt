# Reagan's SALT mistake
## 
### 
President Reagan's decision to defy the SALT II
agreement is the latest manifestation of his misguided
militarism. Given that SALT II was written with "the
goal of achieving general and complete disarmament."
there is little surprise that Reagan plans to disregard it.
Reagan claims that Soviet noncompliance renders
the SALT structure useless. However, there are only
three significant allegations of Soviet violations. It ap
pears that the Soviets may have overstepped treaty
limitations with their Krasnoyarsk radar, encryption of
data and development of an extra type of missle. Yet
these allegations provide no justification for abandon
ing the entire future of SALT.
The timing of the Reagan Administration's decision
is extremely poor. It comes amidst the Soviet unilateral
test ban and numerous Soviet disarmament proposals
â€” including nuclear arms elimination. Moreover, plans
to escalate the nuclear arms stockpile are among the
last things the world wants to hear after the Chernobyl
disaster.

The costs of this new U.S. policy could be very high.
We are alienating our close allies like Britain and West
Germany. We are even jeopardizing the possibility for
a summit meeting or for any substantial arms control
agreements this year. Soviet Premier Andrei
Gromyko termed Reagan's decision a "major
blunder."
Feasible arms control alternatives have not been
presented or attempted. The SALT structure is by no
means complete but it is clearly preferable to no agree
ments at all. Rather than suggesting an agreement to
replace existing treaties or using them as a basis for
new ones. Reagan relies on his Star Wars dream to end
our nuclear peril.
The nonsensical abandonment of treaties serves no
other function than to reveal to the world that the
United States is not really for any serious arms control.
Paul Warnke. who was senior negotiator of the SALT
II treaty in the Carter Administration, aptly summed it
up when he said "the nuts have won" the policy
debate.
