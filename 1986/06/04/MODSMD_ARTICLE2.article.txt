# Kennedy urges sanctions
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy last week issued a statement to
the State Department Secretary's
Advisory Committee supporting stil
ler federal sanctions regarding U.S.
business interests in South Africa, but
he warned that South African laws
may work against the intended elfects
of U.S. restrictions on corporate sales
there.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
David Abemethy and Food Research
Institute graduate student Will
Masters spoke before the same com
mittee Monday, stressing that eco
nomic sanctions are only one means
of effecting change in apartheid-ruled
South Africa.
In his statement, Kennedy noted
that "the South African government
has enacted legislation that appears
10 guarantee it the use of the products
and technology of all companies in
South AA'ica, legaldless ol the com
panies' expressed inu 'it'oa no; to do
business with the government and,
even more important, regardless ol
any U.S. laws forbidding such sales to
the South African government."
Such legislation by the South
African government includes their
Defense Act. the National Supplies
Procurement Act and the Price Con
trol Act. Kennedy noted.
"These laws further prevent any
subsidiary company from informing
the parent company and stockholders
of its dealings with government. Al
though we do not know the extent to
which the South African government
imposes the provisions ol (these laws)
upon U.S. corporations, the only con
clusion to draw is that whenever they
are applied, U.S. companies are being
forced to disobey the laws ol the
United States," Kennedy charged in
his statement.
" 1 I t<utv f 11 *â€¢ t /mi 1 \ (iti A mpri-
can companies in South Africa may
not have the ultimate effect desired;
we may have to move beyond our
narrow focus and consider a broader
approach, such as revisions in our
trade and tax policies. We may also
have to enlist the cooperation of our
allies in these matters.
"I do think it is past time for our
country to take a more pronounced
stand," he concluded in the state
ment.
During their 30-minute meeting
with the State Deptartment's com
mittee, Abernethy and Masters ex
plained that change in South Africa
be brought about by more than
simply imposing economic sanctions,
Abernethy said yesterday.
"What we tried to do was present
specific actions the United States can
take ... in addition to sanctions, not
as a substitute," Abernethy said.
One example would be a move to
"deal with the fears of the people in

power" in South Africa, specifically
white bureaucrats in the current
apartheid regime who are afraid of
losing their jobs if the system is
changed, Abernethy said.
"They can be given training to al
low them to move into the private
sector, just as blacks would be
moving into the public sector," he
said.
The committee has requested more
information on research into the past
effectiveness of economic sanctions,
Abernethy said.
In a seven-page statement ad
dressed to the committee, Abernethy
and Masters also suggest the United
States take action that would aid in
"publicizing and legitimating the
claims of those denied access to
power," namely South Africa's politi
cally powerless black majority.
"Special attention should be
focused on Africans who are in prison
because of their leadership role in ad
vocating basic political rights for all
South Africans. . . . Outside of South
Africa, the U.S. government can take
more initiative to communicate di

rectly and openly with the exiled
leadership of the African National
Congress," Abernethy and Masters
say in their statement.
