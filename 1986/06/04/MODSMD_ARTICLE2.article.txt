## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy last week issued a statement to
the State Department Secretary's
Advisory Committee supporting stil
ler federal sanctions regarding U.S.
business interests in South Africa, but
he warned that South African laws
may work against the intended elfects
of U.S. restrictions on corporate sales
there.
Stanford Political Science Prof.
David Abemethy and Food Research
Institute graduate student Will
Masters spoke before the same com
mittee Monday, stressing that eco
nomic sanctions are only one means
of effecting change in apartheid-ruled
South Africa.
In his statement, Kennedy noted
that "the South African government
has enacted legislation that appears
10 guarantee it the use of the products
and technology of all companies in
South AA'ica, legaldless ol the com
panies' expressed inu 'it'oa no; to do
business with the government and,
even more important, regardless ol
any U.S. laws forbidding such sales to
the South African government."
Such legislation by the South
African government includes their
Defense Act. the National Supplies
Procurement Act and the Price Con
trol Act. Kennedy noted.
"These laws further prevent any
subsidiary company from informing
the parent company and stockholders
of its dealings with government. Al
though we do not know the extent to
which the South African government
imposes the provisions ol (these laws)
upon U.S. corporations, the only con
clusion to draw is that whenever they
are applied, U.S. companies are being
forced to disobey the laws ol the
United States," Kennedy charged in
his statement.
