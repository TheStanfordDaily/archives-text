# Jargon hinders understanding
## 
### 
I returned from the obligatory Stanford quarter over
seas to discover that I had precious little to say to anyone.
I had lost the desire to toss my two cents' worth of wisdom
into anything, and was struck by the feeling that commen
tary on most subjects had become superfluous, that the
conversations I was having were mostly re-runs of the past
four years, that explaining my own actions to others was
pointless, and that listening to people was a waste of time.
The problem seemed to lie with the words themselves.
Not only could I anticipate the content of what people
were going to say, but I could often predict the very words
they were going to use to say it. The words had a pattern
so regular they became like a language, and the shape of
that language was invariably determined by the group of
people who used it, or by the situation it described, or by
the doctrine it propounded. Each group had evolved a
tongue which served as a shorthand for concepts the
group members already accepted as given, a vernacular in
which they could hear their ideas spoken in a familiar and
reassuring form.

The existence of jargon is hardly my discovery, but I
find several of its principal effects particularly troubling.
First, a specialized language tends to innoculate those who
speak it against the influence of those who don't, creating
within the group a disturbing immunity to new evidence
and ideas. People speaking a common language enjoy
hearing their ideas articulated in a way to which they've
grown accustomed. Ideas gather validity with each repeti
tion, at least to those doing the repeating; and the comfort
and reinforcement provided by a common tongue can seal
off those who speak it from concepts which don't have a
name in their language.
Second, it hampers communication. People who don't
speak the language cease to listen to it, because they can
not understand it as its speakers do, and because they can
anticipate rhetoric which never varies its intensity or its
form. A gay friend of mine complained that when The
Stanford Daily Magazine devoted an issue to gay life at
Stanford, the editors didn't interview or quote any of the
more vocal members of the gay community, concentrating
instead on gays who were less publicly active. I didn't
want to be offensive, but I told my friend that 1 could fol
low the editors' reasoning. They were trying to attract
readers. A non-gay person who opens a magazine and
sees a story about a gay person dealing with the problems
of being gay will be far more apt to read the piece than
one who sees accusations of "blatant heterocentricity"
before the end of the first paragraph. It seemed, in fact,
that the editors' logic would have been acceptable to
anyone interested in spreading information about gay is
sues: you don't want people to put the magazine down be
cause they think they've heard everything you have to say.
It should be evident that when adherents of a cause riddle
their audience with the jargon of that cause, they are act

ing counter to their own interests.
My friend's (probably irate) response would be that the
content of the words, rather than their form, would an
tagonize people; and that since they're not going to
change the content of what they have to say, they may as
well phrase their points the way they choose. On one
hand, he was right; the content of the magazine would
have been enough to deter some people from reading it.
But form does matter, not simply because of aesthetic or
political concerns, but because it affects so profoundly the
reactions of those one wishes to persuade.
Criticisms I've received about these columns, for exam
ple, have centered not on any position I have taken (my
columns were largely non-political), but on my failure to
respond to whatever issue I'd addressed with a neat, easily
categorized opinion that people could identify quickly and
file away. I tended to concentrate on some nuance of a sit
uation I felt had not been examined very closely, and did
not offer broad, hortatory prescriptions for change. What
was significant was that I alienated some people who actu
ally agreed with me by not saying what they wanted to
hear the way they wanted to hear it. I wrote a column
which expressed my misgivings about the U.S. bombing of
Libya, in which I used a stylized, second-person narration
describing the decidedly non-political, emotional reac
tions of an unidentified character. A very liberal grad stu
dent in one of my classes who had spent a good 10
minutes in class one day criticizing the bombing dismissed
the column as "kind of literary," having decided, ap
parently, that because I hadn't said "U.S. militarism
abroad must stop," I hadn't really said anything. When I
explained to her that our views were roughly congruent,
she still found my presentation of the issue inadequate, a
complaint reducible to, "You have rendered an accep
table argument in an unacceptable form."
Obsessive reliance on politically correct language is ul
timately self-defeating. It turns organizations into self
contained sounding boards, produces meetings in which
everyone sits around agreeing with one another (or worse,
hashing out the finer points of their terminology), and
contributes to a reactionary frame of mind which prevents
people from thinking beyond the boundaries of their spe
cial vocabulary.
When I am trying to reach people, to change them, to
do something other than evoke a mass nodding of heads
from those who already agree with me, form is crucial.
When we are concerned with communication, this form
must necessarily concern language, because it is ultimately
the only medium large enough to contain the things we
have to say to each other. Images are powerful, particu
larly opposites in juxtaposition, and gestures are
forthright and music is sweet. But past a certain level of
abstraction, we can no longer rely on these things to con
vey the infinite range of the mind and heart. We need
words. When people corrupt words for the sake of politi
cal expediency or ideological comfort, they diminish the
principal communicative force we have; that this is dan
gerous should be self-evident. But by walling out others
with their language, they also hurt the cause they
presumably wish to serve, rendering themselves powerless
to reach or to change those who oppose them, and thereby
embracing the very bonds they hope to shatter.

more vocal members of the gay community, concentrating
instead on gays who were less publicly active. I didn't
want to be offensive, but I told my friend that 1 could fol
low the editors' reasoning. They were trying to attract
readers. A non-gay person who opens a magazine and
sees a story about a gay person dealing with the problems
of being gay will be far more apt to read the piece than
one who sees accusations of "blatant heterocentricity"
before the end of the first paragraph. It seemed, in fact,
that the editors' logic would have been acceptable to
anyone interested in spreading information about gay is
sues: you don't want people to put the magazine down be
cause they think they've heard everything you have to say.
It should be evident that when adherents of a cause riddle
their audience with the jargon of that cause, they are act

ing counter to their own interests.
My friend's (probably irate) response would be that the
content of the words, rather than their form, would an
tagonize people; and that since they're not going to
change the content of what they have to say, they may as
well phrase their points the way they choose. On one
hand, he was right; the content of the magazine would
have been enough to deter some people from reading it.
But form does matter, not simply because of aesthetic or
political concerns, but because it affects so profoundly the
reactions of those one wishes to persuade.
Criticisms I've received about these columns, for exam
ple, have centered not on any position I have taken (my
columns were largely non-political), but on my failure to
respond to whatever issue I'd addressed with a neat, easily
categorized opinion that people could identify quickly and
file away. I tended to concentrate on some nuance of a sit
uation I felt had not been examined very closely, and did
not offer broad, hortatory prescriptions for change. What
was significant was that I alienated some people who actu
ally agreed with me by not saying what they wanted to
hear the way they wanted to hear it. I wrote a column
which expressed my misgivings about the U.S. bombing of
Libya, in which I used a stylized, second-person narration
describing the decidedly non-political, emotional reac
tions of an unidentified character. A very liberal grad stu
dent in one of my classes who had spent a good 10
minutes in class one day criticizing the bombing dismissed
the column as "kind of literary," having decided, ap
parently, that because I hadn't said "U.S. militarism
abroad must stop," I hadn't really said anything. When I
explained to her that our views were roughly congruent,
she still found my presentation of the issue inadequate, a
complaint reducible to, "You have rendered an accep
table argument in an unacceptable form."
Obsessive reliance on politically correct language is ul
timately self-defeating. It turns organizations into self
contained sounding boards, produces meetings in which
everyone sits around agreeing with one another (or worse,
hashing out the finer points of their terminology), and
contributes to a reactionary frame of mind which prevents
people from thinking beyond the boundaries of their spe
cial vocabulary.
When I am trying to reach people, to change them, to
do something other than evoke a mass nodding of heads
from those who already agree with me, form is crucial.
When we are concerned with communication, this form
must necessarily concern language, because it is ultimately
the only medium large enough to contain the things we
have to say to each other. Images are powerful, particu
larly opposites in juxtaposition, and gestures are
forthright and music is sweet. But past a certain level of
abstraction, we can no longer rely on these things to con
vey the infinite range of the mind and heart. We need
words. When people corrupt words for the sake of politi
cal expediency or ideological comfort, they diminish the
principal communicative force we have; that this is dan
gerous should be self-evident. But by walling out others
with their language, they also hurt the cause they
presumably wish to serve, rendering themselves powerless
to reach or to change those who oppose them, and thereby
embracing the very bonds they hope to shatter.

I returned from the obligatory Stanford quarter over
seas to discover that I had precious little to say to anyone.
I had lost the desire to toss my two cents' worth of wisdom
into anything, and was struck by the feeling that commen
tary on most subjects had become superfluous, that the
conversations I was having were mostly re-runs of the past
four years, that explaining my own actions to others was
pointless, and that listening to people was a waste of time.
The problem seemed to lie with the words themselves.
Not only could I anticipate the content of what people
were going to say, but I could often predict the very words
they were going to use to say it. The words had a pattern
so regular they became like a language, and the shape of
that language was invariably determined by the group of
people who used it, or by the situation it described, or by
the doctrine it propounded. Each group had evolved a
tongue which served as a shorthand for concepts the
group members already accepted as given, a vernacular in
which they could hear their ideas spoken in a familiar and
reassuring form.

The existence of jargon is hardly my discovery, but I
find several of its principal effects particularly troubling.
First, a specialized language tends to innoculate those who
speak it against the influence of those who don't, creating
within the group a disturbing immunity to new evidence
and ideas. People speaking a common language enjoy
hearing their ideas articulated in a way to which they've
grown accustomed. Ideas gather validity with each repeti
tion, at least to those doing the repeating; and the comfort
and reinforcement provided by a common tongue can seal
off those who speak it from concepts which don't have a
name in their language.
Second, it hampers communication. People who don't
speak the language cease to listen to it, because they can
not understand it as its speakers do, and because they can
anticipate rhetoric which never varies its intensity or its
form. A gay friend of mine complained that when The
Stanford Daily Magazine devoted an issue to gay life at
Stanford, the editors didn't interview or quote any of the
more vocal members of the gay community, concentrating
instead on gays who were less publicly active. I didn't
