## 'Yes, grad students do exist at Stanford' 
### 
Having read yet another Stanford Daily article cutting down graduate
students, we feel it is time that people like Marilyn Wann (the author)
were informed about our existence. If Marilyn can't seem to find
graduate students, perhaps she is looking in the wrong places.
She looked tor us in the Coffee House, and reported that we weren't
there. This is correct since the Coffee House is not really the place to go
unless you re an undergrad who wants to look like a grad, i.e. who wants
to be seen in a place that actually sells beer! If Marilyn was clever
enough to get herself a take ID that says she's 21, then maybe she could
have tound us at the Lancashire Pub in Palo Alto on a Monday night
where Graduate Engineering Students tend to gather. Tuesday, the stan
dard hideout is at the St. James Infirmary for "burger madness," and
Wednesday at the Emerson St. Bar & Grill for comedy night. Thursday
we take a break to study, and Friday through the weekend, anything
goes.

A common misconception is that grad students do not exist because
they are seldom seen at undergrad parties. Try to imagine how many
Stanford seniors you might expect to find at a Paly High dance. Grad
students prefer to go to their own parties which are often off-campus.
Why do undergraduates like Marilyn Wann feel compelled to write
derogatory articles about grad students? Perhaps she's having trouble
getting into grad school. Or maybe there just haven't been enough arti
cles like this one defending grad students. Perhaps we should thank
Marilyn for provoking this response.
It is sate to say that most undergrads try to have as much fun as possi
ble (even though Green Library is always mysteriously crowded). Many
grad students, however, have already gone through that phase, "gee I'm
a college co-ed," and are now more serious about their careers. Nearly
all grad students are funded, not by their parents, but by the University,
government or by indsutry. We must prove ourselves on a regular basis
for our funding to continue. Most undergrads, however, are supported
by Daddy, and if they don't do too well in school. Daddy will support
them for a fifth year. This is why undergrads can afford to he more aloof
about their studies.
Just as undergrads have stereotyped us, we too have observed com
mon peculiar behavior amongst the undergraduate species, inflamatous
couchus. These observations have prompted us to ask the following
questions:
• Why do so many undergrads ride around on 15-speed Mountain bikes,
when there are no mountains on campus?
• Why do they wear wild Hawaiian shorts down to their knees while
trying to get a tan?
• Why do they use di-syllabic words in their speech, e.g. "Let's have a
fro-yo at the Co-Po," when they should he perfectly capable of using
three and four syllable words?
• Why do they feel lost without a theme? What is the point of having a
theme house for pop tart-lovers from two-scooter familes? (We have
reason to believe that this theme house is in the Cowell Cluster.)
We would like to ask these questions of Marilyn, but we can't seem to
find her anywhere. Marilyn, do you exist?
Larry Lessard and Vip Tolat are graduate students.
