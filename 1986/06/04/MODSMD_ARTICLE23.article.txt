Intramurals are
corrupt, not fun
Competition is an integral part of
the collegiate atmosphere, and is gen
erally regarded as a positive experi
ence for all students involved. But
corruption often follows competition.
By corruption I mean the willingness
to do "whatever it takes to win."
Such corruption is apparent in pro
fessional sports, with the prevalence
of drug problems; in intercollegiate
athletics, with constant recruiting vio
lations; and in the intramural system
at Stanford.
I have participated in the intra
mural program at Stanford for three
years now, and I have come to the
conclusion that our intramural system
is as corrupt, if not more so, than pro
fessional sports programs.
My freshman year I was really
excited to play intramurals on my
dorm team, but it was quite disheart
ening to watch other teams win by
cheating. In order to master this "art
of winning" one needs to cheat better
than the rest.
The only ways to win in intramurals
at Stanford are illegitimate ones: to
recruit from all over campus, regard
less of residence, social or specific in
terest group affiliation; to use players
that also play on other teams; and to
use players on a given B-league team
who play on either an A-league team
already or, even more infamously,
players who have lettered for that
sport's varsity team.
The system is corrupt to a large ex
tent because the people in charge are
corrupt as well. No one seems to en
force the rules. If any mention of
cheating is made to officials in the in
tramural office, it is at once covered
up. Covering up is easy if you know
the right people.
Intramurals, according to the Intra
mural Handbook, are supposed to
"serve student/staff interest." How
does one define "student/staff inter
est"? Whose interests are intramurals
really serving?
Every student wants to win. That's
the important thing. If you learn how
to win in intramurals, then you'll
know how to win in life, right? Or
could the point of intramurals be to
get to know your housemates, to par
ticipate in a sport that you enjoy — in
short, to have fun?
The Stanford intramural system is

not serving the majority's interest,
but just a small minority: the minority
of students who are in intramurals
merely to win.
What solution can I offer? It seems
that for years now the Stanford Intra
mural program has catered to such
cheaters. The only student group that
seems to participate in intramurals
for the fun and love of sports alone is
the freshman class — mainly due to
its naivete. As freshmen, they have
not yet been exposed to the poor
sportsmanship that corrupts the intra
mural atmosphere. I propose separat
ing the freshman from the rest of the
student participants, and letting them
build the foundation for a new intra
mural system at Stanford.

Reagan's decision
upsetting to allies
Our European allies are under
standably upset at recent announce
ments of the Reagan Administra
tion's intent to violate the current
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
(SALT II) — this action would
renege on a commitment the United
States made to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
In December of 1979, NATO
made its "double-track" decision: the
Europeans acquiesced in the 1983
deployment of U.S. cruise and
Pershing II missiles, while the United
States agreed to seriously pursue
arms control negotiations with the
Soviet Union. At the time, it was
argued that deployment was neces
sary to make the Soviets negotiate.
For U.S. military leaders,
negotiations were the price for being
allowed to deploy. Either way, the
result would be deployment. The
m : isiles went in.
How has the U.S. govern
ment handled its side of the bargain?
There has been a long series of arms
proposals cynically designed to elicit
Soviet rejection while placating
public opinion. Reagan has appointed
men openly hostile to arms control to
key arms control postions. He has
kept up a simplistic anti-Soviet drum
beat, alleging Soviet nuclear superi
ority that official Pentagon assess

ments deny. He has refused any limits
on weapons in'space and pursued re
search that undermines treaties on
space and on anti-satellite weapons.
Now he plans to violate SALT II so
he can continue the biggest military
buildup the world has ever seen.
In short, the double-track decision
was double talk. The Europeans were
tricked. So were we. The bloated mil
itary budgets, the defense contractor
frauds, the new weapon systems and
the plans for nuclear war continue. So
must our active opposition, through
education, lobbying and direct action.

Cultural influence
is never one-sided
As I am about to graduate, 1 feel
that the recent beginnings of dialogue
between concerned administrators,
faculty and students about important
public issues in the University such as
divestment, governance and the
Western Culture requirement are
positive signs for Stanford's future.
This kind of beneficial dialogue
should be encouraged at all times and
facilitated more often so that the is
sues don't just "go away." The
dialogue 011 each of the issues has not
been exhausted by any means.
For a case in point. 1 will now turn
to the Western Culture requirement.
My main complaint about it is that 1
see it as one negative force that acts
to undermine a notion that I cherish
— that of world unity and oneness.
First of all, I believe in pluralism: that
there are good things to learn about
each and every ethnic group, that one
needs to understand the perspectives
of other people and other peoples, es
pecially in today's rapidly shrinking
world. A former war refugee from
Viet Nam, 1 am now an American cit
izen and I think it's good to learn
about the various European culture
influenced aspects of my adopted
land.
But I consider myself more as a cit
izen or member of the world and all
humanity. 1 wish, as I leave Stanford,
that I and all other students had been
required to learn about the rich cul
tural heritages of our black, brown,
yellow and red sisters and brothers as
well as our white ones. While West

•em Culture has tremendously influ
enced the rest of the world, the
reverse has also been true. All cul
tural exchanges are reciprocal.
Picasso absorbed forms in African
sculpture and masks in his invention
of Cubism, laying the seed for
modern Western art as we know it
today. Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger and
countless others started by imitating
black hlues singers; it's fair to say that
most of contemporary Western
pop/rock music had its roots in Amer
ican black music. Many in the West
have been inspired by Gandhi's ideas
of non-violence, love/truth force and
civil resistance — witness the Civil
Rights Movement and the student
protests since the 19605.
(Incidentally, Gandhi himself was in
fluenced by Thoreau and Tolstoy —
two Western thinkers.)
What I want to say is that there is
an exchange of ideas and values
whenever cultures interact, and that
the present Western Culture require
ment doesn't bring this out. We are
deceiving ourselves if we think that
Western influence 011 the rest of the
world has been one-sided. Further
more, if it's true that the United
States is the "melting pot" (or more
realistically, the "stew pot") of all the
world's peoples, then a three-quarter
humanities requirement based solely
on Western culture has no place at
Stanford. At its worst, such a require
ment in our day and age of inter
nationalism promotes needless
divisiveness and alienation between
peoples; at its best, it is irrelevant and
obsolete. I don't offer any solutions;
rather, I'd like to quote from the late
John Lennon, who sang my feelings
so perfectly in "Imagine":
Imagine there are no countries
Its not hard to do
No need to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
Imagine no possessions
/ wonder if you can
No need for greed, no hanger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
I hope someday you'll join its
And the world will live as one
