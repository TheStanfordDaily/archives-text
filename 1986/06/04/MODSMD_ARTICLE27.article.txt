## Stanford's true exhibitionists 
### MICHAEL BARNES 
They are Artists, with a capital 'A.'
They have taken the road less
traveled. They are the graduating stu
dents of Stanford's Masters of Fine
Arts (MFA) program.
Some collected products of their
various personal journeys are cur
rently on display in the MFA exhibit
at the Stanford Art Gallery through
June 15, and they offer an ideal in
terlude to the stresses of Dead Week
and finals.
The four candidates in this year's
MFA class are Corey Cartwright
(painting), Craig Kirby (painting),
Roberta Ruiz (painting and drawing)
and Bob Tyson (photography).
Each MFA student has an on
campus studio in which to work. The
students also serve as teaching assis
tants in various studio art courses of
fered by the Art Department.
Although the MFA program has no
formal classes, the students nurture
their artistic talents through weekly
seminars, where one of the MFA can
didates presents his or her work to as
sembled faculty and fellow students
for critique.
"It's kind of intense with everyone
in your studio," says Cartwright. Ruiz
agrees, stressing that the learning
comes from"the intense focus on
work as an individual" because of the
involvement of fellow students and
faculty.
Indeed, the defining mark of the
Stanford MFA program is the small
size of the group and the quality of
the individuals in the program. The
four graduating candidates all agree
that a vast amount of the learning in
the program comes from fellow stu
dents over the course of the two-year
studies.
Kirby received his bachelor of
fine arts degree from the University
of Oregon at Eugene before coming
to Stanford. He calls himself a
"landscape painter," but says his
paintings are "an exploration of the
internal world rather than the exter
nal world."
His paintings begin as abstracts,
and after six months to two years of
work, they end up as landscape
scenes.
Craig stresses color and its rela
tionship to the material world. He
emphasizes visual issues perhaps
borrowed from a panoramic view of
the Dish, yet with hints of more com
plex objects (perhaps a building, per

haps a water tank) masterfully
worked into each piece through the
selective use of color and gestalt
forms.
The results are fascinating studies
of relaxed natural settings, with an
extra dimension added to the scene.
Kirby says his upbringing in
Oregon, as well as the works of
Corot, Inness and DeKooning, influ
enced his art.
His paintings are more traditional
than gallery art one might see on a
trip to New York, with an aim toward
contemplative visual statements
rather than a focus upon the current
issues being explored by many gallery
artists.
Tyson attended school in Palo Alto
and received his bachelor's in geol
ogy from Stanford in 1969. For a de
cade he worked his way through the
geology division of Bechtel Corpora
tion in San Francisco.
During that time, he actively
pursued an avocation in photography.
Such a double shift included arriving
home from Bechtel in the early even
ing with several hours of darkroom
work ahead of him. He remembers
that sometimes he took along his
young daughter to "sit in the
darkroom while dad worked away."
Eventually, though, photography
emerged as his chosen undertaking,
and Tyson entered the Stanford MFA
program.
Two facets of Tyson's work are on
display at the MFA exhibit. More
striking are the huge photo portraits
of the human face. Using sheer scale
as an artistic resource, Tyson's works
delve into the rare field of photogra
phy of faces.
He avoids using the primed models
of Vogue or human oddities from a
circus show. "You don't go to bed
with a 'model,' " Tyson says. Rather,
he presents "experiments in the types
of human faces we see many times
each day — just regular faces."
Yet therein lies the interest for the
viewer. On such a large scale, the
normal features of the human face
make artistic statements without the
aid of Revlon. The enlarged works
are intresting, even leaving the viewer
uneasy; such intrigue can exist in
something we are surrounded by each
day.
Tyson has no overall statement he
is pushing with the photo collection,
apart from the intrinsic art in each
human face. He doesn't personally
know many of the subjects, but says
"economic class is often apparent in

each face."
Also on display are a recent series
of small prints ranging in subject mat
ter from mountain cabins to children.
Ruiz received her bachelor of fine
arts degree from UC-Santa Cruz and
studied languages while receiving her
her art degree. Ruiz is a painter but
has on display both charcoal drawings
of human figures and oil paintings of
humans.
Her expressive use of color in the
paintings gives each subject a distinct
personality. Ruiz wants each piece to
"speak to the viewer" and foster an
individualistic interpretation. Indeed,
an observer could probably write a
paragraph accurately describing each
model's character, based solely upon
the emotion and personality Ruiz
manages to capture in each of her
portraits.
Ruiz' charcoal figure drawings
similarly catch the subject's state of
mind beyond that confined within a
mere facial expression. Her represen
tation of body and face work together
to define a personality for each sub
ject. The drawings, many comprised
of several sheets joined together, are
often "intuitive" drawings that Ruiz
had not "planned the size of
beforehand."
Cartwright did undergraduate
work at five colleges and ultimately
received his bachelor of fine arts
from the San Francisco Art Institute.
His participation in the MFA pro
gram was hampered by his ongoing
battle with a fused spine. The prob
lem required Corey to budget his
time to minimize the amount lost by
the problem.
Nonetheless, surgery was required
this year, which kept him away from
his work for months. He refers to his
MFA experience as "halved."
Corey says his painting and
drawing delve into themes of
"mystery," "simultaneous realities"
and "pluralism/contradiction." His
abstract works stress "images which
arc subliminally associative."
Although some viewers find his
works somewhat unsettling or angst
filled, he attributes such reaction to
preconceived biases observers carry
with them.
All the works in the MFA exhibit
are currently on display at the Art
Gallery, which is located across from
History Corner, next to the Cum
mings Art Building. The exhibit is
open from 10 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Tues
day through Friday, and 1 p.m. to
4:45 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
