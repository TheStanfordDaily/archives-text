# The 						Bug rides away on a dog with no name

And the Bug walked off into the sunset, leaving many
questions unanswered.
Dear Bug Me,
Was Yogi Berra named after Yogi Bear, or vice versa?
- George Steinbrenner, grad student
For those of you who aren't big followers of American
sports, Yogi Berra was a Hall of Fame catcher and later a
coach and manager (short-lived, as is the tradition with
Yankee skippers) for the New York Yankees. Born
Lawrence Peter Berra on May 12, 1925, Berra made his
first appearance with the Yankees in 1946, by which time
he had picked up the nickname "Yogi" for reasons I
couldn't find out (maybe something having to with his re
ligious preferences).
I talked to a public relations representative for the
Yankees, and after laughing at me he said, "I definitely
don't think Yogi Berra was named after Yogi and 800-
800. That's not a question I would have asked Yogi when
he was coaching here, either."
Hmmm. ..
Undeterred, I then called the creators of Yogi Bear,
Hanna-Barbera Productions in Los Angeles. The public
relations folks there told me that Yogi Bear made his
debut on the "Huckleberry Hound" show in 1958.
They said that although Yogi Bear's character was actu
ally patterned on Art Carney's Ed Norton character in
"The Honeymooners" TV show, the name was "definitely
borrowed from Yogi Berra."
Dear Bug Me,
Why do people who run dog sleds say "Mush" to get the
dogs going? Why not "Grits" Or "Cream of Wheat"?
- Barb Wire
This one had me at wit's end for some time. Finally, I
called a dog sled dealership — "Rae's Harness Shop" in
Anchorage, Alaska — and talked to a gentleman named
Jim Bridges.
Bridges said that the usage of "Mush" by dogsledders
comes from French Canadian dogsledders, who would say
"Marche" (which sounds exactly like the English word
"marsh") to their dogs. That's the familiar command form
of the French verb marcher, meaning "to walk" or "to
go-"
Bridges said that English-speaking sledders bastardized
"Marche" to "Mush." However, he said that "Mush" isn't
very commonly used anymore because it's a soft-sounding
word, and sledders favor a sharper-sounding command.
One example he gave was "Hike," but it seems like
"Grits" might do just as well.
For myself, when I was growing up in Fairbanks and
riding my dog sled to school every day, I preferred to be a
little more diplomatic with the dogs. I used to say gentle
things like "Say, fellas, do you think you could stop
pooping on the neighbor's lawn and get going? I'm
already late for class and everything . . . pretty please with
Alpo on top?"
Dear Bug Me,
Have you ever noticed the "Accidents and Injuries

Report" in Campus Report? It lists cause and type of injury
and days lost. For example: "Bite on finger from rat, days
lost 0"; "Headache due to hitting head on typewriter, days
lost 4." Why do they publish this? To whom is it impor
tant? Who types this for Campus Report? Don't they die
laughing at some of these 'accidents and injuries'?
My question: What are some of the funniest, or most
bizarre accidents that have been published?
-Nothing better to worry about
I talked to Karen Bartholomew, the editor of Campus
Report, about this, and she was very helpful.
She said that the paper has been running the
"Accidents and Injuries" column for several years and
that its purpose is primarily an educational one, with a
goal being "heightened awareness."
"The hope is that it will encourage people to be more
careful by seeing the nature of injuries that people are suf
fering," Bartholomew explained.
In the early days, according to Bartholomew, articles
about the nature of the accidents accompanied the basic
statistics, but now the paper has trimmed back to just the
statistics.
Bartholomew was kind enough to look through some
back issues of the paper and select some of the more inter
esting reported accidents.
They include "Strained muscle while practicing
restraint," "Twisted ankle slipping on banana peel,"
"Fungus under fingernail due to use of glue," "Strained
back lifting binders," "Scratched eye due to fistfight over
animal equipment" and "Numbness in hands due to using
computers" (which is what I'm getting right now).
Bartholomew went on to say that these things may be
funny to read, "but are undoubtedly very painful and un
fortunate."
She also raised the concern that running the "Accidents
and Injuries" column may "encourage people to file
reports on accidents that may not be terribly serious — for
instance, paper cuts."
Dear Bug Me,
I was wondering if you could tell me this. I hope so.
What are the three (or five) most common names for both

males and females in the Stanford student body? And why?
Thanks, sir.
Love,
a consumer
Well, since you put it that way. .. . This was the first
question I started working on when I inherited this
column back in February, so it seems appropriate that it's
the last question I answer.
For quite some time I puzzled over how 1 was ever
going to get this information. Finally, I did what just
seemed like the most logical thing and put my Bug Me
support staff of 12 refugee Oompa-loompas to work
scouring the Stanford phonebook and tallying the names.
But the shiftless midgets quickly disabused me of any
notions that they might complete the task in any
reasonable amount of time.
In fact, they had only reached the Ls by the time they
quit, complaining that their eyes hurt and that the ink
from the phonebook was running off on their little orange
hands. One even had the audacity to ask if I had ever
heard of computers and if not, what was my problem?
That gave me an idea. I called Dean Namboothiri of the
Registrar's Office. He ran a computer program that
counted first names of the entire undergraduate popula
tion of Stanford. Frankly, this kind of thing absolutely
boggles my computer-illiterate mind, so I'm very grateful
to Mr. Namboothiri for his work.
The winner on the men's side is David, of which there
are 182 in the student body. Not far behind is John with
161, followed by Michael (141), Robert (117) and James
(94).
For women, Elizabeth tops the list with 71
(interestingly enough, less than half as many as any of the
top three male names, which just goes to show you that
women have a lot more good names to choose from). Next
in line on the distaff side are Jennifer (69), Lisa (56),
Susan (52) and Mary (47).
That answers the empirical part of the question, but not
the analytical (why) section. To get some authoritative
word on this, I called social psychologist David (there's
that name again) Rosenhan of the Psychology Depart
ment and asked him if there is any psychological explana
tion for people assigning certain names to children more
often than others.

He had a simple explanation, saying that "some n a m "
just become mentally available . . . because everybody
else uses them." Rosenhan said that his "personal choice
is 'Max.' "
My personal choice is Yogi.
Well, it's time to say goodbye.
This is a fond farewell. Bug Me has been a labor of love
for me over the last four months, and I have some serious
misgivings about leaving this column behind. Never again
will I have carte blanche to call up important people and
ask them mindless questions. Never again will 1 be
allowed to put in print anything my warped little mind
dreams up. Never again will complete strangers send me
tons of mail.
Of course, this was never a one-man column. Dozens of
people helped write it, either directly by sending in or
answering questions, or indirectly by offering me con
structive feedback and encouragement.
Bug Me wouldn't exist if people didn t send in ques
tions, and I'm grateful to everyone who shared his or her
curiousity with me. Contrary to what seems to be a very
popular belief, I never made upf/rtv of the questions that
appeared in this column. Not that there wasn t a strong
temptation, but after a short drought period, I was
deluged with questions.
I apologize to those people whose questions I didn t get
to. Most I tried, a few I struck out on, some came at a time
in the academic quarter that didn't lend itself to extensive
non-academic research work, and still others were of such
political or ideological scope as to be inappropriate for a
column of this size and tone.
All those questions I didn't answer will be passed on to
my successor; hopefully, he'll have better luck with them.
I also owe particular thanks to everyone who helped me
answer questions. This includes faculty and staff mem
bers, fellow students and the receptionist at the Kellogg's
company in Battle Creek, Mich. With few exceptions
people were always gracious and cooperative, no matter
how peculiar and pushy my inquiries were. Those deserv
ing special recognition include University staff members
Bruce Wiggins, Linda Long, Doris Posner and Herb Fong,
as well as Carolyn Lougee's secretaries and the residents
of Adams and Donner Houses.
In addition, there were countless people who contrib
uted to Bug Me by offering encouragement and positive
feedback, and otherwise inspiring me to keep pursuing
life's little mysteries even when Bug Me Burnout set in.
First among many are my editor Debbie (who somehow
put up with my weekly conniption), Jeff, Chris, Cathy and
Myrna. And I can't forget my mom and dad, who always
answered my questions when I was little and still help an
swer some of the bigger ones, like "How am I going to pay
for my college education?" and "May I please come home
for Thanksgiving?"
Finally (I promise), I owe the biggest thanks to every
one who read the column faithfully, even when the ques
tions were boring and the answers even more so. If
readers found the column to be generally informative, and
maybe entertaining once in a while, too, then I retire a
happy Bug.
I guess the moral of this story is that regardless of what
your grade school teachers may have told you repeatedly,
there definitely is such a thing as a stupid question.
But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be answered.
