# Seth rides high on 'The Golden Gate'
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN 
"You could call me a serial
monomaniac or a cyclical obsessive,"
admits Vikram Seth, a graduate stu
dent in economics and author of the
highly acclaimed novel "The Golden
Gate," which was published last
spring by Random House.
Currently a recipient of a Guggen
heim Award for achievement in the
arts, Seth has also served as senior
editor of the Stanford University
Press and has written two other
books: "The Humble Administrator's
Garden," a book of poems, and
"From Heaven Lake," a travel book
culminating a few years of research in
Tibet and China.
"The Golden Gate" is currently at
the top of the Bay Area best sellers
list and has earned rave reviews from
the New York Times, Newsweek and
the Los Angeles Times Book Review,
among others.
This praise would be remarkable
enough for a doctoral candidate in
economics with little formal training
in writing, but what makes the warm
reception even more extraordinary is
that the novel, from its acknowledge
ments through its "Note on the Au
thor," is written completely in verse.
Seth says he got the idea of a novel
in verse from reading Aleksandr
Pushkin's Russian story "Eugene
Onegin." In fact, he wrote using a
rhyme scheme called the Onegin
stanza —a bub Iccdd leffe Igg.
Born in Calcutta, India, in 1952,
Seth attended Corpus Christi College
in Oxford, England, where he studied
philosophy, politics and economics.
He joined Stanford's Economics De
partment in 1975.
Since then he has done a wide vari
ety of things, although he has not yet
earned his degree.
"Stanford has been pretty
tolerant," he acknowledges. "I guess
as long as I don't sit here as long as
(former mathematics graduate stu
dent Theodore) Streleski, I'll be all
right."
"It's difficult to work on a novel
and economic dissertation at one
time," he says. He does not try to
combine his diverse interests, he ex
plains, but lets them co-exist.
"The Golden Gate" is set in the
Bay Area and recounts the ad
ventures of a yuppie named John, his
girlfriend Liz — who he meets
through an ad in the personal
columns — and their family, friends
and acquaintances.
Seth, however, says he does not
like the yuppie label the novel has
received, and claims most of the char
acters in the novel are not yuppies.
He says that the characters are
based "a bit on myself, a bit on

friends, a bit on what I've overheard,
and a bit on what I've made up." In
addition, he had to do a certain
amount of research on such things as
cats and vineyards, he says.
"The reader will know when
there's a gap in knowledge. People
won't believe the characters, and then
the bottom falls out of the story," he
explains.
He describes the process of writing
the novel as "constantly evolving
within the scope of the characters'
own personalities." He says he had
some ideas of future developments,
but he talks about the characters as if
they have minds and motivations of
their own.
"The writer should explain enough
so the story is not erratic, so that the
reader understands, but not so much
that he takes the life out of a charac
ter," he says.
The novel springs some intentional
shocks, one of which is somewhat un
fair, Seth admits. Although often
light-hearted and containing many
humorous scenes, "The Golden
Gate" also expresses characters' ear
nest feelings about such topics as nu
clear weapons and religion. It also
takes a rather tragic turn near the
end.
"I didn't know until quite late that
it (the novel) would be so serious,"
Seth says. "But life is both serious
and fun. Life has pain . . . and one
should not take that lightly."
As for his qualifications to write
the "Great California Novel," as
"The Golden Gate" has been called
by novelist and critic Gore Vidal,
Seth says "I've been here 10 years
and 1 love the place. I spent my 20s
here."
In fact, he considers the Bay Area,
along with India, home. But he says
he does not consider the book simply
a California novel.
"A story has to have a setting," he
says." We still read books by Dickens
dealing with 19th century London."
"I hope it ('The Golden Gate') will
last a certain amount of time, and if it
does then it will be because it is uni
versal. But one cannot write a novel
and hope it will be eternal. The in
trinsic life should not be lost."
Seth says he is both pleased and
surprised with the reception of his
first novel. He said he received "in
the low five figures" for "The Golden
Gate," not a lot of money for a novel
but an unprecedented amount for a
book of poetry.
"There is a lot of resistance to
reading poetry," he explains.
Seth adds that at one time three
publishing companies were bidding
for the book, but he stopped the bid
ding because he did not want to
choose a publisher on the basis of

which one offered the most cash.
"The book wasn't intended to
make money, but it will enable me to
live for a year," he says.
He says he cannot predict how far
the book will go, but that he expects it
to sell more by word of mouth than
anything else.
Having interviewed with People
magazine. Voice of America and the
Angeles Times Magazine, Seth
says he finds his new fame somewhat
disconcerting.
"People have been nice, but I
haven't been entirely relaxed. I've
enjoyed it, but it's very time
consuming, and I'll be glad when it's
over."
He talks about the letters he has
received ("some complimentary and
some crazy") and mentions two un
dergraduate women on the East
Coast who have read his book and
want to take him out to sushi when
they come to California.
No definite future plans are in store
for Seth. He says he thinks he'll be
going back to India soon, possibly to
study classical Indian singing.
"I do get bored doing the same
thing as far as work is concerned," he
admits. "For me variety not only
gives pleasure but makes me work
best. It seems very self-indulgent, but
I worc&yery hard at what I'm doing."

Seth does say he will write again,
though he does not know what —
perhaps a novel in prose.
"I get a great deal of satisfaction
from writing. I got a kick out of
writing 'The Golden Gate.' Even in
the sad parts there was a certain crea
tive pleasure, a sense of saying what
needed to be said."
Seth explains that he did not always
have this certainty about being a
writer.
"I've always been vaguely fond of
writing, but I certainly didn't think I'd
write a book."
Writing "The Golden Gate"
became something of an obsession,
according to Seth. He says his
thoughts started forming in patterns
of verse.
"It's a different world from ordi
nary speech and people, a different
mode of thinking."
"The Golden Gate" contains a
great deal he feels strongly about,
such as the nuclear issue, says Seth.
But overall, he feels its message is
about different kinds of affection.
"Life is short, youth is evanescent,
and the world is unstable. Given that,
human affection and human bonds
are to be cherished and not disdained
on the grounds of injured pride and
misunderstanding." a* ip
