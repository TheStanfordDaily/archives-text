# Baha'is worship on Farm

They are persecuted in Iran, and
since 1979, 198 of them have been
put to death. 767 imprisoned, 10,000
made homeless and over 25,000
forced to flee the country .
President Reagan quoted these fig
ures in a speech made during Human
Rights Week last December. He was
talking about the Baha'is, members
of a world religion that emphasizes
goals of peace and unity.
Members of the Baha'i faith come
from very diverse backgrounds; they
live in more than 300 countries and
territories, and most of them are con
verts from different religions.
Many Baha'is have been Bud
dhists, Jews, Muslims, Protestants or
Catholics. Some had no religion at all.
But all find » common basis in the
Baha'i faith that makes such diversity
and potential competition unimpor
tant to them.
A man named Baha'u'llah founded
this faith in 1863, calling upon people
to unite. He said that there is one
God, and that people should unite
under a common faith in Him; only
then will there be world peace.
Among the first tenets of this belief
is that all men and women are equal.
From this arises the fact that there is
no clergy in the Baha'i faith — the re
sponsibility of teaching falls upon
each Baha'i, not some specially desig
nated individual.
Here at Stanford, there are group
meetings called "firesides," where
Baha'is meet to discuss and teach
their religion. Graduate student Ab
dullah Brooks holds such firesides at
his home.
Brooks explains the unity of
religions by showing that each
prophet of God has built on the
preceding prophets.
For example, he points out that
Abraham first established the one
ness of God, or monotheism. Moses
built on Abraham's teachings by
proving that God has a will, a pur
pose, and that He is to be feared.
Then Jesus showed that this is also
a God of love and forgiveness.
Mohammed followed by advocating
that all religions come from one God;

we are all descendants of Abraham,
and should love each other as broth
ers.
Ihis traced lineage. Brooks says,
shows that all the prophets are com
pletely united. The Baha'is blame the
current variety of religions in the
world on misunderstandings and
misinterpretations of these prophets.
Brooks also notes that each
prophet comes at intervals of about
1,000 years. For this age, the Baha'is
believe that Baha'u'llah is the chosen
manifestation of God.

The responsibility
of teaching falls
upon each Baha'i,
not some specially
designated indi
vidual.

BahaVllah declared that religions
must unite and show men how to
build a just world. He emphasized
that justice is the greatest good in the
sight of God, and that only in one
common faith and one order could
the world find an enduring peace.
He also declared that terrible wars
would sweep the face of the earth and
destroy the institutions and ideas that
keep men from their rightful unity if
mankind does not unite under one
faith.
But the BahaMs are not really so
pessimistic about the outcome of the
earth. They have formulated a state
ment entitled "The Promise of World
Peace," which they sent to over 70
world leaders, including representa
tives of the United Nations.
Reagan also received a
statement, and expressed his hope
that the world may achieve world
peace.
Brooks says, "We believe the
world will not end in nuclear
holocaust. 'The Promise of World
Peace' is just that — a promise. We
think that mankind may achieve

peace and unity in the end. Civiliza
tions may perish, but mankind will
survive."
The peace statement provides an
optimistic outlook, saying that human
beings are not quarrelsome by nature,
and that the bad side of man can be
done away with by the elimination of
discrimination.
The peace statement particularly
notes the banefulness of racism, the
"inordinate disparity between rich
and poor," religious strife and per
ceived inequalities between men and
women.
The peace statement also says that
"unbridled nationalism must give way
to a wider loyalty, to the love of
humanity as a whole," and that "the
abolition of war is not simply a matter
of signing treaties and protocols but a
complex task that requires a new
level of commitment."
The peace statement calls upon
world leaders to hold a meeting; in
the words of Baha'u'llah, "The rulers
and kings of the earth must attend to
its needs, and, participating in its
deliberations, must consider such
ways and means as will lay the
foundations of the world's Great
Peace."
Senior Lisa Jacobson, a member of
the Baha'i faith, notes that "an ab
solutely crucial prerequisite to peace
is the unity of mankind. Most people
think that the ultimate goal of peace
is this unity, whereas from the Baha'i
perspective, unity is the starting
point, the foundation, the ground
level. Then you can start to build the
world government, the world institu
tions." The peace statement calls for
this unity.
Prof. Firuz Kazenzadeh will talk
more about the Peace Statement on
Friday, from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. at the
Oak West Room at Tresidder. His
speech is entitled "The Prerequisites
for World Peace."
A graduate of Stanford,
Kazenzadeh is currently chairman of
the history department at Yale and
serves on the National Spiritual As
sembly, the chief Baha'i administra
tive institution in the United States.
He has also testified before con
gressional subcommittees and the
United Nations on human rights.
