# Throw books at Nicaragua

Read any good books lately?
Well, if your books have become nothing more than
shelf clutter, law student Jose Ordonez says he might
have a better use for them, and he encourages people
to "donate any books that they are no longer using to a
good cause."
The "good cause" which Ordonez is referring to is
the book drive for aid to Nicaragua, sponsored by the
Stanford Sanctuary Movement and the Stanford
Central American Action Network.
Donations can be put in boxes located at Meyer Li
brary, the Latin American Studies Center in Bolivar
House, all academic departments. Tresidder and F.l
Centro Chicano. The drive ends Monday, June lb.
Ordonez says organizers are specifically looking for
engineering books for the National University of
Nicaragua, where there is an acute shortage of techni
cal books.
Senior Abigail Adams added that works of literature
are an important part of university life as well, but said
the need for these books is not as urgent.
All other books will be sold back to the Stanford
Bookstore and used to raise money to send aid for
supplies to the teacher-training school in Esteli. a town
which Ordonez said has been hard hit by the contra
war.
Senior Julia Lavine said this form of raising money is
"symbolic."
"I want to stress that while Reagan is calling his bill
to raise $100 million for the contras 'humanitarian
aid,' ours is an alternative for real humanitarian aid,"
she said.
"Here we are coming down on terrorist acts against
Europeans and Americans while we are funding the
same in Nicaragua."
Ordonez also called this project "true humanitarian
aid, as opposed to military aid."
Adams said "the aid is appropriate because the con
tras . . . cripple the community by undermining prog
ress and advances — such as attacking centers of edu
cation, health centers, teachers, silos and the agricul
tural common infrastructure.
"I lived in Central America for a while, and strongly
support organization-to-organization outreach,"
Adams explained. "As Stanford students, we have a
mutual understanding and a resource which we can
make available. When U.S. citizens think of sending
material aid, books do not occur to them.
"In the Nicaraguan situation, education is the big
gest part of social change. As a university . . . we are
bringing aid to a human, personal level, breaking
across the lines of nation or statehood."
The book drive's core committee, about a dozen
members strong, began speaking to dorms last Tues
day.

Part of this dorm outreach, Ordonez said, is "an
education campaign, telling students about Reagan's
bill which is coming up for a vote in Congress in July,
and urging students to write letters to their congress
men to oppose aid to the contras."
Lavine said she "received a positive reaction from
the dorms — some people disagreed (with) the politi
cal aspect of the letter writing campaign, but most
thought the book drive was a neat idea and were glad
to see substantial, concrete action rather than
protests."
Adams agreed. The response she received at Bran
ner, she noted, was "really heartening. . . . We brought
40 to 50 postcards and folks were just stopping by like
crazy."
Adams also said that the interest and support stu
dents have shown in the book drive is especially hear
tening at the end of the quarter.
"It is a hard time of year, when people are more con
cerned with piling their desks with books to write those
last papers and study for finals than with clearing their
shelves."
