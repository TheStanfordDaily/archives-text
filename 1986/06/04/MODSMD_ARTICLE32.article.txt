# Taking off on a farewell tangent in a Cessna

### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
"In case of emergency, please extin
guish all smoking materials and bring
your seat backs to their fully upright
position. Should loss of cabin pressure
occur, oxygen nuisks will drop from
the overhead compartment. ..."
Yeah, that's not what they told me
at Palo Alto airport, PAO to pros.
"Keep the nose on the center line;
neutralize ailerons," Bob, my flight
instructor, said. (Ailerons are these
flimsy little flaps dangling off the
backs of the wings.) "And turn the
transponder on so you can squawk
your position to the tower."
Before my eyes, ramen noodles
made loopy writing on bathroom
walls, Freud's cigar gave off puffs of
steam at the end of a tunnel, and Sea
Monkeys cilia-stroked their way
through oceans of whitening agents
— my entire literary career, as it
were, flashing over the cowling of a
Cessna 150 cockpit.
It all started with those late nights

at The Daily, waiting for the pages to
fill with copy, reading the ads:
"Stanford Flying Club, three months
to solo."
"Bring throttle in full over three
seconds. Count: one, two, three; steer
with your feet on the rudder pedals;
watch the air speed indicator for 55 to
60 knots and pull back on the
elevator," Bob said, I don't know
how many times.
Takeoff. You know that Alice
down-the-rabbit-hole moment right
before an old elevator stops at your
floor? That feeling.
Or maybe the moment when you
first swing out on the ski lift, mixed
with just a drop of Super Glue
suspense from the construction
worker dangling from a girder,
clutching his hard hat to keep from
falling.
"Vee haf lift-off, kiptin. Klingon
wessel approaching on starboard
bow, shall 1 vready the photon tor
pedos?" (I never actually said this,
but it would make perfect small talk
at 300 feet.)

"Not yet, Chekhov, just stay in the
pattern until you hit the Dumbarton
Bridge, then continue on a left stan
dard departure, out to the beach."
(Bob never exactly said that, either,
but something close).
Flying over campus puts that 10-
pager waiting in the Mac back home
in this 2,000-feet-and-climbing,

"Look Ma, no hands!" perspective
along with the flavors of the day at
the Corner Pocket and all those
OATQ announcements.
Bank slightly and they're all gone,
hidden by the strut that supports the
left wing.
(But right now, if I keep writing
two inches of copy every half-hour,

this will have to run in the summer
Daily, and all that mingled desire and
regret about writing a last column of
the school year will wither away tan
gibly like an unflown tangent doing
the tangerine tango.)
Here we are again, back with Bob
as he makes a joke during pre-flight
inspection and then muses,
"Sometimes 1 even amaze myself."
Great, my life is in the hands of a
four-cylinder lawnmower engine and
a Han Solo impersonator.
The terms confused me at first, es
pecially Bob telling me I had a bad at
titude. 1 pay $80 a lesson I should
smile too? No, attitude just means
angle of attack.
The first eight hours in my log book
are full of turns — turns in straight
and level flight, then dutch rolls
(fixing the nose on a point and rolling
the plane along that axis, like wig
gling a cork out of a wine bottle),
climbing and descending turns, a little
ground reference (angling the plane
into the wind to keep it going straight

related to the 101), more turns in
slow flight (power back and sloppy
controls), turns with the instruments
covered (Bob uses those rubber suc
tion cup things that cover the bathtub
drain), turns with me wearing a hood
to eliminate outside clues (Yeah, just
like the blast shield in Star Wars), and
then a review of turns.
Palo Alto is a great place to learn
landings, too. Ten feet in front of the
runway, there's this duck pond, so if
you land short you won't be able to
say you walked away from the crash
because you'll have to wade out
(making sure not to injure the geese;
they're protected by some law or
other).
I solo next Tuesday. 1 figure finals
week is a good, unstressful time to
take my life in my ailerons.
And if I die, at least 1 get out of my
Wednesday exams.
So when you hear that cry in the
sky, don't think it's Super Chicken
with Fred and the Super Sauce in his
Super Coop, it's one scared former
columnist.
