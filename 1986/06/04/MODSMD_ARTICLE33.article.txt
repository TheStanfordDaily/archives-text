# Why no one's sure about insurance anymore
## 
### STEVEN LURIE Staff writer 
What do the Boy Scouts, a Califor
nia town and the price of ski tickets
have in common? These seemingly
unrelated aspects of American life
are all being adversely affected by
changes in the insurance business. A
country that prides itself upon every
citizen's right to a quick and speedy
trial and to legal redress for griev
ances, America has become an in
creasingly litigious nation.
Suits alleging malpractice or
negligence resulting in personal in
jury have been filed against just
about any activity, business or profes
sion. In fact, between 1974 and 1984,
the number of product-liability suits
in federal courts has increased 680
percent.
Thus, insurance premiums, the fees
paid to buy protection to pay for
settlements, have skyrocketed. The
$9.1 billion that Americans paid in
liability premiums last year is almost
60 percent higher than in 1983.

Insurance is a similar resource to
oil: though vital throughout our soci
ety, it was not thought about much
until enormous price increases. Sud
denly, various segments of our system
are in the grips of what Time maga
zine describes as a "new national
crises." This is illustrated by
anecdotes from Stanford and the rest
of the nation. The challenge is to dis
cern the causes and enact remedies.
Most Stanford students may be
surprised to discover that the insur
ance crisis affects them in many ways.
Aquafollies, an annual outdoor party

held by Lake Lag, was cancelled this
year. Joe Pisano, director of Fraternal
Affairs, cited several compelling
reasons which include the fact that
the 1985 liability premium of $800
would have doubled this year.
Furthermore, the coverage would
have been less comprehensive. Pisano
concluded that a large and open event
such as Aquafollies is difficult to
monitor and is susceptible to lawsuits.
Those students who frequent the
ski resorts may be dismayed about
higher ski ticket prices. After a 100-
inch snow storm in 1982, the Alpine

Meadows ski area closed their lifts
and warned guests against skiing.
However, an avalanche struck the
parking lost and killed 7 people. Al
though a $10 million lawsuit was dis
missed, Alpine Meadows' liability
premium doubled in just I year. This
expense was reflected in ticket price
increases.
Students considering a professional
career may be diconcerted by the fact
that insurance problems have plagued
doctors, lawyers, engineers and mem
bers of corporate boards. Hardest hit
are high-risk medical specialty areas

such as obstetrics and neurosurgery.
According to the American Col
lege of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, 73 percent of its
24,000 members have been sued for
malpractice at least once. Over 3,000
of these members have subsequently
abandoned the specialty. As a result
of high settlements, the typical annual
premium for an obstetrician in Los
Angeles is about $45,000, while
premiums for a neurosurgeon in New
York is about $83,000.
Insurance concerns for Stanford
students mirror those of many

groups. Even a beloved institution
such as the Boy Scouts are not
immune. Soon they will impose a $20
fee on every troop in the country to
help pay liability insurance costs. The
fee is the first of its kind in the Scout's
76-year history and reflects a com
mitment, in the words of their motto,
to "be prepared" for the liability in
surance crisis.
Though the annual number of
claims filed against the organization
has been relatively constant at a mini
scule level, insurance costs have risen
from $2 million is 19H4 to $4 million
in 1985 and $10 million this year.
When the liability policy for the
Northern California seaside village of
Point Arena (population 450)
expired last July, the town officials
were unable to pay for the sudden 50
percent rate hike. The town even
considered posting a sign stating
"Enter at your own risk." Two-thirds
of California's 440 towns and cities
have been predicted to operate with

out insurance by next year.
PROpeace, the anti-nuclear Great
Peace March between Los Angeles
and Washington, D.C., was unable to
obtain a $5 million liability policy re
quired by some municipalities along
the marchers' route. Without such
coverage, PROpeaceniks were
denied the use of a schoolyard where
they had planned to camp for the
night.
Sponsors of public events such as
San Francisco's Chinese New Year
festival have had trouble securing
liability coverage. The main reason:
the unpredicatble nature of claims
made by audience members, on
lookers and participants.
Fhe attempt to discern the cause of
the crisis is very much still in the
finger-pointing stage. The different
players in the insurance dilemma all
point to legitimate faults in the other
parties.
Consumer groups blame the greed

of insurance companies who allegedly
have artificially inflated premiums to
cover for bad policies and poor man
agement. Insurance companies pay
about as much for claims as they col
lect in premiums, yet they make their
profits from investing the premiums.
Such investments paid well five years
age when the interest rate was 21.5
percent. Thus, insurers were more
willing to write risky policies to gain
more premiums to invest at such
lucrative interest rate levels.
However, when interest rates
plummeted and when the risky
policies had to be accounted for, in
surers suffered unprecedented losses.
Over 40 liability insurers have
become insolvent in the past two
years. Thus, premiums have been in
creased.
Insurers point to juries which
award astronomical verdict and to
greedy lawyers. Indeed, the first $1
million settlement did not appear un
til 1962 but now the average suit
exceeds this amount and 1984 saw
$401 million verdicts. Changes in the
law and practices have also contrib

uted to high suits.
The part of a verdict assessed to
compensate (such as for lost wages or
medical bills) is being eclipsed by
payments for non-economic damages
such as pain and suffering. Also,
punitive damages to punish and deter
have skyrocketed. A couple who sued
an insurance company for $1,650
were awarded $3.5 million in punitive
damages, which is 2,121 times the
size of the disputed bill.
Payment to lawyers is also
criticized. A victorious attorney may
collect from 30 to 50 percent of the
total verdict while one who does not
win the case is not paid at all. Thus,
the huge winner-take-all stakes,
which are enormous considering
multi-million dollar suits, may
promote a win-at-all-costs mentality.
Says Edward Levy, general manager
of the Association of California in
surance Companies, "Lawyers are
out to make a buck, and they seem to
have little concern for the overall
societal effects of what they are
doing."
Lawyers point to the negligence of

"big business" and affirm an individ
ual's right to legal protection. The
Ford Pinto case in which fatalities
resulted from faulty designs and the
numerous incidents of product recalls
illustrate this point.
Businesses point to a change of at
titudes that has accompanied increas
ing litigation. America's
entrepreneurial streak is being hin
dered by the public's sue-everyone
in-sight mentality. Says Gust
Headbloom. president of Michigan's
Apex Broach and Machinery Com
pany, "You're afraid to try anything,
put any new product on the market."
A flurry of legislative reforms,
1,200 since last December, have at
tempted to deal with the insurance
crisis. Most of them concern reform
of legal rules such as those involving
tort law. Senator McConnell of Ken
tucky has introduced a bill to es
tablich a $100,000 limit on punitive
damage awards for pain and suffer
ing. Missouri's Senator Danforth has
proposed to set uniform federal
standards in product-liability cases.
Several states are following Cali

fornia's lead in limiting contingency
fees for lawyers in medical
malpractive suits. Such a law awards
an attorney 40 percent of the first
$50,000 of a judgement but then
decreases the share to only 10 per
cent of any amount over $200,000.
Yesterday, Californians voted on
Proposition 51, the so-called deep
pockets initiative. The vote addresses
the question of whether a defendant's
liability for non-economic damages in
personal injury, property damage,
and wrongful death suits be based
only on his degree of fault. Currently,
those who lose a lawsuit can be held
100 percent liable even if they were
only minimally at fault. Thus, plain
tiffs often sue governments and busi
nesses with "deep pockets" of cash
when other defendants, such as unin
sured motorists, are broke.
For instance, drivers may name the
driver at fault plus the municipality
(say for failing to clearly mark a stop
street) in a suit. In the event of multi
million dollar punitive damages, the
municipality, which may only be
found 20 percent at fault, may end up

covering for the amount that the
other parties cannot pay. Proposition
51 would require defendants to pay
high-cost noneconomic damages only
in direct proportion to their degree of
fault.
Proponents claim 51 will correct
the current unfairness and prevent
high liability costs from being handed
down to taxpayers and consumers.
Opponents claim that victims would
no longer get full compensation and
that 51 does not guarantee lower in
surance rates. In fact, they claim that
insurane companies and other sup
porters of 51 want to increase their
profits by saving on damages at the
expense of victims.
The attention given by legislators
to the insurance problem testifies to
its importance. Fundamental changes
in our civil justice system are being
proposed in order to cope with a crisis
that affects a diverse yet large seg
ment of our society. Suddenly, insur
ance coverage is becoming like oil: an
invaluable resource upon which our
dependency is clear only when it
becomes scarce and expensive.

crises." This is illustrated by
anecdotes from Stanford and the rest
of the nation. The challenge is to dis
cern the causes and enact remedies.
Most Stanford students may be
surprised to discover that the insur
ance crisis affects them in many ways.
Aquafollies, an annual outdoor party

held by Lake Lag, was cancelled this
year. Joe Pisano, director of Fraternal
Affairs, cited several compelling
reasons which include the fact that
the 1985 liability premium of $800
would have doubled this year.
Furthermore, the coverage would
have been less comprehensive. Pisano
concluded that a large and open event
such as Aquafollies is difficult to
monitor and is susceptible to lawsuits.
Those students who frequent the
ski resorts may be dismayed about
higher ski ticket prices. After a 100-
inch snow storm in 1982, the Alpine

Meadows ski area closed their lifts
and warned guests against skiing.
However, an avalanche struck the
parking lost and killed 7 people. Al
though a $10 million lawsuit was dis
missed, Alpine Meadows' liability
premium doubled in just I year. This
expense was reflected in ticket price
increases.
Students considering a professional
career may be diconcerted by the fact
that insurance problems have plagued
doctors, lawyers, engineers and mem
bers of corporate boards. Hardest hit
are high-risk medical specialty areas

such as obstetrics and neurosurgery.
According to the American Col
lege of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, 73 percent of its
24,000 members have been sued for
malpractice at least once. Over 3,000
of these members have subsequently
abandoned the specialty. As a result
of high settlements, the typical annual
premium for an obstetrician in Los
Angeles is about $45,000, while
premiums for a neurosurgeon in New
York is about $83,000.
Insurance concerns for Stanford
students mirror those of many

groups. Even a beloved institution
such as the Boy Scouts are not
immune. Soon they will impose a $20
fee on every troop in the country to
help pay liability insurance costs. The
fee is the first of its kind in the Scout's
76-year history and reflects a com
mitment, in the words of their motto,
to "be prepared" for the liability in
surance crisis.
Though the annual number of
claims filed against the organization
has been relatively constant at a mini
scule level, insurance costs have risen
from $2 million is 19H4 to $4 million
in 1985 and $10 million this year.
When the liability policy for the
Northern California seaside village of
Point Arena (population 450)
expired last July, the town officials
were unable to pay for the sudden 50
percent rate hike. The town even
considered posting a sign stating
"Enter at your own risk." Two-thirds
of California's 440 towns and cities
have been predicted to operate with

out insurance by next year.
PROpeace, the anti-nuclear Great
Peace March between Los Angeles
and Washington, D.C., was unable to
obtain a $5 million liability policy re
quired by some municipalities along
the marchers' route. Without such
coverage, PROpeaceniks were
denied the use of a schoolyard where
they had planned to camp for the
night.
Sponsors of public events such as
San Francisco's Chinese New Year
festival have had trouble securing
liability coverage. The main reason:
the unpredicatble nature of claims
made by audience members, on
lookers and participants.
Fhe attempt to discern the cause of
the crisis is very much still in the
finger-pointing stage. The different
players in the insurance dilemma all
point to legitimate faults in the other
parties.
Consumer groups blame the greed

of insurance companies who allegedly
have artificially inflated premiums to
cover for bad policies and poor man
agement. Insurance companies pay
about as much for claims as they col
lect in premiums, yet they make their
profits from investing the premiums.
Such investments paid well five years
age when the interest rate was 21.5
percent. Thus, insurers were more
willing to write risky policies to gain
more premiums to invest at such
lucrative interest rate levels.
However, when interest rates
plummeted and when the risky
policies had to be accounted for, in
surers suffered unprecedented losses.
Over 40 liability insurers have
become insolvent in the past two
years. Thus, premiums have been in
creased.
Insurers point to juries which
award astronomical verdict and to
greedy lawyers. Indeed, the first $1
million settlement did not appear un
til 1962 but now the average suit
exceeds this amount and 1984 saw
$401 million verdicts. Changes in the
law and practices have also contrib

uted to high suits.
The part of a verdict assessed to
compensate (such as for lost wages or
medical bills) is being eclipsed by
payments for non-economic damages
such as pain and suffering. Also,
punitive damages to punish and deter
have skyrocketed. A couple who sued
an insurance company for $1,650
were awarded $3.5 million in punitive
damages, which is 2,121 times the
size of the disputed bill.
Payment to lawyers is also
criticized. A victorious attorney may
collect from 30 to 50 percent of the
total verdict while one who does not
win the case is not paid at all. Thus,
the huge winner-take-all stakes,
which are enormous considering
multi-million dollar suits, may
promote a win-at-all-costs mentality.
Says Edward Levy, general manager
of the Association of California in
surance Companies, "Lawyers are
out to make a buck, and they seem to
have little concern for the overall
societal effects of what they are
doing."
Lawyers point to the negligence of

"big business" and affirm an individ
ual's right to legal protection. The
Ford Pinto case in which fatalities
resulted from faulty designs and the
numerous incidents of product recalls
illustrate this point.
Businesses point to a change of at
titudes that has accompanied increas
ing litigation. America's
entrepreneurial streak is being hin
dered by the public's sue-everyone
in-sight mentality. Says Gust
Headbloom. president of Michigan's
Apex Broach and Machinery Com
pany, "You're afraid to try anything,
put any new product on the market."
A flurry of legislative reforms,
1,200 since last December, have at
tempted to deal with the insurance
crisis. Most of them concern reform
of legal rules such as those involving
tort law. Senator McConnell of Ken
tucky has introduced a bill to es
tablich a $100,000 limit on punitive
damage awards for pain and suffer
ing. Missouri's Senator Danforth has
proposed to set uniform federal
standards in product-liability cases.
Several states are following Cali

fornia's lead in limiting contingency
fees for lawyers in medical
malpractive suits. Such a law awards
an attorney 40 percent of the first
$50,000 of a judgement but then
decreases the share to only 10 per
cent of any amount over $200,000.
Yesterday, Californians voted on
Proposition 51, the so-called deep
pockets initiative. The vote addresses
the question of whether a defendant's
liability for non-economic damages in
personal injury, property damage,
and wrongful death suits be based
only on his degree of fault. Currently,
those who lose a lawsuit can be held
100 percent liable even if they were
only minimally at fault. Thus, plain
tiffs often sue governments and busi
nesses with "deep pockets" of cash
when other defendants, such as unin
sured motorists, are broke.
For instance, drivers may name the
driver at fault plus the municipality
(say for failing to clearly mark a stop
street) in a suit. In the event of multi
million dollar punitive damages, the
municipality, which may only be
found 20 percent at fault, may end up

covering for the amount that the
other parties cannot pay. Proposition
51 would require defendants to pay
high-cost noneconomic damages only
in direct proportion to their degree of
fault.
Proponents claim 51 will correct
the current unfairness and prevent
high liability costs from being handed
down to taxpayers and consumers.
Opponents claim that victims would
no longer get full compensation and
that 51 does not guarantee lower in
surance rates. In fact, they claim that
insurane companies and other sup
porters of 51 want to increase their
profits by saving on damages at the
expense of victims.
The attention given by legislators
to the insurance problem testifies to
its importance. Fundamental changes
in our civil justice system are being
proposed in order to cope with a crisis
that affects a diverse yet large seg
ment of our society. Suddenly, insur
ance coverage is becoming like oil: an
invaluable resource upon which our
dependency is clear only when it
becomes scarce and expensive.
What do the Boy Scouts, a Califor
nia town and the price of ski tickets
have in common? These seemingly
unrelated aspects of American life
are all being adversely affected by
changes in the insurance business. A
country that prides itself upon every
citizen's right to a quick and speedy
trial and to legal redress for griev
ances, America has become an in
creasingly litigious nation.
Suits alleging malpractice or
negligence resulting in personal in
jury have been filed against just
about any activity, business or profes
sion. In fact, between 1974 and 1984,
the number of product-liability suits
in federal courts has increased 680
percent.
Thus, insurance premiums, the fees
paid to buy protection to pay for
settlements, have skyrocketed. The
$9.1 billion that Americans paid in
liability premiums last year is almost
60 percent higher than in 1983.

Insurance is a similar resource to
oil: though vital throughout our soci
ety, it was not thought about much
until enormous price increases. Sud
denly, various segments of our system
are in the grips of what Time maga
zine describes as a "new national
crises." This is illustrated by
anecdotes from Stanford and the rest
of the nation. The challenge is to dis

career may be diconcerted by the fact
that insurance problems have plagued
doctors, lawyers, engineers and mem
bers of corporate boards. Hardest hit
are high-risk medical specialty areas

such as obstetrics and neurosurgery.
According to the American Col
lege of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, 73 percent of its
24,000 members have been sued for
malpractice at least once. Over 3,000
of these members have subsequently
abandoned the specialty. As a result
of high settlements, the typical annual
premium for an obstetrician in Los
Angeles is about $45,000, while
premiums for a neurosurgeon in New
York is about $83,000.
Insurance concerns for Stanford
students mirror those of many

groups. Even a beloved institution
such as the Boy Scouts are not
immune. Soon they will impose a $20
fee on every troop in the country to
help pay liability insurance costs. The
fee is the first of its kind in the Scout's
76-year history and reflects a com
mitment, in the words of their motto,
to "be prepared" for the liability in
surance crisis.
Though the annual number of
claims filed against the organization
has been relatively constant at a mini
scule level, insurance costs have risen
from $2 million is 19H4 to $4 million
in 1985 and $10 million this year.
When the liability policy for the
Northern California seaside village of
Point Arena (population 450)
expired last July, the town officials
were unable to pay for the sudden 50
percent rate hike. The town even
considered posting a sign stating
"Enter at your own risk." Two-thirds
of California's 440 towns and cities
have been predicted to operate with

out insurance by next year.
PROpeace, the anti-nuclear Great
Peace March between Los Angeles
and Washington, D.C., was unable to
obtain a $5 million liability policy re
quired by some municipalities along
the marchers' route. Without such
coverage, PROpeaceniks were
denied the use of a schoolyard where
they had planned to camp for the
night.
Sponsors of public events such as
San Francisco's Chinese New Year
festival have had trouble securing
liability coverage. The main reason:
the unpredicatble nature of claims
made by audience members, on
lookers and participants.
Fhe attempt to discern the cause of
the crisis is very much still in the
finger-pointing stage. The different
players in the insurance dilemma all
point to legitimate faults in the other
parties.
Consumer groups blame the greed

of insurance companies who allegedly
have artificially inflated premiums to
cover for bad policies and poor man
agement. Insurance companies pay
about as much for claims as they col
lect in premiums, yet they make their
profits from investing the premiums.
Such investments paid well five years
age when the interest rate was 21.5
percent. Thus, insurers were more
willing to write risky policies to gain
more premiums to invest at such
lucrative interest rate levels.
However, when interest rates
plummeted and when the risky
policies had to be accounted for, in
surers suffered unprecedented losses.
Over 40 liability insurers have
become insolvent in the past two
years. Thus, premiums have been in
creased.
Insurers point to juries which
award astronomical verdict and to
greedy lawyers. Indeed, the first $1
million settlement did not appear un
til 1962 but now the average suit
exceeds this amount and 1984 saw
$401 million verdicts. Changes in the
law and practices have also contrib

uted to high suits.
The part of a verdict assessed to
compensate (such as for lost wages or
medical bills) is being eclipsed by
payments for non-economic damages
such as pain and suffering. Also,
punitive damages to punish and deter
have skyrocketed. A couple who sued
an insurance company for $1,650
were awarded $3.5 million in punitive
damages, which is 2,121 times the
size of the disputed bill.
Payment to lawyers is also
criticized. A victorious attorney may
collect from 30 to 50 percent of the
total verdict while one who does not
win the case is not paid at all. Thus,
the huge winner-take-all stakes,
which are enormous considering
multi-million dollar suits, may
promote a win-at-all-costs mentality.
Says Edward Levy, general manager
of the Association of California in
surance Companies, "Lawyers are
out to make a buck, and they seem to
have little concern for the overall
societal effects of what they are
doing."
Lawyers point to the negligence of

"big business" and affirm an individ
ual's right to legal protection. The
Ford Pinto case in which fatalities
resulted from faulty designs and the
numerous incidents of product recalls
illustrate this point.
Businesses point to a change of at
titudes that has accompanied increas
ing litigation. America's
entrepreneurial streak is being hin
dered by the public's sue-everyone
in-sight mentality. Says Gust
Headbloom. president of Michigan's
Apex Broach and Machinery Com
pany, "You're afraid to try anything,
put any new product on the market."
A flurry of legislative reforms,
1,200 since last December, have at
tempted to deal with the insurance
crisis. Most of them concern reform
of legal rules such as those involving
tort law. Senator McConnell of Ken
tucky has introduced a bill to es
tablich a $100,000 limit on punitive
damage awards for pain and suffer
ing. Missouri's Senator Danforth has
proposed to set uniform federal
standards in product-liability cases.
Several states are following Cali

fornia's lead in limiting contingency
fees for lawyers in medical
malpractive suits. Such a law awards
an attorney 40 percent of the first
$50,000 of a judgement but then
decreases the share to only 10 per
cent of any amount over $200,000.
Yesterday, Californians voted on
Proposition 51, the so-called deep
pockets initiative. The vote addresses
the question of whether a defendant's
liability for non-economic damages in
personal injury, property damage,
and wrongful death suits be based
only on his degree of fault. Currently,
those who lose a lawsuit can be held
100 percent liable even if they were
only minimally at fault. Thus, plain
tiffs often sue governments and busi
nesses with "deep pockets" of cash
when other defendants, such as unin
sured motorists, are broke.
For instance, drivers may name the
driver at fault plus the municipality
(say for failing to clearly mark a stop
street) in a suit. In the event of multi
million dollar punitive damages, the
municipality, which may only be
found 20 percent at fault, may end up

covering for the amount that the
other parties cannot pay. Proposition
51 would require defendants to pay
high-cost noneconomic damages only
in direct proportion to their degree of
fault.
Proponents claim 51 will correct
the current unfairness and prevent
high liability costs from being handed
down to taxpayers and consumers.
Opponents claim that victims would
no longer get full compensation and
that 51 does not guarantee lower in
surance rates. In fact, they claim that
insurane companies and other sup
porters of 51 want to increase their
profits by saving on damages at the
expense of victims.
The attention given by legislators
to the insurance problem testifies to
its importance. Fundamental changes
in our civil justice system are being
proposed in order to cope with a crisis
that affects a diverse yet large seg
ment of our society. Suddenly, insur
ance coverage is becoming like oil: an
invaluable resource upon which our
dependency is clear only when it
becomes scarce and expensive.
What do the Boy Scouts, a Califor
nia town and the price of ski tickets
have in common? These seemingly
unrelated aspects of American life
are all being adversely affected by
changes in the insurance business. A
country that prides itself upon every
citizen's right to a quick and speedy
trial and to legal redress for griev
ances, America has become an in
creasingly litigious nation.
Suits alleging malpractice or
negligence resulting in personal in
jury have been filed against just
about any activity, business or profes
sion. In fact, between 1974 and 1984,
the number of product-liability suits
in federal courts has increased 680
percent.
Thus, insurance premiums, the fees
paid to buy protection to pay for
settlements, have skyrocketed. The
$9.1 billion that Americans paid in
liability premiums last year is almost
60 percent higher than in 1983.

Insurance is a similar resource to
oil: though vital throughout our soci
ety, it was not thought about much
until enormous price increases. Sud
denly, various segments of our system
are in the grips of what Time maga
zine describes as a "new national
crises." This is illustrated by
anecdotes from Stanford and the rest
of the nation. The challenge is to dis
cern the causes and enact remedies.
Most Stanford students may be
surprised to discover that the insur
ance crisis affects them in many ways.
Aquafollies, an annual outdoor party

held by Lake Lag, was cancelled this
year. Joe Pisano, director of Fraternal
Affairs, cited several compelling
reasons which include the fact that
the 1985 liability premium of $800
would have doubled this year.
Furthermore, the coverage would
have been less comprehensive. Pisano
concluded that a large and open event
such as Aquafollies is difficult to
monitor and is susceptible to lawsuits.
Those students who frequent the
ski resorts may be dismayed about
higher ski ticket prices. After a 100-
inch snow storm in 1982, the Alpine

Meadows ski area closed their lifts
and warned guests against skiing.
However, an avalanche struck the
parking lost and killed 7 people. Al
though a $10 million lawsuit was dis
missed, Alpine Meadows' liability
premium doubled in just I year. This
expense was reflected in ticket price
increases.
