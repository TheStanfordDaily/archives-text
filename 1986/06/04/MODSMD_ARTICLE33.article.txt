# Why no one's sure about insurance anymore

### STEVEN LURIE Staff writer 
What do the Boy Scouts, a Califor
nia town and the price of ski tickets
have in common? These seemingly
unrelated aspects of American life
are all being adversely affected by
changes in the insurance business. A
country that prides itself upon every
citizen's right to a quick and speedy
trial and to legal redress for griev
ances, America has become an in
creasingly litigious nation.
Suits alleging malpractice or
negligence resulting in personal in
jury have been filed against just
about any activity, business or profes
sion. In fact, between 1974 and 1984,
the number of product-liability suits
in federal courts has increased 680
percent.
Thus, insurance premiums, the fees
paid to buy protection to pay for
settlements, have skyrocketed. The
$9.1 billion that Americans paid in
liability premiums last year is almost
60 percent higher than in 1983.

Insurance is a similar resource to
oil: though vital throughout our soci
ety, it was not thought about much
until enormous price increases. Sud
denly, various segments of our system
are in the grips of what Time maga
zine describes as a "new national
crises." This is illustrated by
anecdotes from Stanford and the rest
of the nation. The challenge is to dis
cern the causes and enact remedies.
Most Stanford students may be
surprised to discover that the insur
ance crisis affects them in many ways.
Aquafollies, an annual outdoor party

held by Lake Lag, was cancelled this
year. Joe Pisano, director of Fraternal
Affairs, cited several compelling
reasons which include the fact that
the 1985 liability premium of $800
would have doubled this year.
Furthermore, the coverage would
have been less comprehensive. Pisano
concluded that a large and open event
such as Aquafollies is difficult to
monitor and is susceptible to lawsuits.
Those students who frequent the
ski resorts may be dismayed about
higher ski ticket prices. After a 100-
inch snow storm in 1982, the Alpine

Meadows ski area closed their lifts
and warned guests against skiing.
However, an avalanche struck the
parking lost and killed 7 people. Al
though a $10 million lawsuit was dis
missed, Alpine Meadows' liability
premium doubled in just I year. This
expense was reflected in ticket price
increases.
Students considering a professional
career may be diconcerted by the fact
that insurance problems have plagued
doctors, lawyers, engineers and mem
bers of corporate boards. Hardest hit
are high-risk medical specialty areas

such as obstetrics and neurosurgery.
According to the American Col
lege of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, 73 percent of its
24,000 members have been sued for
malpractice at least once. Over 3,000
of these members have subsequently
abandoned the specialty. As a result
of high settlements, the typical annual
premium for an obstetrician in Los
Angeles is about $45,000, while
premiums for a neurosurgeon in New
York is about $83,000.
Insurance concerns for Stanford
students mirror those of many

groups. Even a beloved institution
such as the Boy Scouts are not
immune. Soon they will impose a $20
fee on every troop in the country to
help pay liability insurance costs. The
fee is the first of its kind in the Scout's
76-year history and reflects a com
mitment, in the words of their motto,
to "be prepared" for the liability in
surance crisis.
Though the annual number of
claims filed against the organization
has been relatively constant at a mini
scule level, insurance costs have risen
from $2 million is 19H4 to $4 million
in 1985 and $10 million this year.
When the liability policy for the
Northern California seaside village of
Point Arena (population 450)
expired last July, the town officials
were unable to pay for the sudden 50
percent rate hike. The town even
considered posting a sign stating
"Enter at your own risk." Two-thirds
of California's 440 towns and cities
have been predicted to operate with
