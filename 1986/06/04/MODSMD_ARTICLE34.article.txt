Koreans talk of constitution change
SEOUL, South Korea — President Chun Doo Hwan said yesterday
that he is willing to permit revision of South Korea's authoritarian con
stitution, and"the sooner, the better," but he drew the line at any fur
ther compromise with the opposition.
Opposition leaders said that Chun had not gone far enough. They said
that they will refuse to join the ruling Democratic Justice Party in setting
up a special legislative committee to revise the constitution unless Chun
agrees to release 1,600 political prisoners.
Leaders of the Democratic Justice Party and the opposition New
Korea Democratic Party had announced agreement last Thursday on
forming such a committee at a special session of the National Assembly
scheduled to be convened Thursday. The committee is scheduled to be
established June 17.
Still, both sides indicated that Chun will announce, before the assem
bly session closes June 24, a schedule for the release of at least some of
the prisoners.
Chun conferred yesterday with Lee Min Woo, president of the New
l'. Korea Democratic Party, in the first one-on-one meeting any president
» of South Korea has ever had with an opposition leader.
According to a senior government official who asked not to be further
; identified, Chun told Lee that the time has come for the opposition party
' "to dissociate itself from pro-Communist and left-leaning radicals" who
have been carrying out violent anti-American, anti-Chun demonstra
tions.
The official said that Chun demanded that Lee's party make clear
whether it is a conservative party or a leftist party. By that, he said, Chun
meant whether the opposition party is willing to work for democratic
reforms within the framework of law and order.
Chun's attack on the opposition party was toned down somewhat in an
official description of the meeting provided by Chung Koo Ho, the presi
dent's press secretary. Chung quoted Chun as telling Lee that "changes
in the constitution should be agreed upon through dialogue and debate
between political parties in the National Assembly."
He said that Chun promised only a limited release of prisoners and
ruled out specifically the only prisoner Lee mentioned by name, the Rev.
Moon Ik Hwan, 68, who was arrested last month on charges of inciting
unrest among students.
Lee told Chun that the New Korea Democratic Party will insist on
revising the Constitution to provide for the direct popular election of a
president to succeed Chun when he steps down on March 2,1988, as re
quired by the present constitution.
U.S. blamed for martial law
WASHINGTON — At a secret, high-level meeting in Warsaw during
early November 1981, a very agitated Soviet official announced to mem
bers of the Polish government and general staff that plans for the up
coming crackdown on the Solidarity trade union were somehow inex
plicably leaking to the United States, according to informed sources
familiar with U.S. intelligence reports. Everyone at this session voiced
dismay, even outrage at the betrayal of such state secrets.
Polish Col. Wladysiaw Kuklinski, a senior staff officer involved in
planning the martial-law crackdown, joined in, expressing particular
shock and distress, the sources said. He then left the meeting and gave a
pre-arranged emergency signal to the Central Intelligence Agency sta
tion in Warsaw. Within hours the colonel, his wife and at least one son
j, were "exfiltrated," the CIA tradecraft name for the undercover extrac
tion of agents in danger.
Kuklinski had been a longtime human asset of the CIA who provided
such superior intelligence about the planned crackdown and forthcom
ing imposition of martial law that the White House had "the operational
blueprint," one source said. At one point, the source said, these plans
were on President Reagan's desk.
In an interview in Warsaw yesterday with a Washington Post corre
spondent, Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban volunteered in
formation about the case, including naming Kuklinski and stating that he
had been deeply involved in planning for martial law.
Urban said Kuklinski had been a CIA spy on the Polish general staff
and claimed that the Reagan administration could have prevented the
imposition of martial law the next month, December 1981, by making
public the then top-secret Polish intentions.
"The U.S. administration could have publicly revealed these plans to
the world and warned Solidarity," Urban said. "Had it done so, the im
plementation of martial law would have been impossible."
The Polish decision to disclose hitherto secret details about Kuklinski,
including revealing his name publicly for the first time, appeared de
signed to bolster the Warsaw government's contention that Reagan
failed to do all he could to help Solidarity and was not interested in a
peaceful solution to the Polish crisis.
U.S. sources denied that this would have been possible because, ac
cording to their account, the only key fact Kuklinski had been unable to
provide was the date the Polish government planned to impose martial
law.
"We had everything in the plan but the day," one U.S. source said,
"and therefore there was no wav to act."
Reagan promotes Saudi arms sale
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, fighting to preserve a narrow
vote margin on Capitol Hill, warned congressional leaders yesterday that
if the Senate overrides his veto and blocks a controversial arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, "it will seriously undermine our foreign policy objectives"
>in the Middle East.
The president needs 34 votes to sustain his veto of an earlier Senate
.action rejecting the weapons package. White House officials said that
they had collected exactly 34 commitments and could not afford to lose a
single vote.
"That's not what you call very good breathing room," presidential as
sistant Dennis Thomas said. "When you've got a margin of error as close
ois that . . . you don't know who's going to have a scheduling problem or
a last-minute concern."
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) emerged from a morning
meeting at the White House to declare that he was "fairly confident"
; Reagan would prevail in the vote, which is scheduled for tomorrow.
"The president's leadership is on the line, particularly as far as
Republicans are concerned," Dole told reporters. "We're running
around the country praising him for his leadership qualities and his 68
percent popularity rating. If we really believe what we say, we ought to
be voting with him on a critical issue like this."
Phillipine rebels gaining strength
WASHINGTON — Senior Reagan Administration officials yester
day.in a surprisingly pessimistic assessment of the Philippine insurgency,
said that the Communist rebels are growing stronger and more violent
despite President Corazon Aquino's call for a cease-fire and reconcilia
tion.
"The military situation is serious, and getting worse, with the Commu
nists enjoying the initiative and assuming de facto control in areas where
government influence has eroded over the years," Richard Armitage,
deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs,
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Despite some military reforms by Aquino, the Philippine army has
been hampered partly because of a recent 14 percent cut in the military
budget, he added.
The rebels "are not coming down from the hills" despite Aquino's
amnesty offer, and recent ambushes by Communist rebels on govern
ment troops "leave little doubt in our mind that, at the end of the day.
military action will be required to defeat the insurgency," Armitage said.

Reagan promotes Saudi arms sale
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, fighting to preserve a narrow
vote margin on Capitol Hill, warned congressional leaders yesterday that
if the Senate overrides his veto and blocks a controversial arms sale to
Saudi Arabia, "it will seriously undermine our foreign policy objectives"
>in the Middle East.
The president needs 34 votes to sustain his veto of an earlier Senate
.action rejecting the weapons package. White House officials said that
they had collected exactly 34 commitments and could not afford to lose a
single vote.
"That's not what you call very good breathing room," presidential as
sistant Dennis Thomas said. "When you've got a margin of error as close
ois that . . . you don't know who's going to have a scheduling problem or
a last-minute concern."
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) emerged from a morning
meeting at the White House to declare that he was "fairly confident"
; Reagan would prevail in the vote, which is scheduled for tomorrow.
"The president's leadership is on the line, particularly as far as
Republicans are concerned," Dole told reporters. "We're running
around the country praising him for his leadership qualities and his 68
percent popularity rating. If we really believe what we say, we ought to
be voting with him on a critical issue like this."
Phillipine rebels gaining strength
WASHINGTON — Senior Reagan Administration officials yester
day.in a surprisingly pessimistic assessment of the Philippine insurgency,
said that the Communist rebels are growing stronger and more violent
despite President Corazon Aquino's call for a cease-fire and reconcilia
tion.
"The military situation is serious, and getting worse, with the Commu
nists enjoying the initiative and assuming de facto control in areas where
government influence has eroded over the years," Richard Armitage,
deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs,
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Despite some military reforms by Aquino, the Philippine army has
been hampered partly because of a recent 14 percent cut in the military
budget, he added.
The rebels "are not coming down from the hills" despite Aquino's
amnesty offer, and recent ambushes by Communist rebels on govern
ment troops "leave little doubt in our mind that, at the end of the day.
military action will be required to defeat the insurgency," Armitage said.
Koreans talk of constitution change
SEOUL, South Korea — President Chun Doo Hwan said yesterday
that he is willing to permit revision of South Korea's authoritarian con
stitution, and"the sooner, the better," but he drew the line at any fur
ther compromise with the opposition.
Opposition leaders said that Chun had not gone far enough. They said
that they will refuse to join the ruling Democratic Justice Party in setting
up a special legislative committee to revise the constitution unless Chun
agrees to release 1,600 political prisoners.
Leaders of the Democratic Justice Party and the opposition New
Korea Democratic Party had announced agreement last Thursday on
forming such a committee at a special session of the National Assembly
scheduled to be convened Thursday. The committee is scheduled to be
established June 17.
Still, both sides indicated that Chun will announce, before the assem
bly session closes June 24, a schedule for the release of at least some of
the prisoners.
Chun conferred yesterday with Lee Min Woo, president of the New
l'. Korea Democratic Party, in the first one-on-one meeting any president
» of South Korea has ever had with an opposition leader.
According to a senior government official who asked not to be further
; identified, Chun told Lee that the time has come for the opposition party
' "to dissociate itself from pro-Communist and left-leaning radicals" who
have been carrying out violent anti-American, anti-Chun demonstra
tions.
The official said that Chun demanded that Lee's party make clear
whether it is a conservative party or a leftist party. By that, he said, Chun
meant whether the opposition party is willing to work for democratic
reforms within the framework of law and order.
Chun's attack on the opposition party was toned down somewhat in an
official description of the meeting provided by Chung Koo Ho, the presi
dent's press secretary. Chung quoted Chun as telling Lee that "changes
in the constitution should be agreed upon through dialogue and debate
between political parties in the National Assembly."
He said that Chun promised only a limited release of prisoners and
ruled out specifically the only prisoner Lee mentioned by name, the Rev.
Moon Ik Hwan, 68, who was arrested last month on charges of inciting
unrest among students.
Lee told Chun that the New Korea Democratic Party will insist on
revising the Constitution to provide for the direct popular election of a
president to succeed Chun when he steps down on March 2,1988, as re
quired by the present constitution.
U.S. blamed for martial law
WASHINGTON — At a secret, high-level meeting in Warsaw during
early November 1981, a very agitated Soviet official announced to mem
bers of the Polish government and general staff that plans for the up
coming crackdown on the Solidarity trade union were somehow inex
plicably leaking to the United States, according to informed sources
familiar with U.S. intelligence reports. Everyone at this session voiced
dismay, even outrage at the betrayal of such state secrets.
Polish Col. Wladysiaw Kuklinski, a senior staff officer involved in
planning the martial-law crackdown, joined in, expressing particular
shock and distress, the sources said. He then left the meeting and gave a
pre-arranged emergency signal to the Central Intelligence Agency sta
tion in Warsaw. Within hours the colonel, his wife and at least one son
j, were "exfiltrated," the CIA tradecraft name for the undercover extrac
tion of agents in danger.
Kuklinski had been a longtime human asset of the CIA who provided
such superior intelligence about the planned crackdown and forthcom
ing imposition of martial law that the White House had "the operational
blueprint," one source said. At one point, the source said, these plans
were on President Reagan's desk.
In an interview in Warsaw yesterday with a Washington Post corre
spondent, Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban volunteered in
formation about the case, including naming Kuklinski and stating that he
had been deeply involved in planning for martial law.
Urban said Kuklinski had been a CIA spy on the Polish general staff
and claimed that the Reagan administration could have prevented the
imposition of martial law the next month, December 1981, by making
public the then top-secret Polish intentions.
"The U.S. administration could have publicly revealed these plans to
the world and warned Solidarity," Urban said. "Had it done so, the im
plementation of martial law would have been impossible."
The Polish decision to disclose hitherto secret details about Kuklinski,
including revealing his name publicly for the first time, appeared de
signed to bolster the Warsaw government's contention that Reagan
failed to do all he could to help Solidarity and was not interested in a
peaceful solution to the Polish crisis.
U.S. sources denied that this would have been possible because, ac
cording to their account, the only key fact Kuklinski had been unable to
provide was the date the Polish government planned to impose martial
law.
"We had everything in the plan but the day," one U.S. source said,
"and therefore there was no wav to act."
