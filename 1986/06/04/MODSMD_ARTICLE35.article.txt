MOSCOW â€” A total of 18,000 persons in the
Chernobyl area were briefly hospitalized with sus
picious symptoms after the world's worst nuclear
accident but they showed no signs of radiation sick
ness, a Soviet doctor said yesterday.
These patients all were released after a few days,
according to Dr. Leonid Ilyin, head of a Moscow
hospital which is treating some of the most
seriously injured victims.
His statement at a news conference was the first
indication of the number of persons requiring
medical attention after the release of radiation
from the Chernobyl reactor in the Ukraine starting
last April 26.
Meantime, the death toll from the nuclear acci
dent rose to 25, Deputy Health Minister Yevgeny
Chazov said, with another 30 persons listed in
"critical" condition.
Ilyin said 89 of the 299 persons reported to have
received the most serious doses of radiation have
been discharged from the hospital already.

The 18,000 people hospitalized complained of a
variety of ailments, including headaches, coughing
spells and respiratory problems, and some were
spitting blood, he said.
"None of those examined displayed radiation
sickness," Ilyin said. In all, he said, a total of
100,000 persons from the Chernobyl area were
tested for radiation by doctors in the surrounding
area.
Soviet television viewers were given their first
look at some of the hospitalized firemen who
battled the blaze at the Chernobyl reactor when ra
diation levels were at their peak.
Film shown on the nightly television news, taken
in a Moscow hospital, indicated that several of the
firefighters had lost their hair, a common result of
radiation exposure.
In another development, the official news agency
Tass said about 260 families evacuated from the
Chernobyl danger zone were now ready to return
after decontamination work had been completed.

The families were going back to the villages of
Glinki, Zamoshye and Bychki in the Kiev region,
the Tass report said. Farming has been resumed in
Chernobyl district, the news agency also reported.
The most intensive phase of decontamination
work in the Chernobyl power plant settlement has
been concluded, according to Lev Ryabev, a mem
ber of the government commission named to look
into the disaster.
A special solution is being used in areas with
higher than normal radioactivity, he said. After it
solidifies and absorbs dust and small fragments, the
resulting film is removed and buried, Ryabev told
Ogonyok magazine.
Ryabev's statement indicated that experts are
still working on a plan to build a huge concrete cof
fin for the damaged reactor to prevent it from
leaking radiation again.
"Miners and subway construction workers are
carrying out preparations for placing the entire
structure on a thick concrete plate," TASS said.
