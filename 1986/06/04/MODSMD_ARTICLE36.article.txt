# Fighting in Lebanon kills 20
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Battles be
tween Sunni and Shiite Moslem
militiamen raged through the night
and most of the day yesterday in the
streets of West Beirut, overshadow
ing at least temporarily a 3-week-old
fight for control of three Palestinian
refugee camps in the southern part of
the city.
In the heaviest fighting in West
Beirut this year, hospital sources
could give only preliminary casualty
figures because rescue teams and
firefighters could not get near the
area. At least 20 people were re
ported dead and 80 wounded with the
number expect to rise. The death toll
in the camps is reported to have
reached more than 70, with about
750 wounded.

Shiite militiamen appeared to have
the upper hand in fierce inter-
Moslem conflict in West Beirut. A
Shiite Amal movement spokesman
announced that its men had taken
ove-r the headquarters of a major
Sunni Moslem activitist, Chaker Ber
jawi, who is sympathetic to Palestin
ian concerns. Amal spokesmen
accused Palestinian guerrillas of
joining the Sunnis in the fighting.
Syrian efforts to contain the crisis
proved ineffective, and commentary
in the local media said the conflict
was an extension of hostilities be
tween Shiite and Palestinians inside
the.embattled refugee shantytowns.
Gunmen were heavily scattered in
residential areas in the Sunni Moslem
Tariq Jedideh area, following fierce

rocket and mortar duels that erupted
Monday and set buildings aflame.
The fighting there threatened 2,000
children at a nearby orphanage and
trapped much of the staff at the
Maqassed hospital indoors.
"Two thousand children are in real
danger and we will have a disaster on
our hands if food supplies cannot be
brought to the orphanage home and
the siege around us is not lifted," a
statement from the orphanage, read
over the Sunni-run Voice of the
Homeland said. "The children are
terrified and there is a shortage of
workers, medicines and relief. ... We
beg you to stop firing around us ... in
the name of humanity."
The fighting added to the city's
slow slide into anarchy, which has

drained it of many of its diplomats,
international relief workers, bankers,
doctors, journalists, and academics.
The atmosphere affected local gun
men as well who opened fire with
mortars and machine guns yesterday
at the slightest movement, even the
fluttering of crows perched over the
fresh bread Tined in front of the few
bakeries that remained open.
Lebanon Prime Minister Rashid
Karami and Education Minister
Selim Hoss appealed to Syrian Vice
President Abdul Halim Khaddam to
stop the fighting and put an end to
"Beirut's tragedies."
A Shiite Amal leader and South
Lebanon Minister Nabih Berri re
quested that the Lebanese army and
police force move into the streets.
