Critics attack Reagan
WASHINGTON — Fresh bipartisan criticism
surfaced on both sides of Capitol Hill yesterday
over President Reagan's announcement that the
United States will end compliance with the un
ratified SALT 2 treaty later this year.
At a White House meeting with other Republi
can congressional leaders. Sen. John Chafee (R-
R. 1.) said he voiced his "extreme distress" over
the decision, warning Reagan that if the United
States scraps the treaty, "they (the Soviets) are
going to be way ahead."
While Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) and Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) backed the
president, GOP moderates such as Sens. David
Durenberger of Minnesota and Lowell Weicker
Jr. of Connecticut said they were concerned
about a reversal of the Administration's five-year
policy of adhering to the terms of the unratified
arms accord with the Soviets.
By renouncing the treaty now, Weicker said,
"we will lose an enormous opportunity at a time
when the Soviets are at the short end of world
opinion" because of the Chernobyl nuclear dis
aster.
Meanwhile, Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.)
predicted that there will be "a major effort'' in
the Senate to force Reagan to change his mind
before the end of the year, when the Administra
tion says this country will exceed SALT 2 limits.
"I cannot see one single thing that benefits the
U.S., militarily or any other way, from this deci
sion." Bumpers said. "Talk about shooting your
self in the foot."
Court extends rights
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
strengthening the constitutional right to confront
an accuser, ruled yesterday that an accomplice's
confession implicating a fellow defendant is
"inherently unreliable" and ordinarily may not
be used as evidence against that defendant.

In a 5-4 decision, the justices set aside the
double-murder conviction of an Illinois woman
that had been based in part on the pretrial
confession of her boyfriend, who was tried with
her but did not take the witness stand and could
not be cross-examined.
"The right to confront and to cross-examine
witnesses is primarily a functional right that
promotes reliability in criminal trials," Justice
William Brennan Jr. wrote for the majority.
In this case, Brennan said, "there is no occa
sion to depart from the time-honored teaching
that a co-defendant's confession incriminating
the accused is inherently unreliable and that con
victions supported by such evidence violate the
constitutional right of confrontation."
Dissenters, in an opinion by Justice Harry
Blackmun, said the court was disregarding the
"significant realities" that characterize criminal
cases, and that the statement at issue was reliable
and should be held admissible.
The decision represented a strong reaffirma
tion of previous rulings broadening the Sixth
Amendment right of defendants to question their
accusers.
Pelton testimony ends
BALTIMORE — Testimony ended yesterday
in the espionage trial of Ronald Pelton as he
completed two days on the stand, asserting that
two FBI agents led him to believe he would not
be arrested.
Today, both sides are scheduled to make
closing arguments, with the case then going to the
12-member jury, which has been sequestered
throughout the trial, going to the jury, which has
been sequestered throughout the trial.
Pelton, a former communications specialist
with the National Security Agency, said that the
agents who interrogated him for five hours last
November before arresting him had "made it
rather plain" that he was in no danger of arrest.
Pelton, 44. who earned $24,500 annually at
NSA when he resigned after 14 years with the
super-secret agency, is accused of selling
sensitive national securitv data to the Soviet Un-

ion for $35,000. He has admitted to selling the
material, but he asserts that he was tricked into
confessing and was not informed of his right to
remain silent.
In his questioning on the trial's sixth day,
Douglass tried to portray Pelton as a liar who
knew he faced prosecution and was attempting to
make a deal with the agents through "bluffs,"
"probes" and "bargaining chips."
States hold primaries
WASHINGTON — South Dakota Republican
Sen. James Abdnor narrowly defeated the state's
Republican Gov. William Janklow for their
party's U.S. Senate nomination yesterday in a
contest that highlighted intraparty competition
for statewide offices in four states in the Midwest,
South and Southwest.
Elsewhere, Democrats vied for gubernatorial
and senatorial nominations in Alabama and
lowa, while Republicans competed for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination in New Mexico.
Of those races, the primary in South Dakota
commanded the most national attention because
the seat held by Abdnor was one Democrats
were particularly hopeful of capturing this No
vember in their effort to gain control of the Sen
ate, where the Republicans now hold a 53-47
edge.
Democratic Rep. Thomas Daschle, the state's
only congressman, was unopposed for the Demo
cratic Senate nomination, and polls indicated that
he would be a formidable candidate.
Stocks gain slightly
NEW YORK — The stock market, encour
aged by hopes of lower interest rates, chalked up
a modest gain after posting losses for most of the

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had dropped back 14.76 points on Mon
day, rose by 8.48 points to close at 1870.43 in
lackluster trading.
