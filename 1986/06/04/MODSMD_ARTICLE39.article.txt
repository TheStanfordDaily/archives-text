# Boston downs Houston
## 
### 
HOUSTON — Larry Bird, quiet
for most of the second half, hit a
three-point shot from the top of the
circle with 2:26 left, to give Boston
the lead for good and the Celtics
pulled within one victory of their 16th
NBA title with a 106-103 victory
over the Houston Rockets last night.
The Celtics take a 3-1 lead in the
best-of-seven championship series
into the fifth game at The Summit to
morrow night.
No team has ever come back from
a 3-1 deficit in the finals, although it
has happened four times in earlier
playoff rounds.
After Bird gave Boston a 104-101
lead with his three-point bomb, only
two baskets were scored the
remainder of the game. Rodney
McCray scored on a rebound with
2:04 left to make it 104-103 but
those were the last points for the
Rockets.
Bill Walton scored on a rebound at
1:39 and the Celtics stifled Houston
with steals by Danny Ainge and
Kevin McHale in the final seconds.
Bird scored only seven of his 21
points in the second half. Dennis
Johnson and Robert Parish led Bos
ton with 22 points each while McHale
had 19. Ralph Sampson had 25
points, Akeem Olajuwon 20 points
and 14 rebounds and Robert Reid 19
points for Houston.

The Houston Rockets had hoped to
get-even in the NBA finals against the
Boston Celtics last night.
The Rockets pulled back from the
brink of elimination by outscoring the
Celtics 12-2 in the final three minutes
Sunday to win 106-104 and avoid a
3-0 deficit in the best-of-7 champion
ship series.
"We really haven't played a top
game yet, and we're only down 2-1,"
Houston's Akeem Olajuwon said
before the game. "1 know I didn't
play as well as I could have Sunday.
They really haven't seen me and
Ralph (Sampson) playing at our best
in the same game. They haven't seen
what Lewis Lloyd can really do.
Before Tuesday's game, the Celtic*
defended teammate Larry Bird's per
formance in Game 3. The regular
season Most Valuable Player was 3-
for-12 from the field in the second
half and finished with 25 points after
scoring 19 in the first half.
"Larry is going to be pretty upset,"
Celtics guard Danny Ainge said. "But
he was a victim of his teammates. We
gave him the ball in a lot of bad situa
tions.
"We were passing him the ball with
just five or six seconds on the clock.
We need to get him the ball a little
quicker. 1 don't think anyone can
cover him if we get him the ball with
15 or 16 seconds on the clock."
