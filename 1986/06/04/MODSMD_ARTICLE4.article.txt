## New Western Culture class possible 
### ELAINE RIGGS Editorial staff 
There may be a new Western Cul
ture class focussing on the contribu
tions of minorities and women as
early as next spring quarter.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) yesterday recom
mended a proposal that the new
course be offered as an alternative to
regular spring quarter Western Cul
ture classes for students in all tracks.
The drafted proposal is slated to be
submitted to the Western Culture
Committee by Sept. 15. and the
final decision on the proposal will be
due on Nov. 1.
"The ' -US can only give a recom
mendation — it can't make the deci
sions." -US member and Biology
Prof. C; ig Heller said. "(But) there
is considerable support and enthusi
asm for what you're asking."
"You might fear thai ihis course
will be voted down. I don't think
that's«likely," C-US member and En
glish Prof. Ron Rebholz said.
History Prof. Clay Carson will
design the course, slated to be open
to students in any Western Culture
sequence. Anthropology Prof.
Renato Rosaldo will help him during
the summer, along with interested
students and faculty.
The C-US also approved a task
force to examine long-term alterna
tives to the current Western Culture
program. Members will be appointed
by Provost James Rosse.
Members of student minority
groups submitted a memo to the C
US yesterday outlining their objec
tives The memo calls for the course
to begin next year.
"While generally such classes are
approved only after a complete syl
labus is devised, the urgency of the
moment makes this a unique situa
tion." the memo reads.

"For the sake of the class of 1990.
it is imperative that the C-US not let
unresolved — but resolvable
details stand in the way," it states.
Members of the Black Student Un
ion who were present expressed satis
faction with the C-US' reception of
their recommendation.
"I would characterize this as a suc
cess," said Amanda Kemp, chair ot
the BSU.
Asked if the third-quarter alterna
tive course was the students' original
objective, Kemp replied that it was
not.
"The BSU wants a world culture
program. But there are many steps
you take in that direction, and this is
one step on the way to fundamentally
restructuring the program," she said.
"It's not going to be 'let's go home
now,' " she said. "We're going to see
it through."
Carson said that he. too, regards
the class as a "stepping-stone
towards a world culture program
"1 think Stanford students need to
be educated regarding cultural diver
sity m the world. I think they need the
kind of education that will allow them
to assume leadership in the 21st cen
tury in a world that's predominately
non-white and non-Christian, and
look back on traditions that are non-
European," he said.
The meeting yesterday was organ
ized in response to recent criticism of
the Western Culture program and a
call for action by University President
Donald Kennedy.
"I have told the BSU all along that
I favor change," Kennedy said yester
day. "I'm happy to leave those deci
sions to the people in charge, but they
have to give some serious considera
tion to change."
