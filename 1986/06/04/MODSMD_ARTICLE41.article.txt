MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican soccer fans
flocked to Aztec Stadium to support their na
tional team's World Cup debut yesterday, then
celebrated the 2-1 victory over Belgium by danc
ing, singing and partying in the streets.
Before a crowd of 110,000, which rocked the
massive stadium every time the Mexicans did
something positive. Fernando Quirante and na
tional soccer hero Hugo Sanchez scored goals.
Mexico then held off the Belgians, who got a goal
by Erwin Vandenbergh late in the first half but
could not produce anything more.
When the host team took the field, it was met
with a thunderous ovation. That roar grew even
louder when Quirante, a defender who moved up
to attack, headed home a free kick by captain
Tomas Boy at 23 minutes.
Then Sanchez, the star striker, put in a header
after Boy's corner kick was headed to him by
Javier Aguirre.
Sanchez, who plays for Spanish powerhouse
Real Madrid, then turned a cartwheel in celebra
tion.
The Belgians came back on Vandenbergh"s
goal late in the first half but never came close to
tying the score.
At Monterrey, Portugal upset England with a
1 -0 victory.
The British messed up most of their oppor
tunties on offense by overpassing. Portugal,

meanwhile, played conservatively, beginning the
game with only one striker.
I'he Portuguese got the only goal in the 75th
minute when midfielder Carlos Manuel — whose
goal against West Germany qualified Portugal
for this event — was left unguarded in front of
the net. He took a pass from Diamantino, who
had raced down the right side, and put it in with
his left foot.

At Guadalajara, Northern Ireland tied with
Algeria 1 -1.
The Irish took an early lead when Norman
Whiteside's free kick went off a defender in the
Algerian wall and into the net. But Djamel
Zidane tied it on a free kick in the 58th minute
when he beat diving goalie Pat Jennings low to
the left.
"We had an early goal that gave us confidence
and we had two more clear chances," Billy Bin

gham. Northern Ireland's coach, said. "It we had
taken advantage of those chances, Algeria would
have been dead and buried."
But the Irish appeared to tire late in the game
and Algeria controlled the final 25 minutes.
