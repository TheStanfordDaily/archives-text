## Golfers miss NCAA cut, end up 25th 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Ten strokes over three days may not seem like
very much, but it was enough to prevent the Stan
ford men's golf team from making the cut at the
NCAA Championship in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Needing to be in at least a tie for 20th place in or
der to play in the fourth and final round, the Card
inal shot 297 as a team Friday to leave it in 25th
place. Stanford's 54-hole total of 905 was 10
strokes shy of qualifying.
Wake Forest came from behind to defeat top
ranked Oklahoma State by four strokes for the na
tional championship, though OSU's Scott Verplank
captured the individual crown. Wake Forest was 12
swings behind OSU going into Saturday's play, but
made it all up and then some to finish with a four
over-par score of 1,156.
"I was really surprised, as was everybody else,
that they won," Stanford's Carl Wagner said. "They
had a bad third round and everybody thought they
were out of it. . . . It's really pretty amazing.''
Oklahoma, a co-leader with Wake Forest after
the first round, wound up third at 1,163. Brigham
Young finished fourth at 1,167 while Houston was
fifth, two shots behind BYU. Miami, Lamar,
Arizona State, USC and Louisiana State rounded
out the top 10.
Wagner said that Verplank may have had a little
more incentive to win the individual title after
losing out to USC's Sam Randolph the night before
the tournament started in the vote for player of the
year.
"I know he really wanted to win the nationals be
cause he hadn't won them in his four years," Wag
ner said. "He just went out and did it."
Verplank roared out to a four-stroke lead with
68's on the first two days at the par-72, 7,079-yard
Bermuda Run Golf Course, then maintained that
margin despite shooting 73's Friday and Saturday
and wound up with a six-over-par 282. Randolph
finished tied for Bth at 288.
Houston's Mike Standly fired a 70 Saturday to
leap from a ninth-place tie into the silver-medal po
sition. Georgia Tech's Nacho Gervas, Weber State's
Carito Villaroman, LSU's Emlyn Aubrey and
Florida's Andy Zulio knotted for third at 287, one
behind Standly.
Pacific 10 Conference champion Don Walsworth
was the only Cardinal to qualify for
the fourth round. After offering
rounds of 74 and 70 the first two
days, Walsworth shot 75 and 77 to
end up at 296. .
"I was in good position after the
second round," Walworth said. "The
last two days weren't quite as good as
I had hoped, especially the last day.

Overall, I'm not extremely disap
pointed or extremely pleased."
Wagner produced his best round of
the tournament Friday, an even-par
72, for a 54-hole total of 225. Fresh
men Brad Geer and Roger Miraglia
each shot 75's to finish at 229 and
235, respectively. Phil Rowley wound
up his collegiate career with a 241.
"I think we went there knowing we
would have to play well to make the
cut," Wagner said. "We seemed to
find a way to lose a couple of strokes
here or there. It just didn't quite hap

pen (for us)."
"We should have been able to
make the cut," Walsworth said. "I
think the last few holes on the second
day really killed us. We just didn't
groove together. I think (Geer and
Miraglia) were a little intimidated to
begin with. 1 think they'll do a lot bet
ter next time."
Wagner also pointed to the end of
the second round as a crucial point in
the tournament. Stanford shot seven
over-par on the last three holes of
that round.

"We should have been able to
make the cut," Walsworth said. "I
think the last few holes on the second
day really killed us. We just didn't

Miraglia) were a little intimidated to
begin with. 1 think they'll do a lot bet
ter next time."
Wagner also pointed to the end of
the second round as a crucial point in
the tournament. Stanford shot seven
over-par on the last three holes of
that round.
