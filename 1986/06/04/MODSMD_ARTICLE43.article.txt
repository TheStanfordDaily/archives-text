# Stanford falters on final day
## 
### JON WEISMAN Staff writer 
Top-ranked Florida won the 1986
NCAA women's golf championship
in Columbus, Ohio, while Stanford
finished a disappointing 15th out of
17 teams.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal, which
was in the middle of the pack going
into Saturday's final round despite a
poor opening day, plummeted in the
standings after a mediocre perfor
mance.
Stanford was tied with No. 10 Ken
tucky for 11th after 54 holes, but
while the Wildcats shot 288 in the
final round to finish tied for fifth with
second-ranked Tulsa, Stanford
produced its worst round of the
tournament, 314, to end up at 1,232,
52 strokes behind Florida.
"They (Florida) just have five very
strong players that play with a lot of
confidence and a lot of momentum,"
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said.
"We just don't have the firepower
Florida and Miami do — they're just
really loaded."
No. 14 Miami failed in its attempt
to upset Florida, finishing eight be
hind the champions at 1,188. Follow
ing Miami were Stanford's Pac-West
rivals USC and Arizona State, finish
ing third and fourth at 1,202 and
1,205, respectively.
"They (Miami) were really a
surprise," Baldwin said. "They do
have outstanding players. A couple of
them played the best golf of their
lives; that's what did it for them. All
five (Miami players) had very good
tournaments."
Florida also had the individual
champion in Page Dunlop. Dunlop's
one-under-par 291 edged out both
ASU's Michelle Estill and New
Mexico's Caroline Keggi by a single
swing to win what Baldwin has called
"the No. 1 women's amateur
championship in the world."
Stanford was led by Julie Carmich
ael, who played strongly for the first
three rounds of the NCAAs but then
struggled Saturday, shooting an 80 to
finish at 314.
"The weather (Saturday) was ex
cellent, and the course was excel
lent," Baldwin said. "Julie Carmich

ael was even-par for the first seven
holes. I was looking for her to shoot a
70 and move into the top five of the
tournament. "She went into a
stretch of, say the seventh, eighth,
ninth and 10th — those four holes
she went five over par," he said. "It
was just a very unfriendly stretch to
her. Our team was looking for a top
-10 finish, and there was a 10-shot
swing just in her alone."
Kathleen McCarthy was the only
Cardinal to stay below 80 throughout
the tournament, winding up at 309.
Kay Cornelius suffered through an 83
Friday to raise her score to 314, while
Kathy Kostas finshed right behind
her at 315. Adrienne Gilmartin
bounced back from a poor start to
conclude the event at 3 17.
"Kathleen McCarthy played
okay," Baldwin said. "She's had a
rough year; we were hoping she
would play better. We were hoping
Kay Cornelius would play a lot bet
ter.
"We'd hoped (Kostas') being a
senior, she would finish out her col
legiate career on a little stronger
note. ... 1 thought (Gilmartin)
played really well, the middle two
rounds especially."
Stanford had developed a pattern
this year of starting off slowly and
finishing fast. That was exactly what
seemed to be happening in Columbus
as the Cardinal came back from an
opening-round 310 with a 300
Thursday.
It looked like Stanford's improve
ment was continuing in the third
round, but the team faltered on the
last few holes to end the day at 308.
This may have set thr tone for Satur
day.
"I've looked at this 18 billion dif
ferent ways," Baldwin said. "We
played 20 rounds (among the five
players), and we had eight rounds
that I would call acceptable: two 745,
two 75s and four 765."
"Our overall performance was just
a very average performance,"
Baldwin said. "We had a couple of
decent performances (individually),
but we didn't get a couple of hot
players."
Florida's Dunlop, Baldwin noted,
was that team's No. 4 player.

seemed to be happening in Columbus
as the Cardinal came back from an
opening-round 310 with a 300
Thursday.
It looked like Stanford's improve
ment was continuing in the third
round, but the team faltered on the
last few holes to end the day at 308.
This may have set thr tone for Satur
day.
"I've looked at this 18 billion dif
ferent ways," Baldwin said. "We
played 20 rounds (among the five
players), and we had eight rounds
that I would call acceptable: two 745,
two 75s and four 765."
"Our overall performance was just
a very average performance,"
Baldwin said. "We had a couple of
decent performances (individually),
but we didn't get a couple of hot
players."
Florida's Dunlop, Baldwin noted,
was that team's No. 4 player.

With a four-day total of 315, Kathy Kostas helped Stanford to a 15th-place finish in the
NCAA Championship.
Top-ranked Florida won the 1986
NCAA women's golf championship
in Columbus, Ohio, while Stanford
finished a disappointing 15th out of
17 teams.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal, which
was in the middle of the pack going
into Saturday's final round despite a
poor opening day, plummeted in the
standings after a mediocre perfor
mance.
Stanford was tied with No. 10 Ken
tucky for 11th after 54 holes, but
while the Wildcats shot 288 in the
final round to finish tied for fifth with
second-ranked Tulsa, Stanford
produced its worst round of the
tournament, 314, to end up at 1,232,
52 strokes behind Florida.
"They (Florida) just have five very
strong players that play with a lot of
confidence and a lot of momentum,"
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said.
"We just don't have the firepower
Florida and Miami do — they're just
really loaded."
No. 14 Miami failed in its attempt
to upset Florida, finishing eight be
hind the champions at 1,188. Follow
ing Miami were Stanford's Pac-West
rivals USC and Arizona State, finish
ing third and fourth at 1,202 and
1,205, respectively.
"They (Miami) were really a
surprise," Baldwin said. "They do
have outstanding players. A couple of
them played the best golf of their
lives; that's what did it for them. All
five (Miami players) had very good
tournaments."
Florida also had the individual
champion in Page Dunlop. Dunlop's
one-under-par 291 edged out both
ASU's Michelle Estill and New
Mexico's Caroline Keggi by a single
swing to win what Baldwin has called
"the No. 1 women's amateur
championship in the world."
Stanford was led by Julie Carmich
ael, who played strongly for the first
three rounds of the NCAAs but then
struggled Saturday, shooting an 80 to
finish at 314.
"The weather (Saturday) was ex
cellent, and the course was excel
lent," Baldwin said. "Julie Carmich

ael was even-par for the first seven
holes. I was looking for her to shoot a
70 and move into the top five of the
tournament. "She went into a
stretch of, say the seventh, eighth,
ninth and 10th — those four holes
she went five over par," he said. "It
was just a very unfriendly stretch to
her. Our team was looking for a top
-10 finish, and there was a 10-shot
swing just in her alone."
Kathleen McCarthy was the only
Cardinal to stay below 80 throughout
the tournament, winding up at 309.
Kay Cornelius suffered through an 83
Friday to raise her score to 314, while
Kathy Kostas finshed right behind
her at 315. Adrienne Gilmartin
bounced back from a poor start to
conclude the event at 3 17.
"Kathleen McCarthy played
okay," Baldwin said. "She's had a
rough year; we were hoping she
would play better. We were hoping
Kay Cornelius would play a lot bet
ter.
"We'd hoped (Kostas') being a
senior, she would finish out her col
legiate career on a little stronger
note. ... 1 thought (Gilmartin)
played really well, the middle two
rounds especially."
Stanford had developed a pattern
this year of starting off slowly and
finishing fast. That was exactly what
seemed to be happening in Columbus
as the Cardinal came back from an
opening-round 310 with a 300
Thursday.
It looked like Stanford's improve
ment was continuing in the third
round, but the team faltered on the
last few holes to end the day at 308.
