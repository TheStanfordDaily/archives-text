# It's been a banner year for Card sports

Stanford often likes to compare itself to
Harvard, and a number of parallels can be
drawn between these two stellar academic in
stitutions on opposite sides of the country.
In one area, though, the comparison is
laughable. The Crimson could not even set
foot on the same athletic field with the Card
inal.
With four NCAA team championships (the
most of any Division I school) and 16 individ
ual titlists, Stanford dominated the national
sports scene during the 1985-86 academic
year.
The Farm even went international — fresh
man Debi Thomas captivated audiences
everywhere while winning the world figure
skating championship in Geneva, Switzer
land.
Water polo got the ball rolling by taking the
NCAA championship on the first day of
December with a 12-11 overtime victory over
UC-Irvine. It was the Cardinal's fifth water
polo national title, and Stanford Coach Dante
Dettamanti called it "probably the most excit
ing game ever in NCAA history."
Sophomore Matt Tingler scored on a lob
with five seconds left to send the game into
overtime and added the winning tally in the
last minute of the extra stanza. Stanford's

Dave Imbernino shared MVP honors with
UC-Irvine's Jeff Campbell and notched three
goals in the final game.
Craig Klass was named first-team All-
Tournament, and Todd Kemp and Jaime
Velez were second-team selections.
It looked like Stanford would cop another
title when its women's volleyball team en
tered the NCAAs with a 25-2 record and the
nation's No. 1 ranking. However, the Card
inal lost in the title match for the second year
in a row, this time to the University of the
Pacific, 17-15,7-15, 12-15, 13-15.
For standout senior Kim Oden, the game
marked the end of a storied career on the
Farm. Oden was a four-time All-American
and a two;time national player of the year.
Prior to her arrival, Stanford had never
reached the NCAA Final Four, but the team
went in each of her four years here, making
Stanford the only team to do so in that period.
After an 82-58 mauling of defending
NCAA champion Texas at DeGuerre Pool,
the women's swimming team was one of the
favorites for the national crown. The
Longhorns' depth prevailed in Little Rock,
Ark., however, as they won their third
straight title, and Stanford took third behind
Florida.
The young Cardinal was pleased with its
finish nonetheless, and Stanford Coach
George Haines said "we swam as good as we

could possibly swim."
Stanford freshman Jenna Johnson was
voted the meet's outstanding swimmer and
accumulated 77 points. Johnson was devastat
ing en route to winning the 100-yard butter
fly, 100 freestyle, 50 freestyle and placing
second in the 200 freestyle. She also teamed
with Jennifer Pokluda, Kathy Smith and
Diana Zock on the winning 200 medley relay
and with Zock, Aimee Berzins and Smith on a
champion 200 freestyle squad. Susan Rapp
brought home a title also, in the 200 individ
ual medley.
Pablo Morales was similarly outstanding in
the men's meet as he led Stanford to the
NCAA championship for the second year in a
row. Morales won the 100 butterfly, 200 but
terfly and 200 individual medley while team
ming with Sean Murphy, John Moffet and
Dave Lundberg on a first-place 400 medley
relay squad.
Also copping individual titles were Murphy
in the 200 backstroke, Moffet in the 200
breaststroke and Jeff Kosloff in the 1,650
freestyle.
"Winning the NCAAs this year is more
gratifying than it was last year," Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney said. "It was a five-team
battle, there was a lot of pressure not to make
mistakes."
The men's gymnastics team was also in
volved in a tight battle in Lincoln, Neb., but

after qualifying for the finals it let Arizona
State and Nebraska fight it out for first and
settled for third. Still, the finish was by far the
highest in school history, and it came in only
the second appearance in the national meet
for the squad.
Jon Louis closed out his Stanford career in
style by copping the individual crown with a
56.60 score. Louis also took the Pacific 10
Conference title.
Stanford junior Patty Fendick didn't get her
conference's player of the year award — the
Pac-West honor went to USC's Caroline
Kuhlman — but, like Louis, she did win an
NCAA individual title. Fendick also led her
her team to an NCAA championship.
Fendick was on fire throughout both the
team and individual NCA As. She never lost a
match in Austin, Texas and defeated several
highly regarded players, including Beverly
Bowes of Texas, Kuhlman and final foe
Gretchen Rush of Trinity, 2-6, 6-1, 6-3.
Fendick was supported by a loaded Stan
ford lineup that was able to replace injured
freshman Eleni Rossides midway through the
season without breaking stride, finishing with
a 21-1 record.
Dan Goldie, perhaps taking a cue from
Fendick, won the men's singles title a day
later in Athens, Ga. after also leading his
squad to the team championship. For Goldie

and senior teammates Eric Rosenfeld, John
Letts and Jim Grabb the title completed a
cycle that began when they wore the crown as
freshmen.
The four seniors, joined by sophomore
Patrick McEnroe and junior Scott Moody,
silenced the doubters who had questioned
them after the Cardinal lost five regular
season matches, although several of those
defeats came while an injured Grabb was
unable to play at No. 2 singles.
"This year we had a lot of trials and tribula
tions," said Stanford Coach Dick Gould
whose team won for the sixth time in the last
nine years. "But these guys stayed with it and
hung tough."
Although they did not win national cham
pionships, several other Stanford teams re
corded high NCAA finishes. Jennifer Yu led
the women's fencing team to an unblemished
13-0 record and a seventh-place finish in na
tionals. Jennifer's cousin Elliot Cheu helped
the male fencers compile a 21-1 tally. Their
only loss came at the hands of Big Ten cham
pion Illinois, and they wound up 14th in the
NCAAs.
In women's crew, the varsity-eight capped
off a strong season with a second place at the
Pacific Coast Championships.
