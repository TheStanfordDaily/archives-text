### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
While the rest of the campus will have a few
more days to pack up and prepare for exams, 11
Stanford track and field athletes will begin their
final tests this afternoon in Indianapolis, Ind. at
the NCAA championships.
It's been an up-and-down year for Cardinal
track, but shining through it all have been some
consistent performers. They've come through
all season, and again they'll be the key for the
Cardinal in Indianapolis.
For the women's team, the key performers
will be the throwers. Together, seniors Pam
Dukes and Karen Nickerson and freshman
Patty Purpur form what is undoubtedly the best
group of throwers in Stanford history and what,
according to Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wol-
Iman. could very well be "the best throwing
group in the country.'
Beginning today at 4 p.m., the trio will have a
chance to prove Wollman right and possibly
make a little history in the process. No school
has ever had three All-American women in the
weight events. If all goes right for the trio, Stan
ford will be the first.
"We could have three All-Americans, two in
the shot and one or more in the discus," Wol

lman said.
Purpur and Dukes will begin the qualifying
rounds of the shot put today with the finals to
follow on Friday. Going into the event, Dukes,
whose personal best of 56-feet-8 ranks her fifth
on the NCAA's all-time list, looks like the one
to beat. Her primary competition for the crown
will come from Rice's Regina Cavanaugh.
Tomorrow and Saturday Purpur and Dukes
will be joined by Nickerson in the discus, an
event which looks to be wide open. The favorite
would have to be San Diego State's Laura De-
Snoo, a 1984 Olympian who's dominated the
event this year.
But from there, things get harder to call.
Nickerson. Stanford's leading discus thrower,
will battle it out with Dukes and UCLA's Toni
Cutjens. According to Nickerson, the evept will
probably go to "whoever has a good day." If
any of the older throwers falter, Purpur, who
placed third in the discus at the Pac-West Con
ference Championships and seventh in the
NC A A indoor shot-put, should be there to take
up the slack.
Also competing for the Stanford women's
team will be senior Alison Wiley in the 3,000
and 5,000-meters, sophomore Lisa Bernhagen


Brian Marshall leaped onto the list of favorites for the NC A A
high jump title by clearing a school record height of 7-4 1/4 in

Kym Boy man/Daily file
the Pac-10 meet. Marshall will be joined by I Oof his male and
female Stanford teammates in Indianapolis.
