# Atkinson and Dukes lead track contingent
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
While the rest of the campus will have a few
more days to pack up and prepare for exams, 11
Stanford track and field athletes will begin their
final tests this afternoon in Indianapolis, Ind. at
the NCAA championships.
It's been an up-and-down year for Cardinal
track, but shining through it all have been some
consistent performers. They've come through
all season, and again they'll be the key for the
Cardinal in Indianapolis.
For the women's team, the key performers
will be the throwers. Together, seniors Pam
Dukes and Karen Nickerson and freshman
Patty Purpur form what is undoubtedly the best
group of throwers in Stanford history and what,
according to Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wol-
Iman. could very well be "the best throwing
group in the country.'
Beginning today at 4 p.m., the trio will have a
chance to prove Wollman right and possibly
make a little history in the process. No school
has ever had three All-American women in the
weight events. If all goes right for the trio, Stan
ford will be the first.
"We could have three All-Americans, two in
the shot and one or more in the discus," Wol

lman said.
Purpur and Dukes will begin the qualifying
rounds of the shot put today with the finals to
follow on Friday. Going into the event, Dukes,
whose personal best of 56-feet-8 ranks her fifth
on the NCAA's all-time list, looks like the one
to beat. Her primary competition for the crown
will come from Rice's Regina Cavanaugh.
Tomorrow and Saturday Purpur and Dukes
will be joined by Nickerson in the discus, an
event which looks to be wide open. The favorite
would have to be San Diego State's Laura De-
Snoo, a 1984 Olympian who's dominated the
event this year.
But from there, things get harder to call.
Nickerson. Stanford's leading discus thrower,
will battle it out with Dukes and UCLA's Toni
Cutjens. According to Nickerson, the evept will
probably go to "whoever has a good day." If
any of the older throwers falter, Purpur, who
placed third in the discus at the Pac-West Con
ference Championships and seventh in the
NC A A indoor shot-put, should be there to take
up the slack.
Also competing for the Stanford women's
team will be senior Alison Wiley in the 3,000
and 5,000-meters, sophomore Lisa Bernhagen


Brian Marshall leaped onto the list of favorites for the NC A A
high jump title by clearing a school record height of 7-4 1/4 in

the Pac-10 meet. Marshall will be joined by I Oof his male and
female Stanford teammates in Indianapolis.
in the high jump and senior Denise
Gatzambide in the heptathlon.
Wiley, who won the 1983 NCAA
3,000 in a record time of 9:03.5 1, has
recently overcome a string of injuries
and is beginning to make a comeback.
Two weeks ago at the the Pac-Wests,
she walked away with firsts in the
1,500 and 3,000. Her times this year
haven't been as fast as in the past, but
if the races become tactical, as they
often do at the nationals, Wiley's ex
perience could carry her to a high
finish.
Both Bernhagen and Gatzambide
are coming on at the right time. At
the Pac-West's Bernhagen finished
second with a school record jump of
6-I'/2. Gatzambide scored 5,33 1
points in the hepthathlon. just 6 1
short of her school record, to finish
first as well.
For the men's team, sophomore
high jumper Brian Marshall is in

about the same position â€” he's
peaking at the right time. Last year he
placed 11th at the NCAAs with a
leap of 7-1; this year he'd been in a
slump, barely able to clear seven feet.
But three weeks ago at the
Modesto Invitational, he pulled out
of his tailspin and leaped 7-3'/a. The
following week, hew on the Pacific 10
Conference title with a jump of 7-4
1/4, a Pac-10 and Stanford record.
Marshall is silting in a nice position
for the nationals. "1 feel good about
it. I knew I could jump that high (7-4
1/4). now 1 think 1 can go higher," he
said.
Also representing the men's team
in Indianapolis will be seniors Jeff
Atkinson and Jay Thorson and soph
omore Christian Skoog. Atkinson will
run the 1,500, Skoog will compete in
the 800 and Thorson will enter the
decathlon.
Atkinson, last year's seventh-place
finisher and the Stanford school
record holder in the 1,500, will be
one of the favorites to win. He

finished second to his rival from
Oregon, Dub Myers, at the Pac-lOs.
but at the NCA As he'd like to finish
higher.
"The challenge has been set. now it
has to be conquered, Atkinson said
last week after his loss to Myers.
Thorson, after a surprising fourth
place finish at the Pac-lOs, could be
"someone to look for at the
NCAAs," according to Wollman.
The event will belong to Washing
ton's Mike Ramos, who scored an
NCAA record 8.322 points at the
Pac-lOs, but if Thorson continues to
improve he could wind up in the top
10.
Rounding out the NCAA com
petitiors for the Cardinal is Skoog.
After recording a number of times
which fell just short of the NCAA
qualifying mark. Skoog traveled to
Oregon State Thursday, where he
capitalized on his last chance and
qualified in the 800. Skoog's prelimi
nary heat will be this evening with the
finals to follow on Friday if he ad
vances.
