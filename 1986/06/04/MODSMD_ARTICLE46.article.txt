# VanDerveer to coach East
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY Editorial staff 
After a phenomenally successful five-year stint at Ohio
State, Tara VanDerveer came to Stanford this year
looking to put the Cardinal on the women's basketball
map.
T his summer's Olympic Festival (formerly the National
Sports Festival) is proof that VanDerveer is well on her
way to realizing this goal. VanDerveer was chosen to
coach the East squad, and two of her players, sophomore
Kami Anderson and freshman Jill Yanke, were named to
the West team.
"It's a tremendous compliment," VanDerveer said of
being chosen for the Olympic Festival, noting that it is the
"first step toward an Olympic goal" for both coaches and
players.
For Anderson and Yanke, the competition in Houston,
Texas, will give them an opportunity to hone their skills
against some of the best playeiN in the country.
"That was my goal, to make the team," Anderson said.
"I was just so relieved because I wanted it so bad. I'm
going to enjoy it. I'm not going to be intimidated at all."
"I was very excited," Yanke said of being picked. "One
reason was that Kami got it too."
Yanke, however, has a case of patellar tendinitis that
may keep her on the sidelines. She plans to visit her doc
tor after finals in hopes of receiving clearance for the late-
July games.
"I'm pretty sure I'll be ready to play," the 6-foot-5 cen
ter said.
VanDerveer has not asked her top scorer to sit out in
order to stay fresh for next year's season if the doctor
clears Yanke for summer play.

" The Sportsfest only lasts two weeks," the Stanford
mentor said. "School doesn't start until October. She'll be
able to rest enough."
Yanke and Anderson played key roles on a St nford
team that flirted with the .500 mark all year before falling
to 13-15. Anderson, a 6-0 forward from Valley City,
N. D., assumed a sixth man role after coming back from an
early-season stress fracture but still managed to net 11.9
points a game.
Yanke, a Boise, Idaho product, tossed in 13 points per
contest and led the Cardinal in field goals and field goals
attempted.
It's on the defensive end of the court, though, that Van-
Derveer feels her young stars will gain valuable experi
ence.
"You have to play man-to-man, which is good," she
said.
Although only Yanke and Anderson made the team,
several othercurrent and future Stanford players attended
the tryouts.
"1 was really pleased with the number of people that
tried out." VanDerveer said. "Even the tryouts are real
good experiences for the kids."
Stanford participants in the trials included recruit Jen
nifer Azzi, sophomore Charli Turner and freshmen
Andrea Ransom and Emily Wagner..
The two members of the Cardinal who made the West
team share a common goal for the Festival.
"The West has never done that well, (but) I keep telling
Tara we're going to beat the East (VanDerveer's) team."
Yanke said.
When asked about the prospects of riding the bench
next year if she and Yanke knock their coach's team out
of the tournament, Anderson replied "I think for sure
we'll be playing then."
