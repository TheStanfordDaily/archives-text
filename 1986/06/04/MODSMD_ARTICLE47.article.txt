"A Vietcong Memoir"
By Truong Nhu I ang
Vintage Books, $8.95
"A Vietcong Memoir" is well worth reading, particu
larly in the light of the topicality of "people's revolutions"
and "wars ot national liberation " Written by the highest
ranking Vietnamese defector, it is highly recommendable,
with a few caveats.
Two other authors' names appear with Truong Nhu
Tang's — David Chanoff and Doan Toai. 1 was expecting
a laborious script with the ghostly presences of other writ
ers, but the book is quite stylish. References to his father
as a "Vietnamese paterfamilias" who did not know that
his son's collegiate dabbling in revolution was turning him
into a sort of "political sorcerer's apprentice" make the
text readable, enjoyable and fast-going.
Tang dedicates the book to "my mother and father and
to my betrayed comrades who believed they were sacrific
ing themselves for a humane liberation of their people."
These are the book's major themes — the interweaving of
family and nationalism in Vietnam and the story of a
betrayed revolution.
As a college student. Tang meets Ho Chi Minh, who
plays the heartstrings of his family ties like a master
violinist. Ho reminds him of his grandfather, who used to
impart Confucian wisdom in little family gatherings. Ho
notices that Tang's name means a jewel in Chinese char
acters and together they discover that Tang's father
named all his sons after jewels. Ho's tenderness for the
South and his desire for its liberation touch Tang. Tang
never lost this first misty-eyed impression of Ho; when
later confronted with the ironclad communist ideology of
the North Vietnamese, he throws quotes from Ho at
them; "Nothing is more precious than independence and
liberty."
When the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam
adopted a manifesto, Tang was struck by its political so
phistication: "I suspected I was seeing . . . the delicate fin
gerprints of Ho Chi Minh." Yet it seemed natural at the

time to share in the expertise of the North. Tang
swallowed whole North Vietnam's proclamations that
"No one has this stupid and criminal idea of annexing the
South." South Vietnam was special, unique; the North's
sole interest in it was to help liberate it from the common
oppressor.
Tang tells us that, "the nationalist and anti-American
sentiments that colored everything we said were common
among many Southerners." The NLF built a coalition of
people of diverse interests and backgrounds. The NLF
manipulated the American press, organized from "Peace"
groups and played upon South Vietnamese national senti
ments. Tang assures us that "Had Ngo Kinh Diem proved
a man of breadth and vision, the core of people who filled
the NLF and its sister organizations would have rallied to
him." Tang emphasizes that Diem's and later Thieu's cor
ruption and callousness hastened their downfalls as much
as any military and/or political weapons.
Tang claims he was first, last and always a nationalist.
The NLF promised a democratic coalition government,
free elections, freedom of expression, press, belief, assem
bly, movement and non-alignment. None of these prom
ises, of course, were delivered; in fact, they were brutally,
painfully abrogated to the point that Tang, along with
several million of his countrymen, wound up in the South
China Sea, wishing that the once-hated Americans would
pick him up and rescue him.

The harmonious relationship between North Vietnam
and the NLF showed signs of strain as victory approached.
Hanoi's hardliners questioned the revolutionary creden
tials of people like Tang. It soon became apparent that all
the talk about a self-governed South was just talk and that
annexation of the South would take place brutally and
rapidly.
After Vietnam's victory over "American imperialism,"
Tang found himself disgusted and frightened by the
brusque presumption of power by the North Vietnamese.
They barely concealed their contempt for the NLF's
aspirations. It was "almost as if they believed they were
the conquerors and we the vanquished ... the program
now was to strip away as fast as possible the apparent
respect for pluralistic government, neutrality, national
concord. ... we finally knew that we had been well and
truly sold."
Tang watched his brothers and comrades who were not
ideologically "pure" as they were taken to re-education
camps and incarcerated for years. Finally, he tied his
native land.
From 1975-83, at least 65,000 Vietnamese were ex
ecuted for political reasons in Vietnam. Hundreds of
thousands of Vietnamese were put through the torture of
re-education camps; presently, there are from 40,000 to
over 100,000 still imprisoned in those camps.
"Nothing," wrote Ho Chi Minh, "is more precious than
independence and liberty." That beautiful sentiment sits

like a mocking epitaph over the corpse of Vietnam now
that the "war of national liberation" is complete.
The caveats for the book come from Doug Pike,
renowned Hanoi-watcher, who spent lOyears in Vietnam
as a career foreign service officer and who is now director
of the Indochina Studies Program at UC-Berkeley. He
gave "A Vietcong Memoir" a harsh review in the "New
Republic."
Tang, he says, made himself out to be more than he
was. He probably came to the revolution much later than
he lets on. Of North Vietnam's intentions for the NLF and
South Vietnam, Tang is either being disingenuous or is a
case of "extraordinary credulity." Pike calls Tang an op
portunist, someone who, like many others, spent most of
the war sitting on the fence, conspiring in secret societies,
and in general practicing what the Vietnamese call "di
hang hai," which means to go down two roads simultane
ously. He feels that Tang tells us nothing new about the
NLF or the connections that existed with the American
anti-war movement. Pike, who has a libraryful of
shrapnel-torn interviews with Vietcong, should know.
Tang, of all the important NLF leaders, is the least known
and did not show up in information reports until late in
the war.
However, I believe there are honest pangs of regret for
the "selling" of what he and so many others hoped was a
movement for national self-determination. It is a cry for
Americans to understand the aspirations of small nations
for freedom — goals we are in a tremendous historical po
sition to aid.
On a witness committee before Congress, Tang begged
the United States to reinvade Vietnam and rescue his
country. Pike, also on the committee, wondered if the ut
ter irony of this was lost on Tang. Perhaps not. One
wonders what Tang felt as he begged his former enemy to
come rescue his country from the regime he helped place
in power. Of the oft-invoked "lessons of Vietnam" this is
one of the least spoken of — that dominion of the
" American imperialists" wound up being far preferable to
the oppression of the "liberators." No wonder Pike saw
such black irony in Tangs's proposition that America
come help Vietnam reinvent the wheel.
