The Portable Stanford
$9.95, softbound
Can one gently draw back the Iron
Curtain so that Westerners can see
inside without oversimplifying Soviet
issues? "The Gorbachev Era," a Por
table Stanford book edited by History
Prof. Alexander Dallin and Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice,
succeeds fairly handily at providing a
range of articles about various aspects
of the Soviet Union without directing
itself toward either specialists or kin
dergarteners.
Dallin and Rice each provide two
of the 13 articles in the collection,
and their writings are nicely con
trapuntal: Dallin writes on the ques
tion of how the Soviet and Russian
past affects the Soviet Union today,
dispelling misconceptions and dis
pensing practical insights as he goes
along. His second article, placed ap
propriately at the end of the book,
dissolves the myth of the supposed
Soviet quest for expansion and
outlines the gradual dissipation in the
Soviet period of any such plans left
over from revolutionary times.
Rice, on the other hand, writes in a
quite specific and technical manner,
displaying her expertise on the sub
ject of the Soviet military and contri
buting possibly the best article in the
collection, a historically based ex
planation of the Soviet 1 alliance sys
tem in Eastern Europe and the way it
differs substantially from more pe
ripheral Soviet "satellites."
In general, "The Gorbachev Era*
is something of a misnomer, since
Gorbachev has little to do with the
book's general project of attempting
to provide a layperson with some in
sight into such topics as dissidence in

the Soviet Union, the question of
nationalities, the special condition of
the writer, the economy, the place of
science in Soviet society and the issue
of arms control.
One can write from a mid-'Bos
perspective on the Soviet Union, but
it is still a bit early to practically
assess the way Gorbachev's "era" will
change the Soviet Union. One can,
and the writers included in the collec
tion do, write about the problems
facing Soviet leaders today: the
necessity to increase productivity in
the face of full employment, the need
to come to terms with the high cost of
providing arms to both the Soviet
Union and those countries it supplies;
the ever-present problems of inef
ficiency and alcoholism.
Failing time to read Hedrick
Smith's "The Russians," still the most

practical and encyclopaedic descrip
tion of contemporary Soviet life,
though admittedly by now slightly out
of date, "The Gorbachev Era" is not
a bad educational tool, and its more
technical articles are good for getting
a bare-bones introduction to the is
sues of Soviet influence and military
power. What Smith captures so use
fully for a Westerner, the sense of
everyday life in Russia, is what is mis
sing in this collection. That need not
be a drawback, however, if "The
Gorbachev Era," is read in conjunc
tion with pieces such as Smith's.
The book is beautifully laid out in
the El Lissitzky constructivist style,
with numerous reproductions of
'20s posters, and the articles are
short and mostly sweet: in brief, a
beautiful package with respectable
contents.
