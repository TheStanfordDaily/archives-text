Stanford's shareholdings in com
panies that do business in South
Africa will be drastically reduced
within a sear. I niversity President
Donald Kennedy said in an intervieN*
Monday
KcnnedN said he feels that U.S.
companies today are headed in the
right dnection out of South Africa.
I he initiatives ot those companies,
coupled nn itli continued I niversity di
vestment. will account tor the reduc
tion, he said.
Kennedy offers a "wild guess"
prediction that m one year. Stanford's
SIS 2 million invested in companies
with interests in South Africa n\ill
have dropped to about $S0 million.
The president countered student

accusations that he has been closed
minded on the divestment issue and
that he lias stilled open discussion. In
addition, he said he does not agree
with students who charge that contin
ued dialogue with the administration
on divestment is a dead-end street.
He called the charge a "premature
conclusion."
"The purpose of rational dialogue
is not |iist to produce the outcome
vou desire. " lie said. "More otten.
dialogue is an instrument of negotia
tion ... to modify positions."
The recent student charges came in
the wake of the University's divest
ment of S l *. 1 "'!' in Newmont Mining
holdings. I'he student protest group
Stanford Out of South Africa, which
has arcned for a blanket divestment.
