# Kennedy: shares may be reduced
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Stanford's shareholdings in com
panies that do business in South
Africa will be drastically reduced
within a sear. I niversity President
Donald Kennedy said in an intervieN*
Monday
KcnnedN said he feels that U.S.
companies today are headed in the
right dnection out of South Africa.
I he initiatives ot those companies,
coupled nn itli continued I niversity di
vestment. will account tor the reduc
tion, he said.
Kennedy offers a "wild guess"
prediction that m one year. Stanford's
SIS 2 million invested in companies
with interests in South Africa n\ill
have dropped to about $S0 million.
The president countered student

accusations that he has been closed
minded on the divestment issue and
that he lias stilled open discussion. In
addition, he said he does not agree
with students who charge that contin
ued dialogue with the administration
on divestment is a dead-end street.
He called the charge a "premature
conclusion."
"The purpose of rational dialogue
is not |iist to produce the outcome
vou desire. " lie said. "More otten.
dialogue is an instrument of negotia
tion ... to modify positions."
The recent student charges came in
the wake of the University's divest
ment of S l *. 1 "'!' in Newmont Mining
holdings. I'he student protest group
Stanford Out of South Africa, which
has arcned for a blanket divestment.

called the move a "token gesture"
and an "insult" to members of the
community.
But Kennedy has argued that the
Newmont decision — the University's
first act of divestment — was not an
insult, and he said Monday that "it's
quite likely that we [will] have done a

few more divestments" a year from
now.
Some student protesters argue that
Kennedy has made divestment a non
negotiable issue, charging that he is
unwilling to recognize the symbolic
merits of blanket divestment. Critics
of the administration have used the
divestment issue to show that Ken
nedy is closed-minded, a portrayal he
does not accept lying down.
"It bothers me," he said, asserting
that he is more accountable to his

community than are other university
presidents.
"I honestly think this University
has more chances to put its views
before me than is normally true in
places like this."
"Any student who calls here with a
proposal has been able to [meet with
me]," he said. "We agreed to the
(May) forum [even though! we knew
the design was not to our advantage.''"
Kennedy notes that he has spent
much time on the divestment issue,
discussing the issues involved, ex
plaining the investment decisions of
the Board of Trustees, lobbying for
strong U.S. economic sanctions
against the South Africa regime, and
meeting with corporation and foun
dation executives to discuss their
policies. In August he plans to spend
a week in South Africa.
Though he admits that he cannot
be convinced at this time that blanket
divestment is the wisest option for
fighting apartheid, he leaves open the
possibility that his views, and the
board's current policy of selective di
vestment, are subject to change over
time.
He maintains that the University
should continue an "aggressively
pursued selective divestment policy,"
evaluating companies on an individ
ual basis. The University should
divest of its holdings in companies
only after attempting a "serious effort
to change corporate policy," he
argues.
Kennedy and the Board of Trus
tees have shown a willingness to listen
to divestment arguments that chal
lenge their own opinions.
This spring, Kennedy has discussed
divestment issues with protesters on
his front lawn, fielded questions in a
conference after the trustees' final

meeting, and appeared at an open
forum.
The Noard, meeting last month at
Kennedy's house, invited three stu
dents to present their views on divest
ment to a trustee committee on in
vestment responsibility. Then, in an
unprecedented move, Board Presi
dent Warren Christopher allowed
senior Paula Groves to attend a full
board meeting the following day.
Groves, student representative to
the board's Special Committee on In
vestments, said she had agreed to
comply with a trustee policy of not
discussing the meeting in any detail,
but she noted that when the board
asked for her opinion, she laid out an
argument for total divestment that
was well-received.
In the Monday interview, Kennedy
said he thought that student presenta
tions and discussions have had a
greater effect on the trustees' views
than have protests.
Kennedy emphasized the adminis
tration's willingness to listen and
negotiate, and warned against "chic"
protesting. He referred specifically to
students' calls for the University to
drop legal charges against them after
acts of civil disobedience.
"Civil disobedience is often an ef
fective kind of symbolism because
people are understandably impressed
by the willingness of others to make
personal sacrifices for their beliefs.
To the extent that a symbolic protest
is free of consequence, it doesn't have
that message," Kennedy said.

But Kennedy has argued that the
Newmont decision — the University's
first act of divestment — was not an
insult, and he said Monday that "it's
quite likely that we [will] have done a

few more divestments" a year from
now.
Some student protesters argue that
Kennedy has made divestment a non
negotiable issue, charging that he is
unwilling to recognize the symbolic
merits of blanket divestment. Critics
of the administration have used the
divestment issue to show that Ken
nedy is closed-minded, a portrayal he
does not accept lying down.
"It bothers me," he said, asserting
that he is more accountable to his

community than are other university
presidents.
"I honestly think this University
has more chances to put its views
before me than is normally true in
places like this."
"Any student who calls here with a
proposal has been able to [meet with
me]," he said. "We agreed to the
(May) forum [even though! we knew
the design was not to our advantage.''"
Kennedy notes that he has spent
much time on the divestment issue,
discussing the issues involved, ex
plaining the investment decisions of
the Board of Trustees, lobbying for
strong U.S. economic sanctions
against the South Africa regime, and
meeting with corporation and foun
dation executives to discuss their
policies. In August he plans to spend
a week in South Africa.
Though he admits that he cannot
be convinced at this time that blanket
divestment is the wisest option for
fighting apartheid, he leaves open the
possibility that his views, and the
board's current policy of selective di
vestment, are subject to change over
time.
He maintains that the University
should continue an "aggressively
pursued selective divestment policy,"
evaluating companies on an individ
ual basis. The University should
divest of its holdings in companies
only after attempting a "serious effort
to change corporate policy," he
argues.
Kennedy and the Board of Trus
tees have shown a willingness to listen
to divestment arguments that chal
lenge their own opinions.
This spring, Kennedy has discussed
divestment issues with protesters on
his front lawn, fielded questions in a
conference after the trustees' final

meeting, and appeared at an open
forum.
The Noard, meeting last month at
Kennedy's house, invited three stu
dents to present their views on divest
ment to a trustee committee on in
vestment responsibility. Then, in an
unprecedented move, Board Presi
dent Warren Christopher allowed
senior Paula Groves to attend a full
board meeting the following day.
Groves, student representative to
the board's Special Committee on In
vestments, said she had agreed to
comply with a trustee policy of not
discussing the meeting in any detail,
but she noted that when the board
asked for her opinion, she laid out an
argument for total divestment that
was well-received.
In the Monday interview, Kennedy
said he thought that student presenta
tions and discussions have had a
greater effect on the trustees' views
than have protests.
Kennedy emphasized the adminis
tration's willingness to listen and
negotiate, and warned against "chic"
protesting. He referred specifically to
students' calls for the University to
drop legal charges against them after
acts of civil disobedience.
"Civil disobedience is often an ef
fective kind of symbolism because
people are understandably impressed
by the willingness of others to make
personal sacrifices for their beliefs.
To the extent that a symbolic protest
is free of consequence, it doesn't have
that message," Kennedy said.
Stanford's shareholdings in com
panies that do business in South
Africa will be drastically reduced
within a sear. I niversity President
Donald Kennedy said in an intervieN*
Monday
KcnnedN said he feels that U.S.
companies today are headed in the
right dnection out of South Africa.
I he initiatives ot those companies,
coupled nn itli continued I niversity di
vestment. will account tor the reduc
tion, he said.
Kennedy offers a "wild guess"
prediction that m one year. Stanford's
SIS 2 million invested in companies
with interests in South Africa n\ill
have dropped to about $S0 million.
The president countered student

accusations that he has been closed
minded on the divestment issue and
that he lias stilled open discussion. In
addition, he said he does not agree
with students who charge that contin
ued dialogue with the administration
on divestment is a dead-end street.
He called the charge a "premature
conclusion."
"The purpose of rational dialogue
is not |iist to produce the outcome
vou desire. " lie said. "More otten.
dialogue is an instrument of negotia
tion ... to modify positions."
The recent student charges came in
the wake of the University's divest
ment of S l *. 1 "'!' in Newmont Mining
holdings. I'he student protest group

has arcned for a blanket divestment.
