"Against All Hope"
By Armando Valladares
Alfred A. Knopf, $18.95
Arrested for privately expressing his political convic
tions and then subjected to Cuban revolutionary
"justice" for 20 years, Armado Valladares tells his
story in his new book, "Against All Hope."' The book
is more than a testament to a personal will to survive
on one s own terms in the face of institutionalized
oppression. It attempts to enlighten those who are will
ing to tolerate present human rights abuses as a means
to a humane communist end. It also protests the silence
of international organizations such as the United Na
tions and the Red Cross in the face of mounting
evidence of the iniquity of Cuban prisons.
For the most part, though, the reader's anger and
frustration over Castro's treatment of political
prisoners needn't be fanned by commentary on global
indifference to the situation. The events speak for
themselves. At the first prison in which Valladares is
interred, scores of men who had fought under Batista
or had in some way opposed Castro are summarily ex
ecuted. According to the author, many of those shot or
serving long prison sentences did nothing more than
make a personal criticism of Castro, among them men
who had fought by Castro's side throughout the revo
lution. Trials are farcical, with verdicts predetermined
in every case. Guards have carte blanche to beat
prisoners brutally, even to death.
At times, the punishment inflicted is so cruel and ar
bitrary as to seem surreal. Prisoners are forced into a
lake of raw sewage and nearly drowned. "Drawer
cells," five-feet-by-two-feet, hold prisoners for up to six
months, psychologically ruining their inmates. In one
prison, doctors and direct such tortures
as inducing certain diseases through dietary
deficiencies and then withholding medical treatment in
order to monitor the progression of the illness. They
also oversee punitive castration.
Woven through the litany of horrors and pain is a
motif of love and hope. A white-haired clergyman who
was transferred with Valladares from prison to prison
never tires of exhorting his fellow inmates to have pa
tience and not repay hate with hate. Even during the

daily beatings he would cry, "Forgive them Lord for
they know not what they do." Eventually he is gunned
down as he says this, and his martyrdom inspires the
others with a new hope, that he did not die in vain.
Another spur to hope and love is Valladares future
wife, whom he meets as she visits her father in prison.
She publicizes news of the prison conditions so widely
that it was Francois Mitterand who personally in
terceded in 1982.
To her he also smuggles his poetry, which at times he
must write with his blood for lack of writing utensils
and onto onion skins for lack of paper. It earns him the
recognition of such intellectual luminaries as Sartre,
lonesco and Mario Vargas Llosa.
Some of the most telling indictments of socialism, as
practised in Cuba, come not from physical brutality but
from the expression of certain ideas and bureaucratic
actions. A jailer extols Castro to Valladares, explaining
that the material well-being of the population has risen
considerably since Castro's assumption of power; Val
ladares is unsuccessful in convincing the man that ma
terial gratification means nothing if coupled with a
ruthless suppression of intellectual self-determination.
Another time, a government order abolishes the yel
low uniform of the political prisoner, decreeing that all
prisoners will henceforth wear the blue uniform of the
common criminal. In its zeal to eradicate class differ
ences, the revolution fails or refuses to distinguish be
tween men jailed for preaching Christianity too insis
tently and those jailed for murder, between those
jailed for believing in freedom of speech and those
jailed for rape.
Valladares says he wrote his poetry in prison chiefly
so that a record of the injustices done in Cuban prisons
would survive in case he didn't. Having survived, he
now has the chance to enlarge that record for the sake
of the thousands still in those prisons. Through his
book, the plot of which, he says, was furnished by the
government ("All I did was write it down,") Val
ladares hopes to galvanize critical world opinion for
exerting pressure on Castro.
Sometimes in the midst of statistics and ideological
jargon, the urgency of the goals of our foreign policy
with respect to human rights is obscured. Valladares'
book compellingly reawakens one's slumbering con
cern for the preservation of those rights abroad which
we too easily take for granted here.

bitrary as to seem surreal. Prisoners are forced into a
lake of raw sewage and nearly drowned. "Drawer
cells," five-feet-by-two-feet, hold prisoners for up to six
months, psychologically ruining their inmates. In one
prison, doctors and direct such tortures
as inducing certain diseases through dietary
deficiencies and then withholding medical treatment in
order to monitor the progression of the illness. They
also oversee punitive castration.
Woven through the litany of horrors and pain is a
motif of love and hope. A white-haired clergyman who
was transferred with Valladares from prison to prison
never tires of exhorting his fellow inmates to have pa
tience and not repay hate with hate. Even during the

daily beatings he would cry, "Forgive them Lord for
they know not what they do." Eventually he is gunned
down as he says this, and his martyrdom inspires the
others with a new hope, that he did not die in vain.
Another spur to hope and love is Valladares future
wife, whom he meets as she visits her father in prison.
She publicizes news of the prison conditions so widely
that it was Francois Mitterand who personally in
terceded in 1982.
To her he also smuggles his poetry, which at times he
must write with his blood for lack of writing utensils
and onto onion skins for lack of paper. It earns him the
recognition of such intellectual luminaries as Sartre,
lonesco and Mario Vargas Llosa.
Some of the most telling indictments of socialism, as
practised in Cuba, come not from physical brutality but
from the expression of certain ideas and bureaucratic
actions. A jailer extols Castro to Valladares, explaining
that the material well-being of the population has risen
considerably since Castro's assumption of power; Val
ladares is unsuccessful in convincing the man that ma
terial gratification means nothing if coupled with a
ruthless suppression of intellectual self-determination.
Another time, a government order abolishes the yel
low uniform of the political prisoner, decreeing that all
prisoners will henceforth wear the blue uniform of the
common criminal. In its zeal to eradicate class differ
ences, the revolution fails or refuses to distinguish be
tween men jailed for preaching Christianity too insis
tently and those jailed for murder, between those
jailed for believing in freedom of speech and those
jailed for rape.
Valladares says he wrote his poetry in prison chiefly
so that a record of the injustices done in Cuban prisons
would survive in case he didn't. Having survived, he
now has the chance to enlarge that record for the sake
of the thousands still in those prisons. Through his
book, the plot of which, he says, was furnished by the
government ("All I did was write it down,") Val
ladares hopes to galvanize critical world opinion for
exerting pressure on Castro.
Sometimes in the midst of statistics and ideological
jargon, the urgency of the goals of our foreign policy
with respect to human rights is obscured. Valladares'
book compellingly reawakens one's slumbering con
cern for the preservation of those rights abroad which
we too easily take for granted here.
