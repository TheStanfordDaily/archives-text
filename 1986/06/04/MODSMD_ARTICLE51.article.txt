# Miller's 'The Good Mother' is not so great

"The Good Mother"
By Sue Miller
Harper and Row
$17.95
The reviews on this one were
clearly unclear — The New York
Times nearly frothed at the mouth on
the front page of its book review sup
plement, calling Sue Miller a writer
who, with her very first novel, had
managed to rocket into the literary
stratosphere, far beyond the level
more experienced writers (Judith
Krantz? John Le Carre?) could even
fantasize about attaining.
Shortly after that breathless bit of
praise, The Los Angeles Times came
out with an unenthusiastic appraisal
— Miller had certain gifts, the
reviewer sniffed, but the fact that this
was, after all, only her first novel
shone through blindingly. Her prose,
the reviewer said, suffered from
preachiness, sentimentality — in
short, everything a first novel should
avoid like the plague. "The Good
Mother" was for the most part some
thing of a dandelion — attractive,
fluffy, even enticing, but ultimately so
much seed in the wind.
Actually, the divergence of opinion
here probably says more about the
flaws of book review journalism
(given its penchant for deceit and
patronage) than about Miller's
novel. But that's another issue al
together. Ultimately, "The Good
Mother" is neither so scintillating nor
so abysmal that you won't find any
thing to agree with in either review
(or this one). Sorry, folks. A master
piece this ain't.
"The Good Mother" has a lot
going for it. Miller, an accomplished
short-storv writer and sometime col
lege professor, clearly knows her stuff

when it comes to prose style. (She's
read Strunk and White like any con
scientious writer "should.") Rarely
are words wasted in this novel; when
Miller does err, it's generally on the
side of minimalism — and that's for
the good, as any of her colleagues
would tell you in a minute. Miller also
has a startlingly apt eye for physical
detail that yanks you into the setting
of the story (almost dislocating your
shoulder in the process) instead of
leaving you on the sidelines like some
vaguely unwelcome bystander. Her
attention to the effect of exposed
human skin on the beholder,
repeated throughout the novel, is
particularly revealing.
Miller's main character in this out
ing, Anna Dunlap, is the only child of
a puritanical Eastern couple; they are
so puritanical, in fact, that Anna re
members weekends with her mother's
relatives far more vividly than week
days with her parents themselves.
(Her parents aren't necessarily
boring; they're just sort of stodgy,
that's all.)
But don't let the word
"puritanical" throw you. Anna gets
raised so well it makes any real par
ents look like depraved child-abusers
by comparison. That's the trouble, it
turns out; Anna is raised too well. It's
bound to show up later — after all,
Anna will come of age in the '80s,
when psychological introspection and
troubleshooting are all the rage.
Anyway, that's just the background
stuff. The upshot is that Anna gets
married to a puritanical hubby
(whom she'd have avoided like the
plague had she had the chance to read
"Smart Women, Foolish Choices").
They have a daughter —
miraculously, it turns out, given
Anna's predilection to lapse into exis
tential dread in the middle of the act.
And, in the daughter's fourth year or
thereabouts, the Dunlaps separate

and then divorce.
The novel's point of departure is
this daughter, Molly by name. Now,
Molly is nothing special — ostensibly,
she's just another child of the '80s,
whining, precocious, stubborn and
spoiled as can be. (She's the Punky
Brewster of belles lettres.)

Ah, but Miller has plans for this
tyke. She clearly intends Molly's
presence as something of a symbol —
say, for the sanctity of childrearing,
the purity and unassailability of the
baby stroller, or what have you. So
even though Molly is little more than
a cipher herself (after all, how much
character development can you get
out of a four-year-old, right?), her
aura looms large and portentous
throughout the novel. She is, after all,
Anna's reason for living, the reason
she lets all the other relationships in
her life (parents, pals, hubby, even —
God forbid — lover) go to hell in a
handbasket.
The bare essentials of the rest of
the plot (without giving away the
double-twist ending) are as follows;
After the divorce, Anna meets a
leonine man (hence his name, Leo)

whom she subsequently shacks up
with. Molly falls in cherubic love with
him, which pleases Anna to no end;
she wants so much for Molly kins to
be happy and well-adjusted. But if
Anna can be happy in the bargain —
well, that's just too much to ask for,
almost.

Sue Miller really
shows her stuff
when it comes to
prose style.

Or more than almost. Ex-hubby
takes Molly away for the weekend
soon thereafter and learns in the
course of idle conversation with his
daughter that Leo, at the child's be
hest, briefly displayed his genitals to
her after a shower one morning. It
also comes out that Anna let the child
climb into bed with her, to be com
forted after a nightmare — right in
the middle of some jollies with Leo.
So all this sexual permissiveness adds
up to a no-no; Anna's ex-hubby turns
red with Protestant disgust and files a
custody suit the next day.
This happens in the middle of the
novel; the remainder takes a too
leisurely jaunt through all the pre
trial, during-trial and post-trial
proceedings, giving us every single
syllable of court dialogue (even the
cops at the door get to put in their

two cents) and dissecting the tiniest
reaction Anna has.
That's about it as far as plot goes —
and it's symptomatic of a broader
problem with "The Good Mother" as
a whole.
Miller has written, in essence, a
classic yuppie drama — in the literary
fallout to come in the next decade or
so, observers will probably rank this
effort among the top 10 to 15 novels
typifying the upwardly mobile
Weltanschauung. There's the stand
ards; introspective bitching and
moaning; psychological angst; weari
ness, anxiety and dread; and the eter
nal bugaboo, to be avoided at almost
any cost — maladjustment.
Of more importance to the literary
character of the novel, however, is
Miller's failure to adhere to the old
English 001 saw "Show, don't tell."
(She, of all people, should know bet
ter.) To those readers with cynical at
titudes toward literature, "The Good
Mother" might seem little more than
a 310-page string of self-indulgent
(and frequently self-pitying) mental
posturings. Miller gives the novel to
Anna Dunlap, writing her novel en
tirely in the first person; and because
this is her first effort, she might not
have been as vigilant to trim herchar
acter's excesses as she might have.
Her editors should have caught this,
though. For them, there truly is no
excuse.
So we get a lot of analysis: why
Anna felt this way at this moment in
time — and, oh, lest you think her
possibly neurotic (Lord forbid!), the
rationale in her past to explain her
behavior away\ Miller seems to
assume that all this psychobabble can
take the place, somehow, of character
development. That just isn't the case.
And (getting back to Molly
dearest) neither is that the case with
ideology. Molly is used as a quoit in a
game of ideological horseshoes

throughout the novel, as a symbol for
a set of virtues larger than any one of
the characters themselves. Like
Joseph's brothers at the sight of his
multi-colored coat, every other char
acter Anna meets suddenly wants a
stake in things when they hear about
Molly.
It's as if by voicing some opinion
about her or by helping Anna toward
her righteous goal of regaining cus
tody, they are somehow making their
miserable yuppie existences more
plausible in the eyes of God. And —
once again, folks, you're ahead of me
by a mile — all this ideological prat
tling is at the cost of characterization.
It may very well be that Miller
assumes the reader will infer what
she's getting at: "Molly's special be
cause any mother/daughter relation
ship inherently transcends the limita
tions of the people themselves." But
she should let us find that out for our
selves through the characters. In this
case, they are so inadequately drawn
that (given Miller's desire to have
each character rally around the
transcendent parent-child relation
ship) we can't believe that any mom
and kid are that transcendent.
One reviewer compared "The
Good Mother" to other novels with
classic heroines (such as Elizabeth
Bennett and Anna Karenina). That
seems to be stretching things quite a
bit. The writer in question must have
been casting about, in her dazzlement
with the novel, for some epic
generalization to tie this effort to the
entire tradition of Western literature,
which Miller clearly echoes, but fails
to expand.
Not that she'll care. After all, when
you've got a novel rising in the Top
10 of the New York Times bestsel
ler list and a dizzyingly receptive
review from the same make-or-break
paper to boot, it's hard to care about
literary tradition.

a puritanical Eastern couple; they are
so puritanical, in fact, that Anna re
members weekends with her mother's
relatives far more vividly than week
days with her parents themselves.
(Her parents aren't necessarily
boring; they're just sort of stodgy,
that's all.)
But don't let the word
"puritanical" throw you. Anna gets
raised so well it makes any real par
ents look like depraved child-abusers
by comparison. That's the trouble, it
turns out; Anna is raised too well. It's
bound to show up later — after all,
Anna will come of age in the '80s,
when psychological introspection and
troubleshooting are all the rage.
Anyway, that's just the background
stuff. The upshot is that Anna gets
married to a puritanical hubby
(whom she'd have avoided like the
plague had she had the chance to read
"Smart Women, Foolish Choices").
They have a daughter —
miraculously, it turns out, given
Anna's predilection to lapse into exis
tential dread in the middle of the act.
And, in the daughter's fourth year or
thereabouts, the Dunlaps separate

and then divorce.
The novel's point of departure is
this daughter, Molly by name. Now,
Molly is nothing special — ostensibly,
she's just another child of the '80s,
whining, precocious, stubborn and
spoiled as can be. (She's the Punky
Brewster of belles lettres.)

Ah, but Miller has plans for this
tyke. She clearly intends Molly's
presence as something of a symbol —
say, for the sanctity of childrearing,
the purity and unassailability of the
baby stroller, or what have you. So
even though Molly is little more than
a cipher herself (after all, how much
character development can you get
out of a four-year-old, right?), her
aura looms large and portentous
throughout the novel. She is, after all,
Anna's reason for living, the reason
she lets all the other relationships in
her life (parents, pals, hubby, even —
God forbid — lover) go to hell in a
handbasket.
The bare essentials of the rest of
the plot (without giving away the
double-twist ending) are as follows;
After the divorce, Anna meets a
leonine man (hence his name, Leo)

whom she subsequently shacks up
with. Molly falls in cherubic love with
him, which pleases Anna to no end;
she wants so much for Molly kins to
be happy and well-adjusted. But if
Anna can be happy in the bargain —
well, that's just too much to ask for,
almost.

Sue Miller really
shows her stuff
when it comes to
prose style.

Or more than almost. Ex-hubby
takes Molly away for the weekend
soon thereafter and learns in the
course of idle conversation with his
daughter that Leo, at the child's be
hest, briefly displayed his genitals to
her after a shower one morning. It
also comes out that Anna let the child
climb into bed with her, to be com
forted after a nightmare — right in
the middle of some jollies with Leo.
So all this sexual permissiveness adds
up to a no-no; Anna's ex-hubby turns
red with Protestant disgust and files a
custody suit the next day.
This happens in the middle of the
novel; the remainder takes a too
leisurely jaunt through all the pre
trial, during-trial and post-trial
proceedings, giving us every single
syllable of court dialogue (even the
cops at the door get to put in their

two cents) and dissecting the tiniest
reaction Anna has.
That's about it as far as plot goes —
and it's symptomatic of a broader
problem with "The Good Mother" as
a whole.
Miller has written, in essence, a
classic yuppie drama — in the literary
fallout to come in the next decade or
so, observers will probably rank this
effort among the top 10 to 15 novels
typifying the upwardly mobile
Weltanschauung. There's the stand
ards; introspective bitching and
moaning; psychological angst; weari
ness, anxiety and dread; and the eter
nal bugaboo, to be avoided at almost
any cost — maladjustment.
Of more importance to the literary
character of the novel, however, is
Miller's failure to adhere to the old
English 001 saw "Show, don't tell."
(She, of all people, should know bet
ter.) To those readers with cynical at
titudes toward literature, "The Good
Mother" might seem little more than
a 310-page string of self-indulgent
(and frequently self-pitying) mental
posturings. Miller gives the novel to
Anna Dunlap, writing her novel en
tirely in the first person; and because
this is her first effort, she might not
have been as vigilant to trim herchar
acter's excesses as she might have.
Her editors should have caught this,
though. For them, there truly is no
excuse.
So we get a lot of analysis: why
Anna felt this way at this moment in
time — and, oh, lest you think her
possibly neurotic (Lord forbid!), the
rationale in her past to explain her
behavior away\ Miller seems to
assume that all this psychobabble can
take the place, somehow, of character
development. That just isn't the case.
And (getting back to Molly
dearest) neither is that the case with
ideology. Molly is used as a quoit in a
game of ideological horseshoes

throughout the novel, as a symbol for
a set of virtues larger than any one of
the characters themselves. Like
Joseph's brothers at the sight of his
multi-colored coat, every other char
acter Anna meets suddenly wants a
stake in things when they hear about
Molly.
It's as if by voicing some opinion
about her or by helping Anna toward
her righteous goal of regaining cus
tody, they are somehow making their
miserable yuppie existences more
plausible in the eyes of God. And —
once again, folks, you're ahead of me
by a mile — all this ideological prat
tling is at the cost of characterization.
It may very well be that Miller
assumes the reader will infer what
she's getting at: "Molly's special be
cause any mother/daughter relation
ship inherently transcends the limita
tions of the people themselves." But
she should let us find that out for our
selves through the characters. In this
case, they are so inadequately drawn
that (given Miller's desire to have
each character rally around the
transcendent parent-child relation
ship) we can't believe that any mom
and kid are that transcendent.
One reviewer compared "The
Good Mother" to other novels with
classic heroines (such as Elizabeth
Bennett and Anna Karenina). That
seems to be stretching things quite a
bit. The writer in question must have
been casting about, in her dazzlement
with the novel, for some epic
generalization to tie this effort to the
entire tradition of Western literature,
which Miller clearly echoes, but fails
to expand.
Not that she'll care. After all, when
you've got a novel rising in the Top
10 of the New York Times bestsel
ler list and a dizzyingly receptive
review from the same make-or-break
paper to boot, it's hard to care about
literary tradition.

"The Good Mother"
By Sue Miller
Harper and Row
$17.95
The reviews on this one were
clearly unclear — The New York
Times nearly frothed at the mouth on
the front page of its book review sup
plement, calling Sue Miller a writer
who, with her very first novel, had
managed to rocket into the literary
stratosphere, far beyond the level
more experienced writers (Judith
Krantz? John Le Carre?) could even
fantasize about attaining.
Shortly after that breathless bit of
praise, The Los Angeles Times came
out with an unenthusiastic appraisal
— Miller had certain gifts, the
reviewer sniffed, but the fact that this
was, after all, only her first novel
shone through blindingly. Her prose,
the reviewer said, suffered from
preachiness, sentimentality — in
short, everything a first novel should
avoid like the plague. "The Good
Mother" was for the most part some
thing of a dandelion — attractive,
fluffy, even enticing, but ultimately so
much seed in the wind.
Actually, the divergence of opinion
here probably says more about the
flaws of book review journalism
(given its penchant for deceit and
patronage) than about Miller's
novel. But that's another issue al
together. Ultimately, "The Good
Mother" is neither so scintillating nor
so abysmal that you won't find any
thing to agree with in either review
(or this one). Sorry, folks. A master
piece this ain't.
"The Good Mother" has a lot
going for it. Miller, an accomplished
short-storv writer and sometime col
lege professor, clearly knows her stuff

when it comes to prose style. (She's
read Strunk and White like any con
scientious writer "should.") Rarely
are words wasted in this novel; when
Miller does err, it's generally on the
side of minimalism — and that's for
the good, as any of her colleagues
would tell you in a minute. Miller also
has a startlingly apt eye for physical
detail that yanks you into the setting
of the story (almost dislocating your
shoulder in the process) instead of
leaving you on the sidelines like some
vaguely unwelcome bystander. Her
attention to the effect of exposed
human skin on the beholder,
repeated throughout the novel, is
particularly revealing.
Miller's main character in this out
ing, Anna Dunlap, is the only child of
a puritanical Eastern couple; they are
so puritanical, in fact, that Anna re

whom she subsequently shacks up
with. Molly falls in cherubic love with
him, which pleases Anna to no end;
she wants so much for Molly kins to
be happy and well-adjusted. But if
Anna can be happy in the bargain —
well, that's just too much to ask for,
almost.

Sue Miller really
shows her stuff
when it comes to
prose style.

Or more than almost. Ex-hubby
takes Molly away for the weekend
soon thereafter and learns in the
course of idle conversation with his
daughter that Leo, at the child's be
hest, briefly displayed his genitals to
her after a shower one morning. It
also comes out that Anna let the child
climb into bed with her, to be com
forted after a nightmare — right in
the middle of some jollies with Leo.
So all this sexual permissiveness adds
up to a no-no; Anna's ex-hubby turns
red with Protestant disgust and files a
custody suit the next day.
This happens in the middle of the
novel; the remainder takes a too
leisurely jaunt through all the pre
trial, during-trial and post-trial
proceedings, giving us every single
syllable of court dialogue (even the
cops at the door get to put in their

two cents) and dissecting the tiniest
reaction Anna has.
That's about it as far as plot goes —
and it's symptomatic of a broader
problem with "The Good Mother" as
a whole.
Miller has written, in essence, a
classic yuppie drama — in the literary
fallout to come in the next decade or
so, observers will probably rank this
effort among the top 10 to 15 novels
typifying the upwardly mobile
Weltanschauung. There's the stand
ards; introspective bitching and
moaning; psychological angst; weari
ness, anxiety and dread; and the eter
nal bugaboo, to be avoided at almost
any cost — maladjustment.
Of more importance to the literary
character of the novel, however, is
Miller's failure to adhere to the old
English 001 saw "Show, don't tell."
(She, of all people, should know bet
ter.) To those readers with cynical at
titudes toward literature, "The Good
Mother" might seem little more than
a 310-page string of self-indulgent
(and frequently self-pitying) mental
posturings. Miller gives the novel to
Anna Dunlap, writing her novel en
tirely in the first person; and because
this is her first effort, she might not
have been as vigilant to trim herchar
acter's excesses as she might have.
Her editors should have caught this,
though. For them, there truly is no
excuse.
So we get a lot of analysis: why
Anna felt this way at this moment in
time — and, oh, lest you think her
possibly neurotic (Lord forbid!), the
rationale in her past to explain her
behavior away\ Miller seems to
assume that all this psychobabble can
take the place, somehow, of character
development. That just isn't the case.
And (getting back to Molly
dearest) neither is that the case with
ideology. Molly is used as a quoit in a
game of ideological horseshoes

throughout the novel, as a symbol for
a set of virtues larger than any one of
the characters themselves. Like
Joseph's brothers at the sight of his
multi-colored coat, every other char
acter Anna meets suddenly wants a
stake in things when they hear about
Molly.
It's as if by voicing some opinion
about her or by helping Anna toward
her righteous goal of regaining cus
tody, they are somehow making their
miserable yuppie existences more
plausible in the eyes of God. And —
once again, folks, you're ahead of me
by a mile — all this ideological prat
tling is at the cost of characterization.
It may very well be that Miller
assumes the reader will infer what
she's getting at: "Molly's special be
cause any mother/daughter relation
ship inherently transcends the limita
tions of the people themselves." But
she should let us find that out for our
selves through the characters. In this
case, they are so inadequately drawn
that (given Miller's desire to have
each character rally around the
transcendent parent-child relation
ship) we can't believe that any mom
and kid are that transcendent.
One reviewer compared "The
Good Mother" to other novels with
classic heroines (such as Elizabeth
Bennett and Anna Karenina). That
seems to be stretching things quite a
bit. The writer in question must have
been casting about, in her dazzlement
with the novel, for some epic
generalization to tie this effort to the
entire tradition of Western literature,
which Miller clearly echoes, but fails
to expand.
Not that she'll care. After all, when
you've got a novel rising in the Top
10 of the New York Times bestsel
ler list and a dizzyingly receptive
review from the same make-or-break
paper to boot, it's hard to care about
literary tradition.

"The Good Mother"
By Sue Miller
Harper and Row
$17.95
The reviews on this one were
clearly unclear — The New York
Times nearly frothed at the mouth on
the front page of its book review sup
plement, calling Sue Miller a writer
who, with her very first novel, had
managed to rocket into the literary
stratosphere, far beyond the level
more experienced writers (Judith
Krantz? John Le Carre?) could even
fantasize about attaining.
Shortly after that breathless bit of
praise, The Los Angeles Times came
out with an unenthusiastic appraisal
— Miller had certain gifts, the
reviewer sniffed, but the fact that this
was, after all, only her first novel
shone through blindingly. Her prose,
the reviewer said, suffered from
preachiness, sentimentality — in
short, everything a first novel should
avoid like the plague. "The Good
Mother" was for the most part some
thing of a dandelion — attractive,
fluffy, even enticing, but ultimately so
much seed in the wind.
Actually, the divergence of opinion
here probably says more about the
flaws of book review journalism
(given its penchant for deceit and
patronage) than about Miller's
novel. But that's another issue al
together. Ultimately, "The Good
Mother" is neither so scintillating nor
so abysmal that you won't find any
thing to agree with in either review
(or this one). Sorry, folks. A master
piece this ain't.
"The Good Mother" has a lot
going for it. Miller, an accomplished
short-storv writer and sometime col
lege professor, clearly knows her stuff

when it comes to prose style. (She's
read Strunk and White like any con
scientious writer "should.") Rarely
are words wasted in this novel; when
Miller does err, it's generally on the
side of minimalism — and that's for
the good, as any of her colleagues
would tell you in a minute. Miller also
has a startlingly apt eye for physical
detail that yanks you into the setting
of the story (almost dislocating your
shoulder in the process) instead of
leaving you on the sidelines like some
vaguely unwelcome bystander. Her
attention to the effect of exposed
human skin on the beholder,
repeated throughout the novel, is
particularly revealing.
Miller's main character in this out
ing, Anna Dunlap, is the only child of
a puritanical Eastern couple; they are
so puritanical, in fact, that Anna re
members weekends with her mother's
relatives far more vividly than week
days with her parents themselves.
(Her parents aren't necessarily
boring; they're just sort of stodgy,
that's all.)
But don't let the word
"puritanical" throw you. Anna gets
raised so well it makes any real par
ents look like depraved child-abusers
by comparison. That's the trouble, it
turns out; Anna is raised too well. It's
bound to show up later — after all,
Anna will come of age in the '80s,
when psychological introspection and
troubleshooting are all the rage.
Anyway, that's just the background
stuff. The upshot is that Anna gets
married to a puritanical hubby
(whom she'd have avoided like the
plague had she had the chance to read
"Smart Women, Foolish Choices").
They have a daughter —
miraculously, it turns out, given
Anna's predilection to lapse into exis
tential dread in the middle of the act.
And, in the daughter's fourth year or
thereabouts, the Dunlaps separate

and then divorce.
The novel's point of departure is
this daughter, Molly by name. Now,
Molly is nothing special — ostensibly,
she's just another child of the '80s,
whining, precocious, stubborn and
spoiled as can be. (She's the Punky
Brewster of belles lettres.)

Ah, but Miller has plans for this
tyke. She clearly intends Molly's
presence as something of a symbol —
say, for the sanctity of childrearing,
the purity and unassailability of the
baby stroller, or what have you. So
even though Molly is little more than
a cipher herself (after all, how much
character development can you get
out of a four-year-old, right?), her
aura looms large and portentous
throughout the novel. She is, after all,
Anna's reason for living, the reason
she lets all the other relationships in
her life (parents, pals, hubby, even —
God forbid — lover) go to hell in a
handbasket.
The bare essentials of the rest of
the plot (without giving away the
double-twist ending) are as follows;
After the divorce, Anna meets a
leonine man (hence his name, Leo)

whom she subsequently shacks up
with. Molly falls in cherubic love with
him, which pleases Anna to no end;
she wants so much for Molly kins to
be happy and well-adjusted. But if
Anna can be happy in the bargain —
well, that's just too much to ask for,
almost.
