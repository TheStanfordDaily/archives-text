## "The new taste of the old South"

To graduating seniors planning for a suc
cessful Commencement weekend, deciding
where to eat in San Francisco is a matter of no
trivial importance. In the eyes of a good many
friends and relatives, the "successful"
graduate will be gauged not only by classroom
achievement, but by less tangible attainments
in taste and style that accompany four years of
living in a great metropolitan area.
According to Stanford tradition, the post
graduation dinner experience has ranged
from "roughing it" at Sam Wo's to shelling
out big bucks for abalone at Alioto's. But
thanks to maverick restauranteer R. Sam
DuVall, the Class of '86 has another choice:
Samantha's.
Tucked behind the spankingly modern
brick-and-glass walls of Levi's Plaza,
Samantha's hearkens back to an elegant era
of oak, brass and crystal. The setting is an
ideal medium in which to convey what is still
an essentially different and exciting message:

To bring "the new taste of the old South" to
the Bay Area.
Unless you've lived in the South or spent a
summer interning in Washington, D.C., a
menu featuring cheese grits, crab and corn
chowder and bread pudding may be a map to
unexplored territory. But don't let that stand
in your way. By blending the best in Cajun
and Creole with a touch of California,
Samantha's makes Southern cooking both ac
cessible and affordable.
The Mississippi-born DuVall, who also
owns the Ritz Cafes in New York and Los
Angeles, has emerged as one of America's
most celebrated promoters of Cajun and
Creole cooking. After pioneering the Elite
Cafe on San Francisco's Fillmore Street in
1981, he opened the slick Cafe Royale at
Pacific and Van Ness a few years later.
"Sam's idea was to take Southern cooking
and broaden its appeal," says Samantha's
manager, Lawrence Casperson. "More than
anyone else, he was responsible for bringing
Cajon and Creole food to the Bay Area."
DuVall sold the Elite about a year ago and
closed Cafe Royale in January, the same
month he launched Samantha's.
With Samantha's, DuVall dared to sever his
ties with the yuppie crowd that tended to fre

quent his previous ventures. His success is
everywhere apparent: gone are the moussed
blunt cuts and poplin suits.
And even on a Wednesday night, the place
is packed.
"Sam isn't interested in being fashionable'
just for the sake of fashion," says Casperson.
"Cafe Royale was at the cutting edge of Cali
fornia nouvelle. But now we're moving away
from the slick, high-tech restaurant. Sam
wanted a stately, rich, warm feeling in the
traditional San Francisco restaurant style."
At Samantha's, "traditional San Francisco
style" begins with, an exceptional list of
domestic and imported wines and cham
pagnes. At Casperson's suggestion, we shared
a bottle of Beauregard Chardonnay' 84 ($ 11).
Crisp but not sharp, the Beauregard provided
a link with the Napa Valley as we departed on
an odyssey through the less-familiar in
tricacies of the Southern cuisine.
For the courageous, Samantha's also offers
an exquisite array of cocktails, including
plantation milk punch ($3.25), the Cajun
martini ($2.75) and Samantha's cocktail ($4),
a blend of champagne, Grand Marnier and
orange juice. Sipping one or two of these is
made easier by the restaurant's expansive oak
bar, which is to be senved by a new menu of

snacks and light entrees in the near future.
For appetizers, the menu runs the gamut
from fresh asparagus with Smithfield ham
($5.50) to duck and sausage gumbo ($3.75).
Just smelling the Maryland crabcakes ($6.95)
recalled warm summer nights on the An
napolis waterfront. In the authentic fashion,
Samantha's dips patties of shredded crab
meat in a seasoned corn batter and fries them
to a golden brown.
For dinner breads, Samantha's offers some
uncommonly good choices, including corn
muffins and rolls with raisins and caraway
seeds. The latter is possibly the best tasting
ensemble available anywhere.
Samantha's entrees range in price from fet
tucini with Andoville and sweet peppers
($7.50) to blackened filet mignon with sweet
potato tamale and six variations of soft shell
crab, each for $14.95. We selected the
drunken shrimp ($13.95) and the soft shell
crabs, Louisiana style.
Cooked in beer and spices, the drunken
shrimp were superb. There were more than
enough of them to be satisfying, and the ac
companying sauce was a real tribute to the
talents of Samantha's chefs Thomas Brown of
New Orleans and Farnham Hogue, formerly
of Cafe Roy ale.

The soft shelled crab was remarkably fresh,
which came as no surprise considering that
Samantha's flies them in daily from
Chesapeake Bay. Served with lemon and gar
lic butter, the crabs lived up to their name:
They were entirely edible, with the legs and
claws providing a crunchy frame to a suc
culent interior.
On the side, Samantha's serves fresh
steamed vegetables that, like the dinner
breads, deserve special attention. A slight
criticism: On a Wednesday night, the steamed
wild rice was bland, but this could be
remedied by a bit more seasoning.
Dessert was nothing short of an incredible
experience. The fresh strawberries with
