Conformity. It is the evil residue of Corporate
America fouling the very air we breathe. We now
find ourselves in a sinister age in which even restau
rants have fallen prey to the opiate of mediocrity:
torn naugehyde seat cushions; bent, use ess ash
trays made of tin foil; semi-melted pads of polyun
saturated margarine wrapped in waxpaper; and
bear-shaped catsup squeeze bottles next to minty
flavored toothpick dispensers.
But there is an escape.
Journey a few short miles down El Camino Real
to the one guiding beacon of dining self
determination — Sirloin and Brew Unlimited.
Allies of dining integrity will flock to this mecca
amid the mire of institutionalized feeding. Smiles
will tug at the corners of their mouths as they enter

this throwback to the fashions and interior design
trends of 1973. False ceilings, fireplace facades, an
over-abundance of real and imitation wood, and
glass candle holders which defy description greet
hungry mid-Peninsula travelers.
Here, visitors choose from a tasty but reasonably
priced array of steakhouse fare. Our selections in
cluded a generous and tender portion of chicken
breast teriyaki ($6.95), an equally enjoyable
steak kabob ($7.25) and a satisfactory steak and
lobster tail combo ($10.95 — the most expensive
choice on the menu). Dinner is served between 4
p.m. and 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and until
10 p.m. on all other days.
While it is not the finest of cuisines, it is ideal for
hungry college students who are trying to find a
hearty steak dinner at a reasonable price. Simply
put, it is good food at a fair price. It gets a thumbs
up from all three Daily reviewers.
Amazingly, each dinner entree comes with a
potato, all the salad you can eat and all the soup
you want. Also included in the price is an unlimited
supply of bread, condiments and beverages, includ
ing beer, wine, sangria and soda.
The unlimitedness of Sirloin and Brew is perhaps

its most attractive and intriguing feature. Combine
this with the impeccable service of smartly dressed
waiters and you have an enjoyable evening for you
and your friends.
The potential for fun is not limited to the dining
experience alone. Sirloin and Brew is a combina
tion of Denny's-style restaurant chain technology
and a clever application of modern-day advertising
gimmicks. Sirloin and Brew Unlimited President
Ed Driscoll, a restauranteering wizard, has master
minded a list of "25 Ways Sirloin and Brew Does
More For You!" Each of the 25 declarations is a
means of fighting what Driscoll calls " Double Digit
Dinnerhouse Inflation." They include: no white
coat valets who hold your car ransom, no "postage
stamp-size plates" discouraging you from taking as
much salad as you want and an iron-clad steak
guarantee promising a replacement steak to un
satisfied customers.
We humbly suggest that Mr. Driscoll add a 26th
edict to his list: Sirloin and Brew Unlimited prom
ises to provide an entertaining and sometimes edu
cational alternative to the juggernaut of bland, life
less eateries which pockmark the face of our
country.
