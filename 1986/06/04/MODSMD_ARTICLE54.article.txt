Dinah's Poolside Coffeeshop is
indeed that â€” a coffee shop by the
pool.
It is an especially enjoyable setting
on sunny weekend mornings when
one wishes simply to sit back in a
patio chair with a Chronicle and a
bottomless cup of coffee. Breakfast
comes without a morning dip; less ex
hibitionist hotel patrons use another
pool to get in their exercise..
The pool does provide a pleasant
atmosphere and a quiet refuge from
El Camino Real. Diners may also sit
inside where the atmosphere is more
akin to a diner or coffeeshop, replete
with baby blue vinyl chairs and for
mica tables.
Dinah's is in the process of expand
ing, and soon will have added indoor
capacity and a fireplace to provide an
attractive option for the less-than
sunny days.
After a couple cups of coffee while
we waited, we sat down under an
umbrella and perused the menu.
Dinah's claims over 65,000 combina
tions of their famous Poolside
omelets, a figure achieved by various
permutations of the 24 ingredients,
each of which can be added to the
price of a plain omelet ($2.90) for
$.40 to $1.60.
Ingredients range from shrimp to
sausage, from ortega chiles to
pineapple. Incase some patrons can't
make up their minds, "Dinah" has
put together a few favorite combina
tions of her own. Some of the peren
nial favorites include: The Feather
($6) which contains ham, onion,
Swiss cheese and tomato; The Buf
falo ($6.30) which contains bacon,
mushroom, tomato and American
cheese; and the Importer ($6.70)
which contains shrimp, Swiss cheese,
onion, mushroom and tomato.
The omelet I chose, The Im
porter, was loaded with tasty ingredi
ents, but could have been improved
with fresher ingredients (the mush
rooms were canned) and more
seasoning.
My companion ordered The Nun

ley ($6.30), which was made of a mel
low combination of turkey, cream
cheese, avocado and tomato. Al
though the ingredients were fresh,
their combined flavor was perhaps
too mellow, lacking the seasoning
that could have made it more inter
esting. Dinah's does provide, upon
request, Picante sauce to spice up
your omelet.
Each order is served with a hearty
portion of grated hash browns and
buttered toast with Knott's Berry
Farm jelly. Cottage cheese or sliced
tomato may be substituted for hash
browns.
Dinah's also offers seven breakfast
combinations, featuring any style of
eggs, buttermilk pancakes, French
toast, cereal, and ham, bacon or
sausage. These range from $2.80 to
$4.30.
Another heading on the Dinah's
menu is "Poolside's Eggs and
Pancakes." This includes linguica and
two eggs ($4.50), New York steak
and two eggs ($6.95) and an enticing
array of fruit-filled pancakes
(blueberry, apple, strawberry and
banana).
Acknowledging that we may roll,
instead of walk, out of Dinah's, my
breakfast partner and 1 decided to
split an order of banana pancakes
($2.90). We were glad that we did.
The pancakes were not only deli
cious, but they were not unduly
heavy. The buttermilk batter was
light and flavorful and filled with
sweet slices of banana.
All the pancakes are topped with a
small scoop of butter and served with
the choice of maple or blueberry
syrup. The fruit-filled pancakes are
not to be missed!
To complete one's breakfast,
Dinah's offers fresh-squeezed orange
juice in addition to grapefruit, tomato
and V-8, and also a selection of
seasonal fruits.
At the conclusion of our meal, my
companion and I were completely
content and caffeinated, ready to face
a long day of studying. All the por
tions are quite generous, the service
excellent and the atmosphere pleas
ant and relaxing. If you are looking
for an excuse to put off studying for
finals or you just wake up hungry for
a hearty breakfast, Dinah's should lit
the bill.
