I had to work hard to think of
something negative to say about my
brunch last Sunday at Hobee's.
Sometime during the ride back to
Stanford, thank God, my three com
panions and I hit on something that
would keep my review from becom
ing a soppy, gushing rave. Here it is:
The water glasses weren't refilled
quite as often as they could have
been.
That's it. Other than the water,
Hobee's served up the most enjoy
able brunch — both in taste and at
mosphere — that I have had in a long
time. If you're among the small
percentage of Stanford students who
have not yet heard of this con
veniently located, reasonably priced
rave-fave restaurant, give yourself a
finals week treat and check it out.
We arrived around 1 p.m. and were
seated within 10 minutes. (I had
heard that there might be a fairly long
wait, but the afternoon hour
eliminated that problem.) Our table
was next to an open window in the
smaller outer area, a comfortable
white and blue room with a small
skylight.
I ordered the 12-Hour Ommie, an
omelet made with mushrooms, rice,
black bean chili and a blend of three
cheeses. Included in the $5.25 price
was a choice of homemade cof
feecake (large and very good), toast
or hashbrowns. I took the
hashbrowns.
I had never had an omelet with
chili before, and I was amazed at how
good it was. It was nearly a foot long,
mildly spicy and filled generously
with the mushrooms, rice and beans.
Highly, highly recommended.
The other three dishes at our table
were a cheese omelet with sauteed
fresh tofu added ($.75 extra) an All
Organic omelet with sprouts, mush
rooms, tomatoes, green peppers and

cheese, and a Florentine scramble
with spinach, mushrooms and cheese.
All omelets and scrambles are $5.25.
The tofu omelet was interesting —
I'm not real big on tofu, so 1 won t
pass judgment on it, but the person
who ordered it said it was excellent. I
was much more excited about the
Florentine scramble, a really deli
cious mixed omelet. The All Organic
got equally high marks.

It was nearly a
foot long, mildly
spicy and filled
with the mush
rooms, rice and
beans. Highly,
highly recom
mended.

The nice thing about Hobee's is
that they put a little extra effort into
everything they do. The service wa<s
prompt and friendly; all of the ser
vings were extremely generous; the
orange juice was fresh-squeezed; and
coffee refills were free. I left the res
taurant feeling that I had been well
treated, and that I would be back.
Wait — one last negative comr
ment: there was no chalk under the
graffiti chalkboard in the men's bath
room. But that shouldn't stop you
from paying a visit to the best break
fast/lunch/brunch place in town.
Besides the Town and Country lo
cation, there are Hobee's Restaurants
in Palo Alto at 4224 El Camino Real
and Mountain View at 2312 Central
Expressway. The T & C Hobee's is
the only one that serves dinners
