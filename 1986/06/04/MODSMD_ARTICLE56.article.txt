The door closes, quietly but
firmly. Two tall figures stand inside
the entrance. The darkly-lit interior
reveals only two other patrons,
seated at one of the many tables in
the cantina. Behind the bar, the
owner silently wipes a shot-glass,
watching the two strangers in silent
expectation.
Well, not quite.
But Taco Aguillila did remind
me of a scene from a spaghetti
Western (preferably one with Clint
in it, but I'll take just about any
thing.)
My partner and I seated our
selves at the only table for two,

which had a nice view of the side
street where it intersects with Mid
dlefield. A couple of interesting
cars cruised by while we were
there; they were a good diversion.
1 always sit with my back to the
wall, right hand free, so I had a
good view of the inside of Taco
Aguillila. It was a pretty standard
scene for a Northern California
Mexican restaurant: dark tables on
Spanish tile floors, low orange
lamps hanging from the ceiling and
a sombrero hanging on the wall.
Where the bar should have been,
there was instead a cafeteria-style
counter, where appetizers and food
to go were kept warm. It was a little
too reminiscent of food service, so I
didn't look too closely.
A random juke-box on one wall
broke the overall Mexican flavor of
the place. Luckily, the other two
patrons in the restaurant had not
paid a quarter to hear such tasteful
music as ABBA or REO Speed
wagon. Instead we all sat and lis
tened to what sounded like Johnny

Mathis tunes piped through the
sound system.
The restaurant is a family-owned
operation, and our waitress was ap
parently the mother. She could
hardly speak English, which added
to the Mexican atmosphere but
created some difficulty when my
Russian-speaking partner and I
tried to make ourselves under
stood.
The food offered at Taco Aguil
lila ranges in price from a single
burritofor $1.75 to a complete din
ner for $5.95. Tacos, burritos and
enchiladas are the basic fare, al
though daily specials and other
items are also offered.
I ordered the chicken special
with salad ($4.95), which turned
out to be much more than I could
possibly eat. Two large chicken
breasts smothered with a spicy red
sauce were served with ample por
tions of Spanish rice and refried
beans. On a separate plate came
four corn tortillas, which were cov
ered to keep warm. With the good
sized salad, dessert and complimen
tary tortilla chips and salsa, my
meal was really enough for two
people.
My partner chose the chicken
burrito with rice and beans and a
salad ($4.95). His dinner was also
too much for him to eat, although
he didn't succumb to the doggy-bag
as I did. Although my chicken was a
bit dry, his seemed to be almost
perfectly done. We both enjoyed
the rice and beans equally, and we
shared my corn tortillas, which I
wish had been wheat, but they were
good anyway.
For dessert we split one order of
flan ($1.25). This was the best flan
I have ever tasted. Usually the cus
tard is too bland and the almond
sauce too sweet, but Taco Aguillila
managed to make the two tastes
balance perfectly.
Although we stuck with Cokes
for our beverage, there were also
beers and wine coolers (including
the new Harley Davidson brand)
available.
Taco Aguillila is a good place to
go for cheap food if you're in the
Menlo Park area. The service is fast
(almost rushed) and the atmos
phere pleasant enough for a casual
night out. With a full stomach and a
full wallet, you will leave Taco
Aguillila feeling the small amount
of money you have spent has been
well worth it.

balance perfectly.
Although we stuck with Cokes
for our beverage, there were also
beers and wine coolers (including
the new Harley Davidson brand)
available.
Taco Aguillila is a good place to
go for cheap food if you're in the
Menlo Park area. The service is fast
(almost rushed) and the atmos
phere pleasant enough for a casual
night out. With a full stomach and a
full wallet, you will leave Taco
Aguillila feeling the small amount
of money you have spent has been
well worth it.
