# Pasta at the new Cenzo's is authentic as Italy itself

Cenzo's
233 University
Palo Alto
322-1846
University Avenue has a new addition (and we're not
talking about the famous fast food joint which shall
remain nameless). What used to be a sign reading "Caffe
Santa Maddalena's" is now a sign for "Cenzo's." Still un
der the same ownership and still boasting Italian cuisine,
but. . . different.
The restaurant remodeled its gourmet buffet-style diner
into an elegant sit-down affair. The room is done all in
peach and holds about 25 small tables, each with white
linen cloths and candles. Hanging baskets full of meat and
cheeses adorn the open kitchen display.
The old Caffe Santa Maddalena never lacked wonderful
service. Busboys would whisk your tray straight from the
cash register to a prime table. Well, the new Cenzo's
hasn't lost the touch. The waiter-busboy combination
here keeps the customers highly satisfied.
The wine list at Cenzo's is well thought out (and dis
played both on the tables and a chalkboard above the
food preparation area). We chose a half carafe of the
house red, which was served in a wonderful decorated
porcelain pitcher. And true Italian wine it was! The bread,
called focaccia, served at the same time was also very au
thentic— it interestingly resembled seasoned pizza crusts.
We began by sharing a large Caesar salad for $5.50.
The creation was not mixed at the table but was filled with
juicy pieces of Romaine lettuce, cheese and the crunchiest
croutons around. We thought, however, the dressing was
a little mild — it lacked a stronger taste of anchovies.
Our "primi" arrived before we could finish our salads.
Excellent fried calamari for $6.95. The paper-thin batter
was perfectly seasoned and didn't hide what it covered.
And what it covered was unusually tender and not its typi
cal rubbery texture. Great calamari here!
For our entrees, we both chose selections in the "pasta"
category rather than the "secondi." It is truly amazing
that Italians can always fit both in their stomachs.
"Secondi" items at Cenzo's include a prawns alia scampi,
chicken breast Cenzo, calamari steak all'Amaretto, egg
plant parmigiana and veal marsala. Prices range from
$6.95 to $10.95.
We ordered the tortellini gorgonzola and fettuccine
d'Adriatico, both for around $9. Other pasta items in
clude lasagne, linguine and clams, cannellone and
taglierini primavera.
The fettuccini d'Adriatico is highly recommended. For

us, the highlight of this dish was not the tasty, big prawns,
but the flawless sauce. Made with white wine, garlic, but
ter and absolutely the perfect amount of lemon, this sauce
should have a very proud maker.
The tortellini gorgonzola was another wonderful dish.
The sauce was similar to the fettuccini sauce (we think
they start with the same base) but stressed different
spices. Here, the nutmeg was essential and enhanced the
moist pieces of tortellini. Also included, but definitely not
needed, in this pasta creation were long bits of ham.
Although the pasta was filling enough (plenty to take
home to the dog), we still couldn't resist tasting one of the
desserts. We chose the blueberry cheesecake ($2.25)
along with two espressos ($1.25 eash). Blueberries were
whipped into the top layer of the cream cheese batter to
make this "yummy" dessert.
You can be assured of good Italian cuisine and very
friendly service at Cenzo's Restaurant. We've always
liked Caffe Santa Maddalena, but their new idea certainly
doesn't disappoint us at all.
Cenzo's accepts credit cards, has a similar lunch menu
and can arrange for complete dinners to go.
Mangia, mangia!
