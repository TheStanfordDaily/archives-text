## Picasso film blurs cinematic borders 
### STEVE WARRICK Senior staff writer 
Cinema purists might have prob
lems with "The Mystery of Picasso"
("Le Mystere Picasso"), but the rest
of us needn't worry about them.
There were once critical factions
that looked down on movies which
"borrowed"' material from other
sources; they felt that movies should
be a "pure" art form, without any re
lationship to the other arts. Today it's
pretty clear that such a restrictive def
inition would exclude some very en
joyable, even great, films.
Think of all the adaptations of
novels ("The Makioka Sisters," "A
Room with a View") and plays
("Come Back to the Five and Dime,
Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean," Olivier's
"Othello") and even concerts ("Stop
Making Sense") that have made won
derful films and you understand the
blurred boundaries of what might be
considered truly "cinematic." No
other art form encompasses all the
arts in the way film can — yet even
today, film critics don't seem entirely
comfortable discussing movies
adapted from other mediums.
At least, that's the only possible
reason I can come up with for the
ridiculously Jukewarm reception Bay
Area reviewers have given to "The
Mystery of Picasso," filmed in 1955
but only now going into widespread
general release. Part of the problem
may be that this film truly is a special
case, both in its subject and in its way
of presenting him.
The subject is, of course, Pablo
Picasso, and for the 85-minute dura
tion of this film we watch him
produce 15 paintings on a series of
canvasses which take the shape of the
movie screen. The paintings appear,
line by line, stroke by stroke, as if by
magic — both they and Picasso's
technique itself probably require an
art critic to do them full justice, but it
doesn't take a critic to know that,
while watching this movie, we're in
the presence of an awe-inspiring tal
ent.
"The Mystery of Picasso" doesn't
have a lot of things we associate with
a great movie. There is virtually no
dialogue, and the little we hear
usually has nothing to do with what
we see happening on the screen. The
performers — filmmaker Henri-
Georges Clouzot, photographer
Claude Renoir and Picasso himself —
appear only a couple of times, for a
few minutes, and they all seem fairly
amused by the whole enterprise, as if
making this movie were just a few
hours of fun in their lives.
But the sly wit of these making-of
the-movie scenes is really rooted in
Picasso's paintings themselves, and
it's safe to assume that Clouzot, who
directed and wrote the brief passages
of dialogue, was inspired by his artist
friend.
The whole of this film is inspired;
you don't see many films that express
such sheer delight in the potential of

movies. There's a sense of discovery,
of doing something new and exciting,
that accompanies this film. When this
theme is made explicit — as it is in the
opening scenes of Picasso wandering
through his studio — the mood is
somewhat destroyed, and the film
threatens to become high-brow and
tony.
Clouzot himself narrates the early
scenes, and he asks things like how
much we would give to know what
Mozart was thinking when he wrote
"The Jupiter Symphony." He says
that by following the movements of
the painter's brushstroke, we can
penetrate his "mystery," and follow
the movements of his mind. (These
passages, unfortunately, also give us a
bad first impression of Georges
Auric's score, which swells impor
tantly in the background.)
This narration sounds like perfect
nonsense, and so it is; but we aren't
really put off, because it's accompa
nied by scenes of Picasso standing
amidst huge Expressionist canvasses,
and the imagery is so expressive that
all our fears are allayed.
This movie doesn't explain the
mystery of Picasso, but do we really
want it to? The man we see in the
opening scenes is practically a work
of art himself — stripped bare to the
waist, with the barrel chest of a
wrestler, a bald, smooth head and a
hawkish profile. He stands in his
studio and contemplates his paintings
as if he, too, can't explain them — as
if he's just seen something in them he
hadn't seen before, something which
he can't quite figure out.
The first painting appears in abso
lute silence; the camera cuts from the
darkness of the studio to the blank
canvas, and the first black ink slowly
appears. The camera sits behind the
canvas, and Picasso's special ink
bleeds through instantly. The ink
ends up forming part of a man — an
artist, sitting on the ground, hunched
forward and painting. In the back
ground lies a prone nude woman.
The painting begins with simple
detail which develops steadily, but is
subsequently blotted out by sweeps of
black; the sketch seems much more
primitive when it's finished, and it
sets the tone for the rest of the paint
ings. (Picasso rarely gives us a clue
when he's approaching the end of a
painting, and Auric's musical accom
paniment follows his lead; often it
simply stops, with no drama or
fanfare.)
The first half of the movie is a se
ries of ink paintings, often starting
with a black ink sketch which is
quickly transformed by bursts of
color. Picasso may reverse our expec
tations by beginning a painting with a
bold streak of blue, following with
other colors and then filling in the ink
detail. And Auric's score fits the
mood of each painting; he supplies vi
brant percussion, wailing trumpets or
fanfare when Picasso does one of his
many bullfighting scenes.

The first half is an exhilarating les
son in the power of even the simplest
drawings, and after the first couple of
paintings, we begin to notice things
we weren't prepared to notice before;
Picasso plays little artistic games that
draw us into his technique.
The same characters appear from
painting to painting, perhaps in dif
ferent guises but often in the same
profile. Faces appear in snatches of
background. He paints a quick still
life of an eggplant on a platter, and
then does the same still-life but in
serts a brownish skull next to a blue
coffee pot and green onions.
Some sketches appear and disap
pear so quickly they're like visual
haiku — they stab at our subcon
scious with a sharp thrust. And when,
after an intricate, decorative montage

of patterns and faces, the camera is
suddenly lifted out of the camera
frame, it's like the punchline of an ex
tended joke. This isn't museum piece
art, to be hung on a wall; this is art
that moves, that springs to life on the
screen. It's like the best cartoon
animation you've ever seen.
A short interlude in the film gives
Picasso time to mix his paints and
Clouzot time to have a smoke. Even
Claude Renoir (grandson of Auguste,
and maybe the most versatile photog
rapher in the history of cinema —
he's worked on projects as diverse as
"La Grande Illusion" and"The Spy
Who Loved Me") gets his moment in
the sun; he leans from behind the
camera for a quizzical "Oui?" to a
question from Clouzot.
We sit behind Picasso for a quick

painting; it's quick because the film is
running out in the camera, and the
painting turns out to be a refreshing,
amusing divertissement (we get to fol
low the movements of his hand here,
and they're so expressive they leave
us wishing for more). After some
inks, however, Picasso wants to do
something with more depth, and
Henri suggests moving to oils, which
he can film with stop-motion shots of
the stages of the painting. It's with the
oils that Picasso really unleashes his
talent, and the movie rockets into the
creative stratosphere.
One painting goes from a simple
skull to a practically three
dimensional goat's head in about five
minutes. In another we see a prone
nude woman who goes through
various expressions while reading a

book; the painting culminates in a
cubist gaze of perfect ennui. A scene
of a bullfighter draped over a bull
gets two variations in oil, one with
deep earth browns and reds that are
utterly astounding.
And when Picasso ends with an
ever-changing fresco that goes on and
on, and then pauses to assess what
he's done, he notes that he's finally
getting to "the surprising truth at the
bottom of the well," and we can't
help but believe him. After a few
more strokes he stands back and says,
"This is bad. This is very, very bad."
In this film, Picasso is a master of
both the grand gesture and the per
fect, self-deflating barb. He gives a
hell of a performance, and at the end
of it, he signs his name to the film
with a fluorish.

that by following the movements of
the painter's brushstroke, we can
penetrate his "mystery," and follow
the movements of his mind. (These
passages, unfortunately, also give us a
bad first impression of Georges
Auric's score, which swells impor
tantly in the background.)
This narration sounds like perfect
nonsense, and so it is; but we aren't
really put off, because it's accompa
nied by scenes of Picasso standing
amidst huge Expressionist canvasses,
and the imagery is so expressive that
all our fears are allayed.
This movie doesn't explain the
mystery of Picasso, but do we really
want it to? The man we see in the
opening scenes is practically a work
of art himself — stripped bare to the
waist, with the barrel chest of a
wrestler, a bald, smooth head and a
hawkish profile. He stands in his
studio and contemplates his paintings
as if he, too, can't explain them — as
if he's just seen something in them he
hadn't seen before, something which
he can't quite figure out.
The first painting appears in abso
lute silence; the camera cuts from the
darkness of the studio to the blank
canvas, and the first black ink slowly
appears. The camera sits behind the
canvas, and Picasso's special ink
bleeds through instantly. The ink
ends up forming part of a man — an
artist, sitting on the ground, hunched
forward and painting. In the back
ground lies a prone nude woman.
The painting begins with simple
detail which develops steadily, but is
subsequently blotted out by sweeps of
black; the sketch seems much more
primitive when it's finished, and it
sets the tone for the rest of the paint
ings. (Picasso rarely gives us a clue
when he's approaching the end of a
painting, and Auric's musical accom
paniment follows his lead; often it
simply stops, with no drama or
fanfare.)
The first half of the movie is a se
ries of ink paintings, often starting
with a black ink sketch which is
quickly transformed by bursts of
color. Picasso may reverse our expec
tations by beginning a painting with a
bold streak of blue, following with
other colors and then filling in the ink
detail. And Auric's score fits the
mood of each painting; he supplies vi
brant percussion, wailing trumpets or
fanfare when Picasso does one of his
many bullfighting scenes.

The first half is an exhilarating les
son in the power of even the simplest
drawings, and after the first couple of
paintings, we begin to notice things
we weren't prepared to notice before;
Picasso plays little artistic games that
draw us into his technique.
The same characters appear from
painting to painting, perhaps in dif
ferent guises but often in the same
profile. Faces appear in snatches of
background. He paints a quick still
life of an eggplant on a platter, and
then does the same still-life but in
serts a brownish skull next to a blue
coffee pot and green onions.
Some sketches appear and disap
pear so quickly they're like visual
haiku — they stab at our subcon
scious with a sharp thrust. And when,
after an intricate, decorative montage

of patterns and faces, the camera is
suddenly lifted out of the camera
frame, it's like the punchline of an ex
tended joke. This isn't museum piece
art, to be hung on a wall; this is art
that moves, that springs to life on the
screen. It's like the best cartoon
animation you've ever seen.
A short interlude in the film gives
Picasso time to mix his paints and
Clouzot time to have a smoke. Even
Claude Renoir (grandson of Auguste,
and maybe the most versatile photog
rapher in the history of cinema —
he's worked on projects as diverse as
"La Grande Illusion" and"The Spy
Who Loved Me") gets his moment in
the sun; he leans from behind the
camera for a quizzical "Oui?" to a
question from Clouzot.
We sit behind Picasso for a quick

painting; it's quick because the film is
running out in the camera, and the
painting turns out to be a refreshing,
amusing divertissement (we get to fol
low the movements of his hand here,
and they're so expressive they leave
us wishing for more). After some
inks, however, Picasso wants to do
something with more depth, and
Henri suggests moving to oils, which
he can film with stop-motion shots of
the stages of the painting. It's with the
oils that Picasso really unleashes his
talent, and the movie rockets into the
creative stratosphere.
One painting goes from a simple
skull to a practically three
dimensional goat's head in about five
minutes. In another we see a prone
nude woman who goes through
various expressions while reading a

book; the painting culminates in a
cubist gaze of perfect ennui. A scene
of a bullfighter draped over a bull
gets two variations in oil, one with
deep earth browns and reds that are
utterly astounding.
And when Picasso ends with an
ever-changing fresco that goes on and
on, and then pauses to assess what
he's done, he notes that he's finally
getting to "the surprising truth at the
bottom of the well," and we can't
help but believe him. After a few
more strokes he stands back and says,
"This is bad. This is very, very bad."
In this film, Picasso is a master of
both the grand gesture and the per
fect, self-deflating barb. He gives a
hell of a performance, and at the end
of it, he signs his name to the film
with a fluorish.

Everything Picasso created in this film was burned at the end of shooting so that it exists nowhere except on film. A typically impetuous Pkasso thing to do, one thinks, until one sees the magnificent film itself.
Cinema purists might have prob
lems with "The Mystery of Picasso"
("Le Mystere Picasso"), but the rest
of us needn't worry about them.
There were once critical factions
that looked down on movies which
"borrowed"' material from other
sources; they felt that movies should
be a "pure" art form, without any re
lationship to the other arts. Today it's
pretty clear that such a restrictive def
inition would exclude some very en
joyable, even great, films.
Think of all the adaptations of
novels ("The Makioka Sisters," "A
Room with a View") and plays
("Come Back to the Five and Dime,
Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean," Olivier's
"Othello") and even concerts ("Stop
Making Sense") that have made won
derful films and you understand the
blurred boundaries of what might be
considered truly "cinematic." No
other art form encompasses all the
arts in the way film can — yet even
today, film critics don't seem entirely
comfortable discussing movies
adapted from other mediums.
At least, that's the only possible
reason I can come up with for the
ridiculously Jukewarm reception Bay
Area reviewers have given to "The
Mystery of Picasso," filmed in 1955
but only now going into widespread
general release. Part of the problem
may be that this film truly is a special
case, both in its subject and in its way
of presenting him.
The subject is, of course, Pablo
Picasso, and for the 85-minute dura
tion of this film we watch him
produce 15 paintings on a series of
canvasses which take the shape of the
movie screen. The paintings appear,
line by line, stroke by stroke, as if by
magic — both they and Picasso's
technique itself probably require an
art critic to do them full justice, but it
doesn't take a critic to know that,
while watching this movie, we're in
the presence of an awe-inspiring tal
ent.
"The Mystery of Picasso" doesn't
have a lot of things we associate with
a great movie. There is virtually no
dialogue, and the little we hear
usually has nothing to do with what
we see happening on the screen. The
performers — filmmaker Henri-
Georges Clouzot, photographer
Claude Renoir and Picasso himself —
appear only a couple of times, for a
few minutes, and they all seem fairly
amused by the whole enterprise, as if
making this movie were just a few
hours of fun in their lives.
But the sly wit of these making-of
the-movie scenes is really rooted in
Picasso's paintings themselves, and
it's safe to assume that Clouzot, who
directed and wrote the brief passages
of dialogue, was inspired by his artist
friend.
The whole of this film is inspired;
you don't see many films that express
such sheer delight in the potential of

movies. There's a sense of discovery,
of doing something new and exciting,
that accompanies this film. When this
theme is made explicit — as it is in the
opening scenes of Picasso wandering
through his studio — the mood is
somewhat destroyed, and the film
threatens to become high-brow and
tony.
Clouzot himself narrates the early
scenes, and he asks things like how
much we would give to know what
Mozart was thinking when he wrote
"The Jupiter Symphony." He says
that by following the movements of
the painter's brushstroke, we can
penetrate his "mystery," and follow
the movements of his mind. (These

art, to be hung on a wall; this is art
that moves, that springs to life on the
screen. It's like the best cartoon
animation you've ever seen.
A short interlude in the film gives
Picasso time to mix his paints and
Clouzot time to have a smoke. Even
Claude Renoir (grandson of Auguste,
and maybe the most versatile photog
rapher in the history of cinema —
he's worked on projects as diverse as
"La Grande Illusion" and"The Spy
Who Loved Me") gets his moment in
the sun; he leans from behind the
camera for a quizzical "Oui?" to a
question from Clouzot.
We sit behind Picasso for a quick

painting; it's quick because the film is
running out in the camera, and the
painting turns out to be a refreshing,
amusing divertissement (we get to fol
low the movements of his hand here,
and they're so expressive they leave
us wishing for more). After some
inks, however, Picasso wants to do
something with more depth, and
Henri suggests moving to oils, which
he can film with stop-motion shots of
the stages of the painting. It's with the
oils that Picasso really unleashes his
talent, and the movie rockets into the
creative stratosphere.
One painting goes from a simple
skull to a practically three
dimensional goat's head in about five
minutes. In another we see a prone
nude woman who goes through
various expressions while reading a

book; the painting culminates in a
cubist gaze of perfect ennui. A scene
of a bullfighter draped over a bull
gets two variations in oil, one with
deep earth browns and reds that are
utterly astounding.
And when Picasso ends with an
ever-changing fresco that goes on and
on, and then pauses to assess what
he's done, he notes that he's finally
getting to "the surprising truth at the
bottom of the well," and we can't
help but believe him. After a few
more strokes he stands back and says,
"This is bad. This is very, very bad."
In this film, Picasso is a master of
both the grand gesture and the per
fect, self-deflating barb. He gives a
hell of a performance, and at the end
of it, he signs his name to the film
with a fluorish.

Everything Picasso created in this film was burned at the end of shooting so that it exists nowhere except on film. A typically impetuous Pkasso thing to do, one thinks, until one sees the magnificent film itself.
Cinema purists might have prob
lems with "The Mystery of Picasso"
("Le Mystere Picasso"), but the rest
of us needn't worry about them.
There were once critical factions
that looked down on movies which
"borrowed"' material from other
sources; they felt that movies should
be a "pure" art form, without any re
lationship to the other arts. Today it's
pretty clear that such a restrictive def
inition would exclude some very en
joyable, even great, films.
Think of all the adaptations of
novels ("The Makioka Sisters," "A
Room with a View") and plays
("Come Back to the Five and Dime,
Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean," Olivier's
"Othello") and even concerts ("Stop
Making Sense") that have made won
derful films and you understand the
blurred boundaries of what might be
considered truly "cinematic." No
other art form encompasses all the
arts in the way film can — yet even
today, film critics don't seem entirely
comfortable discussing movies
adapted from other mediums.
At least, that's the only possible
reason I can come up with for the
ridiculously Jukewarm reception Bay
Area reviewers have given to "The
Mystery of Picasso," filmed in 1955
but only now going into widespread
general release. Part of the problem
may be that this film truly is a special
case, both in its subject and in its way
of presenting him.
The subject is, of course, Pablo
Picasso, and for the 85-minute dura
tion of this film we watch him
produce 15 paintings on a series of
canvasses which take the shape of the
movie screen. The paintings appear,
line by line, stroke by stroke, as if by
magic — both they and Picasso's
technique itself probably require an
art critic to do them full justice, but it
doesn't take a critic to know that,
while watching this movie, we're in
the presence of an awe-inspiring tal
ent.
"The Mystery of Picasso" doesn't
have a lot of things we associate with
a great movie. There is virtually no
dialogue, and the little we hear
usually has nothing to do with what
we see happening on the screen. The
performers — filmmaker Henri-
Georges Clouzot, photographer
Claude Renoir and Picasso himself —
appear only a couple of times, for a
few minutes, and they all seem fairly
amused by the whole enterprise, as if
making this movie were just a few
hours of fun in their lives.
But the sly wit of these making-of
the-movie scenes is really rooted in
Picasso's paintings themselves, and
it's safe to assume that Clouzot, who
directed and wrote the brief passages
of dialogue, was inspired by his artist
friend.
The whole of this film is inspired;
you don't see many films that express
such sheer delight in the potential of

movies. There's a sense of discovery,
of doing something new and exciting,
that accompanies this film. When this
theme is made explicit — as it is in the
opening scenes of Picasso wandering
through his studio — the mood is
somewhat destroyed, and the film
threatens to become high-brow and
tony.
Clouzot himself narrates the early
scenes, and he asks things like how
much we would give to know what
Mozart was thinking when he wrote
"The Jupiter Symphony." He says
that by following the movements of
the painter's brushstroke, we can
penetrate his "mystery," and follow
the movements of his mind. (These
passages, unfortunately, also give us a
bad first impression of Georges
Auric's score, which swells impor
tantly in the background.)
This narration sounds like perfect
nonsense, and so it is; but we aren't
really put off, because it's accompa
nied by scenes of Picasso standing
amidst huge Expressionist canvasses,
and the imagery is so expressive that
all our fears are allayed.
This movie doesn't explain the
mystery of Picasso, but do we really
want it to? The man we see in the
opening scenes is practically a work
of art himself — stripped bare to the
waist, with the barrel chest of a
wrestler, a bald, smooth head and a
hawkish profile. He stands in his
studio and contemplates his paintings
as if he, too, can't explain them — as
if he's just seen something in them he
hadn't seen before, something which
he can't quite figure out.
The first painting appears in abso
lute silence; the camera cuts from the
darkness of the studio to the blank
canvas, and the first black ink slowly
appears. The camera sits behind the
canvas, and Picasso's special ink
bleeds through instantly. The ink
ends up forming part of a man — an
artist, sitting on the ground, hunched
forward and painting. In the back
ground lies a prone nude woman.
The painting begins with simple
detail which develops steadily, but is
subsequently blotted out by sweeps of
black; the sketch seems much more
primitive when it's finished, and it
sets the tone for the rest of the paint
ings. (Picasso rarely gives us a clue
when he's approaching the end of a
painting, and Auric's musical accom
paniment follows his lead; often it
simply stops, with no drama or
fanfare.)
The first half of the movie is a se
ries of ink paintings, often starting
with a black ink sketch which is
quickly transformed by bursts of
color. Picasso may reverse our expec
tations by beginning a painting with a
bold streak of blue, following with
other colors and then filling in the ink
detail. And Auric's score fits the
mood of each painting; he supplies vi
brant percussion, wailing trumpets or
fanfare when Picasso does one of his
many bullfighting scenes.

The first half is an exhilarating les
son in the power of even the simplest
drawings, and after the first couple of
paintings, we begin to notice things
we weren't prepared to notice before;
Picasso plays little artistic games that
draw us into his technique.
The same characters appear from
painting to painting, perhaps in dif
ferent guises but often in the same
profile. Faces appear in snatches of
background. He paints a quick still
life of an eggplant on a platter, and
then does the same still-life but in
serts a brownish skull next to a blue
coffee pot and green onions.
Some sketches appear and disap
pear so quickly they're like visual
haiku — they stab at our subcon
scious with a sharp thrust. And when,
after an intricate, decorative montage

of patterns and faces, the camera is
suddenly lifted out of the camera
frame, it's like the punchline of an ex
tended joke. This isn't museum piece
art, to be hung on a wall; this is art
that moves, that springs to life on the
screen. It's like the best cartoon
animation you've ever seen.
A short interlude in the film gives
