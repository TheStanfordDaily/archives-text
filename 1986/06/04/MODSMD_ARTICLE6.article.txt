# Sexism persists on Farm
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Senior staff writer 
At age 14. Zoo Sutton, a Santa Ana native,
walked briskly through an alley behind her
house. A man stopped her.
"He pushed me forcibly against the wall and
started feeling me over." Sutton, a senior here
now. recalls. "I was scared for mv life."
Sutton tried to talk to the man."I didn't want
to scream" or antagonize him. she said. Eventu
ally he let her go. Sutton's parents filed a police
report, but the assailant was never caught.
Mention sexual harassment at Stanford and
many people — students, faculty and adminis
trators. men and women alike — clam up.
It's not that the problem doesn't exist. Four
undergraduates and three laculty and stall
members issued complaints to the omsbudsper
son's office last year. One victim reported a
sexual assault to police this year. And women
continue to tell friends of numerous less serious
unreported incidents.
Nor is it that no one cares. Enrollment figures

in self-do fen so classes are snowballing this year.
Three times as many students want to take the
SWOPSI sponsored classes than can he accom
modated each quarter, according to junior Judy
David.
Simply, the issue is at once sensitive and
volatile. Both experts and victims here speak
honestly but measurcdly about sexism and har
assment. Many women say they don't want to
sound anti-male; several men fear being too
moralistic.
In her sixth week as a freshman here last year,
Charlotte I.owson was attacked by a drunk
sophomore at a fraternity party on campus
Lowson pressed charges against the student
who grabbed her arms and pulled at her jacket
and blouse. I.owson says she has mixed'feelings
about reporting the incident All the "publicity
and flack (and) hate" suddenly being thrown at
her made some ol her nights sleepless.
But she says that more than eight Stanford
women came up to her soon after the assault
supporting her and telling her that similai inci
dents had happened to them or their friends.
I.owson sa\s. however, that she sometimes
still feels guilty now about what "I
was doing" to her student-attacker
by turning him in to the police. He
eventually pleaded guilty to two
counts of battery and was
suspended from the University for
one quarter.
The number of reported rapes
and assaults on campus has
decreased over the past five years,
according to Stanford police statis
tics. In 1981 reports show four
rapes and four assaults; no rapes
and one assault have been re
ported so far this year.
But the actual number of rapes
and assaults may be higher than
police statistics indicate. Many are
acquaintance rapes and most go
unreported, according to an in
formational booklet published by
the Rape Education Project
(REP).
Rape victims fear they will be
ridiculed and that people won't
believe them, says David, coordin
ator of the REP. "Sometimes they
think they're crazy" if the attacker
was an acquaintance or boyfriend.
And feelings of guilt and the legal
process are "churning," David
says.
People tend to think "it's prob
ably your fault" if the alleged at
tacker is "from your class and your
race," says Patricia Polhemus, as
sistant dean of Residential Educa
tion and director of graduate
residences.
REP is a student-run educa
tional outreach group under the
direction of Alice Supton. assis
tant dean of Residential Educa
tion.
The most common kind of
sexual harassment is the hardest
kind to stop, Polhemus says. It
typically occurs "between well
meaning people. . . when it's not
appropriate for them to get in
volved and they do — and it goes
badly."
Its form is often subtle and so
phisticated.
"I don't think people go around
saying "Hey, baby, f— me and I'll
give you an 'A', " Polhemus/says.
Instead, Polhemus says, some
one might ask "if you want to go
to a conference, and I'll have the
University pay your way."
Sexual harassment takes other
forms, as well. Obscene phone
calls and derogatory verbal com
ments are among the most com
mon forms it takes here, some
women report.
Several undergraduate women
feel ambivalent about speaking
out against sexist attitudes.

On the one hand, David and
other Stanford women say they
feel sad, angry and frustrated
when they think people are not
treating them equally because they
are women and when students are
unwilling to discuss sexism. On the
other hand, they say they've
learned that confrontations can be
devisive.
"It often drives you apart"
when a woman challenges a man
on these issues, Polhemus says.
"It might not be worth it to me
to tell you not to call me 'girl',"
says Polhemus, who has fought
against war, racism and sexism
since high school. On second
thought, though, she says smiling,
"well, it might be."
"People don't want to be
separated from each other," she
adds. "They want to be close. ...
It's tricky because the people you
love are the people who need to be
educated about these very hard is
sues."
David qualifies any criticism of
male sexist attitudes here by
stating that "in a lot of ways men
at Stanford do treat women as
equal." But David says that she
has seen sexism in "so many dif
ferent forms."
Offenses range from the way
students decorate their walls "with
calendars and pinups of women in
skimpy bikinis with beers" to the
way men dominate political sci
ence discussion sections, she says.
David says that while she and
others at REP and elsewhere at
the University hold some feminist
attitudes, many are reluctant to
label themselves as feminists. "A
lot of people hold a distorted view
of feminism as male-hating ideol
ogy," she says."And it really
isn't."
"It takes men and women
working together. . . . People im
agine the anti-male lesbian, and
there are people like that," she
says. But, in balance "there are
people who really like men."
The feminist and other move
ments against sexism have lost
momentum in recent years, some
officials say. Undergraduate Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons
says he has noted an increased
tolerance for sexist attitudes over
the past quarter of a century.
One woman, at least, believes
that what some are calling in
creased tolerance of sexism is tem
porary. Some women who were
active fighters of sexual discrimi
nation in the 1960s and '70s took
time out to bear and raise
children, Polhemus said. But, in
searching for "intimacy, caring
and survival," Polhemus believes
men and women are again becom
ing interested in issues of equality.
