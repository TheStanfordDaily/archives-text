At age 14. Zoo Sutton, a Santa Ana native,
walked briskly through an alley behind her
house. A man stopped her.

Charlotte I.owson was attacked by a drunk
sophomore at a fraternity party on campus
Lowson pressed charges against the student
who grabbed her arms and pulled at her jacket
and blouse. I.owson says she has mixed'feelings
about reporting the incident All the "publicity
and flack (and) hate" suddenly being thrown at
her made some ol her nights sleepless.
But she says that more than eight Stanford
women came up to her soon after the assault
supporting her and telling her that similai inci
dents had happened to them or their friends.
I.owson sa\s. however, that she sometimes
