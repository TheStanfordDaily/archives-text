# TALES OF COUNCIL OF PRESIDENTS
## 
### 

Tales are told of a mysterious fou some, a band of nomads that attempted the
impossible. Legends abound, but the *ruth is something else. Some say they never
really were, others that their achievements were few. But know you this: exist they
did. The dined with luminaries and grappled with clowns. And they lost. And
therein lies a story . . .


The CO Pear.
It doesn't drive. It doesn't fly. It doesn't shoot stun-glue from its fenders. It
parks. And it levitated this young boy for well over a second after he
propelled himself off the ground with his feet.


Professor Why
The binding force, guiding light, and magical mentor of the Council of Presidents,
Professor Why is recognized the world over as the creator of the Super Hero Coun
cil. As well as constantly refining the finely-tuned abilities of his disciples, the Pro
fessor is ever on the lookout for new and better ways of fighting crime, righting
wrongs, and remembering his address. At a recent meeting in the Palace of Power,
he announced his newest and arguably most frightening weapon against evil: Pro
fessor Why's Terrifying 'Chamber of Commerce.' "It's a shocker" he said. "All the
horror of local politics in one bone-jarring building." Let bad men tremble.


Duke Tim
Timothy Tim, the dashing billionaire darling of high society who claimed at one
point in his life that he had "... never earned a penny of my money, nor stolen a
penny either," was the inscrutable but affable backbone of the Council. Magical
'parking cars,' Tard-Destructo Hammers, and constant Bail-Bonds don't come
cheap, and it was Timothy's patented "bottomless pocket" that made the 'Four on
the Floor' a band of somewhat interesting crime-fighters and not merely a bunch of
aimless miscreants. It was the dashing Duke who bought Professor Why his famed
Electric Thinking and Drinking Cap, Little Leland her Wonder Dog, and She-Man
his haircut. The Duke shunned publicity and was at all times reluctant to discuss his
past, which was described by the few persons with any inkling of it as being
"shadier than a Jimmy Hoffa vacation package and more mysterious than a cigar
smoking nun at the Teamsters annual picnic." Quirk laughs off allegations of con
nections with organized crime. "Organized?" he smiles. "I think you must have a
wrong number. This is the ASSU."


Captain Coffin
At a party at the Kennedy's a few years ago the Captain arrived late, delayed by a
stinging bout of rain and the consistant immobility of the COPcar. "New guests
have arrived," announced the doorman, hastening him inside. "Allow me to intro
duce two of his own favorite people: Captain Coffin, and his ego." The Captain
grinned, and the two of them mingled. Coffin had a few drinks and spent the better
part of the evening discussing the politics of heroism with the chauffer. Bashful
Tom; his ego danced, told a few off-color jokes to the President's wife, and left with
a woman in a chiffon dress. "They're my two best friends" Duke Tim related in a
rare thoughtful moment. "Good people, and Super Heroes." The Captain himself
was good-natured and philosophical about it all. "It's not like my friends and I hang
around the office at night, taking pictures of ourselves and inventing heroic tales
about each other until all hours of the night. No," he winks, "its not like that at all."
A golden halo of light surrounded him in dazzling brilliance as a host of nubile
cherubim began to prance and cavort about him as the party wore on into the
night.


Bashful Tom
Bashful Tom was a lady's man; first and foremost, however, he was the oh-so
proper chauffer of the magical COPcar. "I hesitate to call the COPcar simply an au
tomobile" he related once to an associate over cordials at the Palace of Power, the
Council's renowned hideaway. "How many times did we break onto the road with
the moon to light our way, following only the hood ornament?" A rare grin and the
slightest raising of an eyebrow are his only answer. His face then darkens. "Well,
not too many times. 1 mean, the car didn't really run per se. it just sort of sal there in
the driveway, but damned if it didn't look good. We used to just sort of sit in it and
make noises like a moving car. Brrrrm! Brkkkkmm! Vrooom! That was really
living." A look of contented satisfaction plays across his face as he pulls on his leat
her gloves, warm and brown and never used. "They're a pretty neat bunch, consid
ering that they're Super Heroes and all that. Professor Why, he's one of my favorites
— he once made me an omlette out of a hubcap." Is the magic of these mystics en
tirely unbridled.



Little Leland and the Wonder Dog
A woman among men, Little Leland was once asked if she would describe
herself as a mellowing influence on her penis-bearing compatriots.
"They're a bunch of pansy-ass wimps" she said in reply, calmly crushing a
six-pack of bottled beer between her able hands. An intriuging combina
tion of beauty and brawn that riles and beguiles alike. Leland is seldom
seen without her four-legged familiar, Kesey the Wonder Dog. Indeed,
Kesey the Wonder Dog is associated so wholly and completely with Little
Leland that some people have taken to speaking to the dog instead —
"Why Hello, Kesey!" Friends of Leland's can be heard to say on any given
day, "Where's Leland? Huh? What's that? She wants me to buy you a
handful of beef chewies and a box of animal crackers? Well, alright, if she
said so!" And you wanted to know why we called her a wonder dog.


The Master of Andi-matter. The powers of this powerful but hopelessly confused
hero are wonderous to behold. She-Man has mastered feats of physical daring
beyond the scope of mere mortals, up to and including falling out of second-story
windows, chewing the tops off of beer bottles, scaring the shit out of people who
wonder at She-Man's frightening curly-mohawked visage, and remaining in
school.


But that was long ago. Where they are now is as much a mystery as where they
were before they came. Holed up in some hovel writing stories about themselves,
perhaps. All that remains is the memory, and a few stains on the carpet where they
spilled some beer. And hope. Hope that, if they can't return, there are forty people
out there with some perspective, and better things to do on Tuesday nights from
7:00-10:00 p.m., and a taste for beer and glory.

impossible. Legends abound, but the *ruth is something else. Some say they never

Tales are told of a mysterious fou some, a band of nomads that attempted the
impossible. Legends abound, but the *ruth is something else. Some say they never
really were, others that their achievements were few. But know you this: exist they
did. The dined with luminaries and grappled with clowns. And they lost. And
therein lies a story . . .


The CO Pear.
It doesn't drive. It doesn't fly. It doesn't shoot stun-glue from its fenders. It
parks. And it levitated this young boy for well over a second after he
propelled himself off the ground with his feet.


Professor Why
The binding force, guiding light, and magical mentor of the Council of Presidents,
Professor Why is recognized the world over as the creator of the Super Hero Coun
cil. As well as constantly refining the finely-tuned abilities of his disciples, the Pro
fessor is ever on the lookout for new and better ways of fighting crime, righting
wrongs, and remembering his address. At a recent meeting in the Palace of Power,
he announced his newest and arguably most frightening weapon against evil: Pro
fessor Why's Terrifying 'Chamber of Commerce.' "It's a shocker" he said. "All the
horror of local politics in one bone-jarring building." Let bad men tremble.


Duke Tim
Timothy Tim, the dashing billionaire darling of high society who claimed at one
point in his life that he had "... never earned a penny of my money, nor stolen a
penny either," was the inscrutable but affable backbone of the Council. Magical
'parking cars,' Tard-Destructo Hammers, and constant Bail-Bonds don't come
cheap, and it was Timothy's patented "bottomless pocket" that made the 'Four on
the Floor' a band of somewhat interesting crime-fighters and not merely a bunch of
aimless miscreants. It was the dashing Duke who bought Professor Why his famed
Electric Thinking and Drinking Cap, Little Leland her Wonder Dog, and She-Man
his haircut. The Duke shunned publicity and was at all times reluctant to discuss his
past, which was described by the few persons with any inkling of it as being
"shadier than a Jimmy Hoffa vacation package and more mysterious than a cigar
smoking nun at the Teamsters annual picnic." Quirk laughs off allegations of con
nections with organized crime. "Organized?" he smiles. "I think you must have a
wrong number. This is the ASSU."


Captain Coffin
At a party at the Kennedy's a few years ago the Captain arrived late, delayed by a
stinging bout of rain and the consistant immobility of the COPcar. "New guests
have arrived," announced the doorman, hastening him inside. "Allow me to intro
duce two of his own favorite people: Captain Coffin, and his ego." The Captain
grinned, and the two of them mingled. Coffin had a few drinks and spent the better
part of the evening discussing the politics of heroism with the chauffer. Bashful
Tom; his ego danced, told a few off-color jokes to the President's wife, and left with
a woman in a chiffon dress. "They're my two best friends" Duke Tim related in a
rare thoughtful moment. "Good people, and Super Heroes." The Captain himself
was good-natured and philosophical about it all. "It's not like my friends and I hang
around the office at night, taking pictures of ourselves and inventing heroic tales
about each other until all hours of the night. No," he winks, "its not like that at all."
A golden halo of light surrounded him in dazzling brilliance as a host of nubile
cherubim began to prance and cavort about him as the party wore on into the
night.


Bashful Tom
Bashful Tom was a lady's man; first and foremost, however, he was the oh-so
proper chauffer of the magical COPcar. "I hesitate to call the COPcar simply an au
tomobile" he related once to an associate over cordials at the Palace of Power, the
Council's renowned hideaway. "How many times did we break onto the road with
the moon to light our way, following only the hood ornament?" A rare grin and the
slightest raising of an eyebrow are his only answer. His face then darkens. "Well,
not too many times. 1 mean, the car didn't really run per se. it just sort of sal there in
the driveway, but damned if it didn't look good. We used to just sort of sit in it and
make noises like a moving car. Brrrrm! Brkkkkmm! Vrooom! That was really
living." A look of contented satisfaction plays across his face as he pulls on his leat
her gloves, warm and brown and never used. "They're a pretty neat bunch, consid
ering that they're Super Heroes and all that. Professor Why, he's one of my favorites
— he once made me an omlette out of a hubcap." Is the magic of these mystics en
tirely unbridled.



Little Leland and the Wonder Dog
A woman among men, Little Leland was once asked if she would describe
herself as a mellowing influence on her penis-bearing compatriots.
"They're a bunch of pansy-ass wimps" she said in reply, calmly crushing a
six-pack of bottled beer between her able hands. An intriuging combina
tion of beauty and brawn that riles and beguiles alike. Leland is seldom
seen without her four-legged familiar, Kesey the Wonder Dog. Indeed,
Kesey the Wonder Dog is associated so wholly and completely with Little
Leland that some people have taken to speaking to the dog instead —
"Why Hello, Kesey!" Friends of Leland's can be heard to say on any given
day, "Where's Leland? Huh? What's that? She wants me to buy you a
handful of beef chewies and a box of animal crackers? Well, alright, if she
said so!" And you wanted to know why we called her a wonder dog.


The Master of Andi-matter. The powers of this powerful but hopelessly confused
hero are wonderous to behold. She-Man has mastered feats of physical daring
beyond the scope of mere mortals, up to and including falling out of second-story
windows, chewing the tops off of beer bottles, scaring the shit out of people who
wonder at She-Man's frightening curly-mohawked visage, and remaining in
school.


But that was long ago. Where they are now is as much a mystery as where they
were before they came. Holed up in some hovel writing stories about themselves,
perhaps. All that remains is the memory, and a few stains on the carpet where they
spilled some beer. And hope. Hope that, if they can't return, there are forty people
out there with some perspective, and better things to do on Tuesday nights from
7:00-10:00 p.m., and a taste for beer and glory.
