# Three profs. to talk at Class Day
## 
### 
What do Biology Prof. Craig Hel
ler, Professor of English Nancy
Packer and Gerry Talley, a lecturer in
sociology, have in common?
Well, for starters, all three will be
speaking at a luncheon for seniors
and their parents Saturday behind the
Bowman Alumni House.
And each member of the trio —
two of whom have won awards for
teaching excellence — has also been
described, at one time or another, as
"tough but fair."
Heller, who received his bachelor's
degree in biology at Ursinus College
in Pennsylvania in 1968, holds two
advanced degrees from Yale. He
received his master's in biology there
in 1968 and his doctorate in 1970.
In 1972 Heller came to Stanford as
an assistant professor of biology, and
filled in the gap left when Donald
Kennedy took a post with the Food
and Drug Administration in Wash
ington, D.C.
In 1977, Heller won the Walter J.
Gores Faculty Achievement Award,
given annually "in recognition of ex
cellence in teaching in its broadest
sense."
"It's no use starting a course off as
'Mr. Nice Guy' and then trying to
impose a different pattern as time
goes on," he says.
Heller's large lecture course, Biol
ogy 022 — which routinely has an en

rollment of nearly 500 students —
consistently wins rave reviews on stu
dent evaluations.
Heller is also active in the Faculty
Senate, where he served as chairman
two years ago.
English Prof. Nancy Packer is also
the recipient of an award for teaching
excellence. Last year she won the
Dean's Award for Teaching, a prize
given annually by the Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
Packer, like Heller, has a reputa

tion as a hard but fair instructor.
"I try to be demanding and I think
I ain demanding," Packer says. Her
course on the history and develop
ment of the short story, English 137,
is one of the most popular courses in
the English Department.
Nevertheless, Packer maintains
that she "fell into" her job as a
teacher.
"I didn't choose teaching. ... I of
ten think my career is a matter of
leaning against a door and somebody

accidentally unlatched it and I fell
in."
Packer is also the author of a book
of short stories, "Small Moments,"
and several of her stories have ap
peared magazines such as Harper's
and the Georgia Review.
Talley has been a lecturer in the
Sociology Deopartment for the past
few years, and has won "amazing
popularity with the students," ac
cording to a colleague. "The kids just
love him."
