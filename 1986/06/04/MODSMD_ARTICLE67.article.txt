"The only thing I remember is that
I was wearing a pair of Bermuda
shorts and nothing else under my cap
and gown."
After six years at the helm of one
of broadcast jcurnalism's most ac
claimed productions, "Nightline"
anchorman Ted Koppel — the
epitome of the unflappable newsman
who nonetheless admits to only a
vague recollection of his own com
mencement speaker — will put his
celebrated powers of communication
to the ultimate test as the principal
speaker at Stanford's 95th Com
mencement.
A Stanford graduate, Koppel ac
cepted a written invitation from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy on
Feb. 24, saying he could imagine no
greater honor than speaking to Stan
ford students.
"The thought of compelling some
of my old professors to listen to me in
silent and (at least the appearance of)
rapt attention is . . . almost enough in
itself, Koppel wrote Kennedy.
In a March interview with The
Daily, Koppel said Stanford was a
"phenomenal university," adding
that he was "glad 1 got in before they
raised the standards."
On a May 27 "Nightline" show
focusing on commencement speakers
and speeches, Koppel said he never
"exactly" knows what institutions
want from him as a graduation
speaker.
Although he told The Daily he was
"not going to give a speech I've
already written," Koppel hinted to
"Nightline" viewers that his speech
would be somewhat in the traditional
mode.
"If I had Bill Cosby's sense of
humor, I would do exactly what he
does, and that is to keep it as light as
you possibly can," he said. "For those
of us who don't have any particular
skill, I think the universal values are
probably the safest ones to adhere
to."
Koppel reflected humorously
about the circumstances surrounding
his selection as speaker. "I'm kind of
everybody's second or third choice,"
he said. "When they can't get the
really top-flight speakers, they come

to me."
"In the case of Columbia Law
School, for example, Anatoli
Shcharansky couldn't make it. In the
case of Stanford University, (Soviet
leader Mikhail) Gorbachev and a fel
low by the name of Cosby couldn't
make it."
In February, the four Stanford
senior class presidents invited Gorba
chev to speak at Commencement,
hopefully in conjunction with a pro
posed Reagan-Gorbachev summit in
June.
A cover letter from Kennedy
seemed to endorse the invitation, but
a University spokesman later said
Gorbachev had only been issued an
"open invitation" and had not been
invited to speak at Commencement.
Only days later, the class presidents
asked Kennedy to invite Cosby, but
the comedian-turned-television star,
one of the hottest speakers on this
year's graduation circuit, refused to
speak when Stanford declined to
grant him an honorary doctorate.
Stanford traditionally does not grant
honorary degrees.
In a curious spectacle on the com
mencement "Nightline," whose parti
cipants included Cosby and also con
servative columnist William F. Buck
ley, Koppel scoffed at the notion that
honorary degrees were a legitimate
means of encouraging graduation
speakers.
"In fact, I'm reminded of what
H.L. Mencken said about the confer
ring of honorary degrees, which
usually goes with the glory of a com
mencement speech — Honorary
degrees are a university's way of cer
tifying a pompous ass.' "
Koppel was born in 1940 in Lan
cashire, England, the only child of af
fluent German Jewish parents who
fled the Nazis. At 13, he moved with
his family to New York, where he ex
celled in boarding school.
An admirer of famed radio
newsman Edward R. Murrow, Kop
pel entered Syracuse University and
majored in speech. Following
graduate study at Stanford's Commu
nication Department, he joined ABC
News in 1963, becoming the youngest
network correspondent at that time.
Because ABC was then considered
a virtual also-ran in the network news
battles, Koppel was privy to more
desirable career stops than he might
have received elsewhere.
As Hong Kong bureau chief, he
covered the Vietnam War, develop

ing an interest in Asia. Koppel
returned to the States to cover the
State Department at the same time
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
engaged in Middle-East "shuttle
diplomacy."
In 1976, Koppel shook the broad
cast world by foregoing his diplomatic
beat to become a house husband,
caring for his son and three daughters
while his wife, Stanford graduate
Grace Ann Dorney, began law
school.
While on leave from ABC, he flew
to New York once a week to anchor
the network's Saturday evening news
broadcast and co-wrote a
diplomatic intrigue bestseller, "In
the National Interest," with current
NBC diplomatic correspondent Mar
vin Kalb.
In 1980, Koppel was propelled into
stardom when he replaced Frank
Reynolds as host of an 11:30 p.m.
ABC News show, "The Iran Crisis:
America Held Hostage," the precur
sor of today's "Nightline."

Originally focusing on coverage of
the Iranian hostage crisis, the show
and its host quickly became a fixture
on late-night television, drawing
raves from critics and high ratings
from the public.
As viewership expanded to more
than 5 million, Koppel became so
enamored with the journalistic possi
bilities of the show that he declined a
1983 offer to leave the show and
become anchor of ABC's "World
News Tonight."
Known as a conservative in a
liberal-dominated trade, Koppel is
praised as a tough but fair-minded
and even-handed journalist.
Off-camera, Koppel enjoys an oc
casional set of post-midnight tennis
and is known for his quick wit and his
impersonations of political figures he
has covered.
During a guest spot on "Late Night
with David Letterman," the multi
talented Koppel impersonated Rich
ard Nixon and William Buckley and
balanced a dog biscuit on his nose.

ABC "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel, a Stanford graduate, returns to
the Farm this weekend as the keynote speaker at Stanford's 95th Com
mencement.
The commanding voice. The acer
bic wit. A reporter s instincts. The
hair.
The hair.
"The only thing I remember is that
I was wearing a pair of Bermuda
shorts and nothing else under my cap
and gown."
After six years at the helm of one
of broadcast jcurnalism's most ac
claimed productions, "Nightline"
anchorman Ted Koppel — the
epitome of the unflappable newsman
who nonetheless admits to only a
vague recollection of his own com
mencement speaker — will put his
celebrated powers of communication
to the ultimate test as the principal
speaker at Stanford's 95th Com
mencement.
A Stanford graduate, Koppel ac
cepted a written invitation from Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy on
Feb. 24, saying he could imagine no
greater honor than speaking to Stan
ford students.
"The thought of compelling some
of my old professors to listen to me in
silent and (at least the appearance of)
rapt attention is . . . almost enough in
itself, Koppel wrote Kennedy.
In a March interview with The
Daily, Koppel said Stanford was a
"phenomenal university," adding
that he was "glad 1 got in before they
raised the standards."
On a May 27 "Nightline" show
focusing on commencement speakers
and speeches, Koppel said he never
"exactly" knows what institutions
want from him as a graduation
speaker.
Although he told The Daily he was
"not going to give a speech I've
already written," Koppel hinted to
"Nightline" viewers that his speech
would be somewhat in the traditional
mode.
"If I had Bill Cosby's sense of
humor, I would do exactly what he
does, and that is to keep it as light as
you possibly can," he said. "For those
of us who don't have any particular
skill, I think the universal values are
probably the safest ones to adhere
to."
Koppel reflected humorously
about the circumstances surrounding
his selection as speaker. "I'm kind of
everybody's second or third choice,"
he said. "When they can't get the
really top-flight speakers, they come

to me."
"In the case of Columbia Law
School, for example, Anatoli
Shcharansky couldn't make it. In the
case of Stanford University, (Soviet
leader Mikhail) Gorbachev and a fel
low by the name of Cosby couldn't
make it."
In February, the four Stanford
senior class presidents invited Gorba
chev to speak at Commencement,
hopefully in conjunction with a pro
posed Reagan-Gorbachev summit in
June.
A cover letter from Kennedy
seemed to endorse the invitation, but
a University spokesman later said
Gorbachev had only been issued an
"open invitation" and had not been
invited to speak at Commencement.
Only days later, the class presidents
asked Kennedy to invite Cosby, but
the comedian-turned-television star,
one of the hottest speakers on this
year's graduation circuit, refused to
speak when Stanford declined to
grant him an honorary doctorate.
Stanford traditionally does not grant
honorary degrees.
In a curious spectacle on the com
mencement "Nightline," whose parti
cipants included Cosby and also con
servative columnist William F. Buck
ley, Koppel scoffed at the notion that
honorary degrees were a legitimate
means of encouraging graduation
speakers.
"In fact, I'm reminded of what
H.L. Mencken said about the confer
ring of honorary degrees, which
usually goes with the glory of a com
mencement speech — Honorary
degrees are a university's way of cer
tifying a pompous ass.' "
Koppel was born in 1940 in Lan
cashire, England, the only child of af
fluent German Jewish parents who
fled the Nazis. At 13, he moved with
his family to New York, where he ex
celled in boarding school.
An admirer of famed radio
newsman Edward R. Murrow, Kop
pel entered Syracuse University and
majored in speech. Following
graduate study at Stanford's Commu
nication Department, he joined ABC
News in 1963, becoming the youngest
network correspondent at that time.
Because ABC was then considered
a virtual also-ran in the network news
battles, Koppel was privy to more
desirable career stops than he might
have received elsewhere.
As Hong Kong bureau chief, he
covered the Vietnam War, develop

ing an interest in Asia. Koppel
returned to the States to cover the
State Department at the same time
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
engaged in Middle-East "shuttle
diplomacy."
In 1976, Koppel shook the broad
cast world by foregoing his diplomatic
beat to become a house husband,
caring for his son and three daughters
while his wife, Stanford graduate
Grace Ann Dorney, began law
school.
While on leave from ABC, he flew
to New York once a week to anchor
the network's Saturday evening news
broadcast and co-wrote a
diplomatic intrigue bestseller, "In
the National Interest," with current
NBC diplomatic correspondent Mar
vin Kalb.
In 1980, Koppel was propelled into
stardom when he replaced Frank
Reynolds as host of an 11:30 p.m.
ABC News show, "The Iran Crisis:
America Held Hostage," the precur
sor of today's "Nightline."

Originally focusing on coverage of
the Iranian hostage crisis, the show
and its host quickly became a fixture
on late-night television, drawing
raves from critics and high ratings
from the public.
As viewership expanded to more
than 5 million, Koppel became so
enamored with the journalistic possi
bilities of the show that he declined a
1983 offer to leave the show and
become anchor of ABC's "World
News Tonight."
Known as a conservative in a
liberal-dominated trade, Koppel is
praised as a tough but fair-minded
and even-handed journalist.
Off-camera, Koppel enjoys an oc
casional set of post-midnight tennis
and is known for his quick wit and his
impersonations of political figures he
