# Students plan demonstration
## Target Sunday's ceremony 
### MICHAEL NEWMAN Editorial staff 
Calling University investment
policy "racist" and raising ques
tions about the "legitimacy" of
their education, several seniors
said Thursday that they plan to
stage a protest during Stanford's
95th Commencement exercises
Sunday.
Organizers of the protest were
busy much of Thursday handing
out flyers urging students to carry
black balloons "signifying (the)
racist practices of the University"
into Stanford Stadium and release
them just as University President
Donald Kennedy approaches the
podium.
Asking students to "join the
struggle for justice," the flyers
criticize Stanford's investments in
companies that do business with
South Africa and the University's
Western Culture program, which
"promotes racism, sexism and na
tional chauvinism by its systematic
exclusion of the contributions of
people of color, women and
working people."
The flyer also urges students to
wear a red sash to Commence
ment exercises as a sign of
solidarity with "the youth of
Soweto."
"We're doing this to demon
strate our abhorrence of apart
heid," explained senior Robby
Perkins, one of the organizers of
the event. Perkins also said that
the students involved are acting
"more as individuals than a
group," although he noted that
several of the organizers were
members of Stanford Out of South
Africa, the Black Student Union
and MeCHA, a Chicano student
association.
Senior Stacey Leyton, another
organizer, said "at least 1,000"

students participated in the
protests last year and that "about
the same" number are expected to
protest on Sunday.
"This protest will be symbolic,"
Leyton explained.
In fact, "a lot of people like
wearing [the red sashes]," Leyton
claimed. Leyton also stressed that
organizers "aren't planning any
disruptions" to the ceremony.
However, at least one senior ex
pressed concern that Commence
ment exercises would be marred
by a show of "incredibly poor
taste."
"I don't get very many special
days in my life, and this is one of
them," he said, calling the tactics
of the protesters "cheap and
easy."
But organizers were quick to
point out that the demonstration is
meant to be constructive, not
destructive.
"The bottom line is that we
want to demonstrate against [some
of the University's policies], not
simply say that we're against
them," Perkins said. "I compare
my day to a day in the life of an
apartheid victim and I don't worry
about my day being ruined."
According to Leyton, about 15
or 20 students are involved in the
planning of the protest. Volun
teers will begin arriving at the
Stadium at 5 a.m. Sunday to blow
up the balloons, she said.
In addition to the protest at
Commencement exercises, Leyton
said that there would be "some
kind of presence" by the students
at the Baccalaureate Service on
Saturday morning and University
President Donald Kennedy's
reception for seniors and their
parents in the afternoon.
