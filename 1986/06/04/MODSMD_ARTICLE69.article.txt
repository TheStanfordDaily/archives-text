# It's that time of year
## Commencement advice from all over 
### 
Every year, during the months of May and
June, large groups of students wearing long
gowns and funny-looking caps file into sports
arenas or stadiums and sit patiently, often under
a sweltering sun, while another person —
usually an older person — gives them advice.
This is known as "commencement." Follow
ing is some advice students at other schools
across the United States have received in the
past few weeks.
California Chief Justice Rose Bird at the Univer
sity of California, Davis: You should concen
trate on what you are doing now, and if you do
it well, things that you want will happen in the
future. I think that no matter how much ma
terial success you may achieve, you pave the
way to disappointment if you set up your five
and ten-year goals and say to yourself, 'By then
I want to be there.' We are here, I believe, to
achieve wisdom and live ethically. And if we can
look upon the journey of life as a learning
process, we will begin to perceive a lot of the
difficult and disappointing things that happen
along the way in a very different light — and
perhaps grow from the experience, rather than
turn bitter. You really can't control very much
of what happens to you. But what you can con
trol is how you react to the things that do hap
pen. And there, I believe, is the key to finding
out about life.
Television star Bill Cosby at the University of
South Carolina, Columbia: As a parent, I know
that four years of college bring nothing more
than a learned person in terms of books, tests,
notes. But that maturity, that ability to read
other human beings, that maturity to make a
decision based on what is needed as opposed to
what you want — there's no degree for that. It's
a happy time for you. It's a time to get it to
gether, collect your family, collect the love and
then collect yourselves, because now comes the
maturity of self, the decisions to be made.
Young ladies and gentlemen, this is not your
world yet. You have to make it.
Secretary of Education William Bennett at the
Citadel, Charleston, S.C.: Isiah says, 'All our
works are nothing — our molten images are

empty wind.' There is support for theoretical
pessimism. But practically, operationally, you
should not bring such an attitude to your tasks.
You should go about your business with some
measure of enterprise, of seriousness, of good
humor and of interest. I do no mean to recom
mend, as the Schlitz Brewing Co. did some
years back, that 'You only go around once, so
grab all the gusto you can.' I'm not talking
about grabbing gusto or swilling beer. I'm
talking about living well, living a life worth
living. I offer the wise words of the Maharani of
Jaipur. She said once, 'Keep an open mind; an
open mind is a very good thing, but don't keep
your mind so open that your brains fall out.'
Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca at Duke Univer
sity, Durluim, N.C.: My class, the class of '46,
wasn't too worried about competing in the
world. There was hardly anybody to compete
with. But the class of '86 had better learn how
to compete, because you're living in a veiy dif
ferent world. Something else you'd better do
better than we have: learn how to balance the
books. We're leaving you with a $2 trillion na
tional debt. Along with your own problems and
your own bills, you're going to get the privilege
of handling some of mine. I'll tell you one thing:
don't try to pay it off in cash. It would take the
U.S. Mint 57 years, two months and two weeks
just to print it. We've been using your credit
card, and you didn't even know it.
Retiring President A. Bartlett Giamatti at Yale
University, New Haven, Conn.: As I think back
and look forward, I see how nothing is unam
biguous; nothing is without risk. Salvation does
not come through simplicities. The health of
educational insititutions rests on the need to be
mindful of the crucial distinctions between edu
cation and indoctrination. There are many who
lust for the simple answers of doctrine or
decree. They are on the Left and Right. They
are not confined to a single part of society. They
are the terrorists of the mind. (But) if freedom
does not first reside in the mind, it cannot finally
reside anywhere.
