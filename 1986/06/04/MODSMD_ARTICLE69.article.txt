# It's that time of year
## Commencement advice from all over 
### 
Every year, during the months of May and
June, large groups of students wearing long
gowns and funny-looking caps file into sports
arenas or stadiums and sit patiently, often under
a sweltering sun, while another person —
usually an older person — gives them advice.
This is known as "commencement." Follow
ing is some advice students at other schools
across the United States have received in the
past few weeks.
California Chief Justice Rose Bird at the Univer
sity of California, Davis: You should concen
trate on what you are doing now, and if you do
it well, things that you want will happen in the
future. I think that no matter how much ma
terial success you may achieve, you pave the
way to disappointment if you set up your five
and ten-year goals and say to yourself, 'By then
I want to be there.' We are here, I believe, to
achieve wisdom and live ethically. And if we can
look upon the journey of life as a learning
process, we will begin to perceive a lot of the
difficult and disappointing things that happen
along the way in a very different light — and
perhaps grow from the experience, rather than
turn bitter. You really can't control very much
of what happens to you. But what you can con
trol is how you react to the things that do hap
pen. And there, I believe, is the key to finding
out about life.
Television star Bill Cosby at the University of
South Carolina, Columbia: As a parent, I know
that four years of college bring nothing more
than a learned person in terms of books, tests,
notes. But that maturity, that ability to read
other human beings, that maturity to make a
decision based on what is needed as opposed to
what you want — there's no degree for that. It's
a happy time for you. It's a time to get it to
gether, collect your family, collect the love and
then collect yourselves, because now comes the
maturity of self, the decisions to be made.
Young ladies and gentlemen, this is not your
world yet. You have to make it.
Secretary of Education William Bennett at the
Citadel, Charleston, S.C.: Isiah says, 'All our
works are nothing — our molten images are

empty wind.' There is support for theoretical
pessimism. But practically, operationally, you
should not bring such an attitude to your tasks.
You should go about your business with some
measure of enterprise, of seriousness, of good
humor and of interest. I do no mean to recom
mend, as the Schlitz Brewing Co. did some
years back, that 'You only go around once, so
grab all the gusto you can.' I'm not talking
about grabbing gusto or swilling beer. I'm
talking about living well, living a life worth
living. I offer the wise words of the Maharani of
Jaipur. She said once, 'Keep an open mind; an
open mind is a very good thing, but don't keep
your mind so open that your brains fall out.'
Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca at Duke Univer
sity, Durluim, N.C.: My class, the class of '46,
wasn't too worried about competing in the
world. There was hardly anybody to compete
with. But the class of '86 had better learn how
to compete, because you're living in a veiy dif
ferent world. Something else you'd better do
better than we have: learn how to balance the
books. We're leaving you with a $2 trillion na
tional debt. Along with your own problems and
your own bills, you're going to get the privilege
of handling some of mine. I'll tell you one thing:
don't try to pay it off in cash. It would take the
U.S. Mint 57 years, two months and two weeks
just to print it. We've been using your credit
card, and you didn't even know it.
Retiring President A. Bartlett Giamatti at Yale
University, New Haven, Conn.: As I think back
and look forward, I see how nothing is unam
biguous; nothing is without risk. Salvation does
not come through simplicities. The health of
educational insititutions rests on the need to be
mindful of the crucial distinctions between edu
cation and indoctrination. There are many who
lust for the simple answers of doctrine or
decree. They are on the Left and Right. They
are not confined to a single part of society. They
are the terrorists of the mind. (But) if freedom
does not first reside in the mind, it cannot finally
reside anywhere.
Lawrence Wilder, Virginia's first black
Lieutenant Governor, at the University of Virginia,
Charlottesville: Much has been written about my not
being able to attend this university during my time.
1 he fact that my son finished his undergraduate studies
here and that my daughter is in this year's graduating
class warms me with a poetic and an ironic justice. We
have come to see that this country's insistence on right
can make a change. It did so in the archipelagoes of the
Philippines. It did so with the ravaged despotism in
Haiti, and it will and must do so in the blood-drenched
townships of South Africa. We've seen blacks rise to
compete at every level, if given the opportunity to do
so. But this did not just come'about. Some people had
to believe it so and fought for it to be — and it did.
Historian David McCullough at Middlebury College,
Middlebury, Vt.: Imagine a man who professes over
and over his unending love for a woman but who
knows nothing of where she was born or who her par
ents were or where she went to school or what her life
had been until he came along, and, furthermore, he
doesn't care to learn. What would you think of such a
person? Yet we appear to have a never-ending supply
of patriots who know nothing of the history of the
country, nor are they interested. We have not had a
president with a sense of history since John Kennedy
— not since most of you were born. It ought to be man
datory for the office. As we have a language require
ment for the foreign service, so we should have a his
tory requirement for the White House.
TV Newscaster Barbara Walters at Hofstra University,
Hempstead, N.Y.: This is not only the day when you
are most confident, it is also the day when you are most
vulnerable. Look at me. I sound like someone who
really knew what she wanted and got it. Baloney.
When I was graduating from college, I hadn't a clue.
You don't have to know now, and you probably
shouldn't know exactly now. The next time somebody
says, 'And what are you going to do?' try saying, 'I
don't know yet.' What a relief. You may not even want
a career. You may want a job and something else:
more time for yourself, more time to write, paint, ex
plore, create, have babies, stay home. ... The hardest
thing you will ever have to do is to trust your own gut
and find what seems to work for you.
Former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John Gavin at
Pepperdine University, Malibu, Calif.: I do encourage
you to maintain an active and healthy skepticism. That,
after all, is what a university preparation is about,
learning to judge, learning to think. I am constantly
amazed by the distortions and untruths I find in reports
and comments about subjects on which I am informed.
I therefore cannot help but have a healthy skepticism. I
encourage you to adopt the same attitude. It is wise to
remember, as my father says, that some people so trea
sure the truth that they use it with great economy.

Supreme Court Justice William Brennan at Brandeis
University, Walt ham, Mass.: Rulers always have and
always will find it dangerous to their security to permit
people to think, believe, talk, write, assemble and par
ticularly to criticize the government as they please. But
the language of the First Amendment indicates that the
founders weighed the risks involved in such freedoms
and deliberately chose to stake this government's se
curity and life upon preserving the liberty to discuss
public affairs intact and untouchable by government.
Planned Parenthood President Faye Wattleton at Spel
man College, Atlanta: Today we see efforts to tear
down the progress of affirmative action and the protec
tions of the Civil Rights Commission, the Civil Rights
Act and the Voting Rights Act. These are all
manifestations of a 'blame the victim' philosophy —
'We must force people to pull themselves up by their
own bootstraps, even if they have no boots.' This is a
crisis of no small measure for black families. And com
pounding it is the myth that poverty is a symptom of a
so-called pathology in the black community. This myth
ignores the social and economic climate in which the
black family struggles for survival. It ignores the
double standards used in family analysis. Single-parent
black households are called 'matriarchal,' while single
parent white households are described as 'alternative
lifestyles' headed by 'supermoms.'
Former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the
College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va.: I
have spoken at few commencement occasions for just
the reason that I do not feel that I am really sure what a
commencement speech should be, what to talk about
to people who are filled with pride and thoughts of par
ting and packing, and who are tired and tense. So I
asked my son, who is a student, what I should speak
about. 'I don't know,' he answered, 'but keep it short,
and don't talk about foreign policy.'
Author Tracy Kidder ("House," "The Soul of a New
Machine") at Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville,
N. Y.: If you do feel a little worried, don't worry about
being worried. You're heading out on an adventure,
and you can always change your mind along the way
and try something else. I know lots of people who have
done that, and none I can think of who regret it. What
some people I know do regret is the severing of con
nections between what they imagined themselves
doing and what they've ended up with. You want work
that is rewarding and altruistic, that is worth doing for
its own sake, not just for the price it commands.
Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum at Northern Michi
gan University, Marquette: When thinking of com
mencement exercises, I am always reminded of Bob
Hope's legendaiy commencement speech. Warning of
the dangers and disappointments of the 'cold, hard
world outside,' Mr. Hope gave his audience two words
of advice: 'Don't go.'

of what happens to you. But what you can con
trol is how you react to the things that do hap
pen. And there, I believe, is the key to finding
out about life.
Television star Bill Cosby at the University of
South Carolina, Columbia: As a parent, I know
that four years of college bring nothing more
than a learned person in terms of books, tests,
notes. But that maturity, that ability to read
other human beings, that maturity to make a
decision based on what is needed as opposed to
what you want — there's no degree for that. It's
a happy time for you. It's a time to get it to
gether, collect your family, collect the love and
then collect yourselves, because now comes the
maturity of self, the decisions to be made.
Young ladies and gentlemen, this is not your
world yet. You have to make it.
Secretary of Education William Bennett at the
Citadel, Charleston, S.C.: Isiah says, 'All our
works are nothing — our molten images are

empty wind.' There is support for theoretical
pessimism. But practically, operationally, you
should not bring such an attitude to your tasks.
You should go about your business with some
measure of enterprise, of seriousness, of good
humor and of interest. I do no mean to recom
mend, as the Schlitz Brewing Co. did some
years back, that 'You only go around once, so
grab all the gusto you can.' I'm not talking
about grabbing gusto or swilling beer. I'm
talking about living well, living a life worth
living. I offer the wise words of the Maharani of
Jaipur. She said once, 'Keep an open mind; an
open mind is a very good thing, but don't keep
your mind so open that your brains fall out.'
Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca at Duke Univer
sity, Durluim, N.C.: My class, the class of '46,
wasn't too worried about competing in the
world. There was hardly anybody to compete
with. But the class of '86 had better learn how
to compete, because you're living in a veiy dif
ferent world. Something else you'd better do
better than we have: learn how to balance the
books. We're leaving you with a $2 trillion na
tional debt. Along with your own problems and
your own bills, you're going to get the privilege
of handling some of mine. I'll tell you one thing:
don't try to pay it off in cash. It would take the
U.S. Mint 57 years, two months and two weeks
just to print it. We've been using your credit
card, and you didn't even know it.
Retiring President A. Bartlett Giamatti at Yale
University, New Haven, Conn.: As I think back
and look forward, I see how nothing is unam
biguous; nothing is without risk. Salvation does
not come through simplicities. The health of
educational insititutions rests on the need to be
mindful of the crucial distinctions between edu
cation and indoctrination. There are many who
lust for the simple answers of doctrine or
decree. They are on the Left and Right. They
are not confined to a single part of society. They
are the terrorists of the mind. (But) if freedom
does not first reside in the mind, it cannot finally
reside anywhere.
Lawrence Wilder, Virginia's first black
Lieutenant Governor, at the University of Virginia,
Charlottesville: Much has been written about my not
being able to attend this university during my time.
1 he fact that my son finished his undergraduate studies
here and that my daughter is in this year's graduating
class warms me with a poetic and an ironic justice. We
have come to see that this country's insistence on right
can make a change. It did so in the archipelagoes of the
Philippines. It did so with the ravaged despotism in
Haiti, and it will and must do so in the blood-drenched
townships of South Africa. We've seen blacks rise to
compete at every level, if given the opportunity to do
so. But this did not just come'about. Some people had
to believe it so and fought for it to be — and it did.
Historian David McCullough at Middlebury College,
Middlebury, Vt.: Imagine a man who professes over
and over his unending love for a woman but who
knows nothing of where she was born or who her par
ents were or where she went to school or what her life
had been until he came along, and, furthermore, he
doesn't care to learn. What would you think of such a
person? Yet we appear to have a never-ending supply
of patriots who know nothing of the history of the
country, nor are they interested. We have not had a
president with a sense of history since John Kennedy
— not since most of you were born. It ought to be man
datory for the office. As we have a language require
ment for the foreign service, so we should have a his
tory requirement for the White House.
TV Newscaster Barbara Walters at Hofstra University,
Hempstead, N.Y.: This is not only the day when you
are most confident, it is also the day when you are most
vulnerable. Look at me. I sound like someone who
really knew what she wanted and got it. Baloney.
When I was graduating from college, I hadn't a clue.
You don't have to know now, and you probably
shouldn't know exactly now. The next time somebody
says, 'And what are you going to do?' try saying, 'I
don't know yet.' What a relief. You may not even want
a career. You may want a job and something else:
more time for yourself, more time to write, paint, ex
plore, create, have babies, stay home. ... The hardest
thing you will ever have to do is to trust your own gut
and find what seems to work for you.
Former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John Gavin at
Pepperdine University, Malibu, Calif.: I do encourage
you to maintain an active and healthy skepticism. That,
after all, is what a university preparation is about,
learning to judge, learning to think. I am constantly
amazed by the distortions and untruths I find in reports
and comments about subjects on which I am informed.
I therefore cannot help but have a healthy skepticism. I
encourage you to adopt the same attitude. It is wise to
remember, as my father says, that some people so trea
sure the truth that they use it with great economy.

Supreme Court Justice William Brennan at Brandeis
University, Walt ham, Mass.: Rulers always have and
always will find it dangerous to their security to permit
people to think, believe, talk, write, assemble and par
ticularly to criticize the government as they please. But
the language of the First Amendment indicates that the
founders weighed the risks involved in such freedoms
and deliberately chose to stake this government's se
curity and life upon preserving the liberty to discuss
public affairs intact and untouchable by government.
Planned Parenthood President Faye Wattleton at Spel
man College, Atlanta: Today we see efforts to tear
down the progress of affirmative action and the protec
tions of the Civil Rights Commission, the Civil Rights
Act and the Voting Rights Act. These are all
manifestations of a 'blame the victim' philosophy —
'We must force people to pull themselves up by their
own bootstraps, even if they have no boots.' This is a
crisis of no small measure for black families. And com
pounding it is the myth that poverty is a symptom of a
so-called pathology in the black community. This myth
ignores the social and economic climate in which the
black family struggles for survival. It ignores the
double standards used in family analysis. Single-parent
black households are called 'matriarchal,' while single
parent white households are described as 'alternative
lifestyles' headed by 'supermoms.'
Former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the
College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va.: I
have spoken at few commencement occasions for just
the reason that I do not feel that I am really sure what a
commencement speech should be, what to talk about
to people who are filled with pride and thoughts of par
ting and packing, and who are tired and tense. So I
asked my son, who is a student, what I should speak
about. 'I don't know,' he answered, 'but keep it short,
and don't talk about foreign policy.'
Author Tracy Kidder ("House," "The Soul of a New
Machine") at Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville,
N. Y.: If you do feel a little worried, don't worry about
being worried. You're heading out on an adventure,
and you can always change your mind along the way
and try something else. I know lots of people who have
done that, and none I can think of who regret it. What
some people I know do regret is the severing of con
nections between what they imagined themselves
doing and what they've ended up with. You want work
that is rewarding and altruistic, that is worth doing for
its own sake, not just for the price it commands.
Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum at Northern Michi
gan University, Marquette: When thinking of com
mencement exercises, I am always reminded of Bob
Hope's legendaiy commencement speech. Warning of
the dangers and disappointments of the 'cold, hard
world outside,' Mr. Hope gave his audience two words
of advice: 'Don't go.'

Every year, during the months of May and
June, large groups of students wearing long
gowns and funny-looking caps file into sports
arenas or stadiums and sit patiently, often under
a sweltering sun, while another person —
usually an older person — gives them advice.
This is known as "commencement." Follow
ing is some advice students at other schools
across the United States have received in the
past few weeks.
California Chief Justice Rose Bird at the Univer
sity of California, Davis: You should concen
trate on what you are doing now, and if you do
it well, things that you want will happen in the
future. I think that no matter how much ma
terial success you may achieve, you pave the
way to disappointment if you set up your five
and ten-year goals and say to yourself, 'By then
I want to be there.' We are here, I believe, to
achieve wisdom and live ethically. And if we can
look upon the journey of life as a learning
process, we will begin to perceive a lot of the
difficult and disappointing things that happen
along the way in a very different light — and
perhaps grow from the experience, rather than
turn bitter. You really can't control very much
of what happens to you. But what you can con
trol is how you react to the things that do hap

humor and of interest. I do no mean to recom
mend, as the Schlitz Brewing Co. did some
years back, that 'You only go around once, so
grab all the gusto you can.' I'm not talking
about grabbing gusto or swilling beer. I'm
talking about living well, living a life worth
living. I offer the wise words of the Maharani of
Jaipur. She said once, 'Keep an open mind; an
open mind is a very good thing, but don't keep
your mind so open that your brains fall out.'
Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca at Duke Univer
sity, Durluim, N.C.: My class, the class of '46,
wasn't too worried about competing in the
world. There was hardly anybody to compete
with. But the class of '86 had better learn how
to compete, because you're living in a veiy dif
ferent world. Something else you'd better do
better than we have: learn how to balance the
books. We're leaving you with a $2 trillion na
tional debt. Along with your own problems and
your own bills, you're going to get the privilege
of handling some of mine. I'll tell you one thing:
don't try to pay it off in cash. It would take the
U.S. Mint 57 years, two months and two weeks
just to print it. We've been using your credit
card, and you didn't even know it.
Retiring President A. Bartlett Giamatti at Yale
University, New Haven, Conn.: As I think back
and look forward, I see how nothing is unam
biguous; nothing is without risk. Salvation does
not come through simplicities. The health of
educational insititutions rests on the need to be
mindful of the crucial distinctions between edu
cation and indoctrination. There are many who
lust for the simple answers of doctrine or
decree. They are on the Left and Right. They
are not confined to a single part of society. They
are the terrorists of the mind. (But) if freedom
does not first reside in the mind, it cannot finally
reside anywhere.
Lawrence Wilder, Virginia's first black
Lieutenant Governor, at the University of Virginia,
Charlottesville: Much has been written about my not
being able to attend this university during my time.
1 he fact that my son finished his undergraduate studies
here and that my daughter is in this year's graduating
class warms me with a poetic and an ironic justice. We
have come to see that this country's insistence on right
can make a change. It did so in the archipelagoes of the
Philippines. It did so with the ravaged despotism in
Haiti, and it will and must do so in the blood-drenched
townships of South Africa. We've seen blacks rise to
compete at every level, if given the opportunity to do
so. But this did not just come'about. Some people had
to believe it so and fought for it to be — and it did.
Historian David McCullough at Middlebury College,
Middlebury, Vt.: Imagine a man who professes over
and over his unending love for a woman but who
knows nothing of where she was born or who her par
ents were or where she went to school or what her life
had been until he came along, and, furthermore, he
doesn't care to learn. What would you think of such a
person? Yet we appear to have a never-ending supply
of patriots who know nothing of the history of the
country, nor are they interested. We have not had a
president with a sense of history since John Kennedy
— not since most of you were born. It ought to be man
datory for the office. As we have a language require
ment for the foreign service, so we should have a his
tory requirement for the White House.
TV Newscaster Barbara Walters at Hofstra University,
Hempstead, N.Y.: This is not only the day when you
are most confident, it is also the day when you are most
vulnerable. Look at me. I sound like someone who
really knew what she wanted and got it. Baloney.
When I was graduating from college, I hadn't a clue.
You don't have to know now, and you probably
shouldn't know exactly now. The next time somebody
says, 'And what are you going to do?' try saying, 'I
don't know yet.' What a relief. You may not even want
a career. You may want a job and something else:
more time for yourself, more time to write, paint, ex
plore, create, have babies, stay home. ... The hardest
thing you will ever have to do is to trust your own gut
and find what seems to work for you.
Former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John Gavin at
Pepperdine University, Malibu, Calif.: I do encourage
you to maintain an active and healthy skepticism. That,
after all, is what a university preparation is about,
learning to judge, learning to think. I am constantly
amazed by the distortions and untruths I find in reports
and comments about subjects on which I am informed.
I therefore cannot help but have a healthy skepticism. I
encourage you to adopt the same attitude. It is wise to
remember, as my father says, that some people so trea
sure the truth that they use it with great economy.

Supreme Court Justice William Brennan at Brandeis
University, Walt ham, Mass.: Rulers always have and
always will find it dangerous to their security to permit
people to think, believe, talk, write, assemble and par
ticularly to criticize the government as they please. But
the language of the First Amendment indicates that the
founders weighed the risks involved in such freedoms
and deliberately chose to stake this government's se
curity and life upon preserving the liberty to discuss
public affairs intact and untouchable by government.
Planned Parenthood President Faye Wattleton at Spel
man College, Atlanta: Today we see efforts to tear
down the progress of affirmative action and the protec
tions of the Civil Rights Commission, the Civil Rights
Act and the Voting Rights Act. These are all
manifestations of a 'blame the victim' philosophy —
'We must force people to pull themselves up by their
own bootstraps, even if they have no boots.' This is a
crisis of no small measure for black families. And com
pounding it is the myth that poverty is a symptom of a
so-called pathology in the black community. This myth
ignores the social and economic climate in which the
black family struggles for survival. It ignores the
double standards used in family analysis. Single-parent
black households are called 'matriarchal,' while single
parent white households are described as 'alternative
lifestyles' headed by 'supermoms.'
Former U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the
College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va.: I
have spoken at few commencement occasions for just
the reason that I do not feel that I am really sure what a
commencement speech should be, what to talk about
to people who are filled with pride and thoughts of par
ting and packing, and who are tired and tense. So I
asked my son, who is a student, what I should speak
about. 'I don't know,' he answered, 'but keep it short,
and don't talk about foreign policy.'
Author Tracy Kidder ("House," "The Soul of a New
Machine") at Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville,
N. Y.: If you do feel a little worried, don't worry about
being worried. You're heading out on an adventure,
and you can always change your mind along the way
and try something else. I know lots of people who have
done that, and none I can think of who regret it. What
some people I know do regret is the severing of con
nections between what they imagined themselves
doing and what they've ended up with. You want work
that is rewarding and altruistic, that is worth doing for
its own sake, not just for the price it commands.
Kansas Senator Nancy Kassebaum at Northern Michi
gan University, Marquette: When thinking of com
mencement exercises, I am always reminded of Bob
Hope's legendaiy commencement speech. Warning of
the dangers and disappointments of the 'cold, hard
world outside,' Mr. Hope gave his audience two words
of advice: 'Don't go.'

Every year, during the months of May and
June, large groups of students wearing long
gowns and funny-looking caps file into sports
arenas or stadiums and sit patiently, often under
a sweltering sun, while another person —
usually an older person — gives them advice.
This is known as "commencement." Follow
ing is some advice students at other schools
across the United States have received in the
past few weeks.
California Chief Justice Rose Bird at the Univer
sity of California, Davis: You should concen
trate on what you are doing now, and if you do
it well, things that you want will happen in the
future. I think that no matter how much ma
terial success you may achieve, you pave the
way to disappointment if you set up your five
and ten-year goals and say to yourself, 'By then
I want to be there.' We are here, I believe, to
achieve wisdom and live ethically. And if we can
look upon the journey of life as a learning
process, we will begin to perceive a lot of the
difficult and disappointing things that happen
along the way in a very different light — and
perhaps grow from the experience, rather than
turn bitter. You really can't control very much
of what happens to you. But what you can con
trol is how you react to the things that do hap
pen. And there, I believe, is the key to finding
out about life.
Television star Bill Cosby at the University of
South Carolina, Columbia: As a parent, I know
that four years of college bring nothing more
than a learned person in terms of books, tests,
notes. But that maturity, that ability to read
other human beings, that maturity to make a
decision based on what is needed as opposed to
what you want — there's no degree for that. It's
a happy time for you. It's a time to get it to
gether, collect your family, collect the love and
then collect yourselves, because now comes the
maturity of self, the decisions to be made.
Young ladies and gentlemen, this is not your
world yet. You have to make it.
Secretary of Education William Bennett at the
Citadel, Charleston, S.C.: Isiah says, 'All our
works are nothing — our molten images are

empty wind.' There is support for theoretical
pessimism. But practically, operationally, you
should not bring such an attitude to your tasks.
You should go about your business with some
measure of enterprise, of seriousness, of good
humor and of interest. I do no mean to recom
mend, as the Schlitz Brewing Co. did some
years back, that 'You only go around once, so
grab all the gusto you can.' I'm not talking
about grabbing gusto or swilling beer. I'm
