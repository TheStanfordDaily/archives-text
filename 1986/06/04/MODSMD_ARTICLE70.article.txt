# Looking back...moving forward

Four years of college necessitates a long
segment of someone's life, especially
mine. Was it worth it? Certainly in one
sense, since my parents paid for my tui
tion. But 1 remember being told how
much I would learn in college, how I
would change, how in many ways (other
than the acquisition of scholarly knowl
edge) Stanford would prepare me for the
rest of my life.
Has it happened?
I feel far more ignorant, more uncertain
about important aspects of life than when
I began my freshman year. Socrates said
that admission of ignorance is the first step
toward wisdom, but look what happened
to him.

MARSH T. McCALL

I write these words (and not just these
words, but those which follow) at the end
of finals week, the end of my four years at
Stanford University, and the day after my
twenty-second birthday. It feels strange to
look back on my stay here (believe me, it
feels strange to do anything this morning)
and think back on all those times. . ..
I remember so well, four years ago, my
parents wiping their tear-stained eyes and
gripping me tightly before I drove the
loaded-down car off to college. It was an
awkward moment for me, particularly as I
live five minutes away and would soon be
returning to collect my reading lamp and
some records.
"I need the car back by supper," my
father shouted after me.
My education in the area of communi
cations and mass media began almost im
mediately. One night, a month into my
freshman year, the walls of my Trancos
dorm room began to bulge outwards
visibly, the cracks spreading fast enough
so that one could actually see movement.
The Stanford Fire Department evacuated
the dormitory, determining later that the
building had simply been "settling."
The next morning a UPI reporter
knocked on my door and asked me about
the incident.
(Say something you know will get in
print, my roommate whispered con

spiratorially. 0.K., 1 chortled). 1 turned to
the reporter.
"It was like a mass LSD experience," I
said brightly.
The next day my statement was in the
Chronicle, the Examiner, the Mercury,
several TV and radio stations, and
relatives called my parents from New
York to ask how 1 was "adjusting" to col
lege life.
The week after that a prisoner at San
Quentin's maximum security prison wrote
me a letter, addressed to "Marsha"
McCall, asking if I could send him the
names and photos of "some nice Stanford
girls." As you can certainly understand,
after that affair I had no alternative but to
declare an English major and begin to
write for The Daily. And thus I graduate
looking for a newspaper job.
But these are but trivial instances of the
countless enriching experiences I have had
during my four years here. They said I
would graduate a different person and I
certainly have; I'm twenty pounds
heavier, I need glasses and my hair is turn
ing gray. As a student who chose a direc
tion in humanities 1 have been bombarded
with artistic and historical portrayals of
man's inhumanity, cruelty, despair and
pathos, and yet I still sing in the shower.
And why? Because the acoustics are bet
ter.
And 1 think others can discern a differ
ence. Only a few years ago, many
bartenders refused to serve me alcoholic
beverages after one glance at my driver's
license. These days they follow the same
procedure but I am served without fail.
Surely this phenomenon has occurred be
cause they sense my growing maturity, my
willingness to accept responsibility for my
actions, and my ever-expanding rapport
with all aspects of society.
Of course, nobody can graduate from
Stanford without experiencing some sad
ness. Here we have all been allowed to
live in a playground with 6,000 smart, in
teresting peers for four years, being of
fered an education by world-class experts
in their fields. Everything else aside, who
wouldn't be sad to say goodbye to such an
idyllic situation? Maybe Darth Vader.
And this is such a great country — for
people who just can't face leaving, they've

invented graduate school. (For those of
you who don't know, graduate students
are just like undergraduates except that
they are completely different. They look
gloomy, play chess at the Coffee House
and like to spend quiet evenings at home.
Males go bald.)
I feel anxious, of course. I don't have
definite plans, I don't have clear goals
(except to be happy and perhaps marry a
Vegas showgirl), and I feel a little lost,
pressured to immediately prove the value
of my four years here, instead of sleeping
a lot, which is what I did last summer.
But 1 think I've learned that I can do
what I want, and care about who I want,
and maybe even get what I want, once I
figure out what it is. And in that sense
graduation — as Mr. Collins points out
elsewhere in this fine issue — is the begin
ning, not the end. We have been given in
tellectual weapons to combat all that
which might conspire to keep us from ul
timate contentment (aimlessness, inability
to set priorities, those things in the mail
which say "You may already have won!").
And I believe those who measure their
education by the prestige of the job
they've obtained are making a mistake
from the very onset. I hope career
oriented people aren't foolish enough to
think they should postpone happiness so
that they might have fun later in life — be
cause they won't know how when they get
there.
Hmmm. This reflection on my four
years has gotten more serious than I in
tended. For parents and others expecting
something more somber all the way
through, I apologize.
But I'll tell you all one thing which you
can take seriously: I just reread this
column and, although it's not as entertain
ing as I hoped it would be, I'm not going
to rewrite it. Why? Because in two days
some people I'm not going to see for a
long time are leaving and I am going to tell
them what they mean to me before they
go-
That's one thing I've learned.

I feel far more ignorant, more uncertain
about important aspects of life than when
I began my freshman year. Socrates said
that admission of ignorance is the first step
toward wisdom, but look what happened
to him.

MARSH T. McCALL

I write these words (and not just these
words, but those which follow) at the end
of finals week, the end of my four years at
Stanford University, and the day after my
twenty-second birthday. It feels strange to
look back on my stay here (believe me, it
feels strange to do anything this morning)
and think back on all those times. . ..
I remember so well, four years ago, my
parents wiping their tear-stained eyes and
gripping me tightly before I drove the
loaded-down car off to college. It was an
awkward moment for me, particularly as I
live five minutes away and would soon be
returning to collect my reading lamp and
some records.
"I need the car back by supper," my
father shouted after me.
My education in the area of communi
cations and mass media began almost im
mediately. One night, a month into my
freshman year, the walls of my Trancos
dorm room began to bulge outwards
visibly, the cracks spreading fast enough
so that one could actually see movement.
The Stanford Fire Department evacuated
the dormitory, determining later that the
building had simply been "settling."
The next morning a UPI reporter
knocked on my door and asked me about
the incident.
(Say something you know will get in
print, my roommate whispered con

spiratorially. 0.K., 1 chortled). 1 turned to
the reporter.
"It was like a mass LSD experience," I
said brightly.
The next day my statement was in the
Chronicle, the Examiner, the Mercury,
several TV and radio stations, and
relatives called my parents from New
York to ask how 1 was "adjusting" to col
lege life.
The week after that a prisoner at San
Quentin's maximum security prison wrote
me a letter, addressed to "Marsha"
McCall, asking if I could send him the
names and photos of "some nice Stanford
girls." As you can certainly understand,
after that affair I had no alternative but to
declare an English major and begin to
write for The Daily. And thus I graduate
looking for a newspaper job.
But these are but trivial instances of the
countless enriching experiences I have had
during my four years here. They said I
would graduate a different person and I
certainly have; I'm twenty pounds
heavier, I need glasses and my hair is turn
ing gray. As a student who chose a direc
tion in humanities 1 have been bombarded
with artistic and historical portrayals of
man's inhumanity, cruelty, despair and
pathos, and yet I still sing in the shower.
And why? Because the acoustics are bet
ter.
And 1 think others can discern a differ
ence. Only a few years ago, many
bartenders refused to serve me alcoholic
beverages after one glance at my driver's
license. These days they follow the same
procedure but I am served without fail.
Surely this phenomenon has occurred be
cause they sense my growing maturity, my
willingness to accept responsibility for my
actions, and my ever-expanding rapport
with all aspects of society.
Of course, nobody can graduate from
Stanford without experiencing some sad
ness. Here we have all been allowed to
live in a playground with 6,000 smart, in
teresting peers for four years, being of
fered an education by world-class experts
in their fields. Everything else aside, who
wouldn't be sad to say goodbye to such an
idyllic situation? Maybe Darth Vader.
And this is such a great country — for
people who just can't face leaving, they've

invented graduate school. (For those of
you who don't know, graduate students
are just like undergraduates except that
they are completely different. They look
gloomy, play chess at the Coffee House
and like to spend quiet evenings at home.
Males go bald.)
I feel anxious, of course. I don't have
definite plans, I don't have clear goals
(except to be happy and perhaps marry a
Vegas showgirl), and I feel a little lost,
pressured to immediately prove the value
of my four years here, instead of sleeping
a lot, which is what I did last summer.
But 1 think I've learned that I can do
what I want, and care about who I want,
and maybe even get what I want, once I
figure out what it is. And in that sense
graduation — as Mr. Collins points out
elsewhere in this fine issue — is the begin
ning, not the end. We have been given in
tellectual weapons to combat all that
which might conspire to keep us from ul
timate contentment (aimlessness, inability
to set priorities, those things in the mail
which say "You may already have won!").
And I believe those who measure their
education by the prestige of the job
they've obtained are making a mistake
from the very onset. I hope career
oriented people aren't foolish enough to
think they should postpone happiness so
that they might have fun later in life — be
cause they won't know how when they get
there.
Hmmm. This reflection on my four
years has gotten more serious than I in
tended. For parents and others expecting
something more somber all the way
through, I apologize.
But I'll tell you all one thing which you
can take seriously: I just reread this
column and, although it's not as entertain
ing as I hoped it would be, I'm not going
to rewrite it. Why? Because in two days
some people I'm not going to see for a
long time are leaving and I am going to tell
them what they mean to me before they
go-
That's one thing I've learned.

Four years of college necessitates a long
segment of someone's life, especially
mine. Was it worth it? Certainly in one
sense, since my parents paid for my tui

would change, how in many ways (other
