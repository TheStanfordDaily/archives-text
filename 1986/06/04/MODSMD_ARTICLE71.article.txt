# A 						senior's reflections on a never-ending story
## 
### 
Commencement.
The root word in commencement is commence, I think. Normally I'd be
pretty confident on a point like that — it seems pretty clear cut, all right — but
it just doesn t seem to ring true. Commence means "to begin or initiate"; I
looked it up just to be sure. But does commencement have anything to do with
beginning things? I'd like to think so, but lately I'm not so damn sure.
Nobody talks about commencement like it was the beginning of anything,
112 irst of all, nobody calls it Commencement. For instance, I have not had even
one discussion like this:
Older Person: Well, Michael, 1 understand that you'll be commencing this
year.
Me: Yes sir, that's right, I'm commencing.
Older Person: It must feel good, commencing after all those years of study.
Me: Yes sir, quite a relief.

MICHAEL P. COLLINS

No, banter like that just doesn't echo in these solemn sandstone walls as the
year draws to a close. People don't talk about commencement — they talk
about Graduation.
Older Person: Well, Michael, 1 understand that you'll be graduating this
year.
Me: Yes sir.
Older Person: How does it feel, having college all done with and behind you
now?
Me: Well, it doesn't feel very much like commencing.. ..
Graduation! Now that's a something altogether different. Graduation paints
a much clearer mental picture: it has connotations of Leaving Things Behind,
and a certain self-perpetuating officious flavor to it What's that? A gradua
tion? I suppose I'll have to bring a tie. Junior's doing what? He's graduating?
Welllll, let's run out and get a bottle of champagne, then!
Harmless enough, of course. But it certainly doesn't have much to do with
initiating things, with getting things started. You do not hear this from your
uncle on graduation morning:
Your Uncle: (shaking your hand) Congratulations, son. You're beginning
and initiating now!
No. And this is not a coincidence. Graduation is not a time for idle banter
and everyday chit-chat. Indeed, careful observation of the social interaction of
the College Senior in the weeks (and even months) prior to graduation can be
very rigidly broken down into three inescapable and incontrovertible deci
sions: the Reminder of Fate, the Question of Fear, and the Knowledge of
Doom. Observe.
The Reminder of Fate
Person Other than Graduating Senior: Well, you're graduating!
Graduating Senior: Gee, thanks.
People never assume that you are fully cognizant of your upcoming gradua
tion. The Reminder of Fate has many forms. "I guess that school's just about
over for you!" they will say to you, presumably thinking that this little
icebreaker will get a real barn-burner of a conversation started. There's an en
tertaining twist on this one that only the younger undergrads can play. It's fun
to try at home. "Hey, next year Ted and I will be living in Wilbur," begins the
jape, as a group of friends get together one evening. "Janice is going to be in

Roble, of course, and Mike —" and here the speaker turns to you with a little
half-grin, . . .but I forgot. Mike won't be with us next year. Mike's going to
be living in ... in the Real World."
The Real World. It's the Gold Standard of the Reminder of Fate, the ham
mer that everybody likes to hold behind your back. It's funny, though. A lot of
people seem to know a great deal about this Real World; very few of them
seem to live there. Not now, anyway, but "I've been there." The Real World is
a place that one experiences and understands, not a place that one inhabits.
They could never live in the world that they perceive to be real, real because
we're brought up to think of pain and hurt and frustration and disillusion as
Real, while beauty, compassion, conviction and hope are fleeting and illusory.
All the while we're missing the Grand Point that underlies the Reminder of
Fate: the Real World is the one you choose to believe in. People who are
afraid of the Real World are people who understand that not everyone has the
privilege of making that choice. That's really quite a lot of what Stanford is
about: letting you claim the right to choose your own Real World. It isn't
trivial. It's essential. It's why we're buying champagne. Ijt's why we're wearing
ties.
The Question of Fear
Anybody: So, what are you going to do now?
Graduating Senior: Please immolate yourself.
There it is, the Question of Fear: what are you going to do now? Where will
you be next year? Have you got a job? These questions almost religiously fol
low on the heels of the Reminder of Fate (above) and gradually develop the
Knowledge of Doom (below). Friends and associates don't even consider
questions like "What would you like to do today?" anymore. The present is
dead. Black robes and square hats and champagne and ties have killed it The
world of the graduating senior is focused on something that people refer to,
with ominous regularity, as The Rest of Your Life.
Whoa now! That's a long time, the rest of your life. Seems like a big chunk of
time like that would hold a lot of unpredictable promise, a myriad of seren
dipitous eventualities, doesn't it? But no! It is the mandate of practically every
one the graduating senior meets that the rest of his life should be planned and
assured by the time that degree finds its way into his hands. Today? Hey, no
time for today! We're heading for tomorrow, and we're almost late! It's infec
tious. The prescribed collegiate conversation in the waning months of school
goes something like this:
Your Advisor: Congratulations, you're graduating. So, what will you be
doing now?
You: I decided to accept that entry-level management position with the in
vestment baking firm in Chicago, sir. I'll spend a year in their Commodities
training program and then three years in Marketing. A few months after that
I'll be scouted by a head-hunting firm in New York and offered a job in Ac
counts. I'll take it, of course, move to New York and build a family. Why, in
five years' time I'll be pulling down enough to buy that little time-share cottage
on the Cape. We'll send the kids to Andover and then — well, heck, I suppose
they'll end up right back here at Stanford!
Your Advisor: I see. And what then?
And so it goes. But imagine a future without such constraints. I wonder if
you can?
Your Advisor: So .. . what next?
You: Sir, I really don't have the slightest idea what I'm going to be doing
with the rest of my life, and frankly, it scares the hell out of me.
Your Advisor: (in a whispered hush) What was that you said?
You: (confused) I said I don't have any idea what I'm doing. . . .
Your Advisor: (jubilant) That's it! You said it! Don't you see? You've won!

You don't know! It's the only right answer! (Your advisor peels off his latex
disguise to reveal himself as Willy Wonka, who is real and true and does grant
wishes and now offers you the world.)
You: Wow.
Unfortunately, my advisor has not yet revealed his true Wonka-nature to
me, congratulating me on the wisdom of leaving myself open to whatever lies
ahead. He's probably just a little shy; I can wait. After all, I'm commencing
today. Beginning. There's the Rest of My Life for revelations.
The Knowledge of Doom
The Knowledge of Doom is not unique to graduation; it is internalized in
various forms from grammar school onward. It becomes most compelling and
worrisome, however, as graduation approaches. The Knowledge of Doom is
simply this: no matter what you are doing, somebody else is doing something
better.
The Knowledge of Doom, then, hits home first with those who have ab
solutely no plans for the future. It is sufficient in those cases to simply remind
them that most of their classmates are getting jobs, ergo, you must be a loser.
Doom! Nothing to it.
Poignant though this first level of doom may sound, it is as nothing
compared to the frustration suffered by those who do have jobs (or other
various plans) when they realize that there is always someone with a better job.
This is the true Knowledge of Doom. A poker game I played just last week will
serve as an example:
Nina: What are you going to do next year, Mike?
Me: (mumbling) Mumble, mumble, mumble.
Nina: (laughing) I'm going into Real Estate.
Rob: Really? Well, I'll be attending Harvard Law School in the fall. ...
Heidi: Did I mention that I'll be taking over as vice-president in charge of
Monetary Acquisition with that firm in D.C.?
Craig: (Opening the door with a flourish) Hey, did you hear about Butch?
He was just offered peerage to the British throne and designation as Crown
Prince of the Netherlands!
And so it goes. Only one thing can possibly overcome the Knowledge of
Doom: Do What You Wish. That simple phrase was written on the back of a
magic necklace in Michael Ende's gentle fantasy, "The Never Ending Story."
Magic words from a children's fable. Nobody is doing anything better than you
are when you're simply doing whatever it is that brings you happiness. Odd
that so few classes study "The Never Ending Story."
Commencement
Such are the three great pronouncements of graduation. Not so bad, really.
We listen to the speeches, shake a lot of hands, trade addresses.
And here we go. Beginning and initiating. I'll tell you the truth: myself, I
believe it. The works. Even the ties and champagne. Serendipity — it all comes
down to that. Poet Rodger Waters, who might just as well have been writing
about graduation, but was in fact facing up to something much darker and
more frightening, had an understanding of all this. "Ashes and diamonds, foe
and friend, we were all equal in the end," he wrote. Let's make that a little
happier — we were all equal in the beginning. There, I like the feel of that.
Beginning. Commencement. Graduation.
Do what you wish.
Michael Collins is a senior majoring in geology with a creative writing emphasis.
His heroes are Bob Geldofand Hunter Thompson. He would like to be a pirate.

tion? I suppose I'll have to bring a tie. Junior's doing what? He's graduating?
Welllll, let's run out and get a bottle of champagne, then!
Harmless enough, of course. But it certainly doesn't have much to do with
initiating things, with getting things started. You do not hear this from your
uncle on graduation morning:
Your Uncle: (shaking your hand) Congratulations, son. You're beginning
and initiating now!
No. And this is not a coincidence. Graduation is not a time for idle banter
and everyday chit-chat. Indeed, careful observation of the social interaction of
the College Senior in the weeks (and even months) prior to graduation can be
very rigidly broken down into three inescapable and incontrovertible deci
sions: the Reminder of Fate, the Question of Fear, and the Knowledge of
Doom. Observe.
The Reminder of Fate
Person Other than Graduating Senior: Well, you're graduating!
Graduating Senior: Gee, thanks.
People never assume that you are fully cognizant of your upcoming gradua
tion. The Reminder of Fate has many forms. "I guess that school's just about
over for you!" they will say to you, presumably thinking that this little
icebreaker will get a real barn-burner of a conversation started. There's an en
tertaining twist on this one that only the younger undergrads can play. It's fun
to try at home. "Hey, next year Ted and I will be living in Wilbur," begins the
jape, as a group of friends get together one evening. "Janice is going to be in

Roble, of course, and Mike —" and here the speaker turns to you with a little
half-grin, . . .but I forgot. Mike won't be with us next year. Mike's going to
be living in ... in the Real World."
The Real World. It's the Gold Standard of the Reminder of Fate, the ham
mer that everybody likes to hold behind your back. It's funny, though. A lot of
people seem to know a great deal about this Real World; very few of them
seem to live there. Not now, anyway, but "I've been there." The Real World is
a place that one experiences and understands, not a place that one inhabits.
They could never live in the world that they perceive to be real, real because
we're brought up to think of pain and hurt and frustration and disillusion as
Real, while beauty, compassion, conviction and hope are fleeting and illusory.
All the while we're missing the Grand Point that underlies the Reminder of
Fate: the Real World is the one you choose to believe in. People who are
afraid of the Real World are people who understand that not everyone has the
privilege of making that choice. That's really quite a lot of what Stanford is
about: letting you claim the right to choose your own Real World. It isn't
trivial. It's essential. It's why we're buying champagne. Ijt's why we're wearing
ties.
The Question of Fear
Anybody: So, what are you going to do now?
Graduating Senior: Please immolate yourself.
There it is, the Question of Fear: what are you going to do now? Where will
you be next year? Have you got a job? These questions almost religiously fol
low on the heels of the Reminder of Fate (above) and gradually develop the
Knowledge of Doom (below). Friends and associates don't even consider
questions like "What would you like to do today?" anymore. The present is
dead. Black robes and square hats and champagne and ties have killed it The
world of the graduating senior is focused on something that people refer to,
with ominous regularity, as The Rest of Your Life.
Whoa now! That's a long time, the rest of your life. Seems like a big chunk of
time like that would hold a lot of unpredictable promise, a myriad of seren
dipitous eventualities, doesn't it? But no! It is the mandate of practically every
one the graduating senior meets that the rest of his life should be planned and
assured by the time that degree finds its way into his hands. Today? Hey, no
time for today! We're heading for tomorrow, and we're almost late! It's infec
tious. The prescribed collegiate conversation in the waning months of school
goes something like this:
Your Advisor: Congratulations, you're graduating. So, what will you be
doing now?
You: I decided to accept that entry-level management position with the in
vestment baking firm in Chicago, sir. I'll spend a year in their Commodities
training program and then three years in Marketing. A few months after that
I'll be scouted by a head-hunting firm in New York and offered a job in Ac
counts. I'll take it, of course, move to New York and build a family. Why, in
five years' time I'll be pulling down enough to buy that little time-share cottage
on the Cape. We'll send the kids to Andover and then — well, heck, I suppose
they'll end up right back here at Stanford!
Your Advisor: I see. And what then?
And so it goes. But imagine a future without such constraints. I wonder if
you can?
Your Advisor: So .. . what next?
You: Sir, I really don't have the slightest idea what I'm going to be doing
with the rest of my life, and frankly, it scares the hell out of me.
Your Advisor: (in a whispered hush) What was that you said?
You: (confused) I said I don't have any idea what I'm doing. . . .
Your Advisor: (jubilant) That's it! You said it! Don't you see? You've won!

You don't know! It's the only right answer! (Your advisor peels off his latex
disguise to reveal himself as Willy Wonka, who is real and true and does grant
wishes and now offers you the world.)
You: Wow.
Unfortunately, my advisor has not yet revealed his true Wonka-nature to
me, congratulating me on the wisdom of leaving myself open to whatever lies
ahead. He's probably just a little shy; I can wait. After all, I'm commencing
today. Beginning. There's the Rest of My Life for revelations.
The Knowledge of Doom
The Knowledge of Doom is not unique to graduation; it is internalized in
various forms from grammar school onward. It becomes most compelling and
worrisome, however, as graduation approaches. The Knowledge of Doom is
simply this: no matter what you are doing, somebody else is doing something
better.
The Knowledge of Doom, then, hits home first with those who have ab
solutely no plans for the future. It is sufficient in those cases to simply remind
them that most of their classmates are getting jobs, ergo, you must be a loser.
Doom! Nothing to it.
Poignant though this first level of doom may sound, it is as nothing
compared to the frustration suffered by those who do have jobs (or other
various plans) when they realize that there is always someone with a better job.
This is the true Knowledge of Doom. A poker game I played just last week will
serve as an example:
Nina: What are you going to do next year, Mike?
Me: (mumbling) Mumble, mumble, mumble.
Nina: (laughing) I'm going into Real Estate.
Rob: Really? Well, I'll be attending Harvard Law School in the fall. ...
Heidi: Did I mention that I'll be taking over as vice-president in charge of
Monetary Acquisition with that firm in D.C.?
Craig: (Opening the door with a flourish) Hey, did you hear about Butch?
He was just offered peerage to the British throne and designation as Crown
Prince of the Netherlands!
And so it goes. Only one thing can possibly overcome the Knowledge of
Doom: Do What You Wish. That simple phrase was written on the back of a
magic necklace in Michael Ende's gentle fantasy, "The Never Ending Story."
Magic words from a children's fable. Nobody is doing anything better than you
are when you're simply doing whatever it is that brings you happiness. Odd
that so few classes study "The Never Ending Story."
Commencement
Such are the three great pronouncements of graduation. Not so bad, really.
We listen to the speeches, shake a lot of hands, trade addresses.
And here we go. Beginning and initiating. I'll tell you the truth: myself, I
believe it. The works. Even the ties and champagne. Serendipity — it all comes
down to that. Poet Rodger Waters, who might just as well have been writing
about graduation, but was in fact facing up to something much darker and
more frightening, had an understanding of all this. "Ashes and diamonds, foe
and friend, we were all equal in the end," he wrote. Let's make that a little
happier — we were all equal in the beginning. There, I like the feel of that.
Beginning. Commencement. Graduation.
Do what you wish.
Michael Collins is a senior majoring in geology with a creative writing emphasis.
His heroes are Bob Geldofand Hunter Thompson. He would like to be a pirate.
Commencement.
The root word in commencement is commence, I think. Normally I'd be
pretty confident on a point like that — it seems pretty clear cut, all right — but
it just doesn t seem to ring true. Commence means "to begin or initiate"; I
looked it up just to be sure. But does commencement have anything to do with
beginning things? I'd like to think so, but lately I'm not so damn sure.
Nobody talks about commencement like it was the beginning of anything,
112 irst of all, nobody calls it Commencement. For instance, I have not had even
one discussion like this:
Older Person: Well, Michael, 1 understand that you'll be commencing this
year.
Me: Yes sir, that's right, I'm commencing.
Older Person: It must feel good, commencing after all those years of study.
Me: Yes sir, quite a relief.

MICHAEL P. COLLINS

No, banter like that just doesn't echo in these solemn sandstone walls as the
year draws to a close. People don't talk about commencement — they talk
about Graduation.
Older Person: Well, Michael, 1 understand that you'll be graduating this
year.
Me: Yes sir.
Older Person: How does it feel, having college all done with and behind you
now?
Me: Well, it doesn't feel very much like commencing.. ..
Graduation! Now that's a something altogether different. Graduation paints
a much clearer mental picture: it has connotations of Leaving Things Behind,
and a certain self-perpetuating officious flavor to it What's that? A gradua
tion? I suppose I'll have to bring a tie. Junior's doing what? He's graduating?
Welllll, let's run out and get a bottle of champagne, then!

Roble, of course, and Mike —" and here the speaker turns to you with a little
half-grin, . . .but I forgot. Mike won't be with us next year. Mike's going to
be living in ... in the Real World."
The Real World. It's the Gold Standard of the Reminder of Fate, the ham
mer that everybody likes to hold behind your back. It's funny, though. A lot of
people seem to know a great deal about this Real World; very few of them
seem to live there. Not now, anyway, but "I've been there." The Real World is
a place that one experiences and understands, not a place that one inhabits.
They could never live in the world that they perceive to be real, real because
we're brought up to think of pain and hurt and frustration and disillusion as
Real, while beauty, compassion, conviction and hope are fleeting and illusory.
All the while we're missing the Grand Point that underlies the Reminder of
Fate: the Real World is the one you choose to believe in. People who are
afraid of the Real World are people who understand that not everyone has the
privilege of making that choice. That's really quite a lot of what Stanford is
about: letting you claim the right to choose your own Real World. It isn't
trivial. It's essential. It's why we're buying champagne. Ijt's why we're wearing
ties.
The Question of Fear
Anybody: So, what are you going to do now?
Graduating Senior: Please immolate yourself.
There it is, the Question of Fear: what are you going to do now? Where will
you be next year? Have you got a job? These questions almost religiously fol
low on the heels of the Reminder of Fate (above) and gradually develop the
Knowledge of Doom (below). Friends and associates don't even consider
questions like "What would you like to do today?" anymore. The present is
dead. Black robes and square hats and champagne and ties have killed it The
world of the graduating senior is focused on something that people refer to,
with ominous regularity, as The Rest of Your Life.
Whoa now! That's a long time, the rest of your life. Seems like a big chunk of
time like that would hold a lot of unpredictable promise, a myriad of seren
dipitous eventualities, doesn't it? But no! It is the mandate of practically every
one the graduating senior meets that the rest of his life should be planned and
assured by the time that degree finds its way into his hands. Today? Hey, no
time for today! We're heading for tomorrow, and we're almost late! It's infec
tious. The prescribed collegiate conversation in the waning months of school
goes something like this:
Your Advisor: Congratulations, you're graduating. So, what will you be
doing now?
You: I decided to accept that entry-level management position with the in
vestment baking firm in Chicago, sir. I'll spend a year in their Commodities
training program and then three years in Marketing. A few months after that
I'll be scouted by a head-hunting firm in New York and offered a job in Ac
counts. I'll take it, of course, move to New York and build a family. Why, in
five years' time I'll be pulling down enough to buy that little time-share cottage
on the Cape. We'll send the kids to Andover and then — well, heck, I suppose
they'll end up right back here at Stanford!
Your Advisor: I see. And what then?
And so it goes. But imagine a future without such constraints. I wonder if
you can?
Your Advisor: So .. . what next?
You: Sir, I really don't have the slightest idea what I'm going to be doing
with the rest of my life, and frankly, it scares the hell out of me.
Your Advisor: (in a whispered hush) What was that you said?
You: (confused) I said I don't have any idea what I'm doing. . . .
Your Advisor: (jubilant) That's it! You said it! Don't you see? You've won!

You don't know! It's the only right answer! (Your advisor peels off his latex
disguise to reveal himself as Willy Wonka, who is real and true and does grant
wishes and now offers you the world.)
You: Wow.
Unfortunately, my advisor has not yet revealed his true Wonka-nature to
me, congratulating me on the wisdom of leaving myself open to whatever lies
ahead. He's probably just a little shy; I can wait. After all, I'm commencing
today. Beginning. There's the Rest of My Life for revelations.
The Knowledge of Doom
The Knowledge of Doom is not unique to graduation; it is internalized in
various forms from grammar school onward. It becomes most compelling and
worrisome, however, as graduation approaches. The Knowledge of Doom is
simply this: no matter what you are doing, somebody else is doing something
better.
The Knowledge of Doom, then, hits home first with those who have ab
solutely no plans for the future. It is sufficient in those cases to simply remind
them that most of their classmates are getting jobs, ergo, you must be a loser.
Doom! Nothing to it.
Poignant though this first level of doom may sound, it is as nothing
compared to the frustration suffered by those who do have jobs (or other
various plans) when they realize that there is always someone with a better job.
This is the true Knowledge of Doom. A poker game I played just last week will
serve as an example:
Nina: What are you going to do next year, Mike?
Me: (mumbling) Mumble, mumble, mumble.
Nina: (laughing) I'm going into Real Estate.
Rob: Really? Well, I'll be attending Harvard Law School in the fall. ...
Heidi: Did I mention that I'll be taking over as vice-president in charge of
Monetary Acquisition with that firm in D.C.?
Craig: (Opening the door with a flourish) Hey, did you hear about Butch?
He was just offered peerage to the British throne and designation as Crown
Prince of the Netherlands!
And so it goes. Only one thing can possibly overcome the Knowledge of
Doom: Do What You Wish. That simple phrase was written on the back of a
magic necklace in Michael Ende's gentle fantasy, "The Never Ending Story."
Magic words from a children's fable. Nobody is doing anything better than you
are when you're simply doing whatever it is that brings you happiness. Odd
that so few classes study "The Never Ending Story."
Commencement
Such are the three great pronouncements of graduation. Not so bad, really.
We listen to the speeches, shake a lot of hands, trade addresses.
And here we go. Beginning and initiating. I'll tell you the truth: myself, I
believe it. The works. Even the ties and champagne. Serendipity — it all comes
down to that. Poet Rodger Waters, who might just as well have been writing
about graduation, but was in fact facing up to something much darker and
more frightening, had an understanding of all this. "Ashes and diamonds, foe
and friend, we were all equal in the end," he wrote. Let's make that a little
happier — we were all equal in the beginning. There, I like the feel of that.
Beginning. Commencement. Graduation.
Do what you wish.
Michael Collins is a senior majoring in geology with a creative writing emphasis.
His heroes are Bob Geldofand Hunter Thompson. He would like to be a pirate.
Commencement.
The root word in commencement is commence, I think. Normally I'd be
pretty confident on a point like that — it seems pretty clear cut, all right — but
it just doesn t seem to ring true. Commence means "to begin or initiate"; I
looked it up just to be sure. But does commencement have anything to do with
beginning things? I'd like to think so, but lately I'm not so damn sure.
Nobody talks about commencement like it was the beginning of anything,
112 irst of all, nobody calls it Commencement. For instance, I have not had even
one discussion like this:
Older Person: Well, Michael, 1 understand that you'll be commencing this
year.
Me: Yes sir, that's right, I'm commencing.
Older Person: It must feel good, commencing after all those years of study.
Me: Yes sir, quite a relief.

MICHAEL P. COLLINS

No, banter like that just doesn't echo in these solemn sandstone walls as the
year draws to a close. People don't talk about commencement — they talk
about Graduation.
Older Person: Well, Michael, 1 understand that you'll be graduating this
year.
Me: Yes sir.
Older Person: How does it feel, having college all done with and behind you
now?
Me: Well, it doesn't feel very much like commencing.. ..
Graduation! Now that's a something altogether different. Graduation paints
a much clearer mental picture: it has connotations of Leaving Things Behind,
and a certain self-perpetuating officious flavor to it What's that? A gradua
tion? I suppose I'll have to bring a tie. Junior's doing what? He's graduating?
Welllll, let's run out and get a bottle of champagne, then!
Harmless enough, of course. But it certainly doesn't have much to do with
initiating things, with getting things started. You do not hear this from your
uncle on graduation morning:
Your Uncle: (shaking your hand) Congratulations, son. You're beginning
and initiating now!
No. And this is not a coincidence. Graduation is not a time for idle banter
and everyday chit-chat. Indeed, careful observation of the social interaction of
the College Senior in the weeks (and even months) prior to graduation can be
very rigidly broken down into three inescapable and incontrovertible deci
sions: the Reminder of Fate, the Question of Fear, and the Knowledge of
Doom. Observe.
The Reminder of Fate
Person Other than Graduating Senior: Well, you're graduating!
Graduating Senior: Gee, thanks.
People never assume that you are fully cognizant of your upcoming gradua
tion. The Reminder of Fate has many forms. "I guess that school's just about
over for you!" they will say to you, presumably thinking that this little
icebreaker will get a real barn-burner of a conversation started. There's an en
tertaining twist on this one that only the younger undergrads can play. It's fun
to try at home. "Hey, next year Ted and I will be living in Wilbur," begins the
jape, as a group of friends get together one evening. "Janice is going to be in

Roble, of course, and Mike —" and here the speaker turns to you with a little
half-grin, . . .but I forgot. Mike won't be with us next year. Mike's going to
be living in ... in the Real World."
The Real World. It's the Gold Standard of the Reminder of Fate, the ham
mer that everybody likes to hold behind your back. It's funny, though. A lot of
people seem to know a great deal about this Real World; very few of them
seem to live there. Not now, anyway, but "I've been there." The Real World is
