# MORE ESSENCE OF MATTER

Article #6

PART 1:
An energy principle of equivalence was introduced on May
23rd in Article #4. It should be Kept in mind that a unified field
theory implies a principle of equivalence for energy, force,
and momentum. Eo = moC 2 and E = hf are thus not distinct
equations defining different types of energy, rather they are
different forms of the new equation E = mc-n-Df/fl where:
moC = mc/ 0
h = mc7rD/0
c = 7rDf
We also stated on May 23rd, when we defined momentum as
a pure physical entity, it was more correct to rewrite our equa
tion as E = p7rDf/0.
An adjustment is now needed in our unified field equation,
E - p7rDf/0. The equation, as has been stated often enough,
was derived by substituting the geometric statement of
velocity, 7rDf, into Einstein's equation for the rest energy of a
particle. By deriving the equation in this manner only circular
orbits were implied. However, eliptical orbits are allowed if we
write velocity as equal to orbit size times frequency of orbit. In
articles 1 and 5 we stated \ = orbit size. Therefore, it would
be more appropriate to rewrite our new energy equation with
the \ term in place of 7tD, where \ can arise from either elipti
cal or circular orbits. Our equation becomes:
E = p\f/0 = p7rDf/0 for circular orbits (A = ttD)
When this equation is written for atomic particles the p term is
the maximum particle momentum. We saw this maximum
particle momentum was given as the rest mass of a proton
times the velocity of light, pin equals the effective momen
tum of a particle and equals the proton orbital momentum
when 0 equals 1.
In the macro world the equation is still written, E = p\f/0. The
p/0 term is still effective momentum, but now of an aggregate
body consisting of many particles. In the macro world p by it
self is the maximum momentum of a body whose value is not
known, since it requires we know the size of the minimum or
bit of this aggregate body. The author feels this minimum or
bit might be given by the aggregate body's circumference,
but it may be given by some other size, such as the circum
ference of the aggregate body when its atoms are com
pressed to neutrons.
An example may clarify the situation. The energy of the earth
can be written as:

E (earth) = pWO+p a WO
Here pp Id is the effective momentum of atomic particles
which is distinguished from p a 10, the effective momentum of
the aggregate earth. The first term is the sum of the particle
rest energies, the second term kinetic energy. Note, there is
no 1/2 fraction preceding the second term. The earth's
changes in momentum when orbiting generates energy
based on the frequency of orbit. The energy is relative to an
observer who is not orbiting (for instance an observer outside
our solar system). The classical 1/2 term for kineteic energy
implies a collision where the initial effective momentum is
p a lo and the final effective momentum is zero, allowing the
average momentum during collision to be given by 1/2 p a Id.
p a 10, the effective momentum for the earth, will equal the
earth's effective mass times orbital velocity. The 0 term is
needed to define that this effective momentum is based on
some maximum momentum p a . Without the 0 term we could
not account for forces falling off with distance squared (see
article #3, May 16th).
Writing pp 10 for effective particle momentum and p a 10 for ef
fective aggregate body momentum is only a conventional
need to avoid confusion. Momentum is momentum and the
universal teri.i for effective momentum is plo. That is, the
equation, E = p\f 10 is the only equation needed. We write:
E (total) = p \f/0 + p a Af/0
to distinguish the individual momentum terms.
PART 2:
For the equation, E = pAf/0, we find it difficult to provide a
model for a photon in flat space (flat spacetime) where the
term 0 is infinite. While the equation defines the photon as a
particle, with momentum plO when it has angular momentum
(relative to an observer), it also defines it as nothing when it
possesses no angular momentum (p 10 = 0 when 0 is infinite).
The confusion is somewhat greater than to simply state a
photon in space has no particle nature, but when in orbit has
a particle nature.
The electron is a particle defined by its complete photon orbit.
We cannot examine just the photon at a given instance in
time while it is in orbit, for when we try to do this, the particle
no longer exists. In effect, to study just the photon and not
just the particle it describes, requires that we enter the
spacetime of the photon. When our spacetimes are similar,
the photon has no angular momentum relative to us and is
gone.

It was stated in our May 2nd article, if we were of atomic di
mensions and stood next to a proton, we would see it. If we
tried to push the proton, we would find it has an effective
mass. However, if we started traveling in an orbit, just outside
the orbit of the photon describing the proton, we would find
when we were traveling at V2 the speed of light that we could
push the proton with Va (corrected from V2) our initial effort.
That is, its effective mass would be a value Va what we mea
sured before we started orbiting. When our orbit speed
reached the speed of light, the proton next to us would have
disappeared. Thus, while we are able to understand the
photon when it has angular momentum (relative to us) and
defines a particle, we seem unable to understand it (describe
it) when it has no angular momentum.
A photon with no angular momentum has become a part of
space. We attempt to visualize this by considering a universe
containing two entities. The first, a hydrogen atom, consisting
of an electron and proton. The second, a neutron. Each, as
we asserted in earlier articles, consists of two photons. We
separate these two entities by 186,000 miles, one light
second in spacetime.
Both hydrogen atom and neutron, by their existence, effect
the spacetime of the other. The effects are not identical, since
the hydrogen atom has a slightly higher effective mass than
does a neutron. Each causes the other to orbit around itself,
but the orbit of the neutron around the hydrogen atom is
slightly tighter than the orbit of the hydrogen atom around the
neutron, owing to the slightly greater effective mass of the hy
drogen atom. We ask what happens if thp hydrogen atom
should suddenly collapse to a neutron?
After collapse the hydrogen atom's effective mass has been
reduced and therefore, the effect it has on the universe,
which includes the initial neutron, is reduced. The transmis
sion of this event (hydrogen atom collapse) must travel
throughout space. In one second it reaches the original
neutron.
The original neutron receives a message that its spacetime is
less effected and thus its orbit, around the hydrogen atom,
which is now a neutron, can be opened slightly. But if the
original neutron is going to have a more open orbit, then the
new neutron must have a tighter orbit if universal angular mo
mentum is to be conserved. This can only occur if the original
neutron becomes a hydrogen atom.
What was it that traveled between the two entities at the
speed of light? The traveler was a message that spacetime
curvature was undergoing a change. We call this traveling
message, electromagnetic radiation, or we might also call
this traveling message a gravitational wave.

An example may clarify the situation. The energy of the earth
can be written as:

E (earth) = pWO+p a WO
Here pp Id is the effective momentum of atomic particles
which is distinguished from p a 10, the effective momentum of
the aggregate earth. The first term is the sum of the particle
rest energies, the second term kinetic energy. Note, there is
no 1/2 fraction preceding the second term. The earth's
changes in momentum when orbiting generates energy
based on the frequency of orbit. The energy is relative to an
observer who is not orbiting (for instance an observer outside
our solar system). The classical 1/2 term for kineteic energy
implies a collision where the initial effective momentum is
p a lo and the final effective momentum is zero, allowing the
average momentum during collision to be given by 1/2 p a Id.
p a 10, the effective momentum for the earth, will equal the
earth's effective mass times orbital velocity. The 0 term is
needed to define that this effective momentum is based on
some maximum momentum p a . Without the 0 term we could
not account for forces falling off with distance squared (see
article #3, May 16th).
Writing pp 10 for effective particle momentum and p a 10 for ef
fective aggregate body momentum is only a conventional
need to avoid confusion. Momentum is momentum and the
universal teri.i for effective momentum is plo. That is, the
equation, E = p\f 10 is the only equation needed. We write:
E (total) = p \f/0 + p a Af/0
to distinguish the individual momentum terms.
PART 2:
For the equation, E = pAf/0, we find it difficult to provide a
model for a photon in flat space (flat spacetime) where the
term 0 is infinite. While the equation defines the photon as a
particle, with momentum plO when it has angular momentum
(relative to an observer), it also defines it as nothing when it
possesses no angular momentum (p 10 = 0 when 0 is infinite).
The confusion is somewhat greater than to simply state a
photon in space has no particle nature, but when in orbit has
a particle nature.
The electron is a particle defined by its complete photon orbit.
We cannot examine just the photon at a given instance in
time while it is in orbit, for when we try to do this, the particle
no longer exists. In effect, to study just the photon and not
just the particle it describes, requires that we enter the
spacetime of the photon. When our spacetimes are similar,
the photon has no angular momentum relative to us and is
gone.

It was stated in our May 2nd article, if we were of atomic di
mensions and stood next to a proton, we would see it. If we
tried to push the proton, we would find it has an effective
mass. However, if we started traveling in an orbit, just outside
the orbit of the photon describing the proton, we would find
when we were traveling at V2 the speed of light that we could
push the proton with Va (corrected from V2) our initial effort.
That is, its effective mass would be a value Va what we mea
sured before we started orbiting. When our orbit speed
reached the speed of light, the proton next to us would have
disappeared. Thus, while we are able to understand the
photon when it has angular momentum (relative to us) and
defines a particle, we seem unable to understand it (describe
it) when it has no angular momentum.
A photon with no angular momentum has become a part of
space. We attempt to visualize this by considering a universe
containing two entities. The first, a hydrogen atom, consisting
of an electron and proton. The second, a neutron. Each, as
we asserted in earlier articles, consists of two photons. We
separate these two entities by 186,000 miles, one light
second in spacetime.
Both hydrogen atom and neutron, by their existence, effect
the spacetime of the other. The effects are not identical, since
the hydrogen atom has a slightly higher effective mass than
does a neutron. Each causes the other to orbit around itself,
but the orbit of the neutron around the hydrogen atom is
slightly tighter than the orbit of the hydrogen atom around the
neutron, owing to the slightly greater effective mass of the hy
drogen atom. We ask what happens if thp hydrogen atom
should suddenly collapse to a neutron?
After collapse the hydrogen atom's effective mass has been
reduced and therefore, the effect it has on the universe,
which includes the initial neutron, is reduced. The transmis
sion of this event (hydrogen atom collapse) must travel
throughout space. In one second it reaches the original
neutron.
The original neutron receives a message that its spacetime is
less effected and thus its orbit, around the hydrogen atom,
which is now a neutron, can be opened slightly. But if the
original neutron is going to have a more open orbit, then the
new neutron must have a tighter orbit if universal angular mo
mentum is to be conserved. This can only occur if the original
neutron becomes a hydrogen atom.
What was it that traveled between the two entities at the
speed of light? The traveler was a message that spacetime
curvature was undergoing a change. We call this traveling
message, electromagnetic radiation, or we might also call
this traveling message a gravitational wave.
Article #6

PART 1:
An energy principle of equivalence was introduced on May
23rd in Article #4. It should be Kept in mind that a unified field
theory implies a principle of equivalence for energy, force,
and momentum. Eo = moC 2 and E = hf are thus not distinct
equations defining different types of energy, rather they are
different forms of the new equation E = mc-n-Df/fl where:
moC = mc/ 0
h = mc7rD/0
c = 7rDf
We also stated on May 23rd, when we defined momentum as
a pure physical entity, it was more correct to rewrite our equa
tion as E = p7rDf/0.
An adjustment is now needed in our unified field equation,
E - p7rDf/0. The equation, as has been stated often enough,
was derived by substituting the geometric statement of
velocity, 7rDf, into Einstein's equation for the rest energy of a
particle. By deriving the equation in this manner only circular
orbits were implied. However, eliptical orbits are allowed if we
write velocity as equal to orbit size times frequency of orbit. In
articles 1 and 5 we stated \ = orbit size. Therefore, it would
be more appropriate to rewrite our new energy equation with
the \ term in place of 7tD, where \ can arise from either elipti
cal or circular orbits. Our equation becomes:
E = p\f/0 = p7rDf/0 for circular orbits (A = ttD)
When this equation is written for atomic particles the p term is
the maximum particle momentum. We saw this maximum
particle momentum was given as the rest mass of a proton
times the velocity of light, pin equals the effective momen
tum of a particle and equals the proton orbital momentum
when 0 equals 1.
In the macro world the equation is still written, E = p\f/0. The
p/0 term is still effective momentum, but now of an aggregate
body consisting of many particles. In the macro world p by it
self is the maximum momentum of a body whose value is not
known, since it requires we know the size of the minimum or
bit of this aggregate body. The author feels this minimum or
bit might be given by the aggregate body's circumference,
but it may be given by some other size, such as the circum
ference of the aggregate body when its atoms are com
pressed to neutrons.
An example may clarify the situation. The energy of the earth
can be written as:

E (earth) = pWO+p a WO
Here pp Id is the effective momentum of atomic particles
