# Plaque guards '86 memories
## 
### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
For the last seven years Wade Hall
has played an essential role in one of
Stanford's oldest traditions. This is
the seventh spring that Hall, a sheet
metal worker in the University's
Operations and Maintenance depart
ment, has been in charge of making
the time capsule that goes under the
Senior Class plaque in the Inner
Quad.
While Hall has been constructing
the 15 inch-square by 5 inch-deep
stainless steel box, the Senior Class
Presidents have been busy collecting
items to fill it.
Hall and the four presidents —
Leslie Darwin, Kim Oden, Patrick
Shannon and Steve Smith — will
meet today to seal the box. The time
capsule will then be entombed, and
the class plaque dedicated and put in
place over it, at a 10:30 ceremony to
morrow morning in the Inner Quad.
The Class of '86 plaque and time
capsule will rest at the end of a long
line dating to the Class of 1892. The
first plaque, however, was actually
put down by the Class of '96. The
brainchild of Class of '96 treasurer
Robert W. Campbell, the idea for the
plaque was initially proposed to then-
University President David Starr Jor
dan in a letter from Class of' 96 mem
ber Myron A. Folsom.
"The Class of '96 is desirous of
procuring a suitable object for a
monument to be dedicated by it on
Class Day of the coming Commence
ment Week," wrote Folsom. "The
following scheme seems to us both
novel and practical: to remove one of
the square blocks of concrete in the
walk under the arcade of the Quad
rangle, and to replace it with a block
of bronze or brass. Across the face of
this block would be stamped, corner
wise, the figures '96.' "
The Class of '96 took as the loca
tion of its plaque the center square di
rectly in front of the then
uncompleted Memorial Church, with
the avowed intention, as Folsom
wrote, that each succeeding graduat
ing class would "take up a block ad
joining that of the previous class, un
til there would be a row of blocks en
tirely around the Quadrangle,
representing classes for a period of
five hundred years or more."
The next spring, accepting the
Class of '97 plaque at the front of the
Church, Jordan showed that he had

done a little block-counting,
proclaiming "In the nature of things,
when the fair year of 2517 comes, we
shall find ourselves at this point
again."
When the arcade's four other lines
of red-brown squares are filled, it will
be the year 5097, Dr. J. continued,
and when by switching to a different
colored metal for the plate, the gray
squares are filled, it will be 8297
A.D.
Eighty-three years later, at the
plaque dedication ceremony for the
Class of 1980, newly-selected Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy

showed that he has a sharper quan
titative mind (and also that he's more
of a party pooper) than Jordan. Ken
nedy corrected Jordan's math, saying
that it would actually take only 512
years for the plaques to circle the
Quad, rather than the 626 years that
his esteemed predecessor had pos
ited.
Regardless of the exact numbers,
the class plaque is clearly a tradition
that has marched steadily forward
and carried on since its beginnings in
1896. In fact, this tradition was

retroactive as weil, taking in the four classes
that graduated from Stanford before 1896.
In 1903, finding that its class monument — a
huge "95" painted on the Inner Quad pavement
near Memorial Court — had faded, the Class of
'95 added a bronze plate ahead of, though off
center of, the '96 plaque.
The Class of '92 followed suit fourteen years
later, laying its plaque as part of Commence
ment activities in 1917. That left an open
space of two blocks between '92 and '95, but
two years later the classes of '93 and '94 filled
the gap, setting down their plaques in a joint
ceremony on Alumni Day in 1919.
All those original plaques, and most since,
were made of bronze. However, during the four
years of US involvement in World War II in the
early Forties, when bronze was not available for
such frivolous civilian pursuits, the plaques were
fabricated out of a "rich, red-colored concrete
mixture," according to an article in the July
1947 issue of the Stanford Alumni Review.
No one is quite sure when a time capsule was
first added under the senior plaque. But when
workers restoring the front wall of Memorial
Church in 1981 removed the '92-'94 plaques
for safekeeping during construction, they un
earthed artifacts under each one.
The '92 plaque had been guarding a mud
encased cardboard tube containing a vellum
parchment signed in India ink by 28 members of
the Class of '92. The memorabilia underneath
the '93 and '94 plates was found to be sealed in
lead tubes. Those tubes were left unopened, so
their contents remain a mystery.
The Class of '86 is maintaining a similar mys
tery about the contents of its time capsule. Nei
ther Shannon nor Oden would divulge any spe
cific information about objects going in this
year's capsule.
Shannon said, however, that items were
solicited from any and all interested seniors,
with an eye toward gathering objects that repre
sent not only the '85-'B6 year, but the seniors'
other three years at Stanford as well.
"We've got things relevant not only to our
year, but to the era as well, and not just to Stan

ford," Shannon explained,
Oden said that items had been gathered in
four major groupings: campus-wide events, in
ternational occurrences, sports and miscel
laneous.
Time capsule items for classes in the recent
past reputedly include a Dollie boot, water from
Lake Lag, a hamburger from the Oasis (yum . . .
tasty treat!), a copy of Bruce Springsteen's
"Born in the USA" album, copies of The Daily
reporting significant campus events, a brick
from the newly-refinished Quad, acasette tape
of" A guided tour of Macintosh" and an unpaid
parking ticket.
Shannon said that as in years past, seniors will
have an opportunity to cast their student I Ds or
some other personal momento into the time
capsule cavity before the plaque is put in place.
Capsule-maker Hall doesn't know exactly
how long the stainless steel boxes will last,
saying "All I'm worried about is a hundred
years."
But according to Bob Hamrdla, assistant to
the President and a prime helper in the Univer
sity's half of the plaque placement process, the
myth that each plaque will be opened a hundred
years after its placement is just that — a myth.
Instead, each class decides for itself if and
when its time capsule will be unearthed. So far
no plaques have been removed aside from those
taken out during the Church's earthquake
proofing in 1981.
The graduating class of'B2 however, declared
that it would open its capsule on the occasion of
its fifty year reunion.
In the meantime, the plaques and time
capsules will continue to rest as reminders of
Stanford's proud past and its firm link to the
future.
As President Kennedy said in his speech at
the 1980 plaque dedication, "We get from the
stately progress of these bronze footsteps a
sense of the stabilizing influence of this great in
stitution on human culture."
Class president Oden takes a different per
spective, saying, "It's a really neat thing ... to
think that someone will stumble upon those
boxes in a hundred years or so, and have some
idea of what we were going through."
