# Plaque guards '86 memories

### CHRIS MYERS Senior staff writer 
For the last seven years Wade Hall
has played an essential role in one of
Stanford's oldest traditions. This is
the seventh spring that Hall, a sheet
metal worker in the University's
Operations and Maintenance depart
ment, has been in charge of making
the time capsule that goes under the
Senior Class plaque in the Inner
Quad.
While Hall has been constructing
the 15 inch-square by 5 inch-deep
stainless steel box, the Senior Class
Presidents have been busy collecting
items to fill it.
Hall and the four presidents —
Leslie Darwin, Kim Oden, Patrick
Shannon and Steve Smith — will
meet today to seal the box. The time
capsule will then be entombed, and
the class plaque dedicated and put in
place over it, at a 10:30 ceremony to
morrow morning in the Inner Quad.
The Class of '86 plaque and time
capsule will rest at the end of a long
line dating to the Class of 1892. The
first plaque, however, was actually
put down by the Class of '96. The
brainchild of Class of '96 treasurer
Robert W. Campbell, the idea for the
plaque was initially proposed to then-
University President David Starr Jor
dan in a letter from Class of' 96 mem
ber Myron A. Folsom.
"The Class of '96 is desirous of
procuring a suitable object for a
monument to be dedicated by it on
Class Day of the coming Commence
ment Week," wrote Folsom. "The
following scheme seems to us both
novel and practical: to remove one of
the square blocks of concrete in the
walk under the arcade of the Quad
rangle, and to replace it with a block
of bronze or brass. Across the face of
this block would be stamped, corner
wise, the figures '96.' "
The Class of '96 took as the loca
tion of its plaque the center square di
rectly in front of the then
uncompleted Memorial Church, with
the avowed intention, as Folsom
wrote, that each succeeding graduat
ing class would "take up a block ad
joining that of the previous class, un
til there would be a row of blocks en
tirely around the Quadrangle,
representing classes for a period of
five hundred years or more."
The next spring, accepting the
Class of '97 plaque at the front of the
Church, Jordan showed that he had

done a little block-counting,
proclaiming "In the nature of things,
when the fair year of 2517 comes, we
shall find ourselves at this point
again."
When the arcade's four other lines
of red-brown squares are filled, it will
be the year 5097, Dr. J. continued,
and when by switching to a different
colored metal for the plate, the gray
squares are filled, it will be 8297
A.D.
Eighty-three years later, at the
plaque dedication ceremony for the
Class of 1980, newly-selected Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy

showed that he has a sharper quan
titative mind (and also that he's more
of a party pooper) than Jordan. Ken
nedy corrected Jordan's math, saying
that it would actually take only 512
years for the plaques to circle the
Quad, rather than the 626 years that
his esteemed predecessor had pos
ited.
Regardless of the exact numbers,
the class plaque is clearly a tradition
that has marched steadily forward
and carried on since its beginnings in
1896. In fact, this tradition was
