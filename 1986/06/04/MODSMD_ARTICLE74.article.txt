Article #7

The following article will be the last in the series that began
May 2nd. In this closing article we will explore the particle
wave duality of energy and then have a short discussion of
chemistry, where we will propose how our equation,
E = pAf/0 (or E = p7rDf/0, circular orbits) can account for
spectral lines in atoms and for ionic charge.
We begin with an illustration whereby a perfectly elastic ball
is thrown at a weightless wall that is on frictionless wheels.
Behind the wall you stand unable to see the thrown ball. You
place your hands on the wall and by use of force prevent the
wall from recoiling from the force of the balls impact.
The force of the ball hitting the wall, or the energy imparted to
the wall, will depend on the balls momentum change during
impact. You could determine this momentum change, since
your force is such as to stop the wall from recoiling and to
cause the ball to change direction. You did not see the size of
the ball, or how fast it was thrown, and know nothing of the
ball's effective mass or effective velocity. You presume,
being a good student of contemporary physics, the balls mo
mentum was dependent on the product of its mass and
velocity.
Now the ball is thrown a second time at the wall. This time,
just as the ball impacts with the wall, an immovable second
wall is placed close behind the ball so that the ball rebounds
between the two walls. We make the frequency of rebound
such that you cannot distinguish between this rebounding
event and a single collision. The immovable wall is removed
1/10 second later.
The force you will need to exert per unit time, to keep your
wall stationary in this second case, will depend additionally
on the distance separating the walls (we disregard the ball's
dimensions), since this effects the number of collisions occur
ring in this interval. As the distance decreases the rebounds
increase and the force you need to exert increases propor
tionally. In trying to describe the origin of the ball's momen
tum you might continue to conclude it depends solely on the
balls mass and velocity, however, if you could peer around
the wall you would revise your hypothesis.
For a particle traveling in an orbit, undergoing constant
changes in momentum, its effective momentum similarly
depends not only on its effective velocity and mass, but on its
orbit size. Tighter orbits define particles whose effective
momentums are greater. It should be noted the particle is
described by the entire orbit, more precisely by the curvature
of space that would make a body within the orbit behave in a
particular manner. If we consider the model of a particle
trapped inside a box, it is the box we are describing as the
particle.

We now turn our attention to chemistry. To tackle this subject
we back up to Bohr Theory which was introduced in the early
part of this century. In Bohr's theory the electron was thought
to be a particle traveling in a circle (or elipse, if we include
Sommerfeld's contribution). According to Bohr Theory, the
electron could have only certain values for its angular mo
mentum, which was given by:
L = nh/27r
where
L = angular momentum
n = principle quantum number
h = Planck's constant
27r = circle circumference divided by circle diameter
Bohr Theory worked well to explain some of the spectral lines
of the hydrogen atom. Unfortunately Bohr Theory did not
define all the observed spectra. For example, between n=l
and n=2 there were other lines Bohr Theory could not ac
count for. To accommodate the spectra of more complex
atoms and even the spectra of the hydrogen atom quantum
mechanics was born.
Let us rearrange the Bohr equation above:
L = nh/27r or pr = nh/27r
p27rr = nh or h = p7rD/n
We now compare this equation with our new equation:
E = p\f/0 = p7rDf/0 for circular orbits, \ = nD
E = hf or h = E/f = p7rD/0
The equations look almost identical, but there are two distinct
differences. The first is that n and 0 are not identical, the
second concerns interpretation.
In the Bohr equation, n is a whole number whose minimum
value is 1. Bohr said n was 1 when the electron was in its
ground state orbit, \ = 3.3 x 10" B cm (r = 5.3 x 10" 9 cm).
In the new equation 6 is a whole number whose minimum
value is also 1. However, our derivation showed 0 is 1 when
the photon orbit was equal to the circumference of a proton, a
value we derived to be 1.32 x I0~ 13 cm ( r = .42 x I0" 13 cm).
When the electron is in the ground state orbit, 0 has a value of
250,000.
Why is there a discrepancy between the values of n and 0 in
Bohr's and our theory? Bohr looked at the electron and
proton as distinct entities, unrelated except for their apparent

attraction. Bohr observed the spectral lines of a hydrogen
atom and described them in terms of the possible electron or
bits. The lowest orbit became n= 1. He had no reason to
believe there was a lower orbit, his spectra didn t show it.
We derived our energy equation based on the geometry of
spacetime and fitted this geometrical expression to a proton.
We then found when we allowed the orbit of our geometrical
expression for energy to increase, from the size of a proton to
which it had been fitted, to the size of the electron orbit, that
the momentum term in our equation (pld) matched precisely
with the Bohr ground state electron orbital momentum.
While Bohr's equation, with its large unity value for n could
not account for intermediate spectral lines, our equation with
its much smaller 6 unity has no problem describing inter
mediate lines.
More importantly we differ from Bohr Theory in basic con
cept. For Bohr the electron was a particle in orbit. In the Bohr
atom one could literally pluck the electron out of its orbit.
In our theory the entire orbit describes the particle we call an
electron. More precisely, the orbit describes a spacetime
curvature (a rate change in momentum) existing at the orbit.
While we postulated calling protons and electrons photons in
different orbits, we gave further interpretation in later articles
and referred to proton and electrons as statements of
spacetime curvature. For instance, the planet Mercury orbits
the sun in 88 days, while the earth requires 365 days to com
plete its orbit. The rate change in momentum of the planet
Mercury, by reason it can complete its orbit in less time, is
greater than the rate change in momentum of planet earth.
We say spacetime is more curved in Mercury's orbit. Similarly
an electron's spacetime has a curvature that results in a par
ticular rate of change in momentum. This rate of change in
momentum is given by a photon moving in the orbit we state
to be the electron's distance from the proton field. A proton's
spacetime has greater curvature and is represented by a
photon moving in an orbit the circumference of which is the
proton.
We come now to combinations of electrons and protons. The
neutron was described by two photons in an orbit twice the
size of a proton with each photon on opposite sides of the or
bit (May 9th article). A situation that allows cancellation of the
wave patterns each produces, since each can be said to be
180 degrees out of phase with the other (wave crest meets
wave trough). This model also accounts for a neutron mass
consistent with observed values. We could have also des
cribed the neutron in terms of 2 photon orbits, each twice the
size of the proton orbit, arranged one on top of the other, but
180 degrees out of phase.
We propose all atoms and molecules possessing neutrality
require their combined wave patterns to be cancelled in a
manner similar to our neutron model. When there is not a
cancellation of wave patterns we have our concept of charge.
Charge is simply an imbalance of spacetime curvature This
imbalance can flow from one point in space to another, or it
can flow through a material. The neutrality of certain atoms
(inert atoms) and molecules results from arrangements that
balance out photon wave patterns of their electrons A model
calling for 4 quantum numbers is not required
