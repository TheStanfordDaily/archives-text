# Fun on 1982
## 
### 
In the Beginning, Don said "Let there be the Class of 1986," and there was.
Things began with a splash at Freshman Field Day during Orientation. The Band played v
music and gracious Orientation volunteers helped everyone get into the swim of things.
From swimming in water to walking on water, the fun extended to pranks like the one pulled"
some Dixie cups in a Trancos hallway. The 1983 edition of Gaieties hit paydirt with a lampo<
"The Play" (when in doubt signal touchdown), and the Viennese Ball brought sweetness and
and loads of class to the interminable grind of winter quarter.
Spring quarter opened with Aqua Follies: the Band at yet another body of water, tooting ne
the lapping surf of Lake Lag and adventurous white-water rafters getting their feet wet in a h
contested race.
Another football season brought some vociferous crowd support and more pranks, with Fi
Junipero Serra donning a Stanford helmet and pointing the way to victory over the heathen sen
Berkeley.
Great times were had by all at Senior Pub Nights, and the Big Game Bonfire came back in a I
of glory to light the way to Commencement.
