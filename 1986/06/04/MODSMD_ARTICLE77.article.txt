# Seniors' social calendar was busy in '85-'86
## 
### STACEY ATTANASIO Staff writer 
Senior year — the last chance for
fun in the sun at Stanford. And this
year, the senior class presidents
worked hard to organize that fun.
The Class of '86 certainly enjoyed
a banner year — the list of activities is
nearly endless: Disorientation Day.
Casino Night. Camping in the Sierras.
The Senior Formal. Pub Nights. A
"Progressive" Pub Night. And on and
on. .. .
If planning all these activities
sounds like a lot of work, it was. Steve
Smith, a senior class president, said it
was "more work than he thought it
would be." But he added that he
"enjoyed every minute of it"and said
his only regret was that he was not
available for more input from the
class.
Nevertheless, the class presidents
showed some innovation this year,
coupling the traditional stand-bys
with new ideas, like the Progressive
Pub Night in San Francisco.
And most seniors agreed that the
senior activities were very enjoyable
this year; many saw them as the "last
chance" to socialize with friends.
Dave Lippeatt said he participated
in class activities because he came to
"a realization that these are people
we may never see again and things we
may no longer have the chance to
do."
Indeed, Leslie Talmadge aptly des
cribed this state of mind as "the
senior scramble." This year's senior
class combined two distinct groups.
On the one hand were those who
struggled to finish their 180 units,
worked hard to complete their theses
(or tragically lost them forever to
computer technology), took part in
cut-throat bidding for interviews at
the CPPC, and sent out applications

and resumes. And then there were
those who had completed all these
chores and were totally free to enjoy
their last few months.
But what they all had in common
was the easily accessible equally at
tractive off-campus alternative:
weekly Senior Pub Nights. This Stan
ford ritual even lured students out
from under the winter doldrums and
proved particularly popular spring
quarter, when the crowd overflow of
ten created "Counter Pub Nights" at
other bars. And then there was the
Progressive Pub Night.
Smith called the Progressive Pub
Night "a very successful event. Over
75 seniors piled into buses to bar-hop
on Union Street, and dance after
wards at the I-Beam."
Fall quarter saw some dissatisfac
tion of eager seniors revved up to go
with no way to know where. (As one
senior asked, "Whatever happened to
senior newsletters?") However, the
Pub Night die-hards surpassed
seemingly insurmountable obstacles
to find Pub Night, and the advertising
improved somewhat.
Others, like Anna Kamdar, wished
there were more than Pub Nights to
look for."Pub nights are fine to get to
see everyone, but not when they are
the only weekly event. Activities such
as beach trips and sports days would
have thrown people together and let
them get to know new people on a
more casual basis," she said.
The very first event, Senior Dis
orientation Day, also suffered from
lack of advertising — or perhaps the
idea of being simultaneously dis
oriented on Wilbur Field and dis
tracted by the tunes of the Distrac
tions was too much too soon for the
new breed of senior.
Attendance quickly rose for such
annual favorites as the Mausoleum

Party and Casino Night.
The Mausoleum Party maintained
all of its rather morbid charm of
partying around the sleeping Stan
fords, while rubbing elbows with doz
ens of Paly-kids, donning bizarre
costumes, and the added classy touch
of champagne coolers.
Casino night attracted about 800
high rollers, ready to gamble away

their chips in the hope of winning
some prizes.
The class decided to relocate this
event to the Hyatt Palo Alto, a move
which allowed about 250 more
seniors to enjoy gambling with faculty
dealers. "Gambling and dancing was
so much fun," said Maureen Morran,
"that the night was over before I
knew it!"

Ticket sales boomed once again for
the Senior Formal, which took place
May 15 at the Grand Ballroom of the
Saint Francis Hotel in San Francisco
and featured the music of Big Bang
Beat.
Leslie Darwin, one of the class
presidents, said she was "happy to see
that 800 people attended. It was great
to see the class come together."
Valerie Waken agreed. "Seeing so
many people from our class together
made me realize how many great
people are in our class and how close
I feel to so many of them."
Of the more interesting outfits in
this crowded room was the temporary
trade of evening gown and tux be
tween John Tierney and Stephanie
Zittin. When asked to give a reason
for the switch, Tierney replied that
"someone had to."
Lisa Segre summed up all the fa
vorable reports. "[Big Bang Beat]
was amazing and I had a great time
dancing with my friends."
Tickets almost sold out for Senior
Weekend and the 140 happy campers
would certainly agree that the rest of
the class missed out.
Angel Vazquez, who wasn't able to
attend, said, "I wish we could have
had more events like the Sierra
weekend. Hiking together, and ap
preciating the beauty of the scenery
gives people a chance to share some
thing and really get to know each
other on another level."
The Stanford Sierra Camp pro
vided an idyllic haven to commune
with nature and friends. The campers
were set loose all day to hike, canoe
and kayak, reuniting for evening ac
tivities, highlighted by a talent show
of unique senior "talent."
Of course, roughing it in the Sierras
had its dangers, such as a capsize in
icy waters ("they never warned us
that it would be so cold," shivered

Sheila Kelly), a slight knee injury to
Pam Blom (the "strongest woman in
the world"), and three deformed
faces of "grape stuffers," led by
Charlie Cosovich.
But with the dangers came the
wonders of sitting around a campfire,
organized by Stef Bini, with about 50
classmates, singing and swaying to
John Magnus on guitar. The gather
ing was enjoyed by all.
As the year winded down, some
seniors expressed the hope that the
class could hve one final "event." As
Chip Overstreet put it, "After
graduation, they should have a Senior
Week — it would be a party."
Late spring quarter, senior class
presidents were in the process of
doing just that. Smith mentioned
plans for a "Senior Convocation,"
which he said would act as "a last
reunion with freshman dormmates,
and chance to come together as a
class."
Before graduation, there will also
be the traditional Class Day and
Night before events, which seniors
may attend with their families.
One event which the presidents
had conceived of in their campaign,
the Senior Boat Party, was unfortun
ately impossible due to finances. But
the seniors seem to have enjoyed all
of the other events that took place
this year.
Of course, in every group, there are
diverse likes and dislikes. As Squeaky
Payer said, "Senior Class activities'? I
haven't gone to any. . .
But there seems to be hope for
some, like Jenny Fenton, who said a
few weeks back, "Pub Nights are
picking up — I'm going now."
Most seniors participated in activi
ties to some degree, and many would
probably agree with Craig Copps,
who called the activities "great —
tons of fun."
