# Dry Commencement urged
## 
### 
Commencement organizers have asked that students
not bring alcohol to the graduation exercises on June
15 in Stanford Stadium.
Patrick Shannon, one of the four Senior Class Presi
dents, first proposed the idea last year. "It's not a
crusade," he said. "I wanted to talk about it and see
what we could do to have Commencement go more
smoothly.
"We want to protect the integrity of Commence
ment and make it a more reflective event," Shanon
added.
In a letter sent to seniors this week. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy echoed Shanon's concerns, call
ing graduation "the most special day of the academic
year."
Commencement is "even more meaningful to others

— parents, friends, loved ones — than it is to you,"
Kennedy wrote. "In the event, and in you, they are
looking for some reflection of the joy and pride they
feel."
Officials will ask seniors to deposit champagne
bottles and other alcoholic beverages in boxes at
entrances to the stadium. Students will be able to pick
up bottles after the ceremony.
In the first six days tickets for the event were
available, 25,000 tickets were given out to hear Stan
ford graduate Ted Koppel, host of ABC's "Nightline"
deliver the Commencement address.
Tickets, which are free, are available 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. this week and next week on the patio behind the
Tresidder ticket office. There is no limit on the number
of tickets a graduating student is entitled to.
