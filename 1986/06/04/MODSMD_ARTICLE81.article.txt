# A
						guide to good eats on the Peninsula
## 
### 
Early in the morning
Morning eaters are lucky here —
Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a ple
thora of good restaurants that spe
cialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (150 Middlefield Rd., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blitzes and fruit pancakes and
the usual salads and sandwiches, plus
ever-changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday, ex
pect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in Palo
Alto: 4224 El Camino Real and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family operation
with more branches around the
peninsula. Hobee's follows more
traditional American breakfast lines
— sausage, eggs, ham — but isn't
lacking for fresh-squeezed juices,
fruit and other California trimmings,
and it has a truly addictive coffee
cake that comes with most of the
breakfasts. Both Hobee's and Late
for the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Califor
nia Ave., Palo Alto) has a small
menu, spotty service (semi-cafeteria
style) and the ambiance of a butcher
shop, but it serves great breakfasts
(try the apple pancaJces or a
(ham/swiss/apple omelette) at
relatively low prices.

Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which has delicious omelettes.
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, but there are
such things as old standards.
Half the people in Ramona's (541
Ramona St., Palo Alto) on any given
weekend night will be from Stanford;
the crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area, while
those who want to be different chew
on calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad bar
retains only a shade of its former
glory.
Down the street at the Good Earth
Restaurant (185 University Ave.,
Palo Alto), you'll find a different,
slightly older Stanford crowd eating
chic health food. The iced tea at this
time of year is particularly refreshing.
Of course, "hangouts" in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
few of those, too.
The Dutch Goose (3567 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park), a func
tional sort of place where it's SRO on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
(241 El Camino Real, Menlo Park), a
downright ugly place that has been

witness to untold decades of Stanford
history. One thing to know: refer to
the two establishments as "The 'O' "
and"The Goose," respectively.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffett Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough or look enough like Stanford
student. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St. Palo

Alto) into a Stanford hangout of the
Pub Night variety, but it doesn't seem
to have fully caught on. A morning
alternative: the weekend brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity (456 University
Ave., Palo Alto), especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies, as it is once a week for the
next month or so.
Different strokes for different folks
It's the familiar refrain: How about

Chinese? Why don't we try Mexican?
And around here it's easy to fall into,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are as
bad as you'd expect; here are a few
good ones:
Generations of Stanfordites have
fallen in love with the pork at
ChefChu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always-crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a big
reputation. The cuisine here is Szec
huan/Hunan, albeit not too spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor — it looks like
a cross between a Chinese resteraunt
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good
Mexican restaurant when the Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded a few years
back. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required.
Ejtrellita (971 North San Antonio
Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it used to
be, but it still has great chimichangas.
There are two passable family-style
Mexican joints in Menlo Park, La

Luna Mexican Cctfe (1137 Chestnut
St.) and Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If
you don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El Cal
deron (699 EI Calderon Ave., Moun
tain View), which is hidden away in a
small shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
Vive La France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local French res
taurant that comes close to meeting
the bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal, but still affor
dable, are Pear Williams Restaurant
Francois (150 Middlefield Rd.,
Menlo Park), which is named for its
dessert specialty, and Chez Louis
(4170 El Camino Real, Palo Alto),
virtually an institution. Most of the
other French restaurants nearby suf
fer from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service or
just plain bad food.
Das food
The only real German restaurant
anywhere near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los Altos).
Meals are prepared rather indif
ferently, but if you just have to have
some weinerschnitzel with red
cabbage and potato pancakes, this is
the place to go.
