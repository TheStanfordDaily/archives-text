# A 						guide to good eats on the Peninsula
## 
### 
Early in the morning
Morning eaters are lucky here —
Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a ple
thora of good restaurants that spe
cialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (150 Middlefield Rd., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blitzes and fruit pancakes and
the usual salads and sandwiches, plus
ever-changing desserts. If you go on a
weekend, particularly a Sunday, ex
pect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in Palo
Alto: 4224 El Camino Real and
Town and Country Village, across
from the Stadium), a family operation
with more branches around the
peninsula. Hobee's follows more
traditional American breakfast lines
— sausage, eggs, ham — but isn't
lacking for fresh-squeezed juices,
fruit and other California trimmings,
and it has a truly addictive coffee
cake that comes with most of the
breakfasts. Both Hobee's and Late
for the Train provide free coffee for
waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Califor
nia Ave., Palo Alto) has a small
menu, spotty service (semi-cafeteria
style) and the ambiance of a butcher
shop, but it serves great breakfasts
(try the apple pancaJces or a
(ham/swiss/apple omelette) at
relatively low prices.

Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities — Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which has delicious omelettes.
Where the Cardinal flocks
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, but there are
such things as old standards.
Half the people in Ramona's (541
Ramona St., Palo Alto) on any given
weekend night will be from Stanford;
the crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area, while
those who want to be different chew
on calzones or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad bar
retains only a shade of its former
glory.
Down the street at the Good Earth
Restaurant (185 University Ave.,
Palo Alto), you'll find a different,
slightly older Stanford crowd eating
chic health food. The iced tea at this
time of year is particularly refreshing.
Of course, "hangouts" in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
few of those, too.
The Dutch Goose (3567 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park), a func
tional sort of place where it's SRO on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
(241 El Camino Real, Menlo Park), a
downright ugly place that has been

witness to untold decades of Stanford
history. One thing to know: refer to
the two establishments as "The 'O' "
and"The Goose," respectively.
If you'd like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffett Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough or look enough like Stanford
student. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St. Palo

Alto) into a Stanford hangout of the
Pub Night variety, but it doesn't seem
to have fully caught on. A morning
alternative: the weekend brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity (456 University
Ave., Palo Alto), especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies, as it is once a week for the
next month or so.
Different strokes for different folks
It's the familiar refrain: How about

Chinese? Why don't we try Mexican?
And around here it's easy to fall into,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are as
bad as you'd expect; here are a few
good ones:
Generations of Stanfordites have
fallen in love with the pork at
ChefChu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always-crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a big
reputation. The cuisine here is Szec
huan/Hunan, albeit not too spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor — it looks like
a cross between a Chinese resteraunt
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good
Mexican restaurant when the Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded a few years
back. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required.
Ejtrellita (971 North San Antonio
Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it used to
be, but it still has great chimichangas.
There are two passable family-style
Mexican joints in Menlo Park, La

Luna Mexican Cctfe (1137 Chestnut
St.) and Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If
you don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El Cal
deron (699 EI Calderon Ave., Moun
tain View), which is hidden away in a
small shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.
Vive La France!
Without going into too much
detail, there's one local French res
taurant that comes close to meeting
the bistro ideal (good food, relatively
low prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park). Some
what more formal, but still affor
dable, are Pear Williams Restaurant
Francois (150 Middlefield Rd.,
Menlo Park), which is named for its
dessert specialty, and Chez Louis
(4170 El Camino Real, Palo Alto),
virtually an institution. Most of the
other French restaurants nearby suf
fer from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service or
just plain bad food.
Das food
The only real German restaurant
anywhere near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los Altos).
Meals are prepared rather indif
ferently, but if you just have to have
some weinerschnitzel with red
cabbage and potato pancakes, this is
the place to go.

Burrito babies
Rosita's Taqueria (171 A sth Ave.,
Redwood City) occupies a storefront
in an uninviting part of Redwood City
but makes the the only authentic
burritos-to-go in the area.These are
big sloppy things that can't be eaten
while driving a car, and Rosita's has a
wide variety, including pork and beef
in several sauces, steak, chicken,
sausage and tongue. Rosita's also has
a good selection of Mexican beers
and soft drinks — you haven't lived
until you've had a Boing soda.
Pizza heaven
Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi, Too
(939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 45- to 75-minute waits
on weekends, which can fly by if a
large group of people go and drink
while waiting (if you look 21, you'll
be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in). Try
the fresh tomato and garlic pizza, a
house specialty, or the ever-popular
stromboli or Hawaiian. Avoid the
Italian dinners, which are often
dreadful. A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's, which has decent New
York style (i.e. heavy and spicy)

pizza and slightly shorter waits, and is
closer to campus. Honorable mention
goes to the pizza with barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place of tomato sauce)
at Jose's (2275 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), and the pizza with almost any
thing on it at Applewood Inn (1001
El Camino Real, Menlo Park).
Very early in the morning
There used to be a wealth of places
where you could go at 2 a.m. — or 4
a.m. or 6 a.m. — with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify yourself in an emotional crisis, or
by yourself to study and mainline
some caffeine.
Then Stickney's cut back to mid
night and then became a trendy
yuppie hangout and Luv's went to 24
hours on weekends only and eventu
ally became a singles pickup joint. In
the old days, going to Denny's or
Lyons didn't even cross your mind;
now they're all that's left.
Closer (by about 100 yards) and
friendlier is Denny's (426 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto). Denny's is also
cheaper that Lyons, has food that's at
least as good or better, tackier vinyl
and that all-star late-night waitress,
Ova.
So why go to Lyons (4298 El
Camino Real, Los Atos) at all? Be
cause sometimes you need a change.
Lyons is darker, the waitresses are
younger. And if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 a.m. and get

really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lion Burger. The patty melt
is also pretty neat.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to 24-hour service about two
years ago. The Creamery has pretty
mediocre greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are good (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus — within biking range, even.
Plus you can call your friends and
loved ones on the phones supplied to
each booth.
I scream for you
Everyone loves ice cream, to be
sure, but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is practically drowning
in the stuff. Within a quick drive of
campus are a Haagen-Dazs (Stanford
Barn, 700 Welch Rd.), two
Swenson's (440 University Ave., Palo
Alto and 1350 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), Blatz Folded Ice Cream
(101 California Ave., Palo Alto),
Double Rainbow (1083 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), the Peninsula
Creamery (566 Emerson St., Palo
Alto), Rick's Rather Rich Ice Cream
(Charleston at Middlefield, Palo
Alto), Edy's (73 Town and Country
Village, Palo Alto) and the Univer
sity Creamery.
Then there are these Italian ice
cream shops: Gelato La Romanina

(1700 El Camino Real, Menlo Park),
Tempo Gelato (2245 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto), Gelato Classico
(437 Emerson St., Palo Alto) and
Bravo Fono (99 Stanford Shopping
Center). Two or three more have
probably opened up since you've
started reading this.
With such a wide variety to choose
from, you might sample everything
and then decide. Two things to keep
in mind: the ice cream at the Penin
sula Creamery is smooth, rich and
delicious, and the home-made waffle
cones at Blatz are not to be missed.
Spirits in the night
There are as many differnt kinds of
bars as there are drinkers, and the
most popular ones — the Goose and
the O — are treated elsewhere in this
article. We're concerned here with
the bar as a comfortable environment
in which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment in which to
get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one
of the nicest places in which to sit
around in Palo Alto. The bar at
Mama's (379 Stanford Shopping
Center) is a bit out of the way, but it
has a certain hushed elegance that
makes it attractive. Henry's (482
University Ave., Palo Alto), is hot
and crowded once the dinner cus
tomers clear out, but there's no one

on the make; just lots of successful
young Palo Altans enjoying their suc
cess in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene,"
but isn't a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity. Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard
and lots of Paly and Gunn High
punks and assorted young people
play out in the street in front and the
alley behind. It's noisy and crowded
and uncomfortable on the weekends,
but the people-watching is great. If
you're looking for something a little
more staid, try the bar at the rear of
the London House (630 Ramona St.,
Palo Alto), a loving recreation of an
English pub where you can get most
any British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park (27
University Ave., Palo Alto) is in one
of the approved styles: big, open,
white-paneled spaces, wood floor,
brass railings everywhere. The food
ranges from mediocre to bad (except
for the barbecued meats; be sure to
order something from the grill, espe
cially the ribs), but what does it mat
ter when you can get potato skins and
eight wines by the glass? Another
style is represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St., Palo Alto), which
is all glass and bleached wood and ex
pensive (but surprisingly good) pastas

and seafood dishes.
Along with these younger restau
rants, a couple of established Palo
Alto restaurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse, one of Palo
Alto's prettiest places to eat and
drink, is taken over by the young
come dinner hour, and Henry's is a
favorite with the local advertis
ing/design community that lives off
Silicon Valley.
Avoid at all costs.
Sometime while you're here some
one will suggest going to one of these
restaurants. Politely tell him/her
you'd rather undergo root canal
work.
Dinah's Shack (4629 El Camino
Road, Palo Alto) is one of those inex
plicably popular restaurants — I can
see why little old ladies go there, but
why in God's name would anyone
else want to spend upwards of $10 for
a lousy buffet and the chance to hear
"Feelings" played on the harp? Ecco
Ristorante (4290 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), right across the street in
the Hyatt Palo Alto, may be the worst
Italian restaurant in the world, and
the green carpet doesn't help.
(Beware restaurants with
idiosyncratic spelling in their names).
King Chuan (75 Town and Country
Village, Palo Alto) had at last count
three laudatory Stanford Daily
reviews posted in its window. Don't
believe a word of them.
