# Three years on the Farm
## 
### 
Of course, this past year wasn't the
only busy one on the Farm. The other
three years had their share of momen
tous happenings, too: Stanford
withstood 35 inches of rain, held a
party for a monarch, was used as a cam
paign stop for U.S. Presidential candi
dates and hosted the Superbowl,
among other things.
And we also beat Cal.
September:
1984: During Orientation Weekend,
Stanford beats San Jose State 28-27;
New Coach Jack Elway's first win —
over the team he'd coached the year
before.
1983: Paul Wiggin's Card loses to
John Elway's SJS Spartans in the Ori
entation Weekend game. Meyer Li
brary tries to cut down its hours, but

students protest and it restores its usual
hours. Sally Ride, holder of four Stan
ford degrees, becomes the first woman
to enter space.
1982: Students arrive on campus to a
strike that will last four weeks.
Lawns get brown, trash is piled high,
food service is nonexistent. A Stanford
junior is murdered near Frenchman's
Hill in the "Faculty Ghetto." The
suspect is later caught — after a
nationwide search — and convicted.
One-hundred-eighty students move
into new undergraduate housing in
Governor's Corner. Bike lanes are
painted all around the Quad and White
Plaza.
October:
1984: Students all over campus watch
debates between President Ronald

Reagan and former Vice President
Walter Mondale. "Conservative
feminist" Phyllis Schafly speaks at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Incumbent Ed
Zschau and Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy, who is running against Zschau
in the race for the 12th Congressional
district, debate in Kresge Auditorium.
Walter Mondale's campaign makes a
stop at Stanford. The United Stanford
Workers win the right to represent
Stanford workers.
1983: Many major construction proj
ects are finished; the Braun Music Cen
ter, the Ralph and Marion Falk Car
diovascular Research Center and the
Center for Integrated Systems are all
completed. Univesity officials haggle
over Quad renovation plans and Near
West development plans. "Newsweek
On Campus" calls Law School Prof.
John Kaplan's criminal law class "the
easiest five credits a Stanford student
can earn."
1982: Nine-thousand-five-hundred
Deadheads crowd Frost for the first
campus concert in three years. Resi
dents of Trancos flee after the walls
start to dilate.
November:
1984: Rodin's "Gates of Hell" come
to Stanford and work begins on the
B.G. Cantor Sculpture Garden. The
women's volleyball team is ranked first
in the nation. Pranksters fill a Trancos
hallway with paper cups of water. Sally
1 Ride speaks at Kresge. On election
day, President Reagan wins 59 percent
of the poular vote and all states except
Minnesota. Stanford votes in favor of
Mondale, though. Zschau wins 64 per
cent of the 12th District vote. During
Big Game Week, a Cal fraternity
dumps 50 blue and gold mice in Meyer.
Stanford wins Big Game 27-10.
1983: The Cardinal loses Big Game.
A "screwed" teddy bear is palced in
lieu of the Axe in Tresidder. "U.S.
News and World Report" takes a poll
and finds Stanford at the top of the col
legiate world.
1982: In the famous Big Game fiasco,
Stanford is robbed of a 20-19 win on


In September 1982, the Class of '86 arrives on the Farm amid a United Stanford Workers union strike. During the
month-long strike, the longest in Stanford history, some essential services grind to a halt, but students on Univer
sity meal plans enjoy a weekly cash rebate to facilitate off-campus eating.


As part of a 1983 visit to the United States, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
