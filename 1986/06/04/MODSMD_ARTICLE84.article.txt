# Trivial tidbits from a terrific tradition

### 
The history of the University's Commencement exer
cises may serve no real purpose other than being great
material for a Stanford trivia bowl. But what's the differ
ence? Go ahead — read on and bone up on the Univer
sity's Commencement history. . . .
Okay, where were most C o m me nee me nts held prior to
1938? Clue: Its small size became a problem as enrollment
grew.
Memorial Church. From 1938 until 1983 Stanford held
Commencement in Frost Ampitheater; in 1984, the cere
mony was held at Sunken Diamond, and last year Com
mencement was held at Stanford Stadium.
Where was the first Commencement held?
Roble Gym. According to Fred Glover, Class of' 33 and
former executive assistant to the University president,
evergreens and flowers decorated what was then a tempo
rary frame building.
Who was the speaker in 1935, when Commencement
was held in the Stadium? Clue: He was a member of the

first class that graduated from Stanford, and his wife -also
a Stanford graduate - was named Lou Henry. While a stu
dent here, this speaker forgot to bring the football to the
first Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon, Class of '28, 50-year resi
dent of the white house with the roses next to the Betas,
and Commencement marshal from 1934-72, estimated
that more than 15,000 attended the Hoover speech in the
90,000 capacity arena. "A lot left," he said, after Hoover
gave his speech.
According to Donald Winbigler, former registrar, aca
demic secretary and dean of students for 17 years, "It was
a very good talk. It was brief and to the point." Inciden
tally, Winbigler attended every Commencement from
1940-1975.
In the late '70s and early '80s, there was always a
chronic shortage of Commencenent tickets. Why was the
University so reluctant to hold Commencement exercises in
the Stadium?

University officials maintained the Stadium's atmos
phere was wrong for Commencement. "It (the Stadium)
was too big a place," Bacon said. Frost Amphitheater, on
the other hand was loved by faculty and students alike;
Bacon called it the "ideal place."
In 1984, however, officials relented and decided to try
Sunken Diamond as a Commencement site. When that
was deemed too small, some faculty and students consid
ered holding the ceremony in the Oval; eventually,
though, Stanford Stadium got the nod because of its vir
tually unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate School of Business holds its
ceremony in Frost.
How difficult um it to obtain Commencement tickets
before the move to the Stadium?
Very difficult, according to Bacon. Thousands of ticket
requests were routinely denied each year.
Has Commencement ever been rained out?
Amazingly, it never has.

Have students always received their diplomas at depart
ment ceremonies?
No. Up until about 12 years ago — during Richard
Lyman's presidency — the University president awarded
the diplomas in the large ceremony. But the ceremony
grew too long.
Historical Society President Ray Lyman Wilbur, Jr.,
Class of '33 and son of third University President Wilbur
(1916-43), said his father spoke at every Commencement
and personally gave every graduating student his diploma.
According to Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry professor
here for 36 years, the ceremony became cumbersome.
"We all fried in Frost Amphitheater," he said. "The pres
ent arrangement is much better. It no longer looks like an
assembly line. . . . We have more intimate ceremonies."
He added, "there were many mistakes in the old days."
For example, students occasionally received the wrong
diplomas. "People were swapping them around,"
Hutchinson said.

After vigorous debate, University officials decide to hold Commencement in Stanford Stadium, citing space
and security problems in Frost Amphitheater, home to graduation ceremonies for the previous half-century.
