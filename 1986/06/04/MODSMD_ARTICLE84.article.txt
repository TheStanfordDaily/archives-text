# Trivial tidbits from a terrific tradition
## 
### 
The history of the University's Commencement exer
cises may serve no real purpose other than being great
material for a Stanford trivia bowl. But what's the differ
ence? Go ahead — read on and bone up on the Univer
sity's Commencement history. . . .
Okay, where were most C o m me nee me nts held prior to
1938? Clue: Its small size became a problem as enrollment
grew.
Memorial Church. From 1938 until 1983 Stanford held
Commencement in Frost Ampitheater; in 1984, the cere
mony was held at Sunken Diamond, and last year Com
mencement was held at Stanford Stadium.
Where was the first Commencement held?
Roble Gym. According to Fred Glover, Class of' 33 and
former executive assistant to the University president,
evergreens and flowers decorated what was then a tempo
rary frame building.
Who was the speaker in 1935, when Commencement
was held in the Stadium? Clue: He was a member of the

first class that graduated from Stanford, and his wife -also
a Stanford graduate - was named Lou Henry. While a stu
dent here, this speaker forgot to bring the football to the
first Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon, Class of '28, 50-year resi
dent of the white house with the roses next to the Betas,
and Commencement marshal from 1934-72, estimated
that more than 15,000 attended the Hoover speech in the
90,000 capacity arena. "A lot left," he said, after Hoover
gave his speech.
According to Donald Winbigler, former registrar, aca
demic secretary and dean of students for 17 years, "It was
a very good talk. It was brief and to the point." Inciden
tally, Winbigler attended every Commencement from
1940-1975.
In the late '70s and early '80s, there was always a
chronic shortage of Commencenent tickets. Why was the
University so reluctant to hold Commencement exercises in
the Stadium?

University officials maintained the Stadium's atmos
phere was wrong for Commencement. "It (the Stadium)
was too big a place," Bacon said. Frost Amphitheater, on
the other hand was loved by faculty and students alike;
Bacon called it the "ideal place."
In 1984, however, officials relented and decided to try
Sunken Diamond as a Commencement site. When that
was deemed too small, some faculty and students consid
ered holding the ceremony in the Oval; eventually,
though, Stanford Stadium got the nod because of its vir
tually unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate School of Business holds its
ceremony in Frost.
How difficult um it to obtain Commencement tickets
before the move to the Stadium?
Very difficult, according to Bacon. Thousands of ticket
requests were routinely denied each year.
Has Commencement ever been rained out?
Amazingly, it never has.

Have students always received their diplomas at depart
ment ceremonies?
No. Up until about 12 years ago — during Richard
Lyman's presidency — the University president awarded
the diplomas in the large ceremony. But the ceremony
grew too long.
Historical Society President Ray Lyman Wilbur, Jr.,
Class of '33 and son of third University President Wilbur
(1916-43), said his father spoke at every Commencement
and personally gave every graduating student his diploma.
According to Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry professor
here for 36 years, the ceremony became cumbersome.
"We all fried in Frost Amphitheater," he said. "The pres
ent arrangement is much better. It no longer looks like an
assembly line. . . . We have more intimate ceremonies."
He added, "there were many mistakes in the old days."
For example, students occasionally received the wrong
diplomas. "People were swapping them around,"
Hutchinson said.

Today's Commencement is only the second to be held in Stanford Stadium since this graduation ceremony in
1935.

After vigorous debate, University officials decide to hold Commencement in Stanford Stadium, citing space
and security problems in Frost Amphitheater, home to graduation ceremonies for the previous half-century.
The registrar and the academic sec
retary gave the diplomas to the Uni
versity president. For many years stu
dents told their names — or
sometimes fictitious names — to
"readers." As a result, the name of
Warren G. Wonka, a fictitious
campus mischief-maker similar to
World War ll's Kilroy, was called one
Commencement.

Has the University ever enforced a
strict time limit on speeches?
No. But someone once gave an
hour-long speech. Former marshal
Bacon — whose father was a member
of the Class of '02 — said, "I won't
say who."
Did professors and students always
wear robes at Commencement?
No. According to Glover, the
entire class did not wear caps and
gowns until 1906. Students ap
parently considered the custom

"medieval." In 1899 a female student
started the cap and gown movement,
ordering herself and other women
caps and gowns.
Where was Commencement held
1906-14, when the earthquake
damaged Memorial Church?
Birge Clark, Class of '14, said his
Commencement was held in the
Auditorium (also called the Assem
bly Hall) which currently houses the
Communications Department and
formerly housed the Business School.
A class picture was taken in the Inner
Quad, however, which has led some
to think Commencement was held in
the Quad.
Glover added that in 1906 the Uni
versity deferred Commencement un
til September 15.
Has a live band always provided the
music for the ceremony?
No. Prior to 1906, organ music was
used. Before the late '40s, organ
music was piped into the Amphithea
ter from Memorial Church. Then
after Music Prof. Herber Nanney
came here as University organist in
1947, he played a rented electric or
gan in the Amphitheater. "They
decided it was easier if I had eyeball
contact," he said.
How did The Daily treat Com
mencement?
Well, in 1941 — back when a
year's tuition was $345 — The Daily
printed the names of everyone who
graduated with distinction. That same
year class orators — along with Uni
versity President John Branner —
gave speeches at Commencement.
Back then The Daily printed the
full text of the main speech, ap
parently always given by a top Uni
versity official, in the Commence
ment issues.
Who designed the Commencement
flags?
Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry pro
fessor here for 36 years, designed

them.
The banners used in the Stadium to
cover up the empty seats on the east
side of the Stadium are emblazoned
with the University's Centennial logo.
Have most Commencement
speakers been political figures?
Contrary to recent popular belief,
the majority of Commencement
speakers are not political figures.
University presidents (both of Stan
ford and of other universities), partic
ularly Wilbur, have been the most
"prolific" speakers. Other speakers
have included a secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, a former
secretary of Labor and a UC-
Berkeley chancellor.
Political speakers have included
Watergate Special Prosecutor Ar
chibald Cox in 1974 (three months
before then President Richard Nixon
resigned), U.N. Ambassador Daniel
Patrick Moynihan in 1975, U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young in 1979,
Deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in 1981, Sandra Day
O'Connor in 1982, Secretary of State
George Schultz in 1983 and New
York Governor Mario Cuomo last
year.
And the speeches have not always
been serious. In 1967, John Fischer,
editor-in-chief of Harper's maga
zine, included in his "four choices"
for graduating students "dropping
out" and "trying to change the world
gradually."
Are disruptions common?
The silent protestors in 1983 were
not the first to "disrupt" the generally
sedate — except for the champagne
— Commencement exercises. Bacon
said minor distractions are the rule:
"There usually was a dog in Frost
Amphitheater that would dash across
the stage."
When the conservative Moynihan
spoke in 1975, many walked out to
protest his selection as U.N. Ambas
sador.

Has the Commencement speaker se
lection process changed?
According to Glover, who should
know, yes. Student involvement did
not really begin until the late '60s.
"This long selection process is in the
last 15 years," he said. Student com
mittees are relatively new.
Has the Band always rushed up on
stage after the ceremony?
No. It remains to be seen if this
event — which has only happened a
few times, according to Music Prof.

Art Barnes, will become yet another
in a long line of Stanford Commence
ment traditions.
Who designed the stage used in
Commencement exercises in the
stadium?
Greg Lynch of the Stanford Art
Department. According to Nan
Bentley, assistant director of Uni
verity Events and Services, the ma
terial for decorations and the labor
for their installation costs the Univer
sity more than $200,000.

From 1938 until 1983, Stanford's Commencement execises were held in
Frost Ampitheater. Some students and faculty protested the decision to
move from Frost in 1984.
