SELF-DEFENSE
FOR WOMEN
SUMMER 1986
SWOPSII74A-B
Open letter to those women who were planning or had hoped
to enroll in SWOPSI 174 A OR 1748 (Issues in Self-Defense for
Women, Beninning and Intermediate) Summer Quarter 1986:
Due to serious organizational problems, these classes have been
cancelled for summer session only. They will be restructured,
but will continue to operate under the philosophy of consensual
decision making and cooperative learning.
Priorities for space in the now-cancelled classes (given to
women who were unable to enroll in previous quarters) will be
honored Fall quarter 1986. Other women interested in taking
these classes are encouraged to contact the SWOPSI office at the
beginning of the Fall quarter for information regarding class
times and meeting places.
We extend sincere apologies to those women whose only
opportunity to take these classes was this summer.
