# O'Neill foils Reagan plan for House contra speech
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yes
terday asked for an opportunity to address the
House to make a personal appeal for aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels, but Speaker "Tip"
O'Neill, Jr. (D-Mass.) rejected it as an
"unorthodox procedure."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
Reagan was "deeply disappointed" by
O'Neill's refusal of his request to address the
House today, just one day before that chamber
is scheduled to vote on the proposed $100 mil
lion in aid for the rebels, known as contras.
Tomorrow's vote on the issue is expected to be
extremely close.
O'Neill, a bitter foe of contra aid, said in a

written statement that an address by a presi
dent to one chamber of Congress was unprece
dented in peacetime. He said he offered
Reagan an opportunity to appear before a joint
session of Congress, arguing that it would be
more appropriate because the Senate must
also act on the aid request if it passes the
House.
But the White House, without explanation,
turned down that offer, though O'Neill said it
remained open. Officials said the text of
Reagan's speech would be sent to each mem
ber of the House instead.
"Having the president appear before only
one house to lobby for a legislative proposal

would be unprecedented," O'Neill said. "The
only justification for such an unorthodox pro
cedure would be if the president would use the
occasion to participate in an open dialogue
with members of the body. A formal address
should properly be made before a joint ses
sion."
The exchange was indicative of the intense
emotion that O'Neill and Reagan frequently
have demonstrated on opposite sides of the
highly controversial aid issue. Under O'Neill's
leadership, the House has repeatedly frustrated
Reagan's desire to supply the contras with
weapons. Not since early 1984, after Congress
learned that the CIA had mined a Nicaraguan

harbor, has the House permitted military assis
tance to the rebels.
The plan for a presidential address was
devised by White House officials after the
House Republican leaders failed to negotiate a
compromise measure that would have had the
support of moderate House Democrats.
Speakes acknowledged yesterday that Reagan's
aid proposal was still a few votes short of the
number needed for passage in the House.
Speakes said White House chief of staff
Donald Regan called O'Neill yesterday after
noon to request the opportunity for the presi
dent to speak shortly before he leaves Wash
ington for a week's vacation.
