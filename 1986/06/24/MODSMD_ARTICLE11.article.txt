AIDS can justify firing
WASHINGTON — An employer can dismiss a
person suffering from AIDS merely by voicing fear
that the disease will spread in the workplace, without
violating a law prohibiting discrimination against the
handicapped, the Justice Department has concluded.
An AIDS-infected worker would have no legal
resource or avenue of redress under the Rehabilita
tion Act of 1973 unless the employer used fear of
contagion as a to discriminatorily fire, transfer
or demote the worker, the Office of Legal Counsel
said in a 49-page opinion.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits dis
crimination on the basis of handicap in any program
or activity that receives federal financial assistance.
The opinion made public yesterday said that sec
tion "simply does not reach decisions based on fear of
contagion — whether reasonable or not — so as long
as it is not in truth a pretext for discrimination on ac
count of handicap."
The opinion was written by Assistant Attorney
General Charles Cooper, who heads the Office of
Legal Counsel, a division of the Justice Department.
Jeff Levi, executive director of the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force, which has 7,000 members,
said: "The decision seems to be based on politics and
fear, not on good law or good public health.
If a person is dismissed from a job or excluded
from a federal program solely because he suffers from
the effects of AIDS, his dismissal would be illegal —
if he is otherwise qualified for the position, said the
opinion signed Friday.
But if the person was excluded because of concern
by the employer that he would spread the disease, it
said on the other hand, the dismissal generally would
represent no violation of Section 504.
Shuttle delayed by 2 years
WASHINGTON — The chief of the space shuttle
program said yesterday that the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration faces "major threats" to its
tentative schedule to return the shuttle fleet to flight
status in July 1987.
Without specifying what the threats are, NASA

Assoc. Administrator Richard Truly said it was still
too soon to project a new schedule, but Secretary of
the Air Force Edward Aldridge said it appeared now
that the Jan. 28 Challenger disaster might cause a
flight delay of two years rather than the 18 months
projected by the civilian space agency.
Truly and Aldridge made their comments at a
seminar for aerospace executives sponsored by the
United States Space Foundation, a private organiza
tion.
Truly endorsed the findings of the presidential
commission that investigated the tragedy and called
for major management changes at NASA. By
working closely with the presidential investigators
and anticipating their recommendations, the space
agency gained about three months in its timetable for
returning the flight status, he told the conference.
But, even at that, he said it might be impossible to
redesign the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rocket and test
it in time to meet the original schedule.
For now, Truly said, there is no point in trying to
set a new target date for launch because a National
Research Council panel that will oversee the redesign
is just beginning its work. He said he hoped to have a
preliminary redesign later in the summer of the
rocket joint that failed and caused the destruction of
the Challenger 73 seconds after launch.
Dead man wins election
REDWOOD CITY - A sheriff who died in April
won a June 3 election by a 4-to-l margin over his
security-guard opponent, forcing a special March
election, county officials announced yesterday.
San Mateo Sheriff Brendan Maguire received 79
percent of the vote, while challenger Jim White had
20 percent, according to results disclosed by County
Clerk Marvin Church. The ballots earlier had been
ordered sealed while the legality of the election was
decided in the courts.
The final count was 81,679 for Maguire, who died
of a heart attack April 2\, to 20,839 for White, a
guard at the U.S. Mint. ,
Maguire's supporters accused White of being un
qualified for office.
