Shultz suggests Marcos leave U.S.
SINGAPORE — Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday
blamed Ferdinand Marcos for most of the economic and political
problems that plague the Philippines and suggested that the deposed
president should end his Hawaiian exile and seek asylum in some
other country.
Shultz, who is scheduled to arrive today in Manila, the Philippine
capital, as part of a Southeast Asian tour, said Marcos' blunders while
in office and his interference in Philippine politics since his ouster
have aggravated the difficulties faced by President Corazon Aquino's
government.
He was especially critical of Marcos for manipulating the Philippine
economy to increase his own popularity while in office.
"The Marcos regime built up a number of economic enterprises
that employed people but were not economic," Shultz said. "So part
of the structural adjustment that is going on is to try to have the en
terprises that survive be economically viable enterprises.
"So if you happen to be working in one that isn't, that can con
stitute a problem and no doubt it worries some people and it ought to
worry them. But you have to get rid of enterprises like that," he said.
Shultz said the dislocation of those workers has fueled recent pro-
Marcos demonstrations against the Aquino government.
Asked if the United States wants Marcos to leave Hawaii and go to
another country, Shultz said, "Mr. Marcos has on a number of occa
sions expressed his desire to leave the United States. We don't have
any desire to have in our country persons who do not want to be there.
So under the circumstances, we'd just as soon he leave."
