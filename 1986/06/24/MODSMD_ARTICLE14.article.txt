# OPINIONS
## The
						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Editor's welcome 
### 
In high school, my greatest aspiration was to become a ballet dan
cer. All through the school year, I spent hours in dance class preparing
for auditions and examinations, did hundreds of plies, and practiced,
practiced, practiced. When summer came, and my friends went off to
sun-filled vacations in Hawaii, I went to ballet school to practice some
more.
By now I've realized that I will never dance with Mikhail Barysh
nikov, especially since I'm almost a foot taller than he is with my
pointe shoes on. And I prefer watching ballet in the City to taking
class. But I haven't lost what I learned in those years of training, for
when you're a dancer, practice never makes perfect. There's always
something you could do better. Once you've done a double pirouette,
there's always a triple to try.
Our goal this summer won't be attempting triple turns in the offices
of The Daily; instead of working at a bane, we'll be working at the
computer terminal. But we will be seeking to put out the best paper we
can. It's no secret that we won't always achieve everything we'd like,
but we sure are going to try. And just as every dancer must give his or
her best in a corps de ballet, so must each member of the staff — from
editors to photographers to advertising representatives — work as a
team to get The Daily to you.
But every dancer needs a choreographer, and we need a community
that is willing to give us ideas about how to make the paper better. We
need you to tell us what you're doing, so write us a letter for the
Opinions page, give us a call, or stop by and talk to the editorial board.
We'll be ready to listen.
Before every class, as we were warming up, my dance teacher would
tell us in a soft British accent, "Dance as if each class is a perfor
mance." And it is with that in mind that we will approach The Daily
this summer.
Let the dance begin.
