Western Culture
is a good program
Here are some ideas I have on
Western Culture, to share with
everyone to help them understand
what is involved.
The program is not a "White
Man's Roots" boosting his ego by
praising his male ancestors. Look
not only at its emphasis on the Bible
(and its homeland), on the Greeks
and Romans (that is Italians), but
also at the fact that the rest of

Europe first accepted these alien in
fluences and made them their own,
before adding to them spectacularly.
The claim that the program is
valuable does not mean that every
part of it should serve as a model of
conduct and of judgment; in fact,
much of it is a warning not to act, to
think, to talk the way the character
in the books and even their authors
do. People of my generation never
took this program when we went to
school or college; it was instituted
about 50 years ago as a cultural
"Affirmative Action" program, and

that's what it really is for: to provide
people with a background that they
do not have, for one reason or an
other, but that they need, that is
useful, and that is enjoyable.
I do not have to mention any of
the big names because you know
them, since you have taken the
course; I want to mention just one
more thing which has made the cul
tural transmission and tradition pos
sible: the BOOK.
