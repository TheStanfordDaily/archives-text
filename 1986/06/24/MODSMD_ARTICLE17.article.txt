## U.S. should not support Nicaragua's contra 'criminals' 
### 
In a typical raid on a little Nicaraguan hamlet, a
group of contras would gather the population in some
centric spot, execute men suspected of collaborating
with the Sandinista regime, burn some houses and, per
haps, kidnap some youngsters in order to force them to
join la contra. This is the amiable side of the contras.
Their harshest side is better exhibited by a testimony
according to which, in one of these raids, "they raped a
14-year-old girl. Then they slit her throat and cut
off her head. They hung the head on a pole along the
road to frighten and intimidate people." (T. Cabestrero,
"Blood of the Innocent")
If the reader finds comfort in the belief that these
cases are isolated, he or she must know that Amnesty In
ternational and the Catholic Church of Nicaragua have
gathered quite a collection of reports and testimonies in
which the systematic cruelty of the contras is left beyond
any possibility of doubt.

Adolfo de la Sienra

It is obviously ludicrous to compare the Founding
Fathers of the United States of America with a criminal
band of rapists, torturers and murderers. The claim that
the contras are freedom fighters is an insult to reason.
Their tactics are based on the systematic exercise of ter
ror and the overwhelming majority of the Nicaraguan
people think of them as what they really are; namely, a
gang of criminals on the loose that represents the dark
ness of the Somocista oppression.
Leaving aside the fact that the contras are stupid and
inept militarily, no political reasoning can justify their
crimes against humanity. It is absurd to maintain that a
band of criminals deserves the United States' support
just because it happens to oppose the Marxist regime of
Managua. The argument that they are defending the vi
tal interests of the United States, even if it were true
(which it is not), is no safeguard against the moral re
sponsibilities incurred by those who support the contras.
Those who support the contras also support their
atrocities and will be made morally accountable, for that
reason, to their own consciences (this means you). The
United States does indeed have both the right and the
duty to defend her vital interests.
If the Sandinistas are a real threat to the security of

the United States, the U.S. Congress should establish
that fact beyond any reasonable doubt and act accord
ingly. Go ahead and formally declare war on Nicaragua,
respecting the Geneva Conventions on conventional
warfare. I think that in the extreme case this would be
the least immoral course of action left for the United
States against the Sandinistas. Isn't it paradoxical that,

Isn't it paradoxical that,

ful armies in the world, the
United States has had to resort

in order to pursue its political
objectives?

having one of the most powerful armies in the world,
the United States has had to resort to inept mercenaries
who compromise this country's moral prestige in order
to pursue its political objectives?
Fortunately for everybody, there is no need for a U.S.
invasion of Nicaragua. There is still time for the United
States to stop the contra terrorism and try to gain a better
image and some political presence inside Nicaragua.
Three-quarters of the Nicaraguan economy is still in
private hands and it is likely that an ending of the contra
hostilities would make it harder for the Sandinistas to
maintain their crackdown on the opposition.
What is required is a bold, clever U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua, capable of effectively helping to create a
strong and civilized opposition to the Sandinistas inside
of the country. Of course, to achieve such an important
political goal is far more difficult and expensive than
paying mercenaries to terrorize innocent civilians and
harm the economy of that Central American nation.
