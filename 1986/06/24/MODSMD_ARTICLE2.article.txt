# Library site irks neighbors
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
University faculty and members of the community
are seeking to delay a final decision to locate the
planned Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in the
Stanford foothills by Campus Road East, charging that
car traffic flow, future "core academic needs" and the
aesthetic beauty of the foothills are threatened by the
proposed location.
Stanford's Board of Trustees last week authorized
University plans to allow the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Foundation to build the library and an access route
that calls for an extension of Campus Drive East into the
foothills from the area near Lake Lagunita.
The Stanford Foothills Residents Group, comprised
of homeowners living on or near Junipero Serra
Boulevard, said in an April letter to University officials
that "the original site selection process was sufficiently

flawed that taking another look at the whole matter
would be warranted."
The group has since proposed that the library be
moved further back into the foothills to make it "less
dominating of the campus" and to reserve the closer
area for future academic needs. The group has also sug
gested an access route branching from Alpine Road
close to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
I The approximately 70 residents last month hired Palo
I Alto environmental lawyer Michael Endicott to repre
sent the group's interests during upcoming hearings by
environmental and government agencies.
"We're going to pursue all routes available (to have
the site altered)," Endicott said yesterday.
The group is concerned not only with the currently
proposed site but with the whole planning process,
which they feel did not adequately consider their inter-
ests, Endicott said.
Education Prof. Robert Bush,
who has represented the Foothills
Residents Group during meetings
with University officials, told
Campus Report that the increased
traffic on Junipero Serra would in
crease a traffic load that is already
"almost past saturation."
Prof. David Abernethy, the
only faculty member on the Univer
sity Reagan Presidential Library
Planning Committee, cast the sole
dissenting vote in the committee's
decision to approve the Campus
Drive East route.
"I would have preferred one or
two other locations, but the trustees
have decided and now we have to
work on making (the library) as un
obtrusive as possible," Abernethy
said.
He described the proposed site as
a compromise between proponents
of a library in central campus and

those who would prefer the building
far removed from the University.
"A purpose of the library would
be to make it accessible to graduates
and undergraduates" who might not
use its resources if it were too far
removed from campus, Abernethy
said.
He added, however, that he was
unhappy about plans to make the
building two stories tall — "it makes
it far too visible" — and said he
"strongly opposes" such a plan.
During a May 28 meeting of Uni
versity officials on behalf of the
Foothills Residents Group, Bush
asked that Stanford "at least
postpone action" on the recom
mended route, and in a prepared
statement , the homeowners warned
that "undue continued pressure" by
the Reagan Presidential Foundation
is "not in the best interest of the
University."
The trustees nevertheless condi
tioned their approval of the Campus
East route "subject to further
review."
