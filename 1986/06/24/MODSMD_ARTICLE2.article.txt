# Library site irks neighbors
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
University faculty and members of the community
are seeking to delay a final decision to locate the
planned Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in the
Stanford foothills by Campus Road East, charging that
car traffic flow, future "core academic needs" and the
aesthetic beauty of the foothills are threatened by the
proposed location.
Stanford's Board of Trustees last week authorized
University plans to allow the Ronald Reagan Presiden
tial Foundation to build the library and an access route
that calls for an extension of Campus Drive East into the
foothills from the area near Lake Lagunita.
The Stanford Foothills Residents Group, comprised
of homeowners living on or near Junipero Serra
Boulevard, said in an April letter to University officials
that "the original site selection process was sufficiently

flawed that taking another look at the whole matter
would be warranted."
The group has since proposed that the library be
moved further back into the foothills to make it "less
dominating of the campus" and to reserve the closer
area for future academic needs. The group has also sug
gested an access route branching from Alpine Road
close to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
I The approximately 70 residents last month hired Palo
I Alto environmental lawyer Michael Endicott to repre
sent the group's interests during upcoming hearings by
environmental and government agencies.
"We're going to pursue all routes available (to have
the site altered)," Endicott said yesterday.
The group is concerned not only with the currently
proposed site but with the whole planning process,
which they feel did not adequately consider their inter-
