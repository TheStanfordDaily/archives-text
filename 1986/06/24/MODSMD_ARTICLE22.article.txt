When my friend and 1 first heard
the name Dinah's Shack, visions of
chicken cordon bleu or filet mignon
never really entered our minds. In
stead, we considered the prospects of
joint insurance.
We were, indeed, skeptical.
"Dinah" was fine, but "Shack" gave
us some problems.
Due to the deceptive
nomenclature, what thoughts we
might have had were quickly dashed
once we stepped inside the restau
rant — a cozy, comfortable arena of
family camaraderie and general
good cheer.
Attractive, dimly-lit chandeliers
nicely complemented the wood
cabinetry and oil portraits, which
outlined the interior. Even the
tables themselves, covered by a
traditional red cloth and lighted by
candle, promoted a warm atmos
phere.
Yes, my friend and I were both
surprised and happy until we were
told that we had a 15-minute wait
since the restaurant was full.
Though starved, we managed to
survive long enough to survey the
Dinah Shack lounge tucked away
from the dining room area. Com
plete with big screen television and
the new and nifty visual sports radio,

the lounge has a full scale bar for
those who have palates to wet.
A few Stanford pennants dot the
lounge walls to remind you that
Dinah's Shack is only a few miles
south of the Farm off of El Camino
Real.
Dinah's lounge also has live en
tertainment Tuesday through Satur
day from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. with this
week featuring guitarist John
Schlicht.
Music and margarita's aside, my
friend and I were there for one sole
purpose — to eat. So when our
names were called, we were ready
for the task at hand and mouth.
We were seated by a very friendly
hostess named Billy, who seemed to
know at least half the crowd, fre
quently being greeted by an ecstatic
hug or two.
Once stationed, we feverishly
perused the menu. As we found,
Dinah's Shack has a fairly compre
hensive selection ranging from the
aforementioned Chicken Cordon
Bleu ($8.75) and Filet Mignon
($11.75) to the Ail-American and
all-sizable Cheeseburger with Fries
($5.50).
Prime rib is also offered, given in
two sizes — one for the hearty and
one for the extra-hearty.
The mainstay for Dinah's Shack,
however, seems to fall heavily under
the term smorgasbord. In Scan
dinavia, this word translates to
bountiful amounts of a variety of
foods. For Dinah's Shack, it means
the same and then some. Dinah's
smorgasbord includes over 40 differ

ent hot and cold dishes elegantly ar
ranged on a large buffet with
decorative bottles of wine centered
on a upper tier.
The buffet offers a wide selection
of salads — potato, pasta, gelatine
and fruit. Many types of meats and
cheeses are sprinkled about along
with an assortment of Nordic
influenced fish preparations. Four
hot dishes are served and systemati
cally shuffled to ensure a constant
variety.
If you are still hungry after one in
itial onslaught, Dinah's Shack gives
you a chance to burn off some of
those calories from the first round
with a second, third or even 10th
walk to the buffet for a re-load.
Swimming is not recommended af
terwards.
The entire limitless smorgasbord
goes for a very reasonable $8.95,
and for this reviewer, it is the best
bet here.
My partner, meanwhile, stayed
sedentary, ordering the New York
Steak ($12.95) off the entree listing.
All entrees include choice of soup or
salad, homemade biscuits and
honey, a vegetable and a baked
potato.
The steak was quite good but not
exceptional. Dinah's Shack seems to
be best geared towards the simpler,
more traditional items.
Finally, and I do mean finally, we
reserved just enough room for one of
the many offered desserts. Sifting
through the likes of apple pie ala
mode and Dinah's Cheese Cake, we
arrived at the Strawberry Parfait and

the Chocolate Mousse. As
Hemingway once said, it was good
— very, very good.
No doubt, at a place such as
Dinah's Shack, one feels almost
compelled to order desert. It's a fam
ily place — Mom, Dad, the
grandparents — the whole bit. If
you feel uncomfortable by such an

environment, forever trapped in the
body of a bopper, you should try to
change, or at least, compromise
your style.
The melodious tunes of the har
pist should put you at ease as well as
the final bill, which is remarkably
fair, given the quality and quantity
of the Dinah's Shack experience.
