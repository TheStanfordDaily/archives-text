## The
						Bug returns bearing curiosity relief 
### KIRK JENSEN JOHN POWELL Staff writers 
If you are like most others at Stan
ford, summer is a time to put away
the textbooks and term papers and to
escape to more relaxing, less
structured thoughts. No longer must
you be concerned with studying
what someone else has prescribed.
Rather, you can devote more time to
pondering and to letting your mind
wander. Many perplexing, confus
ing and disturbing questions may
have cropped up during the aca
demic year, only to be deferred until
now. At last you are capable of
making a more complete attempt at
answering questions that, though in
significant during the academic
year, now appear at the forefront of
your thoughts. These questions
dominate you, restricting you from
all other pursuits, until finally they
are answered and buried respectfully
in the cemetery of the mind.
The following questions were
written during the academic year,
only to remain in The Bug's files,
unanswered. Finally, summer has
rolled along, and they have regained
their original terror. We couldn't be
satisfied until these questions were
laid to rest, and though they re
quired painful and costly attacks of
the mind, the victory is sweet. Un
fortunately, we cannot continue this
winning battle, to answer the un
answered, and to continue the pur
suit of the ultimate truth, without
your deep, probing questions. Send
us those questions today!
DEAR BUG ME: J often notice that
my classmates, when they fall asleep
in class, twitch as if they were epilep
tic. What causes these muscular ex
plosions? Junk food? Fatigue?
Drugs? Lack of (or too much) sex?
— Baffled
DEAR BAFFLED: Although
these episodes of involuntary mus
cular contractions are quite com
mon, their exact cause is not yet
known. We started our search at the

Stanford University Hospital emer
gency room, where Dr. George
Sternbach informed us that this type
of behavior is referred to as a
"myoclonic spasm." Armed with the
correct terminology, or so we
thought, we headed to the Stanford
Sleep Disorders Clinic. The admin
istrator of the clinic, Lisa Vitkus,

termed the twitching behavior
"hypnic jerk" and described it as a
"startle response" that usually occurs
as a person enters early sleep stages.
To Vitkus' knowledge, no signifi
cant studies have ever been done on
hypnic jerks (nor on any other jerks
for that matter). Apparently, re
searchers explored the entire range
of sleep-related spasms with fervor in
the late 19605, when the sleep re
search field was concerned with al
tered states of consciousness.
We next consulted Cathy De
ment, daughter of world-renowned
Stanford sleep researcher Dr.
William Dement. Cathy concurred
with both of the above sources,
naming the twitch a "myoclonic
jerk." She added that this awakening
happens more often with nervous
people and usually requires some
sort of outside stimulus.
Finally, we contacted the Stan
ford Sleep Disorders Center in an ef
fort to find a more complete answer,
or at least to discover the correct
name for this mysterious twitch.
David Cobasko, a clinical researcher
at the center, provided a beautiful
synthesis of the terminology,
pronouncing the behavior a "hypnic
myoclonia." (Or is that myoclonic
hypnosis?) Cobasko explained that
the cause of this "sudden motor out

burst" is still unknown, but he prag
matically assured us that one day re
searchers will find a biochemical ex
planation for the behavior. When
asked why no one seems to be pursu
ing research in this area, Cobasko
responded that the twitch "is not an
interesting sort of thing."
Though no full answers exist
today as to why these twitches occur,
at least you will no longer be baffled
with what to call them. (Or maybe
you'll be more baffled.)
DEAR BUG ME: I have been going
out (very serioulsy, mind you) with
this same guy all year. I love him
more than anything in the world,
but I have a big fear. Until now, we
have never spent any time apart. But
this summer he is leaving for three
months. My fear is that I will be at
tracted to someone else while he is
not here and I don't want anything
to come between us. I know he will
be loyal to me — and I promised him
the same — but I'm afraid I will
break the promise. What should I
do?
— Lonely in Love
DEAR LONELY: While you
may feel you are all alone, there
are actually many others in very
similar situations. When you get
right down to it, you must be true to

yourself. If you really meant it when
you promised him your love, then
you know how to behave while he's
gone.
On the other hand, life is too
short for these kinds of commit
ments. If we were you, we wouldn't
let a summer at Stanford go by
pining away for a distant love.
Readers, any suggestions?
DEAR BUG ME: Why do soda cans
say they contain 12 ounces or 354
milliliters of soda, while beer cans
purport to contain a similar 12
ounce yet list 355 milliliters?
— Can't get enough
DEAR CANT: We're sorry this
answer took so long, and hope that
you haven't awaited it too thirstily.
Truth maintains that 12 fluid
ounces equals 354.88236 milliliters.
So what forces have influenced
the soda and alcoholic beverage in
dustries to adopt 354 milliliters and
355 milliliters as their respective of
ficial conversions?
We first called Coca-Cola's con
sumer hotline, which connected us
with Sharon Jackson. After 10
minutes of "TTie Best of Coke's
Theme Songs," she came back on
the line to explain. Originally, Coke
had no guidelines for metric conver
sions, so they rounded up to 355

milliliters because it is closer to
354.88 milliliters. This practice was
later changed because the
"appropriate government agency
advised that the number should be
rounded down," Jackson said.
How then does one explain the
355 milliliter conversion used by
most alcoholic beverage companies?
We called Coors, who answered that
there are different regulatory
agencies governing the two different
industries, and thus the discrepancy.
We then called The Bureau of Al
cohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF)
for an explanation. While there are
no specific regulations to govern the
actual conversion from fluid ounces
to milliliters, the ATF does approve
labels for accuracy. Because of high
speed and imperfect machinery,
levels vary. A reasonable variance of
.5 percent is allowed, but if
this allowance is exceeded, the
brewer is subject to a tax on the
excess amount of beer sold. It fol
lows that the safest conversion for
the brewer is one that is closest to
the original number, regardless of
rounding direction.
We hope this answers your ques
tion, Can't, and that it may bring
you many more blissful days of beer
and soda consumption.
