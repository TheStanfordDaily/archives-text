# Koppel warns grads of television dangers

### MARY K. McDEVITT Editorial staff 
ABC's "Nightline" host Ted Koppel warned
communications graduates about a potentially
dangerous television world.
Koppel addressed the approximately 250
aspiring journalists under the hot afternoon sun
in Memorial Court, warning them against be
coming prisoners of a rapidly developing media
technology. "It is the electronic tail wagging the
editorial dog," he said. "Be cautious of that."
Koppel, following his Commencement ad
dress June 15, urged the graduates and their
family members and friends to ponder the con
sequences of today's advanced satellite and
computer technology.

New advances have "telescoped and ab
breviated" our reaction time to televised news,
Koppel said.
"We live in a period in which it is possible,
for example, for the president of South Africa to
give a speech at one o'clock in the afternoon,
for that speech to be transmitted live via satellite
to the United States, for a reaction to come
from the White House or the State Department
within a matter of an hour or two, and for the
reaction to the reaction to come within a matter
of minutes or hours from South Africa," he
said.
"Unfortunately that doesn't lend to a great
deal of consideration."
Koppel emphasized that the dangers of tech
nological abuse exist right now. "We already

have today the kind of technology that will per
mit any group — and I include terrorists among
them — to have, for example, what is called a
'suitcase ground station,' a portable with
capacity for beaming a signal from any part of
the world to a satellite and back down again into
any part of the world.
"I worry about the foreshortening of time,"
he said. "I worry that we don't yet have a full
grasp of the extraordinary technology that other
geniuses have put together."
Koppel graduated from Stanford with a
master's degree in communication in 1962.
The following year he joined "ABC News" to
become the youngest network correspondent at
that time. Now hosting "Nightline," he has
more than 5 million viewers.
