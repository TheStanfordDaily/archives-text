Marianne Werdel and Leigh
Anne Eldredge — the No. 2 and
No. 3 singles players on the Stanford
women's tennis team's national
championship roster — have been
named to the 1986 Junior Federa
tion Cup team, the United States
Tennis Association (USTA) an
nounced last week in New York.
Eldredge, who was a member of
the 1984 Junior Federation Cup
team, compiled a 22-2 dual-match
record last season and finished No.
14 in the Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association (ITCA) na
tional singles rankings.
Several of Eldredge's most im
pressive victories came at the NCAA
championships in May in Austin,
Texas. There, she recorded four
consecutive singles victories in the
team competition, including a cru
cial straight-set win over USC's
Maeve Quinlan in the Cardinal's 5-
4 victory over the Trojans in the
final match.
"Leigh Anne's consistency and
mental toughness are her primary
strengths," said Sheila Mclnerney,

coach of the Junior Federation Cup
team. "She is solid off both sides and
doesn't beat herself. "
Werdel, who is playing at
Wimbledon this week, said last
month that she would probably not
accept if she were selected to play on
the Federation Cup team. She indi
cated that she prefers having a
flexible summer schedule, which
could be restricted by some of the
commitments required bv the
USTA.
Werdel was No. 8 in the final
ITCA poll last season. Like
Eldredge, she notched four straight
singles victories at the NCAA team
competition.
"Marianne hits huge
groundstrokes," Mclnerney said.
"She hits as hard as anyone in
women's tennis."
As well as playing at Wimbledon
this summer, Werdel will play in
the U.S. Open in August and will
represent the United States at the
Goodwill Games in the Soviet Un
ion during July. She played on the
pro tour last summer, winning
USTA events in Fayetteville, N.C.
and Key Biscayne, Fla.
