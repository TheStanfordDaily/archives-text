# Sports world going crazy

The past week in the world of
sports could easily be filed under
"Tales of the Unexpected" or
"Ripley's Believe It or Not.''
First, the Philadelphia 76ers —
whose fans envisioned a monstrous
and talented frontline of Charles
Barkley, Brad Daugherty and Moses

COMMENTARY

Malone — turned dynasty into
destruction last Tuesday by trading
Malone to Washington and the top
pick in the draft (with which they
presumably would have picked
North Carolina's Daugherty) to
Cleveland.
The story doesn't end there. Two
days later, Philadelphia General
Manager Pat Williams resigned so
he could join other businessmen in
an attempt to develop a new NBA
franchise. Could it possibly have
been in Williams' best interest to
disperse the 76ers' talent around the
league so he would not have to con
tend with a powerhouse as the
owner of a new team?
