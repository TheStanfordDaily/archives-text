# Sports world going crazy

### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
The past week in the world of
sports could easily be filed under
"Tales of the Unexpected" or
"Ripley's Believe It or Not.''
First, the Philadelphia 76ers —
whose fans envisioned a monstrous
and talented frontline of Charles
Barkley, Brad Daugherty and Moses

COMMENTARY

Malone — turned dynasty into
destruction last Tuesday by trading
Malone to Washington and the top
pick in the draft (with which they
presumably would have picked
North Carolina's Daugherty) to
Cleveland.
The story doesn't end there. Two
days later, Philadelphia General
Manager Pat Williams resigned so
he could join other businessmen in
an attempt to develop a new NBA
franchise. Could it possibly have
been in Williams' best interest to
disperse the 76ers' talent around the
league so he would not have to con
tend with a powerhouse as the
owner of a new team?
The next lesson in poor decision making
came from Auburn's Bo Jackson, who shocked
most sports fans by signing a major league
contract with baseball's Kansas City Royals.
The winner of college football's Heisman
Trophy last year, Jackson was the No. 1 pick
in the NFL draft. With speed and size to
match the likes of Eric Dickerson, Jackson was
to be a terror with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
He spoke openly of playing baseball — his
"first love" — instead of football, but few
believed him. His collegiate baseball statistics
were good, but not overly impressive. The
common belief was that he was using the
baseball line as a bargaining chip, a la John
Elway.
Two days ago, however, Black Sunday hit
Tampa Bay as Jackson announced his inten

tions. It's a good bet that within two years Jack
son will have bought his way out of the Kansas
City contract and will be in the NFL where he
belongs. Remember Danny Ainge?
Just when the sporting world was ready for
an ordinary occurrence, the unthinkable hap
pened. The Giants took over first place in the
National League Western Division with a
doubleheader sweep of the Houston Astros on
Sunday.
Pennant Fever in San Francisco conjures
up thoughts of Mays, McCovey and Marichal.
But this year's version of the Bay Area
Bombers would certainly stump the panel on
"What's My Line?" Aldrete, Kutcher, Melvin,
Mulholland, Quinones, Uribe, Woodard —
Who are these guys?
Maybe the Giants will fade, but if yester
day's result is any indication, that won't be the
case. San Francisco pummeled San Diego 18-
1 at Candlestick Park to move two games up
on the Astros.
