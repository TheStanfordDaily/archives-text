# Johnson resumes suit against DoD
## 
### KRISHNA WEST Editorial staff 
Stanford computer scientist Clif
ford Johnson has renewed a two-year
legal battle against the alleged
"unconstitutionality" of current
U.S. nuclear defense policy.
Johnson, a manager of capacity
planning in the Office of Informa
tion Technology Services, refiled a
lawsuit in federal court June 17,
claiming he can prove that the
Defense Department has uncon
stitutionally relegated control of nu
clear missile launches to computers.
The suit accuses Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger of operating
a launch-on-warning capability
(LOWC) missile defense system that
relies on computers to retaliate
against a missile attack. This system
is "error-prone" and violates the
constitutional power bestowed solely
on Congress and the president to
declare war, Johnson said in his suit.
Johnson was unavailable for com
ment.
Johnson first filed the suit in
February 1984, but it was dismissed
later that year on the grounds that
the military's response to the threat
of nuclear war is political and
therefore outside the court's jurisdic
tion.
Johnson appealed, and last July
the federal appeals court in San
Francisco rejected his appeal be
cause Johnson had "not alleged that
LOWC is even technically feasible,
much less that its use has been
adopted as official policy or imple
mented," according to the judges in
the case.
The government must respond to
Johnson's latest suit within 30 days.
The U.S. Attorney General's office
in San Francisco has not yet ap
pointed defense counsel in the case,

according to a spokeswoman at the
office.
Responding to his earlier court
loss, Johnson has expanded the suit
to claim that LOWC is not only
technically feasible but also part of
current U.S. defense policy.
LOWC "exists here and now, and
I'm prepared to prove it," Johnson
said at a June 17 press conference
announcing refiling of the suit. The
Defense Department has admitted
having a LOWC, but it denies
having a policy on the matter.
To back his renewed allegations,
Johnson has enlisted the support of
Arthur Miller, professor emeritus of
constitutional law at George Wash
ington University, and Robert
Aldridge, an aerospace engineer and
former Lockheed Space and Missile
Co. missile designer. Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibil
ity (CPSR), a Palo Alto-based or
ganization of 1,100 computer scien
tists, has also endorsed the suit.
Included in Johnson's
documentation for the suit is a
memorandum from Miller affirming
Johnson's right to challenge the con
stitutionality of LOWC because the
threat of an accidental launch poses
a threat to Johnson's "life, liberty or
property." Miller concludes that
LOWC, if it does exit, is uncon
stitutional because Congress cannot
delegate its power to declare war and
the president cannot delegate his
power over the use of nuclear weap
ons.
The documentation also includes
a declaration by Aldridge that "there
are indications that a launch-on
warning policy does indeed exist."
Currently, three launch-on
warning options exist in an official
description of the Pentagon's Single
