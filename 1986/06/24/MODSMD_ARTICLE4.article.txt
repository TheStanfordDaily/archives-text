# Koppel, Kennedy caution grads against false values

Commencement here character
istically balances an odd but old
mixture: mindless hedonism and
philosophical dignity.
Stanford's 95th Commencement
exercises last week, while not aban
doning the joyful spirit, seemed to
mildly upset that tradition and
marked a tilt toward thoughtfulness
and commitment.
As always, the graduates whooped
up the celebration with bubbling
champagne — hugging and kissing,
climbing on their folding chairs and
dancing and singing on the stage in
the center of Stanford Stadium.
But the graduates seemed a little
more controlled, tamer perhaps,
than in past years.
Sharing the graduates' uplifting
spirit, the Commencement speakers,
featuring ABC's "Nightline"
newsman Ted Koppel and Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy,
lightly set a tone of thoughtfulness.
Koppel, a Stanford alumnus who
garnered a standing ovation before
he even began speaking, and again
afterward, was welcomed to the
microphone with chants of "TED,
TED, TED" and "This is
Nightline." He charmed the audi

ence with a mix of one-liners, poetry
and weighty anecdotes.
"President Kennedy, we could of
I course wait another five minutes or
so; but personally I don't think either
Gorbachev or Cosby is going to
show up," Koppel said.
Koppel accepted the invitation to
deliver the Commencement address
after two earlier and highly
publicized invitations were turned
down by Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev and comedian Bill Cosby.
Moving from ancedote to
anecdote with masterful television
skill, Koppel was interrupted often
by applause and cheers from the
graduates.
"I warn you against the false
values represented by all the glitter
ing achievements so celebrated by
our media'' he told the 3,300 soon
to-be graduates, "precisely because
of who and what you are."
"You are the best, the most able
and accomplished among your
peers, and the most likely to succeed
and become the envy of your gener
ation.
"And then, for all that, you will
discover that Thoreau was right:
'Most men (and women he might
have added) do lead lives of quiet
desperation.' "
When asked after the ceremony

how he guards against living "in
quiet desperation," Koppel noted a
three-word address by Winston
Churchill: "Never give up."
"You have to keep on going, to
keep trying," Koppel said. "It's the
effort that's important."
Throughout his address Koppel
called for a reassessment of personal
values.
"We are imposing on our minds
the same burdens that we have in
flicted on our stomachs —
precooked ideas — designed to ap
peal to the largest number of people
at the lowest possible price:
McThought," he said.
"Scrutinize our speeches and
slogans, our trends and fashions, our
use and misuse of law and political
power.
"In order to transcend the best,
study the humble; find those whom
television ignores and ignore the
easy celebrityhood that television
bestows."
Koppel, who received his master's
in mass communication in 1962,
said this was his first Commence
ment at the Farm; he missed his
own graduation because of work on
the East Coast.
Kennedy, in his traditional ad
dress to the graduates, reassured

them that there is indeed life after
Stanford.
He echoed Koppel's plea: "At a
time when superficiality is almost
endemic to life, we need commit
ments that run deep," Kennedy
said.

"Are we placing too much weight
on the glamorous and the distinc
tive, and failing to recognize deeper,
more sustained — though perhaps
more ordinary — forms of service? If
so, we are surely inflicting thought
less damage," he said.
"In the end, even the most gifted
and special people are judged by
how well they perform on the things
everyone must do."
Kennedy urged the graduates to
"set your standards higher than you
can comfortably reach."
"What you know matters a whole
lost less than what you can learn,"
he said, adding that "failure is not so
bad, but low aspiration and easy
satisfaction surely are."
The subtly different approach to
Commencement began, perhaps,
several months ago when Patrick
Shannon, one of the four Senior
Class Presidents, raised the idea of
discouraging the drinking of alcohol
— usually beer and champagne —
during the ceremony.
There were, of course, quite a few
bottles popped during the cere
mony. Old-timers, however, said
that the field was drier this year than
in the past. And throughout, the
graduates bore attitudes of respect

and gratitude, mindful perhaps of
the approximately 25,000 family
members and friends who sat in the
stands behind them. At one point,
they stood on their chairs to wave at,
thank and applaud their audience.
Capping a year of student political
protest, graduate activists distributed
red sashes printed with "Fight rac
ism" and 1,000 black balloons, pro
testing the' University trustees'
refusal to totally divest from
companies doing business in South
Africa. In a silent statement similar
to that of last year's commence
ment, graduates released the bal
loons at the start of Kennedy's ad
dress.
