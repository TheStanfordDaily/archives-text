# Board hears new C-IR suggestion
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Of late, South Africa has had an
impact on the University, with stu
dents taking their protests to Com
mencement, calling for the Univer
sity to divest itself of all shares in
companies doing business in the
apartheid-ruled country.
But attempts to deal with the
problem have taken forms other
than protests. At its most recent
meeting, the University Board of
Trustees heard two different
proposals and University President
Donald Kennedy, acting as a private
individual, signed a letter on June
18 admonishing the government of
South Africa for its decision to
renew a state of emergency.
Recently, the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR) rec
ommended that the University urge

U.S. corporate leaders to threaten
disinvestment from South Africa
should apartheid continue.
The C-IR's suggestions were pre
sented in a report submitted to the
trustees during their June 13
meeting. The C-IR consists of stu
dent, faculty, staff and alumni
members.
The C-IR report favors corporate
disinvestment over other proposed
solutions to apartheid. "Dis
investment, or at least the threat of
withdrawal by U.S. corporations
doing business in South Africa is the
most effective non-violent means of
bringing about an end to the socially
injurious apartheid regime," the
report said.
The trustees are taking the pro
posal under study and will not
decide whether to adopt the policy
until they meet in September, ac
cording to C-IR head Richard

Brody, a political science professor.
James Gaither, chair of the Aca
demic Affairs and Development
Committee for the board, could not
be reached for comment.
If the policy is adopted, commu
nication to U.S. corporations of the
University's wishes will take a variety
of forms, including personal contact
between trustees, administrators and

corporate executives, Brody said. As
a shareholder in many businesses,
the University also has a right to
make suggestions, he added.
The entire question of whether or
not to adopt the C-IR's proposed
policy would become moot should
proposals in Congress calling for
U.S. companies to disinvest be
passed.

If a law is passed, then "that is the
end nf the issue,'' Brody said.
Because the situation in South
Africa is complex, a decision to
adopt the proposed policy is a
"judgment call," Brody said.
"It is not something that is totally
unambiguous," he said, adding that
