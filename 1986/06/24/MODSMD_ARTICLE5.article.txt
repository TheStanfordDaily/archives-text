# Board hears new C-IR suggestion
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Of late, South Africa has had an
impact on the University, with stu
dents taking their protests to Com
mencement, calling for the Univer
sity to divest itself of all shares in
companies doing business in the
apartheid-ruled country.
But attempts to deal with the
problem have taken forms other
than protests. At its most recent
meeting, the University Board of
Trustees heard two different
proposals and University President
Donald Kennedy, acting as a private
individual, signed a letter on June
18 admonishing the government of
South Africa for its decision to
renew a state of emergency.
Recently, the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR) rec
ommended that the University urge

U.S. corporate leaders to threaten
disinvestment from South Africa
should apartheid continue.
The C-IR's suggestions were pre
sented in a report submitted to the
trustees during their June 13
meeting. The C-IR consists of stu
dent, faculty, staff and alumni
members.
The C-IR report favors corporate
disinvestment over other proposed
solutions to apartheid. "Dis
investment, or at least the threat of
withdrawal by U.S. corporations
doing business in South Africa is the
most effective non-violent means of
bringing about an end to the socially
injurious apartheid regime," the
report said.
The trustees are taking the pro
posal under study and will not
decide whether to adopt the policy
until they meet in September, ac
cording to C-IR head Richard

Brody, a political science professor.
James Gaither, chair of the Aca
demic Affairs and Development
Committee for the board, could not
be reached for comment.
If the policy is adopted, commu
nication to U.S. corporations of the
University's wishes will take a variety
of forms, including personal contact
between trustees, administrators and

corporate executives, Brody said. As
a shareholder in many businesses,
the University also has a right to
make suggestions, he added.
The entire question of whether or
not to adopt the C-IR's proposed
policy would become moot should
proposals in Congress calling for
U.S. companies to disinvest be
passed.

If a law is passed, then "that is the
end nf the issue,'' Brody said.
Because the situation in South
Africa is complex, a decision to
adopt the proposed policy is a
"judgment call," Brody said.
"It is not something that is totally
unambiguous," he said, adding that

mony.
no one policy is perfect in this situation.
Divestment petition
At the same board meeting in which the C-IR paper
was presented, two faculty representatives presented a
petition signed by 206 faculty members calling for the
University to divest itself of all stocks in companies that
do business in South Africa.
The petition, circulated to 2,000 faculty members,
urged the trustees to make no further purchase of stock
in companies with substantial operations in South
Africa and to begin immediately "a complete and or
derly divestment, phased over a reasonable but limited
time."
The petition sharply criticized the University's policy
of considering each firm individually and divesting
selectively on that basis.
"Partial divestment is a poor policy. What is at issue
in South Africa is citizenship, political rights, freedom
and equality," the petition reads.
The board said it will consider the petition this fall
and will "continue to review seriously" its policy con
cerning South Africa.
The C-IR will be in consultation with History Prof.
George Fredrickson between now and the next board

meeting, according to Anthropology Prof. St. Claire
Drake.
Drake said that the most he personally expected to
come from the petition was a speeding up of partial di
vestment.
The board released a statement on related actions,
saying "the trustees' Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility (SCIR) focused today on accelerating its
review of portfolio corporations doing business in South
Africa."
Kennedy letter
Acting apart from the University, Kennedy, along
with 15 other prominent citizens, signed as a private in
dividual a public statement urging the South African gov
ernment "to change its course before the nation is en
gulfed in violence and irreconcilable hatreds."
The group criticized the government of South Africa
for its recent actions.
"We deplore the renewal of the state of emergency,
the mass arbitrary arrests, and the detention of over
1,000 South Africans, many of whom are known
and respected in the United States," the statement
reads.
"We also deplore the fostering of violence by the gov
ernment . . . and the neglect of the homeless casualties.
Moreover, the assault upon academic freedom signified
by violent police intrusions into university life gives
grave concern," the statement reads.

The C-IR will be in consultation with History Prof.
George Fredrickson between now and the next board

meeting, according to Anthropology Prof. St. Claire
Drake.
Drake said that the most he personally expected to
come from the petition was a speeding up of partial di
vestment.
The board released a statement on related actions,
saying "the trustees' Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility (SCIR) focused today on accelerating its
review of portfolio corporations doing business in South
Africa."
Kennedy letter
Acting apart from the University, Kennedy, along
with 15 other prominent citizens, signed as a private in
dividual a public statement urging the South African gov
ernment "to change its course before the nation is en
gulfed in violence and irreconcilable hatreds."
The group criticized the government of South Africa
for its recent actions.
"We deplore the renewal of the state of emergency,
the mass arbitrary arrests, and the detention of over
1,000 South Africans, many of whom are known
and respected in the United States," the statement
reads.
"We also deplore the fostering of violence by the gov
ernment . . . and the neglect of the homeless casualties.
Moreover, the assault upon academic freedom signified
by violent police intrusions into university life gives
grave concern," the statement reads.
Of late, South Africa has had an
impact on the University, with stu
dents taking their protests to Com
mencement, calling for the Univer
sity to divest itself of all shares in
companies doing business in the
apartheid-ruled country.
But attempts to deal with the
problem have taken forms other
than protests. At its most recent
meeting, the University Board of
Trustees heard two different
proposals and University President
Donald Kennedy, acting as a private
individual, signed a letter on June
18 admonishing the government of
South Africa for its decision to
renew a state of emergency.
Recently, the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR) rec
ommended that the University urge

U.S. corporate leaders to threaten
disinvestment from South Africa
should apartheid continue.
The C-IR's suggestions were pre
sented in a report submitted to the
trustees during their June 13
meeting. The C-IR consists of stu
dent, faculty, staff and alumni
members.
The C-IR report favors corporate
disinvestment over other proposed
solutions to apartheid. "Dis
investment, or at least the threat of
withdrawal by U.S. corporations
doing business in South Africa is the
most effective non-violent means of
bringing about an end to the socially
injurious apartheid regime," the
report said.
The trustees are taking the pro
posal under study and will not
decide whether to adopt the policy
until they meet in September, ac
cording to C-IR head Richard

Brody, a political science professor.
James Gaither, chair of the Aca
demic Affairs and Development
Committee for the board, could not
be reached for comment.
If the policy is adopted, commu
nication to U.S. corporations of the
University's wishes will take a variety
of forms, including personal contact
between trustees, administrators and

corporate executives, Brody said. As
a shareholder in many businesses,
the University also has a right to
make suggestions, he added.
The entire question of whether or
not to adopt the C-IR's proposed
policy would become moot should
proposals in Congress calling for
U.S. companies to disinvest be
passed.

If a law is passed, then "that is the
end nf the issue,'' Brody said.
Because the situation in South
Africa is complex, a decision to
adopt the proposed policy is a
"judgment call," Brody said.
"It is not something that is totally
unambiguous," he said, adding that

no one policy is perfect in this situation.
Divestment petition
At the same board meeting in which the C-IR paper
was presented, two faculty representatives presented a
petition signed by 206 faculty members calling for the
University to divest itself of all stocks in companies that
do business in South Africa.
The petition, circulated to 2,000 faculty members,
urged the trustees to make no further purchase of stock
in companies with substantial operations in South
Africa and to begin immediately "a complete and or
derly divestment, phased over a reasonable but limited
time."
The petition sharply criticized the University's policy
of considering each firm individually and divesting
selectively on that basis.
"Partial divestment is a poor policy. What is at issue
in South Africa is citizenship, political rights, freedom
and equality," the petition reads.
The board said it will consider the petition this fall
and will "continue to review seriously" its policy con
cerning South Africa.
The C-IR will be in consultation with History Prof.
George Fredrickson between now and the next board

meeting, according to Anthropology Prof. St. Claire
Drake.

come from the petition was a speeding up of partial di
