# Prof. warns Challenger explosion will affect research

### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Interruption of NASA's space shuttle pro
gram following the January explosion of the
shuttle Challenger will have severe repercus
sions on space research at Stanford, according
to Applied Physics Prof. Arthur Walker, a
member of the Rogers Commission, which in
vestigated the disaster.
Hardest hit by program delays will be the
Electrical Engineering Department and the
Applied Physics Department, he said.
Potential problems also exist for graduate
students whose research depends upon results
from shuttle experiments, Walker said.
Walker's own research will be affected by
shuttle delays. Interruption of shuttle launches

will hamper plans for a space station that was
to have included an advanced solar obser
vatory designed by Walker.
The tremendous financial burden of
rebuilding the shuttle program may cause
federal funding for research to dry up at the
University, Walker said.
He explained that the cost of redesigning
the shuttle may run up to $1 billion and a re
placement for the Challenger will cost $3 bil
lion.
"Currently, Stanford is one of the leading
universities in regard to research funded by
NASA," he said, estimating that NASA has
awarded research contracts worth $20 million
to the University.
Walker predicts that the shuttle will not
resume operation for at least a year and when

it does, military payloads will have priority.
A significant portion of the canceled
shuttle flights included "Star Wars" experi
ments, spy satellites and military communica
tions satellites. Until NASA eliminates this
backlog, it will subordinate the demands of
science and industry, Walker said.
Walker expressed optimism about the long
range impact of the Rogers Commission on
the space program's future. "The decision to
create the commission was in the long run
good for NASA," he said.
The commission supported the ideals of the
space program, but could analyze the situation
objectively, Walker said. He added that this
independence allowed the commission to
"find out what happened and to discover what
changes were necessary."

The commission has rectified the shuttle's
structural defects and NASA's organizational
weaknesses, he said. "For years the separate
space centers have operated independently.
Now they will report to a single shuttle
manager," Walker said.
Walker praised the individual talents of his
peers on the commission, including Sally
Ride, a former Ph.D. candidate of Walker's
who became the first American woman in
space.
Differing from procedures followed by most
presidential commissions, the members of the
Rogers Commission carried out the investiga
tion themselves. Walker estimated that he
made 17 trips to Washington, D.C. during his
service with the commission.
Walker partially credited the suc
cess of the investigation to its public
orientation. During the entire
process, the commission published
information almost as soon as it was
received. For example, when Mor
ton Thiokol engineers testified that
their advice had not been heeded,
the commission immediately
released this information to the
press. Texas-based Morton Thiokol
had played a central role in the
design of the Challenger's fuel
boosters.
The commission's findings show

that the unprofessional attitude of
NASA engineers was a significant
factor in the explosion, Walker said.
"The engineers of NASA were in
charge of a complex piece of equip
ment which they did not understand
in fundamental ways," he said.
Labeling the shuttle as an acci
dent waiting to happen, Walker said
that "NASA was fortunate to have
24 successful launches."
Walker also criticized NASA for
not heeding important field results.
NASA ignored indications of
damage to the O-rings, which
proved faulty in cold weather and
caused the explosion.
NASA also erred when it placed
all the space launch requirements

onto a single vehicle, Walker said.
The shuttle program did not have
sufficient funds to take care of mili
tary, scientific and commercial
payloads. During the first 24 flights,
there were not enough spare parts
and NASA frequently cannibalized
equipment from one shuttle to an
other, he added.
On the international scene,
Walker said "the explosion will
cause our space community to lose
its leadership in certain areas." He
used the long-anticipated space tele
scope to exemplify the setbacks to
the United States' space program.
Originally intended for launching
this year, the telescope will not be
sent into orbit for at least two more
years.
