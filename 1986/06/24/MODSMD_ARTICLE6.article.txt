# Prof. warns Challenger explosion will affect research

Interruption of NASA's space shuttle pro
gram following the January explosion of the
shuttle Challenger will have severe repercus
sions on space research at Stanford, according
to Applied Physics Prof. Arthur Walker, a
member of the Rogers Commission, which in
vestigated the disaster.
Hardest hit by program delays will be the
Electrical Engineering Department and the
Applied Physics Department, he said.
Potential problems also exist for graduate
students whose research depends upon results
from shuttle experiments, Walker said.
Walker's own research will be affected by
shuttle delays. Interruption of shuttle launches

will hamper plans for a space station that was
to have included an advanced solar obser
vatory designed by Walker.
The tremendous financial burden of
rebuilding the shuttle program may cause
federal funding for research to dry up at the
University, Walker said.
He explained that the cost of redesigning
the shuttle may run up to $1 billion and a re
placement for the Challenger will cost $3 bil
lion.
"Currently, Stanford is one of the leading
universities in regard to research funded by
NASA," he said, estimating that NASA has
awarded research contracts worth $20 million
to the University.
Walker predicts that the shuttle will not
resume operation for at least a year and when

it does, military payloads will have priority.
A significant portion of the canceled
shuttle flights included "Star Wars" experi
ments, spy satellites and military communica
tions satellites. Until NASA eliminates this
backlog, it will subordinate the demands of
science and industry, Walker said.
Walker expressed optimism about the long
range impact of the Rogers Commission on
the space program's future. "The decision to
create the commission was in the long run
good for NASA," he said.
The commission supported the ideals of the
space program, but could analyze the situation
objectively, Walker said. He added that this
independence allowed the commission to
"find out what happened and to discover what
changes were necessary."

The commission has rectified the shuttle's
structural defects and NASA's organizational
weaknesses, he said. "For years the separate
space centers have operated independently.
Now they will report to a single shuttle
manager," Walker said.
Walker praised the individual talents of his
peers on the commission, including Sally
Ride, a former Ph.D. candidate of Walker's
who became the first American woman in
space.
Differing from procedures followed by most
presidential commissions, the members of the
Rogers Commission carried out the investiga
tion themselves. Walker estimated that he
made 17 trips to Washington, D.C. during his
