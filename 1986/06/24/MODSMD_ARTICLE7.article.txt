# Officials annoyed over genetic center approval

### SCOTT ROTH Staff writer 
The Santa Clara Planning Commission's
May 29 approval of a proposed $50 million
medical research building at Stanford has
sparked tension between University planners
and local officials.
Palo Alto city officials have expressed con
cern about the 178,000 square foot Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine to be con
structed on the north side of Campus Drive
between Governor's Avenue and Fairchild be
cause of its close proximity to the Palo Alto
city line.
"We were primarily concered with the traf
fic, employment and housing problems that
the facility would cause," said Lynnie Melena
of the Palo Alto City Planning Commission.
"Although Stanford is not under our jurisdic
tion, we have an agreement with the Univer
sity that we can review their plans and make
recommendations to the county, which does
have the jurisdiction," Melena explained.
Melena said Palo Alto, which pursues a "no
growth" policy, was concerned about the
number of people the new center would bring
into the area. "Since we technically have no
say, Stanford ignored our concerns and went
directly to the county," she said.

But the University "will have to make im
provements in traffic flow at six intersections
should the level of service get too bad,"
Melena said.
Corb Smith, University project manager for
the new center, said resolution of any poten
tial traffic problems would not be difficult.
Stanford and the City of Palo Alto have
worked out "a very reasoned, reasonable,
amiable agreement . . . (and) Stanford has
agreed to make (traffic) mitigations" wherever
necessary, Smith said.
The proposed research center may also put
an unacceptable strain on Palo Alto's waste
disposal system, according to Palo Alto City
Councilwoman Ellen Fletcher.
Speaking as a "concerned citizen" rather
than as a representative of the City Council,
Fletcher said that "in Palo Alto we would have
required a detailed study of the center's impact
on solid waste disposal sites and on sewage dis
posal. Palo Alto is facing a crisis in its ability to
dispose of its refuse. This building will
definitely have a great impact on this system,"
she said.
Although Smith admitted that Palo Alto's
solid waste landfill is "filling up faster than ex
pected," he denied that waste from the new re
search facility will worsen the problem.

"The Center for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine is not going to make an iota of differ
ence in how fast the landfill fills up," he said.
Smith called Fletcher's concern about
sewage disposal from the center "a non-issue."
Sewage "has not been raised as a problem by
the City of Palo Alto," he said.
Fletcher said the University should be more
responsible with this project because the pro
posed site "lies only a few feet from Palo Alto
land."
"This building is barely on the other side of
the line. Those few feet in Palo Alto would
have caused the filing of an Environmental
Impact Report, public hearings and a whole
lot of new bulding codes. All Stanford had to
do was file an Environmental Assessment
Report (EAR)," Fletcher said.
"An EAR is the minimal requirement, and
we only got to see a copy of it two days before
the whole issue went before the county," she
said.
University Vice President of Business and
Finance William Massy said in no way was
Stanford trying to rush things past Palo Alto.
"This type of criticism is not unusual," Massy
said.
"There are those who would never want to
see another building constructed here. This
particular building was approved two to three

years ago. We went about it in the same man
ner as all of our other buildings. No attempt
was made to try to put anything past anyone."
A building permit for the research center
was originally granted in 1984 by the county
planning commission as part of a package deal
with the new Medical Center Office Building,
but subsequent design changes in the center
forced the University to seek a new permit this
spring.
Both Melena and Fletcher conceded that
Palo Alto has lost for the time being, but they
hope to recoup their losses in August when the
Santa Clara County Planning Commission
holds hearings to review Stanford's permit to
operate on county land.
"We are going to try to make the county
force Stanford to do some things differently
than they have done them in the past,"
Melena said.
The new research center will consolidate
work currently being conducted at four differ
ent labs on campus. Its primary goal will be to
study the function and structure of molecules
and genes as they pertain to disease. Scientists
working at the center will attempt to repair and
replace flawed genes, and hopefully to elimi
nate genetic defects like cystic fibrosis, hemo
philia and Tay-Sachs.
