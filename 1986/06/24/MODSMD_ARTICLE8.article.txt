# Lease will leave Keystone rock-less...maybe
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
The saga of the Keystone Palo Alto lease
continues, but few students will be affected by
its resolution.
Bobby Corona, owner of the nightclub, had
sold the lease on the building to a group of in
vestors who planned to convert the space into
a recorded-music dance club, according to
the San Jose Mercury News. The doors of the
club were to close July 6 and Corona allegedly
had been thinking of reopening the club in
San Jose.
But now it appears that the Keystone will
remain open at least until July 20 and may
never close. According to Mark Lando, the
night manager of the Keystone, negotiations
over the lease continue and will go on past the
reported July 6 closing date.
Leaseholder Bob Corona, the owner's
father, was even more emphatic: "When's the
ballgame over? Yeah, not until the final out.
We're not out of here yet."
Originally, the reason for the Keystone's
putative move was to obtain a larger venue.
"It's a matter of economics," said Lando,
who is also the talent buyer for the Keystone
and the Stone in San Francisco. "We feel that
we've outgrown the space." Owner Corona
was out of town and could not be reached.
With the opening of Bill Graham's
Shoreline Amphitheater later this month, the

concert geography of the South Bay will
change drastically. Lando said he believes
firmly that the Shoreline would not have taken
Keystone customers away.
"We're not in competition with the
Shoreline; we can both operate in the south
peninsula area and make it,"he said.
Though there reportedly have been com
plaints from neighbors, the Keystone has been
quick to remedy any problems, according to
Lando. As a result, relations between Palo
Alto and the Keystone have been good.
"There is no general problem with the
city," said Lando. "They're not trying to
gracefully bow us out or push us out."
Lando seemed disappointed that the
Keystone has not attracted more Stanford pa
trons. He recounted efforts to recruit more
Stanford business, such as Stanford beer
nights, but said that ultimately they were dis
continued.
In fact, the people who would be hurt most
by the Keystone's closing are Stanford bands.
"It was exposure and it was fun to play at the
Keystone," said recent graduate Marsh
McCall. He recalled the night of the 1984 Big
Game when his group, Color Force, opened
for Bonnie Hayes and the Wild Combo. They
were well received, though they could have
made more money by playing on-campus gigs,
McCall said.

This sign may change soon, and then again, it may not. The Keystone nightclub on California
Avenue is the battleground of negotiations concerning its lease and a possible move.
"I don't blame the guy (for wanting to move
the club)," McCall said. "There's this club
that's a five-minute bike ride away from
campus and most people didn't know about it.
I got the impression that most people who
went there weren't from Palo Alto."
A few clubs remain in the area, such as the
Circle Star Theater, but none has the range in
styles that the Keystone has offered. "We had
everything from the Dead Kennedys to George
Strait to comedy," said Lando.
Senior Steve Cohen, who attended six
shows last year, didn't think the closure would
affect his concert-going. "I don't think the
closing will be a big thing (because) if you can
make it to the Keystone, you can make it to
the Stone (in San Francisco)."
All the same, the Keystone "did make Palo
Alto more of a scene; now it isn't one at all,"

Cohen said. "I didn't like the hall so much;
maybe the place in San Jose will be better."
In fact, a few people were ecstatic about the
Keystone's rumored move. "It has the most
rotten acoustics of any place I've ever been,"
said third-year business graduate student
Charles Cuny, a monthly attendee of
Keystone events. "I'm glad that they're moving
to any place new."
Cuny added that he probably would not be
as inclined to go to unfamiliar acts because of
the extra distance involved.
"It (the closure) makes Palo Alto a worse
place," said Mike Hale, a Stanford employee
and longtime Palo Alto resident. Hale said he
attends about four shows a year and con
cluded, "I'll just have to go the City more of
ten."
If July 20 is indeed the final date of the
Keystone at the current location, Lando has
been busy lining up a special show. "I've been
talking to some big local names, he said,
refusing to divulge any names.
