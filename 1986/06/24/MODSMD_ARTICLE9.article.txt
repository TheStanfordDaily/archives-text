## 4 blacks in South African treason trial freed 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Four black trade un
ion officials who were the last defendants in one of South
Africa's largest political show trials were acquitted of treason
yesterday after the judge threw out a key part of the state's case.
Meanwhile, the government ordered the expulsion of
Newsweek correspondent Richard Manning, the second
foreign journalist to be marked for deportation since the
nationwide state of emergency was imposed 12 days ago. The
order came amid indications that Pretoria would maintain the
emergency even after tough new security legislation becomes
law later this week.
The trial in Pietermaritzburg, which began 13 months ago,
was one of two in which the government had sought to hamstr
ing the United Democratic Front, the militant anti-apartheid
coalition here, by charging more than three dozen of its leaders
and their trade union allies with treason.
It ended abruptly when the prosecution conceded its case
had collapsed. The move followed a landmark ruling two
weeks ago that most of the state's audio and video tapes of al
legedly treasonable activities by the defendants were not admis
sible.
Presiding Justice John Milne said the state had failed to es
tablish that the tapes, some of which had suspicious gaps, had
not been tampered with, and that they accurately represented
what the prosecution claimed they were — records of political
meetings both within and outside South Africa at which the
defendants spoke or appeared. The judge said the state also
failed to establish that the voices heard on the tapes actually
were those of the defendants.
After the ruling, the prosecution asked for an adjournment.
When court reconvened yesterday morning, Michael Imber,
attorney general for Natal Province, told the judge that the
state had decided to stop the prosecution.

Milne then acquitted the four defendants, all of whom are
top officials of the South Africa Allied Workers' Union. Con
sidered one of the country's toughest new trade unions, the
South Africa Allied Workers' Union is a general workers' un
ion and is especially strong in the troubled East London area,
where blacks are militant and politically well-organized.
The four officials first were arrested almost two years ago and
held nearly eight months before being released on bail that in
cluded stringent restrictions that banned them from any politi
cal activities.
The four were carried on the shoulders of supporters outside
the courthouse where they were able to speak freely for the first
time since their arrest.
"I feel like I've been in a political deep freeze for two years,"
said Richard Gqweta, the union's national president. He said
he and the others remain committed to "continue the work."
Twelve co-defendants who are top officials of the United
Democratic Front (UDF) were freed last December when an
other portion of the state's case collapsed. Another 22 UDF
leaders, who were first arrested nearly two years ago, are still on
trial in a similar treason case in a town east of Johannesburg.
They remain in prison during the trial, which began in Janu
ary.
The ordered deportation of Newsweek's Manning followed
the magazine's pointed cover story last week on South Africa,
in which President Pieter Botha was accused of turning "a
racist regime into a police state" and of giving police "a license
to kill."
Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha, in issuing the order,
said only that he considered it"in the public interest to order
your removal from the Republic of South Africa." Manning
said Newsweek would appeal the action, which requires him to
leave South Africa by midnight Thursday.

Time magazine had three blank pages in the June 23 edition
received yesterday by South African subscribers. A notice said
the emergency rules barred publication of the article carried in
editions elsewhere, adding, "Time apologizes to its readers for
this omission, which is beyond its control.
While Time is printed locally, the Newsweek edition dis
tributed in South Africa is printed in Europe.
The government yesterday appeared to be weighing whether
to retain the state of emergency after Botha signs new legisla
tion allowing police to detain political activists for up to six
months without charge and to declare and limit access to desig
nated "unrest areas."
Some opposition politicians and political analysts had
predicted that Botha would lift the emergency once the new
measures were law. But Deputy Information Minister Louis
Nel told the Johannesburg Star that the government still had
not considered ending the emergency.
The Star said other sources indicated it would only be lifted
when officials were certain they would not have to reimpose it.
An estimated 3,000 persons have been detained under the
measure.
The pro-government newspaper The Citizen quoted sources
as saying the emergency had been "so successful" in stabilizing
the unrest situation in South Africa that officials planned to
maintain it while keeping the new measures "held in reserve."
The government has reported that 57 people have died in
unrest since the emergency was imposed. Last week's death toll
was one of the highest in recent months, although officials
have maintained that the total number of incidents is drop
ping.
Police served summonses to two religious leaders accused of
sheltering black refugees from the violence-wracked Crossroads
squatter camp outside Cape Town.
