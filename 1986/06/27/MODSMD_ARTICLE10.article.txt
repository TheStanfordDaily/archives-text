# UPDATE
## Pretoria frees 20 labor leaders 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa — In an effort to end a
paralyzing wave of strikes, the
South African government yester
day began releasing black labor
leaders detained without charge
under the two-week-old state of
emergency.
About 20 union officials were
freed following angry protests from
businessmen who warned the gov
ernment that the country would
soon face widespread labor unrest
if the unionists remained in deten
tion.
Among those freed was Piros
haw Camay, general secretary of
the all-black Council of Unions of
South Africa, which represents
about 180,000 workers. He esti
mated that at least 1 50 and per
haps 200 others were still being
held.
"These detentions don't prevent
us from continuing trade union
activities," said Camay, back in
his office after two weeks of
solitary confinement. "We will go
about our business as much as
possible."
More than 120 major retail
stores have been struck by union
members demanding the release
of their leaders. The protests are
spreading to factories and com
mercial farms, and three phar
maceutical plants east of Johan
nesburg were struck yesterday.
Critical wage negotiations in the
mining, chemical and metal in
dustries have been seriously af
fected.
The country's major labor fed
eration, the multi-racial, 550,000-

member Congress of South
African Trade Unions, plans to
test police pledges not to interfere
in legitimate union activities by
holding a public meeting here
next Tuesday.
But the government warned
yesterday that the state of emer
gency, which gives the police and
army almost martial law powers,
would be strictly enforced and not
lifted soon.

Council of Unions of South Africa
Louis le Grange, the hard-line
minister of law and order, told a
politieal rally that the government
had "determined to apply the state
of emergency and all its regula
tions relentlessly." Emergency
rule will be lifted, he said, only
after law and order and normal
government administration are
fully restored.
The police, using their emer
gency powers, closed the troubled

Kwandebele tribal homeland
northeast of Pretoria to everyone
without a home or job there and
imposed nighttime curfews on
black townships across most of the
northern Orange Free State.
In Kwandebele, where there has
been much fighting over the
homeland's plans to accept
nominal "independence" from
South Africa in December,
Brigadier C.M. van Niekerk, the
police commander, decreed that
"no person may play, loiter or
aimlessly remain on any public
road." That in effect makes it a
crime punishable by 10 years in
prison for an old man to sit by the
side of the road and watch the
passing traffic.
Five more blacks were reported
killed in the civil strife, bringing
the death toll to 66 by the govern
ment's count since the emergency
was imposed on June 12.
Two were killed in Sowcto in a
fight between militant youths and
migrant workers. The workers
were members of the largely Zulu
Inkatha political movement who
live in hostels there. The conser
vative hostel residents and the
Soweto youths have fought a
dozen times over the past year and
a half. Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha
Buthelezi, the Zulu leader and In
katha president, is scheduled to
speak in Soweto on Sunday, and
tension is rising there.
