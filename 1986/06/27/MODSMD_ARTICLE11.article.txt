# House vote seen as turning contra tide

### 
WASHINGTON - A top
Nicaraguan resistance leader said
yesterday the expected renewal of
U.S. assistance to the rebels will tilt
the political balance in his
homeland, leading to a popular in
surrection against the Sandinistas
and a massive increase in the insur
gent ranks.
Flanked at a news conference by
members of the political and mili
tary leadership of the resistance, Al
fonso Robelo, a member of the
original Sandinista junta, also
predicted "massive defections" from
the Sandinista cause and rebellions
within the Nicaraguan army.
Robelo's colleague in the United
Nicaraguan Opposition, Adolfo
Calero, said he is placing high
priority on using the U.S. aid
money to acquire shoulder-fired
missiles capable of bringing down
Soviet helicopter gunships that were
introduced into the conflict last
summer.
He said the gunships have
"changed the war" in the Sandinis
tas' favor. The contras also will seek
light anti-tank weapons, grenade
launchers and light machine guns
once, as expected, the U.S. arms
flow to the rebels resumes on Sept.
1, Calero said.
Robelo said, "The weapons will
balance the present situation, where
we are suffering from sophisticated
weapons that the Soviets have given
the Sandinistas."
The long-held view of the insur
gents is that they require reliable,
consistent support from the United

States in order to rally public
opinion in Nicaragua behind them.
Robelo suggested that Wednesday
night's 221-209 House vote in sup
port of President Reagan's $100 mil
lion aid proposal will enable the
rebels to turn the corner in their
struggle against the Sandinstas. Un
til now, Robelo said, the United
States had been engaging in a "yo
yo" policy with Congress, approving
some of Reagan's requests and
rejecting others.
The aid will involve $70 million
in military aid and $30 million in
non-lethal assistance. The rebels
have received no military aid in
more than two years.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-Kan.), said the House reversal of
its anti-contra vote in March was a
"long time coming" and predicted
the Senate will follow suit and ap
prove the aid package.
Senate Minority Leader Robert
Byrd (D-W.Va.), said h e was
surprised by the vote, particularly in
view of polls showing public opinion
running against the president's pro
posal by more than 2-1.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill said he was fearful that the
House vote was a prelude to the
eventual introduction of American
troops in Nicaragua.
Reflecting O'Neill's concern was
the approval Wednesday night of an
amendement that would bar any
U.S. personnel — civilian or mili
tary — from providing aid or train
ing to the contras in areas within 20
miles of the Nicaraguan border.
