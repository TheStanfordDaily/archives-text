$1 trillion budget for '87 set
WASHINGTON — Congress late yesterday ap
proved a fiscal 1987 spending plan that offers Presi
dent Reagan a difficult choice between standing by as
Congress chips away at his defense buildup or giving
up his opposition to higher taxes.
The budget, which limits total government spend
ing to just under $1 trillion, marks Congress' most
dramatic repudiation of Reagan's spending priorities
— his demands for defense increases and domestic
spending cuts. The House approved the plan 333-43.
The Senate adopted it on a voice vote with only a
handful of senators present.
To a large extent, Capitol Hill's boldness in oppos
ing the enormously popular president reflects its fears
of the fiscal and political chaos that may result if
Congress fails to meet the deficit-reduction goals of
the new Gramm-Rudman law.
Total defense spending is set at $292 billion in the
budget, a cut of $28 billion from Reagan's request for
$320 billion, or 8 percent after inflation.
Manion judgeship up in air
WASHINGTON — After a dramatic session of
risky moves and switched votes, the Senate left the
controversial Federal Appeals Court nomination of
Daniel Manion hanging by a thread yesterday.
Final action was postponed until Congress returns
from its Fourth of July recess. As matters stand now,
it appears that Vice President George Bush, serving
as the Senate's presiding officer, may be given an op
portunity to break a 50-50 tie and cast the deciding
vote in Man ion's favor.
President Reagan's nomination of Manion — a
conservative Indiana attorney accused by
Democratic-led opponents of being inexperienced
and extreme — for a seat on the U.S. 7th Circuit
Court of Appeals has been fought largely along par
tisan lines. In yesterday's voting, all but five
Republicans supported Manion, while all but two
Democrats opposed him.
Manion's backers say the dispute is ideological,
contending that Democrats oppose him because he is
too conservative. But Democrats, led by Sens. Joseph
Biden, Jr. (D-Del.), and Paul Simon (D-Ill.), insist
that the issue is not ideology but qualifications.
The nomination of Manion has become both a
symbolic and practical test of will for conservatives

and liberals that has focused as much on political
partisanship as on the judicial qualifications of the
nominee.
Those opposed to Man ion — charging that he is
not qualified and has comparatively limited legal
background — have maintained that the Senate must
draw the line at his nomination or risk seriously com
promising the nation's judicial standards.
Several liberal law professors have argued recently
that the Senate has a constitutional duty to maintain
ideological "balance" in the federal courts if Reagan
continues nominating conservatives for vacancies.
Chants mar Speakes speech
SANTA BARBARA — A handful of dem
onstrators protesting President Reagan's $100 million
aid package for Nicaraguan rebels attempted to force
their way into the press room at the Sheraton Hotel
here yesterday, interrupting a briefing by White
House spokesman Larry Speakes.
Chanting "stop the lies" and "stop the murder,"
the protesters broke a window in their attempt to gain
entry. Several reporters joined White House aides in
barring the door to the press room.
A hotel security guard arrested one demonstrator
who managed to enter the room. Local police called
by the White House dispersed the group of 30 or so a
half hour after the disturbance began.
When Speakes resumed his briefing, the protesters'
chants could still be heard in the background. "Larry
Speakes, Larry lies," they taunted, accusing reporters
of accepting the informational equivalent of "dog
food" in the briefing.
Federal judge faces ouster
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Com
mittee yesterday voted for impeachment of im
prisoned Nevada federal Judge Harry Claiborne, in
the first such proceeding since the panel's votes to
impeach Richard Nixon 12 years ago.
The committee approved four articles of impeach
ment against Claiborne, who is collecting $215 in
daily salary while in prison for tax evasion.
The impeachment votes sent the Claiborne
pioceeding to the full House. Committee Chairman
Peter Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.), said he would request a
vote by the end of July. The final step would be a
Senate trial.

onstrators protesting President Reagan's $100 million
aid package for Nicaraguan rebels attempted to force
their way into the press room at the Sheraton Hotel
here yesterday, interrupting a briefing by White
House spokesman Larry Speakes.
Chanting "stop the lies" and "stop the murder,"
the protesters broke a window in their attempt to gain
entry. Several reporters joined White House aides in
barring the door to the press room.
A hotel security guard arrested one demonstrator
who managed to enter the room. Local police called
by the White House dispersed the group of 30 or so a
half hour after the disturbance began.
When Speakes resumed his briefing, the protesters'
chants could still be heard in the background. "Larry
Speakes, Larry lies," they taunted, accusing reporters
of accepting the informational equivalent of "dog
food" in the briefing.
Federal judge faces ouster
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Com
mittee yesterday voted for impeachment of im
prisoned Nevada federal Judge Harry Claiborne, in
the first such proceeding since the panel's votes to
impeach Richard Nixon 12 years ago.
The committee approved four articles of impeach
ment against Claiborne, who is collecting $215 in
daily salary while in prison for tax evasion.
The impeachment votes sent the Claiborne
pioceeding to the full House. Committee Chairman
Peter Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.), said he would request a
vote by the end of July. The final step would be a
Senate trial.
