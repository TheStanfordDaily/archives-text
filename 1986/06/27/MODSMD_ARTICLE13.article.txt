Bomb injures 13 at Madrid airport
MADRID, Spain — A bomb exploded yesterday in a suitcase at the
El A 1 Israel Airlines check-in counter in Madrid's international air
port, injuring 13 people, police said.
Police said the suitcase belonged to the last passenger to check in for
El Al's Flight 396 to Tel Aviv. A police spokesman said that passenger
was arrested and was being questioned, but the spokesman refused to
disclose the passenger's name or nationality.
Barajas Airport Director Domingo Perez said the man who was ar
rested carried a Spanish passport, but a police source said the passport
could be false.
Soviets rip U.S. summit optimism
GENEVA, Switzerland — The chief U.S. and Soviet arms
negotiators disagreed here yesterday on the results of the just-recessed
talks, with the American giving the most optimistic assessment yet of
the prospects for a new agreement, while the Soviets bitterly attacked
his view as distorted.
U.S. Ambassador Max Kampelman, recognizing that significant
Soviet proposals had been made within the past month, expressed
hope that the session "has in some areas opened the way to a serious
dialogue which will narrow our differences and lead to agreement."
His optimism was echoed in a written statement from President
Reagan in Santa Barbara, where he is vacationing. Commenting on
the new Soviet proposals, Reagan said, "I am hopeful these proposals
signal the beginning of a serious Soviet effort to join us in actually re
ducing nuclear arms."
But the chief Soviet delegate, Viktor Karpov, charged that
"throughout the fifth round there have been no changes in the posi
tion of the U.S. delegation that would contribute to mutually accep
table agreements."
