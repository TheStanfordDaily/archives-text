## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Court may modify abortion precedent 
### 
At face value, it is easy to assume that the moderate character of the
Supreme Court will not change with the retirement of Chief justice
Warren Burger. With Associate Justice William Rehnquist replacing
Burger and U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Anton in Scalia replacing
Rehnquist, conservatives are replacing conservatives, therefore not al
tering the overall balance of the court. And with the Burger court's
ruling earlier this month reaffirming the 1973 decision legalizing
abortion, many pro-choice advocates see their cause as "safe" despite
the reshuffling.
Yet the issue of abortion is precisely where Rehnquist and Scalia
could make a difference.
Rehnquist is known for his affability and superb scholarship, in
contrast to Burger, who is considered somewhat aloof and abrasive. As
chief justice, Rehnquist has the intellectual and personal qualities to
form a solid consensus around his views. Scalia, noted for his wit, en
ergy and astute articulation of the conservative ideology, promises to
inject the court with new intellectual firepower. With Scalia and
Rehnquist as strong ideological allies, they could form a persuasive
team that is tough to beat, for both are known foes of abortion.
The fragile 5-4 majority of the Burger court's recent abortion deci
sion shows just how easily the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling could be
modified by a more persuasive articulation of the conservative view
point.
Roe vs. Wade extended to abortion the right to privacy, effectively
invalidating many state laws that deemed the operation a criminal of
fense.
In its June 11 decision, the court struck down a series of Pennsylva
nia regulations that required physicians to obtain the "informed con
sent" of patients by furnishing them with information about the detri
mental physical and psychological effects of abortion. In the majority
opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun wrote that the regulations would
"intimidate women into continuing pregnancies" and therefore
invade the patient's constitutional right to privacy.
For the time being, Roe vs. Wade does not seem to be in danger of
a total reversal. On the other hand, modification seems imminent. A
Rehnquist court could begin to narrow a woman's right to an abortion
by upholding laws that permit the operation only under certain cir
cumstances. In cases in which a fine line separates affirmation and
modification of Roe vs. Wade, the new court could easily impede a
woman's right to an abortion by a series of rcintcrpretations.
The 1973 ruling started with a 7-2 majority, and 13 years later its
support has dwindled to 5-4. Of course it's too early to tell what effect
the reshuffling will have on Supreme Court decisions, and President
Reagan's appointments have yet to be confirmed. But if Rehnquist
and Scalia stay consistent in their personalities and convictions, pro
choice activists — and women in general — may have something to
worry about.
