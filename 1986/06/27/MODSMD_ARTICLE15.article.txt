A recent comment about Tresid
der food service was made in a letter
to The Stanford Daily. 1 tried to
reach the author directly so that we
could discuss her concerns, but I
could not locate her. This is an at
tempt to address the issues raised in
her letter to the editor.
Users arc the number one priority
in all Tresidder food services. We
provide a number of vehicles for in
put so that wc can be responsive to
our clientele.
The easiest and most effective way
of voicing your opinion is to ask to
see one of the food service
managers. A manager is on duty at
all times and would be happy to hear
your comments.
The comment card system is an
other way users can provide feed
back. Suggestion boxes arc available
in all of the Tresidder dining areas.
The card travels to the appropriate
food service manager, where it
receives a prompt written response.
Changes are made in response to
written suggestions, for example,
granola is now available at breakfast.
Cilantro tomatoes, meat options and
cherry peppers are now on the salad
bar. Recipe cards listing all ingredi
ents are posted at each meal. Prices
on pre-made sandwiches were

reduccd. Wc rely on customer
opinion to improve our services.
In addition to the comment card
system, those who want to can join
the food committee or attend a
meeting. The charge of the group is
to review and monitor all the actions
of the food service. Food tastings are
routinely conducted, in addition to
price and new item approvals. The
committee played an important
decision-making role in Cafe a la
Cart.
Feedback from our users is impor
tant. I want your criticisms. With
out the help of our customers it
would he difficult to make needed
adjustments to the menu or service.
I am disappointed that more people
do not leave their names, phone
numbers or addresses on their sug
gestions so that I may respond per
sonally. The door to my office is al
ways open (located in room 254
Tresidder Union) or call "23-4321.
Lx:t me hear from you.
