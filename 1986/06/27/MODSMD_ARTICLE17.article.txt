# Burger gives society a bad grade
## 
### 
After announcing his plan to retire, Supreme Court
Chief Justice Warren Burger commented June 15 on the
position of the Supreme Court. Although most of his
statements were concerned with the court's effective
ness, Burger inadvertently placed society in the defen
dant's seat for aiding and abetting the decline in the Su
preme Court.
By criticizing the case in which a mother sued the
educational system because her son received a B grade
instead of an A, Burger seemed to view the judicial sys
tem's weaknesses as responsible for such an outlandish
occurrence. The evidence would indicate, however, the
system's innocence, implicating society instead.

Today, it seems, judgment infatuates most
Americans, whether handed down by the Supreme
Court or given as a letter grade on a report card. A
grade, after all, reflects only the teacher's judgment of
the student's achievement within the classroom. What
about the activity occurring beyond the teacher's staked
out realm? Burger condemns us for having tailing judg
ment.
We place equally undue emphasis on grades and
recognition. We should, instead, concern ourselves
more with the occurrences in everyday life. Attributes
such as consistent courtesy, the giving of well-intended
remarks, and the pleasant nature of one's own company,
contribute to a person's true wealth much more than a
4.0 GPA — or they should.
Let's call the defendant to the stand and find out by
asking him some questions. Since when is a single grade
worth the time and effort, not to mention the money, it
takes to bring a case to the Supreme Court? Isn't a B,
after all, indicative of a better-than-average level of
achievement in school? How is it, then, that a parent
might feel the need to sue for a better grade?
Most parents today provide their children with more
support than was given in previous generations, in the
hope that they will have an "advantage" over others.
College preparation is key, and many feel that without
it a high school career is fo^iaught.
-We at Stanford should have risen above preoccupa

tion with the letter grade. Oh yes, society is definitely
guilty of grade-worship, but we — never! Besides the
fact that we cannot deny our membership in our society
— no matter how much we would like to do so, stronger
evidence implicates us as partners in crime.
Venturing through the halls of any campus house or
dormitory misleads the visiting observer. Greeted by
smiling faces and hearing of weekend plans for Santa
Cruz or even Tahoe, the visitor thinks that Stanford is
the playpen in the college network of think tanks. The
witness, however, has been fooled by our conspiracy.
At Stanford, the grade receives an unusual amount of
reverence. To mention the word "grade" is almost blas
phemous. We all "know" that a mere word fails to con
vey adequately the power of another human being's
opinion over our fate. That opinion has the potential to
sentence us to the life of a well-paid career in a rising
corporation or condemn us to work in a low-paid, per
haps monotonous position. It can mean that we're good,
outstanding or even bad, and that terrifies us.
Why else would over 6,000 undergraduates assume
another personality, often simultaneously, according to
the ebb and flow of, no, not lunar tides, but rather mid
term schedules and project due dates. Most do not pride
themselves on the Hydes that occasionally venture from
personalized cages within all of us, ravaging terror on all
in their path. Yet many view Hyde's release as a neces
sary evil, a prerequisite, if you will, to obtaining the
glorified A.
We therefore may be accused of being "overly
desirous of recognition" and conspiring to appear other
wise. What are the implications of such a charge? First,
it indicates that we place the value of a grade — a mark
on a measuring stick — higher on our list of values than
a consistently content personality. And secondly, may
the prosecution assert that the time devoted to develop
ing a Jcckyll and Hyde character, rather than a single
and preferably more pleasant personality provides
evidence of the defendant's selfish nature? The tes
timony upholds this assertion.
The defendant, therefore, stands accused not only of
being "overly desirous of recognition," but also of
"selfishly pursuing such recognition." As the court, I
sentence the defendants to live with his or her own Hyde
for a period of six months, without relief, in the hope
that we will learn that this evil is intolerable, and that
this knowledge will inspire us forever to contain Hyde in
his or her cage.
The court is now adjourned.
