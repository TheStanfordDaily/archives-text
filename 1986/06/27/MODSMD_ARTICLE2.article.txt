A chemical spill in a section of
Palo Alto's Matadero Creek
resurfaced early yesterday morning
contaminating a section of the Stan
ford Industrial Park, according to
Palo Alto Fire Chief Robert Wall.
The creek is created by storm run
off that travels into San Fran
cisco Bay and is not used for drink
ing purposes, Wall said.
The exact source of the spill,
which first surfaced Saturday, is still
unknown but is somewhere between
El Camino Real, Page Mill Road
and Hanover Street, he said.
The oily substance, which has a
"light sheen," has yet to be identi
fied, but according to lab analyses to
date, the industrial solvent contains
0.9 parts per billion trichlorethylene
(TCE) and 0.4 parts per billion
trichlorethane (TCA), according to
Wall. The Santa Clara Water Dis

trict has deemed five parts per bil
lion of I CE to be a health hazard
and 200 parts per billion of TCA to
be a health risk, he said.
As a precautionary measure, the
water flow in.the contaminated sec
tion of the creek has been dammed,
Wall said. Plastic pipes have been
installed to regulate the flow.
Wall said the source of the spill
has been a storm drain system seven
feet underground, but the exact lo
cation will not be confirmed until
the lab results are finalized. He
would not speculate as to whether
any of the companies on the Stan
ford land are responsible for the con
tamination.
Wall has contacted the Environ
mental Protection Agency, the
Santa Clara Water District, the
Santa Clara Office of Emergenccy
Services and the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office to
