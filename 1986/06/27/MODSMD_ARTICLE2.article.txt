# Toxic chemicals found in creek

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
A chemical spill in a section of
Palo Alto's Matadero Creek
resurfaced early yesterday morning
contaminating a section of the Stan
ford Industrial Park, according to
Palo Alto Fire Chief Robert Wall.
The creek is created by storm run
off that travels into San Fran
cisco Bay and is not used for drink
ing purposes, Wall said.
The exact source of the spill,
which first surfaced Saturday, is still
unknown but is somewhere between
El Camino Real, Page Mill Road
and Hanover Street, he said.
The oily substance, which has a
"light sheen," has yet to be identi
fied, but according to lab analyses to
date, the industrial solvent contains
0.9 parts per billion trichlorethylene
(TCE) and 0.4 parts per billion
trichlorethane (TCA), according to
Wall. The Santa Clara Water Dis

trict has deemed five parts per bil
lion of I CE to be a health hazard
and 200 parts per billion of TCA to
be a health risk, he said.
As a precautionary measure, the
water flow in.the contaminated sec
tion of the creek has been dammed,
Wall said. Plastic pipes have been
installed to regulate the flow.
Wall said the source of the spill
has been a storm drain system seven
feet underground, but the exact lo
cation will not be confirmed until
the lab results are finalized. He
would not speculate as to whether
any of the companies on the Stan
ford land are responsible for the con
tamination.
Wall has contacted the Environ
mental Protection Agency, the
Santa Clara Water District, the
Santa Clara Office of Emergenccy
Services and the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office to
investigate the spill.
Wall said this is a routine proce
dure, adding that he will be meeting
with the Santa Clara Water District
and State Regional Water Quality
Control Board, "the experts," today
to determine the next course of ac
tion.
It will be up to the agencies as to
whether the spill needs to be cleaned
up at all, Wall said.
Wall also said that the material
found is similar to the chemicals
that leaked from an underground

tank outside the Watkins/Johnson
plant earlier this year. But "it is too
early to tell whether this or any other
former event was responsible for the
chemicals found now, he said.
Wall said it is not within his juris
diction to determine whether Stan
ford, a third party, would be held re
sponsible. The University does not
have any industries of its own on the
property, but does lease out the
land. He said that there is both a
state law and a local ordinance that
hold the guilty party financially
reponsible for any costs involved.
According to the Times Tribune,
Varien, one of the closest compan
ies to the creek, has agreed to assist
in investigating the spill.
