## New drug, alcohol center opens here 
### STACEY ATTANASIO Staff writer 
Most drug addicts and alcoholics
have one thing in common: they
want nothing more than to
overcome their chemical obsession.
And for many who try again and
again, living clean seems
impossible.
Although most alcoholics and ad
dicts share common problems and
desires, doctors here say treatment
must be tailored to individual needs
to be effective.
A new Alcohol and Drug Treat
ment Center opened here three
weeks ago under the co-direction of
Drs. Robert Matano and William
Hazle.
Unlike most treatment centers
that require standard 28-day stays,
Stanford's center will vary the length
of inpatient hospitalization with in
dividual patient needs. Matano and
Hazle say they have based their pro
gram on a developmental theory of
recovery, a model developed here by
Dr. Stephanie Brown.
The 13-bed inpatient center, lo
cated in the Hoover Pavilion, works
in conjunction with the Stanford Al
cohol Clinic, an outpatient care
facility. The nine-year-old clinic
recently moved its offices to the new
Medical School Office Building.
Founded in 1977 by Brown, the
outpatient clinic offers services to
more than 200 patients each month.
The clinic is nationally known for its
work with adult children of al
coholics.
The new Alcohol and Drug
Treatment Center is the product of

joint efforts by the University and
Stanford Hospital. In addition to
providing patient care, the center
provides for University training and
research.
Dr. Matano stressed the need to
evaluate individual needs in
prescribing inpatient care. "Some
people may not need inpatient care,
or some may need three days or four
weeks," he said. "We vary the
length of stay based on a compre
hensive evaluation process of medi
cal, social, emotional and familial
supports, and tailor each program to
that need."
Dr. Hazle said that in some cases
inpatient service is essential and out
patient service alone may not be
enough. "This center provides a
safe, protective, drug-free environ
ment when the temptation or desire
is too strong," he said.
The combination of inpatient and
outpatient care is one of the keys to
effective individualized patient treat
ment, according to the doctors.
Outpatient services generally last
more than a year, Dr. Hazle said.
The program may include two or
three weeks of inpatient care, fol
lowed by five weeks of daily three
hour meetings, and finally a year
long series of weekly group
meetings, he said.
This structure differs from other
inpatient centers because "there is
no rush to get them out in two to
three weeks," Dr. Hazle said.
"The transition in other centers
from a month of hospitalization to a
week of hour-and-a-half group
meetings is too large," he explained.
"In [our] method, we have a shorter

inpatient stay, which is intense over
the beginning, and then the five
weeks of daily evaluation and in
tense therapy, which gradually
tapers off, compared to the [other]
more drastic transition."
Extended outpatient treatment
may be necessary for those who
become "too ill during withdrawal
or who are too unstable," Hazle
said.
The development theory of
recovery, which focuses on a long
term model of treatment, distin
guishes three levels of care: acute,
structured outpatient and long-term
outpatient, Dr. Matano said.

Depending on individual progress,
patients may move from one phase
to the next.
"Based on our knowledge of ad
diction, this long-term rehabilita
tion treatment makes more sense,"
Dr. Hazle said. "So far, it seems to
be going very well. A number of the
staff have worked on other inpatient
units and this one behaves and feels
different â€” because of how intense
it is.
"The patient is here for a short
period ... so people behave differ
ently and problems seem to surface
more quickly. There is an inherent
resistance to treatment which

surfaces the second or third day
here," he said.
Costs for the entire 14-month
program, which includes both in
patient and outpatient therapies, is
about $9,000, most of which is cov
ered by major medical insurance,
the doctors said.
About a quarter of the clinic's
patients come from the Stanford
community, Dr. Matano said. Hoping
to service the Stanford community,
to "take care of our own," Dr. Hazle
encouraged any student, faculty,
staff or employee to call 723-6682 to
discuss a personal problem or that of
a friend.


The new Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center is accepting its first patients this month under the direction of Dr.
William Hazle (shown) and Dr. Robert Matano. About 25 percent of the center's patients come from the Stan
ford community.
