## 'Normal Heart' overpreaches its message 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
Although "The Normal Heart," a
play about AIDS by Larry Kramer,
tells a "true life" story filled with
hard facts and deep emotions, it is
still an overwritten, preachy and un
theatrical play that often struggles to
hold the audience's attention.
The play opened last week as the
first show of the Berkeley Repertory
Theatre's summer season. A contro
versial play off-Broadway, it has
played in London, and now appro
priately, in San Francisco.
Kramer has created an
autobiographical portrait of his fight
to raise funds for the treatment of
AIDS. But the problem with the
play lies mostly with the writing, not
the theme.
The action takes place between
1982 and 1984 in New York City,
focusing on Ned Weeks, a
"loudmouth" gay activist, who
watches his friends die of a mysteri
ous disease. The doctors have no
idea of what's going on, nor do they

want to.
Every authority from City Hall to
the American Medical Association
refuses to acknowledge the situation
because acquired immune
deficiency is a "gay" disease. Enter
Weeks, who starts a volunteer or
ganization and hotline to help AIDS
victims. Complementing the public
politics of his life is his private
romance with Felix, a journalist for
The New York Times. The drama is
heightened when Felix contracts
AIDS and eventually dies.
With this plot Kramer scores
some good points. In addition to
giving a multitude of information
about AIDS, he points out the
public authorities' refusal to ac
knowledge one of the deadliest
diseases known to man because they
consider it to be a "gay" disease. His
mouthpiece, Weeks, also delivers an
eloquent monologue in the second
act about wanting gay men to recog
nize their heritage "from Aristotle to
Auden" rather than unifying only by


Ihe Berkeley Repertory Theatre's performance of "The Normal Heart" tackles the controversial topic of AIDS.
The show wins praise for its informative merit, but falls short in its theatrical power and captivation.
way ot sex.
"To stop thinking with their cocks" and more with
their minds is the argument put forth by Kramer and
Weeks, and the threat of AIDS is a convincing vehicle
to portray this argument.
Overall, however, the script is weak. Weeks appropri
ately seethes with anger and frustration, but his seething
lasts for such an extended period of time that no other
human element can get in edgewise. Weeks, the un
heard prophet, is a very unlikeable person and con
sciously so.
The audience is supposed to say, "Oh, Weeks is so
right, and those bureaucrats are so bad." But such
simplistic manipulation made me uneasy, and even
though I knew Weeks was right, I disliked his preachy
anger so much I wished he wasn't. I kept thinking he
would have a revelation, a development in character,
but no such luck. While the other characters evolve in
one way or another, Weeks remains from start to finish
the same angry, stubborn fighter.
This is simply my personal reaction to the central
character the audience is asked to sympathize with. On
a more general level, though, the structure of the play is
what disturbed me most. The scenes repeat the same
ideas, invariably ending up with a group of people sit
ting around debating one of the given issues: the
Holocaust, sex and the origins of homosexuality. It's not
that these subjects don't make good theater, it's just
Kramer's script treats them all in the same tone, at the
same emotional level.
Time after time Weeks becomes the angry intellec
tual screaming and crying while his dialogue partner

becomes a backboard supplying teed lines and oc
casional one-liners for comic relief. The tone is always
the same: militant and polemical. This may be appro
priate for AIDS awareness, but consistency and repeti
tion mean dull theater. In an attempt to justify such
repetition, Kramer adds "personal history" segments,
but more often than not, this becomes mushy
melodrama rather than urgent drama.
As always, there are qualifications to my charge of
"untheatricality." The second act is much better than
the first, particularly when the focus shifts from Weeks
to other members of the cast. Richard Rossi as a scared
gay civil rights veteran and Jeff King as a nervous gay
businessman both deliver stirring monologues late in
the show. Chuck Lafon plays a "Southern bitch" who
turns out to be steady as a rock and our audience
plcaser. Jarion Monroe turns in the most confident and
relaxed performance as Ned's straight brother.
While parts of the second act drew me in, the play
remained a flawed one with which the cast did an ade
quate job. For the caliber of productions normally asso
ciated with the Repertory, this is below par. The
topicality of "The Normal Heart," however, rises above
the theatrical weaknesses, and I would recommend the
show to anyone who would like to know more about
AIDS sufferers, as well as the overall facts and figures
about this deadly disease.
Although it is an informative and occasionally spel
lbinding show, I cannot excuse the playwright's un
restrained self-righteousness. For a man who would like
"a new definition of what it is to be gay" — a definition
that is more "cultural" than "sexual" — why does he
have one of his most sympathetic characters die with the
wish to be remembered as Ned's "lover?" It is a small
detail, but one which leads to skepticism about Kramer's
vision.
