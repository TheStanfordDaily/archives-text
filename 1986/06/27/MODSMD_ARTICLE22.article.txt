## 'Normal Heart' overpreaches its message 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
Although "The Normal Heart," a
play about AIDS by Larry Kramer,
tells a "true life" story filled with
hard facts and deep emotions, it is
still an overwritten, preachy and un
theatrical play that often struggles to
hold the audience's attention.
The play opened last week as the
first show of the Berkeley Repertory
Theatre's summer season. A contro
versial play off-Broadway, it has
played in London, and now appro
priately, in San Francisco.
Kramer has created an
autobiographical portrait of his fight
to raise funds for the treatment of
AIDS. But the problem with the
play lies mostly with the writing, not
the theme.
The action takes place between
1982 and 1984 in New York City,
focusing on Ned Weeks, a
"loudmouth" gay activist, who
watches his friends die of a mysteri
ous disease. The doctors have no
idea of what's going on, nor do they

want to.
Every authority from City Hall to
the American Medical Association
refuses to acknowledge the situation
because acquired immune
deficiency is a "gay" disease. Enter
Weeks, who starts a volunteer or
ganization and hotline to help AIDS
victims. Complementing the public
politics of his life is his private
romance with Felix, a journalist for
The New York Times. The drama is
heightened when Felix contracts
AIDS and eventually dies.
With this plot Kramer scores
some good points. In addition to
giving a multitude of information
about AIDS, he points out the
public authorities' refusal to ac
knowledge one of the deadliest
diseases known to man because they
consider it to be a "gay" disease. His
mouthpiece, Weeks, also delivers an
eloquent monologue in the second
act about wanting gay men to recog
nize their heritage "from Aristotle to
Auden" rather than unifying only by


Ihe Berkeley Repertory Theatre's performance of "The Normal Heart" tackles the controversial topic of AIDS.
The show wins praise for its informative merit, but falls short in its theatrical power and captivation.
