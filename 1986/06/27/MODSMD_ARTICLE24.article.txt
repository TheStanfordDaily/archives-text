## Mayotte, Fendick and Co. make noise in England 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff 
A former Stanford athlete has
been labeled as the United States'
only remaining hope of winning the
men's championship at Wimbledon
this year. And no, he is not John
McEnroe.
McEnroe, the perennial No. 1
seed at Wimbledon, passed up the
tournament this year in favor of
raising his new child. Jimmy Con
nors, America's other big name, was
upset in the first round Monday by
countryman Robert Seguso in four
sets.
That leaves Tim Mayotte to hold
down the fort. Mayotte, who won
the NCAA men's singles title in
1981 while playing for Stanford, has
breezed through the first two rounds
at Wimbledon. His most recent ef
fort was a 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) victory
over Jonathan Canter on Wednes
day.
Mayotte made the semi-finals in
Wimbledon in 1982, his first pro
season. That year, McEnroe ended
Mayotte's title hopes, and he has
failed to come as close since.

This year, however, Mayotte has
hit Wimbledon in full stride. Earlier
this month, he won the champion
ship at Queens, a tournament in
England used as a tune-up for
Wimbledon.
Also to Mayotte's advantage is a
somewhat weaker field than in the
past. Not only are McEnroe and
Connors out, but Ivan Lendl is not a
strong grasscourt player, and Becker
has been struggling lately.
In fact, NBC analyst Bud Collins
went as far as to say that Mayotte,
along with Sweden's Stefan Edberg,
are the two most consistent grass
court players in the tournament.
English fans are taking this advice to
heart and have made Mayotte one of
the betting favorites.
While Mayotte is making a name
for himself in the men's bracket,
Stanford is being well-represented at
Wimbledon in women's singles
also.
Patty Fendick, who won the
women's singles title at the NCAA
championships last month and will
return for her senior year at Stanford
in the fall, was victorious Wednes
day in her first-round match at

Wimbledon. She knocked off Beth
Herr, 6-3, 6-1.
Last year, Fendick advanced
through the first three rounds at
Wimbledon before losing a
heartbreaking three-set match to
West Germany's Stefi Graf.
Elise Burgin, who played with
Fendick 011 the 1984 Stanford
women's team which went unde
feated and captured the national
championship, knocked off Ronni
Reis of the University of Miami in
second-round action yesterday, 6-1,
7-5.
Alycia Moulton won her first
round match Wednesday at
Wimbledon 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 over
Czechoslovakia's Katerina Skronska.
While at Stanford, Moulton won
the NCAA doubles crown in 1979
(with Kathy Jordan) and 1981 (with
Caryn Copeland) and captured the
singles title in 1982.
Kate Gompert, who played on the
1982 and 1984 championship Stan
ford teams and is currently ranked in
the top 20 in the world, retired in
her first-round match while trailing
6-2, 1-0 to the No. 8 seed, Manuela
Maleeva.
