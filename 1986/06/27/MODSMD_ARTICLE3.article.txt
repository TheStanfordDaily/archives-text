# Free South Africa Fund reaches $2,800 mark

### DAVE RAMOS 
With the recent gift of $1,500 from the
1986 Senior Class, the Free South Africa
Fund reached $2,800, but it is still too early to
judge the impact of the trust, according to one
of the fund's trustees.
The fund is "an educational act, if nothing
else," according to English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, a trustee of the fund.
He said he remains "quite hopeful" that the
fund will have a major impact.
Established through the ASSU last month
by Stanford's three 1985-6 Rhodes scholars,
the fund will be released to the University only
after Stanford divests totally from companies
doing business in the apartheid-ruled country
or when the black majority there has the poli
tical power to determine its future.

The trust "has sent a signal to the adminis
tration that there is a group of alums con
cerned with the U investment
policy," according to William Handley, a
recent graduate and one of the Rhodes
scholars who established the fund.
Contributions are expected to increase
when the trust is publicized in the June issue
of the alumni-oriented Stanford Observer,
Rebholz said. The administrators of the trust
also plan to compile a mailing list of potential
alumni donors to the fund, he said.
The founders of the trust, including Rhodes
scholars Michael McFaul and Susan Rice in
addition to Handley, said they created the
fund in response to the University's policy of
selective divestment.
Both Rebholz and Handley said they were

pleased that a San Francisco law firm, Mor
rison and Foerster, agreed to contribute by
taking care of the legal aspects of the trust fund
free of charge.
The Senior Class gift to the fund, presented
at Senior Class Day June 14, was prompted by
a "considerable demand on campus and spe
cifically within the class ... for an affirmative
statement of Stanford support for progressive
change in South Africa," Senior Class Presi
dents Leslie Darwin, Kim Oden, Patrick
Shannon and Stephen Smith said in a press
release.
But University President Donald Kennedy
has been critical of the fund.
The the senior class gift was "a precedent
destined to present difficulties for us in the
future," Kennedy told The Daily.
According to Handley, Kennedy

"trivialized" the fund issue in his Senior Class
Day address. Handley said Kennedy implied
tlÂ»e fund-was another cause" by compar
ing it to issues such as experimentation on lab
oratory animals.
Handley said although he disagrees with
Kennedy's stance, he was pleased that Ken
nedy devoted a large porton of his speech to
the trust.
In his speech, Kennedy cautioned against
making institutional support conditional on
"single-issue politics."
"To fail to nourish (the University) because
it is wrong in some particular dimension is, 1
think, to miss the point," he said.
The fund is currently being administered by
the ASSU, but will be transferred next spring
to a board of trustees when independent, non
profit status has been attained.
