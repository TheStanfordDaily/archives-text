# Herman due up for deportation hearing
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Editorial staff 
A Salvadoran refugee who found
sanctuary in several dorms on
campus this spring will face a depor
tation hearing in late July, according
to his attorney.
Jan Austerlitz, a lawyer with the
Father Moriarty Central American
Refugee Program, told The Daily
Wednesday that the refugee, known
only as Herman, will appear July 30
at the San Francisco Immigration
Court. The hearing will determine
whether Herman will be granted po
litical asylum in this country.
The Father Moriarty program
represents Salvadoran and
Guatemalan refugees in asylum
hearings and arranges bond for their
release.
Herman's defense will rest on the
fact that if he is returned to El Sal
vador, he will be "killed or tortured
or detained because of what he's
done [in El Salvador] and in the
United States," Austerlitz said.
"Herman has been very visible in his
opposition to the Salvadoran gov
ernment."
In the hearing, Herman will "talk

about everything that happened to
him and why he can't go back," she
said.
In an interview with The Daily in
April, Herman said through an in
terpreter that he left his family and
his native country four years ago
after his brother and two friends
were assassinated by government
forces.
"I left because of the persecution
and murders that were going on in
discriminately in my country," he
said.
Herman arrived at Stanford April
10 to stay at Columbae House after
dorm residents declared their
cooperative a sanctuary for Central
American refugees. Herman's stay
sparked controversy with the Uni
versity administration over its policy
that limits guests to a three-day stay
in at any particular University
residence.
In an interview with The Daily on
Wednesday, Herman said he spent a
month at Stanford, staying in
Columbae, Casa Zapata, Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity and Casa
Italiana, as well as speaking to
hundreds of students about his expe
riences.
When asked what he thought of
Stanford and the people he met,
Herman said, "very good, very
nice."
He said he is now living in Menlo
Park "with Salvadoran people."
According to Austerlitz, "Herman
has a pretty strong case, but (he has)
the toughest judge as well." Al
though only about 3 percent of the
Central American refugees are
granted asylum nationally, "San
Francisco has a much higher rate,"
she said.
The Father Moriarty program has
a 50 percent overall success rate with
deportation cases, she added.
If Herman does not win his case,
Austerlitz said they will appeal the
decision to the Board of Immigra
tion Appeals. If denied, they plan to
take the case to the 9th Circuit

Court of Appeals.
Herman was arrested by San
Francisco immigration officials in
the spring of 1983, according to
Austerlitz. It usually takes from one
to three years for a case to come to

court, depending on the judge and
the circumstances of the case, she
said.
Herman is the founder of the
Committee of Refugees from El Sal

vador (CORES), a Palo Alto-based
group that coordinates "both direct
service to new refugees in the area
and [gives] aid to persons still in El
Salvador or in refugee camps outside
of El Salvador," according to Jodie
Sleeper, office coordinator of the
South Bay Sanctuary Covenant, lo
cated at St. Ann's Chapel in Palo
Alto.
" T he odds aren't that good" that
Herman will be given asylum,
Sleeper said.
"We can't give political asylum to
[Salvadorans] because it's against
our foreign policy," she said, refer
ring to U.S. aid to the Salvadoran
government.
The South Bay Sanctuary Cove
nant works with CORES to aid
refugees, and the two organizations
have established joint committees,
Sleeper said.
According to Sleeper, the
majority of the Central American
refugees in this area live in East Palo
Alto and the southern part of Red
wood City.
