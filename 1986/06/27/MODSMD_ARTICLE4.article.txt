A Salvadoran refugee who found
sanctuary in several dorms on
campus this spring will face a depor
tation hearing in late July, according
to his attorney.
Jan Austerlitz, a lawyer with the
Father Moriarty Central American
Refugee Program, told The Daily
Wednesday that the refugee, known
only as Herman, will appear July 30
at the San Francisco Immigration
Court. The hearing will determine
whether Herman will be granted po
litical asylum in this country.
The Father Moriarty program
represents Salvadoran and
Guatemalan refugees in asylum
hearings and arranges bond for their
release.
Herman's defense will rest on the
fact that if he is returned to El Sal
vador, he will be "killed or tortured
or detained because of what he's
done [in El Salvador] and in the
United States," Austerlitz said.
"Herman has been very visible in his
opposition to the Salvadoran gov
ernment."
In the hearing, Herman will "talk

about everything that happened to
him and why he can't go back," she
said.
In an interview with The Daily in
April, Herman said through an in
terpreter that he left his family and
his native country four years ago
after his brother and two friends
were assassinated by government
forces.
"I left because of the persecution
and murders that were going on in
discriminately in my country," he
said.
Herman arrived at Stanford April
10 to stay at Columbae House after
dorm residents declared their
cooperative a sanctuary for Central
American refugees. Herman's stay
sparked controversy with the Uni
versity administration over its policy
that limits guests to a three-day stay
in at any particular University
residence.
In an interview with The Daily on
Wednesday, Herman said he spent a
month at Stanford, staying in
Columbae, Casa Zapata, Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity and Casa
Italiana, as well as speaking to
