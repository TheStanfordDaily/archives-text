# Cowell isn't students' mom
## Patients complain about insensitive treatment by staff 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
When a graduate student in electrical engineering
gashed his forehead on the metal edge of a door last
quarter, he rushed promptly to Cowell Student
Health Center for first aid. Unable to enter the build
ing, he noticed the doorbell was broken, and the ad
jacent phone was also out of service. He was able to
repair the phone and managed to call and surprise a
nurse who knew the phone had not been working
earlier that evening. Though the bleeding still had
not stopped, he was required to fill out a form before
receiving treatment.
The nurse then examined the laceration and
cleaned it with some rubbing alcohol, which "really
hurt," he says. The student was sent home without
stitches or any sort of dressing. The next day he went
to a clinic in Palo Alto where he was told, "It's too
late for stitches."
A portion of the fees paid by students to Stanford
each quarter are allocated to the Cowell Student
Health Center. Registered students may receive ur
gent care, professional psychological counseling, and
medical examinations at no charge. For many stu
dents, especially those living on campus, Cowell is
the only health care facility readily available, and
when immediate medical attention is required,
Cowell is usually the closest. Despite its conveni
ence, students have often left Cowell dissatisfied with

the treatment they received.
One Friday last autumn, Carol Lee, a sophomore,
sprained her ankle during a volleyball game. At
Cowell, a nurse gave her crutches and an ace
bandage and advised her to "come back Monday"
when a doctor would be available. On Monday, the
doctor asked her if it hurt, to which she replied that it
hurt very much. The doctor recommended she "not
do anything drastic for the next four to six weeks."
Months later her sprained ankle was still painful. And
now, more than seven months later, it still remains
noticeably larger than the uninjured ankle. "But it's
getting smaller," she says.
According to Lee, there was a "general no-big-deal
attitude" at Cowell. The nurses seemed more at
tentive, while the doctor seemed to do very little very
quickly. "He really didn't do anything," she recalls.
She left feeling as if she had bothered the staff with
something trivial, wasting their time as well as hers.
"Perhaps it really was no big deal," she says, "but it
seemed important enough for me to go over there. "
Because injuries are often treated lightly "I think for
big things, people by to avoid Cowell."
Confronted with the cases of the sprained ankle
and the gashed forehead, Dr. Paul Walters, director
of the health center, replies "sprained ankles are the
most common injuries among students that Cowell
treats, and frequently, ankle injuries are painful and
