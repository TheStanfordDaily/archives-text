# Cowell isn't students' mom
## Patients complain about insensitive treatment by staff 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
When a graduate student in electrical engineering
gashed his forehead on the metal edge of a door last
quarter, he rushed promptly to Cowell Student
Health Center for first aid. Unable to enter the build
ing, he noticed the doorbell was broken, and the ad
jacent phone was also out of service. He was able to
repair the phone and managed to call and surprise a
nurse who knew the phone had not been working
earlier that evening. Though the bleeding still had
not stopped, he was required to fill out a form before
receiving treatment.
The nurse then examined the laceration and
cleaned it with some rubbing alcohol, which "really
hurt," he says. The student was sent home without
stitches or any sort of dressing. The next day he went
to a clinic in Palo Alto where he was told, "It's too
late for stitches."
A portion of the fees paid by students to Stanford
each quarter are allocated to the Cowell Student
Health Center. Registered students may receive ur
gent care, professional psychological counseling, and
medical examinations at no charge. For many stu
dents, especially those living on campus, Cowell is
the only health care facility readily available, and
when immediate medical attention is required,
Cowell is usually the closest. Despite its conveni
ence, students have often left Cowell dissatisfied with

the treatment they received.
One Friday last autumn, Carol Lee, a sophomore,
sprained her ankle during a volleyball game. At
Cowell, a nurse gave her crutches and an ace
bandage and advised her to "come back Monday"
when a doctor would be available. On Monday, the
doctor asked her if it hurt, to which she replied that it
hurt very much. The doctor recommended she "not
do anything drastic for the next four to six weeks."
Months later her sprained ankle was still painful. And
now, more than seven months later, it still remains
noticeably larger than the uninjured ankle. "But it's
getting smaller," she says.
According to Lee, there was a "general no-big-deal
attitude" at Cowell. The nurses seemed more at
tentive, while the doctor seemed to do very little very
quickly. "He really didn't do anything," she recalls.
She left feeling as if she had bothered the staff with
something trivial, wasting their time as well as hers.
"Perhaps it really was no big deal," she says, "but it
seemed important enough for me to go over there. "
Because injuries are often treated lightly "I think for
big things, people by to avoid Cowell."
Confronted with the cases of the sprained ankle
and the gashed forehead, Dr. Paul Walters, director
of the health center, replies "sprained ankles are the
most common injuries among students that Cowell
treats, and frequently, ankle injuries are painful and
slow to respond among active students." He
says he "wouldn't he surprised if the ankle hurt
after four to six months."
For a sprain, he says, "itis a big deal. There
is just not much anyone can do." If it wasn't
healing well, Lee could have gone back to
Co well for physical therapy. Golf carts arc also
available for injured students who need to get
around campus.
However, Dr. Walters seemed rather
surprised that the student with the forehead in
jury did not receive stitches.
According to a nurse at the reception desk,
if a student is truly in need of immediate
medical treatment, he is treated right away.

However, there is a sign that instructs patients
who require "urgent care" to fill out a form
from the receptionist. The purpose of this
form is to establish the student's registration
and to give the staff some background to the
nature of the illness or injury. In emergency
cases, the patient is treated upon arrival, and
they "worry about the forms later," she says.
Dr. Walters is somewhat familiar with stu
dents criticism ofCowell. He said he receives
most complaints second-hand in the form of
horror stories someone told someone else. Dr.
Walters says that it seems that students are
more apt to tell their friends about bad experi
ences than to direct complaints to the staff. In
stead, he says he would like to know personally
when a student is dissatisfied with services

received at Cowell. His office is down the hall
from the reception desk, and he encourages
students to speak with him.
Dr. Walters says he believes that student in
put at Cowell is very important. "It's frustrat
ing to hear complaints second-hand," he says.
"It perpetuates the myth that we don't care."
Dr. Walters is in the process of forming a
student advisory committee to serve as a
liaison between University students and the
health center. He says he is also very open to
the idea of having a student ombudsperson to
speak with fellow students about complaints.
Regarding the insensitivity of the staff to pa
tient discomfort, Dr. Walters says he believes
"something can be done about that."

Cowell, in its attempt to improve service to
students, offers many programs most students
are unaware of. For example, using computers
at LOTS, students can call Cowell for medical
advice via its Health Net program. Free ad
vice regarding contraception is available, and
various contraceptives may be purchased
through Cowell at a discount. Students may
also be treated for allergies there.
Last spring, a survey was mailed to random
students complete with self-addressed,
postage-paid envelopes. Another survey assess
ing student satisfaction will be distributed this
fall. Biographies of Cowell staff will soon be
available in the waiting areas so that students
will know more about the doctors, nurses and
counselors treating them.
