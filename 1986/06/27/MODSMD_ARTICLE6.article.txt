# Saga takeover won't have sudden effects
## 
### MARTHA MOODY 
Although Saga Corporation —•
a major University food service
contractor — has accepted a $502
million buyout offer from Mar
riott Corporation, the takeover
probably will not affect the Stan
ford community in the short
term, according to managers of
both companies.
Any changes in management
or staff will occur only after Mar
riott managers visit "the various
operations and the people that are
running them," according to
Terry Souers, Marriott director of
corporate relations.

The takeover occurred June
10.
"Everything will stay the same
at [the Stanford] level," said
Tresidder Food Service Director
Sue Tatum, who is in charge of
Saga operations at Stanford.
Saga's area Vice President Mi
chael Bauccio last week
guaranteed Tresidder Union
Director Ellie Oppenheim "the
same high quality and attentive
service" if Saga were acquired by
Marriott, Oppenheim said.
Saga has provided food service
to Encina and the Tresidder Un
.
