# Saga takeover won't have sudden effects
## 
### MARTHA MOODY 
Although Saga Corporation —•
a major University food service
contractor — has accepted a $502
million buyout offer from Mar
riott Corporation, the takeover
probably will not affect the Stan
ford community in the short
term, according to managers of
both companies.
Any changes in management
or staff will occur only after Mar
riott managers visit "the various
operations and the people that are
running them," according to
Terry Souers, Marriott director of
corporate relations.

The takeover occurred June
10.
"Everything will stay the same
at [the Stanford] level," said
Tresidder Food Service Director
Sue Tatum, who is in charge of
Saga operations at Stanford.
Saga's area Vice President Mi
chael Bauccio last week
guaranteed Tresidder Union
Director Ellie Oppenheim "the
same high quality and attentive
service" if Saga were acquired by
Marriott, Oppenheim said.
Saga has provided food service
to Encina and the Tresidder Un
.
ion restaurants, including The Cof
fee House, The Corner Pocket,
Baker Street, The Grand Market
place and Tresidder catering.
Customers could soon see lower
prices because of the increased pur
chasing power of the combined food
service contractors, according to
Saga District Manager Paul Nelson.
Souers said he agreed that
economies of scale apply to the food
service industry, and said he hopes
the acquisition of Saga will enable
Marriott to "reap those benefits."
Immediate layoffs affecting Saga's
250 employees at the University are
unlikely, Souers said.
But there is some overlap at the
executive level, according to
analysts quoted in the Times
Tribune.
Saga's higher management staff
"will be cut because it duplicates
parts of Marriott's corporate

structure," an analyst said.
Saga Chief Executive Officer
Charles Lynch has already resigned
from his position. The acquisition
"does not provide a meaningful role
for me," he told the San Francisco
Chronicle.
The acquisition of Saga makes
Marriott the nation's largest contract
food service operation.
Although Saga's profits were
down 46 percent last quarter, Mar
riott still felt that the company was
"a good candidate for acquisition »in
part because it has an "operational
philosophy" similar to Marriott's,
Souers said, citing Saga's "belief in
quality and the value of treating
employees well."
Souers said he hopes Marriott can
reverse Saga's declining profitability.
Saga employees, both on campus
and in Menlo Park, are equally
confident that Marriott has made a
smart move in buying Saga.
Coffee House Assistant Manager
Bijan Nassirabadi said that Marriott
would not have taken Saga over if it
weren't a sound operation and that
he expects his part of that operation
to remain unchanged.

I he takeover followed over two
months of bidding by Marriott and
negotiations between top executives
of the two companies. Chairman
Willard Marriott originally ap
proached Saga in April with an un
publicized offer of $30.50 per share;
the final price accepted by Saga last
week was $39. 50 per share.
