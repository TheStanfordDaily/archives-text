# Board OKs new expansion
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
The current expansion of the Ter
man Engineering Center promises
to alleviate the building's 35,000-
square-foot shortage of classroom
space, according to James Gibbons,
dean of the School of Engineering.
The University Board of Trustees
awarded concept and site approval to
the proposed $6-$8 million expan
sion of the center and gave the the
go ahead for two other building proj
ects at its June 13 meeting. The
projects total approximately $14.5
million.
Specifically, the Terman addition
will provide case-style classrooms for
the Civil Engineering and Industrial
Engineering Departments, Gibbons
said. Case-style rooms are semi
circular classrooms built so that
every person in the room can see
one another. The two departments
have relied extensively on this type
of classroom in recent years, he said.
The board also approved con
struction of a $4.6 million, 33,663
square foot Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory just north of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center's cryogenics facility.
The laboratory, which is being
funded by the U.S. Department of
Energy, is slated for completion in
December 1987.
In addition, the trustees granted
concept and site approval for a
projected $3 million Center for the
Study of Language and Information
to be located near the intersection of
Campus Drive and Panama Street.
The center will house research on
the nature of information and how it
is transmitted through the use of
language and computation.
Gibbons called the Terman ex
pansion a "sympathetic extension."
Once the project is completed, few
people will recognize that an addi
tion has been made, he predicted.

Kathy Jordan, project manager for
the expansion, agreed that the ex
pansion would be a "pretty straight
forward operation."
"The exterior of the new wing will
match Terman's current exterior,"
Jordan said. "The [interior] expan
sion will be pretty similar to the
wing it will be adjacent to," she
added.
The expansion will extend the
west wing of the Terman Center
closer to Santa Teresa Street, Jordan
said.
In the next six months the Uni
versity will complete schematic

plans for the Terman project, Jordan
said. Upon completion "of these
schematic plans, the proposal will
be resubmitted to the trustees for
design and project approval, she
said.
To fund the Terman expansion,
Gibbons plans to solicit donations
from "sources which have specific
interests in civil engineering." He
said that it is unclear how long it will
take to generate the necessary finan
cial backing.
The earliest possible date for the
project's completion is the spring of
1988, Gibbons said.
