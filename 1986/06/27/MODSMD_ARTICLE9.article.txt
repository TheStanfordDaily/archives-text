# Florence fall victim recovering but remains comatose

### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
A Stanford student remains in a coma in
Florence, Italy, following a June 5 accident in
which she fell three stories from her apartment
balcony.
The condition of junior Kimberly
Thompson has improved since the first few
days after the accident, and she is expected to
be moved out of intensive care "within the
near future," according to Nancy Padgett,
deputy director of the Overseas Studies Office
at Stanford.
Thompson, an international relations
major, was attending classes at Stanford's
campus in Florence at the time of the acci
dent.
According to Padgett, comas are measured
on a scale from zero to 10, with zero as a
waking state and 10 as the deepest comatose
state. Originally in a coma considered a "six,"
Thompson has improved to a "three" coma

since the accident's initial trauma, Padgett
said.
According to the Stanford University News
Service, Thompson was hosting a quiet end
of-the-quarter party in her rented apartment
on the night of the accident. At about 1:30
a.m., she and about 10 other students decided
to see who could spit the furthest from the bal
cony. Leaning over a very low railing,
Thompson lost her balance and fell, despite
the efforts of a student standing next to her to
prevent her fall.
Thompson suffered severe head trauma and
internal injuries and has remained in a coma
since the accident, according to reports given
University doctors by her Italian physicians.
According to Padgett, Dr. John Dorman at
Cowell Student Health Center is monitoring
regular reports from the Italian physicians
caring for Thompson. Dorman was un
available for comment.
Thompson's parents, Nancy and Jerry

Thompson of Long Beach, flew to Florence
immediately following the accident and have
remained there since, Padgett said.
Thompson's brother, a high school student, is
expected to join the family soon.
Thompson's mother said that she and her
parents are allowed to visit Thompson "a
couple of times a day for about five or 10
minutes" in a two-bed intensive-care unit.
Since the accident, Thompson developed a
lung infection and was on a respirator until the
condition cleared up, Padgett said. She added
that "the acute phase of the trauma is over."
"We're very pleased with Kimberly's prog
ress," Thompson's mother said. "She gets
physically stronger every day. She just keeps
moving forward.
"We're very impressed with the medical
team here. They've brought in specialists who
are monitoring her very closely," she said.
"Kimberly's receiving identical care to what
she'd be getting at Stanford's Medical Center,"
she added.

Doctors began therapy for the coma "very
quickly" after the accident, using "stimulation
to the brain through pictures and sound,"
Padgett said.
Friends of Thompson can aid in the therapy
by sending tape-recordings for Thompson's
walkman. Thompson listens to the walkman
for about six hours each day, according to
Padgett.
Thompson's mother said the tapes should
be of familiar voices speaking to her in En
glish.
"She seems to respond best to happy, up
beat and loud voices," Thompson said.
Tapes should be given to the Overseas
Studies Office here, and the office will send
them on to Florence, according to Padgett.
Padgett also said cards and letters will be
helpful to Thompson's parents, since the acci
dent has been "very difficult for [them]."
"Kimberly is going to recover," Thompson's
mother said. "She will be back at Stanford,
maybe not fall quarter, but she will be back."
