# Oil leakage linked to Varian

The "oily sheen" that appeared on the surface of Palo
Alto's Matadero Creek and contaminated part of the
Stanford Industrial Park last week has been traced to a
pipe belonging to Varian Associates, according to a
company spokesperson.
Gary Simpson, vice president of Corporate Commu
nications at Varian, said yesterday the sheen was caused
by an "intermittent leak in a pipe leading to a tank that
holds high purity mineral oil.
"(The mineral oil) serves as a coolant in large tanks,"
he added.
Varian is a tenant at Stanford Industrial Park.
Lee Thompson, associate staff counsel for the Uni
versity, said yesterday he was unsure whether Stanford
could be held liable for the leak. The leak was stopped
late Thursday afternoon.
The oil at Varian, however, does not contain any
trichlorethylene (TCE) or trichlorethane (TCA), two
toxic substances found in the water samples analyzed
from the creek, Simpson said. Neither Simpson nor
Palo Alto Fire Chief Robert Wall could speculate the
source of these chemicals.
The levels of the two toxics were far below the five

parts per billion of TCE and 200 parts per billion of
TCA deemed a health hazard by the Santa Clara Water
District.
Further lab results will be completed over the next
two weeks by both Palo Alto and the Bay Area Regional
Water Quality Board. Only then can further specula
tions be made, Wall said.
Last week Wall said the material found is similar to
the chemicals that leaked from an underground tank in
the research park earlier this year.
Matadero Creek is not a source of drinking water, al
though neighborhood residents in Palo Alto are con
cerned about possible long-term effects on children and
animals that play in the creek, according to the San Jose
Mercury News.
Simpson said last week "a small trickle was traced" to
the Varian building. The slow leak was caused by "a
loose connection" between the pipes and a tank which
held the coolant, he said.
The mineral oil found its way first to a floor drain
near the tank and then to the storm drain through which
it entered the creek, he said. The drain has now been
plugged.
He added that the source was difficult to locate be-

A wall of sandbags dams the Matadero Creek west of the El Camino Real, preventing leaking oil from seeping
into San Francisco Bay. The contaminant was traced to Varian Associates in Stanford Research Park.
