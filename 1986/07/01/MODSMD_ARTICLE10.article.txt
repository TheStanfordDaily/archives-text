# Gay rights groups vow to battle Supreme Court sodomy ruling
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO — Angry gay rights advocates
across California yesterday vowed to take to the streets to
fight a Supreme Court ruling that upheld a Georgia law
making sodomy a crime.
"The fight is not over, it has just begun," declared
Roberta Achtenberg, an attorney for the Lesbian Rights
Foundation here. "It will continue in the state courts, in
the state legislatures and in the streets until these homo
phobic laws fall."
The 5-4 decision yesterday also ruled that consenting
adults have no constitutional right to private
homosexual conduct. Achtenberg said 25 states and the
District of Columbia have similar sodomy laws.
Although California's sodomy law was repealed in
1975 with the Consenting Adult Law, officials from
several homosexual rights groups expressed outrage and
concern at the Supreme Court's decision.
"Any one of us who crosses the state lines runs the risk
of facing prosecution," Achtenberg said, adding that

' heterosexuals may also be harassed. "All of us need to be
concerned because others in other states are not free."
The ruling reversed an earlier federal appeals court
ruling that said the Georgia law infringes on a
"fundamental" constitutional right. The law defines
sodomy as "any sexual act involving the sex organs of
one person and the mouth or anus of another."
The Georgia law also makes certain heterosexual acts
a crime even if performed by a married couple.
However, there is no record of Georgia enforcing the
law against heterosexuals, and today's decision did not
address that issue.
"This decision is an outrageous violation of personal
dignity. It says people don't have a right to do what they
want in their own bedroom, whether they are two men,
a man and a woman, or two women," said Eric Rofers,
executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Center in
West Hollywood.
