# High court decision fuels state's equal vote controversy

SAN FRANCISCO â€” Yesterday's U.S. Supreme
Court ruling on gerrymandering lets California
Republicans revive their challenge to the state's 1982
congressional reapportionment, but a lawyer for the
Democrats predicted the challenge would lose.
"The good news for Republicans is that courts will
look at [gerrymandering]," said Joseph Remcho, who
represents California Democrats in the long-standing
suit. "The bad news for Republicans in California is that
they're going to take a hard look at it."
Referring to James Parrinello, the Republicans'
lawyer in the case, Remcho said, "Although Mr. Par
rinello is certainly going to get his day in court, I don't
think it's going to be a happy ending."
However, Parrinello called yesterday's ruling a
"major victory" and said the Supreme Court's new
standards appear to open the way for Republicans to get
the California congressional reapportionment thrown
out by 1988.
If the suit succeeds, the legislature would be asked to
design new congressional districts for the 1988 and 1990
elections, after which a new reapportionment would be
needed according to the 1990 census. A new reappor

tionment plan would also need the governor's approval.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an Indiana case
that the state's Democrats, who had challenged a
legislative redistricting plan pushed through by majority
Republicans, had failed to prove a constitutional viola
tion.
But six of the nine justices said the court could over
turn gerrymandering in other cases if the rights of a poli
tical group had been systematically violated. In the past,
court reviews of reapportionment plans have been
confined to the questions of whether the districts had
equal numbers of voters and whether the voting strength
of a racial or ethnic minority was lessened.
In the California case, Parrinello said, the Demo
crats' major argument has been that courts cannot
review political gerrymandering. "Now that that argu
ment has been . . . rejected, I think we're in a very
strong position," Parrinello said.
Democrats have a 28-17 majority in the state's con
gressional delegation. The reapportionment plan was
drafted by the late Rep. Phil Burton of San Francisco,
approved by the Democratic-controlled legislature and
signed by Democratic Gov. Edmund Brown, Jr.
