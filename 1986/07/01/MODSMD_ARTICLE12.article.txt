OPEC meet fails to set price strategy
BRIONI, Yugoslavia — OPEC's attempt to devise a plan for ending
the world oil slump broke up in failure again yesterday, and analysts
said they expected prices to fell slightly.
Despite six days of discussions on this balmy Adriatic island, the
cartel leaders headed home with no firm agreements on the key issue
of how to lower production enough to prop up prices. Oil ministers,
who have met without success on three occasions in four months,
said they would meet again July 28.
"Really, OPEC has run amok," said Scott Jones, an energy analyst
at the private consulting firm Chase Econometrics Inc. in Bala Cyn
wyd, Pa. "Production is out of control."
Jones predicted crude oil prices would slip $1 to $2 a barrel, with
retail gasoline prices in the United States dropping as much as a nickel
a gallon by August.
Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst who was observing the talks for the
Paine Webber investment firm, also said he expected oil prices to fall
as a result of OPEC's stalemate, "but probably not a lot."
World oil prices currently are in a range of $11 to $14 a barrel, de
pressed by the oil glut and OPEC's inability to agree on a strategy for
ending it.
Syria pledges to help free hostages
DAMASCUS, Syria — President Hafez Assad promised U.S. Rep.
Robert Dornan yesterday that Syria will continue its efforts to free
American hostages in Lebanon, Syria's official news agency SANA re
ported.
SANA quoted Assad as telling Dornan that Syria has tried to secure
the hostages' release for humanitarian reasons, regardless of Syria's re
lations with the U.S. government.
Dornan, a California Republican, handed Assad a letter signed by
247 members of Congress urging Assad to help in gaining the release
of five Americans believed held by Shiite Moslem groups in Lebanon.
SANA said the petition thanked Assad for his role in securing the
freedom of passengers who were aboard a hijacked TWA airliner last
year, and the 1983 release of David Dodge, the kidnapped acting pres
ident of the American University' of Beirut.
The five hostages are Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspon
dent of The Associated Press; the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, head of the
Catholic Relief Service in Beirut; William Buckley, political officer at
the U.S. Embassy in Beirut; David Jacobsen, administrator at the
American University Hospital, and Thomas Sutherland, dean of
Agriculture at the American University of Beirut.
Dornan said Sunday after meeting Foreign Minister Farouk al-
Sharaa that Syria "will display all its efforts to ensure the release of our
citizens unharmed."
