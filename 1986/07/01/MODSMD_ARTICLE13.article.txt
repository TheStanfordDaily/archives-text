Raiders to stay in LA
OAKLAND — Oakland's last hope for forcing the
Los Angeles Raiders football team to return was
dashed yesterday when the U.S. Supreme Court
barred the city from claiming ownership of the team
under the principle of eminent domain.
The ruling, said attorney David Self, who headed
the city's four-year battle to get the National Football
League team back, "means that the eminent domain
action is over."
The Supreme Court barred the city from claiming
ownership of the team, which moved to Los Angeles
in 1982. The court previously had rejected the NFL's
challenge to the move.
Last November, a state appeals court rejected the
eminent domain theory, saying that if the city was
successful it would be interfering with interstate com
merce.
The California Supreme Court refused in
February to hear the eminent domain argument.
Eminent domain is the procedure by which political

bodies condemn private property and acquire it for
the public good.
Police probe Rogers death
SACRAMENTO — Football star Don Rogers was
killed by a fatal dose of cocaine, a toxicologist said
yesterday, and police opened a criminal investigation
of his death.
Rogers, 23, a defensive back with the Cleveland
Browns of the National Football League, died
Friday.
Coroner Charles Simmons ruled the cause of
death was "cocaine poisioning," and he called it ac
cidental, with no other drugs involved.
The autopsy could not determine whether Rogers
was a regular user of cocaine.
Police began a criminal investigation by interview
ing Rogers' relatives and friends and may pursue
charges of manslaughter or furnishing drugs to
Rogers, Asst. Police Chief Jerry Finney said.
