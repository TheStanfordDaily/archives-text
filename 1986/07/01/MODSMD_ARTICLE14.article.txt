## The

Needless cruelty to AIDS victims is the upshot of the Justice De
partment's panicky opinion on AIDS issued two weeks ago.
Signed by Charles J. Cooper, head of the Justice Department's Of
fice of Legal Council, the decision is based on scientific error. It di
rectly contradicts the results of several government studies on the
spread of the disease.
The opinion permits employers and public health officials who
believe they are preventing the spread of the disease to discriminate
against people infected with it. This actually contributes to the spread
of the fatal disease by discouraging those in high risk groups to take the
AIDS antibody test.
Poor sense suffuses this decision.
Government researchers have stated repeatedly that AIDS is spread
through the transfer of blood and semen, and not through casual con
tact. The Justice Department opinion, however, states that "the risk of
medical uncertainty must be borne'' by the person alleging discrimi
nation.
The decision tosses weighty legal burdens on the shoulders of suffer
ing victims. They must prove that the risk they pose to the health of
others "can be calculated with a high degree of medical certainty and
is low enough" to be safely overlooked.
The opinion plays on the outright fear of the public against the fatal
disease, a fear that will only grow as the disease spreads, afflicting
heterosexuals, intraveneous drug users and children. Today more
than 20,000 cases of AIDS and 12,000 deaths from the disease have
been recorded by government agencies. The Public Health Service es
timates that 1. 5 million people have been infected by the AIDS virus,
and that 20 to 30 percent of these will contract the disease by 1991.
We all fear AIDS. No one wants to stop public health officials from
battling the spread of the disease. But the Justice Department has mis
read and twisted scientific evidence about how the disease is con
tracted, thus creating a powerful disincentive for people in high risk
groups to test for AIDS â€” since positive results could mean lost jobs.
This unjustified opinion interferes with testing, one effective way to
monitor spread of AIDS.
Not much could be worse. But much could be better.
This spring Stanford adopted a hiring policy guaranteeing privacy
for faculty, staff and students seeking employment here. Believed to be
the first of its kind at a U.S. university, the statement protects appli
cants diagnosed with AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC) or supected
of being in a high-risk category.
In sharp contrast to the Justice Department opinion, the Stanford
policy is marked by good sense and compassion.
Fortunately, courts which consider the Justice Department's
opinion unjust have the power to supercede it.
We emphatically hope they will do so. We hope they follow Stan
ford's lead.
