# Borges' magic will be missed
## 
### 
Jorge Luis Borges, famed Argentine writer and poet,
died about two weeks ago at the age of 86. I had never
read one word of him before taking Prof. Nancy Packer's
wonderful "Development of the Short Story" course; I
have since explored his writings enough to want to write
my first Daily column about Borges. So here goes.
His stories (his best ones) are magic. Not really fiction
or essays, but somewhere in between. Often he borders
on science fiction or fantasy. Almost always his charac
ters (if there are any at all; often there is only Borges
himself, thinly disguised as a first-person narrator) play a
subordinate role to his ideas and philosophical explora
tions.

Such explorations, impossibly condensed while im
possibly encompassing, reveal the author's vast knowl
edge of every form of literature, in every time period.
Many of Borges' stories (he never wrote any longer
works), in fact, concern themselves with the
synchronicity of all literature, and its direct correlation
to history and reality.
In his story "The Theologians," he describes how in
ancient times two rival holy men tried to outdo one an
other in determining whether history is circular.
One theologian tries to support the idea intellectu
ally, exhaustively searching through his library and fin
ding that Plutarch attacked the notion of an infinite
cycle of worlds, Augustine believed in salvation from a
circular labyrinth, Prometheus' ravaged liver eternally
regenerated itself, etc. . . .
His rival scholar refutes the idea, quoting from the
Bible the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews
that Jesus was not sacrificed many times, but once; he
also cites the "vain repetitions of the pagans" of Matthew
6:7.

By this time Borges has also described how Huns
ravaged the first theologian's library, explained the psy
chological nature of his rivalry, and the religious impor
tance of refuting the circular nature of time.
This all occurs, incidentally, by page three.
That is why Borges never wrote a novel — he had no
need to do so. And from the standpoint of reading en
joyment I hasten to add that "The Theologians" is
(unlike a mere synopsis) absolutely fascinating, not dry
and over-scholarly, for Borges was a great writer as well
as a great reader.
And his ideas! One tale of a man who wishes to write
"Don Quixote" (not rewrite it, but write it); a story of a
lunatic who claims that a corner of his basement will
reveal the secrets to all things (but is telling the
truth). . . these are novels in 15 or 20 pages. In a one
page essay entitled "Everything and Nothing," Borges
speculates that Shakespeare's need to create stemmed
from a desperate internal emptiness, describing his lon
ging in so moving and profound a fashion that an En
glish professor to whom I showed the piece plans to
teach it during his summer Shakespeare seminar here.
I find it revitalizing to lose myself in the world of
Borges, where (to my delight) all the things I read and
absorbed as an English major do count for more than
cocktail party conversation. A Borges story is as much a
celebration of the literature of others as it is a work on
his own terms.
The human mind is, for him, both "Everything and
Nothing" — infinite in its capacity to absorb, create and
imagine, yet tiny and insignificant in its role as one link
in a universal chain of great heroes and villains, great
thinkers, and great literature.
And I think rt is wonderful to discover that, in some
small way, Borges in his death has acted out a part of the
mysterious, surreal magic within all his writings: He
died earlier this month, in Geneva. And in a poem pub
lished in the June 2 issue of New Yorker magazine,
Borges wrote:
"Which of my cities/ am I doomed to die in?/
Geneva, where revelation reached me/ from Virgil and
Tacitus . . . ?"
