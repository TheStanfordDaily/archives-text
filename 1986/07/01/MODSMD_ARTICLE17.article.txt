# VIEWPOINT
## The
						Lady is not 'a lady' for all 
### 
As the country rushes toward a commercialized salute
to "The Lady," I must admit that I have never had
much affection for her, and I have never had the feeling
that she was carrying a torch for me. Not that I couldn't
develop an affection for The Lady; but I am not sure the
Moral Majority (?) would want me, an Afro-American,
to "have a thing going on" with her.

Actually, as I look at pictures of her, she symbolizes
all of the expressions I grew up hearing that were code
words or laws for racism: "White is right;" restrictive
covenants; poll taxes; states' rights; "separate but equal;"
seniority rule; and the list goes on.
As I grew older, they became more eloquent, but just
as lethal: "with deliberate speed;" "trickle down"
theories and "safety nets;" "pro-life" (for whites), but
"pro-capital punishment" (for blacks); "urban renewal"
and "gentrification;" "color-blind" Constitution and
policies; "constructive engagement" and "quiet
diplomacy" (on arbitrary bases); no "goals and quotas"
(except in the military draft); and "reverse discrimina
tion."

Clever propagandists often put their concepts to song.
I visualized these concepts in my youth when I heard
"This is My Country," "This is My Land," "Dixie" and
"Battle Hymn of the Republic." And today I get that
same kind of discomfort when I hear songs such as
"Born in the USA." I don't get the feeling that the
lyricists had me (or native Mexican-Americans) in mind
when they wrote these songs and might resent my sing
ing them.
So, I kind of hum along: "This is your country, land
of your birth. ..."
By now, I suspect a few readers are saying: "If he
doesn't like it, leave!" I have a better idea: I believe those
readers who say this would feel more at home in South
Africa. I should warn them, however, that they may be
going first class on the Titanic, because apartheid will
surely sink.
No, I don't have much affection for The Lady, or El
lis Island. My parents didn't enter the country that way,
they were not invited, were forced in through the back
door. Therefore, I'm surprised Afro-Americans haven't
been declared illegal aliens.
Happy Birthday, Ma'am.
