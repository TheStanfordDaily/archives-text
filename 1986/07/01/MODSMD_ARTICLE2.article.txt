# Med School receives AIDS research grant
## Stanford awarded $8 million for study 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Stanford Medical School has
been selected one of 14 research in
stitutions nationwide that will take
part in a $100 million project to find
a cure for AIDS, a federal official
announced yesterday in Washing
ton, D.C.
The five-year study, which will
concentrate on testing drugs that
have shown potential to counteract
the AIDS virus, could enroll as
many as 1,000 AIDS victims, ac
cording to Dr. Anthony Fauci,
director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID).
Dr. William Robinson, a profes
sor of infectious diseases at the
Medical School, has called the proj
ect amount the largest grant ever for
infectious disease research.
The NIAID funding should give
the medical community an opportu
nity "to pursue a focused part of
AIDS research and to get really good
answers" about promising drugs,
said Robinson, who will work with a
team of Stanford doctors on the
project.
Researchers expect Stanford's
$8.1 million part of the study will
test one or two drugs and involve
about 50 AIDS victims in the first
year. The patients are expected to be
treated in an experimental ward at
Stanford Hospital, at an AIDS clinic
to be established at the Stanford
Clinic and at the Kaiser-Permanente
Medical Center in San Francisco,
according to Dr. Thomas Merigan,
professor of infectious diseases and
principal project investigator at
Stanford.
Acquired immune deficiency

syndrome, a deadly disease which
destroys the immune system and
leaves victims vulnerable to infec
tion and certain types of cancer, af
fects about 22,000 Americans and
will have killed about 18,000 by the
end of the year, according to federal
estimates. Currently, there is no
cure for the disease.
"I am very enthusiastic about this
effort," Merigan said. "These five
years are going to be a critical time
in which science can help bring this
disease under control."
However, Merigan and Robinson
caution that the study is just a begin
ning and does not promise a cure.
T he study is specifically designed
to allow quick and efficient evalua
tion of drugs and will not focus on
prevention or basic research, ac
cording to Robinson. By establish
ing AIDS centers around the
country, there will always be
patients available for immediate test
ing, he explained.
"The study is organized in a way
that streamlines and facilitates work
in drug evaluation," said Robinson,
who has done major research
on the hepatitis-B virus and other
viruses similar to AIDS .
Representatives of the 14 AIDS
Treatment Evaluation Units will
meet July 17 and 18 in Bethesda,
Md. to discuss which institutions
will test which drugs and will meet
regularly thereafter to discuss
results, Robinson said.
"By tying together clinical re
search groups with a commitment to
exchange information, it should be
a strong step forward in trying to un
derstand this illness, said Dr.
George Matula, consultant in infec-
tious disease at Kaiser-Permanente
Medical Center.
Drugs likely to be tested in the
first year of the study include ribavirin, azidot
hymidine, interferon alpha, foscarnet and
HPA-23, NIAID officials said.
These drugs work either by inhibiting a vital

enzyme that the AIDS virus uses to reproduce
itself or by stimulating the immune system,
according to Merigan. Nine of the centers —
not including Stanford — will also test drugs
to control infections and cancers that develop
in AIDS victims, he said.
Initial studies will determine safe dosages
and side effects, and latei studies will assess
long-term effects in controlled studies of

patients with AIDS and AIDS-related com
plex, a less severe condition caused by the
same virus.
Robinson said the Stanford project is cur
rently looking for study participants and en
couraged anyone who has been diagnosed
positively for AIDS to contact the University
Department of Infectious Diseases.
Other institutions selected as AIDS Treat

ment Evaluation Units are: San Francisco
General Hospital, UCLA, UC-San Diego,
University of Washington, University of Texas
at Houston, University of Miami School of
Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, University
of Pittsburgh, New York University, Memorial
Hospital for Cancer and Allied Disease in
New York, University of Rochester Medical
Center and Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston.

cure for the disease.
"I am very enthusiastic about this
effort," Merigan said. "These five
years are going to be a critical time
in which science can help bring this
disease under control."
However, Merigan and Robinson
caution that the study is just a begin
ning and does not promise a cure.
T he study is specifically designed
to allow quick and efficient evalua
tion of drugs and will not focus on
prevention or basic research, ac
cording to Robinson. By establish
ing AIDS centers around the
country, there will always be
patients available for immediate test
ing, he explained.
"The study is organized in a way
that streamlines and facilitates work
in drug evaluation," said Robinson,
who has done major research
on the hepatitis-B virus and other
viruses similar to AIDS .
Representatives of the 14 AIDS
Treatment Evaluation Units will
meet July 17 and 18 in Bethesda,
Md. to discuss which institutions
will test which drugs and will meet
regularly thereafter to discuss
results, Robinson said.
"By tying together clinical re
search groups with a commitment to
exchange information, it should be
a strong step forward in trying to un
derstand this illness, said Dr.
George Matula, consultant in infec-
tious disease at Kaiser-Permanente
Medical Center.
Drugs likely to be tested in the
first year of the study include ribavirin, azidot
hymidine, interferon alpha, foscarnet and
HPA-23, NIAID officials said.
These drugs work either by inhibiting a vital

enzyme that the AIDS virus uses to reproduce
itself or by stimulating the immune system,
according to Merigan. Nine of the centers —
not including Stanford — will also test drugs
to control infections and cancers that develop
in AIDS victims, he said.
Initial studies will determine safe dosages
and side effects, and latei studies will assess
long-term effects in controlled studies of

patients with AIDS and AIDS-related com
plex, a less severe condition caused by the
same virus.
Robinson said the Stanford project is cur
rently looking for study participants and en
couraged anyone who has been diagnosed
positively for AIDS to contact the University
Department of Infectious Diseases.
Other institutions selected as AIDS Treat

ment Evaluation Units are: San Francisco
General Hospital, UCLA, UC-San Diego,
University of Washington, University of Texas
at Houston, University of Miami School of
Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital, University
of Pittsburgh, New York University, Memorial
Hospital for Cancer and Allied Disease in
New York, University of Rochester Medical
Center and Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston.
