DEAR BUG ME: I admire you guys to no end.
How do you answer those great questions?
— Awestruck
DEAR AWE: Thank you for your support. Fact is,
we can't continue our crusade against the unknown if
we don't receive questions soon! Please jot down
whatever is bugging you and drop it off at The Daily
offices. Thank you for your and keep those
cards and letters coming.
DEAR BUG ME: Why do Swatches tigk so loudly?
— Punctually Ticked Off
DEAR TICKED: The exact history of Swatch
watches has been clouded and confused, both by
rumors created by the marketing representatives for
the product and by company cover-ups perpetrated
by the official offices in New York.
Two interesting stories stem from marketing repre
sentatives on the West Coast. The first, originally
coming from a regional marketing representative and
relayed to us by a saleswoman at the Nordstrom store
at Stanford Shopping Center, claims that Swatches
were introduced without any tick at all. Because
Swatch received so many inquiries about this too
silent watch, they decided to add the noise. This tick
ing noise, which remains today, was designed to
satisfy the Swatch wearer's expectations that a watch
should tick.
The second story, coming from Renee in the Los
Angeles offices, claims that the tick in Swatches has
been preserved in order to protect against counterfeit
Swatches. Assuming that all Swatches tick alike, and
that the tick would be difficult to reproduce, you
would know if you had the real thing just by listening
for the familiar tick.
Although the sources of these stories swear that
their explanations for the tick-mystery are true, word
from company headquarters claims otherwise. We
spoke to Office Manager Terry Ross, who, when
asked about the ticking, said, "I havs 10 of them at
home. When I put them on a hard surface at night,
they sound like the infernal tick. ... You have to
put them under a shag rug to keep them quiet."
More seriously, Ross explained that Swatch has
"done some investigation" into "remedying" the tick.
"(But) we don't consider the ticking a significant
enough problem to stand in the way of someone en
joying the product," he said.
Ross explained that the watches are all made by
robots and that to reduce the noise made by the
movement would require adding a sophisticated
sound baffle. Adding this new step in the robotics
line would require a massive redesign of the already
successful product — a change that just wouldn't be
worth it for Swatch.
When asked about the rumor that the tick helps
guard against counterfeits, Ross agreed that the tick is
a characteristic trait of the watch, but added that the
decision to keep the tick was not based on this anti
counterfeit motive. Furthermore, Ross wholeheart

edly discounted the first story. "That sounds idiotic!"
he said.
You may choose for yourself which story to
believe.
DEAR BUG ME: My roommate loves Corona Ex
tra beer but I think it tastes like water. Should I tell
her?
- Adolph Coors
DEAR ADOLPH: From the question as stated, we
assume that you are really bugged because your
roommate loves this beer for some reason other than
beer flavor. You are troubled by the possibility that
she is drinking a beer because of its popularity rather
than its intrinsic merits. Though telling her that it

tastes like water may open her eyes to the fact that she
is drinking a weakly-flavored beer, it may also create
a rift in your roommate relationship due to your
criticism of her trendy, misplaced ideals.
After laborious research in the Bug Me lab, we
have concluded that your differing beer opinions may
not be entirely incompatible. By asking ourselves
why Corona has become so incredibly popular, we
have stumbled upon the conjecture that the beer's
popularity is due largely to the fact that it does taste
like water. Darn good water at that.
To come to grips with this paradox of popularity,
you must realize that many people do not enjoy real
beer flavor. Corona has succeeded by offering a
premium beer with a smoother, milder, less offensive
flavor that appeals to a broader range of partiers, espe
cially to those who don't particularly like beer. The
combination of this mild (watery) flavor with popular
promoters (we thought Jimmy Buffet drank
margaritas) has guaranteed Corona's popularity.
To answer whether you should tell your roomie
how you feel, we suggest that you continue drinking
your hearty brew while allowing her to drink a beer
that won't make her cringe every time she takes a sip.
