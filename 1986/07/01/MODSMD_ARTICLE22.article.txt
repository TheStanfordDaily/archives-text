# Campus changes in summer off-season
## 
### MIMI GASICH 
Student campus lovers boast
about the sprawling recreational
facilities on the Farm, calling it a
$16,000-a-year country club. The
golf course, tennis courts, pools and
lake are open free or with minimal
charge year-round to Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff.
During the summer, however,
most students leave campus to take
on jobs elsewhere. And students
who stay here say campus is quiet.
But with some 14,000 visitors for
summer camps and conferences, as
well as thousands of others who pass
through daily, campus is far from
boring.
Campus definitely takes on a dif
ferent character during the summer
months. Denis Phillips, who likes to
walk his dog in the evenings, says
that campus is "creepy" around
midnight because it is so empty.
During the regular school year
"people are everywhere," he says.
Phillips and his wife Valerie arc
resident fellows at Twain House in
Stern Hall. When students moved
out of Stern and other dorms after
final exams three weeks ago, janitors
entered and "erased all sign of the
students in one day," Denis Phillips
says.
This summer Stanford is hosting
Australian tennis players, Christian
Science officials, international
mineralogists, Slavic language stu
dents, high school cheerleaders and
corporate executives, just to name a
few groups.
Now, at least in one way, campus
is safer, Valerie Phillips says. For
the first time in months she no
longer fears "getting run over by a
bike," she says.
Students feel a difference too.
Many who stay here year-round say
there's nothing to do on campus
during the summer. Sophomores
Allen Blue and Lloyd Mayer have
summer jobs on campus but are
primarily here to plan Gaieties, a
Big Game Week musical comedy
written, produced and performed by
students. Blue and Mayer spend
some afternoons chatting in Blue's
Wilbur Hall dorm room, with their
door open to visitors. Campus is a
lot quieter during the summer, they
say, and they are often bored by the
lack of activities.

"The biggest difference during the
summer is the scarcity of Stanford
undergrads," Allen says. "Wilbur is
the only kind of dorm atmosphere
left on campus. And the frats are
closed so there are no big organized
parties."
Some students, however, like the
quiet atmosphere here during the
summer. "It's nice to wander
around alone while the campus is so
quiet," says Lynda Stone, a graduate
student, adding "even during the
regular school year there really is no
social life for graduate students."
But classes only started last week,
and some visiting students expect
things to start happening on campus
soon. "We're just getting to know
each other now [and] it's been pretty
fun," says summer school attendee
Lilian Ting, a high school student
from the Philippines. "People will
probably get tired of small, informal
parties after a while, so I think big
parties will get started soon," she
says.
Parties or no parties, some high
school football players are making
their own fun here. "We have about
seven hours of practice every day,"
says Del Gunter of San Jose. "At
night we watch football movies and
then we are supposed to be in bed by
11 p.m. But our floor is pretty rowdy
and we played soccer, hockey, bas
ketball and football in the halls the
other night."
Stanford police say that even with
new events and new visitors on
campus, they face the same prob
lems as they do throughout the year.
An employee in the records depart
ment says the officers are as busy
now as they always are, answering
calls ranging from parking tickets to
burglaries. The police department is
busiest betwen September and No
vember, when the school year starts
up again each year, she adds.
One of the few organized events
on campus which has already begun
is the summer housing film series,
which will run through August 13.
Films, including "Blazing Saddles"
and"The World According to
Garp," are shown outdoors at the
"Wilbur Field Drive-In" lawn each
Wednesday night.
Students also go off campus to
find entertainment.

Some students, however, like the
quiet atmosphere here during the
summer. "It's nice to wander
around alone while the campus is so
quiet," says Lynda Stone, a graduate
student, adding "even during the
regular school year there really is no
social life for graduate students."
But classes only started last week,
and some visiting students expect
things to start happening on campus
soon. "We're just getting to know
each other now [and] it's been pretty
fun," says summer school attendee
Lilian Ting, a high school student
from the Philippines. "People will
probably get tired of small, informal
parties after a while, so I think big
parties will get started soon," she
says.
Parties or no parties, some high
school football players are making
their own fun here. "We have about
seven hours of practice every day,"
says Del Gunter of San Jose. "At
night we watch football movies and
then we are supposed to be in bed by
11 p.m. But our floor is pretty rowdy
and we played soccer, hockey, bas
ketball and football in the halls the
other night."
Stanford police say that even with
new events and new visitors on
campus, they face the same prob
lems as they do throughout the year.
An employee in the records depart
ment says the officers are as busy
now as they always are, answering
calls ranging from parking tickets to
burglaries. The police department is
busiest betwen September and No
vember, when the school year starts
up again each year, she adds.
One of the few organized events
on campus which has already begun
is the summer housing film series,
which will run through August 13.
Films, including "Blazing Saddles"
and"The World According to
Garp," are shown outdoors at the
"Wilbur Field Drive-In" lawn each
Wednesday night.
Students also go off campus to
find entertainment.
