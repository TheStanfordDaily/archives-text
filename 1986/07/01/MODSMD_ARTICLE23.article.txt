## One Step Beyond hits that perfect beat 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Picture this: It is Saturday at midnight, and
you have just contracted a feverish case of in
fluenza de fiesta, or what is more commonly
called, the party bug — that unrelenting drive
to satiate the hedonist inside you.
Because treatment of this sweet sickness is
impossible, you need to find somewhere close
— say within 30 minutes of campus, without
speeding. Knowing also that you are not easily
satisfied, this place must remain open until
you collapse from dance-induced exhaustion
— say 6 a.m. on weekends.

Combine all of this with crowd, decor and
music that are nothing short of unique, and
you have the One Step Beyond — a nightclub
in Santa Clara.
In fact, I can remember several months ago
when I first visited One Step Beyond being
surprised to find a club so far from San Fran
cisco pumping progressive, but not obscure,
dance music.
Many of the "underground" clubs in San
Francisco, trying to avoid mainstream music
and the crowd that such melodies attract, run
to the other extreme, becoming too obscure to
be truly enjoyable. The crowds at these places
seem to be more concerned with not bumping
into "mainstream people" than with any spe

cific movement — musical, societal or other
wise.
Such is not the case at One Step Beyond.
Surely there are some people who believe
they are too hip to be there, just as there are
others that gave up trying to be "in the scene"
a long time ago and now are simply looking for
a good time, no strings attached.
However, the majority of the crowd is a fun
loving, somewhat trendy and self-centered
crew. Some dance quite well, or so they think,
and opt to mix it up on the platforms in the
center of either dance floor, while others are
content with a less limelit existence and dance
among the masses. Very few do not dance.
It is not the standard club scene where
hordes of supercilious women live to be ac
costed by men with mammoth egos wearing
overly-tight trousers and shirts buttoned so in
completely as if to say, "Check out the growth
on my bulging pecs. I am a real, post
pubescent man!" Thank the Lord for small
favors.
So fear not ladies, for in the words of a One
Step regular asked to be identified only as
D.L.T., "The reason I go there is because it's
not the standard club scene where guys come
up to you and ask you to go home with them
an hour later!"
Even if you just go to One Step Beyond to
witness the scene and do not actively partici
pate, you will still be getting more than your
four dollar's worth.
The wall surfaces could easily stand alone as
a contemporary art exhibit that changes more
often than Boy George does his/her mascara.
In fact, the work of Chris Elliman, art director
at One Step Beyond, handily secures my vote

for the most creative wall design of any Bay
Area club I have experienced thus far.
But like most things in life, it is the people
that make the difference. There is innate
beauty in a person responding to music as he
or she feels it. Their choreography may be
sloppy. They may even be four beats behind
the song, but they are beautiful, nonetheless,

simply by virtue of their mood. The emphasis
is on fun. People are reacting to the music and
like The Tom Tom Club puts it, "Who needs
to think when your feet just go?"
"We're here to entertain. If we can expose
people to something new while they're having


a good time, then fine, says One
Step Beyond's owner Stan Kent.
"A lot of progressive clubs have a
tendency to almost look down on an
artist that's doing well or a song
that's become a hit because it's no
longer unique,'' he adds, advising
Bay Area club owners to stop target
ing certain crowds and instead to
turn their sights to the challenge of
creating "an atmosphere of fun and
excitement for everybody" as he says
he has sought.
Providing enjoyment is clearly
Kent's supreme concern. From his
promises to keep playing music until
the last dancers have lost their kick
to the frequent special events he
sponsors, his purpose is as simple as
a smile.
Some of the upcoming concert
events to be featured at One Step
Beyond include: Cherry Bombz
with Jet Boy, Big Bang Beat
and the Wooden Tops.
