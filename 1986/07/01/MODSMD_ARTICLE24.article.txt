"Where Angels Fear to Tread"
By E.M. Forster
Vintage Books, $3.95
It is a delight to be in E.M. Forster's world. It is a
world of aesthetics and literature, of music, of
countryside, of architecture and of beauty. It has
romance about it. And because it is a world of British

BOOKS

pretension, it is also one of wit. In his first two novels,
"Where Angels Fear to Tread" (1905) and "A Room
With a View" (1908), he splits this world into two grand
sets, England and Italy.
The novels are not so much stories of the English or
of the Italians, but of the English in Italy, of the cool
Northern reserve when it meets its fiery Southern, or
Latin, counterpart. The latter book has been garnering
much attention lately, having been made into a splashy

movie and reprinted in editions sporting a colorful cover
photo. But his first published novel (Forster apparently
began "A Room With a View" in 1903, but finished it
after the publication of "Where Angels Fear to Tread")
is one that is not widely circulated today.
That is a shame, for it is a novel that is not only strik
ing for a first-time storyteller, but also one which has the
intelligence of a seasoned and consummate writer — a
writer not necessarily of polished technique (there are
unaccounted gaps in the narrative time frame, and in
spots his transitions seem abrupt), but one possessing a
freshness and lightness of touch. And his vision, while
not itself polished because it can never inherently be
such — for then it would be closed to the outside world,
a trait of the much mocked British middle class, after all
— springs from the pages with a quality of suggestive
imagination.
"Where Angels Fear to Tread" has several major
movements to it: it is the story of Lilia Theobald Her
riton, a 30-year-old widow and mother (her husband
Charles has died before the tale begins) and her travels
in Italy with family friend Caroline Abbott; it is the
story of Philip Herriton and his sister Harriet, Lilia's
brother-and-sister-in-laws, and their
journey to attempt to retrieve Lilia
after the muddle she gets into (a
marriage to a much younger Italian
— the son of a dentist, nonetheless);
and it is the story of Philip's, Har
riet's and Caroline's return to Italy to
recover Lilia's baby.
But most of all, it is the story of
the English abroad. And the Italy of
Forster's eye is, like the book itself, a
work of art: "And Philip, whom the
idea of Italy always intoxicated, had
started again, telling Lilia of the su
preme moments of her coming jour
ney — the Campanile of Arilo,
which would burst on her when she
emerged from the St. Gottard tun
nel, presaging the future; the view of
the Ticino and Lago Maggiore as the
train climbed the slopes of Monte
Cenere; the view of Lugano, the
view of Como — Italy gathering
thick around her now — the arrival
at her first resting-place, when, after
long driving through the dark and

dirty streets, she should at last be
hold, amid the roar of trams and the
glare of arc lamps, the buttresses of
the cathedral of Milan."
Lilia and Caroline stop in Mon
teriano, where the former meets
Gino Carella, a recently discharged
army man, currently unemployed,
and without professional prospects.
She marries him almost immedi
ately, but the cable that Caroline
sends home to England covers up
this fact, and says rather that Lilia is
engaged to an Italian nobleman.
This sends Philip to Monteriano to
try to talk some British sense into his
sister-in-law. It is only when he
arrives that he discovers the fait ac
compli, and after some proper con
frontations and one not so proper
with Gino, he and Miss Abbott
return to England.
On home turf, Caroline tells
Lilia's story of love, how she "went
out for a walk alone, saw that Italian
in a picturesque position on a wall,
and fell in love." Indeed, it is as -if
Lilia was entranced by the art, not
the humanity, of Gino, and fell for
romantic expectation. Thus, it is not

a surprise when the marriage falls
apart — for there was nothing to
hold it up. But the mystique of Italy
remains, as Caroline relates to
Philip, "I had got an idea that every
one here (in England) spent their
lives in making little sacrifices for
objects they didn't care for, to please
people they didn't love; that they
never learnt to be sincere — and,
what's as bad, never learnt how to
enjoy themselves."
After some surprising plot twists,
Philip, his sister and Caroline find
themselves in Monteriano again less
than two years later. The story
moves to its conclusion here (there
is a wonderful evening at the opera
in which Forster, whose attention to
music is observed in many of his
works, draws the very notes into his
characters' heads and sets the novel
into a dance), and what began as a
tale centering around Lilia becomes
instead a study of the formation of a
tempered British character — a
character that has questioned ac
cepted British values and found
them not so much inimical as sti
fling of human spirit and creativity.

It is not a character determined by
sex — both Philip and Caroline
grow toward redefinition. Philip in
particular sets himself into the
reader's sympathy. The romantic
feeling he develops for Caroline
converts him and moves him from
his position of seeing "life as a spec
tacle" into one in which he dis
covers "life was greater than he
supposed." He ceases to look at the
world as something static, as artwork
wraught in gold, but as an unfolding
mystery beckoning his participation.
Yet, as Forster adds, "life was even
less complete." For dislocation and
uncertainty accompany his trans
formation, and questions uncover
holes. Philip and Caroline ride out
of Italy, and out of the book, on the
very train that he had described to
Lilia early in the novel. But they are
traveling in the opposite direction;
they are going out, set to explore a
world bursting before them. And
when Philip turns to Caroline, the
only thing he can say to her is
"Thank you for everything." One
cannot think of more appropriate
words for Mr. Forster.

"Where Angels Fear to Tread"
By E.M. Forster
Vintage Books, $3.95
It is a delight to be in E.M. Forster's world. It is a
world of aesthetics and literature, of music, of
countryside, of architecture and of beauty. It has
romance about it. And because it is a world of British

BOOKS

pretension, it is also one of wit. In his first two novels,
"Where Angels Fear to Tread" (1905) and "A Room
With a View" (1908), he splits this world into two grand
sets, England and Italy.
The novels are not so much stories of the English or
of the Italians, but of the English in Italy, of the cool
Northern reserve when it meets its fiery Southern, or
Latin, counterpart. The latter book has been garnering
much attention lately, having been made into a splashy

movie and reprinted in editions sporting a colorful cover
photo. But his first published novel (Forster apparently
began "A Room With a View" in 1903, but finished it
after the publication of "Where Angels Fear to Tread")
is one that is not widely circulated today.
That is a shame, for it is a novel that is not only strik
ing for a first-time storyteller, but also one which has the
intelligence of a seasoned and consummate writer — a
writer not necessarily of polished technique (there are
unaccounted gaps in the narrative time frame, and in
spots his transitions seem abrupt), but one possessing a
freshness and lightness of touch. And his vision, while
not itself polished because it can never inherently be
such — for then it would be closed to the outside world,
a trait of the much mocked British middle class, after all
— springs from the pages with a quality of suggestive
imagination.
"Where Angels Fear to Tread" has several major
movements to it: it is the story of Lilia Theobald Her
riton, a 30-year-old widow and mother (her husband
Charles has died before the tale begins) and her travels
in Italy with family friend Caroline Abbott; it is the
story of Philip Herriton and his sister Harriet, Lilia's
brother-and-sister-in-laws, and their
journey to attempt to retrieve Lilia
after the muddle she gets into (a
marriage to a much younger Italian
— the son of a dentist, nonetheless);
and it is the story of Philip's, Har
riet's and Caroline's return to Italy to
recover Lilia's baby.
But most of all, it is the story of
the English abroad. And the Italy of
Forster's eye is, like the book itself, a
work of art: "And Philip, whom the
idea of Italy always intoxicated, had
started again, telling Lilia of the su
preme moments of her coming jour
ney — the Campanile of Arilo,
which would burst on her when she
emerged from the St. Gottard tun
nel, presaging the future; the view of
the Ticino and Lago Maggiore as the
train climbed the slopes of Monte
Cenere; the view of Lugano, the
view of Como — Italy gathering
thick around her now — the arrival
at her first resting-place, when, after
long driving through the dark and

dirty streets, she should at last be
hold, amid the roar of trams and the
glare of arc lamps, the buttresses of
the cathedral of Milan."
Lilia and Caroline stop in Mon
teriano, where the former meets
Gino Carella, a recently discharged
army man, currently unemployed,
and without professional prospects.
She marries him almost immedi
ately, but the cable that Caroline
sends home to England covers up
this fact, and says rather that Lilia is
engaged to an Italian nobleman.
This sends Philip to Monteriano to
try to talk some British sense into his
sister-in-law. It is only when he
arrives that he discovers the fait ac
compli, and after some proper con
frontations and one not so proper
with Gino, he and Miss Abbott
return to England.
On home turf, Caroline tells
Lilia's story of love, how she "went
out for a walk alone, saw that Italian
in a picturesque position on a wall,
and fell in love." Indeed, it is as -if
Lilia was entranced by the art, not
the humanity, of Gino, and fell for
romantic expectation. Thus, it is not

a surprise when the marriage falls
apart — for there was nothing to
hold it up. But the mystique of Italy
remains, as Caroline relates to
Philip, "I had got an idea that every
one here (in England) spent their
lives in making little sacrifices for
objects they didn't care for, to please
people they didn't love; that they
never learnt to be sincere — and,
what's as bad, never learnt how to
enjoy themselves."
After some surprising plot twists,
Philip, his sister and Caroline find
themselves in Monteriano again less
than two years later. The story
moves to its conclusion here (there
is a wonderful evening at the opera
in which Forster, whose attention to
music is observed in many of his
works, draws the very notes into his
characters' heads and sets the novel
into a dance), and what began as a
tale centering around Lilia becomes
instead a study of the formation of a
tempered British character — a
character that has questioned ac
cepted British values and found
them not so much inimical as sti
fling of human spirit and creativity.

It is not a character determined by
sex — both Philip and Caroline
grow toward redefinition. Philip in
particular sets himself into the
reader's sympathy. The romantic
feeling he develops for Caroline
converts him and moves him from
his position of seeing "life as a spec
tacle" into one in which he dis
covers "life was greater than he
supposed." He ceases to look at the
world as something static, as artwork
wraught in gold, but as an unfolding
mystery beckoning his participation.
Yet, as Forster adds, "life was even
less complete." For dislocation and
uncertainty accompany his trans
formation, and questions uncover
holes. Philip and Caroline ride out
of Italy, and out of the book, on the
very train that he had described to
Lilia early in the novel. But they are
traveling in the opposite direction;
they are going out, set to explore a
world bursting before them. And
when Philip turns to Caroline, the
only thing he can say to her is
"Thank you for everything." One
cannot think of more appropriate
words for Mr. Forster.
