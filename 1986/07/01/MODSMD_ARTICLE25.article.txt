Most Tex-Mex places are
either rough-and-tumble cowboy
bars or yuppie lounges that exclu
sively serve margaritas to over
worked mid-level executives.
Fortunately, Armadillo Willy's is
neither, but it is the best Tex-Mex
restaurant on the Peninsula. And
we've frequented Armadillo
Willy's enough to know that the
pleasant atmosphere, quick ser

this night was not unique.
Armadillo Willy's is the perfect
place to go when you don't want
to wear a tie, but you don't want
to be asked if your order is "for

a date, but it's also a good a place
to take the grandparents when
they visit Stanford for the first
time. And although your meal is
always promptly served, Ar
madillo Willy's is the kind of res
taurant where you wouldn't mind
waiting for your food if you had
to, for there are always the sweet
strains of Patsy Cline to listen to
while you're waiting.
On this night, we couldn't pass
