Most Tex-Mex places are
either rough-and-tumble cowboy
bars or yuppie lounges that exclu
sively serve margaritas to over
worked mid-level executives.
Fortunately, Armadillo Willy's is
neither, but it is the best Tex-Mex
restaurant on the Peninsula. And
we've frequented Armadillo
Willy's enough to know that the
pleasant atmosphere, quick ser
vice and great food we enjoyed

this night was not unique.
Armadillo Willy's is the perfect
place to go when you don't want
to wear a tie, but you don't want
to be asked if your order is "for
here or to go." It's a great idea for
a date, but it's also a good a place
to take the grandparents when
they visit Stanford for the first
time. And although your meal is
always promptly served, Ar
madillo Willy's is the kind of res
taurant where you wouldn't mind
waiting for your food if you had
to, for there are always the sweet
strains of Patsy Cline to listen to
while you're waiting.
On this night, we couldn't pass
up appetizers, ordering Willy's
Frozen Gold Margaritas ($2.50
each), made with Jose Cuervo
Premium Gold Tequila, and Tor
tilla Chips with Guacamole ($3.25).
Whereas many restaurants pile
lettuce two inches deep in a bowl
and spread guacamole thinly over
the top, Armadillo Willy's gives you
enough guacamole to last past the
tortilla chips and then some. And
best of all, the guacamole looks and
tastes like avacadoes — it's chunky,
so you know it's not just some mys
terious blend of greenery.
As experienced Willy's-diners, we
both ordered Fajitas al Carbon with
steak ($6.95). The fajitas come with
a choice of marinated charbroiled
steak or chicken, and are served with
grilled onions, bell peppers,
guacamole, salsa, sour cream and
frijoles beans, and of course, flour
tortillas. The steak arrives sizzling
on a steak fryer, ready for you to

build your own fajita tacos. The
steak is spiced to perfection, boldly,
but not too hot.
Willy's menu is extensive, high
lighted by BBQ Ribs — regular or
large platter ($6.95/$8.95), Sliced
Sirloin Platter ($6.95/$8.95) and
Tacos al Carbon ($4.95). A platter
includes Willy's Beans, potato salad
or cole slaw, and hot corn muffins
and butter. If you're in the mood for
a margarita, nachos ($4.25) or
Cadillac Nachos ($5.95) are good
choices. Willy's also serves an array
of burgers, including The Hickory
Burger ($3.75), Jalapeno Burger
($3.95) and the Guaco Bacon
Burger ($4.50).
At Armadillo Willy's, you should
go back enough times to try every
thing on the menu, but when you
have done that, stick with the fajitas
— they are by far the best.
The only thing we didn't like
about our visit to Armadillo Willy's
was the fact that we were a bit too
stuffed. Armadillo Willy's is
definitely the place to go if you're a
famished buckaroo.
