## Sox in Series, but Mets win all 
### 
Auburn's Bo Jackson has really done it, at least that's
what most "everyone" was saying until last week's bat
ting practice.
To temporarily silence the critics, who felt Jackson
should have stayed in the greener pastures of the NFL,
the Auburn superstar promptly — and most decisively
— cranked out seven and eight homeruns in the last two
Kansas City Royals' batting practices.
Sure, it's not the World Series, but then, who cares.
I'd say it's a little frightening to see a man who runs the
40-yard dash in under 4.2 seconds hit tape measure
shots to straight away center field.

Moreover, with his blinding speed, a normal infield
hit will probably become a double. A bunt single will
metamorphose into a RBI triple. A dropped fly ball will
be a inside the park homerun.
Stolen bases? Without a trustworthy abacus, it's diffi
cult to put this in proper numerical perspective. Let's
just say for now that he will steal more bases than the
Royals' own Steve "Bye Bye" Balboni. It's a safe estima
tion.
Undoubtedly, the Royals could use a guy like Jackson
as soon as possible. Deprived of the usual strong pitch
ing, Kansas City will find itself cheering on a new
American League champion.
Call them the Minnesota Twins. Don't laugh, I'm
serious. Witness the myriad of long-ball hitters that the
"We're going to win, Twins" possess. Kent Hrbek, Tom
Brunansky, Gary Gaetti and Kirby Puckett all have
more than 15 round-trippers.
Admittedly, there is the nagging matter of pitching.
By September, the Twins' collective earned run average
will be below 4.40 per game (it's currently 5.05 — worst

in the majors), which will be good enough to land them
a first place opening.
The Twins will most likely face the Boston Red Sox
in the East. OK, so I'm not really stretching out on the
proverbial limb, but remember what happened to the
Sox the last time they carried a big lead into the All-Star
break. They gagged.
That stated, time now to decipher the National
League's Western Division, a division with the likes of
the Houston Astros, and heaven forbid, the San Fran
cisco Giants vying for top gun.
But let's be frank, neither of these two teams will
bring home roses. Instead, and this hurts, the San Diego
Padres will represent this division in the playoffs this
fall.
San Diego has too much talent to remain in fourth
place, let alone third or second. By selecting them, I
have done the inexecusable. I have put Steve Garvey
back on prime-time television to show the world, once
more, his nauseating propensity to offend.
I'm not sure why he annoys me, but he somehow al
ways does something that is disgustingly militaristic, or
if nothing else, he just stands there. I could be a bit un
fair.
Finally, winding the bend, we enter the world of the
New York Mets — the National League East.
I guess I'll take a chance, why not — the Mets will
win this division.
Alas, the respective league playoffs march into the
living rooms of the American couch potatoes. In other
words, baseball truly gets exciting after a summer of
cheering for a cellar-dwelling team.
Who will win? In the American League playoffs, the
Red Sox will squeak by those fighting Twins. Minnesota
will be victimized by Boston's Roger "With a K"
Clemens, who by this time, will sport a 27-0 record.
The National League, well, need I say more than
New York. Four straight. Garvey bows out with a groin
pull.
Then we face the whole enchilada, the top banana
among fermenting prunes — the World Series. The
result: The Red Sox will do the American League proud;
they will last six games with the World Champion New
York Mets.
