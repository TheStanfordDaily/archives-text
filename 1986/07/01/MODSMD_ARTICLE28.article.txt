## 
### KEN STEVENS Editorial staff With wire reports 
Tim Mayotte, who spent his
college tennis career at Stanford,
advanced into the quarterfinals at
Wimbledon yesterday with a 6-3,
6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory over South
African Eddie Edwards.
The lanky Mayotte, seeded
No. 10 in the tournament will
have to wait until tomorrow to
see if his opponent in the next
round will be top-seeded Ivan
Lend! or American Matt Anger.
Lendl and Anger were knotted at
6-7 (7-9), 7-6 (7-2), 2-2 before
their match was suspended yes
terday due to darkness.
On the women's side, Kathy
Jordan, who also played at Stan
ford, was eliminated by second
seeded Chris Evert Lloyd. Jordan
had been successful against Lloyd
in the past at Wimbledon, but
yesterday the No. 16 seed was
dropped by the reigning French
Open champion, 7-5, 6-2.
The biggest upset of the tourn
ament was recorded yesterday by
Pat Cash in men's fourth-round
action. The Australian grass
court specialist, who just two
weeks ago had an emergency ap
pendectomy, upended the No. 2
seed, Mats Wilander of Sweden,
4-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-3.

"Obviously, I'm very happy,"
Cash said after the match. "I
suppose I'm a bit surprised too. I
really didn't expect it. Under the
circumstances, I'd say it was the
best tennis I've ever played."
Cash will have to register an
other upset to advance to the
semifinals. He drew seventh
seeded Henri Leconte of France
in the quarterfinals.
In the other big men's match
yesterday, defending champion
Boris Becker slugged his way to a
6-3, 7-6, 6-2 victory over No. B
Mikael Pernfors of Sweden.
"You can't see his serve, so you
can't really do anything about
that," said Pernfors, who defeated
Becker on his way to the final at
the French Open. "If he can play
like this and serve like this,
there's no way you can beat
him."
It was business as usual for
Martina Navratilova, the
women's top seed. Seeking her
fifth consecutive Wimbledon
singles crown, Navratilova has
yet to drop a set at the tourna
ment this year. Yesterday, she
rolled past France's Isabelle
Demongeot 6-3, 6-3.
Navratilova will battle West
Germany's Bettina Bunge in the
quarterfinals. Lloyd is pitted
against Czechoslovakia's Helena
Sukova, the No. 7 seed.
