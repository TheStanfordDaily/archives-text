# DU member pleads not guilty to charges
## 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
A Delta Upsilon fraternity mem
ber Wednesday entered a plea of not
guilty to misdemeanor charges of ar
son and vandalism stemming from
an incident at the fraternity in April.
Senior Tom Diliberti, not pres
ent at his arraignment before the
Palo Alto Municipal Court, entered
the plea through his attorney.
Both Diliberti and junior Steve
Gilland have been accused of setting
a couch on fire and throwing it from
a third-story balcony of the DU
house on April 12, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Gilland, who faces the same
charges as Diliberti, said his arraign
ment is scheduled for early this
month. He speculated that the ear
liest his or Diliberti's case could go
to trial would be "sometime next
year."
The Santa Clara County District
Attorney s Office filed charges
against the two students early in
June.
University officials disbanded the
DUs on May 6 and reclaimed their
house, citing a "lengthy history of

destructive and anti-social behavior
at the fraternity."
Following an investigation by the
Stanford police, warrants were
issued June 4 for the arrest of both
Gilland and Diliberti, said Deputy
District Attorney Victor Green. Gil
land and Diliberti were booked,
scheduled for arraignment and
"released on their own recog
nizance," Niemeyer said.
If convicted of misdemeanor ar
son, Diliberti and Gilland could
face a maximum $1,000 fine and up
to a year in jail, Green explained.
Misdemeanor vandalism, the other
charge filed in the case, carries a
possible $1,000 fine and a maxi
mum six-month jail term, he said.
According to a June 3 police
report filed by Niemeyer, "Gilland
and Diliberti removed a University
owned couch from room 319 (of the
DU house) and carried it to a bal
cony railing." At that point,
"Gilland ignited the couch amidst
protestations from other DU mem
bers. Gilland and Diliberti then
threw the couch from the balcony,"
the report reads.
Niemeyer also indicated in the
report that he was investigating
Diliberti "on a $2,500 vandalism to
the Sigma Chi House" May 30.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano
confirmed that there was "some
suspicion" that DUs had been in
volved in the breaking of a picture
window at the Sigma Chi fraternity
during Dead Week of spring quar
ter.
The report concluded with a re
commendation that felony arson
charges be brought against the two
suspects. But Green, the prosecut

ing attorney in the case, decided in
-1 stead to file misdemeanor charges
because there had been "no direct
threat to the (DU house) structure."
"The couch was set on fire
outside of the structure ... on a
balcony," Green explained. "Had
the [building] been damaged, it
would have been a felony," he said.
"We certainly didn't light it (the
couch) inside the house," Gilland
said of the incident. He declined to
comment further.
Diliberti also chose not to discuss
the case. "I don't think I should be
talking to you guys right now," he
said.
