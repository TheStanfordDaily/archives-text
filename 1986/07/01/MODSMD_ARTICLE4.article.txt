# Abortions unlikely on campus
## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
This spring, more than 20 students at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center faced three alternatives:
therapeutic abortion; carrying a child to term and
keeping it; or giving it up for adoption. Most chose
abortion.
Last spring, 190 Stanford women went to Cowell
for pregnancy tests. About a quarter of the women
tested positive. Less than half of these women,
however, wanted to be pregnant, according to
Connie Starr, a nurse practitioner at Cowell.
Like nearly all university campuses across the na
tion, Stanford does not offer abortions at the student
health center. According to Dr. Paul Walters, direc
tor of Cowell, UC-Berkeley is the only university to
offer abortions at their student health center.
Cowell provides decision counseling for women
who test positive on a pregnancy test, but a woman
must find a clinic or private practitioner off campus
to perform the abortion.
Imagine yourself faced with the decision of what to
do with an unwanted pregnancy. Though it is often a
difficult decision, many Stanford women say they
would have an abortion.
And now imagine yourself sitting in an examina
tion room at a strange office in Redwood City.
Around you are many unfamiliar faces, like the nurse
who is taking your blood pressure and the receptionist
who tried to make you feel more at ease when you
first came in. You look around anxiously, wondering
what's going to happen next. The doctor enters, and

after an introduction and a few brief words, you
decide that he seems like a nice person.
Several students feel that leaving campus increases
the anxiety of having an abortion, especially since
many are unfamiliar with the cities around Stanford.
At the same time, "if I had an abortion at Cowell, I
probably would be reminded of it every time I went
there," said one undergraduate. "By going some
where else, I could forget about it and never see the
place again."
Beyond going elsewhere to find the office, having
to meet new people and trying to quickly acquire a
feeling of trust can only make this undesirable experi
ence more difficult. Some students also cited trans
portation problems as a factor which would make an
abortion on campus a more favorable option.
One advantage of having abortions available
through Cowell would be "continuity of care," Starr
said. Instead of leaving the security of the Stanford
campus and having to cope with new people, women
would be able to receive counseling, undergo the
procedure and have access to post-surgery support
services at Cowell.
On the other hand, although all treatment and
counseling is strictly confidential at Cowell, students
feel more assured of their anonymity elsewhere.
Indeed, most women said they were very con
cerned with anonymity and, if given the choice, most
said they would probably choose an off-campus
locaton for an abortion.
Psychological counseling is available through
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS),
both prior to and following an abortion. If a
woman decides she should have an abortion,
Cowell may refer her to various local clinics.
Cowell only refers students to people with
whom they are familiar. Doctors and nurses visit
clinics on a regular basis to ensure the quality of
treatment students will receive, Starr said.
Feedback from students is also very important.
If a student has a bad experience at a particular
clinic, the staff investigates the complaint. After
re-evaluation, Cowell might stop recommending
the clinic in order to assure quality treatment for
students.
Walters explained that because Cowell is not
equipped or insured to perform surgical proce
dures such as abortion, the center cannot perform
the operation. To include abortion in the student
health plan would increase the center's liability
and open the door for other types of medical
specialties as well.

Secondly, surgical procedures are not included
in student health fees. All universities, including
Berkeley, pay the cost of abortion through health
insurance plans rather than by student fees.
Finally, if Cowell were to offer abortions, "it
should also offer a complete range of obstetric and
gynecological services which would duplicate those
already available at the Palo Alto Medical Clinic,
to which students may be referred," Walters said.
If Cowell offered abortion services but did not
offer pre- and post-natal care, students might in
correctly infer that Cowell advocated abortion
over maintaining an unwanted pregnancy.
Since abortions are readily available locally,
such a program through Cowell would not be cost
effective. Additionally, Cowell is not able to col
lect third-party payments from MediCal and indi
vidual health insurance policies.
In the Bay Area, the cost of an abortion during
the first trimester of pregnancy averages
aproximately $200. Private practitioners often
charge more.
Many universities including Berkeley, Harvard
and Yale have a student health program that

funds abortions under mandatory student
health insurance policies.
Each student at these universities is required to
pay a separate registration fee for the insurance
coverage. Harvard and Yale offer small refunds to
those students who are strongly opposed to abor
tion.
At Stanford, fees allocated to Cowell from stu
dent tuition are put into a general fund, and regis
tered students receive health care without extra
cost. And since abortion is a sensitive moral issue,
Walters noted that if Cowell were to provide abor
tions under the present system, there would have
to be an opportunity for students against abortion
not to contribute to this funding. All universities
offer some form of optional student health insur
ance in addition to coverage from mandatory in
surance or health fees, Walters added.
Walters, Starr and many students alike feel that
the present referral service adequately serves the
needs of women at Stanford. While some would
like to see abortions available at Cowell, it seems
unlikely that there will be any change in the near
future.
