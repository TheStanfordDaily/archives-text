# Abortions unlikely on campus
## 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
This spring, more than 20 students at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center faced three alternatives:
therapeutic abortion; carrying a child to term and
keeping it; or giving it up for adoption. Most chose
abortion.
Last spring, 190 Stanford women went to Cowell
for pregnancy tests. About a quarter of the women
tested positive. Less than half of these women,
however, wanted to be pregnant, according to
Connie Starr, a nurse practitioner at Cowell.
Like nearly all university campuses across the na
tion, Stanford does not offer abortions at the student
health center. According to Dr. Paul Walters, direc
tor of Cowell, UC-Berkeley is the only university to
offer abortions at their student health center.
Cowell provides decision counseling for women
who test positive on a pregnancy test, but a woman
must find a clinic or private practitioner off campus
to perform the abortion.
Imagine yourself faced with the decision of what to
do with an unwanted pregnancy. Though it is often a
difficult decision, many Stanford women say they
would have an abortion.
And now imagine yourself sitting in an examina
tion room at a strange office in Redwood City.
Around you are many unfamiliar faces, like the nurse
who is taking your blood pressure and the receptionist
who tried to make you feel more at ease when you
first came in. You look around anxiously, wondering
what's going to happen next. The doctor enters, and

after an introduction and a few brief words, you
decide that he seems like a nice person.
Several students feel that leaving campus increases
the anxiety of having an abortion, especially since
many are unfamiliar with the cities around Stanford.
At the same time, "if I had an abortion at Cowell, I
probably would be reminded of it every time I went
there," said one undergraduate. "By going some
where else, I could forget about it and never see the
place again."
Beyond going elsewhere to find the office, having
to meet new people and trying to quickly acquire a
feeling of trust can only make this undesirable experi
ence more difficult. Some students also cited trans
portation problems as a factor which would make an
abortion on campus a more favorable option.
One advantage of having abortions available
through Cowell would be "continuity of care," Starr
said. Instead of leaving the security of the Stanford
campus and having to cope with new people, women
would be able to receive counseling, undergo the
procedure and have access to post-surgery support
services at Cowell.
On the other hand, although all treatment and
counseling is strictly confidential at Cowell, students
feel more assured of their anonymity elsewhere.
Indeed, most women said they were very con
cerned with anonymity and, if given the choice, most
said they would probably choose an off-campus
locaton for an abortion.
