# Former football coach Christiansen dies at 57
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial staff 
Jack Christiansen, a former Stan
ford and San Francisco 49ers head
coach and a member of three sports
hall of fames, died of cancer yester
day at the Stanford Medical Center.
He was 57.
Three years ago, Christiansen was
diagnosed as having lung and
prostate cancer, which, despite
chemotherapy, spread to his bones.
Until his illness forced his retire
ment, Christiansen had been in
volved with football for 36 years,
starting in 1948 with his varsity years
at Colorado A&M (currently known
as Colorado State) and finishing as
an assistant coach with the National
Football League's Alanta Falcons in
1983.
Before becoming a coach at Stan
ford, Christiansen had an excellent
professional football career with the
Detroit Lions, where he won six All-
Pro honors. He was later inducted
into the NFL Hall of Fame in Can
ton, Ohio. In 1968, Christiansen
joined the Stanford coaching staff as

an assistant under then head coach
John Ralston.
In 1972, after Ralston moved on
to the professional ranks, Christian
sen was appointed Cardinal head
coach, a position which he held un
til 1976.
During his approximate five-year
stint as Stanford head coach, Chris
tiansen's teams compiled a 31-22-3
record — a record particularly im
pressive because college football was
steadily becoming more competitive
in virtually every conference.
Throughout his football career,
both as a player and a coach, he was
praised by his friends and associates
for his honest and determined dis
position — a man of great integrity.
"(Christiansen) was one of those
rare people who had no pretenses,
who had a great affinity for all the
people he dealt with," said former
Stanford and 49ers quarterback John
Brodie in an interview with the San
Jose Mercury News. "I've never
known anyone quite like him in that
regard.
"He made a lot of players better
by the respect he demanded on the

field," Brodie continued. "He got a
lot of guys to play better than they
were able to because he treated them
that way — with respect. I'm a better
person for having played for him."
Dr. Don Bunce, currently the
Stanford football team physician
and former quarterback under
Ralston and Christiansen in 1971,
described Christiansen as "always up
front and honest" in an interview
with the Times Tribune.
"He's somebody I certainly had a
great deal of respect for," Bunce
said. "When he walked into a room,
there was a real sense of him being
somebody you wanted to get to
know."
Christiansen's final year at Stan
ford was not one without contro
versy. Many criticized his handling
of his two quarterbacks, Guy Ben
jamin and Matt Cordova. Christain
sen was known to shuffle the two
players in and out of the starting
line-up. Most of the' students and
alumni preferred the more exciting
Benjamin while Christiansen stuck
mostly with Cordova.
Despite such skepticism, Bunce

told the Times Tribune that Chris
tiansen "handled the situation as
well as could be expected," adding
that the decision was "a hard one to
make."
Eventually succeeded by Bill
Walsh, the current 49ers head
coach, Christiansen went back to
professional football where he
became an assistant at Kansas City,

J Seattle and finally Atlanta.
Christiansen is survived by his
wife, Doris, and four daughters,
Janet Burkhart, Joni Smith, Jacki
Kendall and Terri Mason. A schol
arship fund will be established by
the Stanford Athletic Department in
his name. The memorial service is
scheduled for 6 p.m. tomorrow at
the Stanford Golf Course.
