# New CPPC director appointed
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Ruth Schneider has been named director of the
Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC) by
James Lyons, dean of Student Affairs.
Schneider, a CPPC staff member since 1967, has
served as its associate director for the past six years. She
replaces Christopher Shinkman, who accepted a posi
tion in May with Ward Associates, a Menlo Park-based
firm which supplies job counseling for senior execu
tives.
The CPPC offers graduate and undergraduate stu
dents a variety of services, including career counseling
and assistance with job placement.
As director, Schneider will manage a staff of 25 as
well as 30-35 student assistants employed by the center
each academic quarter, she said.
Schneider said she is currently considering making
changes in the services offered by the center. *
"We are in the process of reviewing the services that
we've been offering," she said, adding that any changes
would be decided over the summer.
Schneider said she has plans for an advisory board de
signed to ensure that the CPPC's services are the same
ones students think are important, she said.
The board, still in its planning stages, would consist
of faculty, students and representatives from other
centers working closely with the CPPC, including the
Bechtel International Center, the Public Service Center
and the Undergraduate Advising Center.

The board would help the various centers comple
ment one another and serve as a "natural link of com
munication to make sure we're going in the right direc
tion," she said.
One of the CPPC's goals is improving communica
tion between students and the center, she said.
As part of this "concerted effort to improve communi
cation," Schneider hopes to make students aware of the
CPPC's services earlier in their Stanford careers.
Many of the CPPC's services are applicable to fresh
men and sophomores, she said, citing part-time em
ployment and internship opportunities.
Schneider's duties as director will include overseeing
the three main areas of the center. The first area pro
vides students with counseling and resources, the
second concerns organizing job recruitment on campus
by companies, and the third involves administration and
records, she said.
The administration and records area includes not
only the center's own budget and personnel files but also
student records. The CPPC collects, photocopies and
mails out information such as faculty letters of recom
mendation required by graduate schools, Schneider
said.
Because of this service, professors do not have to write
several different letters of recommendation for students
applying to more than one graduate school, she said.
Schneider received her master's degree from the Stan
ford School of Education in 1967. She has since taught
science and Spanish.
