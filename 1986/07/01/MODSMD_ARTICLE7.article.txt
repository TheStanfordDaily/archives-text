### BRUCE BROWN Staff writer 
University and United Stanford Workers officials will
meet this week in an attempt to resolve tension in their
relationship regarding the union's contract signed last
year.
The major issues on the USW's agenda concern
worker representation and union access to the
workplace, as well as the reinstatement of Victor Hill, a
union worker dismissed last year after being accused of
vandalism, according to USW Secretary Dennis Blake.
USW represents over 1,300 service, technical and
maintenance workers at the University.
The situation is one of "pockets of problems" stem

bound to be some problems. We are not sure of what all
the problems are, but we are trying to respond to every
thing that we know of," said Rosemary Monroe, assis

tract stipulates that only one union representative may

accompany a worker to a grievance hearing; however,
the University may send any number of people who
"because of their knowledge of the facts, contribute to
an appropriate review of the grievance."
The University lawyers are trying to "go beyond the
intent" of this provision, Blake said.
They have not been faithful to the spirit of the lan
guage and have sent people to hearings in which they do
not play an essential role, he said.
This disparity of attendance, Blake added, naturally
results in intimidation of the worker.
Monroe agreed that there have been instances,
though "not too many," of unequal representation at
grievence hearings.
The University has been sincere in ensuring that no
one would be present at a hearing "without good rea
son," she added.
Blake also charged that the University has translated
the contract in such a way so as to essentially prevent the
union from entering the workplace except during break
periods and lunch hour.
Certain workers could be addressed without infring
ing upon their capacity to perform, Blake said, giving
the example of a photocopyist.
In such a case, the worker is not unsettled from his
