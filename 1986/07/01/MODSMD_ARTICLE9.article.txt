# UPDATE
## Shultz does not rule out sanctions against Pretoria 
### 
WASHINGTON - Secretary
of State George Shultz said yes
terday that the Administration ex
pected to complete its review of
South Africa policy within the
next 20 days and, in a departure
from his usual position, he did
not rule out economic sanctions
against the white minority gov
ernment.
Talking to reporters aboard his
airplane on the way home from a
10-day tour of the Far East,
Shultz said the Administration
was rethinking its policies toward
all of southern Africa, including
the black-governed states on
South Africa's borders.
He said that economic sanc
tions against Pretoria should be
coupled with increased financial
aid to nearby states that are
economically dependent on
South Africa.
"1 expect that about two-thirds
of the way through July, we will
be ready to say what we have to
say on the subject, possibly in
congressional testimony," Shultz
said.
The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee has scheduled a
hearing on South Africa for July
22. Presumably that is the target
date for the Administration's
policy review.
A senior Administration offi
cial with President Reagan in
Santa Barbara disclosed Saturday
that the reassessment was under
way.
Shultz refused to describe the
nature of the evolving policy, but
when he was asked if it would in
clude economic sanctions, he
declined to answer directly al

though he left little doubt that he
continues to consider sanctions to
be undesirable. In the past, when
faced with such a question,
Shultz has ruled out sanctions on
the grounds that they would hurt
South African blacks and the
neighboring black states even
more than the Pretoria govern
ment.
However, Shultz said that adv
ocates of sanctions should con
sider the economic impact on the
rest of the region of actions
against South Africa.
Talking to reporters on the out
bound leg of the trip 10 days ago,
Shultz said that the Administra
tion was following a policy of
steady pressure against South
Africa to dismantle the apartheid
system of racial discrimination.
He said that House-passed legis
lation requiring total withdrawal
of all U.S. contacts with Pretoria,
including business disinvest
ment, would torpedo that policy
and leave Washington without
influence. Shultz reiterated his
opposition to the House bill yes
terday, The legislation is awaiting
action in the Senate.
Asked why the Administration
launched its current policy
review, Shultz said, "The facts
on the ground have changed, so
we are in the process of looking at
what's happening and reviewing
what it is possible for us to do.
There is an increased level of vio
lence. We see an interplay of ef
forts to move substantively away
from apartheid but in a kind of
two-steps-forward, one-three
four-steps-back ward way."
