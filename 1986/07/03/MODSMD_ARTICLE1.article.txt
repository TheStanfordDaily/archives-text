# DUs charged for damages; Res Ed to stiffen penalty
## 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
Based on the discovery of nearly
$20,000 in property damage to the
University-owned Delta Upsilon fra
ternity house, University officials
plan to impose a lengthening of the
fraternity's revocation period, said
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
Student Affairs.
Although a final decision has not
yet been reached, Conklin said yes
terday that "the awful shape of the
house," coupled with other
"unacceptable behavior'' by DU
members this spring, has made it
"obvious that [the period of revoca
tion! is going to be lengthened."
The University revoked recogni
tion of the DUs May 6 and ter
minated their housing privileges,
citing "a lengthy history of
destructive and anti-social behavior
at the fraternity." Conditions of the
revocation stipulate that the DUs be
barred from any activity on campus
for two years. Only after that time
can the fraternity petition to regain
probationary University recognition.
Conklin said that a letter an
nouncing an "extension", pf the
DUs' revocation period would be

drafted and sent to DU members
"sometime this summer.''
The extent of destruction at the
DU house is "extraordinarily large,"
according to Norm Robinson, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs. A
damage bill totalling $19,636.13 has
been charged to members of the fra
ternity, Conklin said.
Conklin explained that
$13,606.64 worth of damage had
been found in "common areas' of
the DU house and would be assessed
proportionally to all residents of the
fraternity. Additionally, $6,029.49
of damage was discovered in individ
ual bedrooms and will be billed to
the residents of those rooms, Con
klin said. Individual room bills
range up to $680.00, she added.
Conklin said the fact that the DUs
"went ahead and pledged" a new
class of members "when they'd been
told not to" had also contributed to
the University's decision to stiffen its
punishment of the fraternity.
According to DU member Dave
Supple, who was DU rush chairman
this spring, the University "never
said we could have no pledges." The
Office of Residential Education
".ncv£.r .specifically Qi.rtl.uird what it
wanted us to do about pledges," said

Supple, a senior. "They kept us in a
haze about that. "
When University inspectors first
assessed damage to the house shortly
after Commencement, they found
"a lot of broken windows, a lot of
broken and missing furniture (and)
some roof damage . . . from people
walking around up there," Conklin
said.
Inspectors also discovered "vomit
on the outside walls under the win
dows," she said. Workers "had to
power wash the front door and the
rear entrance, and that implies
vomit," Conklin added.
"That's bullshit. That's com
pletely untrue," Supple said. "We
cleaned everything up."
Supple questioned the legitimacy
of the University's damage es
timates. "I can't imagine that there
is that much damage," he said.
Much of the damage can be
traced to the age of the DU house it
self and not to the actions of this
year's DU residents, Supple said.
"It's a really old house. [The Uni
versity] is using that as a very good
excuse to get as much money out of
us as possible," he said.
