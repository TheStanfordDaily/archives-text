Protest Waldheim
On June 8 the citizens of Austria
chose Kurt Waldheim to be the
symbolic leader of their nation. The
electoral campaign was conducted
under the intense scrutiny of the
world press because Waldheim's ac
count of his actions during World
War II became implausible.
As members of this university we
should consider two questions:
• Are the allegations true that
Waldheim was a willing and signifi
cant participant in Nazi atrocities?
• If these allegations are true, how
should Stanford University respond
to his victory?
I believe that the available
evidence supports the publicized al
legations against Waldheim. For
those who wish to study this contro
versy in greater detail, ample facts
are ably presented in two articles by
Peter Kubin which have recently ap
peared in The New Republic (sec
April 7 and June 16 issues).
Waldheim did not just cover up as
sociations with unseemly characters,
but was also responsible for activities
that can only be characterized .is
"war crimes."
I he Yugoslav Commission on
War Crimes considered Waldheim's
case in December 1947. As Lubin
explains, "after examining the role
of his unit and his special duties and
after hearing the testimony of several
witnesses, the commission adjudged
Kurt Waldheim to be a 'war crimi
nal' whose extradition was
'mandatory.' "
Foremost among the accusations
was one regarding an atrocity against
partisans which took place in the
vicinity of Kozane and Stip in
Yugoslavia October 14, 1944. In
this operation, the Germans, under
the command of Capt. Karl-
Heinz Egberts-Hilker burned down
the villages of Krupiste, Gorni Bal
van and Donily Balvan, and killed
their inhabitants. Egberts-Hi lker ad
mitted that he led the raid and was

hanged in Belgrade in 1948 for this
crime. In December 1947 Egberts-
Hilker ". . . testified that the order
for the killings had come from Kurt
Waldheim."
Given the preponderance of
evidence against Waldheim and that
he has been caught in numerous lies
about the subject, what should Stan
ford do? I do not believe that
Waldheim's election signals a return
of fascism to Europe. However, it
demonstrated the unwillingness of a
majority of Austrians to recognize
and condemn that nation's connec
tion to Nazism.
I believe that there should be an
official American response which
would convey our abhorrence of this
electoral outcome, but at this time it
appears that our government does
not intend to make such a state
ment.
Consequently, it is incumbent
upon Stanford and its students, as it
is on all other Americans, to partici
pate in symbolic actions that will
register our disapproval of Austria's
choice.
We should act for many reasons,
but, at the very least, it should never
be forgotten that the civilian death
toll in Yugoslavia and Greece
during World War II was staggering.
It is estimated that at least 1.2
million Yugoslav civilians died as a
result of the war. In Grecce, some
620,000 died, including 360,000
who died of starvation.
I propose two actions. First, the
University should end its program of
study in Vienna until Waldheim's
term expires. Second, the Stanford
student body should suspend the
Viennese Ball until Waldheim
leaves office. These are measures
that entail real costs to our commu
nity, but I advocate them because
we must protest the Austrian refusal
to repudiate Kurt Waldheim and the
inhumane political ideology which
he so willingly served during World
War 11.
