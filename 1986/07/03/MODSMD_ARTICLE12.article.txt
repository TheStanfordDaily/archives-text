# Summer is for people-learning
## 
### 
Summer session at Stanford is weird. Look at all the
people around you. There are hordes of tourists who
drive from Duluth, Minn., just to come and see our
playground. They keep the Bookstore in business,
buying anything with "Stanford" on it, while we
grumble at the high prices for Macintosh disks.
Walking in bunches of at least six are high school
football players on their way to Tresidder to grab a
burger before afternoon workout. I guess it is taboo to be

seen in public with, God forbid, less than five other
people. They can't wait to get back out into the hot sun
and sweat. You can't wait to get to DeGuerre Pool and
cool off.
Graduate students abound — yet, for them, it is not
desirable to be seen with any other beings, unless of
course it is their good old dependable bike, which they
know on a first name basis. Do they really have to study
that hard all year round? And do they really need rear
view mirrors attached to their helmets?
Business people in charcoal gray suits and official
looking name tags are here "conferencing.'' They don't
seem to have business-like looks on their faces,
however. I bet they just sit around, drink martinis and
swap lewd jokes.
Finally, there are those of us who blend into the
scenery during the school year, but now stick out by the
mere fact that we seem to fit in pretty well. Yes, we do
know how to get to History Corner. Yes, we do know
that the Co Po is really called the Co Po, and not the
burdensome "Corner Pocket."
The reason that summer session is odd is that it is
profoundly more real.
Yes, real. During the school year, we never seem to
be interested in people-watching. To do that, we have to
go to San Francisco Airport at midnight.
Instead, we just hop on our red cruiser bicycles, put
on our sunglasses, and coast to our nine o'clock class at
9:15. We might say "hey" to our acquaintances, but we

never really get a chance to investigate a more interest
ing group of people.
Sure, in September Stanford students are diverse.
You have your freshman roommate from Fresno who
chews tobacco and talks about duck-hunting all the
time. And there's the woman down the hall who is from
Long Island and wears a lot of makeup, earrings and big
hair.
But by February, at the latest, it seems we all achieve
the Stanford "image" pretty darn well. It is not that we
are all totally the same, but rather that we have all
merged into a generally homogeneous mini-society.
Things run smoothly on campus, yet we forget about
the other sorts of people who exist in the world. Not
only do we drop from recollection the likenesses of high
school football players, business people and tourists, but
we also ignore the people in the outside world, not to
mention the humanity just across El Camino.
Some people, such as the vagabond I met the other
day, do not exist, as far as we can tell. This man sat
down next to me in an older part of Palo Alto, took out
his bottle of white wine, and told me he majored in
marine biology and psychiatry at Stanford and currently
does ceramics for a living. Oh yeah, he knew that the
Chernobyl nuclear incident would happen before it did
— it was just that they forgot to consult him.
We also forget about anyone outside the 18-25 age
group, unless of course we frequent fraternity parties or
Palo Alto retirement homes. We forget about anything
or anybody that is beyond our blinders. Maybe this is
beneficial for a few years out of our lives. Maybe it is
desirable to be purely intellectual and theoretical while
we can, and not distracted by the mundane world
around us.
Yet, people are a tremendous resource, and we must
not ignore them. Maybe we could learn a lot from the
tourists from Minnesota if we only tried. We could even
gain something from the high schoolers, I wager.
Having people around to debate, explore and laugh
with, is one of the ultimate pleasures in life, and we
should take advantage of this, particularly in the sum
mer.
Sure," the 17 years old who approaches you doesn't
know how to get to Roble Gym. But I do know that she
could tell you how to get to her gym at home, and quite
possibly even a little bit more that could make you stop
and think.
Maybe summer session isn't weird after all.
