# Farm reacts to sodomy ruling
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Editorial staff 
Both students and scholars here differed sharply in
their reactions to Monday's Supreme Court ruling that
the Constitution does not protect homosexual conduct
between consenting adults, even in the privacy of their
own homes.
The controversial ruling, handed down by a bitterly
divided court, marks a turning point in the expansion of
the doctrine of privacy, through which the court has
treaded the past 60 years. Some students here were
stunned by the 5-4 ruling. Others were pleased.
Two law professors declined to comment.
The ruling reflects "a Reagan mood" in the court,
said Law School Prof. Paul Brest, 'it is a decision that
reflects the right. This is to please the right," he said.
The decision makes a sharp distinction between
choices in heterosexual life — which include choices of
abortion and use of contraception — and the decision to
engage in homosexual conduct.
Given the court's precedents, the distinction is a diffi
cult one to make, Brest said. "The precedents suggest a
different result," he said.
The controversial issue in the ruling is much broader
than a choice of sex acts. It encompasses how
homosexuality will be treated under the Constitution,
Brest said.
"I was pleased overall that the Supreme Court didn't
make fools of themselves by redefining the Constitu

tion," said Kirk Cameron, graduate student in statistics.
"I don't believe our forefathers ever envisioned
homosexual acts — either in the bedroom or in public
— as a right."
Cameron said the ruling didn't restrict rights of
privacy, but rather limits privileges of privacy.
"Anything done in public or in private must be weighed
against society's rights," he said. "You must weigh the
risks."
He lauded the ruling as an effective way to curb
the spread of AIDS.
Toni Fitzpatrick, a law student who studied the con
stitutionality of sodomy laws in a special project last se
mester, said the decision will not stop people from en
gaging in oral or anal sex and will not curb the spread of
AIDS. Its biggest effect will be to "give a green light for
violence against gay men and lesbians," she said.
The ruling does not necessarily allow for discrimina
tion against homosexuals in other contexts. But it will
slow the advancement of homosexual rights, several stu
dents agreed.
Fitzpatrick, who called the ruling "fascist" and
"psychotic," said it will have several dangerous and far
reaching effects. By "maintaining that gays and lesbians
are criminals ... it will validate people not getting jobs
and child custody because they are seen as felons."
Sophomore Joycc Adams, a member of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, agreed. "They won't just
be quoting God anymore," she said.
