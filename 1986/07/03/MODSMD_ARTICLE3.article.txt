The takeover of the Univer
sity's Microcomputer Discount
Program by the Stanford
Bookstore June 13 will likely lead
to improved service, but no price
changes, for computer products,
according to University and
Bookstore officials.
The University first introduced
the program, called Microdisc,
two years ago in order to enable
students, faculty and staff to pur
chase microcomputers at a dis
count.
Tom Goodrich, an academic
computing specialist for the Uni
versity, explained the reasons for
the change. Microdisc was
originally conceived "with the
idea that ... at some point we
should look at options for getting
it out of the University/' he said.

He cited refunds and order
cancellations as examples of
processes that were "difficult to
implement with the University
auditing system."
Retail sales are "not the sort of
thing universities in general are
particularly good at," he said.
The Bookstore is "primarily of
fering the same product and
prices" formerly available
through the University, accord
ing to Phil Chiaramontc,
Bookstore assistant general
manager.
Any price changes will
originate with the companies that
manufacture the computers, ac
cording Richard Marcjuez, direc
tor of the Microdisc program for
the Bookstore.
