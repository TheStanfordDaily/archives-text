# Summer non-students seek sun and situations

"It's a holding pen for non-existent ambi
tion, said junior Andrew Patzman. "Maybe
they have overabundant inertia."
"There's time to look around," countered
junior Bruce Brown. "It's refreshing to browse
at Kepler's Bookstore without worrying about
finals. It's refreshing to have time for a
smoothie at the Plantation Cafe.
Why do so many Stanford students choose
to live on or near campus over the summer,
especially if they are not taking classes? To the
casual visitor, the campus appears deserted
during the summer months; dorms arc closed.

post office lines are short and bicycle traffic is
virtually non-existent.
In fact, between July and September ap
proximately 450 students remain on campus
and perhaps an equal 'number live in the
nearby off-campus area, according to figures
supplied by the Housing Center and the
various student living groups. Of those, 388
students are registered for the summer quarter,
leaving about the same number who are not.
I he non-students fall into two categories:
the majority, which arranged well in advance
to have jobs cither on campus or nearby, and
the fringe, which found temporary employ
ment as the need arose. All agreed on two
points: that the jobs and wages in this area are

better than those at home and that they are
loathe to give up their independence.
Because Brown is leaving the country at the
end of July, he plans to stay on campus until
that time, and has arranged a data entry job at
the National Youth Law Center on campus.
He also wants first-hand knowledge: "Stanford
during the year and Stanford during the sum
mer are two different worlds; (the summer)
gives me a chance to explore the area.''
Pat/man, on the other hand, decided to stay
because "if you had the jobs I had last sum
mer, you'd stay too." One of these jobs was
working as a waiter and meat carver on some
"overpriced dinner cruises that go up and
down the Missouri River." Figuring that such

jobs were not his bailiwick, he took the posi
tion of news editor at The Daily and is becom
ing involved with the Martin Luther King jr.
papers project.
The find-job-later phenomenon seems to be
primarily a condition of juniors, especially if
they had gone home the summer after their
freshman year only to find jobs there unsatisfy
ing. The phenomenon also occurs with
seniors who have just graduated.
"My life is in limbo," said recent graduate
and Coffee House worker Rob Martinez. "1
basically hung around because I had no idea
what I was going to do over the summer. I'd
also never been in California in the summer,"
he added.
The "summer-in-California-beats-suiTimer
anywhere-else" attitude proved to be one of
the more seductive reasons to stay. Most stu
dents, however, had additional reasons.
Research was one. "I'm from a small town
in Ohio, so going home was never an alterna
tive," said Atul Gawande, a senior who is

doing research in the Ophthalmology Depart
ment of the Medical Center, a convenient
source of employment for many students.
Quite a few students do unpaid research
work on campus and obtain part-time jobs
elsewhere for subsistence. Gawande got an
evening job at The Coffee House his freshman
summer because his lab work at that time was
unpaid. "When I appeared to be valuable in
some way, (they) decided to pay me," he said.
Some students opted for business experi
ence. Senior Sara Record is one of the sum
mer managers of The Coffee House. "I don't

like the Midwest/' she said. "I feel like my life
is pretty much out here." Record had been
managing The Coffee House since last fall and
snapped up the summer managership because
she needed to make some money for next year.
"You meet some really cool people over the
summer," she added.
Does the find-job-later crowd in fact find
jobs later? "Over the summer, we get about
1,200 to 1,400 listings for jobs," reported
Lynne Mason, coordinator of Undergraduate
Programs at the Career Planning and Place
ment Center. "Most of them get filled; the gar

dening and housework jobs don't go real fast,
though."
Off-campus temporary help agencies also
do brisk business. Amanda Marshall, the comp
troller at Career Resources in Town &
Country Village, said her office places about
40 students in clerical or word-processing jobs
for the summer.
"It's easy to get a job," concluded Mason. "If
you don't mind taking a couple of part-time
jobs, you can survive-out here. "
