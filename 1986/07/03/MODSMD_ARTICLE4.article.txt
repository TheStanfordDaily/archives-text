# Summer non-students seek sun and situations

"It's a holding pen for non-existent ambi
tion, said junior Andrew Patzman. "Maybe
they have overabundant inertia."
"There's time to look around," countered
junior Bruce Brown. "It's refreshing to browse
at Kepler's Bookstore without worrying about
finals. It's refreshing to have time for a
smoothie at the Plantation Cafe.
Why do so many Stanford students choose
to live on or near campus over the summer,
especially if they are not taking classes? To the
casual visitor, the campus appears deserted
during the summer months; dorms arc closed.

post office lines are short and bicycle traffic is
virtually non-existent.
In fact, between July and September ap
proximately 450 students remain on campus
and perhaps an equal 'number live in the
nearby off-campus area, according to figures
supplied by the Housing Center and the
various student living groups. Of those, 388
students are registered for the summer quarter,
leaving about the same number who are not.
I he non-students fall into two categories:
the majority, which arranged well in advance
to have jobs cither on campus or nearby, and
the fringe, which found temporary employ
ment as the need arose. All agreed on two
points: that the jobs and wages in this area are

better than those at home and that they are
loathe to give up their independence.
Because Brown is leaving the country at the
end of July, he plans to stay on campus until
that time, and has arranged a data entry job at
the National Youth Law Center on campus.
He also wants first-hand knowledge: "Stanford
during the year and Stanford during the sum
mer are two different worlds; (the summer)
gives me a chance to explore the area.''
Pat/man, on the other hand, decided to stay
because "if you had the jobs I had last sum
mer, you'd stay too." One of these jobs was
working as a waiter and meat carver on some
"overpriced dinner cruises that go up and
down the Missouri River." Figuring that such

jobs were not his bailiwick, he took the posi
tion of news editor at The Daily and is becom
ing involved with the Martin Luther King jr.
papers project.
The find-job-later phenomenon seems to be
primarily a condition of juniors, especially if
they had gone home the summer after their
freshman year only to find jobs there unsatisfy
ing. The phenomenon also occurs with
seniors who have just graduated.
"My life is in limbo," said recent graduate
and Coffee House worker Rob Martinez. "1
basically hung around because I had no idea
what I was going to do over the summer. I'd
