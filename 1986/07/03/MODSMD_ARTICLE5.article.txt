# Bus study looks for subjects

### MORRIE RATNER 
Faculty and staff who commute to Stanford from
Mountain View, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara can partic
ipate in a study to determine ways to improve Santa
Clara County transit service, according to a county tran
sit official.
Don Freeman and Associates, a consulting firm, will
compile a report for Santa Clara County Transit detail
ing the opinions expressed by commuters in two study
groups, which are tentatively scheduled to meet July 16,
said Barrow Emerson, a County Transit analyst.
T he study groups will give transit analysts the oppor
tunity to garner general impressions of its service and the
areas that need improvement, Emerson said. In addi
tion, researchers will be able to "bounce ideas off riders
and potential riders." Participants' suggestions are
worked into County Transit's long-range planning.
Count)' Transit is also using the groups to test con
sumer desire for and reaction to a new express bus along
the El Camino route, Emerson said. Bonus Bus Route
300, scheduled to begin service July 7 from East San
Jose to the University, will have fewer stops and take up
to half an hour less than the current line.
The study groups are "mainly idea-gathering sessions
to find out why people don't ride and why people who
do ride don't like it," said Tom Auer, a University
Transportation Program intern.
"Basically, Santa Clara County Transit wants Stanford
people to ride the bus," Auer said.
He said he will submit a list to the consulting firm of
approximately 10 potential study group participants
from faculty and staff who inform him that they are will
ing to volunteer. The Transportation Program is involved
in the study because "it is the job of the program to
facilitate transportation for people who live and work on
campus."
There will be two groups of about 10 people, Emer
son said, including transit users, non-users and former

users. Participants will be cfiosen from four different
local employers: Syntex Corporation, Xerox Corpora
tion, Alza Corporation and the University.
"We're looking for the typical nine-to-five com
muter,'' he said. Volunteers must live in the appropriate
zip code areas in Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Santa
Clara on the El Camino corridor currently serviced by
County Transit Line 22.
Dennis Perkinson, Stanford Transportation Program
manager, said "the researchers are looking at Stanford as
an employer, and probably do not see students as basic
riders." A relatively small number of Stanford students
use the transit system to commute, and the Transporta
tion Program plans to try to increase ridership next year.
The upcoming study, costing approximately $2,000,
is an extension of a larger project done over a year ago,
Emerson said. After completing a study group project
involving commuters who live over 20 miles away from
the Palo Alto business area, "we thought it would be
useful to follow up with a study of shorter distance com
muters." Approximately 20,000 people use the El
Camino transit route daily.
Don Freeman, from Don Freeman and Associates,
said the project is part of County Transit's ongoing im
provement process, which includes on-bus ridership
surveys and study groups like the one slated for July 16.
County Transit officials take such studies seriously be
cause they want to increase ridership, he said.
Freeman said his consulting firm will finish compil
ing its report on the groups by early August, although
the informal setup of the study groups makes a quan
titative analysis ot commuter desires impossible. A copy
of the report will be sent to Perkinson at the Univeristy
Transportation Program.
Faculty, staff and students interested in volunteering
for a study group should contact Tom Auer at 723-9362.
Participants will receive a $25 honorarium, and each
session will last approximately one-and-a-half hours.
