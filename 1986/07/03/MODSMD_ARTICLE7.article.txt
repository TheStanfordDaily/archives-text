Court backs civil rights view
WASHING I ON — The U.S. Supreme Court
reaffirmed race-conscious hiring and promotional
preferences yesterday, parting company with Reagan
Administration officials who insist that personnel
decisions generally must be made on a colorblind
basis.
The court's rulings in two disputes, one by a 6-3
margin and the other by a 5-4 vote, represented a
major victory for civil rights groups and women's or
ganizations, which have pushed affirmative action
programs in recent years.
At the NAACP conversion in Baltimore, Execu
tive Director Benjamin Hooks hailed the rulings as "a
tremendous victory'' and "a significant rebuke'' to the
Administration.
But at the justice Department, Attorney General
Edwin Meese said he wasn't disheartened.
"We will continue to hold to the moral position
that the court itself in each of these cases has re
established as the ultimate goal that we would have a
colorblind society and that we would not have racial
preferences," he said. "That is the preferred position
of this Administration and the one we will continue
to urge.''
The Supreme Court rejected the Administration's
argument that affirmative action should be limited to
actual victims of past bias to avoid "reverse discrimi
nation" against the innocent, primarily white people.
Liberty party leaves out some
NEW YORK — New York Harbor, a gateway for
generations of immigrants, is ready to salute Lady
Liberty, whose towering beacon will be relit today to
set off an exuberant four-day birthday bash as colossal
as the statue itself.
Millions of visitors, drawn by the once-in-a
lifetime event, were gathering in the city as the har
bor came alive yesterday with graceful tall ships, im
posing naval vessels and small pleasure craft.
The harbor will be the center of attention during
the four-day celebration featuring fireworks, street

fairs and a parade of tall ships. But the statue will be
the star attraction as presidents and tourists gather to
celebrate the monument's centennial.
Tonight, the statue will be bathed in light at a
ceremonial unveiling after a $66 million restoration
project, and Lady Liberty's new torch will be lit.
But in the shadow of the statue, in Battery Park
City, about 50 of the city's homeless spent yesterday
in soggy cardboard boxes to draw attention to their
plight.
They were joined by Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said
they were being excluded from the celebration,
where tickets to the opening ceremonies featuring
President Reagan and President Francois Mitterand
of France go for $10,000.
NASA to redesign boosters
WASHINGTON — NASA engineers released
plans yesterday to redesign six key parts of the space
shuttle's ill-fated solid rocket boosters, including the
flawed joint that caused January's Challenger disaster
and two seals that posed "serious" hazards on earlier
shuttle flights.
The final blueprints, to be drawn up later this
summer, also may substitute the rubbery O-rings
cited in the Challenger accident for rings made of
metal or some other material, officials said.
"In all cases it will be a redundant system, a fully
redundant system," John Thomas, a NASA engineer
in charge of the redesign project, said.
The Challenger disaster occurred 73 seconds after
its Jan. 28 launch, killing all seven of its crew when a
faulty joint in the right rocket booster allowed hot
gases to escape and sear through an adjacent tank of
explosive hydrogen.
The redesign proposals were drafted by experts
from NASA and Morton Thiokol Inc., manufacturer
of the solid rocket booster. They stem from en
gineering reviews of the fatal joint and other points
in the booster where similar gas leaks were believed
possible.
The first full-scale tests of the redesigned boosters
will not occur until November or December. -
