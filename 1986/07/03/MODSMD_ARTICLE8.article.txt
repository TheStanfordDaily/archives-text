Pinochet rule sparks massive strike
SANTIAGO — Reacting sharply to a national strike, Chile's mili
tary regime yesterday censored opposition radio stations and charged
strike leaders with promoting disorder in their demand for a return to
democracy.
At least three persons, including a 13-year-old girl, were shot and
killed in army-patrolled slums around the capital, where residents bar
ricaded streets with burning tires last night and littered highways with
twisted nails to stop traffic.
Union leaders here estimated that 85 percent of the city's 9,000
buses and the majority of Chile's 60,000 trucks stopped yesterday.
About half of Santiago's 250,000 shop workers stayed home, spokes
men for their union said.
Strike leaders called it a successful first round in their battle to drive
Gen. Augusto Pinochet from the presidency he seized in a bloody mil
itary coup in September 1973.
Pretoria to prosecute 780 detainees
JOHANNESBURG — South African authorities announced yes
terday that they intend to file criminal charges against 780 of the esti
mated 4,000 people, most of them black, who have been detained un
der the three-week-old state of emergency.
The announcement was greeted with skepticism by civil rights
lawyers, who said they suspected the formal charges were a way to im
mobilize key black political leaders by tying them up in complicated
court cases which might drag on for months.
