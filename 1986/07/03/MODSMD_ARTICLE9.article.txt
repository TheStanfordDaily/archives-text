The beleaguered white minority government in South Africa may
be desperate, but it is not stupid.
Faced with mounting violence at home and growing condemnation
abroad, South Africa's white minority government has taken shrewd
steps in recent weeks to conceal its sordid internal problems from the
rest of the world.
Sweeping press restrictions, imposed June 12 as part of a compre
hensive Emergency Decree, have had a devastating effect on the
freedom and accuracy of press reports coming out of South Africa.
While government manipulation of press freedom, particularly in
times of national unrest, is certainly nothing new, Pretoria's most
recent restrictions have added a new and particularly crippling twist to
the practice of censorship.
What makes South Africa's recent clampdown so devastating is that
it forces journalists to muzzle themselves. The government has an
nounced no specific press guidelines. Rather, officials have stated
simply that South Africa will expel any journalist found to have trans
mitted "subversive statements."
Under the new restrictions, journalists can never be sure what the
government will deem "subversive." Hence, reporters wishing to
avoid deportation must now censor their own work according to what
they think the South African government wants to hear.
The new censorship in South Africa presents the foreign press in
that country with a dilemma which strikes at the very essencc of jour
nalism and social responsibility: publish the truth and be silenced, or
obey the censors, swallow its pride and print what it can to keep the
world at least somewhat aware of South African atrocities.
) We can only hope that the press perseveres and remains in the
country for as long as possible. Because without it, we will know noth
ing about the conditions in that country, and through lack of knowl
edge, the world could too easily forget the struggles of the oppressed
black majority of South Africa.
