Court to hear local case
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yester
day voted to hear the appeal of a man denied promo
tion to a job as a road dispatcher by Santa Clara
County.
Paul Johnson was denied the promotion in Cali
fornia in 1980. The job instead went to Diane Joyce.
Both had considerable experience working as road
yard clerks with the county's transportation agency.
The court last week strongly reaffirmed the con
cept of affirmative action in employment by uphold
ing a plan for Cleveland's fire department and a court
consent decree aimed at increasing the number of
minorities in a New York City area labor union.
But the justices left unanswered the question of
whether public employers violate the Constitution's
equal-protection guarantees when giving special
preferences in employment. By hearing the case,
they have agreed to decide whether such employers
may promote a woman over a more qualified man to
help get women into higher ranking jobs.
Johnson said he was more qualified because he
scored two points higher than Joyce on an oral ex
amination for the dispatcher job. The examiners who
conducted the test unanimously recommended
Johnson for the promotion.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1984
overturned a federal judge's ruling and ordered that
Joyce get the job.
The appeals court said the affirmative action plan
is constitutional because it is aimed at breaking down
a long-standing imbalance between men and women
in the county agency's workforce.
Court spikes Vulgarity'
WASHINGTON — Saying public schools have a
duty to teach "the habits and manners of civility," the
Supreme Court yesterday gave school administrators
nationwide broad disciplinary powers that include
suspending students who use vulgar language.
By a 7-2 vote, the court upheld the 1983 suspen
sion of a Spanaway, Wash., high school senior for
giving an assembly speech filled with sexual allu
sions.
Matthew Fraser's one-minute speech in support of
a friend's candidacy for student body vice president of
Bethel High School contained no obscene words, but
it caused a brief uproar among his fellow students.
In the speech, Fraser described his friend as "a
man who is firm — he's firm in his pants . . . his
character is firm ... a man who will go to the very
end, even the climax, for each and every one of

ff
you.
Officials at the school in suburban Tacoma
suspended Fraser for three days for violating a school
rule banning disruptive conduct. Now a student at
the UC-Berkeley, Fraser sued school officials. He
was forced to miss two days of school before his
suspension was lifted.
A federal judge, upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, ruled that Bethel High officials had
violated Fraser's free-speech rights by disciplining
him. School officials were ordered to pay Fraser $278
in damages and $12,750 in legal costs.
Bank blood is AIDS-suspect
WASHINGTON — Despite recent efforts to
screen blood donations for the AIDS virus, a small
percentage of blood at banks throughout the country
remains contaminated with the AIDS virus, re
searchers at the National Institutes of Health reported
yesterday.
Tests used to protect the nation's blood supply
against AIDS are failing to detect a tiny, but signifi
cant, number of infected blood donors in the earliest
months of infection, said scientists at a consensus
conference on screening blood for AIDS held at the
NIH in Bethesda, Md.
University of Pennsylvania health economists,
Drs. J. Sanford Schwartz and Bruce Kinosian, esti
mated that approximately one in 100,000 blood
donors are in the earliest stages of infection with the
AIDS virus. This would equal about 80 such blood
donors out of the 8 million Americans who give
blood annually.
Some of the available tests would catch most of
these 80 donors while some of the most widely used
tests would miss many of them.
Man runs amok on ferry
NEW YORK - A homeless man armed with a
two-foot sword randomly stabbed and slashed pas
sengers aboard a Staten Island ferry during rush hour
yesterday morning, leaving two dead and nine
injured.
Juan Gonzalez, 43, described as a homeless man
and a Cuban refugee, began his attack aboard the
Samuel I. Newhouse ferry about 5:35 a.m. as it
passed the Statue of Liberty, according to Richard
Condon, acting police commissioner.
Gonzalez was finally stopped by a retired police
detective who held him at gunpoint until the ferry
docked, Condon said.

suspending students who use vulgar language.
By a 7-2 vote, the court upheld the 1983 suspen
sion of a Spanaway, Wash., high school senior for
giving an assembly speech filled with sexual allu
sions.
Matthew Fraser's one-minute speech in support of
a friend's candidacy for student body vice president of
Bethel High School contained no obscene words, but
it caused a brief uproar among his fellow students.
In the speech, Fraser described his friend as "a
man who is firm — he's firm in his pants . . . his
character is firm ... a man who will go to the very
end, even the climax, for each and every one of

ff
you.
Officials at the school in suburban Tacoma
suspended Fraser for three days for violating a school
rule banning disruptive conduct. Now a student at
the UC-Berkeley, Fraser sued school officials. He
was forced to miss two days of school before his
suspension was lifted.
A federal judge, upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, ruled that Bethel High officials had
violated Fraser's free-speech rights by disciplining
him. School officials were ordered to pay Fraser $278
in damages and $12,750 in legal costs.
Bank blood is AIDS-suspect
WASHINGTON — Despite recent efforts to
screen blood donations for the AIDS virus, a small
percentage of blood at banks throughout the country
remains contaminated with the AIDS virus, re
searchers at the National Institutes of Health reported
yesterday.
Tests used to protect the nation's blood supply
against AIDS are failing to detect a tiny, but signifi
cant, number of infected blood donors in the earliest
months of infection, said scientists at a consensus
conference on screening blood for AIDS held at the
NIH in Bethesda, Md.
University of Pennsylvania health economists,
Drs. J. Sanford Schwartz and Bruce Kinosian, esti
mated that approximately one in 100,000 blood
donors are in the earliest stages of infection with the
AIDS virus. This would equal about 80 such blood
donors out of the 8 million Americans who give
blood annually.
Some of the available tests would catch most of
these 80 donors while some of the most widely used
tests would miss many of them.
Man runs amok on ferry
NEW YORK - A homeless man armed with a
two-foot sword randomly stabbed and slashed pas
sengers aboard a Staten Island ferry during rush hour
yesterday morning, leaving two dead and nine
injured.
Juan Gonzalez, 43, described as a homeless man
and a Cuban refugee, began his attack aboard the
Samuel I. Newhouse ferry about 5:35 a.m. as it
passed the Statue of Liberty, according to Richard
Condon, acting police commissioner.
Gonzalez was finally stopped by a retired police
detective who held him at gunpoint until the ferry
docked, Condon said.
