Pro-Marcos revolt collapses
MANILA — A political challenge to President Corazon Aquino by
an ally of former president Ferdinand Marcos collapsed yesterday as
supporters of Arturo Tolentino, under pressure from a government
deadline, left a luxury hotel they had taken over Sunday.
About half a dozen serving and former generals who were among
those who supported Tolentino in seizing the Manila Hotel left
through the back door last night, Reuters reported.
Although political and diplomatic analysts here and in Washington
played down the seriousness of the incident, they said it underscored
the need for Aquino to settle the immediate political problems facing
her government, such as the drafting of a new constitution and re
scheduling local elections, to remove any doubt about her govern
ment's legitimacy.
In Washington, the Reagan Administration rebuked Marcos in the
sharpest terms it has used since Marcos was deposed in February and
warned that Marcos' political activity "is inconsistent with his status as
a guest in the United States." White House and State Department of
ficials also said they did not know whether Marcos had incited the
rebellion. Pending further investigation, they said the Administration
does not intend to renege on Reagan's pledge of refuge for Marcos or
oust him from his exile in Hawaii.
Japan's Liberal party gets big win
TOKYO — The governing Liberal Democrats won Japan's biggest
postwar election victory, increasing chances that party rules will be
changed so Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone can stay in office
beyond October.
The vote was seen as a mandate for Nakasone's pro-Western
policies and his plans for domestic economic change.
Election boards in the 47 states said after counting the ballots cast
Sunday that government party candidates won 300 of the 512 seats in
the powerful House of Representatives.
The Japan Socialist Party, the main opposition, lost 24 seats for an
all-time low of 86, and the centrist Democratic Socialist Party dropped
to 26 seats from 37. Other parties generally stayed even.
