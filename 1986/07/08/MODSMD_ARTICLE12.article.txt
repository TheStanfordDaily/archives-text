## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Sex ruling flawed 
### 
The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last week allowing states to prose
cute homosexuals for sodomy is based neither on precedent nor on
constitutional principles, but rather on a mistaken notion of morality.
The case involved a challenge to the Georgia sodomy law, which
prohibits "any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and
the mouth or anus of another" and imposes a sentence of up to 20
years imprisonment for a conviction. The case was brought by an At
lanta man who was arrested in 1982 when a police officer serving a
traffic warrant saw him engaging in a homosexual act in his bedroom.
The charges were later dropped, but the man challenged the law on
the grounds that it violated his constitutional right to privacy.
Writing for the 5-4 majority, Associate Justice Byron White cited
the "ancient roots" of laws against sodomy as the basis of the court's
ruling: "Sodomy was a criminal offense at common law and was for
bidden by the laws of the original 13 states when they ratified the Bill
of Rights. ... In fact, until 1961, all 50 states outlawed sodomy, and
today, 24 states and the District of Columbia continue to provide
criminal penalties for sodomy."
But slavery, too, has ancient roots. It was permitted in the original
13 states when they ratified the Bill of Rights, and until 1961, many
states still maintained poll taxes, "separate but equal" facilities and
prohibited interracial marriage.
Couldn't the majority have come up with better reasoning than the
founding fathers' dislike of sodomy?
Rather than consider 200-year-old laws as gospel, the justices
should have followed the precedent of the past six decades, a period
that has seen a positive expansion of the concept of privacy rights.
In the past 60 years, the high court has extended this so-called
"zone of privacy" to include the right to choose whom to marry, the
right to conceive a child, the right to carry a pregnancy to term, and
the right to educate a child as a parent sees fit. Such rights are funda
mental to all Americans, not just to heterosexuals. Yet the majority
refused to extend such rights to gays and lesbians, saying there is "no
connection between family, marriage or procreation on the one hand
and homosexual activity on the other
But precedent aside, the most offensive aspect of the decision was
the justices' refusal to address the issue of heterosexual sodomy.
Saying it would not rule on whether the same law applied to
heterosexuals, the court simply ducked the issue. This is blatant dis
crimination against homosexuals.
Last week's ruling not only dealt a heavy blow to gay rights groups,
but also marked a setback for the civil rights of all Americans. By al
lowing the government to enter the bedrooms of consenting adults,
the Supreme Court's decision sets a dangerous precedent for future
decisions that could place the government in the role of Big Brother.
