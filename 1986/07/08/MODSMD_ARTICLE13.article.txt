Sodomy article
insensitive
The Daily has once again demon
strated insensitivity to the gay com
munity in its coverage of "Farm
reacts to sodomy ruling" (July 3).
The article approaches the ruling
from the gay rights perspective, but
includes only one seven-word quote
from a gay rights person. Two stu
dents are quoted extensively, osten
sibly to show the spectrum of stu
dent opinion, but the comments
from Kirk Cameron can hardly be
called representative.
Cameron's suggestion that "the
ruling doesn't restrict rights of
privacy, but rather limits privileges
of privacy," is a distinction worthy of
Joe McCarthy and John Birch. His
belief that anti-sodomy laws are "an
effective way to curb the spread of
AIDS" is derived from the same
faulty reasoning that led us to
believe that segregation was the best
way to curb racial tension in the
South and that imprisonment of
Asian Americans was the best way to
prevent foreign espionage during
World War 11. Americans have
decided that the ends do not justify
the means when it comes to denying
personal liberty.
The suggestion that anti-sodomy
laws will prevent AIDS is an insult
to the concerned Americans who are
genuinely working to stop the spread
of the disease. The supporters of
anti-sodomy laws are the same

people who called AIDS "God's
punishment against gays" and who
have called for the mandatory
quarantine of AIDS victims. The
local and national press have
ignored this ludicrous suggestion,
but The Daily has given it
prominence.
The reporter has totally botched
this article. She doesn't seem to
realize that the ruling has implica
tions for straights as well as gays, and
within the gay rights context, she
demonstrates complete ignorance of
gay people.
This ruling will probably impact
the lives of lesbians and gays for the
next decade, but she doesn't see fit
to find out our opinion of the ruling.
She instead asks some straight
people how they think this will im
pact gays, and has the audacity to
report a bigotted opinion as repre
sentative of Stanford's response. The
reporter apparently can't even bring
herself to use the word "gay,"
making such grating references as
"homosexual rights," which is about
as appropriate as "Negro rights."
I understand that student
reporters have limited time to
prepare articles, but shoddy jour
nalism like this does more harm
than good. In the future, if you can't
get it right, don't say anything at all.
