Sodomy article
insensitive
The Daily has once again demon
strated insensitivity to the gay com
munity in its coverage of "Farm
reacts to sodomy ruling" (July 3).
The article approaches the ruling
from the gay rights perspective, but
includes only one seven-word quote
from a gay rights person. Two stu
dents are quoted extensively, osten
sibly to show the spectrum of stu
dent opinion, but the comments
from Kirk Cameron can hardly be
called representative.
Cameron's suggestion that "the
ruling doesn't restrict rights of
privacy, but rather limits privileges
of privacy," is a distinction worthy of
Joe McCarthy and John Birch. His
belief that anti-sodomy laws are "an
effective way to curb the spread of
AIDS" is derived from the same
faulty reasoning that led us to
believe that segregation was the best
way to curb racial tension in the
South and that imprisonment of
Asian Americans was the best way to
prevent foreign espionage during
World War 11. Americans have
decided that the ends do not justify
the means when it comes to denying
personal liberty.
The suggestion that anti-sodomy
laws will prevent AIDS is an insult
to the concerned Americans who are
genuinely working to stop the spread
of the disease. The supporters of
anti-sodomy laws are the same

people who called AIDS "God's
punishment against gays" and who
have called for the mandatory
quarantine of AIDS victims. The
local and national press have
ignored this ludicrous suggestion,
but The Daily has given it
prominence.
The reporter has totally botched
this article. She doesn't seem to
realize that the ruling has implica
tions for straights as well as gays, and
within the gay rights context, she
demonstrates complete ignorance of
gay people.
This ruling will probably impact
the lives of lesbians and gays for the
next decade, but she doesn't see fit
to find out our opinion of the ruling.
She instead asks some straight
people how they think this will im
pact gays, and has the audacity to
report a bigotted opinion as repre
sentative of Stanford's response. The
reporter apparently can't even bring
herself to use the word "gay,"
making such grating references as
"homosexual rights," which is about
as appropriate as "Negro rights."
I understand that student
reporters have limited time to
prepare articles, but shoddy jour
nalism like this does more harm
than good. In the future, if you can't
get it right, don't say anything at all.

Cowell does care
about its patients
As a member of the Cowell staff I
was very interested in the article that
was printed about the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center and concerned
that the two students mentioned had
such negative experiences while
being treated here.
Cowell is not perfect (neither is
any other health institution), but I
wanted the student population to
know that there are staff members
here who are competent, caring and
sensitive, and take a great deal of in
terest and time in student activities
and feedback.
I am not making excuses for the
way they were treated. If a staff
member was rude or insensitive,
that is an intolerable and unaccepta
ble situation. However, I may be
able to shed a bit of light from a
medical point of view.
The student who had a cut on his
head stated that he had to fill out a
form first. I am unaware of any
forms except a paper asking for
name, age, address and student I.D.
number.
From a medical standpoint this is
extremely important. What would
happen if we started to treat a patient
and their medical condition sud
denly deteriorated and perhaps they
lost consciousness? We need to be
able to tell the paramedics and the
emergency room who the patient is.
Also, while one person is treating
a patient, another person is getting
their chart so we can check for any
pre-existing medical conditions
which might affect their care. Ex
amples of such things might be:
neurological disease, blood
dyscrasia, tetanus shot status, etc.

Concerning the patient with the
sprained ankle, I realize how she
feels. In cases such as sprains,
strains, tendon inflammation or
muscular back pain, the symptoms
can also last a long time. 1 hat s
frustrating and depressing. And it's
equally frustrating for a health
provider since we are limited with
what we can do. There is no set cure
and the most we can offer is
symptomatic pain relief, physical
therapy and reassurance that the
healing time is normal. But we can't
do anything if we aren't approached
and made aware that someone is
walking around campus with a prob
lem.
Again, let me say that there is no
excuse for staff rudeness and I wish
these two students had pursued the
issue immediately so we could have
done something to rectify the situa
tion at the time it happened.
I hope that students will take the
time to come by Cowell and check
out the various services that are of
fered. We have a Health Promotion
Program, Women's Care Group,
Non-Smoking Group, and Counsel
ing and Psychological Services, to
name a few.
Also of interest will be a group
forming in the fall. Student Health
Advisory Review/Evaluation
(SHARE) will be an advisory com
mittee consisting of students and
one Cowell staff member as a
liaison. Anyone interested in inter
viewing for a SHARE position can
phone me at 723-4841 between the
hours of 2-4 p.m. (Monday through

I hope for a good response to
SHARE. Student participation can
help us to provide better care and
help us to help you, the student.

terest and time in student activities
and feedback.
I am not making excuses for the
way they were treated. If a staff
member was rude or insensitive,
that is an intolerable and unaccepta
ble situation. However, I may be
able to shed a bit of light from a
medical point of view.
The student who had a cut on his
head stated that he had to fill out a
form first. I am unaware of any
forms except a paper asking for
name, age, address and student I.D.
number.
From a medical standpoint this is
extremely important. What would
happen if we started to treat a patient
and their medical condition sud
denly deteriorated and perhaps they
lost consciousness? We need to be
able to tell the paramedics and the
emergency room who the patient is.
Also, while one person is treating
a patient, another person is getting
their chart so we can check for any
pre-existing medical conditions
which might affect their care. Ex
amples of such things might be:
neurological disease, blood
dyscrasia, tetanus shot status, etc.

Concerning the patient with the
sprained ankle, I realize how she
feels. In cases such as sprains,
strains, tendon inflammation or
muscular back pain, the symptoms
can also last a long time. 1 hat s
frustrating and depressing. And it's
equally frustrating for a health
provider since we are limited with
what we can do. There is no set cure
and the most we can offer is
symptomatic pain relief, physical
therapy and reassurance that the
healing time is normal. But we can't
do anything if we aren't approached
and made aware that someone is
walking around campus with a prob
lem.
Again, let me say that there is no
excuse for staff rudeness and I wish
these two students had pursued the
issue immediately so we could have
done something to rectify the situa
tion at the time it happened.
I hope that students will take the
time to come by Cowell and check
out the various services that are of
fered. We have a Health Promotion
Program, Women's Care Group,
Non-Smoking Group, and Counsel
ing and Psychological Services, to
name a few.
Also of interest will be a group
forming in the fall. Student Health
Advisory Review/Evaluation
(SHARE) will be an advisory com
mittee consisting of students and
one Cowell staff member as a
liaison. Anyone interested in inter
viewing for a SHARE position can
phone me at 723-4841 between the
hours of 2-4 p.m. (Monday through
Friday).
I hope for a good response to
SHARE. Student participation can
help us to provide better care and
help us to help you, the student.

Sodomy article
insensitive
The Daily has once again demon
strated insensitivity to the gay com
munity in its coverage of "Farm
reacts to sodomy ruling" (July 3).
The article approaches the ruling
from the gay rights perspective, but
includes only one seven-word quote
from a gay rights person. Two stu
dents are quoted extensively, osten
sibly to show the spectrum of stu
dent opinion, but the comments
from Kirk Cameron can hardly be
called representative.
Cameron's suggestion that "the
ruling doesn't restrict rights of
privacy, but rather limits privileges
of privacy," is a distinction worthy of
Joe McCarthy and John Birch. His
belief that anti-sodomy laws are "an
effective way to curb the spread of
AIDS" is derived from the same
faulty reasoning that led us to
believe that segregation was the best
way to curb racial tension in the
South and that imprisonment of
Asian Americans was the best way to
prevent foreign espionage during
World War 11. Americans have
decided that the ends do not justify
the means when it comes to denying
personal liberty.
The suggestion that anti-sodomy
laws will prevent AIDS is an insult
to the concerned Americans who are
genuinely working to stop the spread
of the disease. The supporters of
anti-sodomy laws are the same

people who called AIDS "God's
punishment against gays" and who
have called for the mandatory
quarantine of AIDS victims. The
local and national press have
ignored this ludicrous suggestion,
but The Daily has given it
prominence.
The reporter has totally botched
this article. She doesn't seem to
realize that the ruling has implica
tions for straights as well as gays, and
within the gay rights context, she
demonstrates complete ignorance of
gay people.
This ruling will probably impact
the lives of lesbians and gays for the
next decade, but she doesn't see fit
to find out our opinion of the ruling.
She instead asks some straight
people how they think this will im
pact gays, and has the audacity to
report a bigotted opinion as repre
sentative of Stanford's response. The
reporter apparently can't even bring
herself to use the word "gay,"
making such grating references as
"homosexual rights," which is about
as appropriate as "Negro rights."
I understand that student
reporters have limited time to
prepare articles, but shoddy jour
nalism like this does more harm
than good. In the future, if you can't
get it right, don't say anything at all.

Cowell does care

As a member of the Cowell staff I
was very interested in the article that
was printed about the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center and concerned
that the two students mentioned had
such negative experiences while
being treated here.
Cowell is not perfect (neither is
any other health institution), but I
wanted the student population to
know that there are staff members
here who are competent, caring and
sensitive, and take a great deal of in
terest and time in student activities
