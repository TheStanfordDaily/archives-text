# If I were dictator for a day
## 
### 
Well, my mind is made up. I'm running for dictator.
Yes, I've stood by long enough idly watching my fel
low man dig himself a hole and jump in it, soiling his
best suit. My platform is simple and straightforward, al
though also complex and elusive. Here's where I sit on a
few of the issues:
Leadership: Me, as dictator. Anything else is too inef
ficient, although the tradition of British royalty agrees
with me in the manner of custom and protocol.

("America has never had a queen," I once sadly
remarked to a British friend. "What about Warren Har
ding?" he asked.)
Unemployment: My being dictator will ensure a step
forward in reducing unemployment, since I currently
don't have a job.
Military Spending: Right now the two superpowers
have the capability to blow up the world 5,000 times.
This is totally inadequate. 1 think it would be neat if we
built up an arsenal which, if triggered, could wipe out
out entire solar system. Boom! Ha ha.
TTie Space Program: Any idiot who has watched "Star
Trek" knows that the Enterprise is far superior to any
thing NASA has yet developed. Why can't we raise
some money toward the development of warp drive?
Those guys hop around from galaxy to galaxy, while for
us just getting to the moon is a big deal. I mean come
on.
Apartheid: It will quickly end after specialists train
world diplomats to humiliate the South African govern-

ment through employing not only economic sanctions
but verbal sarcasm as well. (Example — Botha to West
ern diplomat: "We have a plan to end apartheid
gradually over a period of time.'' Diplomat: "Oh yeah,
I'll just bet you do.")
T. V. Entertainment: Johnny Carson will be forced to
retire (formally). All precocious children from situation
comedies will be hanged by the neck until they promise
to leave show business. Game shows will remain,
watched on closed circuit television by convicted mur
derers in lieu of the death penalty.
Sports: Baseball games, which currently consist of
two minutes of action squeezed into four hours of play,
would be shortened to three innings, and, to enhance
entertainment, would be played by dwarfs. Darts, which
can be played holding a beer, will become an official
Olympic sport.
As a dictator with a recently completed liberal arts
education, I will of course devote much time toward the
exploration of philosophical paradoxes that have
plagued man since his first independent thought. For
instance, hasn't anyone ever wondered why all our fa
mous men were born on holidays? How life evolved on
our planet? How the Hoover Institution apparently
avoids being a "political entity?"
No one likes to pay income taxes. Therefore, 110 one
will. The United States is so far in debt already that if we
need money we'll just borrow some more. I can't believe
no one thought of this before.
The speed limit 011 national highways will be raised
from 55 to 65 miles per hour. However, the public will
not be informed of this. They will continue to drive at
65, thinking the limit is 10 miles per hour less, and no
one will get speeding tickets.
That's about all I can think of right now. Of course I
reserve the right to change my mind at any time. I think
I already have. So please, vote for me.
Or maybe you, too, are planning to run for dictator?
