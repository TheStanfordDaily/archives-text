# VIEWPOINT
## Neither side right in Nicaragua 
### 
It has been common in years past for the American
left not only to attack the U.S. government for interven
tion in other countries but also to hold up the policies of
the governments of those countries as exemplary.
I returned last week from Nicaragua, having worked
as a visiting surgeon in both university and rural hospi
tals. On the positive side, I found that the polio vaccina
tion campaign had been successful, even according to
many critics of the government. The Sandinistas had
built new rural hospitals capable of handling common
medical and surgical problems. I was able to repair a
farmworker's hand injury in a small hospital in Masaya.

On the other hand, two teaching hospitals I visited
were dirty and had equipment such as basic X-rays or
operating room suction and lights that broke down fre
quently. No lecture or operation in which I was in
volved at Fonseca Hospital in Managua began on time,
and the number of elective surgical cases in the univer
sity hospital in Leon had been reduced to one-sixth the
number done earlier in the year. None of the ventilators
for adults or children were working. Glucose determina
tions were no longer available from the lab.
I asked a surgical resident, "How much of your prob
lem is due to the U.S. embargo and to the contra war?"
He took me aside and changed from Spanish to En
glish because "the walls have ears."
"We don't like Reagan," he said,"but we also don't
like the Sandinistas."
He and others with whom I spoke had criticisms of
the Sandinista government's economic and political ac
tions. While in the markets and while waiting for trans
portation I met people with different backgrounds, some
who supported the government, many who opposed it.
No one to whom I spoke felt his or her lot was now bet
ter than before the revolution.
Farmers must sell their produce directly to the gov
ernment at prices one-third to one-fourth that of the
market price. For this reason, there are shortages in
beans, rice, potatoes, milk and meat. The U.S. govern
ment does not compel the Sandinistas to force these
prices on the farmers.
The government then stores the produce, often
poorly. During my two weeks in Nicaragua, the
newspapers were allowed to report the loss of 200,000

pounds of meat to spoilage, and the loss of 200,000
chickens by the government.
Nicaraguans receive ration cards entitling them to set
amounts of beans, rice, and other basic foods. T hey wait
hours in line for the foods to find they will not receive
what their cards say they should.
Inflation was 219 percent last year â€” one of the worst
rates in Latin America. Between 1979 and 1986, the ex
change rates for the Nicaraguan cordoba went from
seven to a dollar to 950 to a dollar officially. (The dollar
will buy 2,000 cordobas on the black market.) The price
for a dozen eggs has risen from 3. 5 cordobas to 280
cordobas in the past seven years. Again, Reagan has not
forced the Sandinistas to increase the number of circu
lating cordobas from 3 million to 186 million during
their time in power.
With inflation and shortages such as these, morale is
low in the hospital and in the society at large. Things do
not get fixed. There is no incentive to save, invest or to
make improvements, as can be seen in the empty and
dilapidated shops of Managua. Inpatient care is free in
the public hospitals, but if a patient has a bladder infec
tion, antibiotics may be unobtainable because of infla
tion or scarcity.
Health rights workers have condemned torture in
Chile and mass murders in El Salvador. They should
turn their attention to Nicaragua as well. Amnesty Inter
national and Nicaragua's Permanent Commission on
Human Rights have documented political imprison
ment of thousands in Nicaragua. How much of this can
be explained by the country's state of siege?
That question may be argued, but torture of political
prisoners can never be justified. Prisoners in Nicaraguan
jails have been kept without light for weeks, beaten,
sexually assaulted, and denied food and water as part of
long interrogations.
None of the observations justifies aid to the contras
who are also guilty of numerous war crimes. None jus
tify an embargo. If they did, the U.S. government could
justify an embargo against most Latin American
countries whose governments have caused similar eco
nomic disasters and violations of human rights. Al
though U.S. intervention in Central America should be
opposed, its persistence cannot excuse the mistakes and
crimes of the Nicaraguan government.
