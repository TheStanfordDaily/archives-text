## Bug spotlights Quad, Supreme Court affair 
### KIRK JENSEN JOHN POWELL Staff writers 
Once again, we have spent countless hours of
research and thought, grappling with life's
greatest questions. We hope you agree that these
questions will never again tax the minds of the
wise and the well-read (that's you).
DEAR BUG ME: Near the Office of Manage
ment and Budget in the Quad, way up high in the
rafters, is a number 143 or 144, something like
that. Why? What does it mean? Someone went to
a lot of trouble to post those metal numerals!
— Pain in the neck
DEAR PAIN: We really had no idea what these
numerals represented so we accordingly began
our search for the answer at the Office of Manage
ment and Budget (OMB). Sure enough, near the
wooden ceiling of the arcade (that's the walkway
that surrounds the quadrangle) was the address
type number, 144. Was this figure part of an
outdated numbering system for the quadrangle
buildings? Did it refer to a little-known classroom
on the roof? Perhaps, we thought, because of
its location in front of the OMB, it indicated a se
cret drop point for money from anonymous
donors.
Further investigation of the rest of the quad
rangle revealed that these numbers are present in
most of the arcades, in ascending order, starting at
the archway to the east of Memorial Church.
Clearly, the numbers were part of some organiza
tional system for the entire quadrangle. We con
jectured that these numbers referred to the rela
tive importance of the offices and departments
below them. Surprisingly, this hypothesis made a
lot of sense; God is at number one, University
President Donald Kennedy lies somewhere be
tween 16 and 20, the Philosophy Department ap
pears at 34 and Geology comes close to dead last
at 139.
We contacted the University Archives at Green
Library for a more complete answer. A search of
the architectural drawings for the inner and outer
quadrangles revealed no sign of a numbering sys
tem in the arcades. Roxanne Nilan, curator of the
archives, suggested that the numbers were used to
aid in the reconstruction of the quadrangle after

the earthquake of 1906.
Next, we phoned Bruce Wiggins, associate
director of Operations, Maintenance and
Utilities. Wiggins had no explanation for the
numbering system and indicated that the
numerals are not presently part of a scheme for
servicing the quadrangle.
With no answer in sight, we returned to the
quadrangle for another look. After a few minutes
of staring at the arcade ceilings, and with an
amazing display of logic, we solved the mystery.
Adjacent to every number in the arcade is a light

fixture, though there are some newer fixtures
without numerals. The numbers seemed to be a
way of indicating which light bulbs needed replac
ing. A call back to Wiggins with this information
started some searching in the electrical shops, and
a 1958 plan of the "arcade lighting system" was
found.
Darrel Reynolds, electrician leader for Opera
tions, Maintenance and Utilities, told us that the
numbers do refer to the light fixtures in the
arcade, but the numbers are no longer used. The
light bulbs are now replaced under a scheme
called a "group relight," in which a whole section
of bulbs are replaced.
DEAR BUG ME: Did Sandra Day O'Connor
and William Rehnquist really date at Stanford? If
so, did they do anything that they later voted
against?
— Ronnie
DEAR RON: We are impressed by your inter
est in this very important matter. Amidst all the
controversy surrounding the sacred institution of
the Supreme Court, we're glad someone has fi
nally focused on one of the more pressing issues.
Justice O'Connor and Justice Rehnquist both
were members of the Stanford Law School Class
of 1952. Rehnquist graduated first in the class and
O'Connor graduated third. Newsweek magazine

reports that the late Law School Prof. George Os
borne described the Class of 1952 as the
"dumbest" he had ever taught. So much for Os
borne's observation.
For those Bug Me readers who have not been
keeping up on their current events, the June 30
issue of Newsweek states that O'Connor said she
"sometimes dated Rehnquist at Stanford.
O'Connor explains that in law school Rehnquist
sometimes fixed his Studebaker car with
chewing gum."
We contacted the Newsweek offices in Wash
ington and spoke to Ann McDaniel, the reporter
for the above-mentioned story. She explained that
Newsweek interviewed O'Connor in 1971, when
Rehnquist was appointed to the Supreme Court.
O'Connor, then a legislator in Arizona, told
Newsweek the story about Rehnquist's Studebaker
and said that she had dated him in law school.
To try to add details to Newsweek's report, we
phoned the Supreme Court. We got as far as
O'Connor's chambers and were then referred to
the Supreme Court public relations office. Toni
House, who is in charge of the office, denied
Newsweek's report, saying that the justices
"certainly knew each other, but to the best of our
knowledge they never dated."
In fact, it would seem unlikely, according to
other Newsweek accounts, that the justices would
have had time to date while in school. Sandra
Day met her husband, John Jay O'Connor 111,
while attending law school. According to
Newsweek, the two wrote for the Stanford Law
Review and had dinner the first night they met. It
was the first of 46 straight dates.
Rehnquist also met his spouse, Natalie, at
Stanford, though there are no reports of his dating
records.
For the final word on this dating dispute, we
contacted Connie Hellier, director of News and
Publications at the Law School. She stated that
"nobody here has heard any such rumors" and
conjectured that the gossip may have started due
to the "coincidence of year," since both attended
school here until 1952.
This of course leaves the second part of your
question open for inquiry. Were you referring to
any particular issue that they may have voted
against?

Once again, we have spent countless hours of
research and thought, grappling with life's
greatest questions. We hope you agree that these
questions will never again tax the minds of the
wise and the well-read (that's you).

amazing display of logic, we solved the mystery.
Adjacent to every number in the arcade is a light

fixture, though there are some newer fixtures
without numerals. The numbers seemed to be a
way of indicating which light bulbs needed replac
ing. A call back to Wiggins with this information
started some searching in the electrical shops, and
a 1958 plan of the "arcade lighting system" was
found.
Darrel Reynolds, electrician leader for Opera
tions, Maintenance and Utilities, told us that the
numbers do refer to the light fixtures in the
arcade, but the numbers are no longer used. The
light bulbs are now replaced under a scheme
called a "group relight," in which a whole section
of bulbs are replaced.
DEAR BUG ME: Did Sandra Day O'Connor
and William Rehnquist really date at Stanford? If
so, did they do anything that they later voted
against?
— Ronnie
DEAR RON: We are impressed by your inter
est in this very important matter. Amidst all the
controversy surrounding the sacred institution of
the Supreme Court, we're glad someone has fi
nally focused on one of the more pressing issues.
Justice O'Connor and Justice Rehnquist both
were members of the Stanford Law School Class
of 1952. Rehnquist graduated first in the class and
O'Connor graduated third. Newsweek magazine

reports that the late Law School Prof. George Os
borne described the Class of 1952 as the
"dumbest" he had ever taught. So much for Os
borne's observation.
For those Bug Me readers who have not been
keeping up on their current events, the June 30
issue of Newsweek states that O'Connor said she
"sometimes dated Rehnquist at Stanford.
O'Connor explains that in law school Rehnquist
sometimes fixed his Studebaker car with
chewing gum."
We contacted the Newsweek offices in Wash
ington and spoke to Ann McDaniel, the reporter
for the above-mentioned story. She explained that
Newsweek interviewed O'Connor in 1971, when
Rehnquist was appointed to the Supreme Court.
O'Connor, then a legislator in Arizona, told
Newsweek the story about Rehnquist's Studebaker
and said that she had dated him in law school.
To try to add details to Newsweek's report, we
phoned the Supreme Court. We got as far as
O'Connor's chambers and were then referred to
the Supreme Court public relations office. Toni
House, who is in charge of the office, denied
Newsweek's report, saying that the justices
"certainly knew each other, but to the best of our
knowledge they never dated."
In fact, it would seem unlikely, according to
other Newsweek accounts, that the justices would
have had time to date while in school. Sandra
Day met her husband, John Jay O'Connor 111,
while attending law school. According to
Newsweek, the two wrote for the Stanford Law
Review and had dinner the first night they met. It
was the first of 46 straight dates.
Rehnquist also met his spouse, Natalie, at
Stanford, though there are no reports of his dating
records.
For the final word on this dating dispute, we
contacted Connie Hellier, director of News and
Publications at the Law School. She stated that
"nobody here has heard any such rumors" and
conjectured that the gossip may have started due
to the "coincidence of year," since both attended
school here until 1952.
This of course leaves the second part of your
question open for inquiry. Were you referring to
any particular issue that they may have voted
against?

Once again, we have spent countless hours of
research and thought, grappling with life's
greatest questions. We hope you agree that these
questions will never again tax the minds of the
wise and the well-read (that's you).
DEAR BUG ME: Near the Office of Manage
ment and Budget in the Quad, way up high in the
rafters, is a number 143 or 144, something like
that. Why? What does it mean? Someone went to
a lot of trouble to post those metal numerals!
— Pain in the neck
DEAR PAIN: We really had no idea what these
numerals represented so we accordingly began
our search for the answer at the Office of Manage
ment and Budget (OMB). Sure enough, near the
wooden ceiling of the arcade (that's the walkway
that surrounds the quadrangle) was the address
type number, 144. Was this figure part of an
outdated numbering system for the quadrangle
buildings? Did it refer to a little-known classroom
on the roof? Perhaps, we thought, because of
its location in front of the OMB, it indicated a se
cret drop point for money from anonymous
donors.
Further investigation of the rest of the quad
rangle revealed that these numbers are present in
most of the arcades, in ascending order, starting at
the archway to the east of Memorial Church.
Clearly, the numbers were part of some organiza
tional system for the entire quadrangle. We con
jectured that these numbers referred to the rela
tive importance of the offices and departments
below them. Surprisingly, this hypothesis made a
lot of sense; God is at number one, University
President Donald Kennedy lies somewhere be
tween 16 and 20, the Philosophy Department ap
pears at 34 and Geology comes close to dead last
at 139.
We contacted the University Archives at Green
Library for a more complete answer. A search of
the architectural drawings for the inner and outer
quadrangles revealed no sign of a numbering sys
tem in the arcades. Roxanne Nilan, curator of the
archives, suggested that the numbers were used to
aid in the reconstruction of the quadrangle after

the earthquake of 1906.
Next, we phoned Bruce Wiggins, associate
director of Operations, Maintenance and
Utilities. Wiggins had no explanation for the
numbering system and indicated that the
numerals are not presently part of a scheme for
servicing the quadrangle.
With no answer in sight, we returned to the
quadrangle for another look. After a few minutes
of staring at the arcade ceilings, and with an
amazing display of logic, we solved the mystery.

fixture, though there are some newer fixtures
