# Perkins files brutality suit
## Protester seeks $600,000 from University and county 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
Recent graduate Robby Perkins
has filed a $600,000 suit against the
University and Santa Clara County,
alleging brutality and race discrimi
nation during and after his arrest at a
campus anti-apartheid sit-in last Oc
tober.
The suit, submitted June 27 at the
U.S. District Court in San Jose by
his attorney, James Mellon, seeks
$100,000 in general damages and
$500,000 in punitive and exemplary
damages. The suit names several in
dividuals as defendants, including
University President Donald Ken
nedy, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, Santa Clara County
Sheriff Robert Winter and eight offi
cers present during the arrest.
Perkins, who received degrees in
economics and international rela
tions, filed the suit after both the
University and Santa Clara County
rejected claims he filed in January.
Perkins' suit lists nine causes of
action, including assault and battery
by the arresting officers and
negligence in hiring, retention and
supervision by their superiors.
The University has been served
the suit but has not had time to

examine it, according to University
Staff Counsel Mike Vartain. The
University rejected Perkins' claim
on the grounds that there was no
evidence of wrongdoing on the part
of the University's officers, he said.
"I don't know of any new facts that
might have any hearing in the case,''
he added.
-Neither Kennedy nor Ann Rable,
counsel for Santa Clara County,
would comment. Both said they had
not been served with a copy of the
suit.
None of the officers named in the
suit wished to comment.
Lawyers for both sides will meet
in November for a pre-trial status
conference.
Perkins said his primary goal in
filing the suit was not personal mon
etary gain. He said he plans to
donate any settlement money to
charity.
"Two words that sum up why
we're doing this: truth and justice,"
said Perkins, the only black arrested
at the October 11 sit-in at the Old
Union. "The truth is that it was a
racist police action and the justice is
to create an effective deterrent in the
form of a tangible punishment. If
contrition had been demonstrated,
then all this (the suit) might never

have happened. The important
thing is to prevent this brutality from
occurring again."
Perkins was arrested along with
eight other protesters at the sit-in.
The police used compliance-pain
holds on the protesters who had
gone limp, Perkins said. The
protesters were transported to the
North County jail facility.
"There, he (Perkins) was strip
searched without cause and physi
cally beaten and verbally harassed by
Sgt. Kirts (one of the defendants)
and other members of the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Depart
ment," Perkins' suit claims. "The
plaintiff was punched in the face,
brutally thrown to the floor, kneed
in the back and his clothes were
violently stripped from his body.
"His arms and facc were smashed
to the floor . . . Perkins was then left
naked in the full view of the inmates
in the jail," the suit continues.
After Perkins' claim was rejected
by both the University and the
county in January, he spent the next
five months organizing his case with
his lawyer, he said.
According to Perkins, the Ameri
