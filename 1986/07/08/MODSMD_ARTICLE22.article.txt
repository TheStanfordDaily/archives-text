## Laughter, dance and horror stocked up in 'Little Shop' 
### CHRISTINE LAWTON 
"Little Shop of Horrors," pre
sented by Theatre Works in Palo
Alto, is comedy horror (or is that
horrible comedy?) at its best. The
story, adapted from a 1960s spoof by
Roger Corman, centers around a
sorry excuse for a man and his
blood-thirsty plant.
This musical comedy, a 1982
Howard Ashman/Alan Menken
remake of the released film,
combines all of the necessary
horror-flick ingredients: good guy,
bad guy, wimpy girl, monster,
death, etc. What it adds, however, is
what makes "Little Shop" so enjoy
able. Namely, it becomes a cross be
tween "The Rocky Horror Picture
Show," "Revenge of the Nerds" and
a MoTown revival.
The cast, directed by
Theatre Works' Robert Kelley, is
headed by Seymour (Eric Wen
berg), the pathetically ncrdy flower
shop assistant to the greedy shop
owner, Mr. Mushnik (George
Ward). Audrey (Betty Porter), an
other shop assistant, is a pre
feminism marvel, who jumps at the

snap of her boyfriend Orin's (Paul
Vincent Edwards) sadistic fingers.
Feminists beware: it's not a pretty
sight. Chiffon (Deborah Swisher),
Crystal (Carla Vaughn) and Ron
nette (Velina Brown) complete the
human cast as the street-kids
turned-MoI own-girl-group — with
beautifully blended harmonies to
match.
Undoubtedly, however, the main
attraction of the show is Audrey 11,
th e carnivorous plant/monster
named after the object of Seymour's
desires. The plant is played by two
actors — Brian Heuckroth, who
works up quite a sweat as he brings
the plant to life, and Charles Sims
111, who gives Audrey II its devilish,
street-talking personality.
Ihe plot revolves around
Seymour and his "strange and unus
ual plant." Mushnik allows
Seymour to put the plant in his
flower shop window, hoping that it
might attract some business.
Lo and behold, the plan works
and the story is off and running. The
plot thickens as Seymour realizes
that the plant is bringing in money,
but heavens, what it eats!

And yes, we could compare what
happens next to serious literature as
Seymour effectively sells his soul,
but this is schlock and camp . . .
and the audience knows it. What's
best, they're having fun with it.
Wenberg is delightful in his
portrayal of Seymour. In the songs
"Grow for Me" and "Suddenly
Seymour," we see Seymour at his
goofiest. It almost makes you
wonder about the real Wenberg.
Porter's Audrey, meanwhile, is a
cross between jayne Mansfield and
your worst dizzy blonde nightmare.
What her character lacks in person
ality, though, is made up for by
sheer talent. Her musical numbers
"Somewhere That's Green" and
"Suddenly Seymour" are crisp and
powerful.
Edwards' Orin is an evil contrast
to Seymour's spinelessness. He's just
downright mean. Ward's Mushnik is
believable, if not memorable.
The Girl-Group probably best
showcases the talents of the musi
cal's choreographer, Evelyn
Thomas. The women almost create
a show of their own with Thomas'
dances.

Ultimately, "Little Shop of Hor
rors" is filled with thrills, chills and
laughs. . . and even a few surprises.
While there doesn't seem to be any
one shining star, the cast performs
beautifully as a team, turning the
production into a glittering array of
shining moments as the characters

yield to each other for solos.
"Little Shop of Horrors" kicks off
Theatre Works' 17th Summer Fes
tival with a gleeful shriek. It offers
unexpected twists to a surprising plot
that guarantees to please. Skip the
summer horror films this season and
see this one.
