# Ruthless: a king's ransom
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
Few people would accuse recent movies of being
original, which probably explains why fewer people are
going to the movies and why the balance of humanity is
hunkered down in front of the family VCR.
So when the advance advertising campaign for
"Ruthless People" announced the film would focus
around the idea of a kidnap victim who is so irritating
that the kidnappers eventually beg for her release, few
video store owners rushed to cash in and convert their
shops to tofutti parlors.
With the creative team of Jim Abrahams, David
Zucker and Jerry Zuckcr directing, many people
thought (well, 1 did) the movie would be similar in na
ture to "Airplane" or "Top Secret," two of their previous
high-grossing ventures.
While the premise of "Ruthless People" is not partic
ularly novel, its style is a marked departure from the
usual Abrahams & Co. hi jinks. Sight gags, long their
trademark, arc few and the comedy centers on mistaken
identity and mistaken motives.
All too often in this kind of comedy the action turns
vicious for the sake of being vicious. Fortunately,
"Ruthless People" avoids this trap and maintains a good
natured tone.
Danny Devito plays loathsome Los Angeles mil
lionaire clothier Sam Stone, whose main preoccupation
at the beginning of the movie is the quick destruction of
his spoiled wife (Bette Midler) and the subsequently
quick marriage to his mistress (Anita Morris). He arrives
home, bottle ot chloroform in hand, only to find that
his darling has been kidnapped by some self-described
"utterly ruthless" miscreants. The kidnappers turn out

to be an unprepossessing suburban couple named the
Kesslers, Ken (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (an adorable
Helen Slater). The Kesslers' motivation is vengeance;
apparently Stone has stolen some of Sandy's swimsuit
ideas. I o further this end, the Kesslers demand
$500,000 in ransom.
Stone does everything in his power to carry out the
abductors' instructions — incorrectly, that is. Mean
while, Mrs. Stone is being uncooperative, causing Ken
some moments of excruciating pain and driving Sandy
to tears. Stone's actions are completely bewildering to
the couple. And with the addition of a blackmail plot in
which Stone's mistress tries to implicate him for his
wife's murder, the film comes up with some classic situ
ations of hilarity.
Devito is in top form in his typecast role: quick,
abusive and two steps from a perforated stomach. Excus
ing himself to answer the phone, he snarls, "Debbie?
She can't come to the phone right now; I've got my dick
in her mouth," slams down the receiver, looks up and
laughs, "I love wrong numbers."
But it's a guy named Bill Pullman who has the key
role. He is Karl, Stone's mistress' boyfriend, a rather
slow member of the species. Sporting a two-toned butch
haircut and vacant expression, he is the perfect foil for
everyone.
You can't help but appreciate a guy who has been
labeled by the police chief as "the stupidest man I've
ever seen," and to which his underling answers,
"Perhaps we should shoot him now."
Because it doesn't sacrifice its pace for its light
headedness, "Ruthless People is the funniest movie
I've seen this summer in Mountain View, and it
deserves to make monev hand over fist.
