# City Nights offers the same old thing
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
My most sincere sympathies to
the owners of City Nights
nightclub at Harrison and Third
in the South of Market district of
San Francisco. Though ad-

vertised as a "hotspot," this
nightclub succeeded in being
lukewarm, at best.
It left me with a "who cares if I
ever go back there again" attitude
— nothing positively excited me
about this supposed forum of fun
lovers, and to make matters
worse, anything that did move
me did so in a negative fashion.
In fact, if I had to make a con
viction stick in the case of City
Nights, it would be guilty on
three counts of "the same old
thing" — the same old people,

the same old set-up and the same
old music.
Simply to label the crowd as
"plastic" would be an understate
ment considering the vibes
emitted by these people. I
honestly do not believe anyone
there was having a memorable
evening; however, there was a le
gion of great pretenders, each
armed with that "buy me a drink"
look and two pig-toed left feet.
In a word, the place was simply
too yuppie to be enjoyable. The
crowd had "stand clear, this is my
big night out" written all over it.
The people looked as if they had
rolled in from investment banks
and financial brokerages with the
common goal of high-powered
fun. As the evening wore on,
their lofty expectations soon dis
sipated, leaving only a bunch of
fashion look-alikes indulging in
excessive drinking and self
centered partner dancing. No
thank you very much, I'll pass.
As much as it pains me to

swing the wrecking ball clear
through the roof of City Nights, this
place deserves all the notoriety I can
give it. Even the music, which was
the standard breed of overplayed
funk and time-tested favorites, was
nothing to rave about — certainly
not inspirational enough to make
you lose yourself in dance. If you
want to hear hit radio without the
commercials, then be my guest. But
if you want progressive dance music,
save your $6 cover charge. Per
sonally, I do not go out for what I
can get at home.
Nevertheless, if you have a
shortage of hilarious stories to relate
to your grandchildren, City Nights
may be just the place for you to
accrue a few.
One incident that will forever be
with me involved a friend of mine
named Wayne and a woman from
Marin. The humor began when she
asked Wayne to dance a set and
proceeded to do so in a manner that

went beyond embarrassing —
straight to hilarious. Her dancing
style consisted of hillbilly sidestep
ping and periodic bows that made
her look like a drowning goat bob
bing for air.
All of this coupled with the lurid
advances she was making toward
Wayne made the scene a sight to be
hold. This is the way the world turns
inside the doors of City Nights. If
you are a yuppie or someday wish to
be one, you may like the scene. As
for me, the place would have to get a
whole lot looser for me to frequent
it.
Furthermore, if you dress in a
manner that is anything but tragi
cally unoriginal, expect people to
look at you as if your flying saucer is
double-parked out front.
This lack of tolerance is most evi
dent in people's unwillingness to
work their bodies on the dance floor.
Once the first bead of sweat falls,
they make a beeline for the nearest
chair or the bar. Heaven forbid they
should offset the freshly pressed
creases in their trousers.
My philosophy is somewhat dif

ferent. I like to dance — with the
wall or a partner — I am not partial.
When I am surrounded by people
who feel the same way, my karmic
fantasies have been realized, and by
all means, let the sweat roll. I still
have not figured out why some
people wait around for a "suitable"
partner to happen along before
glazing the dance floor. You paid
your cover without anybody's help.
Now dance the same way. Today is
the age of independence, so get with
it.
If you would like to try City
Nights and at least break even, I
have a few free passes that I do not
intend to use . . . ever, and will
gladly give them away. To capitalize
on this once in a lifetime opportu
nity, send your name, address and a
short note (for my own curiosity)
saying why you think you would en
joy City Nights to: The Night Guy,
Storke Publications Building, Stan
ford. This address can also be used
to make suggestions for reviews or
voice disagreements with the point
of view offered here. My ears are
open. Speak to me.

My most sincere sympathies to
the owners of City Nights
nightclub at Harrison and Third
in the South of Market district of
San Francisco. Though ad-

vertised as a "hotspot," this
nightclub succeeded in being
lukewarm, at best.
It left me with a "who cares if I
ever go back there again" attitude
— nothing positively excited me
about this supposed forum of fun
lovers, and to make matters
worse, anything that did move
me did so in a negative fashion.
In fact, if I had to make a con
viction stick in the case of City
Nights, it would be guilty on
three counts of "the same old
thing" — the same old people,

the same old set-up and the same
old music.
Simply to label the crowd as
"plastic" would be an understate
ment considering the vibes
emitted by these people. I
honestly do not believe anyone
there was having a memorable
evening; however, there was a le
gion of great pretenders, each
armed with that "buy me a drink"
look and two pig-toed left feet.
In a word, the place was simply
too yuppie to be enjoyable. The
crowd had "stand clear, this is my
big night out" written all over it.
The people looked as if they had
rolled in from investment banks
and financial brokerages with the
common goal of high-powered
fun. As the evening wore on,
their lofty expectations soon dis
sipated, leaving only a bunch of
fashion look-alikes indulging in
excessive drinking and self
centered partner dancing. No
thank you very much, I'll pass.
As much as it pains me to

swing the wrecking ball clear
through the roof of City Nights, this
place deserves all the notoriety I can
give it. Even the music, which was
the standard breed of overplayed
funk and time-tested favorites, was
nothing to rave about — certainly
not inspirational enough to make
you lose yourself in dance. If you
want to hear hit radio without the
commercials, then be my guest. But
if you want progressive dance music,
save your $6 cover charge. Per
sonally, I do not go out for what I
can get at home.
Nevertheless, if you have a
shortage of hilarious stories to relate
to your grandchildren, City Nights
may be just the place for you to
accrue a few.
One incident that will forever be
with me involved a friend of mine
named Wayne and a woman from
Marin. The humor began when she
asked Wayne to dance a set and
proceeded to do so in a manner that

went beyond embarrassing —
straight to hilarious. Her dancing
style consisted of hillbilly sidestep
ping and periodic bows that made
her look like a drowning goat bob
bing for air.
All of this coupled with the lurid
advances she was making toward
Wayne made the scene a sight to be
hold. This is the way the world turns
inside the doors of City Nights. If
you are a yuppie or someday wish to
be one, you may like the scene. As
for me, the place would have to get a
whole lot looser for me to frequent
it.
Furthermore, if you dress in a
manner that is anything but tragi
cally unoriginal, expect people to
look at you as if your flying saucer is
double-parked out front.
This lack of tolerance is most evi
dent in people's unwillingness to
work their bodies on the dance floor.
Once the first bead of sweat falls,
they make a beeline for the nearest
chair or the bar. Heaven forbid they
should offset the freshly pressed
creases in their trousers.
