My most sincere sympathies to
the owners of City Nights
nightclub at Harrison and Third
in the South of Market district of
San Francisco. Though ad-

vertised as a "hotspot," this
nightclub succeeded in being
lukewarm, at best.
It left me with a "who cares if I
ever go back there again" attitude
— nothing positively excited me

Simply to label the crowd as
"plastic" would be an understate

armed with that "buy me a drink"
look and two pig-toed left feet.
In a word, the place was simply
too yuppie to be enjoyable. The
crowd had "stand clear, this is my
big night out" written all over it.
The people looked as if they had
rolled in from investment banks
and financial brokerages with the
common goal of high-powered
fun. As the evening wore on,
their lofty expectations soon dis
sipated, leaving only a bunch of
fashion look-alikes indulging in
excessive drinking and self
centered partner dancing. No
thank you very much, I'll pass.
