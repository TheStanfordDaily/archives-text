## Kingman's latest stunt is disrespectful, intolerable 
### 
The Dave Kingman/Susan Fornoff rat inci
dent has pretty much been beaten to death by
the media lately.
What the heck, let's beat it some more.
For those of you in a different country last
week, or who don't usually read the sports

page, slugger Dave Kingman of the Oakland
A's has had a running feud with Susan For
noff, a sports reporter for the Sacramento Bee,
for two years. It culminated last week when
Kingman sent Fornoff a live rat in a box to the
press box.
The reason — Kingman does not approve of

women in the locker room.
As a woman who plans to pursue a career in
sports media, I obviously do not approve of
Kingman. His behavior was childish, boorish
and chauvinistic. It was also dumb and point
less.
Kingman lost the battle years ago; women
have been covering sporting events from male
locker rooms this entire decade, and in ever
increasing numbers.
At first I thought, "No big deal, just a
juvenile display of ignorant, medieval think
ing." I figured the controversy would calm
down after public opinion strongly censured
King Kong," who verified his nickname by
acting like a big ape.
Unfortunately, that's not what happened. It
seems as if society remains unenlightened
about equal rights. Kingman got away with a
mere slap on the wrist, a $3500 fine (he makes
$600,000 a year) and no apology to Fornoff.

SLUSSER
That was all she had requested — no
fine, just an apology.
Letters to the A's have been run
ning 3-1 in favor of Kingman. Let
ters to the San Francisco Chronicle
were also disappointing. One was
particularly archaic. Greg Zagel of
San Jose wrote, "I say hooray for the
King and as for Miss Fornoff, why
don't you get married and stay at
home where you belong?"
There's something wrong here.
This is the 1980s. People are
supposed to be able to choose their
own careers and do their jobs with
out fear of harassment. Sportswriters
have confirmed that Kingman's be
havior to Fornoff the last two years
'has been insufferable, ranging from
loud comments on her sexual
preferences to slamming bats on
tables in front of her.
For her part, Fornoff has handled
the situation admirably. For the past
two years she has had to avoid

Kingman and has not interviewed
him. She did not cause a scene
upon receiving the rat (although
Kingman, in character, greeted
reporters after that game with a box
of tissues saying, "Tears? Tears?")
and has not mentioned the situation
in any of her articles.
There is not much left for her to
do. There is little possibility of a suit
on grounds of sexual harassment
(though it certainly would be justi
fied) and the A's are not willing to
punish the veteran sufficiently.
Meanwhile, I hope the A's wise
up and treat Kingman a little more
strictly. He probably won't be
around much longer anyway, thank
goodness. Oakland has the worst
record in baseball and the
sometimes designated hitter is bat
ting a mere .213. Oakland needs
players who will help them at the
plate rather than hurt them in the
public relations department.
Update: According to the San
Francisco Chronicle, 51 letters have
been received about the incident —
45 in favor of Kingman, six against.
