## Kingman's latest stunt is disrespectful, intolerable 
### 
The Dave Kingman/Susan Fornoff rat inci
dent has pretty much been beaten to death by
the media lately.
What the heck, let's beat it some more.
For those of you in a different country last
week, or who don't usually read the sports

page, slugger Dave Kingman of the Oakland
A's has had a running feud with Susan For
noff, a sports reporter for the Sacramento Bee,
for two years. It culminated last week when
Kingman sent Fornoff a live rat in a box to the
press box.
The reason â€” Kingman does not approve of

women in the locker room.
As a woman who plans to pursue a career in
sports media, I obviously do not approve of
Kingman. His behavior was childish, boorish
and chauvinistic. It was also dumb and point
less.
Kingman lost the battle years ago; women
have been covering sporting events from male
locker rooms this entire decade, and in ever
increasing numbers.
At first I thought, "No big deal, just a
juvenile display of ignorant, medieval think
ing." I figured the controversy would calm
down after public opinion strongly censured
King Kong," who verified his nickname by
acting like a big ape.
Unfortunately, that's not what happened. It
seems as if society remains unenlightened
about equal rights. Kingman got away with a
mere slap on the wrist, a $3500 fine (he makes
$600,000 a year) and no apology to Fornoff.
