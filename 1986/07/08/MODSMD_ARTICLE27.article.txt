# Hagler has proven himself, should retire now
## 
### 
In an era of superstar athletes hanging on too long and em
barrassing themselves, it was both surprising and refreshing to
hear Marvelous Marvin Hagler announce last week that he
may retire from the ring.
Some of the greatest players from each sport have played to
the point where they were a mere shadow of their former selves:
Willie Mays in baseball and O.J. Simpson and Joe Namath in
football, to name a few. Boxers are especially notorious for

not being able to judge when their careers should end. The
most famous example, of course, is Muhammad Ali. After be
coming known worldwide as the most talented and flamboyant
athlete of his era, Ali made a shameful comeback, being
humiliated by former sparring partner Larry Holmes and then
losing to Trevor Berbick, who would not even have been
granted a shot at Ali during his prime.
Many in the boxing industry see Hagler's possible retirement
as a detriment to the sport, and certainly he would be missed.
He is, in my opinion, the greatest champion since Ali and has
to be ranked as one of the best middleweights ever. He has
taken apart all challengers and made several good fighters —
Thomas Hearns, for example — look pathetically vulnerable.
There is no doubt that the already-floundering world of
boxing would suffer without its leading man, and Hagler still
has the capabilities to fight on, but his decision to retire, if
made, would have to be applauded.
Not being an expert on boxing by any stretch of the imagina
tion, I was delighted to be able to talk to Walter Byars Sunday
night about Hagler. While my prizefighting experience is lim
ited to weekly shadow-boxing with my brother when we were
youngsters, Byars' credentials are impressive: New England
welterweight champion firoin 1956 to 1960, boxing referee un
til 1976, Massachusetts Boxing Commissioner from 1976 to

1981 and presently a fight trainer. Moreover, he has known
Hagler for over 10 years, having become a close friend during
his tenure as commissioner of Hagler's home state. Byars most
recently spoke to Hagler just two weeks ago.
The stereotype of a boxer is one who uses his fighting skills to
climb out of the ghetto. Most are seen as lacking in the brains
department, and it can't be denied that many have been hurt
by their inability to foresee the need to quit. Hagler, however,
is not stereotypical, in Byars' estimation. "He's a very intelli
gent young man," Byars said. "He knows at any time your
crown can fall — Joe Louis fought and ended up broke, and
Ali's a sick man now. In my opinion, yes, he'll retire."
Byars said that Hagler, in fact, has considered retirement
before. "He's contemplated retiring before, but he had the
desire to be a great champion. He had never been recognizcd.
It was a personal goal."
Byars indicated that many factors have led Hagler to ponder
retiring, the most influential of which may be the fact that lie's
been boxing for nearly two decades. "It takes a lot out of you
personally," Byars said. "After a while, it becomes drudgery. It
no longer has the excitement. He's been in the game for 17 or
18 years."
Also in Hagler's mind is the opportunity to settle down and
pursue other interests. "He's had a lot of hard times, and now
he has a chance to enjoy life," Byars said. While many boxers
have little to fall back on and therefore try to squeeze the sport
for every possible payday, Hagler does not find himself in such
a predicament. He owns a successful sporting goods store in
Boston, is a household name in his hometown of Brockton,
and, according to Byars, will "be in the gym all the time help
ing out not only his brother (Robby Sims, recent winner over
Roberto Duran) but Goody and Pat (the Petronellis, who cur
rently are his trainers)."
But why, at the top of his game, would Hagler retire? He
certainly does not fit the description of an aging superstar who
no longer can mix it up with the up-and-coming young
fighters'. Furthermore, he could earn 10 million dollars for one
more fight.
Byars explained that Hagler no longer needs the money or
the fame. "The 10 million has very little to be considered,"
Byars said. "He's not as flamboyant as say Roberto Duran. He's
not likely to spend money quickly.
"You only have to prove to yourself, and he's done that,"

Byars added. "Anyone who he was to fight, he fought. He
didn't duck."
But what about Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns,
both of whom want a shot at Hagler? "Leonard has been out of
the gym for two years," Byars said. "What makes people think
he should fight Leonard? Two to three years ago, I would have
picked him to beat Marvin. Now, I can't even see it."
Byars said that had Leonard never suffered his detached ret
ina, he would be a monster of an opponent for Hagler. With
the injury, however, Leonard is "gun shy," Byars said. "Hagler
is one physical specimen. If you've got a weak spot, he'll go for
it."
As for a possible Hagler-Leonard fight, Byars said, "I don't
even think I'd like to see it." And as for a rematch with the "Hit
Man" from Detroit, Byars simply commented, "He's beaten
Hearns."
Logic seems to point to Hagler's retirement. Yet, he was
anything but decisive at last week's press conference. "I've
made no decision," he said.
The question now becomes flipped: Why would Hagler not
retire? Byars explained that recognition is not easily given up.
"It's a hell of a feeling to be recognized, to walk down the street
and hear people say, 'Hi, champ.' "
Byars said, however, that the fame would most likely not
keep Hagler fighting. A thought that is more likely weighing in
Hagler's mind is the belief that with one last fight would come
his curtain call — his "last hurrah."
"Now, it's not the money or recognition," Byars indicated.
It would be like saying, Tin going out people, watch me.'
Still, Byars predicts an 80 percent likelihood that Hagler will
retire without fighting anymore. "You either lose or retire (as
champion), he said. Hopefully, in this case, retire. If he
fights one more time, he's retiring after that. That's one thing 1
can be sure of."
I echo Byars' hope that Hagler retires now, but if not, it is
reassuring to know that he will fight just once more and then
get out. It is tragically ironic that Ali labeled himself "The
Greatest and is now almost completely incomprehensible in
speech. Hagler, whom Byars calls "The Greatest," unquestion
ably has the ability to continue fighting, but he seems to have
learned from Ali's mistake. As a result, his life after boxing
should be as sweet as his fabulous reign as middleweight cham
pion.
