# Varian accepts blame for new chemical spill

Varian Associates is responsible for con
taminating Palo Alto's Matadero Creek and
part of Stanford Industrial Park with
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), according to
lab analyses completed over the weekend.
The situation is not serious, however, be
cause the PCB leaked only for a short time,
Dr. Larry Kolb of the Bay Area Regional
Water Quality Control Board said yesterday.
After hearing of the discovery of the
suspected cancer-causing chemicals in the
Barron Park residential area, homeowners
held a press conference yesterday to express
their concern and to offer solutions to the

problem. Residents were notified by letter last
Saturday of the PCB contamination.
Thirteen parts per million of PCB were
found in the creek water, more than the seven
parts per million deemed to be a health risk by
the Department of Health Services. Water
from the creek is not used for drinking
purposes.
PCB compounds are a class of stable chemi
cals that are not biodegradable and cannot be
metabolized. PCB accumulates as it moves up
the food chain and becomes increasingly let
hal to both its consumers and the ecosystem.
But according to Kolb, "Incidental contact
of PCB is not a significant health hazard." It is
also insoluble in water, but can dissolve into
the surrounding soil. Kolb said he is more

concerned with the effects of PCB on the
ecosystem than on the health of people and
animals who have played in the water.
The PCBs were found in a storm drain of
Varian Building 2, the same drain initially re
sponsible for leaking a coolant into the creek
late last month. Investigation of the creek
began when neighbors noticed an "oily sheen"
on the surface of the water.
PCB leakage stopped when Varian plugged
up a floor drain leading to the storm drain
June 26, according Gary Simpson, vice presi
dent of Corporate Communications at Varian.
PCB is not a component of the coolant, and
the company does not know why PCB was
found in the drain, Simpson said.
"Our initial thought was that it was a resi

due from years gone by," he said, adding that
the floor drain serves no purpose.
At the Barron Park press conference, resi
dents said they are not convinced that current
clean-up projects are enough to ensure their
safety and unveiled their own "action plan" to
help rectify the problem, said Jane Mickelson,
a member of the Barron Park Association,
representing the residents.
I he plan includes searching the industrial
park for any more leaks, obtaining samples of
both the soil and the water over the next six
weeks and a full disclosure of past, present and
possible future spill and clean-up plans.
