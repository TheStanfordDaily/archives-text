# Stanford to manage international project
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
I he California Department of
Education has chosen Stanford to be
one of three institutions managing a
statewide project to enhance inter
national studies in the state's
elementary and secondary schools.
The University will oversee the
California International Studies
Project (CISP) along with Global
Educators and the World Affairs
Council of California — two
community-based organizations
concerned with education and inter
national affairs.
The idea for CISP grew out of the
success of the Bay Area Global Edu
cation Program, which originated at
Stanford in 1979. The program, run
by the three institutions now govern
ing CISP, was also designed to stim
ulate the study of international af
fairs in schools.

Last September, the California
State Assembly passed Bill 2543,
which set aside $480,000 for CISP
in the upcoming fiscal year.
Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-
Monterey) authored the bill and
State Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los
Altos), a co-sponsor, introduced the
legislation to the Senate.
"The legislation grew out of [the
Global Education Program's] active
experience, said Ronald Herring,
associate director of Stanford's Cen
ter for Research in International
Studies, which manages the Univer
sity's involvement in CISP.
As a managing institution for the
new project, the University will
choose the sites for international
resource centers, develop curricular
materials and manage the project's
funds.
Efforts to promote international
affairs in public schools sprung from concern over
declining student awareness of world affairs, Herring
said.
A state study recently showed that only 3 percent of
California's high school graduates have achieved a
meaningful fluency in a foreign language, Herring said.
In an attempt to correct the problem, CISP will estab
lish six international study centers this year, and with
additional funding in fiscal years 1987-88 and 1988-89,
it will expand to 18 centers.
Each center will provide teacher training services and

curricular materials for the one to five school districts
under its jurisdiction. Through these services, the proj
ect will educate elementary school students about the
historical and geographical development of major world
cultures, contemporary world issues, foreign languages
and other international skills and concepts.
Herring described the role of the centers in the
promotion of international studies as both a "producer
of materials and a definer of the process."
These regional study centers will also provide in
depth training activities for selected teachers. Some
teachers will study instructional strategies in interna
tional affairs, focusing on concepts like critical thinking,
historical context setting and conflict management,
Herring said.
