# Music house moves in harmony

Computer music. For many the term conjures up
images of rock musicians producing painful
screeches and ominous whirrs in New York recording
studios.
The home for Stanford's Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) would
seem to mimic that image. CCRMA moved out of
the D.C. Powers Laboratory and into the Knoll this
spring. The building, which originally housed Uni
versity presidents and then the Music Department, is
a 1916 Italian structure that provides a bit of a con
trast to the concept of computer technology.
You might expect this mansion to be filled with
antiques, tapestries and oil portraits of former presi
dents. Instead, subdued pink walls, new hardware
and mauve carpeting make up the very contemporary
decor. In fact, the outer image of the Knoll con
tradicts not only the center's inner image, but it con
tradicts the center's inner activities, which are
perched on the cutting edge of musical technology.
The contrasting image, however, is tbc least of the
concerns at the center. More important, is the con
trast in opinions regarding the new location itself.
"It's sort of a mixed blessing, said Patte Wood,
CCRMA's administrative director.

The center's approximately 40 students, faculty
and staff "used to be isolated,'' she said. "And that
allowed people here to concentrate on their work.
Now we're more accessible to people wanting things
like tours of the building."
But greater public accessibility will be good for the
center, she said. "We give three summer workshops.
It's better now that we're here because in the past
we've had problems with transportation and access to
food."
The center also presents demonstrations, with the
next scheduled for July 17. It will feature in-house as
well as guest composers, she said.
Wood said that the University initiated the move
because of problems with the old location, including
windows that didn't open, lack of air conditioning
and a non-functional heating system.
Now, however, all that has changed. The Knoll
comes complete with Italian styling, gardens, carpet
ing, heat, air conditioning and a beautiful view of
campus and the San Francisco Bay. Wood admits,
though, that there are still problems, like peeling
paint on one of the office ceilings.
One of the most impressive features of CCRMA's
new home is the extensive re-wiring, which includes
