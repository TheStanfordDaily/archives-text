# Music house moves in harmony

Computer music. For many the term conjures up
images of rock musicians producing painful
screeches and ominous whirrs in New York recording
studios.
The home for Stanford's Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) would
seem to mimic that image. CCRMA moved out of
the D.C. Powers Laboratory and into the Knoll this
spring. The building, which originally housed Uni
versity presidents and then the Music Department, is
a 1916 Italian structure that provides a bit of a con
trast to the concept of computer technology.
You might expect this mansion to be filled with
antiques, tapestries and oil portraits of former presi
dents. Instead, subdued pink walls, new hardware
and mauve carpeting make up the very contemporary
decor. In fact, the outer image of the Knoll con
tradicts not only the center's inner image, but it con
tradicts the center's inner activities, which are
perched on the cutting edge of musical technology.
The contrasting image, however, is tbc least of the
concerns at the center. More important, is the con
trast in opinions regarding the new location itself.
"It's sort of a mixed blessing, said Patte Wood,
CCRMA's administrative director.

The center's approximately 40 students, faculty
and staff "used to be isolated,'' she said. "And that
allowed people here to concentrate on their work.
Now we're more accessible to people wanting things
like tours of the building."
But greater public accessibility will be good for the
center, she said. "We give three summer workshops.
It's better now that we're here because in the past
we've had problems with transportation and access to
food."
The center also presents demonstrations, with the
next scheduled for July 17. It will feature in-house as
well as guest composers, she said.
Wood said that the University initiated the move
because of problems with the old location, including
windows that didn't open, lack of air conditioning
and a non-functional heating system.
Now, however, all that has changed. The Knoll
comes complete with Italian styling, gardens, carpet
ing, heat, air conditioning and a beautiful view of
campus and the San Francisco Bay. Wood admits,
though, that there are still problems, like peeling
paint on one of the office ceilings.
One of the most impressive features of CCRMA's
new home is the extensive re-wiring, which includes
about 15 different outlets and
sockets gracing the walls of
Wood's office. "All rooms are
wired for sound," she said.
Another advantage of the
move, Wood said, was the
construction of permanent
studios. "There were no real
studios at Powers. We had
makeshift studios," she said.
CCRMA also lacked a
recording studio at their old
home. "That meant that we
traveled to other places to
record," Wood said. "But that
was OK because sometimes
you want to travel for certain
acoustic properties."
One musician with the cen
ter, working from a grant,
even went to Switzerland to
record cow-bells in the moun
tains, she said.
But more often, traveling
meant going to another loca
tion nearby, with all of the
equipment in tow, to record in
an atmosphere that was
acoustically better than what
was available at Stanford. The
new studios will make things
easier.
"The studio has a variable
environment," Wood said.
"We can make it wetter or
drier. We can change acous
tics."
The new studios also pro
vide room for the wealth of
electronic musical equipment
that the center uses for signal
processing, sound synthesis
and digital recording.
Although still settling into
their new home, Wood said
that the move was a step in the
right direction.
