A bronze statue of a dragonfly that was stolen over a month ago
from the courtyard of the St. Ann Chapel-Stanford Newman Center
in Palo Alto was returned early Saturday, according to a worker at the
chapel.
The statue was returned without a note one day after the theft was
publicized in the Times Tribune.
"This Saturday I found it wrapped up in a sheet sitting out by the
chapel front. It looked like somebody had planted it in a yard," said
the worker, who asked not to be named.
The statue, which for 18 years has decorated a small courtyard
fountain, was first reported missing last week by Patricia Villemain,
the chapel's next door neighbor. Villemain reported the theft to the
Times Tribune late last week.
Rev. Timothy Kidney said he didn't file a theft report with the
police because he did not think the thief could be apprehended, he
told the Times Tribune. Kidney is currently on vacation and could
not be reached for comment.
