# First child bone transplant recipient recovers
## 
### MORRIE RATNER Staff writer 
A four-year-old leukemia victim
is in good condition after becoming
the first child to receive a bone mar
row transplant at Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center, but doctors say
they will not know for several
months whether the operation was a
complete success.
Dr. Michael Amylon, a staff
hematologist-oncologist at the Stan
ford Children's Hospital, directed
Darren Cachola's successful bone
marrow transplant operation. Cac
hola was released from the hospital
June 25, and is now an outpatient
under Amylon's care.
Dr. Bertil Glader, associate pro
fessor of pediatrics and chief of
hematology-oncology at Stanford
Children's Hospital, said doctors
will not know for approximately six
months whether Darren is cured.
The success rate for bone marrow
transplants varies from 10 to 90 per
cent, Amylon said, depending on
the patient's previous exposure to
toxic materials, the disease being
treated and the similarity of the
tissue types transferred.
Possible complications of bone

marrow transplants include infec
tions due to suppressed immune sys
tems, cancer relapse due to an in
ability to kill the leukemia prior to
transplantation, and graft versus host
disease due to small differences in
individual tissue types, he said.
Until now, the Children's Hospi
tal has referred about eight patients
each year to other institutions
"hundreds or thousands of miles
away from their families, friends and
support structures," Amylon said.
This can be a "financial, emotional
and psychological burden for the
families
Although the program is currently
aimed at providing a clinical service,
in the future it may include research
that will, for example, expand the
use of bone marrow transplantation
to patients with less than perfectly
matched donors and to patients with
inherited diseases such as sickle-cell
anemia, thalassemia and inborn er
rors of metabolism, Amylon said.
To shield bone marrow recipients
from infection, the hospital built a
special suite of pressurized rooms
with air filters to remove airborne
dust and germs. This $200,000
facility, along with special staff
training and other expenses, was

funded by a $130,000 challenge
grant from the Irvine Foundation
and matching gifts from other
donors.
The new pediatric transplant pro
gram is one arm of the Medical
Center's recently expanded organ
transplant program and is currently
being defined, Glader said. The
University is looking for someone to
direct the Medical Center bone mar
row transplant program, he added.
When Grace and Magno Cachola
took their son to the doctor last Au
gust, they had no idea he was going
to be diagnosed as having a rare
childhood cancer. "(Darren) had a
cold so we took him to the doctor,
and the doctor asked why his skin
was swollen," Grace Cachola said.
"We didn't know. He took a blood
test and we found out he had
leukemia."
Cachola said she and her husband
brought their son to the Children's
Hospital, where Amylon told them a
bone marrow transplant was Dar
ren's only hope of beating the can
cer. "That was the only option we
had, except waiting until his sick
ness got worse," she said.
Darren's 10-year-old sister Mi
chelle donated bone marrow for his

transplant. "We were lucky," Cac
hola said. "We had blood typing
done many times to make sure Mi
chelle's bone marrow matched Dar
ren's. They were 98 percent compat
ible."

Suitable donors for bone marrow
transplants are available for only 35
to 40 percent of the children who
need them because tissue types be
tween the donor and host must be
nearly identical.
