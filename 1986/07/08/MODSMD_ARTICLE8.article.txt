## Supreme Court strikes down key budget act provision 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, acting
on the last day of its 1985 term, struck down the key
element of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
balancing law yesterday, ruling that its novel provi
sion for automatic budget cuts was unconstitutional.
The court, in a 7-2 ruling, said that Congress' un
precedented attempt to control soaring budget deficits
violated constitutional separation of powers, im
properly vesting executive branch authority in a
legislative branch officer, the comptroller general.
The court's ruling drew a vigorous dissent from
Justice Byron White, who said the court was striking
down "one of the most novel and far-reaching

legislative responses to a national crisis since the New
Deal."
Retiring Chief Justice Warren Burger, in his last
opinion for the court, agreed that "no one can doubt
that Congress and the president are confronted with
fiscal and economic problems of unprecedented
magnitude." But, he said, quoting a prior high court
ruling, " 'the fact that a given law or procedure is effi
cient, convenient and useful in facilitating functions
of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is
contrary to the Constitution. Convenience and effi
ciency are not the primary objectives — or the hal
lmarks — of democratic government.' "
President Reagan has named Justice William

Rehnquist, who also sided with the majority in this
ruling, as Burger's replacement.
The law, enacted last December, sets annual tar
gets for reducing the deficit over a five year period,
until it reaches zero in fiscal 1991. Three agencies —
the Office of Management and Budget, the Congres
sional Budget Office and the General Accounting
Office (GAO), which is headed by the comptroller
general — were to determine whether Congress had
met the yearly target. If the target was not met, the
GAO would have had the final word on the size and
nature of automatic across-the-board budget cuts ne
cessary to achieve the goal. The president would be

required to implement the determinations.
Under the Constitution's separation of powers,
Burger said, Congress is given the power to pass laws
to set general policy. The authority to carry out the
laws is given to the executive branch, under the presi
dent. There is no doubt, lie said, that the comptroller
general is "subservient" to Congress.
The ruling means that Congress, under a fallback
provision included in the law, will have to vote on
those budget cuts, which some observers say in effect
means business as usual.
The law's chief sponsors said they would try to
amend it to pass constitutional muster.
