# South African seeks asylum in Oakland
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO - A black
South African who was jailed after
jumping ship in California was
released on his own recognizance
yesterday as religious and commu
nity activists rallied around his re
quest for political asylum.
"I feel good now because I wanted
to belong to some country," said
Patrick Mtoto, 19, smiling shyly
after his release by U.S. Immigra
tion Judge Phillip Leadbetter. "Now
I am on my way to belonging to
America."
Mtoto was held in Oakland City
Jail for five days on $5000 bail after
he was booked on charges of entry
without inspection.
His case captured the imagination
of black religious leaders, who want
to use it to draw attention to the
plight of South Africans, and sup
porters of a new sanctuary proposal
in Oakland.
The Oakland City Council will
consider a resolution today calling
for Oakland to become the first
American city to declare itself a
sanctuary for refugees from South
Africa. Immigrants from El Sal
vador, Guatemala and Haiti also
would be included.
Joan Lohman of the Oakland City
of Refuge Committee said the
resolution instructs local officials, in
cluding police, not to cooperate
with agents from the Immigration
and Naturalization Service who are
seeking to arrest refugees.
Mtoto told officials he was born in
South Africa, but moved to the
Ivory Coast with his mother when
he was 10 years old. After his
mother died, he attended school and
lived with neighbors until three
months ago, when he hid aboard a
freighter bound for France.

He was discovered after five days.
When the ship's captain told him he
would be returned to either the Ivory
Coast or South Africa, Mtoto
grabbed a life preserver and leaped
into the chilly sea, where he floated
for five hours near the Strait of
Gibraltar.
Mtoto was picked up by the
Norwegian-owned tanker, Balder
Uljanik. The crew fed him and gave
him work as a painter, but otherwise
kept him locked up. Because he still
feared getting sent back to South
Africa, he again jumped ship at a
refinery in Avon, but he was caught
by security guards.
The religious community in the
San Francisco Bay area has
embraced Mtoto's case and different
churches have agreed to provide
him with food, clothing and
housing.
Meanwhile, in South Africa, gov
ernment opponents won their first
legal victory yesterday against the
present state of emergency when a
Johannesburg judge ordered a politi
cal detainee to be freed and declared
that police actions were subject to
court review even under the emer
gency decrees.
Civil rights lawyers in South
Africa now plan to bring similar
cases to other courts in an effort to
place some legal restrictions on ac
tions by the police and army.
The South African government
confirmed that the last restrictions
on Winnie Mandela, wife of the im
prisoned African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, had been
lifted following several court cases in
March that effectively invalidated
orders preventing her from living in
Soweto.
