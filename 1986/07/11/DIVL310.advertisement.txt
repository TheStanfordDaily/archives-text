experience-building job before going to
law school?
We are a small firm in downtown Palo Alto specializing in
trusts and estates, elder law, and some business law and civil
litigation. We seek a bright, energetic secretary/word
processor with an interest in law to join our family for at least
a year, beginning in late July. Solid typing skills and an
aptitude for WordStar are musts; above all, we seek someone
who learns quickly and gets along well with others. The ideal

legal background before attending law school. The salary will
be in the $18,000 - $20,000 range. Call Mr. Stern at 325-3303.
