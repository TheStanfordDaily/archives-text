## Whitworth wrote FBI letters, defense admits as trial ends 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO — Former Navy radioman
Jerry Whitworth, charged with spying for the Soviet
Union, wrote anonymous letters to the FBI in 1984
confessing involvement in a Soviet-run spy ring and
offering to expose it, his lawyer said yesterday.
"I'm not going to quibble with you. . . . The
writer of the RUS letters was Jerry Whitworth,"
defense lawyer James Larson told a federal court jury
in a stunning admission during closing arguments in
Whitworth's spy trial.
But Larson insisted that even the letters, once de
scribed by the trial judge as a virtual confession, did
not prove the crucial requirement of the prosecu
tion's case: that Whitworth knew or had reason to
believe, at the time he sold communications secrets
to the John Walker spy ring, that his actions would
harm the United States or help the Soviet Union.
From the outset, Whitworth was working under
"the benevolent but mistaken belief that the classified
information he passed would be going to an ally,"
Larson said.
He said Whitworth did not conclude Walker was a
Soviet agent "until after Mr. Whitworth had stopped
supplying any information to Mr. Walker."
Larson's version was disputed sharply by Asst.
U.S. Attorney William Farmer in a two-hour rebut
tal that ended the 12-week trial. The case goes to the
jury today.

It is "absurd" to suggest "that jerry Whitworth
recently had a revelation that he was dealing with the
Soviet Union," Farmer said.
Recalling that Walker, when he decided to spy in
1968, went immediately to the Soviet embassy with
decoding information, Farmer said, "What was ob
vious to John Walker in 1968 had to be obvious to
Jerry Whitworth in 1974 (when Walker recruited
him): there was but one logical buyer for crypto
graphic intelligence . . . the other superpower.
He scoffed at Larson's suggestion that Whitworth
had backed out of the spy operation after becoming
suspicious of Soviet involvement in the later years,
saying Whitworth had written Walker a coded letter
on the day of Walker's arrest in May 1985, offering to
return to espionage.
As Larson described it, Whitworth was misled by
Walker at his recruitment in 1974 into thinking the
secrets were being bought by Israel, but started
growing suspicious around 1980, and cut off the
supply of classified documents — even sabotaging
one set of photographs — before writing the letters.
The letters, signed RUS, were received by the San
Francisco FBI office between May and August 1984.
The first letter offered to expose the spy ring in ex
change for immunity from prosecution, an offer that
was withdrawn in the fourth letter after the FBI had
tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting.
