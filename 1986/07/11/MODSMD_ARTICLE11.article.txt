# Achille Lauro jury names no one killer

### 
GENOA, Italy â€” Eleven men,
including the fugitive Palestinian
leader Mohammed Abu Abbas,
were convicted and sentenced yes
terday in the hijacking ot the Italian
cruise liner Achille Lauro, but none
was singled out as the murderer of
American passenger Leon Klinghof
fer.
The two judges and six jurors who
heard the three-week trial instead as
signed joint blame for the
wheelchair-bound New Yorker's kil
ling to six defendants, three of them
actual hijackers and three, including
Abbas, leaders of the Palestine
Liberation Front who were accused
of masterminding the piracy.
The 23-year-old shipboard
ringleader of the pirate-terrorists,
Youssef Molki, who retracted a pre
trial confession that he alone shot
Klinghoffer and ordered his body
and wheelchair tossed overboard,
was sentenced to 30 years imprison
ment.
Abbas, the hijacking's alleged
mastermind, and two other fugitive

Palestine Liberation Front leaders,
all tried in absentia, received life
sentences, including two months of
solitary confinement, and were or
dered to pay the equivalent of
$20,000 apiece to each of Klinghof
fer's two daughters. The 69-year-old
murdered man's widow, Marilyn,
died of cancer in February.
Court sources said they doubted
the three terrorist leaders would ever
serve their sentences or pay the
court-ordered fines.
Four of the 15 defendants in the
trial, all believed to be minor fig
ures, were acquitted.
The relatively light sentences for
most of the defendants and the un
usually forgiving reasoning of the
court as it was explained by Judge
Lino Monteverde were certain to
arouse controversy. Speaking to
reporters after the sentencing, Mon
teverde said the jury sympathetically
considered that the young hijackers
"had grown up in the tragic condi
tions which the Palestinian people
endure."
