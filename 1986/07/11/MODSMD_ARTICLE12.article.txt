Inmates' fiery escape attempt foiled
LORTON, Va. — Inmates set fire to an overcrowded prison
operated by the District of Columbia in suburban Virginia yesterday
in what the mayor termed an ill-conceived attempt at freedom.
After more than 12 hours of raging fires and fighting among inmates
— and between inmates and guards — more than 40 people had been
injured and 13 buildings set ablaze, including three dormitories offi
cials said were damaged beyond repair.
Authorities said all the facility's 4,100 prisoners were accounted for
after the incident. The prison, which has no air conditioning, was de
signed to house about 3,500 inmates. District Mayor Marion Barry Jr.
said there were 1,295 prisoners housed in the area where the trouble
broke out — about 200 over capacity.
Kennedy Space Center boss retires
WASHINGTON — Richard Smith, director of the Kennedy Space
Center, announced his retirement yesterday, continuing a shakeup of
NASA's top management in the wake of the Challenger disaster.
Smith, a 35-year veteran of the space program, was among the key
officials who approved the Jan. 28 launch of the space shuttle Chal
lenger, which disintegrated and killed the crew of seven. He will head
an aerospace company that has proposed to provide private funding for
a new shuttle.
At a news conference, Smith said he had felt no pressure from
NASA to leave. Since the accident, NASA has acquired a new ad
ministrator, a new shuttle program director and, in a previously
planned shift, a new director of the Johnson Space Center in Hous
ton. The agency has also begun to strengthen Washington
headquarters' control of far-flung operations and has set up an inde
pendent office to see that safety concerns are given more weight.
People hocks Frontier to United
NEWARK, N.J. — People Express, the discount airline struggling
for survival, rejected a $235.8 million purchase offer from Texas Air
Corp. yesterday and agreed to sell its Frontier Airlines subsidiary to
United Airlines for $146 million.
The Newark-based no-frills carrier, which has suffered because of
rapid expansion, management problems and increased competition,
bought Denver-based Frontier just eight months ago for $305 million.
Frontier Airlines has been a money-losing operation since the pur
chase, contributing $28 million to People Express' $5$ million first
quarter loss.
After two days of protracted meetings, the People Express board of
directors announced that it would sell Frontier to United for $146 mil
lion, of which $50 million will be paid next week.
