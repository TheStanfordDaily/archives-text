U.S., Cuba disagree at talks
WASHINGTON - Talks between the United
States and Cuba on reviving the suspended 1984 im
migration accord have ended in disagreement be
cause Cuba demanded the right to make radio trans
missions to this country on a scale that would be
"disruptive" to U.S. broadcasting, the State Depart
ment said yesterday.
" The Cuban side insisted on proposals that would
have required major and disruptive changes in the or
ganization of radio broadcasting in the United
States," Department Spokesman Bernard Kalb said,
revealing that the talks Tuesday and Wednesday in
Mexico City had been unsuccessful.
He added that proposals by the United States Infor
mation Agency "for implementing free competition
of ideas without interference to U.S. broadcasting"
had been rejected by Cuba. Kalb also said that no
further negotiations are anticipated at this time.
The disagreement appeared to close off any im
mediate prospects for implementing the immigration
accord under which Cuba would have taken back al
most 3,000 Cuban criminals and mental patients
who came to this country during the massive 1980
boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel. In exchange,
the United States would have agreed to accept some

3,000 former Cuban political prisoners and their
families and resume issuing immigration visas for up
to 20,000 Cubans a year.

Whites join black protest
JOHANNESBURG â€” The two main white em
ployer groups and a major black union federation
issued an unprecedented joint demand yesterday for
an end to the state of emergency and release of jailed
labor leaders.
The statement on the emergency decree marked
the first time white employers and black unions
joined in criticism of government policy, said Bobby
Godsell, a spokesman for the Federated Chamber of
Industries.
The statement came from the industry group, the
Association of Chambers of Commerce and the
Council of Unions of South Africa, the nation's
second-largest black union federation, which has
about 1 50,000 members.
South Africa's largest black union federation, the
Congress of South African Trade Unions with
500,000 members, also met with the employer
groups earlier this week, but Godsell said it declined
to join the declaration.
