The rather accidental discovery of an "oily sheen" on the surface of
Palo Alto's Matadero Creek June 26 has led to a justified community
outcry calling for a crackdown on toxic contamination at the Stanford
Industrial Park, which is owned by the University.
The Barron Park Association, which represents the residents who
border the industrial park and the creek, have devised an "action plan"
that encourages Stanford to play a more extensive role in the cleanup
project and to sponsor a symposium on toxic waste.
A disturbing number of water contaminations have occurred in the
industrial park and Barron Park area over the past years. Something is
definitely wrong. For the first time, the residents have proposed a pro
gram that might ameliorate the problem. At the very least, it is cer
tainly worth the University's time to take a serious look at the proposal.
The residents' plan calls, for searching the industrial park for any
more leaks, obtaining frequent samples of both soil and water over the
next six weeks and a full disclosure of past, present and future spills
and clean-up plans.
Residents are also encouraging Stanford to host a symposium this
October to educate both the tenants and the community about the
dangers of toxic spills. T he homeowners believe the University should
take a more active role in the oil spill and ensure the safety of the resi
dents next to their land.
As landlord of the industrial park, Stanford does have a responsibil
ity to the residents and should meet their requests. Regardless of
whether Varian Associates, the company responsible for the latest
spill, is a responsible tenant, a more comprehensive investigation of
the safety of all the plants obviously needs to be enforced.
Since the floor drain responsible for the latest leak served no func
tion and was overlooked in a recent safety inspection, one cannot help
but wonder how many more leaks might needlessly occur.
What does Stanford stand to lose by encouraging its tenants to meet
the residents' very reasonable demands? By refusing to become in
volved, the University could seriously jeopardize its favorable relations
with the surrounding community.
Although the University is clearly innocent of any wrongdoing in
this incident, for Stanford to sponsor a symposium on toxic spills
could only help Stanford-community relations and provide for an in
teresting and much needed forum.
Unfortunately, Stanford has not made any public statement recog
nizing the severity of the problem or a willingness to help in any cur
rent cleanup efforts.
We call upon Stanford University to recognize the concerns of the
Barron Park residents and promise them the safety they have every
right to expect.
