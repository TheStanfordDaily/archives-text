The recent cocaine-related deaths of two promising young athletes
are nothing short of a tragedy. There is something terribly wrong when
two men in the prime of their lives are robbed of the chance to
achieve their potential. For college basketball star Len Bias, death
came just two days after being drafted into the NBA. And Cleveland
Browns defensive back Don Rogers died days before his wedding.
We are left with the hope that they will not have died in vain
and that others will learn from their mistakes. Much information re
garding the deadly risks of cocaine has been publicized recently. The
drug is unpredictable; even a regular cocaine user taking his or her
normal dosage runs the risk of dying. It is apparent that myths con
cerning the safety of using cocaine are every bit as dangerous as the
drug itself.
But are a few articles in Time and Newsweek enough to educate the
public and prevent more deaths? And what can be done here at Stan
ford to ensure that more talent is not wasted simply because students
are ignorant of the dangers associated with each use of cocaine?
Aggressive enforcement of a "no drugs" policy by the University is
not the answer. Such a policy would only force students who use drugs
to become more secretive and make them less likely to seek help on
their own. No, the problem will not go away just because we tell it to.
The University's policy of letting individual students decide for
themselves is a sound one, but the flood of new information about
cocaine following Bias' and Rogers' deaths proves that students may
not know enough about cocaine to make an informed decision.
We applaud the University's decision to creatc a drug education
program designed to reach students before they make a costly mistake.
Certainly, a university of Stanford's caliber has the resources to make
such a project possible. Drawing from the Medical Center with its
recently expanded drug rehabilitation ccnter, the Cowell Student
Health Center and a strong Program in Human Biology, the Univer
sity should be more than capable of providing students with accurate
and comprehensible information about the health risks associated
with drug use.
Wc believe a valuable addition to this program would be a short
film about drug abuse specifically at Stanford. Interviews with Stan
ford drug abuse counselors and Stanford students who have battled
drug addiction would help convince students here that drugs are a real
problem.
While the University's program is not a perfect solution to drug
abuse, it should ensure that students here do not make a decision to
use drugs based solely 011 myths and potentially deadly untruths.
