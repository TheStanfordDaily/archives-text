# Let's give America a face-lift
## 
### 
It's been one week since the Fourth of July. And once
again, my fellow Americans, you are being called "to
think, reflect and remember" the great and wondrous
happenings of this year's extremely "special" liberty
celebration. Yes, I know this is the 20th, perhaps even
the 100 th time you have been asked to meditate on the
greatness of last weekend's celebration, the unending
network presentations and commentaries, not to men
tion the memorabilia commemorating Lady Liberty's
birthday, some of which you may still purchase today at
your local K-Mart. ("It's never too late to com-

memorate," should be a part of their ad campaign.)
The above laboriously illustrates not only the glory of
Ms. Liberty, but that of America, too. For you must un
derstand that the Lady's facelift came not from her pock
etbook, but from millions of Americans. Yes, your $5
contribution forever stands as testimony either as
shapelier eyebrows or higher cheekbones, to the solid
and generous character of U.S. citizens . Spend $5 and
become a true American — not a bad deal. And if you
played your cards right, you also received the com
plimentary glow-in-the-dark torch or a genuine plastic
replica of the Lady. Either ready for display in any
proud American home — further proof of your devotion
to Lady Liberty. But what about the ideals she espouses?
Indeed, America is the land of opportunity — provid
ing the freedom of choice that makes liberty possible.
Where else but America could a 100-year-old lady find
such steadfast support in her quest for improved beauty?
In a world in which a camera might record every stage of
your life, a centennial woman needs to photograph
well. Especially if she plans to appear on television.
just ask Christine Kraft if you don't believe me. Cxood
looks, or even just a pleasant appearance, can open
doors that would otherwise remain forever closed to
those less fortunate. Opportunity's the name and
fortune's the game. Yes, that's the way it's played in this
land of liberty. Why else do you think the Lady opted
for a facelift? Liberty for all, but more liberty for those

who look good.
That's the reason why I'd like to ask you once again,
my fellow citizens, to delve into those wallets, purses
and piggy banks, further contribute to America's beauty,
and reaffirm in the hearts of all (especially those watch
ing from abroad) that the most elusive of all dreams —
an improved face, figure, hair color, you name it — lies
within the reach of any U.S. citizen.
You see, today, just one week after the Fourth of July,
I'm celebrating my birthday. And I thought you might
find it in your hearts to give to a real live human being.
I You gave to a statue, didn't you?
No, I don't plan to spend the contributions on
fireworks, parades or tele vision coverage. Instead, your
money could multiply the opportunities- that now pres
ent themselves to rne. I would have freedom as never
before. How, you ask, will your money paint me a
brighter future? It's true that I have already cornered the
market on every beauty aid known to man. (Or should I
say woman?) But last weekend, I finally came to the
gloomy realization that these temporary (even superfi
cial supplements) fall short of being adequate.
Thus, following in the footsteps of Ms. Liberty, who
herself gave up on spot repairs for a full body treatment,
I decided that I, too, need some drastic repairs — a new
nose and perhaps a modified chin. Yes, your nickels and
dimes could assist me in enduring the next 50 years (I'm
afraid that 100 is pushing it) secure in the knowledge
that my profile will not offend the viewers eye. Uni
nhibited by my present camera shyness, I may even run
for president.
If we start today, I could be ready for filming by this
time next year. Does the slogan "Save Lisa's Face"
sound catchy enough? If you really want, we can hold a
parade (Americans do love parades) and maybe we could
find some fireworks leftover from the Fourth's celebra
tion. But please, no plastic statues or commemorative
coins, no daily broadcasts with before and after shots,
and absolutely no "What Lisa's new face means to me"
contests. ,
After all, I would like to retain some dignity through
out this affair. Unlike Ms. Liberty, you can't meld a
Teflon coating on my exterior, allowing the effects of
such degrading exploitation simply to slide right off.
The concept of a three-day birthday party intrigues me,
however. I'd be willing to keep that innovation in
celebration — only no cameras, please.

dimes could assist me in enduring the next 50 years (I'm
afraid that 100 is pushing it) secure in the knowledge
that my profile will not offend the viewers eye. Uni
nhibited by my present camera shyness, I may even run
for president.
If we start today, I could be ready for filming by this
time next year. Does the slogan "Save Lisa's Face"
sound catchy enough? If you really want, we can hold a
parade (Americans do love parades) and maybe we could
find some fireworks leftover from the Fourth's celebra
tion. But please, no plastic statues or commemorative
coins, no daily broadcasts with before and after shots,
and absolutely no "What Lisa's new face means to me"
contests. ,
After all, I would like to retain some dignity through
out this affair. Unlike Ms. Liberty, you can't meld a
Teflon coating on my exterior, allowing the effects of
such degrading exploitation simply to slide right off.
The concept of a three-day birthday party intrigues me,
however. I'd be willing to keep that innovation in
celebration — only no cameras, please.

It's been one week since the Fourth of July. And once
again, my fellow Americans, you are being called "to
think, reflect and remember" the great and wondrous
happenings of this year's extremely "special" liberty
celebration. Yes, I know this is the 20th, perhaps even
the 100 th time you have been asked to meditate on the
greatness of last weekend's celebration, the unending
network presentations and commentaries, not to men
tion the memorabilia commemorating Lady Liberty's
birthday, some of which you may still purchase today at
your local K-Mart. ("It's never too late to com-

memorate," should be a part of their ad campaign.)
The above laboriously illustrates not only the glory of
Ms. Liberty, but that of America, too. For you must un
derstand that the Lady's facelift came not from her pock
etbook, but from millions of Americans. Yes, your $5
contribution forever stands as testimony either as
shapelier eyebrows or higher cheekbones, to the solid
and generous character of U.S. citizens . Spend $5 and
become a true American — not a bad deal. And if you
played your cards right, you also received the com
plimentary glow-in-the-dark torch or a genuine plastic
replica of the Lady. Either ready for display in any
proud American home — further proof of your devotion
to Lady Liberty. But what about the ideals she espouses?
Indeed, America is the land of opportunity — provid
ing the freedom of choice that makes liberty possible.
Where else but America could a 100-year-old lady find
such steadfast support in her quest for improved beauty?
In a world in which a camera might record every stage of
your life, a centennial woman needs to photograph
well. Especially if she plans to appear on television.
just ask Christine Kraft if you don't believe me. Cxood
looks, or even just a pleasant appearance, can open
doors that would otherwise remain forever closed to
those less fortunate. Opportunity's the name and
fortune's the game. Yes, that's the way it's played in this
land of liberty. Why else do you think the Lady opted
for a facelift? Liberty for all, but more liberty for those

who look good.
That's the reason why I'd like to ask you once again,
my fellow citizens, to delve into those wallets, purses
and piggy banks, further contribute to America's beauty,
and reaffirm in the hearts of all (especially those watch
ing from abroad) that the most elusive of all dreams —
an improved face, figure, hair color, you name it — lies
within the reach of any U.S. citizen.
You see, today, just one week after the Fourth of July,
I'm celebrating my birthday. And I thought you might
find it in your hearts to give to a real live human being.
I You gave to a statue, didn't you?
No, I don't plan to spend the contributions on
fireworks, parades or tele vision coverage. Instead, your
money could multiply the opportunities- that now pres
ent themselves to rne. I would have freedom as never
before. How, you ask, will your money paint me a
brighter future? It's true that I have already cornered the
market on every beauty aid known to man. (Or should I
say woman?) But last weekend, I finally came to the
gloomy realization that these temporary (even superfi
cial supplements) fall short of being adequate.
Thus, following in the footsteps of Ms. Liberty, who
herself gave up on spot repairs for a full body treatment,
I decided that I, too, need some drastic repairs — a new
nose and perhaps a modified chin. Yes, your nickels and
dimes could assist me in enduring the next 50 years (I'm
afraid that 100 is pushing it) secure in the knowledge
that my profile will not offend the viewers eye. Uni
nhibited by my present camera shyness, I may even run
for president.
