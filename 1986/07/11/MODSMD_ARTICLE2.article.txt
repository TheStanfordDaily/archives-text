# University seeks spill cleanup

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
Although Stanford has not officially responded to
local residents' cleanup plans for the recent mineral oil
spill in Palo Alto's Matadero Creek, the University "is
prepared to push its tenants vigorously and enforce its
rights under its leases, which require tenants to comply
with all federal, state and local laws," Robin Hamill,
director of Real Estate and Lands Management for the
University, said yesterday.
Gary Simpson, vice president of Corporate Commu
nications at Varian Associates, the company responsible
for the leak, said cleanup of the spill "has been com
pleted and we are preparing a report to the Bay Area
Regional Water Quality Control Board."
Andy Doty, director of Community Relations at
Stanford, said the University believes its tenants to be

reliable and trusts Varian will clean up whatever
damage it has done.
Doty met with local residents yesterday in an effort to
"keep abreast of the issue," and will attend similar
meetings as well. A meeting is scheduled for Monday
with Jane Mickelson of the Barron Park Association, a
group of Barron Park homeowners concerned about the
spill. State and county officials will also be present at the
meeting, Doty said.
According to Simpson, the chemicals targeted in
Varian's cleanup included mineral oil, a coolant leaked
from a tank, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
which were "mysteriously" found in a storm drain.
Trichloroethylene (TCE) and trichloroethane (TCA)
were also found in the creek, but their sources are still
unaccounted for, Simpson said.
