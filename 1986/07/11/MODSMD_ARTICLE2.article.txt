# University seeks spill cleanup
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
Although Stanford has not officially responded to
local residents' cleanup plans for the recent mineral oil
spill in Palo Alto's Matadero Creek, the University "is
prepared to push its tenants vigorously and enforce its
rights under its leases, which require tenants to comply
with all federal, state and local laws," Robin Hamill,
director of Real Estate and Lands Management for the
University, said yesterday.
Gary Simpson, vice president of Corporate Commu
nications at Varian Associates, the company responsible
for the leak, said cleanup of the spill "has been com
pleted and we are preparing a report to the Bay Area
Regional Water Quality Control Board."
Andy Doty, director of Community Relations at
Stanford, said the University believes its tenants to be

reliable and trusts Varian will clean up whatever
damage it has done.
Doty met with local residents yesterday in an effort to
"keep abreast of the issue," and will attend similar
meetings as well. A meeting is scheduled for Monday
with Jane Mickelson of the Barron Park Association, a
group of Barron Park homeowners concerned about the
spill. State and county officials will also be present at the
meeting, Doty said.
According to Simpson, the chemicals targeted in
Varian's cleanup included mineral oil, a coolant leaked
from a tank, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
which were "mysteriously" found in a storm drain.
Trichloroethylene (TCE) and trichloroethane (TCA)
were also found in the creek, but their sources are still
unaccounted for, Simpson said.
Simpson and Hamill clarified that
the recorded 13 parts per million of
PCBs, a suspected cancer-causing
chemical, had been found in a
storm drain leading to the creek and
not in the creek itself. By the time
the PCBs reached the creek, they
had been significantly diluted,

Hamill explained.
Many residents, assuming the
testing had been done in the creek,
were extremely concerned about the
large number of PCBs found. The
Department of Health Services has
deemed that over seven parts per
million of PCBs poses a health risk.
Simpson speculated that the
PCBs, which are insoluble in water,
have been in the storm drain for
some time. PCB used to be a

popular chemical 10 to 15 years ago,
he said. When the mineral oil swept
through the storm drain, it took the
PCBs with it, adding to the contami
nation.
The coolant and PCBs were
leaked from Varian Building 2 in
late June. Varian has since plugged
up any drains and pipes leading to
the creek and is taking daily samples
of the water to make sure there is no
further contamination.
