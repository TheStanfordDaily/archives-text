## 'Bomb' misses reality 
### JAMES LIN Beyond the Bomb" By Mark Sommer 
The ironic, happy cartoons that open every
chapter of "Beyond the Bomb" are clear
enough to make the rest of the book seem un
necessary.
Artist Ed Koren depicts the products of dis
armament with a missile shell retired to serve
as a stylish pot for houseplants. Images of
planets smiling, generals playing tennis over
barbed wire nets and bombs bagging rays im
print the serious themes of each chapter into
the reader's mental funny bone. Mark Som-

mer's clear and urgent writing, however,
demand more than just looking at the
pictures.
The subtitle to "Beyond the Bomb" ac
curately labels it as "a field guide." For the in
experienced layman, the book is a 168-page
tour of "possibles," the alternatives to today's
fatalistic visions of nuclear deterrence and
mutually assured destruction. The most essen
tial issues behind current nuclear policy and
the options for change are simply but ac
curately identified.
Sommer leads the reader quickly and care
fully through defense and disarmament, non
violence and negotiation, futurism and peace.
He points out the important people, explains
the terms and their connected issues, presents
the most pertinent problems, and concludes
each section with a series of questions meant
to let the reader think for himself. The ex
planations often lack detail in their brevity,
but a nicely organized bibliography in the
back of the book gives references for the brave
and curious to explore on their own.
Even the brave and curious, however, will
find much to learn and digest in the text of

"Beyond the Bomb.'' The chapters are
simple, not simplistic, and like any good field
guide, they point out the flora and fauna of the
nuclear scene with an eye to their history,
their environment, and their likely future.
Sommer avoids entanglement, however, with
the nitty gritty of how these plans would oper
ate; he shows you the birds but neglects to ex
plain how to catch them.
In the chapter entitled "iNon-Violence:
Strengths of the Weak,'' Sommer explodes
some old assumptions about the uses and
limitations of non-violent defense on a na
tional scale. The author describes and sup
ports local, non-violent civilian resistance as
an effective and practical counter to nuclear
threats. He pooh-poohs current thinking
about defensible borders, offering instead the
idea of "crossroads" resistance by citizens
within those borders at each step of a hostile
invasion.
Discussing what he labels "strategic non
violence,'' Sommer compares the strategy to
the discipline of jujitsu. In each, he claims,
the non-violent actor refuses to meet the at
tacker on the physical terms of his attack. At
tacking nations find themselves in possession
of a country that yields no profit because the
civilian populations refuse to cooperate. The
anticipated frustration is in theory enough to
deter any would-be attackers.
Criticizing other groups for being over
cautious and self-preserving in their evalua
tions of options such as non-violence, Som
mer may be revealing his own set of biases for
these options. In his desire to see change and
innovation, Sommer blinds himself to many
real and practical reservations that must be
considered.
"Beyond the Bomb" is occasionally frag
mented by its many, seemingly unrelated
chapters and subsections. Koren's drawings,
however, illuminate the relationship well. His
men have converted obsolete missile shells
into useful ploughs, and his generals
have given up war for the better
game of tennis. Each section of the
book, rather than presenting the
paths that lead toward a global or
der, instead give the resulting
picture after an order is established.
"Beyond the Bomb" provides the
images of peace for which man is ex
pected to establish the reality.
The objective analyses in
"Beyond the Bomb" carry within
them an urgency, a demand for us
to believe in the feasibility of a non
nuclear world. Without such belief,
says Sommer, men lack the will
even to attempt renewal and
change.
"Where there is a will, there may
be a way," he concludes. "But
where that will is weak, the better
ways may never matter." Mark Som
mer pushes us to look farther,
beyond the Bomb, lest we be
trapped forever behind it.
