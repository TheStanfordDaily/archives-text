## NBC's overdone coverage victimizes sports viewers 
### 
Having had the good fortune to spend the
Fourth of July weekend in the hospital with
pneumonia, I had a chance to become a little
too familiar with an American institution.
No, not the Statue of Liberty — although I
was getting sick of that, too — but NBC tennis
announcer Bud Collins.
My first question is, why do they allow him
to stay on the air? Why has he been covering
something as sacred as Wimbledon for 15
years? What is the country's best sports net
work doing?

In the past I have always watched HBO
(with BBC commentary) or turned down the
sound on NBC if Collins was on. This year, I
was forced to listen to his incessant rambling,
because there was no volume control on the
hospital television. It was pure torture —
nothing an ill person should be subjected to.
Bud Collins is a tennis columnist with the
Boston Globe — again, one of the best sports
pages in America. He is not as insufferable in
print, probably because one expects sports
columnists to be somewhat obnoxious, and, of
course, you can always stop reading.
Unfortunately, a television viewer does not
have that option and must sit through hours
and hours of excessive chattering, poor at
tempts at humor, incredible exaggeration and

overuse of singularly stupid nickames. (If he
had called Boris Becker "Baron Von Slam"
once more I might have thrown an oxygen
tank through the television set.)
Collins' presence also seems to make Dick
Enberg worse than usual. Enberg always has
had a tendency to be sappy and a little over
dramatic, but during Wimbledon, he sur
passes himself. Small moments in tournament
history call for teary-eyed sentimental reflec
tion. Every match that goes more than two or
three sets is one of the greatest ever played.
The winners are the best ever, or will be some
day.
It is Collins' incredible verbosity — un
called for in a televised event — that brings
out the worst in Enberg. Perhaps Dick feels he
has to keep up with The Mouth. It's certainly a
tough job.
Collins doesn't give the listener a moment's
rest, even during play when he interjects his
infamous "oohs" and "ahs" along with his
own chuckles, winces and grunts. It's painful
to listen to. Upon a winner, he immediately
exclaims "Becker!," "Lendl!" or worse,
"Boom Boom!"
I usually find myself vainly trying to tell
him to shut up. I start off yelling, then wind
up begging, pleading, imploring and finally
just whimpering. It doesn't work. You have to
sit through three hours of Collins calling Tim
Mayotte "The Paragon of Paradise Valley" and
so on. He's even worse than Howard Cosell,
because at least Cosell said relatively intelli
gent things that made you think. Collins is just
plain ridiculous. It's not even amusing.
I feel sorry for the players, who have to put

SLUSSER
up with him the second they get off
center court, asking things like, "So
is Wimbledon Boris' backyard?" He
even looks silly in his garishly plaid,
polka dot, striped and even paisley
outfits. How do the players take him
seriously? How does anyone take
him seriously? And most important,
how does he get such great jobs?
Why do NBC and the Globe keep
him around?
A reassuring change from Bud
Collins is BBC commentator Dan
Maskill, who's been doing

Wimbledon for something like 50
years. This man does not over
whelm the viewer with useless talk,
preferring to let the action speak for
itself. He still manages to give any
necessary information and tell inter
esting and amusing stories at the
same time. Maskill never interrupts
during play and the most you'll hear
at the end of an incredible rally is a
simple "marvelous" or a typically
understated "lovely shot."
NBC should be able to do better.
They have the finest sports coverage
in the nation. Wimbledon deserves
better.
On another note, I'd like to con
gratulate columnist Erik Eselius on

his recent baseball picks. At least in
the Eastern divisions. Of course the
Red Sox will win the American
League East, as I said at the start of
the season. The addition of Tom
Seaver gives them even more experi
ence and pitching.
The Mets are the best team in
baseball. They might even be able to
beat the Sox in the World Series.
But as for the West, I wouldn't be
surprised to see the Giants win it.
All the teams in the National
League West are weak this year, so
the "kids" have a real shot, espe
cially with the addition of a veteran
like Steve Carlton. Look for Lefty to

start winning some games after
Roger Craig teaches him the split
fingered fastball.
My choice in the American
League West is the Rangers. It's an
other tossup division — they're all
pretty bad. I like the Rangers' youth,
and besides, I'm getting tired of
Kansas City. The Angels are too old
(apart from Wally Joyner) and the
Twins are too young. Plus, Texas
has two guys in the starting lineup
from my hometown (Pebble Beach)
— Pete Incaviglia and Pete O'Brien.
Former Stanford star Steve Buchele
is playing second. The one thing I'm
certain of in this division is that
Oakland will not win.
