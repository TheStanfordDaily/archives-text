## NBC's overdone coverage victimizes sports viewers 
### 
Having had the good fortune to spend the
Fourth of July weekend in the hospital with
pneumonia, I had a chance to become a little
too familiar with an American institution.
No, not the Statue of Liberty — although I
was getting sick of that, too — but NBC tennis
announcer Bud Collins.
My first question is, why do they allow him
to stay on the air? Why has he been covering
something as sacred as Wimbledon for 15
years? What is the country's best sports net
work doing?

In the past I have always watched HBO
(with BBC commentary) or turned down the
sound on NBC if Collins was on. This year, I
was forced to listen to his incessant rambling,
because there was no volume control on the
hospital television. It was pure torture —
nothing an ill person should be subjected to.
Bud Collins is a tennis columnist with the
Boston Globe — again, one of the best sports
pages in America. He is not as insufferable in
print, probably because one expects sports
columnists to be somewhat obnoxious, and, of
course, you can always stop reading.
Unfortunately, a television viewer does not
have that option and must sit through hours
and hours of excessive chattering, poor at
tempts at humor, incredible exaggeration and

overuse of singularly stupid nickames. (If he
had called Boris Becker "Baron Von Slam"
once more I might have thrown an oxygen
tank through the television set.)
Collins' presence also seems to make Dick
Enberg worse than usual. Enberg always has
had a tendency to be sappy and a little over
dramatic, but during Wimbledon, he sur
passes himself. Small moments in tournament
history call for teary-eyed sentimental reflec
tion. Every match that goes more than two or
three sets is one of the greatest ever played.
The winners are the best ever, or will be some
day.
It is Collins' incredible verbosity — un
called for in a televised event — that brings
out the worst in Enberg. Perhaps Dick feels he
has to keep up with The Mouth. It's certainly a
tough job.
Collins doesn't give the listener a moment's
rest, even during play when he interjects his
infamous "oohs" and "ahs" along with his
own chuckles, winces and grunts. It's painful
to listen to. Upon a winner, he immediately
exclaims "Becker!," "Lendl!" or worse,
"Boom Boom!"
I usually find myself vainly trying to tell
him to shut up. I start off yelling, then wind
up begging, pleading, imploring and finally
just whimpering. It doesn't work. You have to
sit through three hours of Collins calling Tim
Mayotte "The Paragon of Paradise Valley" and
so on. He's even worse than Howard Cosell,
because at least Cosell said relatively intelli
gent things that made you think. Collins is just
plain ridiculous. It's not even amusing.
I feel sorry for the players, who have to put
