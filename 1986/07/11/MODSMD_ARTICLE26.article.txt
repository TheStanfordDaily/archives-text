Anyone out there sick of Libertine
Weekend, Fernando and "mah
velous?" Rumor had it that Billy
Crystal was permanently typecast as
the worst thing appearing on
"Saturday Night Live."
Fortunately, Crystal presents an
elegant refutation in "Running
Scared" (Century 10, Redwood
Drive-In), a somewhat better,
decidedly less bloody version of a
plot that hasn't seen daylight since
"48 Hours."
In fact, the major difference be
tween this movie and "48 Hours" is
that Billy Crystal plays a funny white
guy.
Which is too bad, because he
doesn't get much of a storyline — a
euphemistic way of saying that it's
not even a variation on a theme.
Ray Hughes (Gregory Hines of
cameo fame in "Muppets Take
Manhattan") and Danny Costanzo
(Crystal) are Chicago police
detectives who've been partners for
15 years and, unpredictably, have
been the bane of their superiors due
to their usual unsanctioned methods
of bringing criminals to justice.
So when they unpredictably
stumble onto a huge drug operation
run by Julio Gonzales (Jimmy
Smits), who bears an uncanny
resemblance to the native American
escapee in "48 Hours," and acciden
tally ruin an undercover investiga
tion, their superiors allow them to
take an enforced vacation to Florida.
Logically, they decide that
barkeeping is safer than inner-city
peacekeeping, so they buy a bar and
return home, 30-day notices in
hand.

Back in Chicago, they are asked
to train a pair of replacement
detectives, who, ho ho, turn out to
be the undercover cops whose oper
ation was ruined by Hines and Crys
tal.
And there's Gonzales, who isn't
pleased about Crystal or Hines con
fiscating huge amounts of his drugs,
and is looking for a little revenge ac
tion.
But "Running Scared" is fun.
Don't expect any breakthroughs in
cinematography and you won't be
disappointed. There are exciting
chase sequences, especially the one
that starts on 1-94 and ends up on
the El, without changing cars.
There is witty repartee. Crystal
and Hines mix well, from wrangling
over who shot whom during and
after gunfights, to picking up
women in bars. The climax, which
takes place in the Illinois State
Building, results in some of the fun
niest lines heard in a firefight.
There are not so many women in
this film, but their roles define the
plot. Crystal's love interest, con
venient plot complication and po
tential hostage is ex-wife Anna
(Darlanne Fluegel), who doesn't get
to say much other than the obliga
tory "I love you," but does get to
cower a lot as the hostage.
That's better than Hines' "love"
interest, a woman whose only func
tion is to appear in bed with Hines
whenever Crystal barges in. But all
this merely serves to emphasize the
transitory, seedy and sordid life of a
Chicago cop.
"Running Scared" is for fun
(ours) and profit (theirs), which isn't
a bad combination for anyone in
volved. Pack a fifth of vodka, buy
some Sprite at the counter and go
see it.
