# Joffrey flourishes in City
## 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
Speed and agility were expected to be the primary
unifying elements among the three works danced by the
Joffrey Ballet in its mixed program Wednesday and
Saturday at the San Francisco Opera House.
But despite these similarities, the versatility for which
the company is well known was in strong evidence in
last week's performances.
Pacing itself through a piece of subtly evocative nos
talgia to one of unyielding drive, the company followed
through to its final gem by Paul Taylor, capturing a
clever but effortless exuberance.
The evening '..jgan with Assoc. Director Gerald Ar
pino's "Italian Suite," a romantic but fresh collection of
group, solo and duet dancing. In shades of fuchia and
creamy pinks, the dancers performed this piece to music
by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari and the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra. Arpino dedicated his suite to the late
Rebekah Harkness, once a major force in American Bal
let Theatre, who sponsored his first visit to Italy. He

credits Harkness as an enduring source of inspiration.
The magic of a vibrant land seen with untraveled eyes
is conveyed in the youthful simplicity and innocence
that runs the piece. Having discovered what lay in his
blood while in Italy, Arpino through the dance
demonstrates a longing for simpler ways. However, had
the piece been given less of an elegant polish, this offer
ing may well have spoken more directly and naturally to
the enchantment of young experience.
In stark contrast to the suite, the intense "Force
Field" by Laura Dean was offered as the second piece.
The 21-member ensemble all in snow white portrayed
bodies in a state of continuous motion. Their patterns
seemed to determine the direction and intensity of an
electromagnetic field in flux. The accompanying score,
Steve Reich's "Six Pianos," was a compellingly
repetitive partner to Dean's repeating choreographic
phrases.

Members of the JofFrey Ballet perform Laura Dean's "Force Field," her third dance choreographed for the com
pany. The Joffrey Ballet concludes its two week performance series this weekend at the War Memorial Opera
House with "Romeo and Juliet."
Dean's spacial patterns were an
gular, circular and jagged — always
directional, never haphazard. Ver
tiginous spins, sharp movement ac
cents and imaginatively lyrical yet

urgent passages — often performed
on the diagonal, dancer after dan
cer, pair by pair or in lines coming
forward — imparted an icy aggrava
tion.
The musicality and invention
characteristic of modern dancer
Paul Taylor resided in the con-

spicuous virtuosity of his "Arden
Court." An energetic, personable
and fluid romp to symphonic ex
cerpts by the English baroque com
poser William Boyce, the piece was
again accompanied by the San
Francisco Symphony.
The backdrop of a large, velvety
rose set against a deep, royal blue

symbolized the redolence of Taylor's
piece. The simple white costumes,
punctuated with glitter and
splotches of color, emphasized both
the airy and quirky components of
Taylor's style. Although a sense of
weightlessness pervaded, Taylor
classics of this sort remain earthy in
their boldness and wit.
