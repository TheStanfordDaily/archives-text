# Joffrey flourishes in City
## 
### CHRISTINA LEPNIS 
Speed and agility were expected to be the primary
unifying elements among the three works danced by the
Joffrey Ballet in its mixed program Wednesday and
Saturday at the San Francisco Opera House.
But despite these similarities, the versatility for which
the company is well known was in strong evidence in
last week's performances.
Pacing itself through a piece of subtly evocative nos
talgia to one of unyielding drive, the company followed
through to its final gem by Paul Taylor, capturing a
clever but effortless exuberance.
The evening '..jgan with Assoc. Director Gerald Ar
pino's "Italian Suite," a romantic but fresh collection of
group, solo and duet dancing. In shades of fuchia and
creamy pinks, the dancers performed this piece to music
by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari and the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra. Arpino dedicated his suite to the late
Rebekah Harkness, once a major force in American Bal
let Theatre, who sponsored his first visit to Italy. He

credits Harkness as an enduring source of inspiration.
The magic of a vibrant land seen with untraveled eyes
is conveyed in the youthful simplicity and innocence
that runs the piece. Having discovered what lay in his
blood while in Italy, Arpino through the dance
demonstrates a longing for simpler ways. However, had
the piece been given less of an elegant polish, this offer
ing may well have spoken more directly and naturally to
the enchantment of young experience.
In stark contrast to the suite, the intense "Force
Field" by Laura Dean was offered as the second piece.
The 21-member ensemble all in snow white portrayed
bodies in a state of continuous motion. Their patterns
seemed to determine the direction and intensity of an
electromagnetic field in flux. The accompanying score,
Steve Reich's "Six Pianos," was a compellingly
repetitive partner to Dean's repeating choreographic
phrases.
