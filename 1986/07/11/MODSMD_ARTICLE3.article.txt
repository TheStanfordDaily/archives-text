# COP has designs on new student center

### FELICIA PAIK Staff writer 
A student-run union is needed at
Stanford, and Tresidder Union is
not fulfilling this task, according to a
letter sent last week by the Council
of Presidents to Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
"Is Tresidder really a union, or is
it rather a community center?" the
letter asked. "Why does Tresidder
seem mostly geared to retail? Why is
there no student governance of stu
dents' own union?"
According to Council of Presi
dents (COP) member Carey White,
the COP and University officials
have exchanged several letters in
recent weeks discussing the possibil
ity of establishing a student-run un
ion at Stanford.
In a June letter to Lyons, the
COP outlined its case for the crea
tion of a student-run union on
campus.
"There must be a student union
that gives the openness, the loose
ness and the student-identified at
mosphere that encourages gather
ing, mixing and opcnmindedness â€”
a significant departure from what

exists now in the residential system,
in the organizational system or at
the current community center," the
letter said.
"Our main objective (by the end
of the summer) is to have a decision.
Either we must have a student un
ion or we don't. We don't want
maybe for an answer," White said.
The proposed student-run union
would be a lounge and recreation
center. It would not provide retail
services. The union would possess a
student-oriented atmosphere, rather
than the "professional atmosphere"
found at Tresidder Union, White
said.
According to White, many stu
dents feel a student-run union is ne
cessary because it is wrong for stu
dents not to have control over the
policies and activities at Tresidder
Union.
Currently, Tresidder is managed
by a University-appointed director.
Although advised by an elected
board of students, faculty and staff,
Tresidder Union director Ellie Op
penhcim runs the union and con
trols its policies, White explained.
