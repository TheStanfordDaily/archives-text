# Med Center to start infant heart transfers
## Program will be second in nation 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
Stanford Medical Center will
become the second facility in the
United States to perform infant
heart transplant surgery, as soon as a
patient and a suitable heart donor
become available, according Dr.
David Baum, chief of Pediatric Sur
gery.
The Human Subjects Committee
of the Medical Center recently ap
proved the surgical procedures in
volved in infant heart transplants,
Spiros Andreopoulos, director of
communications for the Medical
Center, said yesterday. The com
mittee's approval is necessary before
any experimental procedure can be
performed, Andreopoulos added.
Infant heart transplant surgery
"represents a logical extension of the
existing program,'' Andreopoulos
said. "It was not motivated by Loma
Linda," he added, referring to the
first-ever infant heart transplant,
which was performed on Baby Jesse
earlier this year at Loma Linda Uni
versity Medical Center in Southern
California. He noted that
transplants on adults have been per
formed at the Stanford Medical
Center for 25 years.
"As the program progressed and
we got more experienced, it was
logical to extend the age limit on
both sides," said Andreopoulos, add
ing that heart transplants have been
performed on a gallery of people,
from a 64-year-old man to a two
and-one-half year old girl.
The experimental aspect of infant
transplants is the effect of im
munosuppressants — drugs used to
combat rejection of a transplanted
organ — on infants, Baum ex
plained.

"What will happen when the
child is immunized for something
like whooping cough is unknown,''
added Baum.
"With new immunosuppressant
drugs, especially cyclosporin, being
used and new findings in research,''
it was not surprising that the Medi
cal Center entered the infant
transplant field, said Andreopoulos.
He added the surgery would be per
formed only when alternate forms of
treatment had failed.
According to Baum, surgeons in
volved in the transplant program put
"the icing on the cake" by consult
ing colleagues on the Medical Cen
ter's Ethics Committee, even after
the Human Subjects Committee
had issued approval of the transplant
procedure.
"As an effort to protect the human
subject, particularly because the
subject is a minor, we have to bend
over backwards to protect the child
and the child's family," Baum ex
plained.
There have been 31 transplants
performed at the Medical Center on
patients 19 years old or younger
since 1974, and of those, 21 have
survived, Andreopoulos said.
"We get five or six queries a year"
for heart transplant surgery involv
ing congenital defects, said
Andreopoulos. He added that he was
not aware of any new requests for
surgery resulting from the recent
publicity surrounding infant heart
transplant surgery.
The approved transplant proce
dure will not require any new
facilities, but "it will require partici
pation of people in the Neo-Natal
Department," which will necessitate
more coordination between depart
ments at the Medical Center, he
said.
