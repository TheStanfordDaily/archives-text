# Doctors fix hearts in new lab

A heart patient lies quietly, attached to a maze of
wires in a darkened laboratory. A few feet away, a
doctor operates a large electronic console, sending
precisely-timed electrical impulses to stimulate spe
cific areas of the patient's heart.
After trying many combinations, the doctor finds
what he's looking for. The heart rate monitor surges
from 100 to 180 beats per minute, and the electrocar
diogram (EKG) pen recorder flutters wildly. Within
seconds the patient's heartbeat returns to normal.
This procedure, which sometimes lasts eight
hours, is performed daily in Stanford's new electrop
hysiology laboratory, opened last month at the Medi
cal Center. The facility provides "state-of-the-art"
care for patients with arrhythmias, or abnormal
heartbeats, said Dr. Charles Swerdlow, director of
the unit. Stanford purchased the laboratory equip
ment at a cost of more than $500,000 as part of the
hospital's modernization project.
Abnormal heartbeats are caused by disturbances in
the electrical conduction system of the heart. They
may be too rapid (tachycardias) or too slow
(bradycardias) in either the upper or lower portions of
the heart. If they are sufficiently serious the heart
cannot pump effectively â€” and the patient can die of
a sudden heart attack.
Patients suffering from abnormal heartbeats
usually have had a previous heart attack that
damaged the heart's conduction system. Some ar
rhythmias are born with extra electrical conduction
pathways in the heart, a condition called Wolff-

Parkinson-White syndrome.
Symptoms of arrhythmias include palpitations,
fainting or even cardiac arrest.
Electrophysiology studies, or E-P for short, pro
vide a means "to identify people at risk of developing
arrhythmias and to prevent them from happening,"
Swerdlow said. E-P involves the insertion of long
wires, called catheters, into the large arteries of the
neck or groin. Using X-ray visualization, a doctor
guides the catheters into the patient's pumping heart.
The catheters are connected to an electronic
console, which allows the doctors to record impulses
traveling inside the heart, a technique called
"mapping" the heart. The equipment can also
deliver precisely-timed elcctrical stimuli to specific
portions of the heart, a technique called "pacing" the
heart.
The doctors search for the source of the abnormal
heartbeat by trying to artificially trigger one.
The procedure would be dangerous without the
many precautions exercised in the lab. "Building
safety into the lab is our number one consideration,"
Swerdlow said. "We have two defibrillators, and the
EKG is displayed on five screens. Every system is
redundant for safety."
Once the doctors have determined the mechanism
of the patient's arrhythmia, they can use E-P to test
the effectiveness of drugs or to identify which parts of
the heart are candidates for surgery. They can even
treat some arrhythmias right in the lab. Doctors
deliver a localized electrical shock inside the patient's
