# Western Culture changes begin
## Dean Lougee urges increased minority representation 
### MORRIE RATNER Staff writer 
Several projects designed to improve and update the
Western Culture Program have just recently gotten un
derway, according to faculty members participating in
the planning.
Assoc. History Prof. Clayborne Carson, with assis
tance from other faculty and students, is designing a
possible course option that will incorporate the contri
butions of women and minorities in Western culture
into the program.
Plans for the course are still in the developmental
stage, Carson said.
History graduate student Katherine Weinert and An
thropology Prof. Renato Rosaldo are working closely
with Carson, who said he is consulting other faculty
members as well.
"We're really just beginning to do any work,"
Weinert said. "The course is just in its beginning
stages." She added that the course will be more of a
"world culture" than a Western culture course.
If approved by the Faculty Senate next fall, the alter
nate course option could be offered to freshmen as early
as spring quarter next year. It would be open to all tracks
of the current Western Culture Program.
In a related project, Classics Prof. Mark Edwards,
who currently heads the Faculty Senate's Western Cul
ture Program Committee, is working on a bibliography
of material concerning issues of women and minorities.
The bibliography will be distributed to Western Culture
instructors in the fall.
Edwards said he is "hitting up" several people to work
on the project with him, and he expects to have some
material available by September.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn Lougee said
a task force on the Western Culture Program will be
created soon. In a presentation before the Faculty Sen
ate June 12, Lougee said "the Committee on Under
graduate Studies has requested that the provost establish
a task force (on the Western Culture Program), and the
provost has agreed to do so."
Because Provost James Rosse has been away from
campus recently, he has not had time to work on estab
lishing the task force, Lougee said yesterday.
Rosse was unavailable for comment.
History Prof. Paul Robinson, incoming chairman of
the Western Culture Policy Committee, said the slow
start of the various Western Culture projects is due to

the fact that "not much goes on in the summer because
everyone's away.''
In her June 12 presentation, LougQe responded to
some of the recent criticism of the Western Culture
courses as they exist now, and stressed the need to
scrutinize the Western Culture Program.
The program "has recently been subject to a powerful
critique, emanating from concerned faculty, many of
whom teach in the program, and from students, espe
cially minority students," Lougee said in her presenta
tion.
Minority students "have lamented the 'Euro-centric
perspective' of the courses on the grounds that this per
spective 'implies that the study of non-European
cultures and people is insignificant,' " she told the Fac
ulty Senate.
"They have charged that 'the unwarranted glorifica
tion of one culture over another insults those not of a
European background' and that the courses constitute
'biases,' 'misrepresentations' and, in some, 'white ethnic
studies,' " Lougee added.
No one intends bias in teaching Western culture, she
said in her speech. "So much attention is devoted in
these courses to criticizing the ethics and actions of the
European past that the charge of 'glorification ' is diffi
cult to comprehend," Lougee said.
In addition, Lougee added, critics of the Western
Culture Program often attack "a caricature of, rather
than a likeness to, the courses actually being taught."
She said, however, that critics' concerns are generally
legitimate, and that they point to a cluster of issues
having to do with the implications of political, social
and intellectual changes that have occurred over the
past half century.
The submergence of the Atlantic community under
the world community, the opening up of college educa
tion to irjinoritics, and the acknowledgment over the
past two decades of the importance of studying the con
tribution of women and minorities to Western culture
have necessitated a re-examination of the program,
Lougee said.
"To me, it seems easily believable that the exclusive
focus on European culture reinforces the sense of mar
ginality and discomfort of the newest arrivals on Ameri
can campuses," she said. "A new model of a shared
freshman culture course needs to be invented to serve
the more diversified population that is now on our
campus and in the country's future."

Minority students "have lamented the 'Euro-centric
perspective' of the courses on the grounds that this per
spective 'implies that the study of non-European
cultures and people is insignificant,' " she told the Fac
ulty Senate.
"They have charged that 'the unwarranted glorifica
tion of one culture over another insults those not of a
European background' and that the courses constitute
'biases,' 'misrepresentations' and, in some, 'white ethnic
studies,' " Lougee added.
No one intends bias in teaching Western culture, she
said in her speech. "So much attention is devoted in
these courses to criticizing the ethics and actions of the
European past that the charge of 'glorification ' is diffi
cult to comprehend," Lougee said.
In addition, Lougee added, critics of the Western
Culture Program often attack "a caricature of, rather
than a likeness to, the courses actually being taught."
She said, however, that critics' concerns are generally
legitimate, and that they point to a cluster of issues
having to do with the implications of political, social
and intellectual changes that have occurred over the
past half century.
The submergence of the Atlantic community under
the world community, the opening up of college educa
tion to irjinoritics, and the acknowledgment over the
past two decades of the importance of studying the con
tribution of women and minorities to Western culture
have necessitated a re-examination of the program,
Lougee said.
"To me, it seems easily believable that the exclusive
focus on European culture reinforces the sense of mar
ginality and discomfort of the newest arrivals on Ameri
can campuses," she said. "A new model of a shared
freshman culture course needs to be invented to serve
the more diversified population that is now on our
campus and in the country's future."
