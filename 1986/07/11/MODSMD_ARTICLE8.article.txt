# Reagan Library site spurs local petition
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
Preparations for the construction
of the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library at Stanford are proceeding
despite threats of a petition from a
neighborhood coalition.
The Stanford Foothills Residents
Group, a committee of homeowners
who live near the library's planned
site, will put out a petition voicing
the residents' concerns on the issue,
said Education Prof. Robert Bush, a
member of the group's executive
committee.
Bush cited the proposed location
of the library, increased traffic along
Junipero Serra Boulevard and the
general development of the foothills
as the main topics of the group's pe
tition.
Bush said he expects the petition
to be written and sent to the
"appropriate officials, hopefully
soon."
The homeowners charge that the
University has apparently dis
regarded a previous plan for the de
velopment of the foothills that does
not include the construction of the
Reagan Library, according to Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Anthony
Siegman. The plan is being
prepared by the Foothills Region
Plan Working Group, a University
appointed committee, said Sieg
man, another member of the
homeowner group's executive com
mittee.
"This plan (for the development
of the foothills) is by no means com

plete," said Siegman. "One of the
main points of contention is that the
Ronald Reagan Library was not part
of the plan. ... It was just stuck
there on a prime piece of land."
"We haven't yet applied for a
building permit," said Hoover Insti
tution Archivist Charles Palm, who
serves as the liaison for planning be
tween the University and the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation.
Once the license agreement — a
document that spells out the condi
tions for the use of the site — is
"signed and sealed," the application
will be made to Santa Clara County,
and an environmental impact report
will be commissioned, Palm said.
Palm said the University's Ronald
Reagan Library Planning Commit
tee would take into "careful consid
eration (any petition) on the library
or any aspect of it, as we have been
doing for the past three years."
"We want to ensure the integra
tion of the library with the campus,"
he concluded.
Because the library site will no
longer be University property under
the terms of the licensing agree
ment, the library will never be con
sidered a part of the University, said
Siegman.
"It's not something that the Uni
versity will be able to remove or
change," he said.
The library, which is scheduled to
open in January 1989 to coincide
with the end of Reagan's term in of
fice, will cost approximately $30
million to build.
