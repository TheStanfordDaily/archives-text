# ASSU continues divestment

### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
The ASSU Summer Finance Committee finalized
plans Tuesday for transferring its funds out of
University-managed pools, which include invest
ments in companies that do business in South Africa.
The ASSU's other summer standing committee,
the Policy and Procedures Committee, also met last
week to discuss ways to fill openings on various
ASSU and University committees to which the sen
ate may appoint or recommend student representa
tives.
At its meeting Tuesday evening, the Finance
Committee decided to reinvest its money market
funds in the Capital Preservation Fund 11, a Palo
Alto-based fund that invests only in U.S. Treasury
notes, according to ASSU Graduate Senator Eric
Berg. Previously, these funds were managed by the
University through its Expendable Funds Pool.
Last spring the senate elected to transfer its mutual
fund holdings, approximately $650,000, from the
University's Merged Investment Pool B into Calvert's
Managed Growth Fund, a Maryland mutual fund
with no investments in South Africa. Both financial
transfers will be conducted Aug. 1.
The senate voted last spring to divest all ASSU
holdings from University-managed funds because the
University owns shares of companies doing business
in apartheid-ruled South Africa.
Currently, some student organizations hold ac

counts with the ASSU Financial Office. These ac
counts, totaling approximately $700,000, will
remain with the University funds until the organiza
tions deliver instructions to divest, according to
ASSU Financial Manager Mariah Dickson.
The Policy and Procedures Committee faces some
problems of communication in its effort to fill the
ASSU's vacant committee seats.
According to ASSU Senate Chair Jeff Soukup, stu
dents must be formally nominated in order to be con
sidered for appointment, but there have been com
munication problems between the senate and its
nominations committee.
Currently, the senate does not know if the
nominations committee from last spring has con
ducted interviews for all the available openings,
Soukup said.
According to Soukup, the senate is anxious to fill
positions on three committees: the Trustee Commit
tee on Finance and Administration, one of the stand
ing committees of the Board of Trustees; the Stanford
judicial Council, a University committee that hears
cases of students who have been accused of violating
the fundamental standard or the Honor Code; and
the Tresidder Union Board, an advisory board for the
governance of Tresidder Union.
The Trustee Committee on Finance and Adminis
tration, which has two openings, is one of the two
major standing committees of the board, according to
Berg. One of its duties is to review the University
budget.
