# Miller gets two life sentences
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES - Described
by a federal judge as a "tormented
man" whose biggest problem is in
gratitude, former FBI agent Rich
ard Miller was sentenced yesterday
to two concurrent life prison terms
for espionage and another 50 years
on four other related spy charges.
The sentence imposed by U.S.
District judge David Kenyon on
the first FBI agent ever charged
with espionage followed the re
commendation of government
prosecutors, and the judge made
clear his feelings that Miller
should never be paroled from
prison.
"It seems to me that anyone
who deliberately, for their own
personal gain, betrays their
country, should not walk again in
his country as a free man,"
Kenyon said.
Kenyon's lengthy comments
before sentencing the former
member of the FBl's Los Angeles
Soviet counterintelligence squad
ended almost 22 months of occa
sionally chaotic and sometimes
even comical courtroom proceed
ings in one of the most bizarre spy
cases in U.S. history.
Miller, 49, an excommunicated
Mormon and father of eight with a
bungled 20-year FBI career, was
convicted of passing FBI secrets to
the Soviet KGB during an adul
terous affair in 1984 with Svetlana
Ogorodnikova, an emotionally

troubled Russian emigre, who also
was convicted of spying for the
Soviets.
Although Miller's trial and the
earlier trial of Ogorodnikova and
her husband, Nikolai, often
focused on Miller's sexual es-

capades and his penchant for
blunders, Kenyon seized the occa
sion of Miller's sentencing to dis
cuss the "lesson" to be learned
from the former FBI agent's case.
" This case has been a tremen
dous lesson to the court," said
Kenyon. "As a boy, my mother
used to constantly refer to being
grateful when I complained about

some things. The fundamental
trouble Miller had was he did not
appreciate that. Because he had
everything.
"He had eight children he
helped bring into this world, the
privilege of watching them grow.
He had a full family — to some
the biggest blessing of all.
"He had a wife who stuck by
him. He had his church. He had
superiors in the FBI whom he
resented, but he should have been
very grateful for the way they
treated him. He had a position of
respect and a rare opportunity of
service to his government.
"If Mr. Miller had been grateful
enough for any one of those
things, he would not be here
today," Kenyon said.
Miller was charged Oct. 2,
1984, with passing FBI secrets to
the Soviet KGB. His 1 awyers,
portraying him as a pathetic
bumbler, had advised him against
testifying during his own two spy
trials that finally ended in his con
viction June 19. His earlier trial
ended in a deadlock-mistrial.
Moments before he was sen
tenced yesterday, the former agent
broke his courtroom silence —
against his lawyers' advice — to
proclaim his innocence and
deliver a rambling speech on what
lie described as the lack of justice
in the courts, differentiating be
tween the laws of God and men.
