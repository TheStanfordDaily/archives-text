## Black may be sent as envoy to Pretoria

WASHINGTON - The Reagan
Administration, in the midst of a
policy review on South Africa, is
considering the appointment of a
black businessman as U.S. Ambas
sador to that troubled country to
symbolically underscore President
Reagan's opposition to apartheid,
Administration officials said yester
day.
Current Ambassador Herman
Nickel is due in Washington today
to participate in the review, which is
searching for ways to bring about
peaceful reform without abandoning
the controversial concept of
"constructive engagement."
Administration sources confirm
that Nickel is not expected to return
to his post, and that Robert Brown,
51, a public relations and manage
ment consultant from North
Carolina, is the leading contender to
replace Nickel.
"The appointment of a black to
this particular job would in itself be
a powerful message to the Botha
government," said one source,
speaking on condition he not be
identified. The Administration's
policy assessment was fueled by
Reagan's frustration with South
African President Pieter Botha's
refusal last month to lift the current
state of emergency. The lifting
would allow blacks to commemorate
the 10th anniversary of the riots in
the black township of Soweto.

Brown's nomination would be
unassailable on Capitol Hill, this
source added. While he is closely
allied with civil rights leaders like
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Atlanta
Mayor Andrew Young, he also wins
high praise from such conservative
leaders as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.).
Helms, the ranking majority
member of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions committee, was described by a
staff aide, Cliff Kiracoffe, as a friend
and admirer of Brown. Kiracoffe
said Brown had worked with Helms
on Republican party matters in
North Carolina.
Young, a friend of Brown's from
their days in the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, issued a
statement saying that "I cannot
think of anybody more qualified to
represent this country in a difficult
situation." Young recalled that
Brown had served in the White
House during Richard Nixon's Ad
ministration. "Unlike blacks in the
Ronald Reagan White House, he
really represented blacks well,"
Young added.
A State Department official said
that possible successors to Nickel
had been under consideration for
some time. Nickel has been in the
tense post since April 1982. Because
a normal tour of duty is three years,
he is regarded as overdue for rota
tion.
