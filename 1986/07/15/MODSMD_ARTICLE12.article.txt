Shuttle launch delayed until '88
WASHINGTON — NASA officials yesterday announced that the
next shuttle launch will be delayed another six months, until at least
early 1988, because of unexpected difficulties with the redesign of the
flawed solid rocket booster that caused the Challenger disaster.
The announcement, which could worsen the backlog of commer
cial, scientific and military payloads and mean more layoffs in the
space program, came in a report to President Reagan yesterday. The
report outlined the agency's plans to implement the Rogers Commis
sion s recommendations for overhauling the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and fixing booster problems.
Along with the report, according to a White House source, NASA
Administrator James Fletcher handed the president a personal appeal
for his support in building a fourth orbiter to replace Challenger,
which disintegrated jan. 28, killing its crew of seven. The White
House has been unable to resolve the divisive question of how to pay
for the proposed $2.8 billion spacecraft.
White House officials have said a final decision will take at least two
weeks.
X-ray contra aid plan, Cranston says
WASHINGTON — Congress should investigate the Reagan Ad
ministration s relationship with the anti-Sandinista rebels in the wake
of reports that the Administration is preparing to take control of the
rebel fight against Nicaragua's leftist government, Sen. Alan Cranston
said yesterday.
'This could be a rerun of Vietnam," Cranston (D-Calif.) told
reporters at a news conference. "First American money, then Ameri
can advisers, then American control of the war, then American
troops."
Cranston's call came in the wake of weekend newspaper reports that
the Administration will take over responsibility for managing the mili
tary operations of the contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista
government.
According to the reports, the State Department will set overall
policy while the CIA will oversee day-to-day operations.
Fall will see computer-age lotto
SACRAMENTO — The clerks huddled like casino gamblers
around a dozen lotto terminals, logging bets amid an electronic sym
phony of clicks and whirs that will soon spread throughout California.
The state-run lottery plans by September to offer the new computer
ized generation of games, which will feature jackpots that experts say
could approach $100 million.
Training sessions also are being conducted at eight other sites from
San Diego to Sacramento, according to officials of GTECH Corp.,
the Rhode Island firm that won a $121 million contract to supply lotto
equipment. Up to about 900 people a day will be taught how to use
the computer terminals during the next five to six weeks.
