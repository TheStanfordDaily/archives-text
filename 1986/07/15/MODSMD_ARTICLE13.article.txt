Pakistan may have A-bomb
WASHINGTON — The United States and the
Soviet Union have engaged in some nnpiiblicized
tough talk the past month over growing indications
that Pakistan's unclear program has moved far along
the path toward production of an atomic bomb, ac
cording to Administration sources.
The discussion was generated by a direct and un
nsnally tough Soviet warning to Pakistan about its
nuclear activities, the sources said, including a
charge that the Pakistanis are on the verge of con
structing a nuclear bomb, which Moscow indicated it
would not tolerate.
The Reagan Administration, upon learning of the
warning, responded with its own private message to
Moscow reiterating the strong U.S. commitment to
Pakistan's security. One official described the U.S.
message as extremely grave and said that Washing
ton, in effect, told Moscow to keep "hands off' Pakis
tan, which borders Afghanistan.
Nuke watch site planned
MOSCOW — A team of Soviet scientists is plan
ning to open a monitoring site for U.S. nuclear tests
in Nevada later this year, American and Soviet scien
tists announced here yesterday. The new site is a
response to last week's startup of a privately organized
U.S. nuclear monitoring station near Karakaralinsk,
Kazakstan, and will give the Soviet Union the capa
bility to review U.S. nuclear tests on American soil
for the first time.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, with
offices in Washington and New York, and the Soviet
Academy of Sciences signed an agreement last May

to send teams of scientists to one another's countries
to oversee nuclear testing. Their aim is to demon
strate that a nuclear test ban is verifiable.
But some of the U.S. environmentalists who in
itiated the unprecedented exchange of nuclear
monitors have cast doubts on whether Moscow will
follow through on its end of the deal.
Soviet scientists are more interested in analyzing
earthquake data than in measuring U.S. tests, said
Thomas Cochran, senior scientist at the Natural Re
sources Defense Council and originator of the ex
change. He added that development of a seismologi
cal research program to review such data is still
tentative.
But Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, dismissed doubts about Mos
cow's commitment to the project, which were raised
in a press conference here yesterday.
Apartheid protest disunited
JOHANNESBURG - Tens of thousands of black
workers shunned jobs and schools yesterday to protest
South Africa's state of emergency, but the main effect
appeared to be in areas noted for anti-apartheid activ
ism.
The government said at least 80 percent of the na
tion's 1.7 million black students returned to school
for resumption of classes after a six-week vacation.
That would mean up to 340,000 stayed away in
response to a call from militant youth leaders.
Black trade unions proclaimed a national "day of
action" against the detention of more than 200 labor
leaders.
Only scattered strikes occurred in most parts of the
country, however.
