After a long year of disciplining a fraternal system plagued with be
havioral problems, Residential Education has once again been forced
to spend its valuable time punishing a fraternity for its wrongdoings.
Res Ed has charged the Delta Upsilon fraternity with almost
$20,000 in damages to the DU house. Sadly, this is nothing new.
Res Ed has spent untold man hours investigating and deciding how
to punish fraternities and sororities that break the rules. The fact that
the University must constantly police the fraternity system is embar
rassing, but even worse, it is becoming apparent that this policing is
also keeping Res Ed from accomplishing some of its higher goals.
When Joe Pisano first took a position with Res Ed as fraternal affairs
adviser, he brought with him many ideas for improving the Greek sys
tem here. Unfortunately, he hasn't been able to accomplish his goals
because he has been distracted by the time-consuming task of penaliz
ing fraternities and sororities.
After a year of dealing with the situation, Pisano has said that there
is a need to free himself and the rest of Res Ed from the burden of
having to be a disciplinarian so much of the time.
Res Ed's duties naturally include disciplining fraternities and
sororities when necessary, but we feel that its top priority should al
ways be educating and advising students through programming. Cer
tainly, it is not too much to ask that Res Ed have the time it needs to
pursue innovative programming ideas that would benefit the entire
student body.
I o give Pisano and the rest of Res Ed this chance to accomplish its
goals, the University needs to create a new mechanism for disciplining
fraternities and sororities. Plans are underway to create an all-Greek
council comprised of students that would address such issues as dis
cipline problems in the fraternal system. Pisano calls the new council
a good start, and we agree.
It is imperative, however, that this group get beyond a good start. It
must eventually shoulder the burden of discipline in the Greek sys
tem. Res Ed could continue to oversee the process, but the bulk of the
responsibility would rest with the new council, leaving Res Ed with
more time to focus more of its energies on its primary mission —
educating students in their residences.
