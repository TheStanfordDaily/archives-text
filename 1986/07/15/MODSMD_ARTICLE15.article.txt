# Meese's mistake

U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese's report on pornography
hasn't hit The New York Times bestseller list yet, but business has
been booming at the federal government bookstores.
Released last week, the 1,968-page report is the culmination of a
year's work by the 11-member Attorney General's Commission on
Pornography. The document includes an alphabetized list of 2,325
magazines, 725 books and 2,370 films. It also contains scene-by-scene
descriptions of such films as "Debbie Does Dallas," "Biker Slave
Girls" and " The Devil and Miss Jones."
But does the attorney general's report, which cost taxpayers
$500,000, have any value other than to satisfy the curious about the
latest in porn?
Unfortunately not. Although the commission contends that some
forms of pornography cause "anti-social acts of sexual violence," its
conclusions are hardly reliable. Six of the 11 commissioners are self
proclaimed "smutbustcrs;" from the onset, the commission was more
concerned with satisfying conservative fundamentalists than finding
the true effects of pornography on society. Clearly, the panel's 92
recommendations urging a crackdown on pornography were preor
dained. It would have been much simpler for the panel to brainstorm
the guidelines a year ago without having to spend half a million dollars
to conduct an "investigation."
The commission conducted no original research, and.its findings
were based on little scientific data. The panel heard testimony from
208 witnesses, including 68 policemen, 30 "victims" and 14 represen
tatives of anti-pornographv organizations. It also took field trips to
adult bookstores. As U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson, chairman of the
commission, admitted at a press conference, commission members
weighed uncorroborated testimony and used "common sense" to link
pornographic materials to violent behavior. The commission couldn't
even agree on a definition of what constitutes pornography.
But besides the bias of these "fact-finding" methods, the commis
sion's most disturbing action came last February, when the panel's ex
ecutive director wrote to a number of large companies informing them
that the commission had "received testimony alleging that your com
pany is involved in the sale or distribution of pornography" and threat
ening to name them in the commission's final report.
A few weeks later, Southland Corp., the company that operates 7-
Eleven convenience stores, removed Playboy and Penthouse
magazines from their shelves. The commission did not name specific
companies in its final report, and Playboy and Penthouse weren't even
included in the list of offensive magazines, but the damage was
already done.
When delving into the sensitive issue of censorship, the govern
ment must act on the basis of evidence, not on intuition, as this com
mission has done.
There is no doubt that sexual violence and its hazy link to pornogra
phy is a valid concern worthy of investigation. But this commission
ends up working against its own aim. The report is so one-sided it is of
fensive â€” it lacks any semblance of credibility. The Administration
should simply start all over again, shell out another half-million dol
lars, and this time come up with a commission with a few more scien
tists, a lot less fundamentalism and a lot more conclusive evidence.
