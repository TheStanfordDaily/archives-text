Live from New York . . .
Lady Liberty's first name is "Vicki," David Letterman
announced during his opening monologue last week. As
my plane circled La Guardia Airport, I stared through
the window at the torch-wielding figure in the harbor
and tried to get an idea of her personality, the face that
welcomed thousands of immigrants, the fortitude that
weathered 100 years of crises throughout America.
Hmm . . . maybe "Buffy."

I'm here in New York looking for a job, although
New York seems indifferent to this. Humid heat seems
to have aged everything and everyone since last time I
was here in Manhattan (as it says in the Bible, "there is
nothing new under the sun"). Last week's joyous fes
tivities are only a half-believed rumor: I've arrived even
later than those Polish sailors.
Why is New York so great? The question assumes
much. I asked my grandfather, a New York resident for
52 years, why he has never moved out of the city. He
rubbed his chin.
"Maybe I should,'' he said thoughtfully.
Simon and Garfunkel, proud New Yorkers them
selves, enjoyed great success with their Central Park
concert in 1980. Years before that, they sold the city's 8
million inhabitants countless copies of "Bridge Over
Troubled Water." The song has a simple enough
message: an offer of friendship, no strings attached. It
must have secretly touched a void within the people
who comprise New York's masses, thronging on the
streets and sidewalks, crammed together. Yet so many
seem so alone, faces hardened suspiciously.
The friendliest stranger I encountered was a bum in
Greenwich Village who approached a cafe table where I
sat with friends and boisterously sang 20 seconds of
"Strangers in the Night" before he was shooed away by
the proprietor.

We were a party of five that evening, periodically
squeezing ourselves (illegally) into single taxis. I had for
gotten that traffic laws are optional here. I can't decide
whether New York cabbies are the best or the worst
drivers in the world. Woody Allen, a man who loves this
place more than anyone I can think of, once said that
California's only cultural advantage was that motorists
can turn right on a red light. But I think now they do
that here, too. At least our cab drivers did.
Note: How can anyone sleep in New York? Twenty
four-hour-a-day traffic makes traffic noises; city lights
make the night sky perpetually the color of dawn.
Hrmph.
But New York contains the best and the worst of any
city, pressed perversely together. The New York Times
(the world's greatest newspaper), located on a few floors
of a modest gray building, sits across the street from a
porno movie theater; beautiful Central Park houses a
wino on every fifth bench. Luxurious hotels and apart
ment duplexes stand alongside crumbling brick build
ings. It is a city of never-ending interest, even when one
would rather just rest.

It's a city of never-ending
interest.

I came here last year with my father, a native New
Yorker. During a stroll through the park, he pointed out
places where he and childhood friends had played
baseball or sailed toy ships on the boat pond near Fifth
Avenue (a place immortalized for me in E.B. White's
"Stuart Little"). How different it must have been from
my quiet Palo Alto upbringing.
But how different, I am told, the city itself used to be.
One of my four companions (about my age) on my out
ing Friday night spent much time praising this city and
insisting 1 move to the East Coast and experience for
myself the "magical energy of New York." But he ended
his praises on a more somber note.
"I will never raise my kids here," he said. "Not in the
New York of today."
