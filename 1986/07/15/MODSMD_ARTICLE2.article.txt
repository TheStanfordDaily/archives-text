# Chappie diploma withheld
## Pie-throwing at ASSU Senate meeting sparks complaint 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
A student said yesterday that his diploma was with
held as a result of an altercation between some ASSU
senators and members of the Chaparral at the final sen
ate meeting last quarter.
Ron Herbst, last year's Chaparral editor, said his di
ploma has been put on hold pending an investigation of
the May 28 incident in which several members of the
Chaparral staff entered a meeting of the ASSU Senate
and threw whipped cream pies at the senators.
"I was really upset, what can I say?" Herbst said, add
ing he was particularly upset by the administration's ac
tions after the incident.

"I was never told how serious the matter was," he
said. "I was never told that my diploma was in
jeopardy."
He said he talked with Sally Cole, University judicial
affairs officer, as soon as he heard a complaint had been
filed. "(The Chaparral members named in the com
plaint) found out about it a week and a half afterwards,"
he said.
Cole said it was University policy not to discuss com
plaints under investigation.
The complaint was filed by Graduate Senator Jim
DeLaHunt, who sent a letter two days after the incident
to Cole demanding that the University "investigate and
prosecute the members of the Hammer and Coffin Soci
ety (the Chaparral) for violations of the Policy on
Campus Disruptions. '' DeLaHunt could not be reached
for comment.
In his letter, DeLaHunt wrote that "the University
business they disrupted, the pattern of chronic mis
behavior this (incident) crowns, the personal hurt they
inflicted and the institutional nature of the attack are
very important issues.
"It is the same sort of degradation inherent in words
like 'nigger' and 'faggot'," the complaint continued. "It
hurts, and it hurts bad.
"I submit that disruption of a student-run University
function is equally serious, and that insult and degrada
tion on the basis of organizational affiliation is equally
offensive and wounding," DeLaHunt concluded.
"She (Cole) made it seem like a light matter," Hcrbst
continued. "I said to her, 'I want to graduate, and she
said, 'Don't worry about it.' " He added that the first in
dication he received that he would not receive his

degree was the day before Commencement when Cole
told him that he was "definitely not" getting his di
ploma.
Herbst said that he received a letter from Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Diana Conklin, who is involved in
the University investigation, outlining possible penalties
he may face.
"Certain parts of the penalties are not listed in [the
University's Regulations Governing Student Conduct],"
he added.
"Senator after senator came out and told us that they
didn't mind," said junior Jim Suhre, business manager
of the Chaparral. "Jim (DeLaHunt) was on the edge of
tears. We couldn't believe they were taking it this hard."
The case is still under review and no quick resolution
is expected, said Council of Presidents member Carey
White, who was ASSU Senate Chair at the time of the
incident.
Besides Herbst, DeLa Hunt's letter also names junior
Josh Weinstein and sophomore Joe Dew as "assailants."
Police were called to the Law School, where the
meeting was held, after fights broke out between mem
bers of the senate and some of the pie-throwers, but no
criminal charges were filed.
