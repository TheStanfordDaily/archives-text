## Ashland: a natural, new-world hamlet 
### MARK LAWRENCE KAREN MARANGI 
"O brave new world that has such
people int."
It may not be an entirely different
world, but if you're looking for an
exciting summer weekend full of
magic, romance and comedy, Ash
land, Ore. is a great choice.
It's no farther away than Los An
geles, and — best of all — it's the
home of the Oregon Shakespearean
Festival, an eight-month celebration
of drama offering everything from
the most classic of Shakespeare's
works to the most unconventional of
modern plays.
The sophistication and culture of
San Francisco combine with the
natural beauty of the Cascade
Mountains to produce an ideal set
ting for a weekend away from
campus or an extended vacation.
Crater Lake and Mt. Lassen Na
tional Parks, Mt. Shasta and several
national and state forests arc all
within an easy few hours' drive of
the festival.
Where else could a traveler camp
in the shadow of snowcapped moun
tains, hike along endless wooded
trails, dine on fresh trout and then
attend a brilliant Shakespearean pro
duction? Not a bad combination at
all.
This summer, "The Tempest,"
Shakespeare's magical talc of
forgiveness and young love,
headlines 12 plays that are attracting
theater aficionados and back
country lumberjacks alike.
The production leaves 110 emo

tion untouched. From the hilarious
scenes involving the monster
Caliban and his drunken com
panions to the romantic moments of
courtship between Prince Ferdinand
and Miranda, the audience remains
thoroughly enchanted. The comedy
is staged with a modern twist, but
the traditional scenes of love and
forgiveness would satisfy even a
purist.
Shakespeare's portrayal of art and
romance in the wilderness is right at
home in the wilds of southern
Oregon.
At $9 to $1 5, tickets for any of the
festival's three theaters, including an
outdoor Elizabethan stage, are a
bargain. Other plays offered this
summer include: Shakespeare's "As
You Like It," "Measure For Mea
sure" and "Titus Andronicus;" An
ton Chekov's "The Three Sisters;"
Henrik Ibsen's "An Enemy of the
People;" and"The Three Penny
Opera" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt
Weill. The 140-seat Black Swan
theater also offers three lesser
known, very contemporary works.
A trip to Ashland would not be
complete without visiting some of
the town's many unique shops and
restaurants. It may be small-town
Oregon nestled in a valley and sur
rounded by sheep and cows, but
Ashland is home to an Afghan res
taurant, a shop featuring hand-knit
clothing and a myriad of bookstores
and pastry shops as well as Harry and
David's Original Country Store.
Southern Oregon this summer
will also be home to the Britt Fes
tival in Jacksonville, which will offer

bluegrass, classical and jazz music
through Aug. 25. But beware,
reservations should be made well in
advance if you want to stay in one of
Ashland's many hotels, smaller inns
and campgrounds.
But if camping in a national park
is more your style, Crater Lake is a
beautiful two-hour drive to the
northeast, just be sure to call ahead
to check the weather report. This
Fourth of July, the park was covered
with snow by a freak blizzard, the

lake was obscured by fog, and
vehicles were only allowed as far as
the visitor's center and lodge.
The spectacular 4,000-foot deep
lake, sitting in the caldera of an ex
tinct volcano,- -and the surrounding
evergreen forest provide beautiful
sights and hikes when the weather is
good.
A few hours to the south, Lassen
Volcanic National Park offers more
natural wonder to complement a
trip to the festival. The park encom

passes miles of hiking trails,
lakesides and meadows for the less
adventuresome picnicker. For the
bold hiker, the park offers the for
midable 10,457-foot Lassen Peak.
From the summit, accessible by a
steep, two-and-a-half-mile trail, one
can view the entire park and
beyond.
So whether you're a theater buff
with a flair for nature or a naturalist
with a penchant for drama, venture
north — a new world awaits you.
