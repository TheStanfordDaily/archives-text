# Eric Healy is The Night Guy
## A
						roving search for nightlife in So-Cal

Unlike most Californians, I
can take San Diego with a grain
of sand . . . make that a lot of
sand. Sure, the beaches are gor

best served by a place fittingly
called Confetti in La Jolla.
Despite recommendations to
sample two other places, namely
Mannequins, labeled yuppie
even by area yuppies, and Roxy's,
a progressive hang-out that
