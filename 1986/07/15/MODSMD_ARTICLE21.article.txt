# Eric Healy is The Night Guy
## A 						roving search for nightlife in So-Cal 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Unlike most Californians, I
can take San Diego with a grain
of sand . . . make that a lot of
sand. Sure, the beaches are gor
geous, and there are more beauti
ful people per capita than
anywhere else south of the Arctic.
But the merry-go-round stops
when the sun sets.

Amid this so-so-Cal generation
bent on putting lemon in their
hair, bleach on their teeth and
suntan lotion everywhere else, it
is difficult to grasp why so little
exist- in the way of nighttime en
tertainment options, excluding,
of course, curling up with a good
book.
After hearing rumors to this ef
fect, 1 will admit being a tad
hesitant when three old friends
from Boston rang me from San
Diego to say, "Get down here to
party like old times!" Grumbling
to myself, "What a horrible
thought — deja vu with a hang
over," 1 consented.
Having forsaken many vices
since my Boston days, I won

dered if my tastes would be com
patible with these late-blooming
spring breakers.
Fortunately, the old sparks of
friendship were easily stoked into
a blaze not unlike that found in
the rear of an oven.
Two of these friends, being on
military leave, were pursuing
women with the enthusiasm of
piranhas in a feeding frenzy; the
third was at least sympathetic to
their cause — truly an all or bust
situation.
However amoral this sounds, it
is even more disillusioning to
think that San Diego has
produced a night scene tailor
made for such human affairs.
Of the three hot spots that were
brought to our attention, my
comrades saw their "needs" as
best served by a place fittingly
called Confetti in La Jolla.
Despite recommendations to
sample two other places, namely
Mannequins, labeled yuppie
even by area yuppies, and Roxy's,
a progressive hang-out that
piqued my dancing feet, my
partners were still obsessed with
the "potential" Confetti's had ex
hibited earlier and insisted that
Saturday night "it would be hap
pening."
Only a muffled "Ohh no!" was

heard before I was loaded into
the rent-a-car and taken to
what I was sure would be pur
gatory on earth.
While I do not wear a halo
when on the town, the moral
climate in this place was in
tandem with level four of
Dante's "Inferno."
People were louder and
more forward than Joan Rivers
and Don Rickles at a Twisted
Sister concert. But then, they
had to be. Whenever forceful
music is combined with forced
drinking, gestures tend to be
grossly exaggerated.
Naturally, it was no great
shock to cruise the club one
hour after arriving and find all
of my friends already paired
off with some of San Diego's
loveliest.
I, on the other hand, had
only dancing on my mind and
feet, despite the suggestiveness
of the scene. With every beat
of the music, more and more
phone numbers were being
passed between virtual strang
ers as egregious desires effer
vesced .
As much as I dislike being a
nocturnal brat, it is simply an
other case of having been
spoiled by the party offerings
of San Francisco.
