# 'Great Wall' shares insight
## 
### FELICIA WONG Staff writer 
Wearing a Stanford T-shirt, hip Chinese-American
Paul Fang travels through the streets of ancient Beijing
to the beat of a Walkman. In this scene, as in many
other vignettes, director Peter Wang displays a light
comic touch that propels his new film "A Great Wall."
The premise of the film is a simple one: the Fangs, a
Chinese-American family, decide to take a trip to
Beijing, the city that Leo Fang (Peter Wang) left 30
years ago. There they visit Leo's sister, Mrs. Chao
(Shen Guanglan), and her traditionally Eastern family.
At times this premise dictates the film and scenes
become typical East vs. West stereotypes, such as the
pedestrian contrast between Leo, the American jogger,
and Mr. Chao, the Chinese tai-chi athlete. However,
Wang usually manages to create original situations and
lively, engaging characters that together use the East-
West contrast, and finally move beyond it. These char
acters transcend the cultural wall between them and dis
cover that they do share things in common as well as
having differences.
Wang himself gives a likable performance as Leo
Fang, a Silicon Valley computer expert who, despite 30
years of American life, still speaks with a Chinese accent
because "it's kind of cute." And Chinese star Hu
Xiaoguang is a droll Mr. Chang, a retired high govern
ment official who is both suspicious of and curious
about the alleged depravity of the modern West. "You
don't know what it's like in America,"he says to his wife
with certainty. "The streets are filled with
homosexuals."
The real stars of the movie, though, are the youths; it
is when modern America meets modern China that the
sparks fly and the fun begins. Li Qinquin is charming as
Lili, the young Chinese daughter who worries about
boys and fashions as much as she worries about the up
coming college entrance examinations. Although she
respectfully remains within the boundaries of traditional
Chinese propriety, she asserts her independence from
her parents, dating Liu (Wang Xiao) and insisting that
her mother 110 longer read her mail. "1 need privacy,"
she says. "You cannot understand. You cannot translate
privacy into Chinese."
Lili's cousin Paul (Kelvin Han Yee) only serves to fur

ther pique her curiosity about American life. Paul is the
movie's funny man — an assertive teen clad in Pierre
Cardin and Calvin Klein, he brings lively humor to "A
Great Wall." His idea of a Chinese souvenir for his
American girlfriend is a T-shirt that reads, "Put the
Great Wall on your chest." He later complains that
"they have squat toilets here. I can't deal with it."
Han Yee portrays Paul with a balance of bravado and
tenderness. Paul can't speak a word of Chinese — ("You
sent me to Chinese school all these years. I never got to
watch Bugs Bunny.") — yet he displays the Chinese no
tion of ancestral respect at his grandfather's grave in one
of the movie's more emotional scenes.
Overall, the film is episodic as Peter Wang creates
snippet after snippet, guiding "A Great Wall" to trip
along merrily. Wang's Silicon Valley company is won
derfully eccentric, complete with a dancing computer
scientist and an incompetent boss. The film watches the
streets of Beijing intently, capturing old men playing
cards and round-faced toddlers. In another sequence, a
Chinese dance hall plays American folk tunes with big
band instruments while the crowd bops as energetically
as it would to Huey Lewis. Wang gives the audience
slices of life to savor, then moves on.

"I need privacy," she says.
"You cannot translate privacy
into Chinese."

Although most of the screenplay, co-written by Wang
and Shirley Sun, is fine, the film does, however, suffer a
hit from overly-staged dialogue. The lines "Would you
like some hitter melon, Uncle?" to the response of "No,
I've had enough bitterness in my life," are probably in
tended to characterize a special brand of Chinese wis
dom, but are far less effective than simple shots of
Beijing's people.
Also, the film's plot takes several peculiar twists.
What happens to Lili and her preparation for the college
entrance examinations at the film's end? Lili's fate is un
satisfying, and it seems that Wang and Shirley Sun were
indecisive about what the outcome of her story should
be.
However, overall, the film is ex
cellent in its portrayal of Chinese
life and its reflections on the
Chinese-American experience. Al
though "A Great Wall" is a comedy,
it manages, as many good comedies

do, to touch upon some serious is
sues. Paul accuses his father, "You
don't like Linda (Paul's girlfriend)
because she's not Chinese. Well, all
Chinese parents are racist. They use
tradition and culture to cover it up,
but they are.'' Wang does not dwell
on the issue, nor does he resolve it,
but he does hit a raw nerve in
Chinese-American culture. When
does ethnic pride become ethnic
chauvinism, he asks.

sent me to Chinese school all these years. I never got to
watch Bugs Bunny.") — yet he displays the Chinese no
tion of ancestral respect at his grandfather's grave in one
of the movie's more emotional scenes.
Overall, the film is episodic as Peter Wang creates
snippet after snippet, guiding "A Great Wall" to trip
along merrily. Wang's Silicon Valley company is won
derfully eccentric, complete with a dancing computer
scientist and an incompetent boss. The film watches the
streets of Beijing intently, capturing old men playing
cards and round-faced toddlers. In another sequence, a
Chinese dance hall plays American folk tunes with big
band instruments while the crowd bops as energetically
as it would to Huey Lewis. Wang gives the audience
slices of life to savor, then moves on.

"I need privacy," she says.
"You cannot translate privacy
into Chinese."

Although most of the screenplay, co-written by Wang
and Shirley Sun, is fine, the film does, however, suffer a
hit from overly-staged dialogue. The lines "Would you
like some hitter melon, Uncle?" to the response of "No,
I've had enough bitterness in my life," are probably in
tended to characterize a special brand of Chinese wis
dom, but are far less effective than simple shots of
Beijing's people.
Also, the film's plot takes several peculiar twists.

entrance examinations at the film's end? Lili's fate is un
satisfying, and it seems that Wang and Shirley Sun were

However, overall, the film is ex
cellent in its portrayal of Chinese
life and its reflections on the
Chinese-American experience. Al
though "A Great Wall" is a comedy,
it manages, as many good comedies

do, to touch upon some serious is

don't like Linda (Paul's girlfriend)
because she's not Chinese. Well, all
Chinese parents are racist. They use
tradition and culture to cover it up,
but they are.'' Wang does not dwell
on the issue, nor does he resolve it,
but he does hit a raw nerve in
Chinese-American culture. When
does ethnic pride become ethnic
chauvinism, he asks.
Wearing a Stanford T-shirt, hip Chinese-American
Paul Fang travels through the streets of ancient Beijing
to the beat of a Walkman. In this scene, as in many
other vignettes, director Peter Wang displays a light
comic touch that propels his new film "A Great Wall."
The premise of the film is a simple one: the Fangs, a
Chinese-American family, decide to take a trip to
Beijing, the city that Leo Fang (Peter Wang) left 30
years ago. There they visit Leo's sister, Mrs. Chao
(Shen Guanglan), and her traditionally Eastern family.
At times this premise dictates the film and scenes
become typical East vs. West stereotypes, such as the
pedestrian contrast between Leo, the American jogger,
and Mr. Chao, the Chinese tai-chi athlete. However,
Wang usually manages to create original situations and
lively, engaging characters that together use the East-
West contrast, and finally move beyond it. These char
acters transcend the cultural wall between them and dis
cover that they do share things in common as well as
having differences.
Wang himself gives a likable performance as Leo
Fang, a Silicon Valley computer expert who, despite 30
years of American life, still speaks with a Chinese accent
because "it's kind of cute." And Chinese star Hu
Xiaoguang is a droll Mr. Chang, a retired high govern
ment official who is both suspicious of and curious
about the alleged depravity of the modern West. "You
don't know what it's like in America,"he says to his wife
with certainty. "The streets are filled with
homosexuals."
The real stars of the movie, though, are the youths; it
is when modern America meets modern China that the
sparks fly and the fun begins. Li Qinquin is charming as
Lili, the young Chinese daughter who worries about
boys and fashions as much as she worries about the up
coming college entrance examinations. Although she
respectfully remains within the boundaries of traditional
Chinese propriety, she asserts her independence from
her parents, dating Liu (Wang Xiao) and insisting that
her mother 110 longer read her mail. "1 need privacy,"
she says. "You cannot understand. You cannot translate
privacy into Chinese."
Lili's cousin Paul (Kelvin Han Yee) only serves to fur

ther pique her curiosity about American life. Paul is the
movie's funny man — an assertive teen clad in Pierre
Cardin and Calvin Klein, he brings lively humor to "A
Great Wall." His idea of a Chinese souvenir for his
American girlfriend is a T-shirt that reads, "Put the
Great Wall on your chest." He later complains that
"they have squat toilets here. I can't deal with it."
