## Profs, summer-ize their classes with zest 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
They could be on the beaches of
Florida spilling sun screen and sip
ping sangria. Or they could be
researching their pet projects in the
Soviet Union. But some Stanford
professors choose to forego their
summer vacations. Instead they
remain on campus to teach the
reduced number of classes offered
this quarter.
Each professor, it seems, has a
different reason for staying.
In his 36 years of teaching at
Stanford, George Spindler, profes
sor emeritus of anthropology, has
noticed a difference between sum
mer class-goers and the regular stu
dents. "I know the Stanford student
body," Spindler says. "Stanford stu
dents like a subtle humor, an allu
sion we kind of share. (They) expect
you to be a bit humorous."
Spindler says he has developed a
"feel for Stanford undergraduates"
that gives him a special rapport with
his students during the regular
school year that he does not feel
with summer students. Summer stu
dents are more likely to be auditors,
high school students, graduate stu
dents from other fields, working
adults and students visiting from
other colleges. Spindler says he
believes certain subjects are better
received during the regular year
than in the summer.
"I know how to talk to Stanford
students about male-female
relationships and homosexuality,"
he says."I don't feel that way with
other students. Perhaps they're not
as sophisticated. ... Or maybe it's
just not something they talk about."
Looking around the classroom
during a lecture, Spindler does
"kind of a radar search."
"If I were with Stanford students,
I know that we would be in tune
with each other," he says. "When I
see a bored or offended Stanford stu
dent, I have a pretty good idea of
what's wrong."
But "outsiders" in the summer
class do add an enriching diversity,
Spindler says. In his seminar on the
ethnography of schooling, he says
the classroom environment is

"extremely stimulating," largely due
to the many people with back
grounds in education.
Spindler and his wife Louise
commute to Stanford three days
each week to teach. They return to
their home in Calistoga for the
remainder of the week. There
Spindler drafts research proposals
and writes books.
Philosophy Prof. Dagfinn Folles
dal is another commuter. His
commute, however, is transatlantic.
Follesdal usually spends two quar
ters at Stanford each year and two
quarters teaching at the University
of Oslo in Norway.
Follesdal sees "a big difference"
between summer students and those
enrolled during other quarters.
While Stanford students taking his
classes usually have similar aca
demic backgrounds and "a fairly
good grounding" in philosophy, he
says summer students are often from
other disciplines. Follesdal adjusts
his lectures to account for this differ
ence and pays more attention to ma
terial presented early in the course.
Though he enjoys teaching, Fol
lesdal says "it's a little hard to go
back and forth between teaching and
writing." He'd like some uninter
rupted time to work on his latest
book, which is about Edmund
Husserl's phenomenology.
"I'd prefer a situation where I can
sit for weeks or months writing," he
says. "Then I would want an intense
period of teaching. Teaching during
the year is more rewarding. Classes
are larger, and you feel more a part
of the department's general pro
gram."
Peter Smith, a visiting professor
from the University of Virginia who
received his Ph.D. at Stanford, has a
different outlook toward summer
teaching. He prefers teaching his
English class during the summer
over teaching in the Western Cul
ture Program in the spring.
"The difference between a volun
teer crew and a press gang is the big
gest difference in higher education,"
he says. Summer students freely

quired to take Western Culture
during the school year.
In addition to teaching this sum
mer, Smith is writing a paper on
Charles Dickens to be presented at a
conference in August and he's
working on his second book. "I
adore teaching because it folds into
the writing," he says. "As you teach,
you can be hammering away at a
problem. In the middle of class it

could all become clear."
Gail Mahood volunteered to
teach Geology 1 this summer when
"the person who they had planned
backed out." She prefers teaching
this class in the summer primarily
because the class is smaller.
But Mahood likes to teach regard
less of the quarter. "Though I know
I should give my research more time
for tenure reasons, I often end up
giving more time to teaching, be
cause I get an immediate reward
giving a good lecture," Mahood
says.
