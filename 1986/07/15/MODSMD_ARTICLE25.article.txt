## Never surrender, except in the N.L. East 
### 
With baseball's All-Star game today in Houston, it seems to
be the appropriate time for me to give my midseason awards.
So without any further hesitation, let's honor the outstanding,
the not-so-outstanding and the somewhat ridiculous.
The Throw-In-the-Towel Award: By now, the 11 National
League teams that don't play in New York must surely want to
surrender to the Mets. If the 1969 Mets were "Amazin'," then
this year's team is invincible. With a 59-25 record, New York
is 13 games ahead of its nearest competitor in the Eastern Divi
sion. The Mets' pitching is so deep that Dwight Gooden (10-4)
ranks only third in the starting rotation behind Sid Fernandez
(12-2) and Bob Ojeda (10-2). So much for pennant fever in the
N.L. East this vear.

The Baby-Boom Award: American League rookies Jose
Canseco of the A's and Wally Joyner of the Angels are receiv
ing the most publicity since Fred Lynn and Jim Rice broke in
with the Red Sox in 1975. And rightly so. Canseco leads both
leagues with 23 home runs and 78 runs batted in. If not this
year, he should in the near future become the first player since
George Foster to hit 50 home runs in a season. And he could
make it a habit.

Joyner's power numbers are comparable to those of Can
seco. He has 20 home runs and 72 RBIs at the break. But even
if he doesn't match Canseco home run for home run in the
second half of the season, he will continue to demonstrate his
all-around ability. He is about to crack the top 10 in batting
average, currently swinging at a .312 mark. And, unlike Can
seco, he has also been noted for his fielding prowess.
The Check-To-See-If-He-Wet-His-Pants Award: This one
was easy. Boston s Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd has clearly distin
guished himself over the past two seasons as baseball's resident
baby. Last season, Boyd threw a tantrum in the Sox clubhouse
that Jim Rice quickly put an end to. And just last week, upon
hearing that he had not been selected by Dick Howser to the
A.L. All-Star squad, Boyd proceeded to tear up the Boston
clubhouse and was suspended for three games. It's too bad that
he doesn't have the ability to match his ego. Boyd is 11-6 this
season, but his earned run average is a mediocre 3.77, which
would lead me to believe that he has taken advantage of the
Red Sox' ability to score runs in abundance. I'm sure if Boyd
had been chosen by Howser, he would have found something
else to complain about. I can just hear him crying that he
should have been the A.L. starter instead of teammate Roger
Clemens (15-2).
The What-About-Me? Award: While Rickey Henderson,
Don Mattinglv, Dwight Gooden, Darryl Strawberry, et al.
continue to dominate the news coming out of the Big Apple,
the Mets' Len Dykstra and the Yankees' Mike Pagliarulo
quietly are having career seasons. Dykstra leads the N.L. in
batting (.349) and is a dynamite centerfielder. As important as
Gooden, Gary Carter and Strawberry are to the Mcts, Dykstra
plays an invaluable role, getting on base for the big boys.
Pagliarulo, who last year was platooncd by the Yankees, has 21

home runs through the first half of the season this year, placing
him just two behind Canseco. He has kept the Bronx Bombers'
power supply intact while Dave Winfield has been busy squab
bling with George Steinbrenner.
The Twinkletoes Award: The Dodgers' Bill Madlock,
already on the disabled list with a pulled groin muscle,
prolonged his woes during a workout in Dodger Stadium.
While jogging in the outfield, Madlock tripped over a sprinkler
head, spraining his ankle in the process, and was forced to
remain out of the lineup through the All-Star break. While
Madlock may have reached new depths in incoordination, he
couldn't match the injury that Terry Harper sustained a few
years back. Playing for the Atlanta Braves, Harper separated his
shoulder while waving in a runner from third base.
The If-At-First-You-Don't-Succeed . . . Award: Iwo
seasons ago, when Dodger second baseman Steve Sax was
throwing routine groundballs onto the Hollywood Freeway,
everybody with a mouth was taking shots at him. Whether or
not people resented him for modeling his play after Pete Rose,
Sax seemed to be the player that everyone loved to hate.
Though he still won't be mistaken for Ozzie Smith in the field,
Sax has answered his many critics this season by batting .321
over the first three months. And he continues to be one of the
few major leaguers who truly gives 110 percent every time his
name is in the lineup.
The Thanks-For-the-Help-But-No-Thanks Award: This
award may be somewhat unfair since I haven't been to every
stadium in the past few years, but the Giants' scoreboard oper
ator deserves special recognition here for setting new standards
in irrelevance and ineptitude. At last 1 uesday s Giants-Cubs

game at Candlestick, San Francisco
shortstop Jose Uribe came to the
plate, accompanied by the following
scoreboard message: "Uribe is hitting
over .300 with runners in scoring
position." Unfortunately, at the time
no Giant was on base. Later in the

game, the traditional "Charge!"
message was put up on the screen,
signifying an attempt to get the
home crowd to cheer on a Giant
rally. Once again, however, the
scoreboard operator had erred. The
Cubs were at bat. While the Giants
have been vying for the N.L. West

that at least some semblance of

Candlestick.

would lead me to believe that he has taken advantage of the
Red Sox' ability to score runs in abundance. I'm sure if Boyd
had been chosen by Howser, he would have found something
else to complain about. I can just hear him crying that he
should have been the A.L. starter instead of teammate Roger
Clemens (15-2).
The What-About-Me? Award: While Rickey Henderson,
Don Mattinglv, Dwight Gooden, Darryl Strawberry, et al.
continue to dominate the news coming out of the Big Apple,
the Mets' Len Dykstra and the Yankees' Mike Pagliarulo
quietly are having career seasons. Dykstra leads the N.L. in
batting (.349) and is a dynamite centerfielder. As important as
Gooden, Gary Carter and Strawberry are to the Mcts, Dykstra
plays an invaluable role, getting on base for the big boys.
Pagliarulo, who last year was platooncd by the Yankees, has 21

home runs through the first half of the season this year, placing
him just two behind Canseco. He has kept the Bronx Bombers'
power supply intact while Dave Winfield has been busy squab
bling with George Steinbrenner.
The Twinkletoes Award: The Dodgers' Bill Madlock,
already on the disabled list with a pulled groin muscle,
prolonged his woes during a workout in Dodger Stadium.
While jogging in the outfield, Madlock tripped over a sprinkler
head, spraining his ankle in the process, and was forced to
remain out of the lineup through the All-Star break. While
Madlock may have reached new depths in incoordination, he
couldn't match the injury that Terry Harper sustained a few
years back. Playing for the Atlanta Braves, Harper separated his
shoulder while waving in a runner from third base.
The If-At-First-You-Don't-Succeed . . . Award: Iwo
seasons ago, when Dodger second baseman Steve Sax was
throwing routine groundballs onto the Hollywood Freeway,
everybody with a mouth was taking shots at him. Whether or
not people resented him for modeling his play after Pete Rose,
Sax seemed to be the player that everyone loved to hate.
Though he still won't be mistaken for Ozzie Smith in the field,
Sax has answered his many critics this season by batting .321
over the first three months. And he continues to be one of the
few major leaguers who truly gives 110 percent every time his
name is in the lineup.
The Thanks-For-the-Help-But-No-Thanks Award: This
award may be somewhat unfair since I haven't been to every
stadium in the past few years, but the Giants' scoreboard oper
ator deserves special recognition here for setting new standards
in irrelevance and ineptitude. At last 1 uesday s Giants-Cubs

game at Candlestick, San Francisco
shortstop Jose Uribe came to the
plate, accompanied by the following
scoreboard message: "Uribe is hitting
over .300 with runners in scoring
position." Unfortunately, at the time
no Giant was on base. Later in the

game, the traditional "Charge!"
message was put up on the screen,
signifying an attempt to get the
home crowd to cheer on a Giant
rally. Once again, however, the
scoreboard operator had erred. The
Cubs were at bat. While the Giants
have been vying for the N.L. West
title this season, it's good to know
that at least some semblance of
mediocrity remains lurking in
Candlestick.
With baseball's All-Star game today in Houston, it seems to
be the appropriate time for me to give my midseason awards.
So without any further hesitation, let's honor the outstanding,
the not-so-outstanding and the somewhat ridiculous.
The Throw-In-the-Towel Award: By now, the 11 National
League teams that don't play in New York must surely want to
surrender to the Mets. If the 1969 Mets were "Amazin'," then
this year's team is invincible. With a 59-25 record, New York
is 13 games ahead of its nearest competitor in the Eastern Divi
sion. The Mets' pitching is so deep that Dwight Gooden (10-4)
ranks only third in the starting rotation behind Sid Fernandez
(12-2) and Bob Ojeda (10-2). So much for pennant fever in the
N.L. East this vear.

The Baby-Boom Award: American League rookies Jose
Canseco of the A's and Wally Joyner of the Angels are receiv
ing the most publicity since Fred Lynn and Jim Rice broke in
with the Red Sox in 1975. And rightly so. Canseco leads both
leagues with 23 home runs and 78 runs batted in. If not this
year, he should in the near future become the first player since
George Foster to hit 50 home runs in a season. And he could
make it a habit.

Joyner's power numbers are comparable to those of Can
seco. He has 20 home runs and 72 RBIs at the break. But even
if he doesn't match Canseco home run for home run in the
second half of the season, he will continue to demonstrate his
all-around ability. He is about to crack the top 10 in batting
average, currently swinging at a .312 mark. And, unlike Can
seco, he has also been noted for his fielding prowess.
The Check-To-See-If-He-Wet-His-Pants Award: This one
was easy. Boston s Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd has clearly distin
guished himself over the past two seasons as baseball's resident
baby. Last season, Boyd threw a tantrum in the Sox clubhouse
that Jim Rice quickly put an end to. And just last week, upon
hearing that he had not been selected by Dick Howser to the
A.L. All-Star squad, Boyd proceeded to tear up the Boston
clubhouse and was suspended for three games. It's too bad that
he doesn't have the ability to match his ego. Boyd is 11-6 this
season, but his earned run average is a mediocre 3.77, which
would lead me to believe that he has taken advantage of the
Red Sox' ability to score runs in abundance. I'm sure if Boyd
had been chosen by Howser, he would have found something
