### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
The second of two Delta Upsilon
fraternity members charged with
misdemeanor arson and mis
demeanor vandalism pled not guilty
to both charges Friday in Palo Alto
Municipal Court.
Junior Steve Gilland, not present
at his arraignment, entered the pleas
through his attorney.
Both Gilland and senior Tom
Diliberti have been accused of set
ting a couch on fire and throwing it
from a third-story balcony of the DU
house April 12, according to Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Diliberti, who faces the same
charges as Gilland, also pled not
guilty at his arraignment June 25.
Gilland's attorney, Mark
Solomon, declined to comment on

whether or not the case will come to
trial. The earliest a trial could take
place would be November or
December, he said.
Solomon refused to discuss the
case further.
University Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole said the University is
considering disciplinary action
against one of the two students, but
she would not identify which one.
The University will probably
make a decision in the case by "the
end of the summer," Cole said.
The Santa Clara County District
Attorney's Office filed charges
against Gilland and Diliberti early
in June, following an investigation
of the couch incident by Stanford
police.
If convicted, the two students
could each face a maximum $1,000
fine and up to a year in jail.
