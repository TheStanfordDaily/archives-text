### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
The University joined its neigh
bors yesterday in establishing a
council aimed at further investigat
ing the chemical spill in Palo Alto's
Matadero Creek and centralizing
communication regarding the use of
toxic chemicals at the Stanford Re
search Park.
I he Hazardous Materials Coordi
nating Council is comprised of rep

resentatives from the University, the
residents of Barron Park, the City of
Palo Alto and the tenants in the re
search park, according to Palo Alto
Fire Chief Bob Wall.
The University is also co-signing
a letter with the City of Palo Alto
"urging (research park tenants) to
look carefully at storm drains and
other channels that flow into the
creek," said Andy Doty, director of
University Community Relations.
The four groups represented in

the new council met early yesterday
morning and will meet again later
this week to conclude any cleanup
plans related to Matadero Creek,
Wall said.
Homeowners, who recently
devised their own cleanup plan, had
a "positive reaction (to yesterday's
meeting). Things arc definitely de
veloping well," according to Jane
Mickelson, a representative of the
Barron Park Associates, a group
representing the homeowners living
near both the industrial park and the
creek.
The Barron Park Associates will
elaborate on their position at a press
conference this afternoon, she said.
In addition to Wall and Mickel
son, the new four-member council
includes Zena Murphy, associate
director of Lands Management at
Stanford, and Glenn Affleck of
Hewlett-Packard, representing the
tenants.

Yesterday's meeting was another
step taken in response to the recent
mineral oil spill at Varian As
sociates, a tenant of the industrial
park. The spill contaminated the
creek with polychlorinated bip
henyls, a suspected cancer causing
chemical.
The city reported at the meeting it
feels they have the situation under
control, Doty said. Wall said that
the latest set of lab results will he
available today.
Both Wall and Doty said that the
list of programs designed early last
week by the residents to clcan up
and prevent toxic contaminations in
the area are "easily being met."

Maps of toxic holding areas and
recent reports on the status of past
spills will be made available this
week, Wall said. Also, the city is
currently conducting tests along the
full length of the creek and will con
tinue doing so for the full six weeks
requested if necessary, he said.
Wall added that inspectors are
constantly on the industrial site and
there is "not a need to do another in
depth inspection of the industrial
area."
"Stanford has offered to retest six
domestic wells in Barron Park that
were tested earlier this year for toxic
chemicals," Doty added.
