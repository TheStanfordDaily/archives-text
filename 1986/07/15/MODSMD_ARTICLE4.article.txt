University estimates of nearly $20,000 in property
damage to the Delta Upsilon fraternity house are
"unfair" and reflect "deterioration (of the house), rather
than damage," DU house manager Greg Gamble said
yesterday.
This year's DU residents have been unjustly "stuck
for the costs . . . (of) damage that has occurred over
many years' time," DU president Scott Hartman said.
Based on damage assessments made by Row officials,
the Office of Residential Education earlier this month
mailed property repair bills totaling $19,636.13 to resi
dents of the fraternity.
"The house is 90 years old," Hartman said. "People
have lived [there] for a long time . . . the damage has
been cumulative.
Although Row Facilities Director Lucy Williams
agreed that a lot of damage had been done to the DU
house over the years, she denied that this year's DU resi
dents were being charged for damage they did not do.
"We're pretty experienced at this and know what's
new damage and what's old," she said. "They did a lot
of damage this year. "
"We've been fair," Williams added. "We've tried to
keep costs (to the DUs) down."

According to Hartman, the bills show a "number of
discrepancies."
Specifically, this year's DU residents have been billed
for pieces of furniture which were missing even before
house residents arrived last fall, Hartman said.
Gamble said he made a check of furniture in the DU
house a week before the end of spring quarter and found
that "give or take a desk chair or two, we had all the
furniture we were supposed to have . . . according to
Row inventory lists."
"It was all there, and now they're charging us for it,"
Gamble said.
But according to Williams, Row Facilities keeps ac
curate records "and the (DU) house was missing a lot of
furniture."
Although he is dissatisfied with the University's
damage assessment, Hartman said lie and most DU resi
dents plan to pay their bills. "The University holds all
the cards. If we don't pay, they'll hold our registration
cards in the fall," Hartman said.
DU members will have to "pay the bill and contest it
later," he said.
Citing "the awful shape of the house," as well as
"unacceptable behavior" by DU members this spring,
University officials early this month announced their in-
