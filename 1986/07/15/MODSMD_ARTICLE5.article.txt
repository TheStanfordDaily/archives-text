## Post office works to upgrade service 
### NICOLE MICHAELS 
Walk by around noon and
you'll likely find patrons more
nonplussed with long lines than
criss-crossed with tan lines and
more red in the face with chagrin
than with sunburn.
Slow-moving lines spiraling
inside and outside the doors of
the Stanford Post Office have
frustrated customers over the past
academic year. Most summer
campus-dwellers seemed equally
disturbed.
"The longer the lines get, the
slower the clerks seem to work,"
said junior Anne O'Brien.
"I'd rather buy 10 packages of
stamps by pumping nickels into
the vending machine than buy

stamp books from the people (at
the counter)," said one graduate.
The clerks most often are
"indifferent at best and downright
rude at worst," another said.
Most students prefer to use the
automated services over waiting
in line for counter service. But
several students complained that
the stamp machine outside too
often spits back coins instead of
stamps and that the-one inside is
sometimes out of stock.
Some students said that while
other post offices may not be op
timally run, the Stanford office is
particularly slow and inefficient.
Bob Bush, acting manager of
the Stanford post office, says he is
aware of student complaints. But he says he thinks sin
gling out the Stanford office is unjustified. The campus
branch is staffed comparably to other post offices, he
says, and it offers services which are competitive with
other postal branches.
Bush recommends that patrons utilize the vending
services and avoid times between noon and 2 p.m. and
the rush before closing at 5 p.m. He says business is
slowest and lines are fastest during the morning and late
afternoon periods, except for the time just prior to
closing.
At least a few customers arc happy with the campus
post office. Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the
Row, prefers the Stanford office over other local
branches. "I'd rather mail from (Stanford)," he says.
"Mail gets where it's going a lot quicker."
Post offices across the nation are working to upgrade
postal services as part of a national campaign. In
response to student complaints over the past academic
year, the Stanford office may shift its operation hours in
time for the coming fall quarter. Opening cither earlier
or later might help mitigate the problem of long lines,
Bush says.
More immediately, Bush says he places his faith in
improved efficiency with a new computerized scale sys
tem. These Moss scales that electronically weigh letters
and packages will work in tandem with computer termi
nals operated by clerks. The clerks will enter a destina
tion for the item to be posted, and the computer will
generate the cost required for postage.
Bush says he expects the new system to be more effi
cient because it will eliminate the time-consuming
process that clerks currently follow of looking up postal
rates in books. The Moss scales operated effectively on a
temporary basis here during the congested period of the
Super Bowl and Olympic Soccer Games. He said the

system is being adopted on a large-scale basis across the
nation and will be installed here in August.
Bush admits that the transition from the old manual
system to the new computerized one might mean a tem
porary setback in terms of efficiency. But the new
services will "undoubtedly be worth the delay," he says.
The post office clerks expressed mixed reactions about
the computerized addition. Ira Castain, who has been at
the Stanford office since 1955, says he looks forward to
the addition. He was trained on the Moss scale in Palo
Alto and says that he "felt lost" after returning to the old
scales. " T he Moss scale tells you everything you need to
know,"he says.
Kenneth Mar, another clerk who has also been here
more than 30 years, says he feels less positive about the
change. Mar says he thinks the Moss scale will slow
transaction time, even after clerks have adjusted to the
new system, because the clerks "have to enter everything
into the system."
"Every stamp we sell, we have to record," he ex
plains.
Bush says he doesn't think the new system will slow
lines and emphasizes that it would increase accuracy —
both in the interest of the postal service controlling in
ventory as well as in the interest of the customer. Both
Bush and the clerks say there would probably be fewer
overcharges to customers for postal rates with the new
system.
Another complaint from students is the shortage of
post office boxes.
The post office here has 7,000 boxes for a far larger
number of students and staff. A sign on the post office
asks students to please reserve the use of post office boxes
for those students who do not receive mail service in
their residences.
The clerks say they recognize that tension exists be
tween patrons and postal employees behind the counter.
"We know that there are a couple of people behind the
counter that aren't very nice," Cas
ta in says.
But both Castain and Mar say
they feel that the majority of clerks
recognize that "it's not the custom
ers' fault" that lines are so long.
The clerks have their own com
plaints. Castain says the main one
involves customers who do not ob

serve the sign that asks them to wait
until they are called to a window.
Both Castain and Mar say a larger
counter staff would help but claim
that budget limitations stand in the
way of increasing the staff.
The campus branch is unique —
and difficult to run efficiently — be
cause of the large volume and vari
ety of mail it handles and the high
rate of customer "turnover" that
parallels matriculation and gradua
tion, Bush says.

But both Castain and Mar say
they feel that the majority of clerks
recognize that "it's not the custom
ers' fault" that lines are so long.
The clerks have their own com
plaints. Castain says the main one
involves customers who do not ob

serve the sign that asks them to wait
until they are called to a window.
Both Castain and Mar say a larger
counter staff would help but claim
that budget limitations stand in the
way of increasing the staff.
The campus branch is unique —
and difficult to run efficiently — be
cause of the large volume and vari
ety of mail it handles and the high
rate of customer "turnover" that
parallels matriculation and gradua
tion, Bush says.
Walk by around noon and
you'll likely find patrons more
nonplussed with long lines than
criss-crossed with tan lines and
more red in the face with chagrin
than with sunburn.
Slow-moving lines spiraling
inside and outside the doors of
the Stanford Post Office have
frustrated customers over the past
academic year. Most summer
campus-dwellers seemed equally
disturbed.
"The longer the lines get, the
slower the clerks seem to work,"
said junior Anne O'Brien.
"I'd rather buy 10 packages of
stamps by pumping nickels into
the vending machine than buy

stamp books from the people (at
the counter)," said one graduate.
The clerks most often are
"indifferent at best and downright
rude at worst," another said.
Most students prefer to use the
automated services over waiting
in line for counter service. But
several students complained that
the stamp machine outside too
often spits back coins instead of
stamps and that the-one inside is
sometimes out of stock.
Some students said that while
other post offices may not be op
timally run, the Stanford office is
particularly slow and inefficient.
Bob Bush, acting manager of
the Stanford post office, says he is
aware of student complaints. But he says he thinks sin
gling out the Stanford office is unjustified. The campus
branch is staffed comparably to other post offices, he
says, and it offers services which are competitive with
other postal branches.
Bush recommends that patrons utilize the vending
services and avoid times between noon and 2 p.m. and
the rush before closing at 5 p.m. He says business is
slowest and lines are fastest during the morning and late
afternoon periods, except for the time just prior to
closing.
At least a few customers arc happy with the campus
post office. Keith Archuleta, assistant director of the
Row, prefers the Stanford office over other local
branches. "I'd rather mail from (Stanford)," he says.
"Mail gets where it's going a lot quicker."
Post offices across the nation are working to upgrade
postal services as part of a national campaign. In
response to student complaints over the past academic
year, the Stanford office may shift its operation hours in
time for the coming fall quarter. Opening cither earlier
or later might help mitigate the problem of long lines,
Bush says.
More immediately, Bush says he places his faith in
improved efficiency with a new computerized scale sys
tem. These Moss scales that electronically weigh letters
and packages will work in tandem with computer termi
nals operated by clerks. The clerks will enter a destina
tion for the item to be posted, and the computer will
generate the cost required for postage.
Bush says he expects the new system to be more effi
cient because it will eliminate the time-consuming
process that clerks currently follow of looking up postal
rates in books. The Moss scales operated effectively on a
temporary basis here during the congested period of the
Super Bowl and Olympic Soccer Games. He said the

system is being adopted on a large-scale basis across the
nation and will be installed here in August.
Bush admits that the transition from the old manual
system to the new computerized one might mean a tem
porary setback in terms of efficiency. But the new
services will "undoubtedly be worth the delay," he says.
The post office clerks expressed mixed reactions about
the computerized addition. Ira Castain, who has been at
the Stanford office since 1955, says he looks forward to
the addition. He was trained on the Moss scale in Palo
Alto and says that he "felt lost" after returning to the old
scales. " T he Moss scale tells you everything you need to
know,"he says.
Kenneth Mar, another clerk who has also been here
more than 30 years, says he feels less positive about the
change. Mar says he thinks the Moss scale will slow
transaction time, even after clerks have adjusted to the
new system, because the clerks "have to enter everything
into the system."
"Every stamp we sell, we have to record," he ex
plains.
Bush says he doesn't think the new system will slow
lines and emphasizes that it would increase accuracy —
both in the interest of the postal service controlling in
ventory as well as in the interest of the customer. Both
Bush and the clerks say there would probably be fewer
overcharges to customers for postal rates with the new
system.
Another complaint from students is the shortage of
post office boxes.
The post office here has 7,000 boxes for a far larger
number of students and staff. A sign on the post office
asks students to please reserve the use of post office boxes
for those students who do not receive mail service in
their residences.
The clerks say they recognize that tension exists be
tween patrons and postal employees behind the counter.
"We know that there are a couple of people behind the
counter that aren't very nice," Cas
ta in says.

recognize that "it's not the custom
