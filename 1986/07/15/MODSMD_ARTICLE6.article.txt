# Fac Sen could still opt to drop pass/no credit
## 
### MORRIE RATNER Staff writer 
Though it died at a Faculty Senate meeting
last spring, a proposal calling for the elimina
tion of the pass/no credit option for distribu
tion requirement courses will be revived next
year if support is evident, the chair of the sen
ate's Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) said yesterday.
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall said he did not
know if there will be enough interest in cur
tailing the use of the pass/no credit option to
bring the issue before the senate next year.
"The problem has not gone away . . . and
shows no signs of going away, he said.
"Whether it happens this year or in the near
future, some C-t S will bring it up again.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Carolyn
Lougee and her office will plav a considerable

role in determining whether the pass/no credit
issue conies before the senate next year,
McCall said. Although many C-US members
contribute to the formulation of its agenda,
Lougee "is a key element in the picture,''
McCall said.
Lougee said curtailing the use of the
pass/no credit option for distribution require
ments "is an important issue. I'm backing it."
She said the revival of the question depends
on whether the C-US decides to pursue it, but
added that the fate of the pass/no credit option
will probably not be on the agenda for the sen
ate's September meeting.
McCall said the senate originally rejected
the C-US proposal to eliminate the pass/no
credit option for all distribution courses be
cause the solution was too simplistic for the
complexity of the problem.
The senate wanted the C-US to "refine" its

proposal, targeting areas where the use of the
pass/no credit option is most prevalant, ac
cording to Lougee. The pass/no credit option
is used mainly for distribution requirements,
particularly "non-West, natural science and
technical courses," she said.
Lougee cited the 42 percent pass/no credit
election rate in one course that satisfies the
natural sciences requirement as evidence of
the increase over the last two years of the num
ber of students using the option. The pass/no
crcdit option rate in the School of Humanities
and Sciences as a whole is only 2 percent.
That's significant," she said.
Klaborating on the senate's rejection of the
C-US proposal, Lougee said members were
concerned that students might feel inclined to
"play it safe" if deprived of the pass/no credit
option. For example, an undergraduate may
opt to take a natural science course designed

for non-majors instead of a tough, mainstream
chemistry course to satisfy the distribution re
quirement unless the pass/no credit option is
available.
"Students are reluctant to publicly say they
are generally doing it (using the option) so they
don't have to work in the course," Lougee
said. "In private, students will tell you that this
is exactly what's happening."
The increased use of the option for distribu
tion requirement courses undermines the pur
pose of the requirements, which is to give stu
dents a significant engagement in a full range
of subjects, Lougee said. The pass/no credit
option has been available since the "era of
liberalization of curriculum" between 1969
and 1971.
I/Ougee said the increasing use of the option
