### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff With wire reports 
While endeavoring to raise $100
million to build the Reagan Library
at Stanford, the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library Foundation
continues to seek an off-campus site
for a controversial public affairs cen
ter.
The University's Board of Trus
tees recently approved the founda
tion's plans for a library on 10 acres
of Stanford land, but since 1983
Stanford has refused to allow the
foundation to build the public affairs
center on University land.
In the 1983 decision, the admin
istration demanded that the center
be under University governance if it
were built on Stanford land.
A foundation board meeting is
scheduled for tomorrow morning to
discuss the future of the library, ac
cording to an assistant to Martin An
derson, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution and secretary of the li
brary foundation's board of trustees.
Foundation officials are currently
seeking a location for the public af
fairs center "in the San Francisco
Peninsula area near the Reagan
Presidential library," according to
information packets distributed in a
$100 million fund-raising drive.

The quiet fund-raising campaign
began early last month when packets
hearing Reagan's signature and a
color photo of the proposed library
were mailed to prospective donors,
according to Gary Jones, the
foundation's executive director. The
packet says contributors of $10,000
or more will be recognized by
plaques displayed at the library and
the public affairs center.
According to the Times Tribune,
the plaques will identify donors by
the following categories: President's
Circle, $100,000; Founder,
$75,000; Benefactor, $50,000; Pa
tron, $25,000; and Friend, $10,000.
Two-thirds of the money raised
for the foundation will be designated
to build and operate the public af
fairs center, the foundation an
nounced last year.
Longtime Reagan supporter
Holmes Tuttle, an Orange County
car dealer, is honorary chairman of
the foundation's 99-member board
of governors. Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-
Nev.) is the chairman.
Other members of the board of
governors include actor Charleton
Heston, Gov. Deukmejian, Sen.
Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), beer
magnate Joseph Coors and Palo Alto
electronics executives David Pack
ard and Dean Watkins.
