# Creek free of toxins

The latest in a series of lab results
show that Palo Alto's Matadero
Creek, which runs through Stan
ford's research park, is no longer
contaminated with polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), Palo Alto Fire
Chief Bob Wall said yesterday.
However, a "low level (of PCBs)
was detected in the sediment''
around parts of the creek, Wall said.
More tests will be taken to determine
its severity, he added.
This latest result culminates al
most three weeks of constant moni
toring of the creek after an "oily
sheen" was discovered on its surface
June 26. A leaky drain line leading
from Varian Associates' Building 2
to the flood control channel respon
sible for the spill has been cleaned
and capped.
The results "didn't surprise us a
great deal," said Gary Simpson, vice
president of Corporate Communica
tions at Varian. The original tests
were focused on the flood control
channel, where the concentrations
of PCBs were the highest, and hot
on the creek itself, Simpson said. He
doubted that any significant
amounts of PCBs ever reached the
creek.
"It's nice to have some evidence
proving that what you support is the
case," Simpson said.
The contamination of PCBs, a

suspected cancer-causing chemical,
was initially recorded at seven parts
per million. Varian's investigation
determined that the release was lim
ited to June 26 when seven to 20 gal
lons of mineral oil containing nine
to 13 parts per million of PCBs
"dripped into surface water in the
channel over several hours," a
Varian press release stated.
Simpson called the mineral oil
discharge "almost a matter of his-

Tory" but added that Varian is con
tinuing both sampling and cleanup
procedures.
Wall speculated that the
trichloroethylene (TCE) and
trichloroethane (TCA) also found in
the creek is "background material"
resulting from earlier and current
underground contaminations in the
area. Tests are still being taken to
determine the source of these sub
stances.
