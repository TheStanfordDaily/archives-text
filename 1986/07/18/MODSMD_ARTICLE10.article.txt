## Duke's anti-divestment drive makes a U-turn 
### 
LOS ANGELES - In an unexpected move hailed as
having "tremendous significance" for national anti-apartheid
movements, California Gov. George Deukmejian has reversed
his policy and proposed total divestment of state funds from
companies doing business in South Africa.
Deukmejian's four-year divestment proposal, if adopted by
the state legislature and the University of California regents,
would affect almost $9 billion in state investments, eventually
more than doubling the financial impact of a national divest
ment campaign that has reached 19 states and 65 cities.
Leaders of anti-apartheid groups said yesterday that the sud
den support for divestment from Deukmejian, a conservative
Republican who last year vetoed a major divestiture bill, sig
nals a major turn in a political tide toward efforts to put eco
nomic pressure on the South African government.
In a letter to university regents announcing his changed
policy, Deukmejian said that his earlier support for a case-by
case consideration of South African investments was intended
to warn that nation's white-ruled government to end discrimi

nation against blacks and Asians.
"Regrettably," the letter said, "the leaders of that country
have ignored our warning, as well as the cries of virtually the
entire Free World, to end apartheid and guarantee basic
human rights to the South African majority.
"California cannot ignore the deteriorating situation in that
country," the letter said. "We must not turn our backs on black
South Africans at this moment of great crisis."
Deukmejian's letter was made public two days before a
planned appearance today by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
before the regents. Bradley, a Democrat, is opposing Deuk
mejian in the November gubernatorial election and is a strong
supporter of divestment.
A Bradley spokeswoman called the letter politically
motivated. Bradley said that the governor is "no leader on this
issue," and that the letter said nothing about continued state
contracting with companies that do business with South
Africa.
Jim Cason, a researcher with the New York-based American

Committee on Africa, estimated that $6 billion so far has been
divested by local and state governments.
Deukmejian proposed that the state and university immedi
ately sell all stock and bonds "in any business enterprise or
bank that increases its operations or facilities, or makes any
new investments in South Africa.''
Other businesses would be told they would have one year to
break South African connections, or the state and university'
would begin selling their holdings. He said the process should
take no more than three years after the one-year warning per
iod.
Under the case-by-case review process of dealing with South
African investments, the university regents so far have divested
themselves of $12.3 million in bonds issued by the Eaton
Corp. of Cleveland.
The university has a total of $2.4 billion in investments con
nected with South Africa. Teacher and state employee
retirement systems hold an estimated $6.5 billion in such in
vestments.
