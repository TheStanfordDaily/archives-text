# Tax reform panel begins work on compromise plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Negotiators from the
Senate and House began the search yesterday
for a compromise tax plan that would restore
confidence in the federal tax system and favor
the middle class without worsening the gov
ernment deficit.
"Some of our decisions will become a
monument to American taxpayers who have
suffered distortions and inequity under the
present tax code," promised Rep. Dan Ros
tenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the 22-member
conference committee that must resolve
hundreds of differences between the bills
passed by the House and Senate.
He and Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), who
heads the Senate delegation, agreed that either
bill is better than current law. And Treasury
Secretary James Baker 111 predicted the confer
ence will pick the best of both bills and come

up with an income-tax system the nation can
be proud of.
No major decisions are likely to be made
before next week and the conference probably
will take a month or more to finish its work.
Leaders are hoping Congress can have the
finished bill to President Reagan for his
signature by Labor Day.
As the panel set to work on the bill, House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill served a
reminder that there is much political capital to
be made or lost on the legislation.
"Chairman Rostenkowski and Senator
Packwood pledged yesterday to write a tax
reform bill that shifts the burden of taxation
from the middle class to those corporations
that currently avoid taxation," O'Neill told
reporters.
"The odd man out is the treasury secretary,

who believes the conference should protect
the business loopholes," he added. "It would
be useful if Mr. Baker read the president's
speech last week in Alabama. We need a tax
bill that reflects the spirit of Dothan, Ala
bama, not Beverly Hills, California."
O Neill, the nation's top elected Democrat,
accused Reagan of "trying to run away with
the credit" for tax overhaul, an issue he said
was launched by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.)
and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.).
Reagan met with the tax writers at the
White House yesterday and was urged by Ros
tenkowski and Packwood to restrain criticism
of the conferees' work.
Packwood and Rostenkowski appeared to
gether on ABC-TV's "Good Morning,
America"and agreed on another matter: that

the tax issue that has generated the most com
plaints is Individual Retirement Accounts.
While the House bill would preserve fully de
ductible JRAs for all workers, the Senate
would allow them only for workers not eligible
for company pensions.
But restoring fully deductible IRAs for all
would cost about $26 billion over five years,
Packwood noted. "You can't have your cake
and eat it too," he said.
Both bills would sharply raise taxes on cor
porations to finance tax cuts for individuals.
Either would reduce tax rates — the Senate
version would cut more deeply — while elim
inating or reducing several deductions and ex
ceptions. Most people would get tax cuts but
some would pay more, especially under the
Senate plan.
