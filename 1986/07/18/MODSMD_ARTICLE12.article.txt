Congress makes cuts constitutional
WASHINGTON! — Congress, taking unusually swift action, yes
terday reaffirmed $11.7 billion in Gramm-Rudman spending cuts that
took effect last March but were ruled invalid last week by the Supreme
Court.
A resolution making the cuts, the first under the budget-balancing
law, was approved 339-72 by the House at midday and by a pair of
Senate voice votes later in the afternoon.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and
others said future deficit-reduction efforts would be in jeopardy if the
cuts imposed last March under an automatic provision subse
quently held unconstitutional — were not reaffirmed.
Rep. William Gray 111 (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Budget
Committee, told the House yesterday that abandoning the earlier cuts
would add $15 billion to the $20 billion already in red ink for fiscal
1987.
President Reagan was expected to approve the action.
The cuts were equally divided between domestic and military pro
grams.
Tapes indicate 'normal' shuttle flight
WASHINGTON — NASA said yesterday that preliminary analyses
of tape recordings from the space shuttle Challenger, salvaged from
the ocean floor, indicate that the crew had no inkling of impending
danger before the ship blew up.
It was the first time since the Jan. 28 explosion of the shuttle that
NASA had addressed anything associated with the last moments of the
seven-member crew. The space agency had been trying for months to
decode onboard tapes, and finally succeeded, a NASA announcement
said.
NASA said that 'preliminary analysis of the tape shows the crew
was unaware of the events associated with the tragedy, and the internal
communications were being maintained as would be expected during
a normal ascent."
The tape recordings stopped at the moment the shuttle was engulfed
in a fireball.
The tapes were recovered from the Atlantic a month and a
half after the accident and were severely damaged by seawater and
chemical byproducts. An intensive effort to clean the tapes and salvage
any data they might contain began as soon as they were recovered.
Frost bacteria tests to start in August
SANTA CRUZ — The nation's first open-air test of a genetically
altered bacteria will begin in August in a potato field near the
California-Oregon state line, University of California (UC) officials
said yesterday.
Scientists made the announcement at the UC regents meeting,
where critics noted the tests had drawn opposition from boards of su
pervisors in two counties, as well as farmers and residents.
"If the regents were not satisfied with the procedure, the test would
have been postponed," said Dr. Lowell Lewis, director of the agricul
tural experiment station at UC-Berkeley.
Developed by UC-Berkeley scientists Steven Lindow and Nickolas
Panopoulos, the test involves bacteria genetically altered to improve
plants' resistance to frost.
