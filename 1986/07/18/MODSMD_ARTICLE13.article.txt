Manila may get Swiss stash
MANILA — At least $213 million stashed by
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos in bank ac
counts in Switzerland will soon be turned over to the
Philippines by Swiss authorities, Swiss Attorney Gen
eral Sedrefy Ordonez was quoted yesterday as saying.
"The money will be forthcoming in 20 to 30
days," Ordonez told a public gathering in Neuva
Ecija Province, the mass-circulation Philippine
Daily Inquirer reported.
Ordonez said the amount represented deposits
placed in at least five Swiss bank accounts by Marcos,
but later disclaimed by him.
Marcos, in Hawaii, said there was no truth to the
story, CBS News reported last night.

U.S. aids Bolivian drug hit
TRINIDAD, Bolivia — At least 100 U.S. troops
arrived here yesterday and were making preparations
with Bolivian police to fight the illegal drug trade.
The three C-130 Hercules U.S. transport planes
carrying the troops arrived at the airport in this tropi
cal city 360 miles northeast of La Paz from Howard
Air Force base in Panama.
Bolivian officials would not allow an Associated
Press reporter to interview the U.S. servicemen.
The helicopters were believed to be headed for the
Josuani ranch, once the property of prosperous
cocaine traffickers and now the base for the U.S.-
Bolivian attempt to disrupt cocaine production and
trafficking.
