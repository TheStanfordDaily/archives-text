Recent attacks alleging insufficient intellectual stimulation at Stan
ford have resulted in questionable University proposals to raise aca
demic standards. The University should understand, however, that
these proposed restrictions and added pressures on students will not
necessarily lead to higher academic achievement.
In response to charges that students are both underchallenged and
too "laid back," the Faculty Senate's Committee on Undergraduate
Studies has focused on the administration's role in stimulating student
interest in academic pursuits, and especially on Stanford's pass/no
credit grading option. Attempting to introduce stricter academic
standards, some administrators are suggesting the elimination of the
pass/no credit option for all courses.
If this action is approved, the University will deprive students of an
important element of personal growth â€” choice. The University's role
is not to impose stringent rules and regulations on students' academic
pursuits, but to encourage students to set their own goals and expecta
tions, and to provide the resources with which to achieve these goals.
Granted, some students take too many classes pass/no credit and
display a lackadaisical approach to their education. But the academic
guidance they need cannot be achieved through fewer options and
stricter rules.
Instead, the administration should take positive measures, such as
revamping Stanford's advising system. While the Undergraduate
Advising Center can provide students with the guidance they may
need, not enough students are aware of this resource. And although
students could find out about this resource from their assigned ad
visers, receiving a good freshman adviser is a "hit or miss" situation.
Many students complain that their advisers are either inaccessible or
simply unaware of all the resources available at Stanford. The Univer
sity should ensure that advisers are more concerned with their advisees
than with their research projects.
Further academic encouragement must also come from the Univer
sity. By encouraging individual accomplishment, the research grants
and honors programs currently offered are on the right track, but again
many students are simply unaware of these opportunities.
So rather than restrict the responsibilities and choices of Stanford
students, the University should alleviate any apparent lapse in aca
demic achievement by providing more opportunities through which
students can explore their own individual potentials.
