# It's hard talking to the TV
## 
### 
T he other day, a friend of mine was watching a beau
tiful sunset from the seat of my car and uttered, "God, I
wish that I could just push the 'pause' button and hold
the sun in that same position forever." At first, I just
nodded my head and kept driving. After all, it would be
nice to see the sunset for more than just two minutes.
But by the off-ramp, a thought struck me, and stayed
with me all the way home.
Twenty years ago, nobody would have understood
what he had meant. Can you imagine your parents out
for a drive in an old Ford, and your father leaning over
to your mother and saying, "Honey, I wish we could hit
the pause button and have this magical moment last
forever"?

Our parents may have been the product of the auto
mobile age, but we are the product of the video age.
Even while miles away from any television or VCR, we
put splendid displays of nature in the context of a little
black machine, which so dominates our lives. All of us
can relate to it, and thus it has become more and more
the common ground upholding conversations.
When people first meet at a bar, for instance, they
may talk about the video on the screen above them as a
way of initiating conversation. They may see a clip of
Peter Gabriel, and comment about how weird the
video's scenery is, and move on to other more lofty and
interesting topics — such as the new Madonna album.
Or, even when we are with a bunch of friends, at least
one person will keep an eye on the person across from
him and another on the video screen, just to make sure
he or she is not missing anything important. God forbid
if Phil Collins should suddenly grow back his hair, and
they not find out about it before all their friends!
Many are not into the bar scene, and may simply go
out to the movies with friends to see a good picture, but
also enjoy their companions' wit, intelligence and man
nerisms. You'd think that in this situation, people
would be forced to interact more. For instance, they
would have to converse at least a little bit if the driver
did not know how to get to the theater. Yet, on the way
to the movie, there is a grand total of five or 10 minutes

of conversation, even if the driver knows his way.
During the next two hours, they can squeeze in pos
sibly 15 minutes of exchange (i.e., "Pass the popcorn,"
"The leading lady is beautiful" or even "This theater
smells"). This may only occur if you dare upset the
yuppie couple next to you concentrating intensely to
understand the "deepness" of "Back to School."
And when the group returns from the movies, the
most loftiest goal is to be the first to get to the television
set and control it for the evening. These video-induced
hazes are certainly comfortable to fall into, and breaking
the silence during a program may be the cause of im
prisonment!
Incidents such as these, while not necessarily evident
every day, are manifestations of a greater trend toward
technology in our society. These little black boxes called
televisions, once created as toys — as momentary diver
sions from work — are-now much more than toys.
The screen has given us its version of life, and we
have chosen to accept it. In fact, the "reality" presented
in videoland dominates our world, and we don't even
know it. Instead of playing basketball with a friend in the
evening, we watch reruns of "Gilligan's Island,"
"Three's Company" and "Webster."
We think we have control over the little machine.
After all, there is the on/off switch, and we just have to
reach up and touch it. . . . Yet, the end of one show
brings the anticipation of another rerun of "The Brady
Bunch," and the dilemma of whether or not one can
identify the events of the entire episode in the first five
minutes achieves great importance. More than just a
friendly game of hoops may be foresaken for this tube.
Pretty soon it becomes dinner with the family, then
studying and finally thinking.
Although we believe we are pondering the human ex
perience while viewing television, we are merely staring
into a piece of glass with light rays passing through it.
We actually turn our backs on humanity and become
engrossed with electronic parts with no sense of humor,
no warmth, no logical reasoning, no intellectual
curiosity and no life, just illusions.
No, my friend, you can't stop the sun with your pause
button. Life does go on outside the television room.
There are gorgeous sunsets, and for that matter, all ovei
the world every day. Yet, your VCR could never capture
the uniqueness of any of them. It could never hear the
birds awakening, nor feel the cool breeze. It could not
laugh at the joke of your friend at your side, nor even
feel the gentle stirrings of hunger within your stomach.
And don't let it convince you otherwise.

T he other day, a friend of mine was watching a beau
tiful sunset from the seat of my car and uttered, "God, I
wish that I could just push the 'pause' button and hold
the sun in that same position forever." At first, I just
nodded my head and kept driving. After all, it would be
nice to see the sunset for more than just two minutes.
But by the off-ramp, a thought struck me, and stayed
with me all the way home.
Twenty years ago, nobody would have understood
what he had meant. Can you imagine your parents out
for a drive in an old Ford, and your father leaning over
to your mother and saying, "Honey, I wish we could hit
the pause button and have this magical moment last
forever"?

Our parents may have been the product of the auto
mobile age, but we are the product of the video age.
Even while miles away from any television or VCR, we
put splendid displays of nature in the context of a little
black machine, which so dominates our lives. All of us
can relate to it, and thus it has become more and more
the common ground upholding conversations.
When people first meet at a bar, for instance, they
may talk about the video on the screen above them as a
way of initiating conversation. They may see a clip of
Peter Gabriel, and comment about how weird the
video's scenery is, and move on to other more lofty and
interesting topics — such as the new Madonna album.
Or, even when we are with a bunch of friends, at least
one person will keep an eye on the person across from
him and another on the video screen, just to make sure
he or she is not missing anything important. God forbid
if Phil Collins should suddenly grow back his hair, and
they not find out about it before all their friends!
Many are not into the bar scene, and may simply go
out to the movies with friends to see a good picture, but
also enjoy their companions' wit, intelligence and man
nerisms. You'd think that in this situation, people
would be forced to interact more. For instance, they
would have to converse at least a little bit if the driver
did not know how to get to the theater. Yet, on the way
to the movie, there is a grand total of five or 10 minutes

of conversation, even if the driver knows his way.
During the next two hours, they can squeeze in pos
sibly 15 minutes of exchange (i.e., "Pass the popcorn,"
"The leading lady is beautiful" or even "This theater
smells"). This may only occur if you dare upset the
yuppie couple next to you concentrating intensely to
understand the "deepness" of "Back to School."
And when the group returns from the movies, the
most loftiest goal is to be the first to get to the television
set and control it for the evening. These video-induced
hazes are certainly comfortable to fall into, and breaking
the silence during a program may be the cause of im
