USW correction
In the July 1 Stanford Daily arti
cle on United Stanford Workers
(USW), "Stanford administration
relations,'' there was an error. This
error was unintentional, I'm sure,
and was due to the wide-ranging
topics discussed. The USW field
representative who was threatened
was on his way to represent a worker
in a Step 1 Grievance. He was not
just distributing union leaflets. The
ability to engage in activities neces
sary to enforce the union contract
and to make the contractual griev
ance procedure effective is an abso
lute requirement for good
labor/management relations. It is
also necessary for adequate contract

enforcement. The USW hopes the
University administration realizes
this fact and halts that kind of behav
ior on the part of some of its
managers.

A stereotypical goof
I would like to make a comment
in response to Trask Leonard's
recent column. As a graduate stu
dent, I am beginning to tire of your
columnists' need to write, and The
Daily's persistent need to print, dis
paraging remarks about the behavior
and appearance of graduate stu
dents.
I am not going to bother with a
litany of ways in which graduate stu

dents are as normal and diverse a
group as undergraduates. Perhaps
this is because I do not find Stanford
undergraduates to be particularly
diverse, unless, of course, one
chooses to characterize a certain
randomness in the application of
basic rules of grammar and syntax as
diversity.
What I would like to point out to
Irask, and to other undergraduates
whose views of us are similarly dis
torted, is that the nerds with the
rearview mirrors do the bulk of the
grading at this university. Consider
ing the reliability of term papers and
bluebooks as a source of humor in
our oh, so boring lives, perhaps the
joke is on you.
