One pair of kidneys is enough
for most of us, but Dr. Bryan
Myers, associate professor of
medicine at Stanford, needs 20
pairs. And, in exchange for $75,
he'd like to study yours for eight
hours.
Each year more than 100,000
kidney disease patients receive ar
tificial kidney treatment, or
dialysis, in the United States.
They typically undergo an in
travenous cleansing that flushes
their arteries and kidneys, typi

"Even under the best condi

uncomfortable."
But Myers and others at the

able someday to stop the disease's
development. Through research
of healthy volunteers, they seek
