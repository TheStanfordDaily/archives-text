## Doctors test kidneys Volunteers help out with new research 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Editorial staff 
One pair of kidneys is enough
for most of us, but Dr. Bryan
Myers, associate professor of
medicine at Stanford, needs 20
pairs. And, in exchange for $75,
he'd like to study yours for eight
hours.
Each year more than 100,000
kidney disease patients receive ar
tificial kidney treatment, or
dialysis, in the United States.
They typically undergo an in
travenous cleansing that flushes
their arteries and kidneys, typi
cally three times a week for four
hours.
Patients sometimes "feel really
bad" physically after the artificial
treatment, said Dr. Ovadia
Shemesh. But it "keeps them in

relatively good shape."
It keeps them alive.
No one enjoys the procedure.
Many patients with kidney prob
lems want artificial transplants,
but only about 3,000 patients can
receive them each year. There
simply aren't enough donors.
"Even under the best condi
tions, we'll never be able to pro
vide enough transplants," said
Myers. "And dialysis can be very
uncomfortable."
But Myers and others at the
Stanford Clinical Research Cen
ter want to make life more com
fortable for kidney disease
patients. In fact, they hope to be
able someday to stop the disease's
development. Through research
of healthy volunteers, they seek
to learn more about kidneys' sen
sitivities.
Anyone who does not suffer from
high blood pressure or diabetes can
volunteer for the kidney research
testing, which involves sugar infu
sion and blood and urine samples.
Often kidney disease is "silent''
and isn't discovered until the disease
has progressed, Myers said.
But doctors here want to be able
to stop kidney problems before they
begin. By detecting the chronic
disease early on, they hope to
prevent deterioration before the kid
ney fails. Based on animal research
of the disease, they believe they may
someday be able to arrest or reverse
the progress of kidney disease.
Treatment would include drug
prescription and changes in the pa
tient's diet, Myers said. Animal re
search suggests a procedure of this
type may be effective in people.
Similar research is being done at
Harvard University and at the Uni
versity of Minnesota in Min
neapolis, Myers said.
It may take "five or 10 years
before doctors know how effective''
the treatment may be, he said.
Myers said he is optimistic about
future application of the research
being conducted here.
