Brain drain. It is a disease that affects many develop
ing countries, but its cure does not lie in medication. As
S.K. Chopra suggests in "Brain Drain and How to
Reverse It,"the solution lies in keeping dispensers of
medication — the doctors — at home.

BOOKS

Brain drain is a phenomenon in which a developing
country's talented young people leave their native
country to study and work abroad, where they find
greater educational and employment opportunities.
Chopra has brought together a collection of essays on
the subject written by prominent Indian scholars.
Chopra, in his three essays included in the book, is
able to write from experience. Born in India, he came to
the United States and received his master's and Ph.d. in
industrial engineering from Stanford. Since his return
to India, Chopra has sought to mitigate the damaging
effects of this so-called "flight of intellectuals."

As many contributors to the book suggest, brain drain
is not merely a result of young people going abroad to
study. Rather, the phenomenon is severely exacerbated
when students return home and cannot find jobs — it is
then that they leave their country permanently.
In India, there is much resentment toward those who
return with foreign educations. As Chopra writes, it is
common to hear the complaint that students who travel
overseas are "pampered" and given special placement in
the workforce. This conception greatly intensifies the
problem, because instead of being pampered, the stu
dents are discriminated against. Indian bureaucracy is so
entrenched that lateral entry in the workforce is ex
tremely difficult. Overqualification and underpayment
prevail. .
After receiving his doctorate, Chopra himself was
able to get a job with the Government of India only after
working at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. and
establishing a reputation in this country.
It is necessary for India to recognize talented students
early in their careers, rather than after they have estab
lished themselves abroad, Chopra writes. By that time,
"we have already lost them."
The solution, then, is not to prevent young students
from leaving, but to provide enough opportunity in In
dia so that they can come back. Entry for students who
study abroad should be made easier by
setting standards of promotion so that
"the meritorious and deserving get
precedence over those with influence
and connections," Chopra writes.
The quality of education and re
search should be upgraded, and
should focus on the needs of the
country. "We have to make our re
search programmes (in India) more
related to our own needs."
Another "cure" proposed by
Chopra is that students be required
to work at home for a specified time
after the completion of a higher pro
fessional education abroad.
This work is significant in its
recommendations because it is writ
ten by Indians. For those interested
in international relations, Chopra
offers unique insight into a problem
that plagues not only India, but
much of the Third World.
It seems that the primary respon
sibility for stopping up the intellec
tual drain rests on the Government
of India, which at one time did not
show much of a willingness to
grapple with the problem. But times
have changed, as is shown in part by
the fact that India's Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi wrote the forward to
Chopra's work.
"Indian scientists, technologists,
doctors and professionals who go
abroad need not be thought of as a
debit but as an investment," Gandhi
writes.
