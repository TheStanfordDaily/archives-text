Brain drain. It is a disease that affects many develop

Brain drain is a phenomenon in which a developing
country's talented young people leave their native
country to study and work abroad, where they find
greater educational and employment opportunities.
Chopra has brought together a collection of essays on
the subject written by prominent Indian scholars.
Chopra, in his three essays included in the book, is
able to write from experience. Born in India, he came to
the United States and received his master's and Ph.d. in
industrial engineering from Stanford. Since his return
to India, Chopra has sought to mitigate the damaging
effects of this so-called "flight of intellectuals."

prevail. .
After receiving his doctorate, Chopra himself was

It is necessary for India to recognize talented students
early in their careers, rather than after they have estab

"we have already lost them."
The solution, then, is not to prevent young students
from leaving, but to provide enough opportunity in In
