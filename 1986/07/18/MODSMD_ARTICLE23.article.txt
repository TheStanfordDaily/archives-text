# Old world becomes classroom for profs.

While getting into the overseas
program of their choice is becom
ing ever easier for students, one
might think that the competition
between professors for the few
positions with Stanford Overseas
Studies would be ferocious. The
truth, however, is that Overseas
Studies solicits professors.
The office sends a general let
ter to all University faculty re
questing their application to go
abroad, according to Dan Moran,
Overseas Studies' academic pro
gram officer.
Each professor is asked to sub
mit a resume, a list of his or her
interests, a description of what he
or she would teach, and course
evaluations to show evidence of
previous good teaching, Moran
said. Also important are his or
her professional connections
overseas and any extracurricular
interests such as opera or
winetasting that would provide
students with special opportuni
ties.
Moran said the application is
reviewed by a faculty panel from

each school here. In the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the
dean budgets for a set number of
quarters of absentee professors.
This means the school will pay
the traveler's salary and pay for
someone to take that professor's
place here at Stanford. Unlike
Humanities and Sciences, the
other schools have no set pro
gram but budget overseas assign
ments on a case-by-case basis.
There is, in fact, no shortage of
overseas professors. A center will
often have more than one profes
sor present. Essentially, as many
professors as are qualified can go
abroad, if they give interesting
course proposals and are paid for
by their school.
Overseas Studies gets many
more applications to teach abroad
from Humanities and Sciences
faculty than from other schools,
not only because it is easier for
these professors to get permission
from their school to go but be
cause the subject matter of the
courses that a Humanities and
Sciences professor would teach is
usually more relevant to the over
