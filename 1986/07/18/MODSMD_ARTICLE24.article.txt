## Intensity and design deliver summer plays 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
I dislike theatrical jargon as much
as the next guy, but in contemplat
ing "Asinamali" at the Berkeley
Repertory Theatre and "Deer Rose"
at Theater on the Square, I keep re
turning to the sense of the "non
mainstream" I felt during both
pieces. Neither production shakes
the world with historical innovation,
but both are certainly a change of
pace from the traditional, well
publicized theatrical fare found in
"The Foreigner" and "Cats."
"Asinamali," which is Zulu for
"We have no money," is performed
by The Committed Artists, a com
pany on tour from South Africa.
The piece focuses on five prisoners
in a South African jail who com
municate to each other their past ex
periences by way of song, dance,
mime and play-acting. The
prisoners' stories chronicle not only
the racial inequality of the apartheid
system, but more importantly dis
play the kind of anger that causes the
violence we take for granted on the
television news each night.
Stonings, beatings and murders
lose their impact after six months on
NBC, but when a man verbally
abuses someone directly, as one
actor does to a member of the audi
ence in this show, the terrifying ten
sion that apartheid brings to daily life
in South Africa is brought home to
the United States. To say the least, it

is a high-energy show from start to
finish, bristling with joyous har
monic chants and enraged, dissonant
screams of terror. Sometimes the
prisoners are all too likable; at other
times, they are less so. The effect of
poverty and apartheid on their per
sonal lives explains their violent acts
but in no way condones them.
The play points out the ignorance
of both blacks and whites in South
Africa and has stirred great contro
versy in townships and cities alike.
At one theater, a mob of angry
blacks entered and searched for the
author (Mbongeni Ngema, who also
wrote the acclaimed "Woza Al
bert"). He was not present, but the
mob vented its outrage nonethe
less; the show's promoter was found
dead the following morning.
Truly, this is not a show for the
faint at heart. The story relies com
pletely on the intensity of the actors,
as the stage is bare and props are
minimal. Their vivacity and stage
force is astounding (the first row of
playgoers is politely asked to change
seats due to the profuse sweating of
the performers). This intensity could
perhaps be lessened occasionally, it
seems, for 90 minutes of it without
intermission wears one down quite a
bit.
Nevertheless, the audience gave a
wholehearted standing ovation for
this topical, energetic and emotional
show. At its peak, one actor tells the
audience that all the violence is "not
about language, passbooks, rent in

creases or gold. What is it about?
You, out there! WHAT IS IT
ABOUT?!" Silence is his only
response.
If The Rep's "Asinamali" relies
solely on the talents of the actor,
then Theater on the Square's "Deer
Rose" across the Bay hedges toward
that of the designer. Tony Pel
legrino, the writer, designer and ar
tistic director of this multi-media
production, creates amazing effects

with his masks, overscaJed costumes
and slanted sets.
The story is autobiographical,
focusing on a young artist's relation
ship with his mother as she nears her
cancer-caused death. Pellegrino
chronicles their life together in a se
ries of flashbacks as well as contem
porary scenes.
The strength of the show,
however, is far-and-away the im
aginative masks Pellegrino's actors

wear. They seem all too real at mo
ments, and when combined with
the excellent gestural and mime
work of the actors, the images are
absorbing. Vocal narration is pro
vided live on the side of the stage
and on tape, which is an interesting
way of separating movement and
sound. Visually, the show is a
knockout.

Africa.
