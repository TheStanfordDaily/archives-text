The Revolting Cocks
"Big Sexy Land"
With a name like the Revolting
Cocks, John Hardcorc probably
walked out of his local import sec
tion thinking he'd found a new
belligerent disk to supplement his
collection. Sorry johnny. In
reality, this excellent new album,
produced by one of the foremost
domestic, avant-garde labels —
Wax Trax of Chicago — is a gem
in its own right.
The Cocks are threefold, one
being Luc Van Acker, the second
being the guitarist from Front 242,
and finally A 1 Jourgensen of Mini
stry fame. All three are Wax Trax
veterans.
On "Big Sexy Land," sounds are
industrial synth — songs with lots
of clanking, scraping and far-off
foghorns — all the essentials for
everyday listening. An added
boner, or rather, bonus is the crea
tive drum tracks that make things

quite danceable. A good example
is "Attack Ships On Fire" (cut 3,
side 1), a current hit in London
dance clubs and bound for Soho
and beyond (excluding One
Step. . .).
This kind of quality makes one
wonder why Ministry left the label?
Oh well, at least The Cocks are
cool.
Steve Win wood
"Back in the High Life"
It has been some time since
Winwood's last solo album,
"Taking Back the Night," and it
seems it was time well spent. "Back
in the High Life" is a fine album
that is sure to break into the radio
airwaves of many top-40 stations.
Winwood's soulful, reedy voice
has never sounded better thanks to
producer Russ Titelan. And as
tunes, the sounds are tremendous.
Particularly impressive and
moving is the title track.

Winwood's soulfulness and
chemistry with the band (which in
cludes Joe Walsli and Nile
Rodgers) almost seems out of char
acter when you go back and listen
to his earlier solo studio work. He
has always seemed the loner and
his R & B flavor often was awkward
in the hollowness of one-man
studio recordings. With this al
bum, his power has been coaxed
out of him.
While this is an album Win
wood can be proud of, we can only
laud it with some reservations.
Missing are those famous Win
wood Prophet V keyboard
passages c ind the musicianship that
makes him a highly demanded
studio musician. The album picks
up more from Earth, Wind and
Fire than from his own consider
able influence. It is a soulful al
bum with some good tunes, but
with the exception of the title
track, it does not seem to be made
on Winwood's terms.

Big Country
"The Sear"
I he thing about Big Country is
that we really want to like them.
And that was very easy after their
debut release, "The Crossing.
These guys were playing serious
rock n' roll that could get you up
and dancing — music that had
something to say that wasn't trite or
cliched, that was damn original
even if you got rid ot the machine
that made the guitars sound like
bagpipes.
When the extended-play version
of "Wonderland" came out, it
seemed the band was rising with
well-deserved meteoric fame and
attention, but the next album,
"Steeltown," brought that to a
stall. The songs were no longer as
moving, though the lyrics were
perhaps more poetic. Guitar licks
seemed lifted from the previous al
bum, and all oi sudden, they

sounded too serious to handle.
"Look Away," the first release
off the latest album, is a very good
song that moves the band in new
directions, but the rest of the al
bum fails to capture its
"danceability" and emotion. On
the whole, the new album rises
above "Steeltown," but still
remains a rung below their earlier
music. Mark Brzezicke's drum still
gives the band tremendous power,
and songs like "The Teacher" and
"The Red Fox" capitalize on his
driving wizardry, accompanied by
the familiar and successful twin
guitar leads, which together come
close to capturing the exuberance
of their earlier songs. Now all they
have to do is either move back to
that earlier song-writing simplicity,
or show signs that they can handle
the complex structure they've since
attempted.
