# 'Romeo and Juliet' never leaves ground
## 
### DAWN DAVIS SCOTT SHAEFFER 
First of all, don't be scared away by the sub
ject matter. We know, we know. . . . Ballet: vi
sions of high-brow snobbery, inflated and
overblown discussion, yawn, yawn, cough,
cough. Bear with us; we speak your language.
And not only are we not your ordinary
reviewers, we are not reviewing your ordinary
ballet company. We're talking the Joffrey, one
of the most innovative, spirited and modern of
the major ballet companies.
Unfortunately there is one slight (OK, not
so slight) problem. Our potentially extraordi
nary review is of the Joffrey's rather ordinary
production of "Romeo and Juliet," a fine ex
ample of the rather typical fare in modern
America's cultural slump that emphasizes
style over substance, pomp over circumstance.
The Joffrey, probably best known in most
circles as the ballet company of which the son
of our fine president (what was that about
pomp over circumstance?) was once a mem
ber, seems to have taken on "Romeo and
Juliet" to prove that their company — in addi
tion to its outstanding reputation for innova
tive and modern pieces — is technically as
serious as any international company perform
ing the classics. We don't think they should
have bothered.
It is really not the Joffrey dancers we want to
criticize, as much as it is this particular bal
let itself, especially after all the hype and
hoopla that accompanied it. It seems as if the
Joffrey realized that they were on shaky
ground in taking on a ballet that demands so
little of their dancers as dancers, and so much
of them as actors. Apparendy, they therefore
attempted to gloss the piece over with such a
high finish that it is often hard to differentiate
the skill of the dancer from the beauty of her
flowing gowns.
Choreographed by John Cranko to the in
credibly dramatic and danceable scjre of Ser
gei Prokofiev, the production features 256 spe
cially dyed costumes hand emboidered with
more than 14,000 pearls and requiring
thousands of different fabrics. There are four
chandeliers, two dozen illuminated jack-o'-
lanterns, cart-loads of fruits and vegetables,
more than a dozen swords, eight truly mag
nificent backdrops hand-painted in Austria,
several dozen masks, 300 silk flowers, more
than $20,000 worth of color-coordinated
boots, and a bridge that spans the entire stage.

The total cost was over $900,000 — the most
expensive production (by far) the company has
ever put on.
Granted, the show has a dazzling visual im
pact, particularly in the ballroom scene when
Romeo and Juliet first encounter each other.
We see Verona's courtiers parade around the
stage in some of the most beautiful bronze,
copper and gold-tinted gowns we have ever
seen (not that we have seen a whole lot of
Veronese gowns).
In fact, Cranko's 1962 version of Prokofiev's
famous score is also quite visual. His choreog
raphy tends to make its dramatic points
through spatial compositions that emphasize
the characters' positions in relation to the en
semble. This version centers less on Romeo
and Juliet themselves than on seeing them as
part of the fabric of Verona.
But despite its strong visual impact, emo
tionally and intellectually this ballet is vapid.
Ultimately we found ourselves asking that
now-trite but all-important question of
modern times: "Where's the beef?" The ques
tion becomes nagging around the third act
when what little dancing there had been stops
and we are forced to sit through some of the
worst acting this side of "Dynasty II." That's
right, you heard us; there is almost no dancing
in this ballet, and even less of it in the last act.
This, of course, places a most unusual and
difficult strain on the dancers, who don't ex
actly rise to the occasion; they just sort of
hover in mid-air for awhile before crash
landing into the scene where Romeo kills
Tybalt. Given the melodramatic nature of the
plot, it could easily tempt dancers to be
hammy or over-expressive, perhaps afraid that
they will not be able to carry off the height
ened drama realistically. Dawn Caccamo,
as Juliet, gives in to this temptation. At first,
her doe-eyed look of naive yet almost orgasmic
excitement is endearing, but it wears thin after
we realize that's about all she can play. And
when all of that trouble with Romeo begins,
the best she can muster is to act confused; we
need the program synopsis to tell us that —
yes, indeed — she is "grief-stricken."
Fortunately, most of the Joffrey dancers
resist the temptation to overdramatize. Special
notice should be given to David Palmer as
Mercutio, whose spirited style and charac
terization easily make him the show's strongest
performer. Other actors, however, including
Romeo and Tybalt, resist the temptation to
overplay so much that they are pallid in

characterization and fail to fill the theater with
their presence. Glenn Edgerton's Romeo is so
lifeless and uninspired that during the climax
of the second act — when Romeo's best friend
Mercutio is killed in a duel with Tybalt — we
once again must refer to the program synopsis
to realize that Romeo is, in fact, "distraught."
Though both Edgerton and Caccamo seem to
dance adequately (again, it is often hard to tell
under the layers of designer costumes), need
less to say the passion required to make any
telling of this story work is beyond them.
The question these criticisms are leading to
is, why do "Romeo and Juliet" as a ballet? Or
at least, why do this version of the story? We're
not saying that Shakespeare's version is
definitive and that it is a crime to remove the
words and to dance it. The story itself was
around for quite some time (and presumably
in many different forms) before Shakespeare
told it his way.
On the contrary, our point is that you are
able to express things with your body that you

are unable to express with words, and vice
versa, and since the medium of dance involves
primarily the body, making the story of
Romeo and Juliet into a ballet should add a
different dimension to it. We should be able to
feel the passion, the torment, the grief of these
lovers through what they are doing and saying
with their bodies. What we saw Saturday night
was a mime troop's bad version of the story
with a few dances thrown in.
We really don't mean to come down so hard
on the Joffrey, and want to encourage you to
go see them perform some of their more
modern pieces the next time they are in the
City, or the next time you are in one of their
two cities, New York and Los Angeles. The
harshness of the review comes because the Jof
frey is one of the highest-quality and well
honed dance companies in America, and it is
disappointing to see them so off the mark on
this one — all because of the pressure to have
a big box office draw, which "Romeo and
Juliet" is, of course.


Romeo (Glenn Edgerton) and Juliet (Dawn Caccamo) share a passionate, still moment to
gether. Throughout, the Joffrey production of "Romeo and Juliet" stressed acting scenes in
Lieu of spirited and uplifting ballet.
