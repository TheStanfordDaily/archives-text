# Hoover honors Sen. Hatfield
## 
### MORRIE RATNER Staff writer 
An assemblage of University and political notables
gathered at the Hoover Institution yesterday to dedicate
the Mark Hatfield Court in honor of the Oregon
senator.
The second-ranking Republican in the Senate and a
Stanford alumnus, Hatfield took the lead in introduc
ing legislation enacted in 1975 to create the nation's
memorial to former President Herbert Hoover at the In
stitution, W. Glenn Campbell, director of the institu
tion, said during the dedication ceremony.
Allan Hoover, son of President Hoover, and Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy joined Campbell in offi
cially dedicating the court.
U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese attended the
dedication after delivering a report on the U.S. judicial
system to the Hoover Institution Board of Overseers.

The board met for its annual West Coast meeting in an
auditorium adjacent to the central courtyard of the Insti
tution, now the Mark Hatfield Court.
Members of President Hoover's family and approxi
mately 110 Hoover Institution staff and members of the
board, including former actress and U.S. diplomat
Shirley Temple Black, also attended the ceremony and
luncheon immediately following the board's meeting.
Campbell and Kennedy gave short presentations
before introducing Hatfield, who was delayed about 45
minutes because his plane arrived late. Campbell
jokingly said he would not refer to deregulation of the
airline industry because too many Hoover Institution
staff members favor it.
Hatfield, who chairs the Senate Committee on Ap
propriations, said he was delighted to be back "in the
womb of the Reagan Administration'' to pay tribute to
his political hero, Herbert Hoover. The
Senator said he has had a long "love affair"
with Hoover's life and the things for which he
stood.
Hoover was a man with humble roots who
rose to be president of the United States and a
world figure, he said. "In the depth of the De
pression, when people were looking for role
models, he was a spiritual inspiration for me,"
Hatfield said.
It is impossible to monitor one's reputation
because history is constantly being rewritten,
Hatfield said. Hoover was vilified in his
lifetime at the height of his career, but saw the
rehabilitation of his image years later.
"I don't like the word 'rehabilitation.' It
assumes there was a lack of data to see the
quality of Hoover's leadership," Hatfield said.
"The evidence has always been there, but like
so many times in politics, we fall for the im
agery instead of the substance."
Hatfield said the opening of the Senate
chambers to television, which he opposed,
will aggravate this problem. He said the televi
sion industry, which surrounds politics,
generates millions of dollars each year and has
made his fellow senators more image
conscious while before the cameras on the
Senate floor.

"If Hoover had run himself ragged trying to
control his image, he still would not have
been able to determine the outcome, he said.
Hoover, however, never based his decisions
on the "whims of popular opinion."
Hatfield said he has tried to emulate
Hoover's commitment to individual responsi
bility, his concern for human suffering and
dignity, and his tendency to give a "people di
mension to all great issues."
Hoover correctly recognized that the first
line of national defense is to provide food and
housing to the population, to fund scientific
research and maintain a productive economy,
Hatfield said. "Hoover never fell for the
simplistic notion that security is found just in a
large arsenal."
Hatfield concluded his remarks by saying
that he noticed the plaque unveiled at the cer
emony naming the court in his honor was put
on the wall with screws, "so it can be taken off.
I realize the transitory nature of life."
Campbell went on to discuss Hatfield's
virtues, saying he has a desirable character
trait that is increasingly rare. "Namely, you
can disagree with him and still remain the best
of friends."
"1 make this point because the Senator and 1
do disagree on one important matter, the size
of military expenditures," he said.
Hatfield has served in the Senate since 1967
and is chair of the Energy and Water Re
sources Appropriations Subcommittee.

bility, his concern for human suffering and
dignity, and his tendency to give a "people di
mension to all great issues."
Hoover correctly recognized that the first
line of national defense is to provide food and
housing to the population, to fund scientific
research and maintain a productive economy,
Hatfield said. "Hoover never fell for the
simplistic notion that security is found just in a
large arsenal."
Hatfield concluded his remarks by saying
that he noticed the plaque unveiled at the cer
emony naming the court in his honor was put
on the wall with screws, "so it can be taken off.
I realize the transitory nature of life."
Campbell went on to discuss Hatfield's
virtues, saying he has a desirable character
trait that is increasingly rare. "Namely, you
can disagree with him and still remain the best
of friends."
"1 make this point because the Senator and 1
do disagree on one important matter, the size
of military expenditures," he said.
Hatfield has served in the Senate since 1967
and is chair of the Energy and Water Re
sources Appropriations Subcommittee.
