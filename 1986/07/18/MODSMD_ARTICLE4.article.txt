# ASSU sets schedule for revised fee rules
## 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
In its shortest meeting on record,
the ASSU Senate Tuesday night ap
proved a schedule for setting and al
locating the General Fees, which
will be set by student body vote start
ing in 1987.
The General Fees is a recent
modification of the Association Fee,
which receives its funds from the
ASSU student fees and helps
finance small student groups. The
new name reflects the fact that stu
dents will now be able to increase or
decrease the General Fees by voting.
In the past, the Association Fee
amount has been set by the senate.
The Association Fee is currently
divided between the Program Board
and the Publications Board. These
boards use the fees to fund student
groups and student publications that
do not receive fee assessments in the
ASSU general elections.

Last spring the student body
passed a eonstitutional amendment,
authored by Graduate Senator Jim
DeLaHunt, which provided that
these two parts of the Association
Fee be called General Fees and that
the student body have the right to
raise or lower the fees' amounts
starting next year.
In the 1987 spring election, to be
held April 14 and 15, the $143,800
currently allocated to the Program
Board and the $40,200 currently al
located to the Publications Board
will appear on the ballot as General
Fees, and students may vote to raise
or lower these amounts.
According to the timetable ap
proved Tuesday, the senate must
select options for changes in the
General Fees by Feb. 10. For exam
ple, the senate could give voters the
choice of raising or lowering the
Program Board's fee by 10 percent or
by 20 percent.
Similar choices will be presented
for the Publications Board's fee. The
choices that receive the most votes
will be enacted. The following year
students may vote to raise or lower
the new amounts. t
The deadline for student groups
to appeal funding decisions made by
the Program Board and the Publica
tions Board will be Feb. 24. After
considering these appeals, the
boards will make recommendations
to the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee.
This committee is in charge of ac
tually allocating the General Fees to
student groups. The committee will
announce its preliminary recom
mendations April 20, and by April
23 student groups will be required to
submit any requests for appeals.
