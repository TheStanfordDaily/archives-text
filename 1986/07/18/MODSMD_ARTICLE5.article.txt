# University settles Paul tenure suit
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Stanford awarded $54,000 to
former Asst. Prof. Diana Paul
this .week, settling a two-vear-old
lawsuit alleging that the University
denied Paul tenure in 1983 beeause
of her sex and raee.
University President Donald Ken
nedy described Paul's case as
"without merit" but said Stanford
decided to settle because of concern
for the health of a faculty member
involved in the litigation
"We deeply regret that the health
of our colleague, Prof. Van Harvey,
prevented our continuing the
defense of the suit," Kennedy said.
Harvey, outgoing chairman of the
Religious Studies Department, was
the hearing officer at the first stage of
Paul's University grievance. He suf
fers from a heart condition and was
advised by his doctor that continued
participation in the case would fur
ther jeopardize his health.
"Unfortunately, this is one of
those very rare cases when consider
ations unrelated to the merits of the
claim govern our disposition of it,"
said John Schwartz, University vice
president and general counsel.
"Serious concern over Prof. Har
vey's health simply outweighed the
value of trying the case."
Paul said yesterday she was
pleased with the sum, which she
called the largest ever awarded in a
tenure case at Stanford. She added,
however, that she had been confi
dent of her chances of winning if her
suit against the Board of Trustees
had gone to court on Sept. 22 as
scheduled.
"Given the fact that some infor
mation embarrassing to the depart
ment chairman (Harvey) would
have come out and his health is so
frail," Paul said, "my attorneys and I
decided we'd be generous and set
tle."
Paul will not be reinstated as a
result of the settlement, though
gaining tenure was an objective of
the suit and would have been ad

dressed in court, she said.
Paul, who is part Japanese and
part Italian, alleged sexual and racial
discrimination after a committee of
I five tenured men in the Department
of Religious Studies voted unani
mously to deny her tenure in
February 1983. She had been a fac
ulty member since 1975.
She also argued that Stanford, in
seeking the advice of outside experts,
incorrectly defined her work as
"Chinese thought and religion."
Her specialty is Chinese Buddhism.
The tenure committee, using
evaluations of Paul submitted by
students and experts in her field, did

not rank Paul "outstanding" in
either teaching or research, the two
categories in which a candidate is
judged. An "outstanding" in either
of the categories is required for ten
ure.
Paul further objected when the
University denied her access to a file
of letters from the scholars who
evaluated her.
Grievances were unanimously
denied successively by the dean of
Humanities and Sciences, the Uni
versity provost, the Faculty Advisory
Board and Kennedy during 1983
and 1984.
Paul also complained to the

Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission but chose to file suit in
October 1984 before the EEOC
could determine the merits of her
case.
Looking back on the suit, Paul
said she is satisfied that her case left

an impact on the law and other ten
ure disputes. Her suit is now part of
the permanent legal record of em
ployment discrimination, and was
widely publicized in a recent
newsletter on tenure law that she has
begun publishing, she said.
Part of the settlement will be
donated to the National Women's
Studies Association, which partially
funded her defense, she said.
