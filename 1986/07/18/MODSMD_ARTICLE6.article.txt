Paris in springtime. A tour of Tours. Fiori from
Firenze. The real Viennese Ball. Sound appealing?
Can't wait to order? Wait, folks, that's not all! Stan
ford's Overseas Studies can now offer you the world,
or at least more of it than before.
It is all part of Overseas Studies' new direction.
Since last September, when a new administration
took over, the goals of Overseas Studies as well as its
plans for the programs themselves have changed.
The new director, Law Prof. Thomas Heller, has
made his top priority the development of programs
in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Japan, ac
cording to Nancy Padgett, the program's deputy
director.
"I think the old program was terrific,'' Padgett said,
"but I think the new programs have grown up to meet
present students' needs.
"We have a pilot program in Krakow, Poland, this
summer. The program in Latin America will have a
public service component like health care delivery
and will include an internship or a group visit to a vil
lage with a professor. There are already plans to set
up the Japanese program in Kyoto. It will include
both traditional study and a section on technology
and innovation.

"We are trying to become less Euro-centered," she
said.
Dan Moran, one of the academic program officers,
said he believes that this development of new over
seas centers will create opportunities for more stu
dents and more professors to go abroad.
"The locations of the new centers were chosen
based on constituencies in Stanford students and fac
ulty," Moran said. "Before, there was nowhere for
Asian Studies majors to go — or experts in Latin
American fields."
Moran said another part of the program's new phil
osophy involves enlarging overseas programs to allow
more students to participate. "At present the Paris
program is. limited to 20 people," he said. "Who
decided that? There is no reason to limit the number
of students.
"Overseas Studies should be an academic opportu
nity that Stanford provides to everyone, as long as
you meet the language requirements and academic
standards. If there's space, a student ought to be let
in."
With plans to move students out of isolated villas
and into families and apartments, the only space con
straint appears to be in the Oxford program.
"The Oxford city council limits
us to 51 beds," Padgett said. She ex
plained that in all the programs but
Oxford and Florence, many Stan
ford students can live with families
or in dormitories with local stu
dents.
"This makes the number of stu
dents that can participate elastic,"
added Moran. "Having 30 to 60 stu
dents in most programs keeps the
right center of academic gravity.

"It's a more intimate academic
situation overseas, with smaller
classes than at Stanford," he said.
"This is a benefit for faculty too.
They get to meet students and work
with smaller groups. It's good for
morale, for camaraderie."
"When the programs were estab
lished 25 years ago," explained
Padgett, "hardly anyone had been
overseas. The highly controlled
'enclave' model was good. Now half
of the entering class has been over
seas, so Overseas Studies has to serve
different needs."
In this trend toward living with
the locals, Stanford will not renew
the lease on the Florentine villa
when it expires in 1987-88. The stu
dents will live instead in downtown

Florence, where they will attend
classes.
According to both Padgett and
Moran, all these changes in the
overseas program will take a few
years to put into effect. "Impact
takes a long time," Moran said. By
the 1987-88 school year, "there will
be new programs and better pro
grams overseas. They'll be more in
tellectually interesting," he said.
"Eventually the program will be
more open to students," Padgett

said.
Overseas officials are working to
make the course work more attractive
to students. "Now there are only
general studies courses at our
centers," she said. "We are missing
advanced courses in the humanities
and courses for science and engi
neering students. This is less appeal
ing to Stanford students than it was
10 years ago.
"The courses in the programs are
now aimed at sophomores. In Berlin
we want a seminar on Nazi Ger
many as opposed to general courses
on German history. We want more
in the area of VTSS (Values, Tech
nology, Science and Society). Now
we think of visiting Europe as going
back in time. We'd like science stu

dents to see how European countries
are facing industrialization. We
want to show that we can learn from
Europe too."
Officials want to improve ties with
the overseas universities. "We're
working toward more reciprocity,"
said Moran. "We would like col
laborative relationships with other
universities. But we'd have better
relationships if we bring something
positive to the intellectual environ
ment. A Stanford professor could

teach local students. This is a new
approach we're going to take, and it
also makes Stanford look good."
"We'd like to have local students
and local professors at the center,
too," continued Padgett. "We could
have joint all-day seminars on cross
national themes. We've had a sum
mer program in Oxford on compara
tive legal systems, and next we're
doing comparative medical systems.
"Our trend is toward more highly
focused summer programs on con
temporary themes — with no lan
guage requirement. That way more
engineering and science students
can go, since they're so locked into
their schedules during the year."

Padgett also explained how the
bureaucratic process has been im
proved."We don't want students to
have this sense that going overseas
and the whole procedure is too mys
terious and complicated. It should
be as easy as getting a library card to
check out books from Meyer Li
brary.

"We don't want going to a Stan
ford overseas campus to be just a
tourist experience, though," she
said. "We will still require
transcripts and have language re
quirements. "
Padgett added that next year's stu
dents "will essentially be filling out a
reservation slip" up to a year in ad
vance.
This early admission process will
also allow students who are not on
financial aid enough lead time to

plan ahead to save money for the
trip. Although attending Stanford
Overseas costs the same as attending
Stanford in Palo Alto — with identi
cal financial aid benefits — the
plane fare, which Overseas Studies
used to subsidize, will now be left to
the student.
In exchange for losing the air
transport subsidy, explained Padgett,
all overseas field trips, optional in
the past, will be included in the
package.
