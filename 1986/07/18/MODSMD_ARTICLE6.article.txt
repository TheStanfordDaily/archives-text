Paris in springtime. A tour of Tours. Fiori from
Firenze. The real Viennese Ball. Sound appealing?
Can't wait to order? Wait, folks, that's not all! Stan
ford's Overseas Studies can now offer you the world,
or at least more of it than before.
It is all part of Overseas Studies' new direction.
Since last September, when a new administration
took over, the goals of Overseas Studies as well as its
plans for the programs themselves have changed.
The new director, Law Prof. Thomas Heller, has
made his top priority the development of programs
in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Japan, ac
cording to Nancy Padgett, the program's deputy
director.
"I think the old program was terrific,'' Padgett said,
"but I think the new programs have grown up to meet
present students' needs.
"We have a pilot program in Krakow, Poland, this
summer. The program in Latin America will have a
public service component like health care delivery
and will include an internship or a group visit to a vil
lage with a professor. There are already plans to set
up the Japanese program in Kyoto. It will include
both traditional study and a section on technology
and innovation.

"We are trying to become less Euro-centered," she
said.
Dan Moran, one of the academic program officers,
said he believes that this development of new over
seas centers will create opportunities for more stu
dents and more professors to go abroad.
"The locations of the new centers were chosen
based on constituencies in Stanford students and fac
ulty," Moran said. "Before, there was nowhere for
Asian Studies majors to go â€” or experts in Latin
American fields."
Moran said another part of the program's new phil
osophy involves enlarging overseas programs to allow
more students to participate. "At present the Paris
program is. limited to 20 people," he said. "Who
decided that? There is no reason to limit the number
of students.
"Overseas Studies should be an academic opportu
nity that Stanford provides to everyone, as long as
you meet the language requirements and academic
standards. If there's space, a student ought to be let
in."
With plans to move students out of isolated villas
and into families and apartments, the only space con
straint appears to be in the Oxford program.
