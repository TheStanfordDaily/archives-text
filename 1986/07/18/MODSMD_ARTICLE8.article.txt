# Reagan Library debate goes on
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Planners for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
and residents living near the proposed building site con
tinue to disagree over the library's location and its rela
tionship to a controversial public affars center.
The Stanford Foothills Residents Group, represent
ing homeowners near the planned site, has cited three
problems. First, the library will cause traffic and parking
problems. Second, its location in the foothills is on land
valuable for future academic use. And finally, the group
suspects a tie between the library and the much debated
public affairs center, according to Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Anthony Siegman.
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation
met Wednesday primarily to discuss fund-raising at
tempts and the design of the complex, according to
Senior Hoover Fellow Martin Anderson. He would not
comment on specific items on the meeting s agenda.
Anderson, secretary for the foundation's board of trus
tees, acknowledged yesterday that people have expressed
some concern over future traffic problems.
But when the homeowners see a report compiled by
the Stanford Planning Department, "their concerns will
be ameliorated," Anderson said.
The report concludes that there will be no noticeable
traffic problems, Anderson said. It predicts a 3 percent
increase in traffic, he added.
But Siegman disagreed with the report's conclusion
that there would be no serious problems. "Three per
cent of 17,000 cars is still a lot of cars," he said.
Currently, the Foothills Residents Group has plans to
circulate a petition addressing its concern over the li
brary site.

Siegman said the residents group is particularly con
cerned that the library will be located in the foothills be
cause a plan for expansion of that area is not yet com
pleted.
"The whole foothills area is very sensitive. Academic
activities could expand into it," Siegman said.
The University, however, contends the library is of
significant academic value, according to Hoover Ar
chivist Charles Palm, who serves as liaison between the
University and the library foundation.
The University addressed the potential loss of lands
before it approved the library site, Palm said. The library
is a major gain, and the University has reserved the foot
hills for this type of structure, he said.
Siegman also expressed concern over plans for a 350-
seat auditorium at the library and cited it as an example
of possible ties between the library and the public affairs
center.
"Why have a 350-seat auditorium? There are not
supposed to be large public functions there," he said.
According to Palm, the auditorium is in the library
plan at the request of the University Board of Trustees. It
will serve as a classroom for graduate and undergraduate
students and is meant to maximize the usefulness of the
library, he said.
"The library will not be a public affairs center," Palm
said, adding that the federal government will decide
who has access to the auditorium.
In 1983 the University decided to deny the library
foundation permission to build the Ronald Reagan
Public Affairs Center on Stanford land unless the center
would fall under University governance. Since then, the
library foundation has sought an alternative site in the
San Francisco Peninsula area near the Reagan Library.
The foundation has the matter under review, Ander
son said. It is considering a number of possible sites, but
no decision has been made, he added.
