# USW, officials meet, air complaints
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
Representatives of the United Stanford
Workers (USW) voiced complaints about the un
ion's underrepresentation at University hearings
and the union's access to the workplace in a
meeting with University officials Tuesday.
University labor relations officials dismissed
these claims, charging that the USW has not
been adhering to the terms of its contract on these
issues.
At Tuesday's meeting, USW Assoc. Staff
Counsel Mary Ann Tenuto cited the University's
"unfair and intimidating" practices at discipli
nary, investigative and grievance hearings.
Under the terms of the contract, union mem
bers are allowed to bring one other person
from the union to join them at grievance
hearings, whereas University representation at
hearings can vary depending on the circum
stances of the case, University Staff Counsel Pris
cilla Wheeler explained. At the minimum, an

employee's immediate supervisor is present at the
hearing, Wheeler said.
The excess of University representation at
hearings is an unfair and intimidating factor in
the hearing process, Tenuto said. For example,
some disciplinary hearings have three to four
managers "ganging up on an employee," she said.
Wheeler described Tuesday's meeting as ini
tially non-productive, but said it developed into a
"good exchange of opinions."
"Even when we disagree, it is important to keep
the lines of communication open," she said.
Tenuto said the meeting revealed that the
USW and the University do not have as many dis
agreements as the union had previously thought,
especially on the issue of union access to the
workplace.
USW representatives at the meeting also
accused the University of threatening a union
representative who attempted to conduct union
business during work hours, Tenuto said.
Several weeks ago, USW Field Representative
William Di Vita came into conflict with super

visors at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) over his presence at the center during
work hours. Union Secretary Dennis Blake told
The Daily earlier this month that Di Vita had a
legitimate right to be on the premises because he
was filing a first-step grievance against SLAC on
behalf of a union employee.
Douglas Dupen, director of personnel at
SLAC, said a cause of the union's convp\an\\s
could be that SLAC "is a tighter-knit organiza
tion" than the rest of the University. "We're
trying to live up to the letter of the contract,"
while union representatives are abusing its terms,
Dupen said.
The terms of the contract require that USW
representatives make appointments to file first
step grievances, according to Dupen. The union
"cannot just barge into the workplace," he said.
Tenuto said the majority of the union's com
plaints involved conflicts at SLAC. Otherwise,
she said "there is a constructive relationship be
tween employee relations and the union on
campus."
