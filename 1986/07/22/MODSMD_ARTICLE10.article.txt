# Knock apartheid or else, Reagan told
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Senate will pass a measure later this week
aimed at forcing stiff economic sanctions against South Africa unless Presi
dent Reagan's speech today contains "some new credible initiative" to fight
apartheid, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) warned Reagan at a
White House meeting.
At the same time, the symbolic centerpiece of Reagan's revamped policy
toward South Africa collapsed as businessman Robert Brown withdrew his
candidacy as the first black ambassador to the white-ruled country. In a press
conference in his home state of North Carolina, Brown said that he wanted
to spare further "painful" publicity for himself and his family as questions
surfaced about his past business dealings.
As a result, the White House was left scrambling for ways to demonstrate
a new toughness toward the white-ruled Pretoria regime without embracing
economic sanctions and abandoning its controversial policy of "constructive
engagement," which seeks to change South Africa's racial policies through
diplomatic rather than confrontational means.
In the White House meeting, Reagan was told by three leading Republi
can senators that the status quo was no longer acceptable. Sen. Richard
Lugar (R-Ind.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
urged Reagan to scrap the "constructive engagement" policy and to consider
a graduated course of economic sanctions taken in concert with Great Brit
ain and the Common Market.
In addition, Lugar proposed some immediate punitive steps, such as ban
ning landing rights for South African Airways and restricting travel visas.
Such modest sanctions, which appeared in an early draft of Reagan's
speech, are still being considered.
Sen, Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) suggested that Reagan take a
strong rhetorical stand on certain key points in the battle against South
Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, and to push those points per
sonally with South African President Pieter Botha.
