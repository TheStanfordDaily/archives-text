Cranston decries political judgeships
WASHINGTON — Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), accusing Pres
ident Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 of attempting to
"pack" the federal courts with right-wing extremists, urged the Senate
yesterday to investigate nominees more thoroughly and to rely on legal
scholars and bipartisan commissions in recommending judges.
In a strongly worded Senate floor speech, which an aide said
Cranston has been working on since late last year, the senator said an
ideological extremist —■ from either side of the political spectrum —
"can create a doctrinal conflict of interest fully as inapprop/iate as a
financial conflict of interest."
Cranston delivered his speech the same week as a vote is expected
on whether the Senate should reconsider the controversial nomina
tion of Daniel Manion to the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago.
Critics have attacked Manion for his praise of the right-wing John
Birch Society and have charged that the Indiana lawyer is not
qualified for the judgeship. His nomination has escalated into a test of
will for Reagan and his authority in judicial nominations, as well as
the center of a battle over whether the Senate has an obligation to
maintain ideological balance on the federal bench.
Rehnquist backed Jim Crow laws
WASHINGTON — A lawyer who clerked with William Rehnquist
at the Supreme Court in the 1950s said yesterday that Rehnquist
strongly defended the "separate but equal" doctrine underpinning ra
cial segregation in conversations among the clerks.
The former clerk, Donald Cronson, indicated that Rehnquist often
argued that the doctrine, enunciated by the Court in an 1896 case
called Plessy vs. Ferguson, was correct at luncheon meetings of the
clerks in the days before the 1954 decision declaring it unconstitu
tional.
Cronson added, however, that "I think the whole issue is a silly
issue." He said he regarded it as completely irrelevant to Rehnquist's
qualifications, more than 30 years later, to become Chief Justice of
the United States.
"All this was gone into ad nauseam when Justice Rehnquist was first
confirmed (in 1971)," Cronson, now an international lawyer based in
Switzerland, said in a telephone interview. "It's very much res
judicata (a matter already decided)."
HUD disputes black poverty claim
SAN FRANCISCO — Angrily disputing statistics on black poverty
cited by the National Urban League president, Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. said yesterday blacks are
better off now than before President Reagan came into office.
"It's very hard for me to say mathematically or statistically, but
(blacks) have more opportunity now than they had before because the
economy was just not that good,'' Pierce said at a news conference
after a luncheon address to the National Urban League.
National Urban League President John Jacob, in his keynote speech
on Sunday, said blacks have not shared in the economic growth over
the past six years. He sharply attacked the "new selfishness" of Ameri
can society and called for a renewed commitment to helping the poor
and defending civil rights.
