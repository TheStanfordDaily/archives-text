Apartheid stance irks queen
LONDON — As Britain's streets were decorated
with flags and finery yesterday in anticipation of to
morrow's royal wedding, both the monarchy and the
government were distracted by escalating controversy
over South Africa that politicians warned was
heading toward a "constitutional crisis."
At a news conference called to discuss wedding
plans of her son Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson,
Queen Elizabeth's press spokesman was besieged
with questions about reports that she is unhappy with
the way Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is hand
ling disagreements between Britain and its Common
wealth allies over the imposition of sanctions against
Pretoria.
"I am not here to answer questions about that sub
ject," spokesman Michael Shea said repeatedly.
Following a new series of press reports in the past
two days alleging the queen's distress and citing
"unimpeachable" sources close to the palace, Enoch
Powell, a constitutional expert and member of Parlia
ment, charged that dissident "dirty dogs" in
Thatcher's own Conservative Party had planted the
stories to discredit the government.
Citing the limited powers of the crown, deter
mined when Britain fought a civil war over the issue
in the 17th century, Powell said it was
"inconceivable . . . that the sovereign should have
expressed an opinion, or allowed an opinion to be ex
pressed, which was at variance with the advice she
received from her constitutional ministers."
The Commonwealth "crisis," and its growing in
trusion into domestic politics here, is likely to get

worse before it gets better. Three more countries said
yesterday that they will not attend the quadrennial
Commonwealth Games scheduled to begin in Scot
land Thursday. With the addition of the Seychelles,
Cyprus and Sri Lanka, 27 of the Commonwealth's 49
member nations now have announced boycotts of the
games in protest of Thatcher's refusal to consider
comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.
Bolivia optimistic on raids
LA PAZ, Bolivia — The Bolivian government said
yesterday that its joint anti-drug operation with U.S.
military forces had "broken the back" of the illegal
cocaine industry in Bolivia, although only one labo
ratory has been found in four days of raids.
At the same time, opposition criticism to the pres
ence of 160 U.S. military personnel and a fleet of six
U.S. Black Hawk helicopters is rising. Oscar
Zamora, president of the Bolivian Senate, called a
meeting today of a congressional commission that
meets while the full Congress is in recess to discuss
the presence of U.S. military forces without congres
sional approval.
In spite of limited results achieved by the joint op
eration since it was launched Friday, Minister of In
formation Herman Antelo told a press conference
that the major cocaine traffickers are "on the run."
But he added that the "destruction of the bases of
the drug traffickers" is going to be a "long-term oper
ation for which Bolivia will need a lot of external
help."
