The University of California's decision to divest all of its stock in
companies that do business in South Africa — $2.4 billion worth — is
a curious one.
Until last week, UC pursued an investment policy similar to Stan
ford's, namely selective divestment, which both schools have pursued
rather meekly. UC's decision to shift its policy prompts, us to question
whether selective divestment is indeed the correct approach.
On Wednesday, Gov. George Deukmejian reversed his earlier
stand and encouraged the state government and the UC system to take
measures to fully divest from South Africa. His announcement came
just two days before the University Board of Regents met to review
UC's year-old case-by-case selective divestment policy.
Simply because UC divested does not compel us to do so, but this
very big and sudden step cannot help but force us to look at our own
selective divestment policy.
The University's stance that selective divestment is the best route is
not enough to ensure that it is correct. Nor is divesting a mere $9,900
of Newmont Mining stock, which is all that Stanford has divested
from its $182 million portfolio.
It seems that Stanford has taken the word "selective" a bit too
seriously.
If the University's Commission on Investment Responsibility is
indeed actively pursuing selective divestment, can we not ask that it
inform us of what is going on. All we can see is a lot of talk and very
little action.
We strongly urge that the University stick to its ultimatum that if
Diamond Shamrock Petroleum does not dispose of its interests in
South Africa by Oct. 1, Stanford will dispose of its $400,000 of stock
in that company. Also, we ask that the University community be kept
abreast of the investigation of Schlumberger, a corporation of which
the University holds $3.5 million of stock.
If we are to take the University seriously, it must first take divest
ment seriously. If selective divestment is the best policy, the Univer
sity has yet to prove it.
More assertive measures must be taken, and fast.
If selective divestment is the answer, then please, go for it.
