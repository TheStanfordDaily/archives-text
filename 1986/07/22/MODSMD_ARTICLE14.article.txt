Butterfly questions
The following is an open letter to
Dennis Murphy, a University re
search associate in biological sciences
in charge of Waste Management's
program to preserve the Bay Check
erspot Butterfly.
Dear Dr. Murphy:
I am one of the attorneys who
represented SCRAP, a group of
Morgan Hill residents opposed to
Waste Management's landfill proj
ect in nearby Kirby Canyon. I am
pulled in two directions by press
reports regarding plans for the Bay
Checkerspot Butterfly, which Waste
Management has employed you to
oversee.
SCRAP based its case on the
landfill's threat to the butterfly, a
species described in the Environ
mental Impact Report as one "of
great concern to scientists," whose
"numbers were on the decline"
when the Kirby Canyon colony was
discovered and for which official lis
ting as an endangered species has
been sought. As a person who put
much personal effort in trying to
protect the butterfly from the
landfill, I would like to believe the
optimistic predictions for your pro
gram. As one who has carefully read
the EIR, 1 have no reason to believe
these predictions, and I fear that you
may be basing your opinions on
other than scientific analysis. Your
answers to the following questions
will help to reduce my uncertainty.
• Prior to being hired by Waste
Management, did you play any part
in petitioning the government to list
the butterfly as an endangered
species?
• Is the Kirby Canyon colony the
last major colony of the Bay Check
erspot Butterfly?
• Was survival of the butterfly in
"immediate jeopardy" prior to the
landfill project, which may disturb
187 acres of butterfly habitat, i.e.,
38 percent of the total 492 acres of
habitat identified at Kirbv Canyon?

• Physical sightings of the butterfly
have been made at Kirby Canyon,
but the EIR only "estimates" that
there are 1,392 acres of habitat off
site — ascertained by "mapping the
relative density of the four principal
Bay Checkerspot resource plants."
This method apparently reduces the
estimated proportion of habitat
destroyed to only 10 percent of the
total habitat existing. Have physical
sightings of the butterfly been made
on any of this additional acreage?
• A news article cites you as stating
that the butterfly's future may be
brighter than before the landfill
project because: (a) 250 acres of
prime habitat will be enclosed and
never disturbed, (b) livestock grazing
will be controlled to allow maxi
mum production of the native plants
on which the butterfly feeds, and (c)
when the prime habitat being ex
cavated for garbage dumping is
filled, those native plants will be
reintroduced.
If the 250 acres to be left un
touched is meant as a final preserve
in case other efforts don't work, what
reason is there to believe that it will
be large enough to protect the
species against the specific extremes
of natural, adverse events which
cyclically or catastrophically assault
it? How was 250 acres determined to
be the appropriate size for this area?
• The news article states "Murphy
also believes it is possible to
transplant portions of the butterfly
colony to areas in Coyote Valley
where formations of serpentine rocks
support growth of the butterfly's food
plants." But, the EIR reports that
"dispersal of wildlife species to adja
cent off-site areas will not, for most
species, be a viable option.''
Which prediction is correct, and
why? If the Coyote Valley areas can
be expected to support additional
butterfly colonies in the future,
have colonies not already been es
tablished there over the eons in
which the butterfly has existed?
