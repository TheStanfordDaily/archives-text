# Oh, to be in the movies!
## 
### 
I recently gained an insight into the film industry
which, I feel, allows me to commiserate with actors on
the big screen. It isn't all glory, you know. It happened
the day I made a movie.
Now, I like movies more than most people. I love to
escape from daily drudgery through film, anything from
a mindless James Bond flick to a "thinking" movie like
"The Terminator." And I fantasize as much as anyone
about being a film idol, sharing in the fame and
recognition that goes along with being a movie star.

Imagine my excitement then when my friend Steve,
who I knew had been taking film classes at Stanford,
called me up last week and asked me if I would like to
star in his final project â€” a genuine 16mm movie.
"Steve," I said, "I can't believe it. This is so nice of
you to ask."
Steve seemed surprised at my enthusiasm.
"Er . . . sure thing," he said. "No big deal." He and
his "film crew" would pick me up the next morning at
nine, he said.
"What kind of a role is it?" I asked.
"Kind of a Marlon Brando type thing, you know. See
you tomorrow."
The next morning I rose early and shaved carefully.
Steve drove by half an hour late.
"I have my leather jacket," I said. "And some sun
glasses."
"Great, great," said Steve. He introduced me to two
women from his class he had brought along to help and
his 11-year-old brother Charles, who was sitting in the
back seat frowning.
"Charles is going to be in the movie too," Steve ex
plained.

"Hello Charles," I said brightly.
"I have a headache," said Charles.
Steve announced we would film a number of scenes
on a bike path by Lucille M. Nixon Elementary School.
We arrived and as he and his assistants set up the camera
tripod I asked Steve about my script.
"No script," said Steve, fishing in his back pack for
film, "l oo hard to deal with sound."
"But," I said. "My character? Kind of Marlon
Brando?"
"Look," said Steve, showing me a notebook sketch.
"Here's what happens: You stand there, by the tree."
"In my leather jacket?" I asked. "And my sunglasses?"
"Sure," said Steve. "And then Charles walks down
the path and you accost him. Then we start a new
scene, and you're holding him upside down by the
ankles and shaking him."
"What? Why?"
"The film is called School Bully.' You're the bully."
"And what happens after that?"
"That's it," explained Steve. "It's only two minutes
long. In black and white."
I did it. It took about four hours total. We did the
scene where I hold Charles by the ankles four or five
times. The gag was that loose change would fall out of
his pockets which I, the bully, would myself pocket.
Charles didn't like being held upside down and began to
holler at every take. I began sweating under the hot sun
in my leather jacket.
"Put me down," Charles began to scream. "Put me
down, put me down."
"One more time, Charles," Steve said. "You were
out of focus. "
Passing cars honked as they passed by. Steve thought
it was all very funny.
"OK," he finally said. "That about wraps it. Did you
have fun?"
It was enlightening," I said. We started packing
equipment in the car. I turned to Charles.
"Did you have fun?" I asked.
"My head hurts," said Charles.
