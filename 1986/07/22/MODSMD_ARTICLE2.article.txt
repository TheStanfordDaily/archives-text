# Farm reacts to divestment
## UC decision won't have impact here, officials say 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer With wire reports 
Stanford officials say the University of California
regents' decision Friday to divest of the system's $3.1 bil
lion invested in companies that do business in South
Africa will have little immediate impact on Stanford's
investment posture.
But Stanford anti-apartheid protesters say the move
will fuel their demonstrations against the University's
investment policy and may influence the Stanford
Board of Trustees to totally divest of Stanford's $182
million of South Africa-related stock.
Bob Freelen, University vice president for Public Af
fairs, called the amount divested "impressive in magni
tude," but said the decision was not a result of convinc
ing new thinking that would affect Stanford's position.
"This vote, judging by reports in the paper, doesn't
further arguments pro or con on the subject," Freelen
said. "This, in our view, doesn't further the argument
one way or another. "
Stanford maintains a policy of selective divestment
from companies that have not adhered to certain prin
ciples of operation and employment in South Africa.
The trustees voted in May for divestment of $9,900 of
stock in Newmont Mining, marking the first time Stan
ford has divested because of a company's performance in
South Africa.
Freelen said the University is not convinced by argu
ments that an investment portfolio including stock in
companies doing business in South Africa is a financial
liability.
"The (Stanford) treasurer is always sensitive to any
analysis that would suggest a South Africa-free portfolio
would be superior," Freelen said.
Political Science Prof. Richard Brodv, chairman of

the University's Commission on Investment Responsi
bility, said he was puzzled by the UC system's apparent
disregard for the fact that many of the companies that do
business in South Africa are also sponsors of university
research.
"A university is not like other investors," Brody said.
"Many companies in their portfolios are also . . . cor
porate partners. They help fund research, they endow
professorships, they help fund any number of university
programs. It's unclear whether (UC) will cut itself off
from that funding."
University President Donald Kennedy refused to
comment yesterday.
But Stanford Out of South Africa, a student anti
apartheid protest group, is "elated" by the regents' vote,
SOSA member Mike Schmitz said yesterday.
"(The vote) is very significant in terms of adding mo
mentum to the divestment movement," Schmitz said.
"(The Stanford administration) likes to be portrayed for
their very liberal position, but when (California Gov.
George) Deukmejian — who you would portray as a
very conservative Republican — calls for divestment,
you see exactly where they stand."
Schmitz said the UC decision will likely put a great
deal of pressure on the Stanford trustees, who he said
have been using Berkeley's investment policy as a
"shield" for their own.
He said Stanford demonstrators will intensify pressure
when the school year begins in September by focusing
their protest on specific companies.
7 he 13-9 vote on UC divestment came two days after
Deukmejian announced in a letter to the regents a
reversal of his position on. divgsfment invest
ments in South Africa-related companies. Deukmejian,
an ex officio regent, encouraged the board to vote for di
