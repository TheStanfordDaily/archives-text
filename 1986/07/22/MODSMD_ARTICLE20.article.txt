DEAR BUG ME: Beyond the Business
School near Campus Drive lies an ancient foun
dation bleaching in the sun. Who built this once
mighty temple and why? What enormous
cataclysm destroyed it?
— Alaric
DEAR ALARIC: Having complete faith in
your conviction that such ruins really exist right
here at Stanford, we daringly donned our ar
chaeological dig gear and four-wheeled out to
the alleged site. Not long after leaving our vehi
cle we stumbled across the foundation resting
peacefully in the savannah just north of Frost
Amphitheatre. What of such great importance
could have existed here so many years ago?
In conducting our thorough investigation,
we discovered that the bleaching cement foun
dation in the configuration of the
letter "E," must have been constructed as
part of a message to the gods above. But what
could it mean? In further exploration of the
relic, we bumped into some apples hanging
from a lone apple tree. Of course, Eden! Fi
nally the location of that famed paradise has
been determined. How lucky that the Univer
sity now occupies the exact location where man
first gave in to temptation years ago. With this
great discovery under our belts, we went di
rectly to the University Archives to make per
manent our historic achievement.
It seems as though University Archives has a
slightly different explanation for the ancient
foundation. Robin Chandler, archive special
ist, provided material from early Stanford
magazines that proved our theory incorrect.
The June 1903 issue of The Stanford Alumnus
reports that a spectacular gymnasium, in the
shape of the letter "E," was to be built in the ex
act location of said ruins. "The finest gym
nasium in the United States" was to face oppo
site the Stanford Museum, and"the facades of
the two buildings would greatly resemble each
other."
This building, known as the "New Gym,"
was the replacement for the "Old Gym," a
beloved though temporary structure built in
1892. The New Gym contained bowling alleys,
handball courts and an indoor pool, in addition
to all of the standard gym fare. Sadly the New
Gym met its horrible fate in 1906 with the great
earthquake. It was demolished beyond repair

and later removed, leaving only the foundation
to lie bleaching in the sun.
DEAR BUG ME: Give us all the informa
tion you can about the newly planted tree by the
clock tower — the one with the fabulous red blos
soms. Who chose that tree? Is it from some far
off land? Tell us all.
— The Balona Club Gardening Committee
DEAR BALONEY: As usual, we conducted
an on-site inspection of the subject of interest.
This tree, standing alone in the clock tower
courtyard, did not strike us as particularly
fabulous (it was not flowering), but it did have
an unusual leaf shape. However, for a more in
formed opinion, we contacted the University's
Department of Operations, Maintenance and
Utilities. Larry Atwater, grounds supervisor for
the academic portions of the University, in
formed us that the tree is commonly referred to
as a coral tree. The particular variety of coral
tree at the clock tower is fast-growing and does
particularly well in the Stanford climate. At
water said that the tree had already flowered
this spring, but that its leaves alone "are spec
tacular."
Apparently, the idea to plant this tree was
that of Herb Fong, head grounds supervisor at
the University. Fong told us that the particular
variety of tree at the clocktower is of the genus
erythrina and is a native of Mexico. Fong also
explained that the University currently has
three more of these coral trees, which will soon
be planted at other sites around the campus.
One of the coral trees will replace a bay tree in
the Old Union courtyard. That particular tree is

of the genus coffra and is a native of South
Africa. (This genus has recently experienced
defoliation on the Berkeley campus.) Fong has
not yet decided upon the sites for the other two
trees.
DEAR BUG ME: What's the history of the
house called Alta Vista on Junipero Serra
Boulevard, now the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences.
— Chauncey Gardner
DEAR CHAUNCEY: Tired from our previ
ous explorations, we decided to forgo the trek to
the foothills and instead relaxed in the placid
setting of the University Archives, reading old
copies of the several different Stanford
magazines. The first mention of Alta Vista ap
pears in the October 1899 issue of The Stanford
Alumnus with the mention that "work of con
struction has begun on a handsome residence
near the stock farm, to be occupied by Mrs.
Stanford's brother, Charles Lathrop." Lathrop,
brother of Leland's wife Jane, was the business
manager for the University at the turn of the
century, Chandler said. The Lathrop family oc
cupied the house until the 19505, according to
the June 1954 issue of The Stanford Review.
Next to a photograph of a half-demolished Alta
Vista, a caption reads, "END OF A MAN
SION — 'Alta Vista' for more than half a cen
tury the home of the Charles Lathrop family, is
coming down to make room for a new multi
million-dollar Ford Foundation study site."
Today this "new'' Alta Vista houses the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Science.
