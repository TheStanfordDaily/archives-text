## 'Mona' wavers with quality 
### FELICIA WONG Staff writer 
Lots of things about "Mona Lisa" are just right. All
the parts are there: twisted relationships and sordid char
acters; good and often great dramatic performances;
lush, inventive cinematography. Why then does the
film as a whole, despite moments of piercing bitterness,
stumble as much as it soars?
The fault does not lie with Bob Hoskins, who plays
George, the film's dominating character who uses a
tough exterior to conceal a romantic soul. Nor does it lie
with newcomer Cathy Tyson, the cold and well-heeled
prostitute Simone. Perhaps then the film's uneven plot
development and hit-and-miss symbolism prevent it
from becoming the haunting tale that it should be.

She was formed by the ugly
beatings and heroine addiction
of London streetwalking. . . .

"Moila Lisa" is a film in which degenerate relation
ships pile one on top of the other until the entire pres
sure cooker explodes. George, who is out of prison,
rejected by his wife and not allowed to see his 15-year
old daughter, accepts the job of Simone's
driver/protector from his old boss, Mortwell (Michael
Caine). The ex-con, who yearns for love, watches
Simone work London's elegant West End hotels, and
his original dislike for her turns into a combination of
filial protectiveness and romantic affection. Simone's
sultry allure, however, is an illusion. She was formed by
the ugly beatings and heroine addiction of London
streetwalking, and neither chic clothing nor expensive
hotels can change her steely core.
Both George and Simone are employed and con
trolled by Mortwell, a slimy character who sells and
deals in drugs and women. His presence in the film,
though necessary, is problematic. For instance, why
does Simone insist that she does not work for Mortwell
when it is clear that she does? Why does Mortwell insist
that George take pictures of Simone "at work?" To what

degree is Mortwell in league with Anderson, Simone's
former pimp? Obviously, Mortwell is the movie's pup
peteer, controlling the other characters like marionettes.
But exactly which characters he has on a string, and
why, is uncertain. Admittedly, Mortwell's network of
underworld characters is nebulous, but this does not
mean that the film's portrayal of this network should be
so.
A simple solution to this problem could be exposition
— dialogue between the characters that furnishes neces
sary information. However, screenwriters Neil Jordan
and David Leland have opted for metaphoric rather
than explanatory dialogue. One of the film's early se
quences could easily contain enough exposition to settle
doubts, but instead it is full of tales about angels and
white rabbits. Although the originality of this type of
writing creates intriguing characters, a balance between
metaphor and explanation is lacking.
Jordan, who directed and co-wrote the film, leans
toward the mythical and symbolic, which can be either
marvelously effective or simply heavy-handed. When
George and his long-time buddy Thomas (Robbie
Coltrane) spin tales of dwarfs and white horses, the myth
is magical because it exists in the imaginations of two
working-class men. However, when the symbolic white
horse actually appears during a crucial scene in the film,
the mythic element becomes leaden. In a gritty film like
"Mona Lisa," fantasy is much more effective when it
does not walk in front of the camera. And although the
symbol of the Mona Lisa — the mysterious, smiling, il
lusory woman — is a good one, must George play tapes
of the song in his car, and must the Da Vinci painting
smile at us from a refrigerator?
The film's eerie surrealism is better-handled in its
lush cinematography than in its heavy symbolism. The
camerawork in ''Mona Lisa" is excellent; the repeated
scenes of King's Cross, the street of London prostitutes,
are haunting. Also, one shot of Simone and George in
an elevator manages to be aesthetically electrifying
while enhancing the fearful situation. A final shot of
George on the Brighton boardwalk sweeps around him,
brilliantly increasing his confusion.
So, is "Mona Lisa's" cup half-full or half-empty? If
you are willing to excuse its faults, then its technical ex
cellence and outstanding performances make it
worthwhile. However, stay away if you are disappointed
by the thought of a film that could have been brilliant
but somehow misses.

Jordan, who directed and co-wrote the film, leans
toward the mythical and symbolic, which can be either
marvelously effective or simply heavy-handed. When
George and his long-time buddy Thomas (Robbie
Coltrane) spin tales of dwarfs and white horses, the myth
is magical because it exists in the imaginations of two
working-class men. However, when the symbolic white
horse actually appears during a crucial scene in the film,
the mythic element becomes leaden. In a gritty film like
"Mona Lisa," fantasy is much more effective when it
does not walk in front of the camera. And although the
symbol of the Mona Lisa — the mysterious, smiling, il
lusory woman — is a good one, must George play tapes
of the song in his car, and must the Da Vinci painting
smile at us from a refrigerator?
The film's eerie surrealism is better-handled in its
lush cinematography than in its heavy symbolism. The
camerawork in ''Mona Lisa" is excellent; the repeated
scenes of King's Cross, the street of London prostitutes,
are haunting. Also, one shot of Simone and George in
an elevator manages to be aesthetically electrifying
while enhancing the fearful situation. A final shot of
George on the Brighton boardwalk sweeps around him,
brilliantly increasing his confusion.
So, is "Mona Lisa's" cup half-full or half-empty? If
you are willing to excuse its faults, then its technical ex
cellence and outstanding performances make it
worthwhile. However, stay away if you are disappointed
by the thought of a film that could have been brilliant
but somehow misses.
