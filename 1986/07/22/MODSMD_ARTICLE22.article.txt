# If this be the Oasis: I'll take the desert
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Whenever I speak to Stanford
students about San Francisco's
nightlife offerings, I am amazed
at the frequency with which the
Oasis (at the corner of 11th and
Folsom) and the Palladium (in
the Haight district) are men
tioned.
The Palladium is simply too
ridiculous a set-up for me even
to take it seriously. When con
fronted with a dance floor filled

with different break dance crews
all clad in coordinated sweat out
fits, I can only laugh long and
loud. So if you are feeling a bit
down or a tad gloomy, go solely
to witness this scene and have a
hearty laugh, then take your good
cheer elsewhere and savor it.
Now, most Stanford students
will most likely agree with me
thus far; however, on the subject
of the Oasis, I suspect our paths
of reasoning will diverge. While
many would not hesitate to give
the Oasis a resounding thumbs
up, I am saving a big, wet, sloppy
raspberry for the owners if I ever
have occasion to meet them.
Why then is the Oasis the
choice of a good percentage of
Stanfordites who brave the San
Francisco night scene? As much

as I would like to call it a simple
matter of unearned publicity, the
actual reason is much more tel
ling and, certainly, more
abrasive.
If you find anything redeeming
in the campus party scene of
packed fraternity scam-a-thons
spinning hideous party music,
then the Oasis could be a noctur
nal godsend for you. As for me,
no thank you!
Although during my most
recent visit the music was more
danceable than usual, it still left a
lot to be desired in the way of
originality. Good clubs hire disc
jockeys that, in addition to
keeping quiet, play more than the
currently hot tunes; they also
draw from old and very new
releases in assembling an interest
ing and eclectic evening of
music.
However, even if the Oasis
pumped the most spectacular
dance music in San Francisco,
the dancing facilities would still
queer the deal. The exterior
dance floor, which is a pool cov
ered by tiles of clear plastic, is
spongy, seam-ridden and un
doubtedly limits how well even
the most accomplished dancers
can move. The interior dance
floor, although small, includes a
staged area that is one of the few
amenities in the Oasis.
All of these dance-related
shortcomings will not bother the
person who enjoys dancing to a
few songs but does not necessarily

monopolize the dance floor. As hard
as it is for me to understand, there
are many people reared on the fra
ternity pick-up tradition who use
dance merely as a means to an end,
all pun intended, rather an end in it
self.
This phenomenon is all too com
mon an occurrence at the Oasis.
After dancing to only a few songs,
many immobile patrons flock to the
roof-top tables that offer a second
story view and a place to savor a
drink while getting acquainted with
whomever.
In other words, this forum of
flirtation is where the real interac
tion takes place. If management

would only hire Chuck Woolery,
they could start a new television sen
sation. A spin-off of "The Love
Connection," the show would be
called "The Yuppie Connection"
and would depict the celebrated
mating rituals of the yuppie in its
natural habitat. Just what television
needs . . . more quality program
ming!
The only intense feeling that
struck me at the Oasis was one of in
sufferable boredom that drove me to
the doors well before closing time.
Nothing unexpected or even
remotely wild occurred. 1 wanted to
take the whole scene, roll it up like
one big tortilla, sprinkle jalapeno
sauce all over it and throw it into a
microwave set on high. Maybe after
a few minutes of this treatment, the
place would have some zing . . . but
I doubt it.
