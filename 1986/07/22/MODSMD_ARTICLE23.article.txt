# 'A Perfect Stranger' is politely pleasant

Where else but in Edwardian
England would one's butler bear the
name Chaucer and one's mother
say, "Like fish!" to mean
"Poppycock!" Written in the late
1970s but set in 1907, "A Perfect
Stranger," performed by the Stan
ford Savoyards, has every element of
an entertaining Edwardian evening.
The musical opens with the
debonair jewel thief Edward Sable,
whose latest plot is to invite himself
to the country manor of Lady
Beatrice Harlston, win the favor of
Julia, Lady Beatrice's daughter, and
then make off with the family
jewels. Naturally nothing goes as
planned, with meddlesome inspec
tors botching things up on one end,
and on the other, Sable's partners
in-crime wondering what's taking
him so long.
The plot, whether enjoyable
despite its predictability or enjoyable
because of its predictability, is not
the musical's brightest spot. The
brightest, perhaps, is that everyone
can sing. Almost everyone is loud
enough, enunciates well, and every
one hits his or her notes exactly.
A 1 so the accompanying piano,
thankfully, does not overpower the
show.
The show's standouts include
Sable, alias Kevin Anderson, a Rob
Lowe look-alike with a marvelous
voice. He is the perfect gentleman
type robber in his dusty salmon
colored velvet riding coat. How
could Julia resist his charms? Lady
Beatrice (Vyna Restell) is a
melodramatic and comic delight, as

she trills her r's and just about every
other letter, too.
The song lyrics as well as the
spoken words are quite clever, and
many of the scenes produce laughs.
Early on, one of the criminals calls
another "a fugitive from the law of
nature." Later at the Harlston
Manor, Lady Beatrice serves a
pineapple-broccoli punch that
Chaucer dutifully collects in a
flower vase when her back is turned.
When Inspector Thornblade
receives a compliment on his man
ners, he discloses that "police is just
one letter away from polite." And
Harry Hercer's dream of being "on
easy street, with hot and cold run
ning champagne" is charming in its
naivete.
While the overture seems in
nocuous and bouncy, the music im
proves from there. The duet be
tween Sable and Julia called "A Per
fect Stranger" is beautiful, with
lovely harmony at the end. "Fifteen
Years of Gossip" is a nice quartet,
and "Help!" sung by Lady Beatrice
and Cora Bagby (Kay Susanne Ar
naudo, another gem) is an inspired
comical complaint about servants
who are "no help at all."
A favorite number is "Maids to
Order," in which the four maids
have intentionally misunderstood
Chaucer's instructions â€” they try to
"make the beds" literally out of lum
ber and "dust the furniture" by
spreading dust on it instead of clean
ing it. Besides the humor they pro
vide, all four maids have wonderful
voices and perform the best dance
sequences. They provide relief and
fun when things are moving slowly.
The sets, from the bars that imply

a jail cell to the mostly white manor
living room, are quite simple,
drawing one's attention to the
performers.
T he costumes are super as each
fits the nature of its wearer's charac
ter. The criminal Brenda dresses up
in black and gold to visit Sable at the
manor and still manages to look
glamorously seedy. We know that
Cora Bagby feels awkward all
dressed up because her hot pink

gloves clash with her peach dress.
The inexperienced Julia's dresses are
rather prim, simple prints with
eyelet trimming. And the inspector
(Charles Jordan, who gives a won
derful characterization and perfor
mance) wears a Sherlock Holmes
cape, as if to bolster his ability.
Overall the production is enjoy
able to watch, although at three
hours, it seems a bit long, particu
larly the first act. Perhaps this night

the longness was only because the
auditorium was overheated. While
not entrancing, this Edwardian mu
sical comedy is entertaining and the
performances are good.
"A Perfect Stranger" will be
Friday and Saturday, July 25-26, at
8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Tickets are $6. 50 general admission
and $4 student/child and are
available at the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice or at the door.
