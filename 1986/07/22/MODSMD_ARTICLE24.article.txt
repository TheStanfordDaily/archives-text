## Basketball refs. faced with a view to a kill 
### 
He steadfastly stood on the endline, peering straight ahead at
the morass of basketball humanity stationed under the back
board. Bodies flew hither, thither and floor. Justice here fre
quently makes its peace via pain. Elbows locate eyesockets.
Femurs find stray groins. It's not pretty.
The man at the endline continues to watch, seemingly un
perturbed — as if nothing may unsettle his steely gaze. He has
seen much ugliness. His name is Marcos Ochoa, Stanford in
tramural referee.

Dressed in the traditional black and white stripes, those tell
tale bars of sports justice, Ochoa has the unenviable task of
meting out basketball laws. His task is not an easy one; he must
systematically sift through the myriad of maiming and decide
which well-placed hacking is worthy of his esteemed whisde.
The players usually grant him many choices. Some choose
the subtle routes. You know, the reach-in foul, the slap of the
shooting hand. Pantywaist stuff.
Others though, usually the bruisers of the paint, find altern
ative, harsher avenues. These guys enjoy maneuvers such as
the two-handed, behind-the-back hammer clamp or maybe

even the dreaded, mercy-mercy scrotal chop. To reiterate, it is
not aesthetically pleasing.
Of course, for a man like Ochoa — a solemn, pleasant lad
from El Paso — fouls are sort of a specialty — something to
admire in a twisted way.
The "unintentional foul on the fast break" and the "foul
after the shot" are two favorites that strike the eye of Ochoa,
who admitted a certain fondness for "the over-the-back" foul as
well.
Still , as much as he likes to flag down a fast-breaking mal
feasant or two, Ochoa consciously, and heaven forbid, neglect
fully lets some go unpunished. The victims, naturally, forgo
the fifth and complain to the court judge.
In the heat of frenetic and kinetic (hey, it rhymes) action,
many of these lamenters forget how to articulate — namely,
they offer a primeval moan or wail, usually accompanied by a
Danny Ainge-type facade.
The minority of complainers opt for vocalized expressions of
thought. After the game, one player responded to Ochoa in
true rapier-like fashion, stating "Why don't you read the
rules." 740 math, 360 verbal.
Yet another, according to Ochoa, risked it all with "Does
that whistle work?" Ouch. Tragically, these are the highlights.
How does Ochoa weather such lashing verbiage? "I don't
pay attention," Ochoa said matter-of-factly. "Through one ear
and out the other."
Ochoa described, the typical complainer as "an average
player who shoots a lot — a self-proclaimed leader on a team
that is usually quite bad."

"He (the perpetual bitcher) wants to be the fiery spokes
man," Ochoa continued. "I pity the man."
Overall though, Ochoa said that most players are "fairly"
understanding and abstain from badgering him — a welcome
omission.
During the summer basketball league, Ochoa and the other
referees work an abbreviated schedule that has them work four
hours a night for three days of the week. Though it's not the
iron-man triathlon, the somewhat arduous time commitment
plays some havoc physically.
"The hours of standing and running tends to wear down on
my feet," Ochoa said. "It (refereeing) gets sort of tiring after
awhile."
Living with verbal and physical pain constantly, does this
Texas El Paso arbitrator ever feel happiness? Is there ever a mo
ment amid the rubble of cascading bodies when this referee
says "Gee, I love life."
On the basketball court Ochoa's time surfaces when a
shooter cans a shot while being fouled. The thrill comes with
the downward flick of his arm — "score the basket." The
scoring team goes crazy.
Despite this joyous occasion, the coup de grace for Ochoa
and probably for most referees is the technical foul, the quin
tessential show of power.
Ochoa has given a "T" for "too many men on the floor" but
has yet to savor the full-fledged scarlet letter "T." That is, a
technical accorded to a player who is overly hostile or abusive.
Ochoa waits eagerly.
May his true happiness arrive soon.

"He (the perpetual bitcher) wants to be the fiery spokes
man," Ochoa continued. "I pity the man."
Overall though, Ochoa said that most players are "fairly"
understanding and abstain from badgering him — a welcome
omission.
During the summer basketball league, Ochoa and the other
referees work an abbreviated schedule that has them work four
hours a night for three days of the week. Though it's not the
iron-man triathlon, the somewhat arduous time commitment
plays some havoc physically.
"The hours of standing and running tends to wear down on
my feet," Ochoa said. "It (refereeing) gets sort of tiring after
awhile."
Living with verbal and physical pain constantly, does this
Texas El Paso arbitrator ever feel happiness? Is there ever a mo
ment amid the rubble of cascading bodies when this referee
says "Gee, I love life."
On the basketball court Ochoa's time surfaces when a
shooter cans a shot while being fouled. The thrill comes with
the downward flick of his arm — "score the basket." The
scoring team goes crazy.
Despite this joyous occasion, the coup de grace for Ochoa
and probably for most referees is the technical foul, the quin
tessential show of power.
Ochoa has given a "T" for "too many men on the floor" but
has yet to savor the full-fledged scarlet letter "T." That is, a
technical accorded to a player who is overly hostile or abusive.
Ochoa waits eagerly.
May his true happiness arrive soon.
