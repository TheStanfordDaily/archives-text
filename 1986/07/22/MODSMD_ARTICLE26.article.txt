# Residents capture thieves
## 
### INDRA SEHDEV 
Three Woodside High School students were
charged with burglary and trespassing Sunday night
after residents at the Sigma Chi fraternity house
stopped and held the students as they attempted to
leave carrying a VCR and a cassette player.
The three entered the house at around 11 p.m.
and apparently tried several doors before succeeding
in opening one.
Junior Jennifer Hart, a third floor resident, said she
heard the three moving a bicycle in the corridor and
the statement, "Hey, we found a room."
Junior Greg Kennedy encountered the suspects as
they made their way to a second floor fire escape.

Seeing the VCR, Kennedy grew suspicious and asked
what had brought them to the house, he said.
Two of the three suspects then attempted to run,
one down the tire escape carrying the VCR. Kennedy
and junior Charles Ahern subdued the two others
amid an exchange of punches and then called Stan
ford police.
Upon arrival at the Stanford police station, two
suspects were charged with burglary, a felony offense,
and the third with trespassing. They were then
released.
The three will face a hearing in San Jose Juvenile
Court before it will be decided whether or not
charges will be pressed.
