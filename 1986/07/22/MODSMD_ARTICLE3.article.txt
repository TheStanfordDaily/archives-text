# Hoover praises Stockdale, class
## 
### MARY K. McDEVITT Editorial staff 
The Hoover Institution Board of
Overseers passed a resolution last
week commending Senior Fellow
James Stockdale and said a class he
offered three years ago "was im
properly canceled by the Stanford
University Philosophy Depart
ment."
The overseers commended Adm.
Stockdale "for his many contribu
tions to the Hoover Institution, to
Stanford University and to stu
dents."
The board passed the resolution at
its annual West Coast meeting

Wednesday at Hoover.
Stockdale taught "Moral Dilem
mas of War and Peace" during the
1983-84 academic year with Philip
Rhinelander, professor emeritus of
philosophy.
More than 100 students and
auditors enrolled in the course that
focused on peace and moral philoso
phy and the role of force in human
affairs. Stockdale and Rhinelander
had expected to teach the course in
the 1985-86 academic year.
Stockdale, who could not be
reached for comment, charged in
September that the Philosophy De
partment had canceled the class be
cause of his ties with Hoover. An in

vestigation by University Provost
James Rosse found no evidence for
the charges "other than (Stockdale's)
own deeply held belief."
But Rosse said in May that the de
partment's treatment of Stockdale
was "unfair in certain respects. ''
Prof. Julius Moravcsik, chairman
of the Philosophy Department, said
yesterday that Stockdale has not ap
plied to the department to renew his
teaching of the course for the 1986-
87 academic year.
Stockdale, an American fighter
pilot who spent eight years as a pris
oner of war in Vietnam, holds the
Congressional Medal of Honor.
A fellow at Hoover for the past
five years, Stockdale wrote "Ten

Years of Reflection" and "A Viet
nam Experience."
He and Rhinelander have co
authored "Conflict and Character,"
which is soon to be published.
Moravcsik said he would like to
see Stockdale teach an undergradu

ate course on his experiences in
Vietnam.
"His reading philosophy books as
a prisoner of war helped him keep
his sanity and give his life
meaning," Moravcsik said. "It's
good for Stanford students to know
about that."
