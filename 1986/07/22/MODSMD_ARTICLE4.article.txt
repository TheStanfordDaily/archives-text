# Stanford cleans up housing act
## 
### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
Stanford housing officials don't care what season it is.
They're whisking up their spring cleaning now.
The University is taking advantage of having fewer
students in dormitories to catch up on repairs and
housekeeping. And it may take all summer or longer for
some residences. Damages to one University house
readied nearly $20,000 last year.
At the same time, the University is playing host to
about )4,000 summer conference visitors. Conferences
run from one night to 10 or 12 weeks. The occupancy of
Stanford housing in the summer months is 50 percent,
which is "very good for summer conference programs,''
said Lois Fariello, conference manager.
Some residences, such as Branner Hall, are closed to
both conference visitors and students so that extensive
repairs can be made. Stern Hall will have electrical work
done, and Florence Moore and Roble will be carpeted.
"No, repairs are not made because of summer confer
ences,' joked Fariello, although often construction in
itiated in the summer stretches into the school year be
cause of delays. Scheduling conferences to avoid inter
fering with repairs is "a juggling act," according to

Fariello.
Summer conference and camp visitors, who include
corporate lawyers and high school cheerleaders, help
decrease student room and board bills, she said. Accord
ing to Fariello, Stanford earns about $4 million from
the conferences, and thjs money goes back into the
room and board accounts.
Keeping the housing open for conferences and stu
dents during the summer also indirectly helps defray
student costs by enabling the Stanford Bookstore and
Tresidder Union, both of which employ students, to
stay open, she said.
Although Stanford cannot advertise its summer con
ference housing, it competes with other schools such as
UC-Berkeley and UCLA for conferences. But Stanford
does not take every group that wants to meet here. Each
conference must have a sponsoring academic depart
ment.
Besides cutting costs, keeping Stanford housing open
during the summer benefits the University community
in other ways, such as "contributing to the academic na
ture and helping to recruit students," Fariello said.
"Conferees have taken admissions material home and
their children come here," she said.
In addition, the departments,
which make money through the tui
tion charged to conference mem
bers, are very enthusiastic about the
program. "Other universities don't
have so much faculty support and
interest," Fariello said.
"It's our chance to show off Stan
ford to the world, and let them see
what a terrific place it is here," she
said.
Generally, the Conference Office
tries to accommodate conference at
tendees as much as possible and
honors any special requests within
limit, Fariello said.
"We do our best to turn their
residences into the most comfortable
possible," she said.
In addition to "excellent food
services," the University makes con
ference members' beds five days a
week and offers bartending,
housekeeping and catering, she said.
"We have one of the best summer
conference programs as far as
services offered," according to
Fariello.
Apparently the effort pays off as
"most guests have very nice things to
say about Stanford and its facilities,"
Fariello said.
In deciding where to house the
various conference members, the
Conference Office strives for effi
ciency. Generally they choose
dorms or houses that have kitchens
or are close to food facilities and
classrooms.
Sports camps typically stay in
large halls, such as Branner or
Toyon, which are near the sports
fields. The two Robert Moore Row
houses are used in conjunction with
Florence Moore Hall for those con
ferences that request single
occupant room housing.
As for student housing, the Uni
versity strives to keep a neighbor
hood atmosphere, said Rodger
Whitney, assistant dean of Student
Affairs. Most of the summer
residences are loeated on the same
side of campus.
Even Hammerskjold, the one
Row house open to students during

the summer, "is about as elose to
that (student housing) area as you
can get," he said.
The combination of dorms, apart
ments and cooperatives has proved
to be efficient for a variety of
reasons, according to Whitney. Stu
dents like the diverse options that
the different residences offer them,
he said.
