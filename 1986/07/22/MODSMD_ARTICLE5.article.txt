### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
The California Labor Com
missioner has dismissed a com
plaint charging that Victor Hill, a
United Stanford Workers mem
ber accused of vandalism, was
fired from his job for filing safety
complaints with the state.
In his claim, Hill states he was
discharged as a University shipper
and receiver for refusing to wear
the required steel-toed shoes.
The University, however, has
said that Hill was discharged
solely for slashing the tires of his
operational manager, Hector Al
len.
The labor commissioner noted
in his concluding statement that
"there is no evidence to support
[Hill's] contention" that he was
discharged because of his refusal
to wear the shoes.
"Indeed, after his refusal (to
wear the shoes), the University
gave him the money to purchase
a new set of shoes," the report
reads.
According to Mary Ann
Tenuto, associate staff counsel
for USW, the process of obtain
ing a new set of shoes for Hill was
not simple.
Tenuto said the University
paid for the new shoes only after
Hill's co-workers staged a protest
and then won Victor's backpay
and new shoes in a grievance
hearing.
The complaint dismissed by
the labor commissioner is one of

three actions against the Univer
sity being pursued by Hill. In an
other complaint, Hill states he
was discharged due to racial dis
crimination. Hill is also pursuing
arbitration procedures with the
University. His hearing is sched
uled for July 29.
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel
for the University, said that al
though the dismissed claim was
peripheral to the University ar
bitration hearing, the University
was pleased that Hill's claim had
been rejected.
USW lawyer Joel Egglcston,
Hill's counsel in the claim, said
he was "shocked" and "really up
set" over the manner in which
the commission investigated the
claim. While the University
received the commission's con
clusions over a week ago, Eggles
ton, Hill and USW representa
tives said yesterday that they have
not yet received the results.
Eggleston said he fears this
delay in notification might hurt
Hill's chance to file an appeal.
There were also "serious
procedural irregularities in the
investigation," he added.
The labor commissioner did
not interview any of Hill's wit
nesses during the investigation,
Eggleston said.
Besides the initial interview
with Hill, the investigator
referred to two other interviews in
his report â€” one with Susan De
Jongh-Kearl, associate staff coun
