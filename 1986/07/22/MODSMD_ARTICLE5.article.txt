# Union member's claim is dismissed
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
The California Labor Com
missioner has dismissed a com
plaint charging that Victor Hill, a
United Stanford Workers mem
ber accused of vandalism, was
fired from his job for filing safety
complaints with the state.
In his claim, Hill states he was
discharged as a University shipper
and receiver for refusing to wear
the required steel-toed shoes.
The University, however, has
said that Hill was discharged
solely for slashing the tires of his
operational manager, Hector Al
len.
The labor commissioner noted
in his concluding statement that
"there is no evidence to support
[Hill's] contention" that he was
discharged because of his refusal
to wear the shoes.
"Indeed, after his refusal (to
wear the shoes), the University
gave him the money to purchase
a new set of shoes," the report
reads.
According to Mary Ann
Tenuto, associate staff counsel
for USW, the process of obtain
ing a new set of shoes for Hill was
not simple.
Tenuto said the University
paid for the new shoes only after
Hill's co-workers staged a protest
and then won Victor's backpay
and new shoes in a grievance
hearing.
The complaint dismissed by
the labor commissioner is one of

three actions against the Univer
sity being pursued by Hill. In an
other complaint, Hill states he
was discharged due to racial dis
crimination. Hill is also pursuing
arbitration procedures with the
University. His hearing is sched
uled for July 29.
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel
for the University, said that al
though the dismissed claim was
peripheral to the University ar
bitration hearing, the University
was pleased that Hill's claim had
been rejected.
USW lawyer Joel Egglcston,
Hill's counsel in the claim, said
he was "shocked" and "really up
set" over the manner in which
the commission investigated the
claim. While the University
received the commission's con
clusions over a week ago, Eggles
ton, Hill and USW representa
tives said yesterday that they have
not yet received the results.
Eggleston said he fears this
delay in notification might hurt
Hill's chance to file an appeal.
There were also "serious
procedural irregularities in the
investigation," he added.
The labor commissioner did
not interview any of Hill's wit
nesses during the investigation,
Eggleston said.
Besides the initial interview
with Hill, the investigator
referred to two other interviews in
his report â€” one with Susan De
Jongh-Kearl, associate staff coun
sel for the University, and another
with Carol Haney, administrative
assistant for the University.
Under a new California statute
created this year, a deputy inves
tigator can use discretion in choos
ing the witnesses interviewed. This
"time-saving" process winds up

being very unfair to the worker, Eg
gleston said.
Tenuto said such an interview
process would lead to a "one-sided
investigation."
In the report, the commissioner
cited the tire-slashing incident as the
cause of Hill's termination and con
cluded that "whether there is a valid
cause for termination under these
circumstances, it is not within the
purview of this agency."

In her interview in the commis
sioner's report, De Jong-Kearl said
Hill was "terminated on Oct. 17,
1985 for slashing the tires of his su
pervisor, Hector Allen and for no
other reason," she said.
"Hill was seen by Hector Allen
crouching beside his car and the
tires were still gushing out air," she
said. She added that the District At
torney's Office urged that charges be
dropped because Hill was not found
with a slashing instrument.
In his claim Hill states that he
made numerous complaints to Cali
fornia's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA)

before being fired, but "OSHA can
not tie any of the complaints to
complainant Hill . . . Eggleston, or
Dave Stevens, shop steward," ac
cording to the labor commissioner's
report.
Tenuto countered that the inves
tigator did not interview Stevens,
who filed the complaints. Com
plaints do not have to go directly to
OSHA to merit an investigation, she
added.
Under the direction of USW

President Tim Johnson, union
members presented a petition last
week to Donald Kennedy calling for
the reinstatement of Hill.
Hill, in response to these develop
ments, said "I am going to fight
[Hector Allen] all the way" and that
it was important that "people like
Hector Allen and (Manager of Em
ployee Relations) Felix Barthelemy
who try to make themselves into dic
tators or gods don't get placed into
positions of power."
