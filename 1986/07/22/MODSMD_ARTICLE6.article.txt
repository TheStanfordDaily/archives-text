### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
The University has invited five
hotel developers to submit
proposals for construction of a
300-room hotel and conference
center on Stanford land near the
intersection of Sand Hill Road
and Highway 280 in Menlo Park,
a University official said yester
day.
Niel Davidson, University
director of Housing Develop
ment, said proposals for develop
ment of the 21-acre center have
been solicited from Hyatt, Mar
riott, Westin, Ritz-Carlton and
Guest Quarters. Final selection
of a developer will be completed
"by the end of the year," he said.
Davidson said the hotel will be
equipped to handle large confer
ences in order to "complement"
the needs of the University.
Before work on the center can
begin, the Menlo Park City

Council must approve a project
proposal submitted to the city by
Stanford and the developer. The
final proposal is not expected to
be ready until sometime in 1987,
Davidson said.
Menlo Park Mayor Pro Tem
Ted Sorenson said he would
welcome the hotel as long as it
"aesthetically fits in and comple
ments the neighborhood."
City Council member Jack
Morris said his position on the
projected development would
"depend on what is proposed."
Although he said he had "no spe
cific guidelines in mind," Morris
explained he would oppose a
hotel proposal that was not
"architecturally sensitive ... to
other development in the area."
Morris also stated he would not
support a development proposal
that would increase "the
likelihood of lots of additional au
tomobile traffic on Sand Hill
Road."
