# Quake prediction possible?
## 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
Scientists may better understand and even predict
earthquakes with the help of data collected by Geo
physics Prof. Mark Zoback and his team of researchers,
who will process test results from a six-inch wide, three
mile deep hole near the San Andreas fault.
The hole, which will be dug in the fall at Cajon Pass
near San Bernardino, will "be critical for earthquake
prediction because it will lead to a better understanding
of how the fault works," Zoback, the leader of the team,
told University News Service.
Geophysics Prof. George Thompson said the $5 mil
lion hole, financed by the National Science Founda
tion, will increase researchers' "basic understanding" of
the fault by enabling them to measure friction, stress,
pore pressure and heat flow over a period of years.
The U.S. Geological Survey will use the hole for
earthquake prediction after the research team has col
lected its data.
Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur will also be working on
the drill hole project. Nur will use seismic velocity to
measure pressure in the pores of the rocks.
Laboratory experiments have suggested that pore pres
sure may change in fault zones before earthquakes;
however, pore pressure can only be measured by lower
ing pressure transducers into wells. If Nur can verify a
hypothesis that claims seismic velocity varies along with

pore pressure, seismic velocity could be used to predict
earthquakes.
In addition to providing research opportunities for 27
scientists from universities and the U.S. Geological Sur
vey, the hole is likely to resolve a question that has
plagued scientists for 15 years: If friction prevents con
tinental plates from moving, then why is there no
evidence of the heat normally associated with friction?
Scientists have long assumed that earthquakes are
caused by friction preventing the Pacific Plate and the
North American Plate from moving against one an
other. When enough pressure accumulates to finally
move the plates, they shift with a violent force causing
an earthquake.
Friction between the two plates should generate
excess heat flows from the rocks. But more than 100 in
dependent tests have failed to show evidence of these
heat flows, according to Thompson.
Thompson said there are two possible explanations
for this paradox. One is that previously undetected flows
of water may eliminate the excess heat flow from rocks
near the surface. By drilling so deeply in Cajon Pass,
scientists can test rocks not affected by water flows,
Thompson said. In addition, "one can actually measure
the stress," he said.
A second explanation for missing heat flows is that
friction does not exist between the two plates in quanti
ties necessary to prevent movement, Thompson said.
