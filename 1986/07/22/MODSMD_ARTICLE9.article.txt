# UPDATE
## Big quake may be imminent 
### 
LOS ANGELES — The series of earthquakes that
has rattled Chalfant Valley near Bishop, Calif., since
July 3, culminating in yesterday morning's temblor
of about 6.1 magnitude, is part of a decade-long in
crease in seismic activity in that area and may be a
precursor of a larger quake there, experts said yester
day.
'The level of seismic activity since 1978 in the
region immediately surrounding the valley has been
about 20 times greater than the level during the pre
vious decade," said geologist Alan Ryall of the Center
for Seismic Studies in Arlington, Va-.
But any link between the quakes near Bishop,
about 225 miles southeast of San Francisco, and the
July 8 temblor in Palm Springs and the July 13 quake
off the coast of San Diego is tenuous at best, seis
mologists said.
"There is a theory that sometimes you get an over
all stress increase in the western United States that
triggers a number of earthquakes in widely separated
areas," according to Ed Corbett of the University of
Nevada at Reno.
But no quake larger than magnitude 7 has ever
been associated with such a wide-scale buildup of
stress, Corbett emphasized.
"But that's only a theory," California Institute of
Technology geologist Lucille Jones said. "No one has
ever been able to show that there is a significant cor
relation. Every time someone sets out to try to find
such a correlation, the studies have shown that the
earthquake process is random."

The Chalfant Valley quakes were probably not
related to the nearby volcanic field around Mam
moth Lakes called the Long Valley caldera, accord
ing to geologist Bruce Bolt of UC-Berkeley. In 1980,
underground flow of molten rock in the caldera was
associated with a series of four magnitude 6
earthquakes.
Aside from the Long Valley caldera, the primary
geological feature of eastern California is a fault zone
characterized by a chain of historical quakes, most of
which averaged magnitude 7 or greater. That region,
stretching from Winnemucca, Nev., south through
the Owens Valley to the Mojave Desert, has been
called the Central Nevada Seismic Belt or the East
California Seismic Belt.
According to geologist Robert Wallace of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park, different segments
of the East California Seismic Belt have been struck
by quakes of magnitude 7 or larger in 1915, 1932,
1954 and 1982.
"The only part of that belt that has not yet been
broken is the segment between the north end of the
1872 fault and (the area of) the 1932 activity in
Nevada," Wallace said.
"We think that this gap is capable of producing a
magnitude 7 quake," Wallace said, "but we haven't
predicted that such a quake will occur."
Further hints that such a quake may occur in the
foreseeable future arise from the pattern of the quakes
that have occurred since 1978, Ryall and Wallace
said.
