## Jury convicts Jerry Whitworth of spying for Soviets 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO — Jerry Whitworth, a retired Navy
communications specialist, was convicted yesterday of being a
Soviet spy in what the government has called one of the most
damaging espionage rings in U.S. history.
Whitworth, 46, also was convicted of income-tax evasion for
failing to pay taxes on the $332,000 that he received from the
Soviets for passing along the military's most valued possession
— its intelligence codes.
U.S. District Judge John Vukasin set sentencing for Aug.
28.
Whitworth faces multiple sentences of life in prison, one for
each of seven counts of spying for the Soviets, plus a maximum
of 17 years for the five income-tax convictions.
The former senior chief petty officer was acquitted of only
one of the indictment's 13 counts, that of possessing a classified

document. FBI agents found the document — a plan for Navy
communications in case of a Middle East war — while search
ing Whitworth's mobile home in Davis, Calif., when he was
arrested June 3, 1985.
Whitworth, who showed little emotion during the three
and-a-half-month trial, remained stone-faced as the verdict
was read. Asst. U.S. Attorney William "Buck" Farmer smiled
and softly pounded the counsel table.
Jurors, who deliberated a total of 52 hours over 10 days, left
the federal courthouse here without commenting.
U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said the government will
seek the maximum sentence. Russoniello noted that Whit
worth could be eligible for parole in 35 years and again called
for reinstatement of the death penalty for convicted spies.
In Washington, John Martin, chief of the Justice Depart

ment's internal security section, said, "I'm satisfied that justice
has been done.
Whitworth's lawyer, James Larson, maintained that the true
culprit was John Walker Jr., the espionage ring leader, who
turned government witness and testified against the man he
once called his best friend. Walker last October pleaded guilty
to espionage charges and faces life in prison.
Walker began spying in the winter of 1968 when, as a Navy
radioman, he walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington
and sold a day's worth of codes for the Atlantic submarine fleet
for $1,000.
The trial, which opened March 24 in federal court here,
provided the only public detail of the Walker spy ring, des
cribed by Farmer, the lead prosecutor, as responsible for the
worst "hemorrhage" of military secrets in the nation's history.
