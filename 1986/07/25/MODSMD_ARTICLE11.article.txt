# Reagan's door may open for mild Pretoria sanctions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President Reagan,
declaring that "we haven't closed any doors,"
indicated yesterday that he may not oppose
limited sanctions against South Africa after
all, but White House officials said he was de
termined to veto any punitive or sweeping
sanctions passed by Congress.
The president will exercise the veto, one
senior official said, even though he does not
now have enough votes to sustain one and Re
publican Senate leaders have served notice
that they will defy him and press for enact
ment of tough economic sanctions.
Comments by Reagan and his aides imply
ing that he might acquiesce if Congress passes
mild sanctions reflect an apparent slight shift
in policy. The president was widely criticized

by Republicans and Democrats after strongly
opposing sanctions in a major speech Tuesday
on policy toward the white-ruled Pretoria
regime.
Reagan's vehement stand against harsh
sanctions stems from a deep loyalty to British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and a con
viction that such sanctions would be coun
terproductive and cost him any chance to in
fluence events in South Africa, said the senior
official, interviewed on condition that he not
be identified.
"Ronald Reagan wanted to stand behind
Maggie Thatcher — he didn't want her to
stand alone," the official said. "She stood be
hind him on Libya. And he didn't want to lose
his influence in South Africa. Ronald Reagan

has more clout today in South Africa than
anybody in the world. They'll listen to him.
And, if he approved sanctions, they would
ignore him."
Britain was the only Western ally to support
the American bombing of terrorist strongholds
in Libya on April 14, and Thatcher is the only
Western leader other than Reagan to oppose
sanctions.
Reporters covering a Reagan campaign ap
pearance for Republican candidates in South
Carolina yesterday asked the president
whether the United States might consider im
posing sanctions in concert with its allies.
"We haven't closed any doors," he replied.
Although Reagan did not elaborate, White
House spokesman Larry Speakes drew a dis

tinction between "punitive economic sanc
tions" and other, less harsh sanctions.
Such lesser steps, Speakes said, might in
clude denial of landing rights in the United
States for South African planes and "things
like that"
White House aides wrangled over the con
troversial address for 10 days before Reagan
signed off on a final version, sources said.
Most of Reagan's White House aides advised
him not to deliver it, and at one point a deci
sion to scrap the speech was made. However,
three hours later, sources said, Reagan himself
declared, "We're going ahead."
State Department and National Security
Council officials favored the president's
speech.
