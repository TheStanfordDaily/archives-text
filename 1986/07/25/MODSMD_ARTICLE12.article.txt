Soviets to learn of SALT ll's death
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration has decided to
take another important step toward ending its adherence to the un
ratified SALT' II treaty by telling the Soviet Union that after this fall,
the United States will refuse to discuss compliance with that agree
ment in the Geneva commission set up to monitor arms control pacts.
According to informed sources, this message is being delivered to
the Soviets this week by retired Air Force Gen. Richard Ellis, the
American representative to the Standing Consultative Commission
d ' j m Geneva : which is meeting at the Soviets' request to discuss
President Reagan's May 27 announcement that the United States
would no longer respect SALT 11.
According to one source, Ellis has been instructed to tell the Soviets
that because of Moscow s past behavior" in allegedly violating the
SALT II agreement, "the strategic weapons limitations of obsolete past
agreements are no longer fitting subjects in the SCC."
U.S.-Soviet Mars trip may take off
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union apparently has withdrawn
its objection to a new U.S.-Soviet space-cooperation agreement, an
action that could pave the way to a joint project to gather samples from
the surface of Mars with a U.S. spacecraft and to return the material in
a Soviet rocket, several U.S. officials said yesterday.
Considerable diplomatic as well as scientific work remains to be
done, the officials cautioned, but a broad new U.S.-Soviet agreement
on peaceful space ventures could be signed at the next summit
meeting of President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Raold Sagdeev, director of the space research institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, has told several U.S. government and univer
sity scientists that Moscow no longer insists on an end to the Reagan
Administration's space defense program, the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, before concluding a new government-to-government agreement
to resume peaceful space cooperation.
