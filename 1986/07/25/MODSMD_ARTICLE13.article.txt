Rehnquist's past challenged
WASHINGTON — Three men yesterday con
tradicted the account Supreme Court justice
William Rehnquist gave during his 1971 confirma
tion hearings of the role he played in a controversial
Republican "ballot security" program in Phoenix,
Ariz., in the early 19605.
Rehnquist, who is President Reagan's nominee for
chief justice of the United States, had said he was in
overall charge of the programs, but declared that he
never personally engaged in challenging the creden
tials or literacy of Democratic minority voters.
But two of the witnesses interviewed yesterday said
that they saw Rehnquist challenging black and
Hispanic voters in Phoenix. The third, a former assis
tant U.S. attorney who was sent to one precinct to in
vestigate complaints of harassment, said Rehnquist
was definitely a member of a group that was
"aggressively challenging minority voters by looking
at them coming up in line and saying, 'You don't
know how to read.' "
The former prosecutor James Brosnahan, now a
senior partner in a San Francisco law firm, said he
had no doubt that it was Rehnquist he saw and that it
was not a case of "mistaken identity" as the majority
report of the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested
in 1971 when the charges were first aired.
Brosnahan was emphatic in attacking the
"mistaken identity" suggestion.
Rehnquist could not be reached for comment.
Rehnquist's Senate confirmation hearings are
scheduled to Begin Tuesday.

Dry South to get federal aid
President Reagan posed for pictures with farmers
in drought-ravaged South Carolina yesterday, prais
ing their mettle, while parts of Dixie got sprinklings
of rain but no real relief from the weeks-old, deadly
dry spell.
In Washington, Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng announced that a special task force will help
speed federal aid to drought-stricken formers. He an
nounced no new initiatives or financial aid, but said
existing programs will be tailored to help farmers
recover from drought losses to crops and livestock.
State officials estimated the drought's price tag at
more than $1.6 billion. South Carolina, Virginia
and Delaware have asked for federal disaster aid.
Authorities in the South say 43 people have died of
the heat this month.
Final dive to Titanic made
WOODS HOLE, Mass. — Scientists in a mini
ature submarine made their final descent to the
Titanic wreckage yesterday with a repaired camera
toting robot and renewed hopes for pictures deep
inside the once splendid luxury liner.
Robert Ballard, chief scientist of the expedition,
said he would maneuver the tethered robot, Jason Jr.,
as far into the ship's interior as possible, according to
Shelley Lauzon, spokeswoman at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution and the project's co
sponsor.
