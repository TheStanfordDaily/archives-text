## The 						Stanford Daily An Independent Newspaper Manion verdict is Senate's mistake 
### 
Finally, the U.S. Senate has ended the long, semi-dramatic saga of
Daniel Manion's nomination to the federal judiciary. In a largely par
tisan vote cast Wednesday, Senators voted by a slim margin to confirm
Manion to the now unfortunate 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Senate and the judiciary Committee spent many taxpaid hours
discussing Manion's qualifications, or rather the lack thereof. As
usual, political maneuvering dominated the pre-votc weeks, with
some Senators threatening to block nominations of future appointees
if Manion were confirmed, and others swapping pro-Manion votes for
promises of judicial favors.
In the end, President Reagan won his battle for Manion's confirma
tion — a contest he termed vital to his prestige as the nation's leader.
So why would a conservative, small-town Indiana lawyer cause
such a furor? Perhaps it was his somewhat sparse qualifications for a
job on the nation's second-highest court.
Manion has never penned a scholarly legal article, which isn't sur
prising considering his writing samples submitted to the Judiciary
Committee were riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. He has
not been a leading counsel in a federal trial, and he's never handled a
case before the U.S. Court of Appeals. He also received the lowest of
three passing ratings from the American Bar Association.
More importantly, he's shown a distressing disregard to judicial pre
cedent. As a state senator, Manion sponsored a bill in 1981 to display
the Ten Commandments in public schools, just two months after the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled a similar act unconstitutional.
Critics have lambasted Reagan for his attempts to "pack" the courts
with conservative ideologues, but ideology is beside the point. Any
astute president would try to place men and women in judicial posi
tions who share his political views.
The real question is: Couldn't Reagan have found a candidate who
is both conservative and competent to sit on the bench? After all, the
7th ITistrict encompasses three large states — Wisconsin, Indiana and
Illinois.
Although Reagan won this test of will, the balance may tip the other
way next time, unless the quality of his nominations improves.
In the meantime, Manion has a long judicial road ahead of him.
Looking on the bright side, he's only 44, and since judges are ap
pointed for life, he'll have 30 years to learn how to spell and adjud
icate.
