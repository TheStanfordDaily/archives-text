# U.S. supported in fight against drugs

It may be the one good thing to conic out of the deaths of two
prominent athletes.
Finally, the United States is cracking down on illegal drug activity.
Increasing numbers of people have been using and abusing cocaine
each year, and addiction to crack, a new form of cocaine that is spe
cially treated for extra potency, is soaring. Drug abuse is no longer a
problem confined to a few big cities.
Moving U.S. soldiers to Bolivia to disrupt the cocaine trade by put
ting cocaine processors out of business is a drastic but necessary step.
President Reagan sent the 160 troops and support personnel under a
directive that lists illegal drugs as a threat to U.S. national security.
The message it sends to Bolivian drug processors, other foreign dealers
and to traffickers and users back home is long overdue. A tough, no
more-games stance is urgently needed.
The United States has been pressing Bolivia to eradicate forcibly its
huge, 90,000-acre coca crop for a long time. But U.S. officials are
beginning to acknowledge that they have almost given up on that goal
— such a task would be too difficult politically for Bolivia.
Bolivia is the world's second largest producer of coca, after Peru,
and though most cocaine has been processed in Colombia, in the last
two years more and more Bolivian workers have been processing the
chemical themselves to increase their profits. Bolivia produces about
100 tons of cocaine per year, an estimated 25 percent of the world's
supply.
President Victor Paz Kstenssoro, who approved U.S. involvement
in efforts to eradicate the production of cocaine, has estimated that
Bolivia would need $100 million in foreign aid annually for several
years to complete the destruction of cocaine production there.
Curbing the problem at its source would be the best solution, but
clearly this battle is too immense for 160 soldiers. Sadly, their latest
maneuvers have brought only limited results.
Cocaine is all too accessible to users and abusers here. One obvious
step on the road to eliminating its presence in the U.S. is to slow the
incoming drug traffic. But taking action as we have in Bolivia isn't
enough.
c need .i comprehensive drug law and enforcement plan. House
Speaker lip O'Neill has proposed a single package of legislation that
calls tor eradicating drug crops, stopping drug shipments and traffick
ers, enforcing drug laws, educating the public and treating drug users.
I his five-pronged attack may crack through the illegal drug organiza
tions.
