# A 						fortune cookie proven wrong

### 
My ignorance of foreign languages and, hence, the
cultures that gave them life struck me forcefully the
other night while eating Chinese food after a long period
of abstaining from it.
Even with the phonetically written names inscribed
on the menu, I found that even the word "mu shi" has
varying pronunciations. (I've always thought one said it
"moo-shoo.") Maneuvering my chopsticks around my
plate presented an even greater challenge than the "say
the name correctly'' game that I had been playing with
the menu.

"Who came up with the idea that anyone could ever
eat anything with two skinny sticks?" I growled as I
dropped my fifth cashew onto my lap. Frustrated, I
quickly forgot the fun 1 once had learning to use
chopsticks 1 5 years ago.
1 hen, they intrigued me. Now, the sense of ac
complishment turned to failure. "Eating with sticks is so
dumb," 1 mumbled under my breath as a piece of
chicken hit the floor. I wondered how chopsticks lost
their fun appeal so easily.
"Maybe it's just these two. I should try another pair."
Slowly (I seem to do everything slowly these days), 1
realized that the problem was mine and not the
chopsticks. My game grew too difficult and 1 was ready
to quit. I he term "poor loser" took on a new meaning as
I watched the waitress nimbly dish up our food with her
chopsticks.
"I bet she can't use a fork as well as I can." Somehow,
the thought failed to console me, as 1 concluded that not
only could she handle a fork with ease, but that she most
likely had better table manners than me, too.

I wondered if she thought eating with a fork was as
silly as I thought eating with chopsticks was. Did she
ever drop her chicken using a fork?
It was always a game for me — eating with chopsticks
and saying "inn shi"-type words, that is. I think that she
honed her English and learned the intricacies of Ameri
can table manners more out of necessity than for sport,
however.
Switching our respective positions, my mind floun
dered at the thought of me in China, working at a ham
burger stand. Not only does the Chinese language lie
well beyond my reach with its multitude of oddly-shaped
characters and need for opera-like intonations, but life
in China, a land so different from ours, would require a
patience and tolerance that is now lacking in my charac
ter. The struggle to assimilate would overwhelm me.
Yet, I see our waitress is still smiling — maybe 1 can
do it.
It's never too late to learn is it? Old dogs do occasion
ally learn new tricks don't they? The label of ignorance
many Americans bear doesn't have to stick does it? Our
small world isn't so wonderful that we can't venture into
or even remain in spheres differing from ours.
As the waitress brought the fortune cookies to the
table, I promised myself that I would be more tolerant,
more accepting of ways different from my own. "I'll
never complain about chopsticks again," I swore
quietly. "And tomorrow I'll go to a Polish restaurant."
My heart swelled with pride as my new found open
mindedness impressed itself upon me, only to shatter as
1 cracked my cookie and found the strange foreboding of
some ancient wise person (who might even have been
Chinese), "The road to Hell is paved with good inten
tions."
I he meaning drained from my promises as the cheer
left my heart. "This will never do," I thought and asked
the waitress if she could show me one more time how to
use the chopsticks. "I need practice," I explained to her.
"And could you tell me, how do you really say 'mil
shi'?"
