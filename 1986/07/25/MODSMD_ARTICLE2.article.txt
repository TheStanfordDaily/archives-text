# USW enters more charges

United Stanford Workers (USW) filed charges with
the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Tuesday
after the University denied the union's request to exam
ine evidence compiled for an upcoming grievance
hearing.
The charges of unfair labor practices filed by the
USW came as a surprise to the University, according to
Felix Barthelemy, manager of Employee Relations.
USW attorneys had requested to see the University's
evidence against Victor Hill, whose grievance procedure
is scheduled to begin next week.
Hill, a shipping and receiving clerk, was fired last Oc
tober when University Stores Manager Hector Allen
accused Hill of slashing his tires. Allen made a citizen's
arrest of Hill, but the charges were dismissed for lack of
evidence March 10 by the Santa Clara County District
Attorney.
Following Hill's dismissal, USW filed a grievance
against the University stating that Hill had been unjustly
fired.
The unfair labor practice charge claims that the Stan

ford legal office refused to allow USW to examine the
tires that Hill allegedly slashed, the reports of tests con
ducted on the tires and the results of investigations con
ducted by the Stanford police.
The University's refusal "has a very damaging effect
on the arbitration process. It's making a joke out of it,"
said Mary Ann Tenuto, USW associate staff counsel.
The University is clearly in the wrong in this case,
Tenuto said.
"Federal law gives the union the right to either look at
or obtain copies of information which is going to be
used against the worker. There is a lot of precedent and
case law," she said.
Barthelemy, who has not yet seen the complaint, said
that the University was not guilty of unfair labor
practices. "The University is required to go first with
their evidence, then the union can challenge it,"he
said. "They get access to all of that evidence in the
course of the hearing.
"To my knowledge, the union has the same informa
tion as the University anyway," Barthelemy added.
