# Cajun repast lacks culinary sharpness

It's difficult to know exactly
what to say about The Louisiana
Purchase, since its most recent
(and in our opinion best) addition
since our visit is a sign: "Wanted:
Cook."

The portions were
very small for the
money, except for
the potato, which
was big and very
good.

Now, that's not to say that the
food was inedible, but it is a far
cry from the Cajun food of New
Orleans. It is lacking something
quite basic and essential to Cajun
cooking â€” spices. Even the bleu

cheese dressing my guest had on
his salad lacked a definite flavor.
And when the entrees range up
wards from $7.95, imitation is
not something to be tolerated.
The ambiance complemented
the food well. While waiting for
our waiter Juan to serve us, we sat
back and listened to the top-40
radio station being pumped into
the dining area. As we searched
for some interesting conversation
to amuse us, we noticed we were
one of four couples in the entire
restaurant, and this was during
the peak dinner hours. "A
romantic place to take a loved
one,' 7 wc joked; and so the even
ing went. Unfortunately for The
Louisiana Purchase, it was the
source of most of our amusement
that evening.
We started the evening with
Seafood Filet Gumbo and Cajun
Boiled Peel and Eat Shrimp.
Both resembled dishes we had
eaten before at other Cajun res
taurants, but both lacked any
spunk. These appetizers were
edible and rather tasty, but were
definitely not from a Cajun
kitchen.
