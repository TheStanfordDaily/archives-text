# Cajun repast lacks culinary sharpness

It's difficult to know exactly
what to say about The Louisiana
Purchase, since its most recent
(and in our opinion best) addition
since our visit is a sign: "Wanted:
Cook."

The portions were
very small for the
money, except for
the potato, which
was big and very
good.

Now, that's not to say that the
food was inedible, but it is a far
cry from the Cajun food of New
Orleans. It is lacking something
quite basic and essential to Cajun
cooking — spices. Even the bleu

cheese dressing my guest had on
his salad lacked a definite flavor.
And when the entrees range up
wards from $7.95, imitation is
not something to be tolerated.
The ambiance complemented
the food well. While waiting for
our waiter Juan to serve us, we sat
back and listened to the top-40
radio station being pumped into
the dining area. As we searched
for some interesting conversation
to amuse us, we noticed we were
one of four couples in the entire
restaurant, and this was during
the peak dinner hours. "A
romantic place to take a loved
one,' 7 wc joked; and so the even
ing went. Unfortunately for The
Louisiana Purchase, it was the
source of most of our amusement
that evening.
We started the evening with
Seafood Filet Gumbo and Cajun
Boiled Peel and Eat Shrimp.
Both resembled dishes we had
eaten before at other Cajun res
taurants, but both lacked any
spunk. These appetizers were
edible and rather tasty, but were
definitely not from a Cajun
kitchen.
While waiting for our main
courses, we munched on the white
bread and two pieces of some type of
nut bread that were thrown into the
basket as well. Since the place had
just opened, it did not yet possess a
liquor license, but we were assured
that liquor would be available
within the next week.
For our entrees, we had Blacken
Redfish and Bourbon Street Stuffed
Crab, two Cajun-sounding dishes, at
least. The fish is served with the res
taurant's very own sauce, and the
crab has seasonings, stuffing and
"New Orleans special spices and
herbs" stuffed into the actual crab
shell.
For starters, the blacken redfish

was really red snapper. It was
overdone, but edible and came with
a baked potato and vegetables
doused in butter. The portions were
very small for the money, except the
potato, which was big and very
good.
By this time during a meal I am
usually stuffed. I am ready to ex
plode. I have once again eaten
much more than I should have, but
willingly forced down the next bite.
Dessert? Not even a thought.
However, this time, dessert was a
particularly attractive alternative.
My guest pointed out that this was
not a very good sign, knowing my
eating habits rather well.
I wanted to like this restaurant, I
really did. I love Cajun food and was
excited that it would soon be close
by. However, the prices here are too
high, the portions are too small, and
the ambiance is nil.
