# 'Vagabound' keeps roving
## 
### NEIL KENNEDY 
Agnes Varda has been making films since the 19505,
when she began on the periphery of that revolution in
cinema known as the French New Wave. Though her
films have always been animated by her radical politics
in general and her feminism in particular, they are more
notable as an ongoing attempt to develop a unique and
personal style of filmmaking, independent of any
schools or movements.
"Vagabond,'' her latest movie, comes to the United
States after winning numerous awards in Europe while
becoming a surprisingly popular success in France. It is a
difficult and rewarding film, superbly crafted but un
compromising in its refusal to provide easy answers to
the obvious questions it raises. While the intransigent
silence, which lies at the heart of "Vagabond," ensures
that its integrity remains intact, there is a price: the film
ultimately repels affection.
"Vagabond" begins at the end with a young woman
frozen to death in a ditch.The rest of the film follows
her wanderings in rural France during the last weeks of
her life. We are told next to nothing about the back
ground of the young woman named Mona (who is su
perbly played by Sandrine Bonnaire). Why she left
home, what she expects to find on the road and what she
wants out of life are questions that go unanswered by
Varda, both the writer and director of the film.
A clue to Varda's purpose is perhaps offered in the
film' s dedication to Nathalie Sarraute, one of the chief
theorists and practitioners of the French "new novel."
Like the "new novelists," Varda eschews all psychologi
cal explanations, at least as far as Mona is concerned.
Instead, we get a meticulous study of surfaces, of ap
pearances. We see Mona tramping across fields, hitch
ing rides, pitching her tent and bunking down alone or
with other marginal sorts. She is even raped one night;
no further reference to the assault is made in the film.
The cumulative effect is to induce a sort of fatalistic fas

cination with the girl — the whole movie seems to be
one long stumble toward the ditch she eventually ends
up in. As another character says of her, she s "not wan
dering, but withering."
Each character Mona encounters reacts differently to
her. A philosophy student turned shepherd warns her
that "absolute freedom is absolute solitude," and goes
back to his family and flock. A female professor (Macha
Meril) befriends her with a ride and a meal, and is then
haunted by her for days afterwards. A Tunisian worker
Mona lives with for a few days is shown badly missing
her after he's forced to turn her out. Some envy her
freedom; none imitate it.

"Vagabond" is ultimately like
a murder mystery without a
motive for the crime — un
satisfying, in a word.

Mona herself remains a question mark. Bonnaire is
just right in the lead role, attracting as much sympathy
as her character's unwashed purposelessness allows. But
Varda is simply too sparing with insight into her crea
tion. We can see that Mona despises those for whom
civilization is soap and that she steals with equal lack of
remorse from both friend and foe. Why? She responds
warmly to animals and children, but is distrustful or in
different with other adults. Why? Political references are
conspicuously absent. Mona speaks bitterly about "the
bosses" once, but that could mean anyone who suggests
a bath. The post-1968 despair of French youth might be
inferred, but can nowhere be confirmed by anything on
screen.
Varda begins the film like any
police melodrama, with the dis
covery of a dead body. But she is
mocking the conventions of
suspense since that is her last con
cession to them. Thus, "Vagabond"
is ultimately like a murder mystery
without a motive for the crime —
unsatisfying, in a word.
Varda directs well throughout.
The terrain of Mona's wanderings is
well realized, as are the people she
meets. The bare trees and slate-gray
skies of winter are nicely

photographed, and the bald fields
and ruined chateaus combine with
the freeways and car radios to
produce the director's desired effect:
the world Mona rejects is not exactly
teeming with meaning either.
But for the quiet competence of
"Vagabond" ever to become truly
moving, the audience must find
Mona at least as interesting as do
those she meets. Not everyone is
completely taken with her, however.
"Your head's empty," the shepherd
tells her. "Got to have something in
it?" she replies. To be a wild child,
meandering aimlessly through fields
and forests, the answer is no. To
support the weight of an entire film,
the answer is "yes."
