Sting
"Bring on the Night"
This here is a live double
album that captures that crack
Dream of the Blue Turtle band
with Sting kicking some
phenomenal musical ass around
Europe. We were hooked with the
funky, jazzy stepped-up version of
the title track merged with "When
the World is Running Down. . . ."
Kenny Kirkland is the hot
keyboard man, and it isn't very far
into the song before his fingers are
screaming along in a tremendous
solo. Sting's voice comes across
powerfully, although — surpris
ingly enough — it does not seem
to rise to the virtuoso form that the
music does. Branford Marsalis
even adds a few moments of rap
before stepping back into his
saxophone wizardry. For the tour,
Sting surrounded himself with the
same set of crack musicians that
he put together for the original
solo album, and together they do
some steaming versions of not
only Sting's solo songs but also
some of his songs with the Police.
There isn't a single egg laid during
the album. It became clear very
quickly that they successfully
merge the musicianship of top

notch jazz artists with the simple,
raw emotion of rock 'n' roli. You ; ii
only find the album in stores with
import sections but it's well worth
the look.
The Smiths
"The Queen is Dead"
★ ★★
At what point has a band "sold
out?" Is it when a group signs with
a big name pop record producer
and accepts more promotional
contracts? Or is it when an ob
jective change in format or image
can be identified such as adapting
a polished studio sound or sporting
new haircuts based on the latest
"in" trend? Who can say for cer
tain? To sell out is probably a
combination of all the above plus
several other factors that all make
the task of avoiding this vice a dif
ficult challenge for serious
musicians. To expand one's mus
ical breadth while also maintain
ing an original sound and a
devoted following (with an average
age above 12) can be a tricky
business.
So far, The Smiths have
managed quite well. New music
from the band (including their
contribution to the "Pretty and
Pink" movie soundtrack) has

managed to retain the original
good sound of their earlier albums
("Hateful of Hollow" and "Meat is
Murder") while avoiding the over
produced, over-played, over
processed character of most main
stream music.
The new 86 LP, "The Queen is
Dead," brings back the ever
welcome and unmatchable
moaning of Morrisey, whose lead
vocals and lyrical wit are earning
the band critical acclaim from
both sides of the Atlantic. The
band commendably continues to
make strong socio-political state
ments (i.e., denouncing stuffy
aristocratic convention and ad
dressing gay rights in the title
track) though some stanzas go a bit
astray: "I want to live. I want to
love. I want to catch something to
be ashamed of."
Other songs like "Cemetery
Gates" and "A Vicar in a Tutu"
are no more than new titles for
vintage upbeat Smiths — happy
ringing guitars and light drums
mixed with Morrisey's magic.
Granted, nothing on the LP differs
radically from older Smith's
music, but why risk spoiling a
good ol' thing?
