# Farm hotel irks neighbors

### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial staff 
The University's recent move to build a
300-room hotel on Sand Hill Road has
sparked concern among some area environ
mentalists and homeowners, who fear the
project heralds "encroaching" development of
the Stanford foothills and potential traffic
problems.
Five major hotel companies were invited by
the University last week to submit proposals
for construction of a hotel and conference
center on a 21-acre stretch of Stanford land
near the intersection of Sand Hill Road and
Highway 280 in Menlo Park.
"It's sad to see more areas filling up," said
Lennie Roberts, legislative advocate for the
Committee for Green Foothills, a Palo Alto
based environmentalist group. "They're
moving the line farther and farther away from
campus."
Calling the foothills "Stanford's crown
jewels,'' Roberts said the spacious lands
around the University should be kept as
"undeveloped" as possible.
Roberts called the 21-acre proposed hotel
site "quite a special area" that serves as "a buf
fer area from (Highway) 280 to Menlo Park."

The proposed hotel complex also "has the
potential of adding traffic problems to Sand
Hill Road," according to Paul Wilson, a
member of the United Menlo Park
Homeowners Group. "Sand Hill is just about
at capacity right now," he said.
Wilson said he is particularly concerned
that traffic from the new hotel might worsen
congestion problems at the intersection of
Sand Hill and Santa Cruz.
"We're confident that [Menlo Park's] con
cerns will be adequately met," said Niel
Davidson, University director of Housing De
velopment. "(Traffic) is a concern of the Uni
versity also."
Before work on the hotel can begin, the
Menlo Park city planning commission must
approve a project proposal submitted to the
city by Stanford and the developer. A final
proposal is not expected until sometime in
1987, Davidson said. After an environmental
impact report on the proposed hotel has been
filed and reviewed, re-zoning of the Sand Hill
site to allow a hotel must be approved by the
Menlo Park City Council.
Although she is "not real optimistic" that
the hotel can be stopped, Roberts said the
Committee for Green Foothills will
likely be "somewhat involved in [the
hotel project's] approval process."
Menlo Park Mayor Pro Tern Fed
Sorenson told The Daily on Mon
day that lie favors development of

the hotel and conference center as
long as it "aesthetically fits in and
complements the neighborhood."
According to Sorenson, the
projected hotel "will be a great
revenue- generator" for Menlo Park.
Serious discussion of developing a
hotel and conference center at the
Sand Hill Road site began about two
years ago.
