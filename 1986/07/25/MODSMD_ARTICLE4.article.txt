# Union challenges SLAC drug busts
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
A flier distributed by United
Stanford Workers (USW) at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) last week charged that San
Mateo County Narcotics Task Force
"informer" James Walker "was hired
by SLAC to spy on workers and
entrap them in illegal activities.''
Walker, an ex-convict, supplied
information to the San Mateo
County Sheriffs Department,
which led to the arrest of three
SLAC workers, according to San
Mateo Police Lt. Alan Johnson.
Walker himself was later arrested on
theft charges at SLAC, Johnson
said.
Two of the three SLAC
employees arrested for alleged minor
drug trafficking and small thefts
have since been fired, Johnson said.
One worker was arrested last
February and another late last
March. The third, SLAC employee
Larry Reid, was arrested last month
and was the only name Johnson
disclosed.
USW attorney James Eggleston
was quoted in the flier as saying that
"using convicted felons to spy on
SLAC employees is the kind of Ges
tapo tactics rejected by responsible
American employers long ago." Eg
gleston was unavailable for further
comment.
Walker was out on probation for
drug dealing when he was first hired
by SLAC in May 1985 as a tempo
rary janitor, Johnson said. Walker
has helped police as a "reliable" in
former in other drug cases, he added.
USW's main complaint against
SLAC is that "SLAC is basing more
credibility 011 a convicted felon who
has a profit motive involved than an
employee who has worked for SLAC
for a number of years," according to
Bill Di Vita, a USW field represen
tative. Johnson said the narcotics
task force buys information and paid
Walker approximately $40 for each
drug or theft item he uncovered.

The USW grievance calls for
reinstatement of the fired workers
with back pay, according to Mary
Ann Tenuto, USW associate staff
counsel.
"They sent him up there (to
SLAC) wired and he had a hidden
recorder," Tenuto said. "He was
planted," she said, based on "his
own testimony."
"We think he was sent in there
specifically to set them up," Tenuto
said.
Di Vita said USW "is not jump
ing behind these people (the fired
workers) 100 percent," but SLAC is
basing its decision on an "unreliable
witness."
Doug Dupen, persorftiel director
at SLAC, denied the entrapment al
legations being brought against
SLAC by the USW. Dupen also
denied the USW flier's statement
that "if SLAC management wants to
terminate you, then all they have to
do is get a confidential informant to
make charges against you. Your fun
damental right to be presumed inno
cent until proven guilty has been
abolished."
Dupen said the narcotics task
force approached SLAC last year
and expressed a concern shared by
SLAC directors that there existed "a
big repository of drug sales and drug
use" at SLAC. They agreed to place
someone inside SLAC "to ferret all
that out," Dupen said. The nar
cotics task force supplied SLAC offi
cials with tape-recorded and first
hand accounts of drug and theft
transactions.
"We cannot keep thieves on our
payroll, no matter what the union
says," Dupen said.
Johnson id he does not regard
SLAC as a major drug ring. He
compared the SLAC arrests to those
of "drunk driving . . . SLAC isn't an
establishment we think is a (drug)
problem."
"The only thing unfortunate was
that he (Walker) became an entre
preneur. That was his downfall,"
Johnson said.
