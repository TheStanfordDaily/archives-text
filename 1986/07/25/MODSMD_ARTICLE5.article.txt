# Philosophy scholars meet
## Quine joins other professors to ponder skepticism 
### YEN-CHI HUANG Staff writer 
Quick quiz: Who are Jean-Paul Sartre,
Martin Heidegger and William van Or
mand Quine? You're correct if you said
they are all famous philosophers. In fact,
these men are the world's most frequently
quoted for references in philosophical
books and articles. The only one still alive
is Quine, now 78, who visited Stanford last
week to discuss some of the major problems
in philosophy. Fellow scholars agree that
he has had perhaps the greatest impact on
current philosophical methodology.
"In recent years, I've found myself the
topic of a lot of literature,'' says Quine. A
scholar in Italy has compiled Quine's biog
raphy, all his publications, and over 900
pages of critiques and commentaries on his
work. "That much attention is both flatter
ing and bewildering," says Quine.
Surprisingly, Quine did not major in

philosophy as an undergraduate at Oberlin
College. Instead he studied mathematics, a
subject he found easy but did not consider a
very stimulating major. And although he
did take some philosophy classes, he recalls
that "they weren't very inspiring."
It was his honors work in mathematical
philosophy that served as a springboard for
the development of the philosophy for
which Quine is known today. Quine credits
Bertrand Russell with his introduction to
mathematical philosophy. Though Russell
was 36 years older than Quine, the two
later became close friends, and Quine's ad
miration for Russell's work has remained
strong over the decades.
"My interest in mathematical philosophy
was a philosophical one," explains Quine.
He hails mathematical philosophy as "the
underpinning of logical thinking." After
graduating from Oberlin, Quine continued
his studies at Harvard University and wrote his
Ph.D. thesis under Alfred Whitehead, author
of "Principia Mathematical'
As a mathematical philosopher and
logician, Quine says he feels he has "left other
domains of philosophy untouched. "
"Philosophy has so many disparate areas,"
says Quine. "There is more intellectual af
finity within mathematics and physics than in
some fields of philosophy." Due in part to this
strong mathematical slant in his work, Quine
has influenced, both directly and indirectly, a
very broad range of philosophical areas.
During their week-long conference on phil
osophy, Quine, Donald Davidson of UC~
Berkeley, Burton Dreben of Harvard and Dag
finn Follesdal of Stanford addressed such top
ics as skepticism, the nature of scientific
evidence and the possibility of having two in
compatible theories imply the same observa
tions. Davidson, Dreben and Follesdal all
studied under Quine at Harvard where he is
now a professor emeritus.
Follesdal, a phenomenologist whose own
primary interests are intentionality and
meaning, says Quine has presented philoso
phy with "challenges that force people to be
more critical in dealing with these notions."
While philosophers have traditionally relied
on introspection to deal with the difficult

question of meaning, Quine has challenged
them "to be more critical in their views on
evidence."
Quine's first philosophical intuitions
emerged during his elementary school years.
Raised in a Congregationalist family in Acron,
Ohio, Quine recalls that at age nine or 10, he
began to doubt his religion. This was particu
larly disturbing to him, since he had been told
that it was "a sin to lose one's faith. " Realizing
that his personal beliefs were indeed rational,
young Quine proclaimed himself an atheist
and shared his thoughts with his peers.
As editor of his high school annual, Quine
envisioned himself as a writer, though his in
terests were not literary. He had also been
taking Latin at school and developed an in
creasing interest in the origin of words.
At Oberlin College, he was torn between
three key interests: linguistics, philosophy and
mathematics. Linguistics at that time was a
relatively undeveloped field. However, with
his interest in etymology, Quine recalls that
the most exciting course he took as an under
graduate was in Old French. He was especially
fascinated with the transitional progression of
Latin into French.
Years later, it was linguistics that prompted
Quine's three interests to reconverge. As a col
lege student in the 19205, studying linguistics
mainly involved taking language courses. But

during the 19505, linguistics expanded to
place greater emphasis on areas such as lan
guage acquisition, meaning and semantics,
largely due to work done by Noam Chomsky.
Quine, however, disagreed from a philosophi
cal standpoint with Chomsky's anti-empiricist
notion of innate ideas. Quine's 1950 article

"Two Dogmas of Empiricism" and "Word
and Object," published in 1960, are among
his most influential works.
So what does such a great philosopher have
to say about the role of philosophy in higher
education today? "I wouldn't settle for a
philosopher-king," says Quine in reference to

Plato's "Republic." "I'm not convinced that
everyone should take a course in philosophy.
It's not for everyone to learn and understand.
Not every student needs philosophy," he ex
plains.
In a good education, students "should be
exposed to how different topics hang to
gether," says Quine. This exposure could
come from a well-taught survey course in phil
osophy or even a good course in the natural
sciences. Quine highly recommends the short
film "Powers of Ten." "Every high school stu
dent should see it,"he says. "Powers of Ten"
is shown in physics classes here at Stanford.
Quine also believes that students could
greatly benefit from a course in elementary
logic, "if it was skillfully enough presented."
When Quine began teaching at Harvard in
1936, there was no course in introductory
logic. His third book, "Elementary Logic,"
was published in 1941 and was intended as a
text for such a class.
Quine says that last week's meeting with his
former students has inspired him to ponder
new issues brought up during his visit to Cali
fornia and to rethink some of his older
theories. Back in Cambridge, Mass., Quine
spends time with his wife, who accompanied
him on his trip, and continues to make prog
ress in important philosophical issues of the
day.
