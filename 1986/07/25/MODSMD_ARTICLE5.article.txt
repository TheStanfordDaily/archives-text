week to discuss some of the major problems
in philosophy. Fellow scholars agree that

College. Instead he studied mathematics, a
subject he found easy but did not consider a
very stimulating major. And although he
did take some philosophy classes, he recalls
that "they weren't very inspiring."
It was his honors work in mathematical
philosophy that served as a springboard for
the development of the philosophy for

He hails mathematical philosophy as "the
underpinning of logical thinking." After
graduating from Oberlin, Quine continued
