The International Strategic Institute at Stanford
(ISIS) has been awarded a $246,000 Mac Arthur Inun
dation grant for a project aimed at fostering stability and
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.
According to John Lewis, chairman of the institute,
the grant will fund the ongoing Project on Peace and
Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region. The project or
ganizes academic exchanges and conferences that exam
ine efforts to "reduce tensions in the (Asia-Pacific)
region, reduce the possibility of war in the Korean
Peninsula [and establish] confidence-building
measures" in the area.
The institute learned it had received the funds a
month ago, but the Mac Arthur Foundation did not for
mally announce the awards until Wednesday, Lewis said.
ISIS began in the mid-70s to form close tics with
Japan and China, and has sought to reach other
countries, specifically "the Soviet Union and Korea . . .
as our own capabilities and strengths developed," said
Lewis, who is the project's director.
The project will host a conference in October in con
junction with the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the

Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Lewis said.
The project "has lots of participants. That's the won
derful thing about Stanford. Depending on the issues,
[we can] draw on a wide range of colleagues," he said.
ISIS is an administrative organization that oversees
the Center for International Security and Arms Control
and the Northeast Asia-United States Forum on Inter
national Policy here. The peace project is a joint effort
of the two organizations.
"A lot of programs study how bad things arc," Lewis
said, adding that ISIS hopes to focus on the positive
things going on in the region.
The Asia-Pacific area has moved into a "historic per
iod of reasonable stability," he said, adding that growth
— both technological and economic — has shifted from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.
"This is a major opportunity for America," lie said.
According to Lewis, the grant will enable the institute
to "keep going for another three years."
ISIS received funds from the MacArthnr Foundation
in 1984 for general work in international security
studies, Lewis said.
The MacArthin Foundation was established by John
D. MacArthnr and his wife, Catherine. It funds fellow
ships and research grants in various areas of scholarship.
