# Senate GOP proffers milder sanctions

WASHINGTON — Senate
Republicans, trying to head off
House-passed legislation requiring
total divestiture of U.S. holdings in
South Africa, yesterday unveiled a
bill that would impose a wide variety
of milder sanctions — including a
ban on South African planes land
ing in the United States.
Democrats instantly condemned
the bill drafted by Sen. Richard
Lugar (R-Ind.) as too weak. A
spokesman said Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.) would try to amend the
measure when it comes before the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, beginning today.
In addition to revoking landing
rights to South African Airways,
Lugar's bill would prohibit the im
ports of steel, uranium, aluminum,
coal and cement from South African
state-owned companies; give the
president new authority to sell U.S.
gold reserves; restrict visas for
employees of the South African gov
ernment or state-owned businesses;
freeze assets of the South African
government or government
employees in U.S. banks; and
restrict new investment in South
African companies that do not rec
ognize the so-called Sullivan Prin
ciples, which guarantee the rights of
black employees.
The bill would also make per
manent existing sanctions imposed
by President Reagan last year, such
as a ban on Krugerrand sales in the
United States.

The president would be given the
authority under Lugar's bill to lift
the sanctions if the South African
government accomplished any two
of the following acts: free black
nationalist Nelson Mandela; lift the
current state of emergency; legalize
all political parties, including the
African National Congress, or
repeal the Homelands Act.
Mark Helmke, Lugar's spokes
man, said the measure imposes
"tough new sanctions that send the
right message to both blacks and
whites in South Africa."
The senator, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee,
drafted the measure in an effort to
dampen growing bipartisan support
for stiffer sanctions — including a
bill passed by the House that would
impose a comprehensive trade em
bargo on South Africa and require
all U.S. companies to leave there
within 180 days after the bill became
law.
Reagan was expected to oppose
Lugar's bill. Helmke said Lugar fas
hioned the measure in hopes that it
would win the support of a two
thirds majority in the Senate, which
would be necessary to override a
presidential veto.
Democrats were particularly dis
appointed that the Lugar measure
does not freeze all South African as
sets in U.S. banks — a measure that
would penalize whites who are
moving their wealth out of South
Africa.
