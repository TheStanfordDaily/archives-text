Duke vetoes bill against AIDS bias
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deukmejian, declaring that
compassion for the victims of AIDS' is not reason enough to rewrite
anti-discrimination laws, announced yesterday his veto of legislation
aimed at preventing AIDS patients from being fired or denied
housing.
The action, which was denounced by the bill's author as "a hysteri
cal invitation to discrimination," was in line with Deukmejian's veto
last year of an equally controversial bill aimed at preventing job dis
crimination against homosexuals.
In both cases, the governor said there was too little evidence that
these groups faced discrimination, and that existing law is sufficient to
protect those who are unfairly fired from their jobs.
Assemblyman Art Agnos (D-San Francisco), a leading advocate of
gay rights issues and author of both measures, said Deukmejian's latest
veto reflects "his extraordinary and incomprehensible isolation from
the world that requires his attention."
Rehnquist to be probed again today
WASHINGTON — Nearly 15 years after he was named to the Su
preme Court, Justice William Rehnquist faces renewed scrutiny today
from the Senate Judiciary Committee on his role in two racially
charged disputes as it determines whether he should be confirmed as
chief justice.
Central to both issues is whether Rehnquist misled senators during
his 1971 confirmation process while testifying about the events, which
occurred more than a quarter-century ago. The first of those issues in
volves a legal memo defending segregation that he wrote as a law clerk
to Justice Robert Jackson in 1952; the other involves his role in a
vigorous challenge to minority voters in Phoenix in the early 19605.
But underlying these factual disputes and Rehnquist's candor is an
issue for which his Democratic foes have had trouble mustering sup
port: that Rehnquist — as the justice furthest out on the conservative
ideological pole — has taken himself out of the "mainstream" of judi
cial thought, making him unfit to serve as chief justice.
About 45 witnesses, most of them opponents, have asked to testify
after Rehnquist undergoes questioning today. However, a favorable
committee recommendation and Senate confirmation in September
now seem certain.
