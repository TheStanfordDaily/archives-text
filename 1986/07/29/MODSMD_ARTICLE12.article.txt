SDI blocks summit road
MOSCOW — Mikhail Gorbachev said yesterday
that he still favors a second superpower summit and
that his next step on arms control will depend on
President Reagan's willingness to compromise on
Star Wars.
The Soviet leader also announced withdrawal of
six Red Army regiments from Afghanistan and of
fered to open negotiations with China on troop
reductions in the Far East.
In a nationally televised speech, Gorbachev said
the Soviet Union wants another summit as agreed in
Geneva last November. But the Soviets have delayed
setting a date, and Gorbachev said: "We resolutely
oppose the interpretation of the accords reached at
the previous meeting in Geneva as reduced to the
promise to have more meetings."
He said the main agreements at the first summit
were to improve the international situation and nor
malize relations between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
Court clips Botha's wings
JOHANNESBURG — The South African Su
preme Court, in a further judicial curtailment of the
government's vast powers under the six-week-old
state of emergency, ruled here yesterday that regional
police commissioners have no authority to make the
legally binding regulations they have widely
imposed.
The precedent-setting decision immediately in
validates many of the hundreds of regulations

imposed by the police under the state of emergency,
such as those banning political meetings, prohibiting
the wearing of anti-government badges and T-shirts,
declaring night curfews, closing areas to non
residents and requiring schoolchildren to attend
classes.
Under the state of emergency, violation of such
regulations is punishable by 10 years in prison and a
fine of about $8,000.
A three-judge panel of the Transvaal provincial
branch of the country's Supreme Court ruled that
President Pieter Botha had exceeded his authority in
delegating to "any person" designated by the national
police commissioner the commissioner's own broad
powers to make regulations enforcing the state of
emergency.
Cuba ups Sandinista ante
HAVANA — Cuba is increasing military aid to
Nicaragua's Sandinista government following a Con
gressional vote for $100 million in new U.S. aid to
anti-Sandinista rebels, a high Cuban official said yes
terday.
The official, Deputy Foreign Minister Ricardo
Alarcon, told foreign reporters that Cuba is "doing
everything in every area" to help the Sandinistas face
an "escalation of U.S. action." But he refused to
specify any increases in Cuban military aid — and he
appeared to hint that Nicaragua did not need much
more of it.
"They have the people, and they have weapons to
equip the people," he said. "I think that they have
what they need to fight."
