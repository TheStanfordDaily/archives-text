Even to his closest aides, President Reagan's speech on South Africa
last week was a disappointment. He sent a single message in his Tues
day talk: there will be no sanctions against the apartheid-ruled
country.
But Reagan's comments seem more and more out of touch with the
situation both here and in South Africa. As the violence increases in
Pretoria, the call for sanctions grows within our own borders.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, introduced a bill yesterday calling for "targeted
sanctions" — measures that are specifically targeted against the South
African government and ruling elite, but that stop short of causing
widespread economic hardship for the country's majority black popu
lation.
The bill includes a ban on landing rights in this country for South
African Airways, a freeze on the Pretoria government's assets in U.S.
banks, a limitation on the number of visas granted to white South
African government officials, a ban on new American investment in
South African companies that do not recognize the so-called Sullivan
Principles, and a limitation on steel, uranium, aluminum, coal and
cement imports from state-owned companies.
Opponents of sanctions, including the president, have in the past
argued that these actions will hurt blacks. Yet by its very nature,
Lugar's bill takes the meat out of that argument. Sanction opponents
have also said that for such action to be effective, it must be a coor
dinated effort with the allies. In the past, the Administration has said
the allies are unwilling to join in such an effort. But now our allies, es
pecially Great Britain, are coming under attack for not taking tougher
stands on Pretoria.
Unfortunately, the Senate may not have time to consider the Lugar
bill because of the August recess. Even if the bill passes, a House-
Senate conference will be necessary to iron out differences between
the Lugar bill and the much more punitive House legislation. Such a
conference would take time that black South Africans simply do not
have.
So, it looks like the ball is in Reagan's court.
The president knows that actions speak louder than words. To sit by
and insist that the South African government dismantle apartheid isn't
enough.
Reagan's executive order imposing limited sanctions on South
Africa expires Sept. 9. The president must issue a new executive
decree that incorporates Lugar's suggestions and actively solicits the
cooperation of the U.S. allies.
On Friday, Reagan told reporters that the Administration "hasn't
closed any doors'' on sanctions. The time is now to open some doors.
