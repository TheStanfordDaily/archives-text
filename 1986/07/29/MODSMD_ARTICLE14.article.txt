'Homosexual' is not
a derogatory word
Stuart Reges has written elo
quently in The Daily in the past.
Not so in his latest journalistic en
deavor, "Sodomy article insensitive"
(July 8).
Reges attacks The Daily in gen
eral and one reporter in particular
for "insensitivity to the gay commu
nity." The charge is baseless, and
his arguments fall flat.
"Homosexual" is not, as Reges
argues, a derogatory term by current
standards. To equate the term with
"Negro" is absurd.
The reporter's use of the Kirk
Cameron comments lauding the
Supreme Court ruling was neither
insensitive nor audacious. It was
fair.
Cameron's feelings are, unfortun
ately, quite representative of a por
tion of the Stanford community. By
including his comments, the
reporter was able to write a balanced
article.
In similar fashion, The New York
Times quoted a city council mem
ber as calling the court's sodomy
ruling "the best decision ever
made." The l imes is not insensitive
to homosexuals. Rather, it seeks,
like The Daily, to be fair and honest
and balanced by reporting more
than one side of the story.
Reges says The Daily reporter
"demonstrates complete ignorance
of gay people . "
On the contrary, Reges
demonstrates his ignorance of jour
nalism.

Student union ideas
Tresidder is about to undergo a
major expansion and renovation,
one that will set the tone of the place
for the next few decades. What we at
the ASSU want to find out is, "Does
this expansion fulfill the needs of the
students?" Tonight, tomorrow and
Thursday students will meet to talk
about this issue that is at the fore
front of ASSU concerns.
Tresidder bases much of its
renovation with the "concerns of
students" in mind. In the past five
years, data compiled from polls in
the forms of questionnaires, tele
phone surveys and student meetings
provided Tresidder with student per
spective on needs within a Union.
The facts have been compiled and
the plan has been formulated.
Though the Tresidder Plan is for
mulated, other initiatives have also
been initiated within the ASSU and
other student groups. The issue of
student governance has always been
a concern, but will it remain as such
for the upcoming year? With the
present renovation plan we see no
improved situation for student con
trol. What we do see is more student
office space, a lounge space with a
fireplace, a larger Coffee House and
Store, and two to three meeting
rooms, all in the control of Tresid
der.
It is important to realize that the
Tresidder Plan is negotiable to an
extent. But before we talk of revi
sions, we would like to discuss the
Tresidder Plan and relevant issues
on improving campus life with you,
the Stanford student community.
