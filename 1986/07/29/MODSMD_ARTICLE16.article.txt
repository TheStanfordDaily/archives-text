# The 						true meaning of symbols
## 
### 
Think back to 10th grade, English class. You've just
read "The Scarlet Letter" and now your teacher is asking
you what the book means.
"A single rose grew from the thorny bush," the teacher
reads, then turns toward the class. "What does the rose
symbolize?"
Did you wonder why you were asked to read books
with an eye toward symbolism? Was any explanation
ever given?

I remember reading a lot of great literature in high
school and having teachers treat the works only as elabo
rate allegories which, after close scrutiny, might reveal
the author's elusive and profound views on the human
condition.
And I remember deciding, based on this method of
analysis, that all great writers wrote by thinking up some
symbols and then constructing a plot around them.
Why, I wondered, does that make a great book great?
Couldn't bad books have symbolism? What's the differ
ence? Why couldn't Hawthorne have written a long es
say explaining his views on morality, ethics and reli
gion, and then write a nice, easily accessible spy thriller?
(It reminds me of my favorite scene from Woody Al
len's "Stardust Memories:" As an audience exits a movie
theater where an "artsy" Bergman-esque film is
showing, one man remark that the Rolls Royce in the
movie "probably represented a car.")
So what was the big deal about literary symbolism —
why not stick with style, plot, characterization (which
were only dealt with in pop quizzes)?
Its not so hard to come up with a satisfactory answer,
of course. Any humanities course — history, English,

psychology — is ultimately seeking answers to the same
questions. The classes are searching for the closest, most
accurate insight toward an understanding of who and
what we all are, what makes us tick, and how various
aspects of life might be improved (or avoided).
One reason great writers are great is that their works
offer these insights, enough so that we see that they have
displayed an understanding of something about life that
we'd like to share.
This may seem rather obvious, but it seems not to hit
a lot of people until their freshman year at college, when
suddenly they find themselves sitting in dormitory halls
until the wee hours, gripping Western Culture books
and arguing about the existence of God.
In such instances, symbolism naturally stems from
the writing, just as symbolism naturally stems from real
life. (What did my mother really mean on the telephone
just now? What did my friend's slip of the tongue indi
cate? etc.)

So what was the big deal about
literary symbolism? . . .

If it becomes apparent, for example, that Shake
speare's understanding of human nature surpasses just
about everybody else's (even Freud sought to correlate
his own views with interpretations of great Shakespear
ean characters) then it is worthwhile to ponder what
Yorick's skull symbolizes, or Macbeth's bloody hands,
or FalstafFs love of life.
Since symbolism stems from great writing, then, and
not the other way around, high school teachers should
put greater stress on why it is necessary to probe for deep
meanings in great works ... I personally think I might
have enjoyed "The Scarlet Letter" a lot more. So there.
