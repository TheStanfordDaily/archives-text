# Designer drugs pose lethal threat to users

Amid recent concern over the
dangers of cocaine use, a group of
synthetic opiates called "designer
drugs" has captured the attention of
Stanford health officials and much
of the medical community.
Designer drugs are similar to
opiates like heroin and morphine,
but they are created in a lab, test
tube or bathtub, according to Dr.
William Hazle, director of the Stan
ford Alcohol and Drug Treatment
Center.
Hazle described these synthetic
drugs as cheap and easy to make.
"One only needs a little knowledge
of biochemistry, and the chemicals
are easy to obtain," he said.
"The danger is that these com
pounds haven't been tried

anywhere," said Dave Rosner, an
administrative assistant at the Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center, whose
research lab investigates designer
drug related illnesses.
When underground chemists
make the drug "there is no quality
control," Rosner said. "Users are the
first line of experimental animals
taking the drug," he added.
According to Dr. Vince
D'Andrea, associate director of Stu
dent Health Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, "no student has
come to Cowell regarding designer
drugs."
"Only a handful of students come
to Cowell each year for drug coun
seling," he said.
D'Andrea expressed concern
"over the lack of student awareness"
