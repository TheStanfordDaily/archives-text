# Designer drugs pose lethal threat to users

Amid recent concern over the
dangers of cocaine use, a group of
synthetic opiates called "designer
drugs" has captured the attention of
Stanford health officials and much
of the medical community.
Designer drugs are similar to
opiates like heroin and morphine,
but they are created in a lab, test
tube or bathtub, according to Dr.
William Hazle, director of the Stan
ford Alcohol and Drug Treatment
Center.
Hazle described these synthetic
drugs as cheap and easy to make.
"One only needs a little knowledge
of biochemistry, and the chemicals
are easy to obtain," he said.
"The danger is that these com
pounds haven't been tried

anywhere," said Dave Rosner, an
administrative assistant at the Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center, whose
research lab investigates designer
drug related illnesses.
When underground chemists
make the drug "there is no quality
control," Rosner said. "Users are the
first line of experimental animals
taking the drug," he added.
According to Dr. Vince
D'Andrea, associate director of Stu
dent Health Services at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, "no student has
come to Cowell regarding designer
drugs."
"Only a handful of students come
to Cowell each year for drug coun
seling," he said.
D'Andrea expressed concern
"over the lack of student awareness"
about drugs and their "reluctance to
discuss publicly the issue of alcohol
and drug use."
With problems such as designer
drugs, ignorance is "what's unfor
tunate because information is what
sets you free," he said.
D'Andrea said Cowell cooperates
with Residential Education to bring
drug programs to students. "(But) if
the students don't take care of what's

going on in their own living situa
tion, our programs won't have much
affect," he said.
This fall Cowell and Res Ed are
planning activities for target groups
such as fraternities and freshmen,
D'Andrea said.
Cowell has received "impressions
from a few students . . . from other
college surveys . . . and from the
national media'' that Ecstasy, a
designer drug, is being used by Stan
ford students, said Doryn Davis-
Chervin, University manager of
Student Health Services.
Cowell recently added Ecstasy

and Adam, another designer drug,
to a student health survey that at
tempts to measure drug use as well
as gather information on other
health issues.
Another problem associated with
designer drugs is that they can be
easily mistaken for the botanical
drugs that they mimic.
Because designer drugs are close
chemical derivatives of botanical
drugs, consumers cannot be sure of
what they are buying, Hazle said.
"People recognize drugs on the
street by their color. Mexican Brown
and China White are two exam
ples." They can't tell the difference
between the "botanical drugs and
the synthetic drugs," he said.
Hazle estimated that five to 10
percent of heroin addicts in the Palo
Alto area are addicted to synthetic

opiates. "Until a couple of years
ago, you didn't have synthetic
opiates,'' Hazle said. Hazle said he
does not expect a dramatic rise in
the use of designer drugs over the
short-term.
"Cocaine-related problems are on
the increase'' and there is a slight in
crease in opium addiction, Hazle
said.
But according to Rosner,
"Designer drugs are definitely on the
rise." The designer drug business is

very lucrative because such drugs
are cheap and relatively simple to
make, he said.
Under the federal Controlled
Substances Act, many of these sub
stances aren't illegal. Under this act,
these slightly altered forms of legal
substances are considered legal until
declared otherwise.
A foreshadowing of the potential
dangers of designer drugs could be a
case investigated by Dr. William
Langston, director of the research

lab at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center. His investigation linked a
bad batch of designer drugs to a
syndrome similar to Parkinson's
disease in heroin addicts.
In this case, the underground
chemist was trying to create an
analogue (synthetic imitation) of
Demeral, and he created the drug
MPrP, which is toxic to brain cells,
Rosner said. This one bad batch has
caused 500 cases of the Parkinson's
like syndrome, he said.
