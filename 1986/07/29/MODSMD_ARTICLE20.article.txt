## Film jargon clouds review 
### NEIL KENNEDY Bernardo Bertolucci" By Robert Phillip Kolker Oxford University Press, $17. 95 
In today's nadir in international cinema,
one case stands out — Italian filmmaker Ber
nardo Bertolucci. Still young (he was born in
1940), gifted unto genius and with an interna
tional reputation for over two decades, Ber
tolucci nevertheless has not made a film in
five years.
Robert Phillip Kolker, a professor at the
University of Maryland and author of two
other well-received studies of contemporary
cinema, has written the first book-length cri
tique of Bertolucci in English. Kolker's book is
a model of informed seriousness. He never
hides his great admiration for Bertolucci,
while never hesitating to make astute
criticisms.

BOOKS

The book's main problem, however, is that
it is soaked in the structuralist, post
structuralist ana deconstructionist jargon that
dominates so much of contemporary film the
ory. "Text" and "discourse" appear almost as
often as "Bertolucci" does, almost to the point
of distraction. Nevertheless, it is a valuable in
troduction to the work of an extraordinarily
talented director.
Bertolucci was born in Parma, the son of a
well known art historian, film critic and poet.
A prodigy in more than one art form, he pub
lished a prize-winning book of poems at 19.
The next year he worked as assistant to another
director and poet, Pier Paulo Pasolini, on the
latter's first film, "Accattone." Under
Pasolini's influence, Bertolucci fell in love
with filmmaking, directed his first short a year
later and declared that he had finished forever
with "poetry written on paper."
"Before the Revolution," Bertolucci's first
feature film, took both its title and its theme
from Talleyrand's famous remark that "those
who did not live before the revolution do not
know the sweetness of life." Loosely adapted
from Stendhal's "The Charterhouse of Parma"
and set in the Parma of the early '60s, it was,
as Bertolucci was later to say all his films were,
"desperately autobiographical."
The film follows a young man, Fabrizio, in
his struggle to reconcile his deeply felt left
wing political sympathies with his equally
strong love of the beauty and pleasure to be
found in the bourgeois world. Much as he
wants to be a Communist militant, Fabrizio is
forced to admit his revolutionary impulses are
hopelessly compromised by an incorrigible
aestheticism and romanticism. He has, he
says, "a nostalgia for the present."
Filmed when Bertolucci was only 22 and
released in 1964, "Before the Revolution" ex
hibited the lyrical sweep that would charac

terize all the director's best work. When Ber
tolucci began his collaboration with
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro in"The
Spider's Strategem" in 1969, Bertolucci's eye
for color and feel for the camera gave the film
the lush, romantic look that makes Ber
tolucci's style one of the most unique and
recognizable in film.
That style found its first mature focus in
"The Conformist," released in 1970. Based on
Alberto Moravia's novel about a minor offi
cial's attempt to impress his Fascist superiors
by assassinating one of his former professors, it
was most notable as an uninhibited feast for
the eye. The film's psycho-sexual speculations
and political lessons were subordinate to Ber
tolucci's dazzling display of modernist chic as
a method of historical recreation. Paris and
Rome of the '30s were brought to life amidst
filtered light and voluptuous shadows, tum
bling leaves and perverse tangos.
With "Last Tango in Paris" in 1972, con
tent caught up with form in Bertolucci's
cinema for the first time. The story of one
man's attempt to separate sex from the rest of
his ruined life, it chronicled his journey from
sadness to savagery and back again with an
honest)' never before seen in film. Pauline
Kael's famous declaration that "Bertolucci and
Brando have altered the face of an art form" in
"Last Tango" was only a little exaggerated — it
was indeed great, brutal art. Brando held the
camera as if by divine right and Bertolucci
proved his camera to be the most distinguished
in modern film. More tragic than erotic, Ber
tolucci's "Last Tango" was truly a dance of
death.
As Kolker points out, the very success of
"Last Tango in Paris" proved to be Bertolucci's
undoing, since it inspired him to embark upon
the filming of "1900." Here the Marxism that
had so often been Bertolucci's muse now
became his master. An international cast was
enrolled to depict what Bertolucci saw as the
heroic role of the Communist Party in Italian
history, then and now. "1900" was intended as
a great political statement meant to infuse the
concept of socialist realism with new life.
Instead, as the film's length and budget
grew, political and legal problems over
whelmed it. Eventually the producers con
fiscated the unedited print, and Bertolucci had
to spend years in litigation to regain artistic
control. This unedifying tale, which Kolker
gives a good account of, should serve as a cau
tionary tale to all directors who dream of any
compromise between visionary cinema and
studio economics. When a shortened version
was finally released in 1977, "1900" fell short
of its creator's expectations, though not before
providing some awesome images of power and
poetry.
Kolker sees the disappointment of "1900" as
the turning point in Bertolucci's career, and
the films that have followed would seem to
bear him out. "Luna" was the sordid story of
an opera singer, bravely played by
Jill Clayburgh, whose discovery of
her teenage son's drug addiction
begins an emotional ordeal for them
both. But the incestuous tension
that was at the heart of the movie
was stampeded by the Freudian for
mulas Bertolucci foisted on his char
acters, and his sweeping
romanticism became frozen in con

templation of "Decline of the West"
decadence.
"Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man"
(1982) marked a further shift. Ber
tolucci's subject was terrorism and
its effect on Italy. But told from the
perspective of a Parma factory owner
whose son has been kidnapped, it
lacked life. While the director's
sharpest observations concerned the
despair and nihilism of Italian
youth, the film itself was anything
but youthful. In fact it seemed Ber
tolucci's first middle-aged movie.
