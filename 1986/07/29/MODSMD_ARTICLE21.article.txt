DEAR BUG ME: Does chewing gum
really prevent your ears from hurting on an
airplane? If so, how and why?
— Dumbo
DEAR DUMBO: You have brought up a
question that is sure to have bugged many
an air traveler, human and pachyderm
alike. To answer this question, we con
sulted Dr. Richard Chaffoo, a professor in
the Department of Otolaryngology at the
Stanford University Medical School, who
furnished us with a very complete answer.

Chaffoo explained that the pain experi
enced in air travel, especially during des
cent, comes from pressure changes affect
ing the Eustachian tube and the enclosed
middle ear space. The Eustachian tube,
part bone and part cartilage, is normally
seven to nine millimeters in diameter and
17 to 18 millimeters in length. The tube
connects the middle ear space with the
throat area just behind the nose.
The main cause of pain during descent is
the increase in cabin pressure leading to
negative pressure within the ear. This pres
sure may partially collapse the tube, upset
ting the equilibrium between the middle
ear space and the external environment.
When these two pressures are significantly
different, pain will result.
Chaffoo noted that chewing gum may be
very helpful in facilitating this equilibri
um, thus relieving the associated pain.
When someone chews, the palate muscles
that surround the Eustachian tube move
vigorously, causing the tube to open and
close and allowing pressure to equalize.
In addition to chewing, swallowing and
yawning are often helpful in offering relief.
Also, the "valsalva maneuver" usually
works to overcome blockage of the tube,
providing quick relief to those who know it.
The valsalva maneuver consists of taking a
deep breath, pinching the nose and closing
the mouth, then attempting to force air out
of the mouth or nose.
Those with upper respiratory illnesses are
often predisposed to experiencing pain
during descent because of swelling in the
areas surrounding the Eustachian tube,
Chaffoo said. These sufferers may find a
decongestant useful in reducing the swell
ing and avoiding the pain.

Chaffoo also noted that infants often ex
perience great pain during descent (as your
ear drums surely have noticed). The
propensity of the problem is due to the Eus
tachian tube not being fully developed in
infancy and/or the infant's inexperience
with the valsalva maneuver.
DEAR BUG ME: Certain grammar
questions have been bugging me since junior
high. What is the equivalent of "whose" for
inanimate objects? For instance, you can
write, "A man whose shirt is blue. . .
But you probably can't write, "A house
whose roof is white. ..." What do you use
instead of whose?
Also, is there a best place for the adverb?
For example, "He drove slowly to Detroit,"
versus "slowly, he drove to Detroit, versus
"he slowly drove to Detroit," versus "he
drove to Detroit, slowly." Or is it a matter
of ear?

DEAR FAILURE: Thank you for such
an interesting question. We receive so
many probing questions here at Bug Me,
usually requiring hours of research and in
vestigation, that it was a pleasure to come
upon an inquiry that could be answered
without leaving the newsroom. Though we
considered answering your questions with
out reference to any grammar guides, our
history of taking great liberties with the En
glish language (though little gets past our
editors) may undermine our credibility.
As for the first question concerning usage
of the word "whose," "Webster's New Col
legiate Dictionary" states that "whose"
means "of or relating to whom or which
(especially) as possessor or possessors . . . ,
agent or agents . . . , or object or objects of
an action." It is perfectly correct to use
"whose" with inanimate objects.
The answer to the inquiry about adverb
placement was found by The Glik, one of
our researchers, in"The Random House
Handbook: Third Edition." The book
specifies that, "although most adverbs
belong immediately before the words they
modify, emphasis and sentence rhythm
may sometimes dictate other positions if
there is no danger of ambiguity."
In the examples you gave, the adverb
placement is purely a matter of style (or
ear), as the meaning of the sentence
remains the same. There are some adverbs
whose placement can drastically change
sentence meaning. And we could endlessly
list examples . . . only we no longer want
to think about them. (Or is that, we no
longer want to think only about them?)
One final note. We are concerned that
these queries of yours have been eating at
you for so many years. Have you been
unable to find help until now? Please write
us if you have any other problems. We
care.

placement was found by The Glik, one of
our researchers, in"The Random House
Handbook: Third Edition." The book
specifies that, "although most adverbs
belong immediately before the words they
modify, emphasis and sentence rhythm
may sometimes dictate other positions if
there is no danger of ambiguity."
In the examples you gave, the adverb
placement is purely a matter of style (or
ear), as the meaning of the sentence
remains the same. There are some adverbs
whose placement can drastically change
sentence meaning. And we could endlessly
list examples . . . only we no longer want
to think about them. (Or is that, we no
longer want to think only about them?)
One final note. We are concerned that
these queries of yours have been eating at
you for so many years. Have you been
unable to find help until now? Please write

DEAR BUG ME: Does chewing gum
really prevent your ears from hurting on an
airplane? If so, how and why?
— Dumbo
DEAR DUMBO: You have brought up a
question that is sure to have bugged many
an air traveler, human and pachyderm
alike. To answer this question, we con
sulted Dr. Richard Chaffoo, a professor in
the Department of Otolaryngology at the
Stanford University Medical School, who
furnished us with a very complete answer.

Chaffoo explained that the pain experi
enced in air travel, especially during des
cent, comes from pressure changes affect
ing the Eustachian tube and the enclosed
middle ear space. The Eustachian tube,
part bone and part cartilage, is normally
seven to nine millimeters in diameter and
17 to 18 millimeters in length. The tube
connects the middle ear space with the
throat area just behind the nose.
The main cause of pain during descent is
the increase in cabin pressure leading to
negative pressure within the ear. This pres
sure may partially collapse the tube, upset
ting the equilibrium between the middle
ear space and the external environment.
When these two pressures are significantly
different, pain will result.
Chaffoo noted that chewing gum may be
very helpful in facilitating this equilibri
um, thus relieving the associated pain.
When someone chews, the palate muscles
that surround the Eustachian tube move
vigorously, causing the tube to open and
close and allowing pressure to equalize.
In addition to chewing, swallowing and
yawning are often helpful in offering relief.
Also, the "valsalva maneuver" usually
works to overcome blockage of the tube,
providing quick relief to those who know it.
The valsalva maneuver consists of taking a
deep breath, pinching the nose and closing
the mouth, then attempting to force air out
of the mouth or nose.
Those with upper respiratory illnesses are
often predisposed to experiencing pain
during descent because of swelling in the
areas surrounding the Eustachian tube,
Chaffoo said. These sufferers may find a
decongestant useful in reducing the swell
ing and avoiding the pain.

Chaffoo also noted that infants often ex
perience great pain during descent (as your
ear drums surely have noticed). The
propensity of the problem is due to the Eus
tachian tube not being fully developed in
infancy and/or the infant's inexperience
with the valsalva maneuver.
DEAR BUG ME: Certain grammar
questions have been bugging me since junior
high. What is the equivalent of "whose" for
inanimate objects? For instance, you can
write, "A man whose shirt is blue. . .
But you probably can't write, "A house
whose roof is white. ..." What do you use
instead of whose?
Also, is there a best place for the adverb?
For example, "He drove slowly to Detroit,"
versus "slowly, he drove to Detroit, versus
"he slowly drove to Detroit," versus "he
drove to Detroit, slowly." Or is it a matter
of ear?
— Freshman English Failure
DEAR FAILURE: Thank you for such
an interesting question. We receive so
many probing questions here at Bug Me,
usually requiring hours of research and in
vestigation, that it was a pleasure to come
upon an inquiry that could be answered
without leaving the newsroom. Though we
considered answering your questions with
out reference to any grammar guides, our
history of taking great liberties with the En
glish language (though little gets past our
editors) may undermine our credibility.
As for the first question concerning usage
of the word "whose," "Webster's New Col
legiate Dictionary" states that "whose"
means "of or relating to whom or which
(especially) as possessor or possessors . . . ,
agent or agents . . . , or object or objects of
an action." It is perfectly correct to use
"whose" with inanimate objects.
The answer to the inquiry about adverb
placement was found by The Glik, one of
our researchers, in"The Random House
Handbook: Third Edition." The book
specifies that, "although most adverbs
belong immediately before the words they
modify, emphasis and sentence rhythm
may sometimes dictate other positions if
there is no danger of ambiguity."
In the examples you gave, the adverb
placement is purely a matter of style (or
