## Clvb DV8, linguistically flawed, but still OK 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
The alley was dark and desolate,
and aside from a few blinking neon
signs, the city was cool and still.
Just a few blocks away the streets
would be lined with groups heading
to one of San Francisco's many
nightspots, but the block of Second
and Howard was deserted.
"Could I have the wrong ad
dress?" I wondered until this solemn
scene was interrupted by the low
self-assured rumbling of a white
limousine that whizzed by and
stopped a few blocks ahead of me,
letting out two couples who imme
diately disappeared into a building.

This occurred three more times
before I reached the landing strip for
all of these chauffeured citygoers.
"What is this ... a nightclub or a
mobster reunion?" I jokingly asked
my companion. We would find out
soon enough.
Thankfully, our anticipation was
transformed into pleasant surprise.
When I first entered CLVB DVB
on Natoma off of Second Street, I
was immediately struck by the
decor. It was the first time I had seen
a club's interior fashioned in an ef
fort to simulate Roman architecture,
and surprisingly enough, it worked.
From the white tableclothes and
large candelabras to the marble-look
dance floor and columns, this motif
was dominant.
With all of this hype, you would
expect the people to be wearing
sheets and lounging around feeding

grapes to each other — not even
close.
Except for two overly zealous
(i.e., obnoxious) patrons, the gen
eral energy level of the crowd was
relatively low, so if you did not bring
any enthusiasm with you, you surely
would not be able to sap any from
the crowd.
Because most of the people in
CLVB DVB came in couples, the
standard "meatmarket" scene was
not rampant. Certainly there were a
few touch and go situations, but the
prowling that usually occurs at most
nightclubs was not in swing. Simply
put, it is an ideally suited place to
bring a date — not hunt for one.
However, if you do intend to in
clude CLVB DVB in your love
plans, you should arrive early and
secure a back corner table or you
will be pounded by hot spotlights all
evening — not the most romantic
situation.
Also, if you enjoy drinking out of
a real glass, take one with you. Even
the shot glasses were tres tacky plas
tic picnicware.
Another observation that I cannot
help making, although I know many
people will call it cocky and
cavalier, was that very few people
had any serious shake on the dance
floor, and the people who did move
did so to the point of overkill. Sorry,
but I call them as I judge them.
One woman in particular spent
the entire evening sloppily leaping
to and fro like a maimed ballerina
while another guy screamed rap
lyrics and banged on his tambourine
with little regard for the actual beat
of the music. 1 can't believe anyone
was sad to see them leave.
To both of these nocturnal
nuisances, The Night Guy say,
"RELAX!!!"
I have tried to think of what could

have inspired these people to such a
frenzied pitch, and I still have not
come up with any conclusive
evidence. But here are a few possi
bilities:
It could have been the music, but
why would anyone's dander get
ruffled over the standard breed of
Top 40 soul and played-out progres
sive tracks? The arrangement cer
tainly did not set any of my hair on
end — if it did, I'd shave it!
Having already discounted the
amount of influence the people

could have played in such an emo
tional upswing, there is only one
remaining explanation for the overly
enthusiastic behavior of these people
— they must have been on drugs.
I don't mean to sound like the
next Jerry Falwell, but I do firmly
believe people should refrain from
drinking too much, especially when
said behavior makes them behave
like asses.
Although these explanations
sound a tad harsh, it would be even
more severe to suggest that these

people behaved like this by nature.
Overall, I think CLVB DVB is
definitely worth the trip even if just
to see a novel set-up. You may even
be amused by certain behavioral
quirks that grated on my nerves.
I'm sure that the fact my favorite
nightclub in the free world is also
called DVB (a.k.a. "Spit" in Bos
ton), did not help CLVB DVB's case
any. There is an outside chance that
I could have been biased, however
slightly, before walking in the door.
I'm only almost human.
