# Van Morrison raves on at the Greek
## Rhythm and Blues slices through the night 
### GREG CAMENZIND 
Van Morrison's performance at the Greek
Theatre in Berkeley Friday night was
no mere "Moondance." On the contrary,
Morrison — singing in his powerful and
distinct "belt em out" style — "raved on" for
over two hours in front of a capacity crowd of
young and old R & B fans.
Morrison has drawn this particular style
from the roots of Rhythm and Blues made fa
mous by such giants as Sam Cooke, James
Brown, Ray Charles and Muddy Waters. Mor
rison aptly revealed his R & B influence by in
viting the legendary John Lee Hooker, one
of the greatest and oldest Blues vocalist
guitarists still around, to open the show with
12 classic songs.
Hooker quickly warmed up the crowd and
his guitar with a variety of Blues tunes such as
"Boom, Boom, Boom, Shoot You Right
Down," "I'm Bad Like Jesse James" and "She
Had the Nerve to Put Me Out." He added to
this a wonderful piece called "I Cover the
Waterfront" — a sad, slow ballad that was
sung soft yet strong enough to arouse a cap
tivating intensity. Hooker also performed a
standard 12-bar Blues tune called "Marty," a
piece that got the crowd clapping and cheering
loud and long enough to bring him out again
for an encore. He responded in a true laid

back fashion, saving, "Only one more 'cause
it's cold out here!"
From there, Hooker fastened his ice and
guitar picks and went off into "Boogie Child,"
a cool and quick song, which Hooker first
played on the "Bines Brothers" soundtrack.

When Van Morrison's band (more like an
orchestra, actually) took the stage, the night
air was cold and dark. The crowd, mostly
made up of fans over 30, was trying to get
comfortable on the concrete steps of the am
phitheater, desperately settling into blankets
for warmth.
The band consisted of a string quartet
(complete with cello and viola), keyboards

(both synthesizer and grand), a lead guitar,
bass drums, two back vocalists, and finally, a
horn section. The band began with an intro
duction of each part of the ensemble, cul
minating in a nice melodic lead-in by the
strings to prompt Morrison into "Got to Go
Back." The opening number was soulful and
had a finely-orchestrated string arrangement.
Morrison immediately broke into an unusual,
improvisational rendition of "Moondance" —
seemingly much to the relief of everyone there
who wondered, "Is he going to do
'Moondance?'
When Morrison started "Vanlose Stair
way," a classic tribute to the greats of R & B
from his "Beautiful Vision" LP, it became evi
dent that he was running a tightly-organized,
fast-paced show. The quality of musicianship
was fairly high throughout the band, and
Morrison himself played an excellent guitar
solo on "Stairway," illustrating that he's not
just all voice and no play.
Unfortunately, there seemed to be a lack of
presence in Morrison's singing. He still had
the bursting volume, but there nonetheless
remained a certain void — perhaps a lack of
the more characteristic Morrison spirit.
Regardless, the audience was still im
measurably pleased with Morrison's singing
while the other members of the band
enchanted the crowd with their instrumental

mastery in every song.
Particularly strong was Morrison's "Celtic
Swing." During this fine instrumental, Mor
rison played a lot of slow, mellow-bellow sax,
and it was clear that the audience was deeply
mesmerized by both Morrison's sax style and
the mystic quality of this composition. Mor
rison's solo melted into the Celtic folk sound
supplied by the quartet as the flute of Pee Wee
Ellis brought the piece to a nice climax.
The alto and soprano sax of band member
Ellis contributed greatly to the sad, reflective
quality of "Haunts of Ancient Peace." Accom
panying this slow, languid piece was a nicely
controlled trumpet and the omnipresent Mor
rison on the keyboards. Together, the sound
swept through in beautiful and lyrical fashion.
During the past few years, Morrison has
written many songs with thematic references
to the Celtic folklore of his native country,
Northern Ireland. Interestingly enough, most
of the songs Morrison performed Friday even
ing were not from his latest album. Much of
the music was drawn from the "Beautiful Vi
sion" album which was recorded in 1982.
The coup de grace of this concert came in
the form of the encore. Morrison's "Rave On
John Donne" was an awe-inspiring, powerful
piece that truly captured the pulse and energy
of Morrison and his band. Rave on, rave on
rave on.
