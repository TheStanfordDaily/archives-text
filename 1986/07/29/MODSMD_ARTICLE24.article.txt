## Red Sox in trouble, but won't collapse again 
### 
Now that Wimbledon is over, there isn t much to write
about besides baseball. Or, of course, the Goodwill Games
.... Let's stick with baseball.
I spent last week in Boston, home of my beloved Red Sox. It
is a city in doubt and crisis.
The Sox surprised everyone (except me) by taking an eight
game lead into the All-Star break. Since then, they've lost eight
of their last 10 to lead the hated Yankees by a mere three games
heading into last night's action.

The Bosox were even swept by the Oakland As — the worst
team in baseball.
Oil Can Admitted to Mass Gen! shrieked the headlines.
Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd, our illustrious sports editor's choice
for the "Check-To-See-If-He-Wet-His-Pants" Award, checked
into Massachusetts General Hospital for medical and drug test
ing. Boyd has the second best record on the Boston pitching

staff at 11-5, but is not the most stable person around.
Half the Boston lineup is hurt — regular shortstop Glenn
Hoffman has been out most of the season, pitchers Bruce Hurst
and Wes Gardener have been hurt, Tony Armas, as always,
has missed a lot of games, and now Jim Rice, having one of his
best years and hitting over .330, is out for some time. First
baseman Bill Buckner can barely walk, let alone run.
Walking around Boston, all I heard was "the Sox are fol
ding," "it was nice while it lasted" and all sorts of other the
end-is-near remarks. A Boston Globe columnist mentioned
that the first five people he saw at a Laundromat that morning
told him it was all over for the Red Sox.
All this with the best pitcher and the best hitter in baseball.
Roger Clemens, the All-Star Most Valuable Player, is 16-2 and
throws 98 mph. Wade Boggs is batting .356 after flirting with
.400 for a few weeks.
I think talk of the Red Sox' demise is a little premature. Rice
will be back in left field soon and hopefully Boyd will be
released from the hospital with whatever problems he had
cleared up. Even with names like LaShelle Tarver and Mike
Stenhouse at the bottom of the order, Boston still has a decent
lineup with Boggs, Baylor and Evans.
Besides, who else will win the division? The Yankees have

won a few games recently, but they lack a shortstop (former
Stanford star Paul Zuvella has been struggling) and Dave Win
field is not playing well and is unhappy with owner George
Steinbrenner. I think the only way New York may have a
chance is if the rumored Winfield for Ozzie Smith deal goes
through.
No one else in the division is strong enough. Baltimore
might be a threat if Eddie Murray were healthy, but Cal Ripkin
can't do it alone. Cleveland seems to be a sentimental favorite,
but come on. The INDIANS?
The year 1978 is the reason everyone has written off the Red
Sox the moment they go into a short road slump. In that fateful
year, Boston watched a 14-game July lead dwindle to nothing.
In the one-day playoff to determine the American League East
champion, the Sox lost to Bucky Dent and the Yankees — a
dark memory for us Bosox fens.
But I will remain optimistic. Perhaps I haven't been around
long enough to be a cynical, pessimistic Red Sox fen. My pre
vious picks still stand, although I admit Texas is looking a little
shaky.
So all you Giants fans who are starting to behave like those
