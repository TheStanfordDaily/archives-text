# Lemond must wait to savor his Tour de France win
## 
### 
PARIS â€” Greg Lemond still hasn't had
time to relish his historic victory in the Tour
de France, which shattered a century of
European dominance.
"Since I've been on the victory stand, it
hasn't really sunk in yet," Lemond said at a
news conference yesterday.
"I was at a team celebration and had about
three hours sleep. I guess when I get away to
be with my wife and family, I will really appre
ciate it,"he said. "It's been tiring both physi
cally and mentally."
Lemond was the first American ever to win
the Tour de France, the most prestigious cy
cling race in the world, since the event started
in 1903. After a 23-day, 2,500-mile course, he
held on to a three-minute, 10-second victory
margin over five-time winner and teammate,
Bernard Hinault, in Sunday's final leg.

"It was by far the most difficult Tour I've
been in. It's a definite letdown after three
weeks of racing and pressure. I hope I
recuperate well," Lemond said.
Lemond will have little time to rest. He
planned to participate in three exhibition races
this week before flying back to the United
States.
He is scheduled to race in the Coors Classic
Aug. 8-24, followed by the World Champion
ships in September, both taking place in
Colorado.
"The World Championships are completely
different. You have to hope everything goes
right on that day to win. No flats. No falls.
You can get sick," he said.
"I would like to see the World Champion
ships judged on a point system like Formula
One racing or skiing."
