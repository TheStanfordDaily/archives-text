# Campus growth evaluated
## Land use permit to be discussed at hearing Aug. 7 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
A Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR),
prepared for the proposed modification of Stanford's
land use permit, has been issued to the public and will
be discussed at an open hearing before the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission on Aug. 7.
The DEIR, compiled by the Berkeley consultant firm
Ira Fink and Associates Inc., evaluates the environmen
tal impact of projected overall growth at Stanford. Such
issues as wildlife, traffic and noise pollution are treated
in the 449-page report, which also outlines the amount
of foreseeable growth between now and the year 2000.
According to the DEIR, the University's 1982-83
daytime population of 27,810 is estimated to grow to
30,520 by the year 2000, an increase of 2,710 in faculty,
staff, students, other employees, visitors, volunteers and
patients. Growth between 1982-83 and 1990 will be at a
rate of 0.8 percent a year, while growth from 1990 until
the end of the century will be at a 0.3 percent rate, ac

cording to the DEIR projections.
The document examines the potential impacts on the
environment that may occur if the land use permit
granted to Stanford by Santa Clara County in 1962 is
modified. According to Stanford Planning Department
Planner/Analyst Charlotte Strem, the DEIR is an at
tempt to make Stanford's 1980 land use plan "consistent
with the county's plan," which has been modified since
the 1962 agreement.
The Aug. 7 meeting of the county planning commis
sion will include an "overview of the EIR (the final en
vironmental impact report) by the consultants," accord
ing to Hugh Graham, Santa Clara County's senior plan
ner. "It's all part of the process for determining the envi
ronmental impact of land use."
Graham said that during the commission's meeting,
"comments will be taken down from the public, and
responses to their questions must be included in the
final EIR that goes to the planning commission."
