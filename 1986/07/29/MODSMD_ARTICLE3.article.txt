# Campus growth evaluated
## Land use permit to be discussed at hearing Aug. 7 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
A Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR),
prepared for the proposed modification of Stanford's
land use permit, has been issued to the public and will
be discussed at an open hearing before the Santa Clara
County Planning Commission on Aug. 7.
The DEIR, compiled by the Berkeley consultant firm
Ira Fink and Associates Inc., evaluates the environmen
tal impact of projected overall growth at Stanford. Such
issues as wildlife, traffic and noise pollution are treated
in the 449-page report, which also outlines the amount
of foreseeable growth between now and the year 2000.
According to the DEIR, the University's 1982-83
daytime population of 27,810 is estimated to grow to
30,520 by the year 2000, an increase of 2,710 in faculty,
staff, students, other employees, visitors, volunteers and
patients. Growth between 1982-83 and 1990 will be at a
rate of 0.8 percent a year, while growth from 1990 until
the end of the century will be at a 0.3 percent rate, ac

cording to the DEIR projections.
The document examines the potential impacts on the
environment that may occur if the land use permit
granted to Stanford by Santa Clara County in 1962 is
modified. According to Stanford Planning Department
Planner/Analyst Charlotte Strem, the DEIR is an at
tempt to make Stanford's 1980 land use plan "consistent
with the county's plan," which has been modified since
the 1962 agreement.
The Aug. 7 meeting of the county planning commis
sion will include an "overview of the EIR (the final en
vironmental impact report) by the consultants," accord
ing to Hugh Graham, Santa Clara County's senior plan
ner. "It's all part of the process for determining the envi
ronmental impact of land use."
Graham said that during the commission's meeting,
"comments will be taken down from the public, and
responses to their questions must be included in the
final EIR that goes to the planning commission."
Both Graham and Strem said they
do expect complaints from members
of the surrounding community con
cerned with development at Stan
ford.
Reduction of the buffer zone be
tween Stanford and Palo Alto, as
well as between Stanford and Menlo
Park, will be one area of concern to
community members, according to
Menlo Park Mayor Pro Tem Ted
Sorenson. He indicated that his gen
eral concern centers around the pos

' sibility of development on Sand Hill
Road from Alpine Road to Stanford
â€¢ Shopping Center and on Alpine
Road to Webb Ranch.
But "Stanford is working the
problems out," Sorenson added.
"I see no major problems in our
negotiations (with the University).
We want to be good neighbors, as
I'm sure Stanford wants to be good
neighbors. There's a lot of give and
take on both sides," he said.
Strem said "it is difficult for I
people to understand the nature of
the EIR," adding that many com
munity members fear the docu
ment's generalities concerning land
development.

"We can't be that specific about
development because it's such a
long time period," Strem said. "The
timing of when the actual building
will be done is still in question,"
since factors such as funding and the
need for the facilities have to be
taken into consideration, she said.
Strem cited the land between Ar
boretum Road and Campus Drive
along Palm Drive as one area of
conflict with community members.
Although the land between Arbore
tum and El Camino Real remains a
buffer zone in the University's pro
posal, Strem said the area between
Arboretum and Campus Drive is
labelled "academic reserve," a desig

nation that provides for develop
ment but also maintains such natu
ral features as indigenous vegetation
and habitat.
According to the Times Tribune,
the Committee for Green Foothills
has voiced its concern that develop
ment along Palm Drive will threaten
the area's integrity.
Strem said she is surprised the
community has focused on the Palm
Drive proposal as an area of com
plaint, since the land there will not
be developed "at least until the year
2000, and it will have a low density
building future."
"We certainly plan to continue
the ceremonial entrance of Palm

Drive, and the health and welfare of
the palm trees is definitely a con
cern," Strem said.
"I can understand why people
might be alarmed, but there's really
no basis for their concern," she
added.
Graham said he thinks any com
munity complaints about environ
mental problems resulting from
Stanford's land development "can
all be mitigated."
According to the DEIR, "once
the final EIR is certified . . . the
Santa Clara County Planning Com
mission will act on the use permit
modification."
