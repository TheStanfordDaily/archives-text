# Doctors make arthritis advance

A recent discovery by researchers
at Stanford Medical School sheds
light on both the causes and possible
cures of rheumatoid arthritis.
A research team led by Dr.
F.ugene Butcher, assistant professor
of pathology, has discovered that the
disease that afflicts as many as two
million Americans is caused by a
process that may be unique, and
therefore preventable. Any cure re
sulting from this research, however,
is at least several years away,
Butcher said.
Lymphocytes (white blood cells),
which can cause arthritis by enlarg
ing tissue surrounding a person's
joints, were previously thought to
enter joint tissue in the same way
they enter other organs, Butcher
said.
He and his colleagues, however,
have found that this is not the case.
The lymphocytes actually enter the
joints through the use of a homing
receptor discovered by the research
team, he said.
Homing receptors themselves are
not a new discovery. Several years
ago, Butcher, who is also an im
munopathologist at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Medical
Center, and other researchers first
identified two homing receptors
through which lymphocytes
"recognize" molecules called
ligands in the lymph nodes and in
the intestines.
They assumed that the lym

phocytes that cause arthritis were
using one of these two homing
receptors to recognize and bind to
ligands in the joints as well. But by
examining tissue surrounding the
joints of four victims of rheumatoid
arthritis, Butcher's research team
found that the destructive lym
phocytes enter joints through a
newly discovered third homing
receptor.
Because this binding process is
different, it may be preventable
without interfering with the normal
work of lymphocytes, which is to
trigger the body's immune system.
A drug that would prevent this

binding could be a cure for
rheumatoid arthritis, but such a
drug will not be developed for at
least three to five years, Butcher
said.
The drug would be an antibody
capable of preventing lymphocyte
binding in joint tissues, but
"whether that would be clinically
useful is up in the air," according to
Butcher.
He said there are "an awful lot of
technical problems involved in in
jecting antibodies into people" be

immunity to antibodies, thus ren
dering them ineffective.
But a drug that could bind to the
lymphocyte in place of the ligand
might be more similar to aspirin in
its effects on the body, Butcher said.

Researchers will not attempt to
develop such a drug if they find that
the recently discovered homing
receptor is also responsible for
leading lymphocytes to ligands at
other sites of inflammation in the
body, most notably the skin.
A drug that could prevent lym
phocytes from binding to ligands in
the skin would prevent them from
triggering the body's immune system

in response to infections there.
It is unclear why lymphocytes
cause arthritis in joint tissues,
Butcher said. The chances of stop
ping the disease will be greatly in
creased if the new homing receptor
is unique to the joints and is not
used in other regions of the body, he
said.
Butcher said he is optimistic that
a cure can be found.
