# Grads will replace Keystone with 'clean’ dance club
## 
### LARRY LEE Staff writer 
Get ready to dance, Stanford. The Vortex is
coming.
Sometime in mid-August, this new dance
club will open its doors at the site of the former
Keystone Palo Alto on California Avenue.
The Keystone closed July 20.
Dave Siegel, one of the Vortex' owners,
described the club as "an urban-style, dance
oriented club." It will feature primarily re
corded music with occasional live perfor
mances. The music will be mostly "rock of the
'80s" and some "alternative" music, along
with a modicum of what Siegel called
"standard dance classics."

The concept for the Vortex began back in
1984. Siegel and his partner Terry Gould,
both recent graduates of the Stanford Business
School, identified a "business void" in this
part of the Peninsula. The closest dance
oriented club was in Santa Clara, the next
closest ones were in San Francisco.
"We were disappointed with the entertain
ment scene in the area," Siegel said. Turned
off by what Siegel termed the "T and A" pro
motions practiced by nearby nightclubs, the
two concluded, " There was simply no place to
burn off energy in a clean way."
After months of extensive research to deter
mine what people wanted in a dance club,
Siegel and Gould were ready to make their
move. In January of this year they quit their

high-paying jobs to devote their full efforts to
starting their new club. Finding a building
and obtaining permits was a "difficult process"
which took five months, Siegel said. With
four promising sites to pick from, they chose
Palo Alto because of its central location.
And the Vortex was born.
According to Siegel, the emphasis at the
Vortex will be on "comfort, both physical and
social." The remodeling of the building in
cludes new air conditioning, restrooms, car
pet, paint and lighting. The club will also
feature a good sound system, large dance floor
and full-service bar.
Siegel made clear that the club will
definitely not be a "pick-up joint."
The aura of the Vortex will be one of

"innovative non-commercialism," Siegel said.
There will not be any rock videos or disco light
shows — at least not at the outset. There will
be a laser show, but it will be subdued and
tasteful, Siegel said. The music will be accom
panied by still slides with a different theme
each night. Artwork will round out the decor.
"The Vortex should attract a continuum of
people," Siegel said. "On one end would be
music lifestylers, for whom music is an inte
gral part of their lives. These people may dress
differently. They have a good knowledge of
music.
"On the other end will be mainstream
people, who listen to music on the radio in
their cars. We hope to draw both
sides through a variety of music. We
will not be an exclusively Top 40
club,"he said.
Siegel estimated that the Vortex
will draw people from as far away as
10 or 15 miles, but most of the cus
tomers will be from the immediate
Palo Alto area. He is planning to
limit the use of commercial radio to
promote the club, and he said he
might use non-commercial stations
like KZSU and KFJC.

For right now, most nights will be
limited to customers 21 and over,
but Siegel said that might change.
He said he is considering offering
"alternative music nights" for those
18 and over, or possibly for all ages.
There may also be "college nights"
with a minimum age of 18 to get in
and 21 to drink.
Siegel said he hopes the Stanford
community will take advantage of
the Vortex to a greater extent than it
did the Keystone. "The Vortex best
reflects college radio stations," he
said. He said he hopes for joint pro
motions with KZSU and The Daily.
