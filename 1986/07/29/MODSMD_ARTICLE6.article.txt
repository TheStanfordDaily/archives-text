Eisenhower was consistent, prof, says
*
Both as general and as president, Dwight Eisenhower's leadership
was "remarkably consistent" and probably in keeping with the needs of
his times, according to History Prof. David Kennedy.
"Simply possessing goodwill was far more important to him than ac

"Power and Responsibility: Case Studies in American Leadership,"
which he edited with Prof. Michael Parrish of UC-San Diego.
