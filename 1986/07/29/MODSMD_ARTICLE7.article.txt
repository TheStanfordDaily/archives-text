# Female poverty declines
## Relative to men, women show gains, prof. shows 
### 
The proportion of women among U.S.
adult poor declined between 1979 and 1984
after rising sharply in the 19605, according to
Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs.
This trend is a reversal of the last quarter of
a century during which an increasing
percentage of adult poor were women. In a
recently published study, Fuchs defines the
previous trend of increasing female poverty as
the feminization of poverty.
The principal cause of this feminization of
poverty was the increase in female-headed
households, Fuchs said, adding that this is
also a major reason why the trend was more
severe for blacks than for whites.
The feminization of poverty "was not the
result of worsening labor market conditions for
women in comparison with men," Fuch em
phasized.
But the economic success for women in the
first part of this decade has not come without a
price, Fuchs said.
The bottom line is that it's a dilemma

women face between career and marriage,"
Fuchs told the San Jose Mercury News.
"Women have been making considerable
progress in the labor market, but they give up
home and family," he told the Mercury News.
The recent improvement seen by women
results from the fact that women's money
income has been rising much more rapidly
than men's," Fuchs said.
This employment trend continued in 1979-
84, when there was also a substantial increase
in the ratio of hourly earnings of women
compared to men, he said.
"Overall, the trends in poverty rates by type
of household were not better for men than for
women, and between 1979 and 1984 they
were distinctly worse," Fuchs said.
"This was the result of relatively favorable
labor market developments for women â€” a
sharp rise in the ratio of hourly earnings for
women compared to men and a smaller in
crease in unemployment for women than for
men," he added.
