# UPDATE
## Challenger 7 survived blast 
### 
WASHINGTON — The seven crew members of
the space shuttle Challenger probably remained con
scious for at least 10 seconds after the disastrous Jan.
28 explosion and the astronauts switched on at least
three emergency breathing packs, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said yester
day.
At a news conference, NASA officials for the first
time made public information showing that the
Challenger crew probably not only lived through the
initial blast but understood the seriousness of the sit
uation enough to activate the emergency air systems.
The release of information learned from the crew
cabin salvage operation, in addition to a transcript of
crew compartment conversation, contradicted an
earlier July 17 space agency announcement that the
crew probably had no knowledge of their fate.
In a prepared statement, the agency said yesterday
that a subsequent full analysis of tape recordings in
the crew compartment showed "the first potential in
dication of awareness."
"Uh oh," Challenger pilot Michael Smith said 73
seconds after takeoff. It was the last sound of the crew
recorded by the intercom in the shuttle's cabin. The
intercom, as well as the air-to-ground communica
tions, shut off at the time of the explosion.
The explosion occurred when hot gases from the
Challenger's right solid booster burned through a
seam in the multi-sectioned rocket, sending a jet of
heat toward the shuttle's huge fuel tank.
'it's my guess that, at that point, there was aware
ness on the part at least of the commander and pilot
because that was the moment of the explosion," said
Rear Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's associate admin
istrator for space flight.
Restored tapes indicated conversation only among
the four astronauts who sat on the flight deck: Francis
"Dick" Scobee, commander; Michael Smith, pilot;
and Ellison Onizuka and Judith Resnik, both mis
sion specialists.
Unlike the flight deck, which had a voice-activated

intercom system, the mid-deck system required crew
members to push a button to be recorded. Crew
members Christa McAuliffe, Ronald McNair and
Gregory Jarvis, who sat on the mid-deck, followed
NASA procedure and did not record themselves, offi
cials said. However, they were able to hear the con
versation of others.
Dr. Joseph Kerwin, director of life sciences at
NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the
explosion that tore the crew compartment from the
rest of the orbiter probably would not have killed or
even seriously injured the astronauts.
"Medical analysis indicates that these accelerations
are survivable and that the probability of major injury
to crew members is low," Kerwin wrote in a report to
Truly.
In his report, Kerwin said the crew "possibly but
not certainly" lost consciousness in the seconds after
the orbiter began breaking apart because of loss of
pressure in the crew cabin. He said the amount of
time which the crew maintained consciousness
"depends on the rate at which the crew module lost
pressure, and that depends on the size of the hole in
the crew module," which could not be ascertained
from the wreckage.
The explosion occurred at an altitude of 48,000
feet, and the crew cabin continued to a peak of
65,000 feet, Kerwin said.
"The pressures there are so low that even with a
supplemental breathing supply, the time of useful
consciousness would vary between approximately 6
and 15 seconds," Kerwin said at the news confer
ence. "So the number of seconds that the crew may
have retained consciousness would be a function of
how rapidly the crew module lost pressure."
When asked after the news conference if he meant
that the crew probably remained conscious for at least
10 seconds, Kerwin replied: "Yes."
He noted at the press conference that he could not
rule out the possibility that they may have been alive
until the crew cabin hit the water.
