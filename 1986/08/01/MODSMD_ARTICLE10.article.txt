# U.S. kills U.N. resolution
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS - The
United States yesterday vetoed a
Security Council resolution call
ing for it to comply with a World
Court order to stop aiding
Nicaraguan rebels.
The vote was 11-1 for the
resolution, with Thailand, Britain
and France abstaining. The
negative vote of the United States,
one of five permanent members of
the council, killed the measure.
U.S. Ambassador Vernon Wal
ters said the resolution "painted an
inaccurate picture of the true sit
uation in Central America"and
would not have contributed to
peace in the area.
Walters said the court decision
included "baseless assertions"
against the United States and
ignored "very substantial evidence
of Nicaraguan misbehavior."
Sir John Thompson of Britain
abstained, saying the resolution
gave the impression that the

Central American problem was
between Nicaragua and the
United States and did not deal
with Nicaragua's failure to live up
to regional commitments.
"Freedom is being suppressed"
in Nicaragua, Thompson said,
citing the expulsion of Roman
Catholic churchmen and the
closing of a leading newspaper.
The resolution, introduced by
non-aligned members of the 15-
nation council, did not mention
the United States by name, but it
called for full compliance with the
World Court's June 27 ruling
against the United States in a case
brought by Nicaragua.
In that ruling, the court said
U.S. support for Nicaraguan
rebels was illegal and the United
States should pay reparations.
The court is the judicial arm of
the United Nations.
The United States has said it
does not recognize the court's

jurisdiction in the case.
The resolution called on all
countries "to refrain from carrying
out, supporting or promoting poli
tical, economic or military actions
of any kind against any state of the
region."
It also stressed "the obligation of
all states to seek a solution to their
disputes by peaceful means in ac
cordance with international law."
Soviet bloc and non-aligned
countries lined up behind the
resolution in debate earlier yester
day while Walters said in reply
that he resented being lectured by
"paragons" of human rights such
as spokesmen for Libya and Af
ghanistan.
On Tuesday, Nicaraguan Presi
dent Daniel Ortega opened coun
cil debate on the resolution and
said the Reagan Administration
was leading the United States into
another Vietnam in Central
America.
