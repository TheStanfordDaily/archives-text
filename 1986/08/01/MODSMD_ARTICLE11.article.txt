# State spaceport shut

WASHINGTON - The U.S.
Air Force outlined a program yester
day to overcome the loss of the space
shuttle Challenger by emphasizing
the use of unmanned rockets to
boost satellites into space.
"The Expendable Launch
Vehicles (rockets) are going to be the
workhorse from now on" for the
Defense Department, said Air Force
Secretary Edward Aldridge. "We
cannot afford to rely on a single
launch system."
Aldridge also said the Air Force
will delay activating its $3 billion
shuttle spaceport at Vandenberg Air
Force Base in California until 1992,
saving an estimated $1 billion over
five years. The United States even
tually will need the facility to place
shuttles in polar orbit, however, and
thus Vandenberg's activation is
merely a matter of time, he said.
Aldridge said the White House
had approved the Air Force's
recovery plan, including the moth
balling of Vandenberg, and that
future Pentagon budget submissions

to Congress would include the ne
cessary budget requests.
Many of the points highlighted by
Aldridge yesterday had been previ
ously disclosed. For example,
Congress has already authorized the
purchase of additional Titan 4 rock
ets, which are being designed to lift
the same size payloads into orbit as
the shuttle.
Launch pads at both Cape
Canaveral, Fla., and Vandenberg
will have to be modified to handle
the new Titan 4, he said.
The earliest a replacement for
Challenger could be available is
probably 1992, he said, and thus the
new shuttle pad at Vandenberg will
be placed in caretaker status.
Placing sole reliance on the
shuttle was "a major mistake for this
country and we're paying the price
now," he said.
As part of the five-year program,
which Aldridge estimated would
cost $2.6 billion, the Air Force will
buy at least 13 more giant Titan 4
rockets already under development.
