Japan to halt chip dumping
WASHINGTON — Japan has agreed to stop sel
ling computer chips at bargain basement prices in the
United States and to grant U.S. semiconductor
manufacturers a larger share of their own market, the
Reagan Administration said yesterday.
The five-year accord, in one of the stickiest of all
trade disputes between the two nations, could in
crease sales of import-besieged U.S. semiconductor
manufacturers by $2 billion, U.S. Trade Representa
tive Clayton Yeutter said at a news briefing.
In exchange for the Japanese concessions, the
United States agreed to dismiss a series of unfair
trading complaints accusing Japan of "dumping" the
electronic devices in this country at prices below
what it costs to make them.
Officials said the agreement, following months of
negotiations and several missed U.S.-imposed
deadlines, came one minute before midnight Wed
nesday, just as the Commerce Department was pre
paring to go ahead with hefty penalty duties on the
Japanese products.
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the
United States would resurrect those cases should it
detect new evidence of Japanese dumping.
Steelworkers walk off jobs
PITTSBURGH — The first work stoppage in 27
years by steelworkers at USX Corp. began as a con
tract expired at midnight yesterday, with the union
calling the action a lockout and the company saying
the 42,000 workers are on strike.

The labor dispute was prompted by the company's
refusal to continue bargaining under the old con
tract. The United Steelworkers had offered to con
tinue working under the old contract, but USX said
work could continue only under the terms of the
company's last offer.
Negotiators for both sides reportedly met late yes
terday afternoon, but failed to reach agreement. Top
union negotiators were meeting with local union
presidents at 8 p.m. PDT to update them on negotia
tions and advise them on picketing.
Company spokesman Michael Koff said the steel
workers had terminated the labor agreement and had
authorized a strike, so the company, which until
recently was known as U.S. Steel Corp., ordered a
shutdown.
Superfund to return strong
WASHINGTON — House and Senate
negotiators agreed last night to an $8.5 billion
Superfund bill to revive, strengthen and expand
the nation's cash-starved, stalled battle against toxic
chemical waste dumps.
The compromise package, produced after five
months of grueling talks, was hailed by environmen
tal groups, but its adoption by the conferees still left
the toxic cleanup effort far short of being able to
return to full steam.
A separate set of negotiations by tax writers still
must settle a final and difficult question: who will pay
for a beefed-up Superfund — taxpayers, petro
chemical interests, all large corporations or a combi
nation of them.
