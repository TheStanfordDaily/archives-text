South African police begin lifting bans
JOHANNESBURG — Regional police commanders have begun
lifting bans on meetings and public gatherings that some courts
declared they did not have the right to impose under the state of emer
gency.
Anti-apartheid groups said yesterday they will continue their chal
lenges in provincial courts.
Several students in the black high schools of Soweto, which are
patrolled by soldiers, said they had been attacked by dogs. Under the
nationwide state of emergency imposed June 12, the details and cir
cumstances of such events cannot be reported.
Thousands of youngsters have boycotted schools this week in the
huge black township outside Johannesburg to protest the military pres
ence. The activities of security forces cannot be reported without offi
cial permission.
Panel says Marcos faked Aquino trial
MANILA — A special Philippine Supreme Court commission said
yesterday that former President Ferdinand Marcos personally
"scripted" and "stage-managed" last year's acquittal of the 25 military
personnel charged with assassinating the husband of President
Corazon Aquino in 1983. The three-member commission recom
mended that a mistrial be declared.
The commission's 62-page report, which must still be acted upon
formally by the nation's 10-member Supreme Court, was based on 19
days of hearings, the testimony of seven key witnesses and 340 docu
ments.
The commission concluded that the evidence "showed clearly" that
Marcos was personally responsible for "suppression of vital evidence,"
"harassment of witnesses, " "coaching of defense counsels" and "even
the very decision rendered in the case."
The commission's ruling was viewed by many legal experts here as
the first step toward implicating Marcos in the assassination of former
Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr.
