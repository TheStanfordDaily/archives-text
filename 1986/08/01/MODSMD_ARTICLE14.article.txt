## The

In this age of scientific rationality and humanism, it is difficult to
accept the radical fundamentalism of the "Scopes II" trial in Tennes
see. In an ironic reversal of the Darrow-Bryan "monkey trial" of 1925,
in which the state of Tennessee convicted schoolteacher John Scopes
for discussing the theory of evolution in his classroom, a group of fun
damentalist parents led by Vicki Frost wants to force schools to offer
alternative textbooks that base their teachings on fundamentalist
Christian ideology.
Frost centers her argument around the Holt, Rinehart and Winston
textbooks, which contain excerpts of seemingly innocuous children's
books. She condemns as "un-Christian and un-American" the
"witchcraft" in"The Wizard of Oz" and "Jack and Jill" and the
"breaking and entering" in "Goldilocks and the Three Bears."
But to dismiss the case by censuring Frost for her religious beliefs
would be as short-sighted as it was to convict Scopes for teaching any
thing other than creationism.
Obviously, the public school system cannot cater to the whims of
every religious group in this country. If the federal court now handling
the Tennessee trial were to demand that schools offer textbooks along
the criteria of Frost's group, public education would soon be under at
tack from all sides. Countless religious groups in this country would in
turn demand that their children be allowed to study only those books
their respective religions consider "acceptable."
The court must explain to Frost, and to U.S. citizens in general,
that the public school system is obligated to guarantee its students the
same freedoms that allow Frost to take her case before the federal
courts. Freedom of choice is an inalienable right to which all U.S.
citizens are entitled — even the children.
Public schools have a responsibility to offer to each and every child
a comparable education. This means providing not only equal
facilities and access to information, but also equal exposure to the
ideas, ideologies and values of other countries and cultures.
If parents object to the "secular humanism" currently taught in
schools, then they have the option to instruct their own children at
home according to their personal values. But in the end, the children
must be allowed to choose. That choice cannot be made unless stu
dents are exposed to the alternatives.
After the court has explained the purpose of the public school sys
tem to Frost, and after it has made it clear that the U.S. must continue
to separate religion from general education, perhaps Frost will choose
her alternative — a private, Christian school.
