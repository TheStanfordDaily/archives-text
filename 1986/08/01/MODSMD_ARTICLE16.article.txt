The article "Farm hotel irks
neighbors" (July 25) is typical Daily
journalism. It often seems that your
newspaper is the enemy of the Uni
versity. A reasonable article would
have explained the University's need
for a hotel-conference center, and
then listed objections. Instead, the
article was almost entirely negative.
The knee-jerk reaction of many
Stanfordites is to object to any pro
posal from the University.
I have been promoting, planning
and fighting urban sprawl for half a
century, and I have been highly cri

tical of the University's administra
tion. However, the terrible no-men
have prevented several highly
desirable developments, and the
proposed center is badly needed by
the University. Let me stress that I
have no personal interest in it, but,
properly planned, it could actually
grace the environment. Adequate
planning could solve traffic prob
lems. If Stanford is to remain a
leading university, the proposed
center is a must.
Frankly, I don't care what the
people of Menlo Park think. They
have no responsibility for, and in
most cases, no serious interest in the
University, except as a source of rev

enue. We are suffering the conse
quences of a mistake made many
years ago when the University
allowed itself to be put partly under
the jurisdiction of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park. The University should
secede and become a community in
its own right. Unfortunately, this is
now legally not very easy.
But back to my original com
plaint: I wish The Daily would show
some vision about the future of the
University and present a fair picture
of development plans.
