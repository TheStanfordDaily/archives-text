# The 						wonder of advertisements
## 
### 
"Irresistible Force," reads the advertisement from the
Army National Guard, capturing your attention as part
of a two-page, action photo spread in a magazine. T wo
soldiers are in the foreground, one older and confident
looking with his machine gun poised at his hip as he
stands in a river. The other is looking off into the dis
tance, also with his weapon pointed straight ahead, yet
his face gives you a cold, serious and frightened look.

"Kiss your momma goodbye," continues the ad
vertisement. Yeah, kiss your momma — and a lot of
other people — goodbye. If you want to give up hoinc
cookcd spaghetti and meatballs and tin roof sundae ice
cream — all in unlimited quantities — to run around in
the rivers of Alabama while playing with deadly weap
ons, that's all right with me. I'd rather risk life and limb
riding my bicycle to class on a Monday morning at 10
a.m. in front of the Clock Tower, thank you.
Enraptured by the force of the ad, you can't stop
reading on. "No, this isn't some far-off jungle. It's your
own state." Wow, this jungle sure does look like my
state. Let's see, I can't decide if it looks more like the
Santa Ana or San Bernardino freeways at 5 p.m. on
Friday.
"But these are your buddies. The guns are real. And
so is the adventure." Yeah, sure, I would love to have
these guys as my buddies. I bet they can carry on a
stimulating conversation over an Italian dinner.
Besides, they dress in really neat outfits, and they have
such fun toys. I wish I could have all of their toys. I'm
sorry, but my parents just couldn't afford to give me
such nice Christmas presents. I had to play with Hot
Wheels.
T he ad ends with, "True, duty in the Guard won't be
the easiest way to spend a Saturday afternoon. But it will
make your momma proud she raised a man." Are they
telling me that I am not a man? I've never felt so threat
ened since I read Freud in Western Culture. If it means
that much, I'll go out on a Saturday afternoon and
become a man. I think I like my gender just the way it is

— only part of the way male, I guess.
Messages like this ad are everywhere, not just in the
column of some cynic's attempt at humor. The people
in the photos and the words in the text of these and
many other ads tell us how to behave when others don't
tell us explicitly. They seem to make ambiguities
clearer. They make the world black and white, not gray.
Unfortunately, they also do a little bit more.
Most people, especially impressionable young males
who happen to read this particular magazine, do not see
that this spread is really an attempt at humor by the
Army National Guard. Most males actually view this as
a declaration of the prerequisites for being a real man.
We look at these two young guys in the photo and wor
ship them. They are great people, you see. They wander
through jungles in your state, just in case they are ever
needed in a military emergency, such as another
Mexican-American War. They know how to shoot
guns, and how to kill. And, hence, they are men.
Unfortunately, the world is not quite that simple.
There are men out there who are strong, distant and ex
tremely tough who are not in the Army National Guard
or even in the Navy National Guard, if there is such a
thing. There are even men who are not strong, distant
and tough but are very masculine. Or, I know men who
are not even "masculine," but arc perfect human
beings.
Women feel this pressure to conform to society's
dictates as well, and it is just as strong, if not stronger,
for them. They see men wearing T-shirts with "N.F.C.
— No Fat Chicks" written all over them. Men may
think it is sort of funny, but women do not laugh too
hard. They take this "joke" and generalize it to a much
larger level than many would expect; they run until they
drop, eat barely anything for dinner and basically worry
too much about being accepted by their male counter
parts, who will probably laugh at them anyway.
Maybe I'm reading too much into this advertisement.
After all, it is just a sales pitch, and an effective one at
that. One ad shouldn't make that much difference in
the way people feel about themselves and about others.
However, turn the page of the magazine and you will
see something interesting.
Next comes an advertisement containing a picture of
a young, thin, model-pretty woman with a large section
of text next to the photo. Part of it says, "A great way to
hold onto a beautiful body is to make sure it doesn't miss
out on a lot. Like the natural dairy calcium in yogurt."
Maybe two ads are better than one.
