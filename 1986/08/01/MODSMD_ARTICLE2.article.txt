The Stanford University Network (SUNet) cable tele
vision system will expand to its full 30-channel capabil
ity by the end of this month, broadcasting directly to
many classrooms and every on-campus student
residence, according to officials at the Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network (SITN).
Lured by the prospect of a student-run channel on the
expanded cable network, a group of students has drafted
a charter for a proposed student station that is tentatively
scheduled to begin broadcasting fall quarter, said Carey
White, a member of the ASSU Council of Presidents.
No commercial broadcasts will be available on the ex
panded system, but signals from outside Stanford will be
received and broadcast throughout the University, ac
cording to Mary Lou Allen, the director of SITN.
Eight of the channels will carry satellite broadcasts,
ranging from daily Soviet and French programming for

foreign language classes to C-SPAN for political science
classes, she said. The remainder of the channels will be
divided between programs produced by students and fac
ulty and conventional lecture broadcasts, she added.
"Our (SITN's) main mission is to broadcast Stanford
graduate engineering courses to industry," Allen said.
"Originally, the system was conceived for computer in
teractivity; video is a valuable side benefit."
With the acquisition of a full video head-end — a
device that allows SITN to include programs in the
cable network — SITN will be able to broadcast pro
grams to specific classrooms, said Anne Benker, assis
tant to the director of SITN.
"For instance, we could broadcast a program to one
classroom and withhold it from another," she added.
Negotiations are being conducted with Cable Com
munications Cooperative of Palo Alto, a local commer
cial cable company, to add regular network program-
