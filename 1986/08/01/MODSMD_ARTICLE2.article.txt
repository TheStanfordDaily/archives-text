# Stanford expands cable TV

### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
The Stanford University Network (SUNet) cable tele
vision system will expand to its full 30-channel capabil
ity by the end of this month, broadcasting directly to
many classrooms and every on-campus student
residence, according to officials at the Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network (SITN).
Lured by the prospect of a student-run channel on the
expanded cable network, a group of students has drafted
a charter for a proposed student station that is tentatively
scheduled to begin broadcasting fall quarter, said Carey
White, a member of the ASSU Council of Presidents.
No commercial broadcasts will be available on the ex
panded system, but signals from outside Stanford will be
received and broadcast throughout the University, ac
cording to Mary Lou Allen, the director of SITN.
Eight of the channels will carry satellite broadcasts,
ranging from daily Soviet and French programming for

foreign language classes to C-SPAN for political science
classes, she said. The remainder of the channels will be
divided between programs produced by students and fac
ulty and conventional lecture broadcasts, she added.
"Our (SITN's) main mission is to broadcast Stanford
graduate engineering courses to industry," Allen said.
"Originally, the system was conceived for computer in
teractivity; video is a valuable side benefit."
With the acquisition of a full video head-end — a
device that allows SITN to include programs in the
cable network — SITN will be able to broadcast pro
grams to specific classrooms, said Anne Benker, assis
tant to the director of SITN.
"For instance, we could broadcast a program to one
classroom and withhold it from another," she added.
Negotiations are being conducted with Cable Com
munications Cooperative of Palo Alto, a local commer
cial cable company, to add regular network program-
ming to SUNet coverage, Benker
said.
Currently only dorm common
rooms will have cable access, she
continued. Individual dorm rooms
will have cable connections within
three to five years, primarily to link
dorm room microcomputers to the
main University network, Benker
explained.
One of the new channels will be
"totally given over to student pro
gramming," according to White.
"I've just gotten their (the student
run channel's) charter and it's one of
the best documents I've ever seen in
terms of student involvement."
"I think they'd show the Industrial
Engineering 133 class, which tends
to be popular, several times a day, as
well as (ASSU) Speakers Bureau
videotapes," White said.
A student station would be over
seen by a board of officers comprised
of the station's management, ac
cording to the charter. In addition,
an advisory board, which would in
clude representatives from SITN,
Residential Education, the Depart
ment of Communication and the as
sociate dean of Student Affairs,
would be appointed by the dean of
Student Affairs to give "advice and
assistance on the SUNet Student
Channel budget and on matters of
station policy."
The charter will be submitted to
SITN and the station could be on

the air sometime during fall quarter,
White said. If approved, the charter
would be presented to the student
body for approval in the May 1987
ASSU general elections, he added.
Because SUNet is part of the
School of Engineering, Allen said,
supervision of the non-engineering
channels will have to come from
outside the engineering school. To
this end, William Kays, chair of the
University Committee on Academic
Computing and Information Sys
tems, is organizing a faculty com
mittee to look into the issue of
governance, she added.
Participants in SITN's video pro
gram last spring seem to be more
wary of the coming season, accord
ing to John Reuling, a staff program
mer in the Computer Science
Department who has been active in
putting shows spon c ored by the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) on SUNet.
Reuling said the attitude of GLAS
this year "is wait and see." He said
he learned about the SUNet pro
gram through his job last year and
suggested the idea of presenting
GLAS shows through the system at a
GLAS meeting.
GLAS eventually broadcast three
Sunday night interview-style pro
grams before funding considerations
took them off the air, said Reuling.
Even so, he added, "they (SITN) let
us in really cheap; we just had to pay
for the technicians and the lab
time."
The quality of the broadcasts was
good, he said.
