The Eurythmics
"Revenge"
if 1 /.2
I knew I was setting myself up for
a major disappointment when I
agreed to review the latest Euryth
mics album entitled "Revenge." At
one time the band was among my
favorites. It stood as a paradigm of
what a good synthesizer could be
when strong vocals, good rhythm
and lyrical imagery are well mixed
with modern noises. Yet, since last
year's LP farce, "Be Your Self
lonight," the band has seemed to
digress, heading straight for that
dreaded basket of once-sweet, musi
cal grapes now gone sour.
Why the hard rock, high-treble
guitar that is always a sign of
band's efforts to sell to the un
seasoned palates of young American
rockers? Why the cheesy (almost
Muzak-like) orchestra used to poorly
support the band on several of the
album's feeble tracks, such as the
current pop hit "Missionary Man"?
And the Whys? continue to the
point where I want to cry.
The case is truly a sad one consid
ering the remarkable vocal talent of
lead singer Annie Lennox. I would
still highly recommend the band in
concert to witness Lennox' mys

tique and to hear classic songs like
"Sweet Dreams" (1983) and "Who's
That Girl?" (1984). These songs
bring back that cool, eerie breeze
that makes me such a fan of early
Eurythmics music. Unfortunately,
it appears that we will no longer
encounter such treats on vinyl; the

Demon of American Pop Music has
stolen another soul — darn!
Peter Case
"Peter Case"
★★★V2
Peter Case is the former lead
singer and songwriter for The Plim

souls — you might have heard of
their semi-hit single, "A Million
Miles Away." This album, Cases
first solo album, fits very well in a
collection that includes Tom Petty,
John Cougar Mellencamp and so
on. He even has musical help from
Mike Campbell, the Heartbreakers'

lead guitarist, and Jim Keltner, a
drummer who has worked not only
with Petty, but also with Bob Dylan,
Jackson Browne, Mitchell Groom,
John Hiatt and a few other guitar
based rock musicians.
So what you get, once again, is a
rock 'n' roll album — and why not?
This here is good, solid stuff. The

album is flavored by Case's acoustic
guitar and, unlike most of this type
of music, its percussion rhythms
complement as well. The first two
songs in particular, "Echo Wars"
and "Steel Strings," have a Third
World drum rhythm that gives the
whole album a distinct sound.
Overlaying this, however, is very
folk-style rock 'n' roll. At times, his
voice brings on the huskiness of
John Cougar with a slightly more
refined tone. Hell, all that means is
he's a Dylan who hits all the notes
he tries for. Lyrically, Case walks
the border between inflated literary
pomposity and gritty realism. Musi
cally, he coordinates at times a
bluesy sound; on other songs, he has
a folksy rhythm that lets you tap
your feet and smile for a while.
Overall, the album is a pretty suc
cessful move from the garage to the
studio.
Van Morrison
"No Guru, No Method, No
Teacher"
★★★★
Van Morrison's latest concert at
the Greek Theatre in Berkeley made
it clear that Morrison has not strayed
from the blues roots that brought us
such classics as "Moondance,"

"Domino" and "Brown-Eyed Girl."
But if you pick up his latest album,
don't be expecting the rock 'n' roll
pace and styling of that older music.
His last few albums, this included,
have been quiet, personal glimpses
into his life and philosophy. While
his voice still carries its distinctive
edge and soulful power, the music
has become softer, less gritty and
more brooding. That is not a cut on
the album, however. Each song is
crafted to become a poem. Each is
infused with themes of love, spirit
and God. Songs like "No Guru, No
Method, No Teacher," "Just You
and I and Nature," "And the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost"
and"In the Garden Wet With
Rain" he sings with the same lilting
quality.
Morrison has created a beauty to
his blues. He has never been a com
mercial artist. Always something of
a visionary, he continues to refuse to
compromise his distinctive style for
a more potentially commercial
product. Instead, this album treats
the listener to "One Irish Rover's"
glimpse of the world. And it looks
just great.

pomposity and gritty realism. Musi
cally, he coordinates at times a
bluesy sound; on other songs, he has
a folksy rhythm that lets you tap
your feet and smile for a while.
Overall, the album is a pretty suc
cessful move from the garage to the
studio.
Van Morrison
"No Guru, No Method, No
Teacher"
★★★★
Van Morrison's latest concert at
the Greek Theatre in Berkeley made
it clear that Morrison has not strayed
from the blues roots that brought us
such classics as "Moondance,"

"Domino" and "Brown-Eyed Girl."
But if you pick up his latest album,
don't be expecting the rock 'n' roll
pace and styling of that older music.
His last few albums, this included,
have been quiet, personal glimpses
into his life and philosophy. While
his voice still carries its distinctive
edge and soulful power, the music
has become softer, less gritty and
more brooding. That is not a cut on
the album, however. Each song is
crafted to become a poem. Each is
infused with themes of love, spirit
and God. Songs like "No Guru, No
Method, No Teacher," "Just You
and I and Nature," "And the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost"
and"In the Garden Wet With
Rain" he sings with the same lilting
quality.
Morrison has created a beauty to
his blues. He has never been a com
mercial artist. Always something of
a visionary, he continues to refuse to
compromise his distinctive style for
a more potentially commercial
product. Instead, this album treats
the listener to "One Irish Rover's"
glimpse of the world. And it looks
just great.

The Eurythmics
"Revenge"
if 1 /.2
I knew I was setting myself up for
a major disappointment when I
agreed to review the latest Euryth
mics album entitled "Revenge." At
one time the band was among my
favorites. It stood as a paradigm of
what a good synthesizer could be
when strong vocals, good rhythm
and lyrical imagery are well mixed
with modern noises. Yet, since last
year's LP farce, "Be Your Self
lonight," the band has seemed to
digress, heading straight for that
dreaded basket of once-sweet, musi
cal grapes now gone sour.
Why the hard rock, high-treble
guitar that is always a sign of
band's efforts to sell to the un
seasoned palates of young American
rockers? Why the cheesy (almost
Muzak-like) orchestra used to poorly
support the band on several of the
album's feeble tracks, such as the
current pop hit "Missionary Man"?
And the Whys? continue to the
point where I want to cry.
The case is truly a sad one consid
ering the remarkable vocal talent of
lead singer Annie Lennox. I would
still highly recommend the band in
concert to witness Lennox' mys

tique and to hear classic songs like
"Sweet Dreams" (1983) and "Who's
That Girl?" (1984). These songs
bring back that cool, eerie breeze
that makes me such a fan of early
Eurythmics music. Unfortunately,
it appears that we will no longer
encounter such treats on vinyl; the

Demon of American Pop Music has
stolen another soul — darn!
Peter Case
"Peter Case"
★★★V2
Peter Case is the former lead
singer and songwriter for The Plim

souls — you might have heard of
their semi-hit single, "A Million
Miles Away." This album, Cases
first solo album, fits very well in a
collection that includes Tom Petty,
John Cougar Mellencamp and so
on. He even has musical help from
Mike Campbell, the Heartbreakers'

lead guitarist, and Jim Keltner, a
drummer who has worked not only
with Petty, but also with Bob Dylan,
Jackson Browne, Mitchell Groom,
John Hiatt and a few other guitar
based rock musicians.
So what you get, once again, is a
rock 'n' roll album — and why not?
This here is good, solid stuff. The

album is flavored by Case's acoustic
guitar and, unlike most of this type
of music, its percussion rhythms
complement as well. The first two
songs in particular, "Echo Wars"
and "Steel Strings," have a Third
World drum rhythm that gives the
whole album a distinct sound.
Overlaying this, however, is very
folk-style rock 'n' roll. At times, his
voice brings on the huskiness of
John Cougar with a slightly more
refined tone. Hell, all that means is
he's a Dylan who hits all the notes
he tries for. Lyrically, Case walks
the border between inflated literary
pomposity and gritty realism. Musi
cally, he coordinates at times a
bluesy sound; on other songs, he has
a folksy rhythm that lets you tap
your feet and smile for a while.
Overall, the album is a pretty suc
cessful move from the garage to the
studio.
