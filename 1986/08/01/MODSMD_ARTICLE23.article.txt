# Musical: no cat's pajamas

Well, we finally got it. Yes, "Cats" has hit San
Francisco in all of its feline magnitude. Financially
and artistically this is one of the biggest musicals
ever, and no doubt the public relations people have
been shoving this fact down your throat in your local
media. If you go to this show expecting to have a reli
gious experience in the manner the advertisers would
have you believe, you will be sadly disappointed. I
have yet to meet anyone who thinks the "Now and
Forever" show is really all it's cracked up to be.

It is the "Star Wars" of
musical theater.

Then again, it's cracked up to he the end-all and
be-all of musical theater. This is a pretty tough name
to live up to, and anyone who expects it to do so
deserves the disappointment they'll feel at the final
curtain. "Cats" is a good show and a fun time, but it
would be more so without all the hype.
If you are among the very few who have never
heard of the Andrew Lloyd-Wcbcr musical based on
T.S. Eliot's "Old Possum's Book of Cats," then a
quick summary is in order. The show is a pop-rock
musical that relics little on plot and a lot on visual ex
travagance to mesmerize the audience. It focuses on
the annual meeting of the Jeclicle cats — a select

type of feline. There is a plotline about who will be
chosen from all the Jeelicle cats to be reborn with a
new life, but while we are waiting for this to occur,
we get to meet a number of the cats. The variety runs
the gamut of the imagination: spoiled cats, motherly
cats, mischievous cats, dramatic cats, magical cats
and destitute cats.
1 he strength of the show is clearly the overwhelm
ing visual appeal of the 20-odd dancers dancing in
skintight cat outfits against John Napier's huge back
drop of a garbage dump. There are moving set pieces,
fog machines, hundreds of lights and explosions. It is
the "Star Wars" of musical theater (at least until the
batch of high-tech rock musicals hit London this
year). In any case, it is a stunningly beautiful show to
look at.
Listening is also fun, even though there is only one
memorable tune. There are lots of rollicking tunes to
tap your foot to as well as the usual show-stopping
"hit" — "Memory."
Interestingly, the San Francisco company was
much more engaging and energetic than the London
cast I saw a few years back. This is partially due to an
aptly rewritten song for this production, a complete
re-staging of another long segment, and the simple
fact that the cast has not been dulled by three years of
performance. My personal favorite numbers in
cluded: "Rum Turn rugger" (biggest feline ego
award), "Munglo jerry and Rumpleteezer" (amazing
acrobatics), "Growltiger's Last Stand" (sheer spec
tacle and amateur theatrics) and "Memory" (moving
melancholy).
