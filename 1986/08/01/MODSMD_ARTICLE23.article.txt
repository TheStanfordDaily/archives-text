# Musical: no cat's pajamas
## 
### PETER MORGAN Staff writer 
Well, we finally got it. Yes, "Cats" has hit San
Francisco in all of its feline magnitude. Financially
and artistically this is one of the biggest musicals
ever, and no doubt the public relations people have
been shoving this fact down your throat in your local
media. If you go to this show expecting to have a reli
gious experience in the manner the advertisers would
have you believe, you will be sadly disappointed. I
have yet to meet anyone who thinks the "Now and
Forever" show is really all it's cracked up to be.

It is the "Star Wars" of
musical theater.

Then again, it's cracked up to he the end-all and
be-all of musical theater. This is a pretty tough name
to live up to, and anyone who expects it to do so
deserves the disappointment they'll feel at the final
curtain. "Cats" is a good show and a fun time, but it
would be more so without all the hype.
If you are among the very few who have never
heard of the Andrew Lloyd-Wcbcr musical based on
T.S. Eliot's "Old Possum's Book of Cats," then a
quick summary is in order. The show is a pop-rock
musical that relics little on plot and a lot on visual ex
travagance to mesmerize the audience. It focuses on
the annual meeting of the Jeclicle cats — a select

type of feline. There is a plotline about who will be
chosen from all the Jeelicle cats to be reborn with a
new life, but while we are waiting for this to occur,
we get to meet a number of the cats. The variety runs
the gamut of the imagination: spoiled cats, motherly
cats, mischievous cats, dramatic cats, magical cats
and destitute cats.
1 he strength of the show is clearly the overwhelm
ing visual appeal of the 20-odd dancers dancing in
skintight cat outfits against John Napier's huge back
drop of a garbage dump. There are moving set pieces,
fog machines, hundreds of lights and explosions. It is
the "Star Wars" of musical theater (at least until the
batch of high-tech rock musicals hit London this
year). In any case, it is a stunningly beautiful show to
look at.
Listening is also fun, even though there is only one
memorable tune. There are lots of rollicking tunes to
tap your foot to as well as the usual show-stopping
"hit" — "Memory."
Interestingly, the San Francisco company was
much more engaging and energetic than the London
cast I saw a few years back. This is partially due to an
aptly rewritten song for this production, a complete
re-staging of another long segment, and the simple
fact that the cast has not been dulled by three years of
performance. My personal favorite numbers in
cluded: "Rum Turn rugger" (biggest feline ego
award), "Munglo jerry and Rumpleteezer" (amazing
acrobatics), "Growltiger's Last Stand" (sheer spec
tacle and amateur theatrics) and "Memory" (moving
melancholy).
Then, of course there were lows.
In general, the music intensity
wavered, meaning that the energetic
punch needed in some songs (the
opening — "Skimbleshanks') was
way too low. Also the cast seemed to
be holding back in the first act, as if
they weren't letting go or being
allowed to let go all of their enthusi
asm. Oddly, I found that my favorite
numbers in London turned out to be
my least favorite here, as the

numerous turns of Mr. Mistofolees
(the magical cat) did little to carry a
generally weak number while
"Skimbleshanks," the railroad cat,
seemed flat despite its fast-paced
score.
What else is there to say? "Cats,''
like "Star Wars," has built up a
mythology of its own, and not to
have seen it is to fail Pop Culture
101. Trying to critique any more
wouldn't change one's yearning to
see this production, although I'd
love to know what T.S. Eliot would
have thought. A few quick notes: the
Golden Gate Theater is pros

cenium, not thrust, which means
you won't be "surrounded" by the
show as would be the case in Lon
don (although you can go on stage
during intermission).
Again, it's not what it's cracked up
to be, but it's still a fun time. Unfor
tunately, most of us will have ex
cessively high expectations after
waiting a few months to get tickets at
$30 apiece. If you can keep calm
about seeing "Cats," or at least re
member it's just a musical (a good
musical, but still a musical), then
you will have a worthwhile experi
ence.

101. Trying to critique any more
wouldn't change one's yearning to
see this production, although I'd
love to know what T.S. Eliot would
have thought. A few quick notes: the
Golden Gate Theater is pros

cenium, not thrust, which means
you won't be "surrounded" by the
show as would be the case in Lon
don (although you can go on stage
during intermission).
Again, it's not what it's cracked up
to be, but it's still a fun time. Unfor

waiting a few months to get tickets at
$30 apiece. If you can keep calm
about seeing "Cats," or at least re

musical, but still a musical), then
you will have a worthwhile experi

Well, we finally got it. Yes, "Cats" has hit San
Francisco in all of its feline magnitude. Financially
and artistically this is one of the biggest musicals
ever, and no doubt the public relations people have
been shoving this fact down your throat in your local
media. If you go to this show expecting to have a reli
gious experience in the manner the advertisers would
have you believe, you will be sadly disappointed. I
have yet to meet anyone who thinks the "Now and
Forever" show is really all it's cracked up to be.

It is the "Star Wars" of
musical theater.

Then again, it's cracked up to he the end-all and
be-all of musical theater. This is a pretty tough name
to live up to, and anyone who expects it to do so
deserves the disappointment they'll feel at the final
curtain. "Cats" is a good show and a fun time, but it
would be more so without all the hype.
If you are among the very few who have never
heard of the Andrew Lloyd-Wcbcr musical based on
T.S. Eliot's "Old Possum's Book of Cats," then a
quick summary is in order. The show is a pop-rock
musical that relics little on plot and a lot on visual ex
travagance to mesmerize the audience. It focuses on
the annual meeting of the Jeclicle cats — a select

type of feline. There is a plotline about who will be
chosen from all the Jeelicle cats to be reborn with a
new life, but while we are waiting for this to occur,
we get to meet a number of the cats. The variety runs
the gamut of the imagination: spoiled cats, motherly
cats, mischievous cats, dramatic cats, magical cats
and destitute cats.
1 he strength of the show is clearly the overwhelm
ing visual appeal of the 20-odd dancers dancing in
skintight cat outfits against John Napier's huge back
drop of a garbage dump. There are moving set pieces,
fog machines, hundreds of lights and explosions. It is
the "Star Wars" of musical theater (at least until the
batch of high-tech rock musicals hit London this
year). In any case, it is a stunningly beautiful show to
look at.
Listening is also fun, even though there is only one
memorable tune. There are lots of rollicking tunes to
tap your foot to as well as the usual show-stopping
"hit" — "Memory."
Interestingly, the San Francisco company was
much more engaging and energetic than the London
cast I saw a few years back. This is partially due to an
aptly rewritten song for this production, a complete
re-staging of another long segment, and the simple
fact that the cast has not been dulled by three years of
performance. My personal favorite numbers in
cluded: "Rum Turn rugger" (biggest feline ego
award), "Munglo jerry and Rumpleteezer" (amazing
acrobatics), "Growltiger's Last Stand" (sheer spec
tacle and amateur theatrics) and "Memory" (moving
melancholy).
Then, of course there were lows.
In general, the music intensity
wavered, meaning that the energetic
punch needed in some songs (the
opening — "Skimbleshanks') was
way too low. Also the cast seemed to
be holding back in the first act, as if
they weren't letting go or being
allowed to let go all of their enthusi
asm. Oddly, I found that my favorite
numbers in London turned out to be
my least favorite here, as the

numerous turns of Mr. Mistofolees
(the magical cat) did little to carry a
generally weak number while
"Skimbleshanks," the railroad cat,
seemed flat despite its fast-paced
score.
What else is there to say? "Cats,''
like "Star Wars," has built up a
mythology of its own, and not to
have seen it is to fail Pop Culture
