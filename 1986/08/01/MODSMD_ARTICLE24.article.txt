### BRUCE BROWN CINDY SPIEKERMAN 
Hie Fish Market
3150 El Camino Real, Palo Alto
493-9188
As the San Francisco wharf area
becomes more and more commer
cial, and its famed seafood restau
rants further direct themselves
toward tourists, the Fish Market on
El Camino in Palo Alto continues to
provide the attractive alternative for
fresh fish on the Peninsula.
We went on a Thursday night
and, as if to confirm our appraisal of
the fine quality of this restaurant,
there was a wait for tables. The Fish
Market does not accept reservations,
and it often gets quite crowded
during both the lunch and dinner
hours.
The menu, we decided after sit
ting down and looking over it for
several minutes, has a lot of diversity
to it. There is a healthy choice of ap
petizers, including fresh shellfish,
pastas, smoked fish, chowders and
even sashimi. The entree selections,
meanwhile, list fish from around the
world — from Hawaii to New
Zealand to Alaska. Several fresh
vegetables are available daily, and

there is also a very short but highly
selective wine list sporting rieslings
and chardonnays from California
wine regions.
We decided upon a calamari
(squid) vinaigrette to start things off.
It carne as a shrimp cocktail does —
in a slightly cup-shaped bowl with a
long stem. The strings of squid were
tossed with various greens and cov
ered with a light dressing. With it
came fresh bread and butter, which
is included with all meals. The
calamari, although attractively
served, was unfortunately rather
bland, and the dressing did nothing
to enliven the taste. This is not a
complaint about its freshness or
quality — it seemed to have both.
What was missing was distinction.
When we moved on to the next
course, however, the meal began to
pick up. Both of us ordered the res
taurant's New England-style clam
chowder (the Fish Market also serves
the tomato-based Manhattan chow
der), and it was very good. This soup
has a nice blend of tastes — clams,
potatoes and spices — and the con
sistency is near-perfect — neither
too thick nor too watery. This was,
indeed, a good chowder.
For her main course, Cindy or
dered Tiger Prawns. Our waitress
had assured us that the name was fit
ting, and when they came out on
skewers, we saw for ourselves. The
serving consisted of several
monstrously over-sized prawns,
which were already shelled. Cindy
chose as her side dish au gratin
potatoes. Bruce's entree was
Hawaiian Yellowfin Tuna.
Both the prawns and the tuna

were excellent. The prawns had a
very fleshy texture, and dipped in
butter, had the meaty taste of good
lobster. And as for fresh tuna, it is
always a treat. Tuna in general has
taken on a bad name because more
than often people associate it with
the canned variety, which has nei
ther the taste nor the firmness of the
fish when it is fresh and cut in fillets.
After a meal of this proportion,
one is truly content and probably
not interested in dessert — at least,
this is what the restaurant managers
are counting on. The Fish Market
offers no desserts.
