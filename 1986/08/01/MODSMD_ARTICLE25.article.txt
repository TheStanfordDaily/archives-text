## Triathlete aims to finish course, improve time 
### 
'Win at all cost." The desire to finish ahead of the competi
tion is part of human nature. It is certainly encouraged by soci
ety. Those who are victorious become heroes, idols — even
legends. The runner-up is quickly forgotten. As one athlete
once muttered, "Finishing second is like kissing your sister."
Or, in the now immortal words of Vince Lombardi, "Winning
isn't everything — it's the only thing." The great Pele wrote in
his autobiography about being scared to return to Brazil after
losing in the 1966 World Cup. The Brazilian public would
have nothing to do with a losing team.

The situation in the United States may not be quite so grave,
but the "success ethic" is ingrained in the citizens of this
country. It has made a farce out of college football and basket
ball. Schools so regularly violate recruiting regulations that the
NCAA has a backlog of cases comparable to that of the Su
preme Court. If you must, cheat in order to win.
Some don't cheat. They just ruin their bodies. Steroids.
Drugs. Make yourself stronger than Atlas. Lift more weight
above your head than any man ever has. Then watch your
body fall apart. Strokes. Heart failure.
Those athletes of stronger character escape the grip of the

"Win at all cost" mentality. They are not indifferent toward
competition. In fact, many are fierce competitors. Like most,
they want to win. The difference is that their desire to win is
simply that — a desire. It may be a burning desire, but it is not
a necessity. And their motivation to succeed is not to earn a big
contract or to make the headlines in the sports page, but rather
to prove to themselves that they can accomplish what they have
previously been unable to achieve. They are their own
audiences, critics and — most importantly — biggest support
ers.
To be sure, there are athletes in every sport who fit this des
cription; the money and publicity come not because the person
is a prima donna and is greedy, but are a result of the stature of
the particular sport. Yet there are few sports where this is the
rule, not the exception. One such sport is the triathlon.
Last Sunday, I witnessed a triathlon for the first time. My
brother, who has been training since the beginning of the year,
competed in the San Luis Obispo Recreation Department tri
athlon, his maiden attempt to swim, bike and run in succes
sion. The distances were relatively short by a triathlete's
standards: half-mile swim, 15 miles on the bike and a four-mile
run. Yet the event brought about some memorable and
refreshing images. Two ladies in their 60s pushing one another
to complete the course. A middle-aged man, determined not to
throw in the towel during the swimming part. As he reached
the final few laps in the pool, exhaustion limited him to float
ing on his back. Nevertheless, he finished.
Finishing. Not winning. The dominant credo of the triath
lete. Sure, there are a few for whom winning is the goal. These
are the superhuman athletes. The Scott Tinleys and Dave
Scotts, who run the ironman in nine hours. But for the
majority, visions of gold medals and championship rings never
enter the mind. Instead, there are questions. "Will I make it?"

"Can I push myself any farther?"
For those who know that they can endure, the triathlon
becomes a one-on-one battle — not with other competitors,
but with the clock and the course. A constant striving towards
improvement. Upon finishing the race last weekend, my
brother looked at his time of one hour, 36 minutes and two
seconds and predicted, "Next year, I'll cut it by 10 minutes."
The triathlon is certainly the ultimate sporting challenge.
No matter the distance, it combines three difficult events. The
very rare triathlete is naturally talented in two of the three.
Most need work in at least two, possibly all three. Thus, the
training regiment is unparalleled. For my brother, it includes
cycling to work, swimming after work and running whenever
he can fit it into his schedule.
As well, most triathletes must learn to deal with adversity.
Heat exhaustion. Cramps. Assorted aches and pains. Mental
fatigue. And many of the male participants must accept the fact*
that many of the female triathletes will leave them in the dust.
Sounds funny, but can you imagine a male tennis player ad
mitting that he's not quite as good as his female counterpart.
Not a chance. The ego is too big.
As the triathletes finished the running part in San Luis
Obispo, I saw something that I had not expected. After com
pleting a triathlon, one would certainly be entitled to crash in a
heap on the nearest bed and relax for a few hours. But what oc
curred instead was the cumulative gathering of those who had
already completed the race near the finish line to offer their ap
plause for those who were seconds away from fulfilling their
goal. The goal, of course, was to make it to the end. For, as
somebody somewhere once said, "Finishing second or third or
one-thousandth in a triathlon is like kissing Marilyn Monroe."
Or, in the case of the women triathletes, "like kissing Robert
Redford."

sion. The distances were relatively short by a triathlete's
standards: half-mile swim, 15 miles on the bike and a four-mile
run. Yet the event brought about some memorable and
refreshing images. Two ladies in their 60s pushing one another
to complete the course. A middle-aged man, determined not to
throw in the towel during the swimming part. As he reached
the final few laps in the pool, exhaustion limited him to float
ing on his back. Nevertheless, he finished.
Finishing. Not winning. The dominant credo of the triath
lete. Sure, there are a few for whom winning is the goal. These
are the superhuman athletes. The Scott Tinleys and Dave
Scotts, who run the ironman in nine hours. But for the
majority, visions of gold medals and championship rings never
enter the mind. Instead, there are questions. "Will I make it?"

"Can I push myself any farther?"
For those who know that they can endure, the triathlon
becomes a one-on-one battle — not with other competitors,
but with the clock and the course. A constant striving towards
improvement. Upon finishing the race last weekend, my
brother looked at his time of one hour, 36 minutes and two
seconds and predicted, "Next year, I'll cut it by 10 minutes."
The triathlon is certainly the ultimate sporting challenge.
No matter the distance, it combines three difficult events. The
very rare triathlete is naturally talented in two of the three.
Most need work in at least two, possibly all three. Thus, the
training regiment is unparalleled. For my brother, it includes
cycling to work, swimming after work and running whenever
he can fit it into his schedule.
As well, most triathletes must learn to deal with adversity.
Heat exhaustion. Cramps. Assorted aches and pains. Mental
fatigue. And many of the male participants must accept the fact*
that many of the female triathletes will leave them in the dust.
Sounds funny, but can you imagine a male tennis player ad
mitting that he's not quite as good as his female counterpart.
Not a chance. The ego is too big.
As the triathletes finished the running part in San Luis
Obispo, I saw something that I had not expected. After com
pleting a triathlon, one would certainly be entitled to crash in a
heap on the nearest bed and relax for a few hours. But what oc
curred instead was the cumulative gathering of those who had
already completed the race near the finish line to offer their ap
plause for those who were seconds away from fulfilling their
goal. The goal, of course, was to make it to the end. For, as
somebody somewhere once said, "Finishing second or third or
one-thousandth in a triathlon is like kissing Marilyn Monroe."
Or, in the case of the women triathletes, "like kissing Robert
Redford."

'Win at all cost." The desire to finish ahead of the competi
tion is part of human nature. It is certainly encouraged by soci
ety. Those who are victorious become heroes, idols — even
legends. The runner-up is quickly forgotten. As one athlete
once muttered, "Finishing second is like kissing your sister."
Or, in the now immortal words of Vince Lombardi, "Winning
isn't everything — it's the only thing." The great Pele wrote in
his autobiography about being scared to return to Brazil after
losing in the 1966 World Cup. The Brazilian public would
have nothing to do with a losing team.

The situation in the United States may not be quite so grave,
but the "success ethic" is ingrained in the citizens of this
country. It has made a farce out of college football and basket
ball. Schools so regularly violate recruiting regulations that the
NCAA has a backlog of cases comparable to that of the Su
preme Court. If you must, cheat in order to win.
Some don't cheat. They just ruin their bodies. Steroids.
Drugs. Make yourself stronger than Atlas. Lift more weight
above your head than any man ever has. Then watch your
body fall apart. Strokes. Heart failure.
Those athletes of stronger character escape the grip of the

"Win at all cost" mentality. They are not indifferent toward
competition. In fact, many are fierce competitors. Like most,
they want to win. The difference is that their desire to win is
simply that — a desire. It may be a burning desire, but it is not
a necessity. And their motivation to succeed is not to earn a big
contract or to make the headlines in the sports page, but rather
to prove to themselves that they can accomplish what they have
previously been unable to achieve. They are their own
audiences, critics and — most importantly — biggest support
ers.
To be sure, there are athletes in every sport who fit this des
cription; the money and publicity come not because the person
is a prima donna and is greedy, but are a result of the stature of
the particular sport. Yet there are few sports where this is the
rule, not the exception. One such sport is the triathlon.
Last Sunday, I witnessed a triathlon for the first time. My
brother, who has been training since the beginning of the year,
competed in the San Luis Obispo Recreation Department tri
athlon, his maiden attempt to swim, bike and run in succes
sion. The distances were relatively short by a triathlete's
standards: half-mile swim, 15 miles on the bike and a four-mile
