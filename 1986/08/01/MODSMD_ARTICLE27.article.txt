# Elitism threatening the top universities?
## 
### 
Highly selective admissions
policies here at Stanford and at the
nation's other leading private uni
versities are compounded by the in
creasingly careerist interests of stu
dents, according to Hans Weiler, as
sociate dean of the School of Educa
tion.
As a result, the effectiveness of
these institutions in forming future
elites appears to be increasing, he
said.
But he has a "nagging suspicion"
that the legitimacy of Harvard, Stan
ford and similar institutions could
be challenged if they "become in
creasingly the vehicles through
which a large majority of their stu

dents orchestrate their personal ad
vancement into positions of ex
traordinary material comfort and so
cial success."
His views are based on analysis of
two recent books, "Choosing Elites"
by Robert Klitgaard, a review of ad
missions practices at Harvard, and
"Careerism and Intellectualism
Among College Students" by
Herant Katchadourian and John
Boli of Stanford.
'The prevailing patterns of cul
tural norms and attitudes among
college students tend to strengthen
the impact of a highly selective ad
missions system, and vice versa,"
Weiler said.
