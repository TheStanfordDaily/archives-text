# Research assesses AIDS contagion
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
People who test positive for the
AIDS antibody do not always pass
the virus to their sexual partners, a
recent Stanford Medical Center
study has concluded.
At least one partner in six couples
taking part in the study had tested
positive for the antibody, but only
two people passed the virus to their
partners. Two people who actually
had AIDS did not infect their
partners.
Researchers cautioned, however,
that the study monitored only a
small group of people for a short
time, and the results do not indicate
that it is safe to have sex with an
AIDS-infected partner.
"I definitely do not think that this
study should be used for evidence
that people should not follow safe
sexual practices that have been rec
ommended," said Dr. Barbara
Weiser, a former Stanford professor
of medicine now at the State .Uni
versity of New York at Stony Brook.
"What the data shows is that
indeed [AIDS] can be transmitted
through heterosexual contact," she
said. "The fact that we did not find
evidence of transmission in every
case certainly doesn't mean that it
couldn't occur at a later date."
The study, which was published
in the july issue of the American
Journal of Medicine, "pinned
down'' suspicion that AIDS can be
spread through vaginal as well as
anal intercourse, said Dr. William
Robinson, Stanford professor of in

fectious diseases and a member of
the research team.
As of July 21, acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) had
been diagnosed in 22,815 people in
the United States and had claimed
12,530 lives, according to estimates
of the federal Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta. There is no
known cure for the disease.
The study examined nine Bay
Area couples, both heterosexual and
homosexual, in 1983 and 1984. In
six couples, at least one partner had
tested positive for the antibody, and
in three at least one member was at
high risk â€” he or she was either
homosexual, bisexual, the former
partner of an AIDS victim or had
received blood transfusions for
hemophilia.
The study was designed to find
clues on how acquired immune
deficiency syndrome spreads, but re
searchers found "no clear pattern of
transmission," according to the
journal report.
Both cases of transmission oc
curred in heterosexual couples in
which one partner tested positive for
the antibody, while one man and
one woman infected with the virus
itself did not infect their partners.
Most research on sexual transmis
sion of AIDS has studied people
with multiple partners, but in the
Stanford study two-thirds of the sub
jects had regular monogomous
sexual contact for at least a year,
some for at least two years, Weiser
said.
