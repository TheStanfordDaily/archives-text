A pub and a student union controlled by
students could be in Stanford's future, said
Carey White and Rudy Fuentes, members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents (COP), while
discussing Tresidder Union renovation plans
with students this week.
Although the Tresidder Union Board has
already developed renovation plans of its own,
the COP sponsored the informational
meetings in order to gather student input
before the plans become finalized, White ex
plained.
The Tresidder Union Board could gain
Design and Project Approval from the Univer
sity Board of Trustees as early as this winter,

White said.
We wanted to open the lines of communi
cation," Fuentes added.
Currently, Tresidder management is pursu
ing renovation plans ''we started using in 1982
for the long-run space in Tresidder," said Paul
Szczesiul, assistant director of Tresidder Un
ion. Next fall, the Tresidder Union Board will
establish a project team to look into renovation
of The Store and The Coffee House, accord
ing to Szczesiul.
I m not sure what Carey is envisioning by
meeting with students," Szczesiul said.
Fuentes said students would like increased
control of Tresidder operations. "Students
want an open door," he said.
