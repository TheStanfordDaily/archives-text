# COP eyes Tresidder plans
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
A pub and a student union controlled by
students could be in Stanford's future, said
Carey White and Rudy Fuentes, members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents (COP), while
discussing Tresidder Union renovation plans
with students this week.
Although the Tresidder Union Board has
already developed renovation plans of its own,
the COP sponsored the informational
meetings in order to gather student input
before the plans become finalized, White ex
plained.
The Tresidder Union Board could gain
Design and Project Approval from the Univer
sity Board of Trustees as early as this winter,

White said.
We wanted to open the lines of communi
cation," Fuentes added.
Currently, Tresidder management is pursu
ing renovation plans ''we started using in 1982
for the long-run space in Tresidder," said Paul
Szczesiul, assistant director of Tresidder Un
ion. Next fall, the Tresidder Union Board will
establish a project team to look into renovation
of The Store and The Coffee House, accord
ing to Szczesiul.
I m not sure what Carey is envisioning by
meeting with students," Szczesiul said.
Fuentes said students would like increased
control of Tresidder operations. "Students
want an open door," he said.
According to ASSU Senate Chair
Jeff Soukup, Tresidder was
originally designed to be a student
union and has gradually become a
"community union."
"Students raised 15 percent of
Tresidder's original construction
costs, we now have 6 percent of the
space and none of the control," he
said.
The ASSU would like to convert
Tresidder back into a student union
under student control, he said.
According to Szczesiul, Tresidder
management is, in fact, under stu
dent control. A majority of students
serve on the Tresidder Board, and
COP member Mary Thurber is on
the board, he said.
At the COP informational
meetings, students suggested addi
tions to Tresidder such as a pub, a
McDonald's restaurant, VCR ren
tals and a student-lounge area with
music.
"One really big need is a fun
place to be," White said. Students
have expressed two different visions
of this "fun place," White said.
Some people want a cafe atmos
phere and others, especially
graduate students, would like a pub,
he explained.
White said Tresidder currently
does not include a pub in its renova
tion plans. "We think the new Cof
fee House will be like a cafe, much
more upscale than a pub," he said.
In the meetings, students sugges
ted the Old Firehouse as a possible
site for the pub. "The Old Firehouse
is a unique place . . . and it would
be a lot less expensive to refurnish it

[than to build a new site]," White
said.
Plans for a student pub are only in
the preliminary stages, Fuentes said.
"Our plans for the Old Firehouse
will only go into action after we've
secured office space for the other or
ganizations [now using the Old
Firehouse]," he said. GLAS, Alpha
Phi Omega, the Axe Committee,
the Graduate Students Association
and Tuesday Films are among the
organizations currently using the
Old Firehouse.
GLAS would probably move if a
suitable meeting place could be
found, said Ken Ruebush, a mem
ber of the organization. Citing a
need for wheelchair access,
Ruebush said, "We were thinking of
finding a new location anyway."
Due to access problems, the Lesbian
Rap Group no longer meets in the

building, he said.
Tresidder Asst. Director Nancy
Howe, who controls liquor licensing
services on campus, said that "only
22 percent of students suggested the
need for a pub on campus" in a
recent survey. She added that the
University subsidizes the other
eating services on campus and that it
may not wish to duplicate services
by subsidizing a pub.
The University has already shown
"some acceptance to alcohol,"
Howe said. Encina Station and The
Coffee House serve beer and the
Faculty Club serves hard liquor, she
added.
White said another item of stu
dent concern is that students feel the
second floor of Tresidder is not de
signed for their use. "There is an
eerie feeling that you shouldn't be
there," White said.

for the long-run space in Tresidder," said Paul
Szczesiul, assistant director of Tresidder Un
ion. Next fall, the Tresidder Union Board will
establish a project team to look into renovation
of The Store and The Coffee House, accord
ing to Szczesiul.
I m not sure what Carey is envisioning by
meeting with students," Szczesiul said.
Fuentes said students would like increased
control of Tresidder operations. "Students
want an open door," he said.
According to ASSU Senate Chair
Jeff Soukup, Tresidder was
originally designed to be a student
union and has gradually become a
"community union."
"Students raised 15 percent of
Tresidder's original construction
costs, we now have 6 percent of the
space and none of the control," he
said.
The ASSU would like to convert
Tresidder back into a student union
under student control, he said.
According to Szczesiul, Tresidder
management is, in fact, under stu
dent control. A majority of students
serve on the Tresidder Board, and
COP member Mary Thurber is on
the board, he said.
At the COP informational
meetings, students suggested addi
tions to Tresidder such as a pub, a
McDonald's restaurant, VCR ren
tals and a student-lounge area with
music.
"One really big need is a fun
place to be," White said. Students
have expressed two different visions
of this "fun place," White said.
Some people want a cafe atmos
phere and others, especially
graduate students, would like a pub,
he explained.
White said Tresidder currently
does not include a pub in its renova
tion plans. "We think the new Cof
fee House will be like a cafe, much
more upscale than a pub," he said.
In the meetings, students sugges
ted the Old Firehouse as a possible
site for the pub. "The Old Firehouse
is a unique place . . . and it would
be a lot less expensive to refurnish it

[than to build a new site]," White
said.
Plans for a student pub are only in
the preliminary stages, Fuentes said.
"Our plans for the Old Firehouse
will only go into action after we've
secured office space for the other or
ganizations [now using the Old
Firehouse]," he said. GLAS, Alpha
Phi Omega, the Axe Committee,
the Graduate Students Association
and Tuesday Films are among the
organizations currently using the
Old Firehouse.
GLAS would probably move if a
suitable meeting place could be
found, said Ken Ruebush, a mem
ber of the organization. Citing a
need for wheelchair access,
Ruebush said, "We were thinking of
finding a new location anyway."
Due to access problems, the Lesbian
Rap Group no longer meets in the

building, he said.
Tresidder Asst. Director Nancy
Howe, who controls liquor licensing
services on campus, said that "only
22 percent of students suggested the
need for a pub on campus" in a
recent survey. She added that the
University subsidizes the other
eating services on campus and that it
may not wish to duplicate services
by subsidizing a pub.
The University has already shown
"some acceptance to alcohol,"
Howe said. Encina Station and The
Coffee House serve beer and the
Faculty Club serves hard liquor, she
added.
White said another item of stu
dent concern is that students feel the
second floor of Tresidder is not de
signed for their use. "There is an
eerie feeling that you shouldn't be
there," White said.
