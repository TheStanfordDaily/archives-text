# Stanford heart surgeon sets pace of U.S. transplants
## FEATURES 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
I o most of the world, he is the
man who performed the first Ameri
can heart transplant. To patients
and associates, he is "Uncle Norm,"
the white-haired man in the corner
office who works 11-hour days but
still finds time to watch "M.A.S.H."
He says he's just been lucky.
It is impossible to put a label on
Norman Edward Shumway. He is
brilliant yet matter-of-fact, hard
working yet humorous, honest yet
humble, assertive vet mild
mannered, a curious combination
of a nonpareil surgeon and a

benevolent grandfather who spouts
unrepeatable jokes.
About the only certain thing is
that those qualities make up a 63-
year-old Stanford heart surgeon who
has been on the forefront of cardiac
medicine for three decades.
"Shumway, with his efforts here
in the last 20 years, has enabled the
whole world of heart transplantation
to be where it is today," said Mar
guerite Brown, coordinator of Stan
ford's heart donor program and a
long-time associate of Shumway.
"It's hard even to think about Stan
ford's heart transplant program with
out him."
But it's Shumway's beaming per

sonality as much as his skill as a sur
geon that makes him popular with
those who know him best.
"He's very rarely a person who, if
he's a little down, doesn't find a little
piece of humor to brighten things
up," Brown said. "He tries to see
something positive about every sit
uation that may not have a positive
side. He's not very intimidating for
someone who has achieved what he
has.''
"He's a one-of-a-kind fellow,''
said Thoracic Surgery Prof. James
Mark, a colleague of Shumway for
the last 20 years. "He's a superb per
son and a superb researcher."
Shumway performed the first sue

cessful heart transplant on a dog in
December 1959 and the first human
heart transplant in the United States
on Jan. 6, 1968, a few weeks
after South African Dr. Christiaan
Barnard stole the show by carrying
out the world's first heart transplant
on a human. The procedure took off
with a bang and grew into a world
wide medical fad until it became
clear that patients were dying at an
unacceptably high rate.
In the 19705, Shumway's Stan
ford program pushed on after most
hospitals had given up. Because of
his research into the body's rejection
of transplanted organs and superior
surgical techniques, Shumway's

patients were living much longer
than the average.
"We've had tremendous opportu
nity, and it's been very gratifying,"
said Shumway, as always sharing
credit with his colleagues. "And the
best cardiac surgeons in the country
are guys who have gone through this
program and are out in other medi
cal centers now leading their own
programs. We're especially proud of
that."
Aboirt 25 percent of Stanford's
heart transplant patients lived for at
least five years after operations per
formed between 1968 and 1974, 40
percent between 1974 and 1980 and 80 per
cent since 1980, when doctors began using
cyclosporine, a drug that suppresses the body's
immune system and reduces its tendency to
reject a foreign organ.
Under Shumway's leadership, a heart
transplant team of five surgeons and six resi
dents has performed 42 heart transplants so far
this year, five fewer than the total number last
year. Additionally, Shumway's team of sur
geons and researchers has done pioneering
work in heart-lung transplantation, carrying
out 36 operations in the last five years.
Shumway, chairman of the Department of
Cardiovascular Surgery since 1974, does not
hesitate to proclaim Stanford the best hospital
in the world in which to have a heart
transplant. "It's the only place with the experi
ence," he said.
"[The Department of Cardiovascular Sur
gery] may not be in a class by itself, but it
doesn't take long to call the roll," Mark said.
"Shumway is the pace-setter in the depart
ment. He's got a lot of very able people in the
department, but he's the leader."
Looking back, however, Shumway says it is
a matter of chance he ever picked up a scalpel,
much less performed history-making surgery.
He started out as a pre-law student at the
University of Michigan but, when World War
II broke out, Shumway was drafted into the in
fantry. The Army needed engineers, Shum
way remembers, and after basic training he
was assigned to an engineering college in
Texas. About six months later, however, the
Army decided it had greater need of doctors
and began searching its recruits for medical
potential.
Shumway graduated from Vanderbilt Uni
versity Medical School in 1949. He went on to
earn his doctorate at the University of Minne
sota in 1956 and, since joining Stanford in
1958 as an instructor in surgery, he has racked
up a catalog of honors and publications.
"You never know what you're going to be
doing," Shumway said. "It's like Winston
Churchill said once. He was talking about an
idea he had, and somebody said: 'That's
ridiculous, that idea.' And then Churchill
looked over at the guy and said: 'What good is
a baby?' A baby is no good, but the potential is
there. So when you have these ideas, you just
hope that maybe they'll develop, but you're
never sure. "
Shumway says the same philosophy has en
abled the Stanford program to become so ac
complished.
"Stanford is a very liberal institution," he
said. "The point is that if you could think of it
here you could do it. There aren't so many
roadblocks. . . . When I first came here in
1958, it was sort of the Wild West, so when we

wanted to do our first heart transplant on a
human, we just went ahead and did it. We
didn't have a committee meeting or a whole
bunch of administrators having to agree to it."
There may not be anything that truly both
ers Shumway, but if there is something that
comes close it is the administrative bureau
cracy that sometimes plagues the medical es
tablishment or a large institution such as Stan
ford and slows the pace of research.
"There are getting to be more and more
(regulations) today because of government in
volvement, and also the bureaucracy of the
University is getting more complicated,"
Shumway said. "Today, like when we did the
first heart-lung transplant in 1981, we have to
go through the Human Subjects Committee
to get approval. There was no Human Sub
jects Committee around when we started the
heart transplants. At the time we got under
way, things were much less complicated, and
that was very beneficial."
Shumway, however, said he does not find
that his administrative role of department
chairman takes him away from what he likes
to do best — research, surgery and working
with people.
"I can see it all the time," Shumway said.
"Someone resigns as chairman to get back to
research and teaching. Usually, that means he
either got fired or doesn't know how to appor
tion his time, because if you have a good sec
retary who understands the rules and regula
tions of the University, being chairman is not
difficult at all."
Others say Shumway's secret lies in part in
the great amount of time he spends at the of
fice and hospital. Typically, he said, he arrives
before 7 a.m. and leaves after 5 p.m. A morn
ing may include surgery and an afternoon may
hold rounds of the hospital and several
meetings.
"He's very visible in the department,"
Brown said. "Regardless of his need to be
there, he's there pretty much every day. He
enjoys what he does immensely. It's not only
the work, but the people. He's very comforta
ble in this environment."
"His patients are devoted to him," Mark
said.
Shumway, with characteristic zeal for the
department he helped create, says he and his
colleagues have so much fun and derive so
much satisfaction from their work that no one
in the department has ever taken a sabbatical.
"There's no point in taking a sabbatical," he
said, "because everything is happening right
here. People come here to take sabbaticals, so
why should we go somewhere else and
hibernate? No, it's much more fun here."
Shumway, in fact, is so dedicated to Stan
ford that his idea of a vacation is taking a

couple of days off before and after a medical
conference.
Part of the fun for Shumway and the
transplant team comes in the operating room.
Where once it would have been a crime to
crack a joke, Shumway says, it is now impor
tant to keep people calm and relaxed.
"You know the old days of surgeons throw
ing instruments and getting angry and getting
their brows wiped — those days are gone,"
Shumway said. "And thankfully they are, be
cause what would happen is that it gets
everybody else excited, and it's the patient who
suffers.
'M. A.S.H.' is the greatest program I've ever
seen on television," said Shumway, noting the
laughter-filled operating room on the television
sit-com. "The idea is to keep it light, not to get
anybody nervous, especially if things get tight;

and sometimes they do, but not often. I've seen
so many problems in my experience, it's hard to
find something we can't handle."
Operating room humor ranges from refer
ring to heart surgery as a "valve job"' and in
struments as "jumper cables'' to Shumway's
favorite, poking fun at the Mayo Clinic, a
leading medical center in Rochester, Minn.
"We try to have new jokes," Shumway said.
"It's not like some guy giving a lecture and
having the same jokes year in and year out.
We always call the Mayo Clinic 'charm school'
because everything they do there is just neat
and beautiful. So we'll frequently get the tow
els out and get everything nice like the Mayo
Clinic. We have all these visitors, and so I'll
tell them: 'Doesn't that look just like the Mayo

Clinic?'
Despite growing problems with
regulations, bureaucracy and cost,
Shumway is optimistic about the
future of cardiovascular surgery.
Hearts from brain-dead accident vic
tims are becoming more and more
available thanks to increased public
awareness of an acute shortage of
donor organs.
Scientists are also developing a
drug that would convince a recipient
body that a transplanted organ, pos
sibly from a primate, is the real
thing. Emergency room and inten
sive care personnel around the
country are taking instruction on
how to care for lungs in order to
preserve the especially delicate or
gans for transplantation. Heart

transplants for infants in the first few
weeks of life are now available and
becoming more successful.
As long as he occupies the corner
office in Stanford's new $14 million
Cardiovascular Research Building,
Shumway will continue to be the
kingpin, admired and loved by his
colleagues, in Stanford's heart sur
gery program. But the effect he has
had in the training of countless sur
geons who have passed through
Stanford in the last 30 years will
spread his influence much farther
than the history books and Stan
ford's labs.
Shumway says he expects to see
some of the anticipated
breakthroughs in his lifetime, while
others he admits are further away.
But to Shumway, perhaps the only
man to be believed when he called
the heart transplant a "relatively
simple" operation, "The possibilities
are fantastic — almost endless."
