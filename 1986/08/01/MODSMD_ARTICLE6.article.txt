# Stanford heart surgeon sets pace of U.S. transplants
## FEATURES 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
I o most of the world, he is the
man who performed the first Ameri
can heart transplant. To patients
and associates, he is "Uncle Norm,"
the white-haired man in the corner
office who works 11-hour days but
still finds time to watch "M.A.S.H."
He says he's just been lucky.
It is impossible to put a label on
Norman Edward Shumway. He is
brilliant yet matter-of-fact, hard
working yet humorous, honest yet
humble, assertive vet mild
mannered, a curious combination
of a nonpareil surgeon and a

benevolent grandfather who spouts
unrepeatable jokes.
About the only certain thing is
that those qualities make up a 63-
year-old Stanford heart surgeon who
has been on the forefront of cardiac
medicine for three decades.
"Shumway, with his efforts here
in the last 20 years, has enabled the
whole world of heart transplantation
to be where it is today," said Mar
guerite Brown, coordinator of Stan
ford's heart donor program and a
long-time associate of Shumway.
"It's hard even to think about Stan
ford's heart transplant program with
out him."
But it's Shumway's beaming per

sonality as much as his skill as a sur
geon that makes him popular with
those who know him best.
"He's very rarely a person who, if
he's a little down, doesn't find a little
piece of humor to brighten things
up," Brown said. "He tries to see
something positive about every sit
uation that may not have a positive
side. He's not very intimidating for
someone who has achieved what he
has.''
"He's a one-of-a-kind fellow,''
said Thoracic Surgery Prof. James
Mark, a colleague of Shumway for
the last 20 years. "He's a superb per
son and a superb researcher."
Shumway performed the first sue

cessful heart transplant on a dog in
December 1959 and the first human
heart transplant in the United States
on Jan. 6, 1968, a few weeks
after South African Dr. Christiaan
Barnard stole the show by carrying
out the world's first heart transplant
on a human. The procedure took off
with a bang and grew into a world
wide medical fad until it became
clear that patients were dying at an
unacceptably high rate.
In the 19705, Shumway's Stan
ford program pushed on after most
hospitals had given up. Because of
his research into the body's rejection
of transplanted organs and superior
surgical techniques, Shumway's

patients were living much longer
than the average.
"We've had tremendous opportu
nity, and it's been very gratifying,"
said Shumway, as always sharing
credit with his colleagues. "And the
best cardiac surgeons in the country
are guys who have gone through this
program and are out in other medi
cal centers now leading their own
programs. We're especially proud of
that."
Aboirt 25 percent of Stanford's
heart transplant patients lived for at
least five years after operations per
