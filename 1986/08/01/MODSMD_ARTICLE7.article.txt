### JULIE WIDMAN Staff writer 
A geriatric consultation service at Stanford will
receive a $399,150 grant, the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation announced Tuesday.
The program, which will last for 42 months, will
study ways to improve hospital treatment of elderly
people, according to Barbara Kehrer, vice president of
the Kaiser Family Foundation.
A consultation team made up of various physicians, a
dietician, a nurse and residents will provide consultation
when an elderly patient is admitted to the hospital, Keh
rer explained.
According to Kehrer, hospital staff, not sensitive to
the fact that elderly patients can have the potential to
improve their condition, are more inclined to send
them to nursing homes.
"We're trying to arrest this decline, and we think the
consultation program would help," she said.

The Kaiser Family Foundation funds several pro
grams to improve health care, Kehrer said. After receiv
ing proposals from various organizations, the founda
tion reviews them, gets advice from outside experts and
decides whether to fund a program based on its relative
merits and on the amount of money the foundation has
according to Kehrer.
Although the foundation has donated the money for
the research, the Palo Alto Veterans Administration
Medical Center will pay for the actual consultation, she
added.
The grant is part of a Kaiser endowment of nearly $1
million presented to Stanford last April. At that time,
$550,000 of the grant was earmarked for a Health
Promotion Resource Center. The center's purpose has
been to help communities promote health and it focuses
on heart disease, alcohol and drug abuse, teenage preg
nancy, cancer and injuries, said Ron Goben, the Medi
cal Center's associate communication director.
Stanford was among several recipients of the Kaiser
grants, which totaled over $3. 5 million.
