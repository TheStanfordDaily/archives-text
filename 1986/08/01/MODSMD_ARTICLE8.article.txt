### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Editorial staff 
Purchasers of Stanford parking
permits will have to pay an extra 10
percent for the 1986-87 academic
year, according to the University Of
fice of Transportation Programs.
"A" parking permits will cost
$110, a $10 increase, and "C" and
"Resident Student" permits will cost
an additional $2, starting in Septem
ber, according to Dennis Perkinson,
manager of Transportation Pro
grams. Perkinson referred to the in
creases as "the best solution to a bad
situation."
He said the price adjustment was
due to a rise in inflation, operating
costs and salaries. The Office of
Transportation looked at a "variety
of options," ranging from no in
crease to a "radical" one, Perkinson
said.
The price change also "provides
for a modest annual increase," so as
to avoid another significant jump in
price in the future. There has been
no increase in parking stickers for
three years and no fee increases in
six years, Perkinson said.
Perkinson said the Office of
Transportation was "eroding
reserves over the past year and this
year operated at a loss."
The Office of Transportation sells
an estimated 20,000 permits per
year, including resident student per
mits, Perkinson said. Its total reve
nue is approximately $500,000.
Programs funded by parking per-

Mit fees include the Department of
Public Safety, which enforces
parking regulations and ad
ministrates the University's vehicle
registration system, Marguerite
operations, "commute alternative"
programs and certain bicycle safety
projects.
In addition to the permit fee in
creases, many of the "green zones"
that are designated for limited
parking time will be converted to
meters, Perkinson said. The meters
were not installed to obtain addi
tional funds, but rather to help regu
late parking sites. He added that
meters tend to increase availability
of parking spaces, a possible advan
tage to the added cost.
Stanford provides plenty of
parking at affordable prices in com
parison to other institutions, accord
ing to a parking survey conducted
recently by Perkinson's office. At
Cornell, for example, the ratio of
staff and visitor parking spaces to
employees is 0. 54, while Stanford's
is 0.79 per employee. The national
standard for universities is 0.70
spaces per employee, according to
the survey.
Permit prices at universities across
the country vary as well, the survey
states. Stanford's "C" permit is
cheaper than employee permits at
any of the universities surveyed.
California State University at
Long Beach charges a flat fee of $68
for all campus parking permits. At
UCLA, all parkers have to pay $162.
Duke charges up to $190.
