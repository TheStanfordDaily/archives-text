## Reagan stifles Rehnquist's Nixon-era memos 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan invoked executive privilege
last night to deny Senate Judiciary
Committee Democrats any access to
internal memos Chief Justice desig
nate William Rehnquist wrote when
he was in the Nixon Administration
Justice Department.
Asst. Attorney General John Bol
ton made the announcement in the
committee room about 5 p.m.
PDT, just after Rehnquist con
cluded his second day of testimony
at his confirmation hearings. Bolton
said the Administration was invok
ing the controversial executive
privilege doctrine to protect the con
fidentiality and candor of the legal
advice received by presidents and
their assistants.
Democrats, some of whom had
left, returned hurriedly and reacted
angrily upon hearing of the unusual
action. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) called it "stonewalling" and
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-
Ohio) charged a "cover-up."
But it was uncertain last night
what, if anything, the Democrats

could do about the withholding of
the memos. Committee sources said
they did not have the votes necessary
to subpoena the memos and provoke
a court battle.
Kennedy told Bolton that the
Justice Department was "doing a
disservice" to Rehnquist, who had
agreed to the release of the docu
ments. Kennedy said he could not
"reach any other conclusion but that
the Administration is stonewalling."
Kennedy noted that the period
during which Rehnquist served as
assistant attorney general in charge
of the Justice Department's Office of
Legal Counsel — 1969 to 1971 —
was a time of such controversial ac
tivities as Army surveillance of anti
war dissidents, illegal CIA domestic
operations and the Huston plan to
step up government spying in the
United States.
The department's legal counsel is
often called upon for opinions —
formal and informal — on the
legality of Administration policy.
Rehnquist's public defenses of
Nixon Administration policies on

wiretapping, surveillance and mass
arrests of anti-war protesters were a
source of considerable controversy
then. Selected opinions by the legal
counsel have been regularly pub
lished since 1977.

"Human experience," Bolton told
the committee, "teaches that those
who expect public dissemination of
their remarks may well temper can
dor with a concern for appearances
. . . to the detriment of the

decision-making process. He said
the privilege was not "being lightly
invoked" and that the Administra
tion was acting "for the benefit of
the Republic.''
Sen. Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.)
criticized the department last night
for issuing a "blanket exception" and
said, "I think you all are making a
big mistake."
Metzenbaum told Bolton he
thought the action was a "deliberate
cover-up."
It did not appear likely that the
Republican-controlled committee
would subpoena the documents.
Mark Goodin, aide to Chairman
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.)
said he thought the action "would
end it. They (committee Demo
crats) are obviously on a fishing ex
pedition, and they need the docu
ments now," he said. "They are not
interested in a protracted legal
fight," which could result in a
lengthy delay in the confirmation
process.
"There just isn't much we can
do," said a key Democratic staff

member who asked not to be identi
fied.
Executive privilege "is a very
murky field," said A.E. Dick
Howard, a constitutional law
scholar at the University of Virginia.
When one branch is battling with
another, he said, "courts tend to step
aside. The resolution is typically po
litical, not judicial."
The Supreme Court explicitly ac
cepted the validity of "executive
privilege" in 1974 in U.S. vs.
Nixon, when the justices nonethe
less ordered President Nixon to turn
over White House tapes to the spe
cial prosecutor investigating the
Watergate scandal. However, the
court said in a footnote that its deci
sion did not address the issue of the
scope of executive privilege in the
face of congressional demands.
Earlier yesterday, the hearing
empted into partisan quarreling after
Democrats disclosed that the deed
for the Rehnquist's former home in
Phoenix, Ariz., included language
to bar non-whites from owning the
property.
