## UK stand on Pretoria softer than Commonwealth's 
### 
LONDON — Six Commonwealth countries agreed to harsh
sanctions against South Africa yesterday, but Britain held out
and agreed to introduce only a limited package.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, addressing
reporters at a news conference late last night, said she had com
promised in the interests of Commonwealth unity despite her
belief that sanctions will not end apartheid.
"It has not been an easy conference," Thatcher said. "I don't
believe that further sanctions will bring about internal change
in South Africa . . . but the others were bent on further ac
tion.''
"We certainly have done things which are a compromise
and take our membership of the Commonwealth into ac
count," she said.
The six other countries agreed to impose 11 new sanctions
against South Africa, including cutting air links, which could
cripple the national airlines of Zambia and Zimbabwe, the two
African countries at the confercnce.
Apart from the African nations, Australia, India, Canada
and the Bahamas all agreed to the measures, which are now
virtually certain to be implemented by the rest of the 49-nation
association of Britain and its former colonies.
In a statement issued by Sir Lynden Pindling, the
conference chairman, the six Commonwealth nations ex

pressed "concern and regret" that Britain had refused to join
their accord.
Asked about threats by Zambia to withdraw from the Com
monwealth if Britain held out, Pindling said, "No, I don't
think so, 1 don't think we are on that road to any member of the
Commonwealth leaving."
Thatcher said earlier that she still believed sanctions were
wrong, but she announced an immediate "voluntary" ban
against British investment in South Africa and promotion of
tourism to that country, a British official said.
She said the actions must be voluntary by Britons because
the government had no exchange controls or powers to order
publications to stop printing, for example, advertisements on
South African tourism.
Another promise made by the prime minister was that Brit
ain would not oppose bans on imports of South African steel,
coal and iron due to be debated by the European Community
next month.
The British official said she would not shift her position fur
ther for the sake of unity in the Commonwealth, the 49-
member association of Britain and its former colonies.
Her offer fell far short of eight specific sanctions demanded
by the other countries, including cutting air links and ending
agricultural imports.

Cutting air links would cost state-owned British Airways, a
major foreign carrier into South Africa, $1.5 million a week.
About 158 million pounds ($l7l million) of Britain's 1 billion
pound annual trade with South Africa consists of agricultural
produce.
Patsy Robertson, a spokeswoman for the Commonwealth
secretariat, said, "The Commonwealth, other than Britain,
feels strongly if there has to be a choice between unity and
credibility, the time has come for the Commonwealth to be
seen to be credible on the issue.
She announced that the six other leaders had rejected the
Thatcher offer made in a morning closed session.
"They feel that the Commonwealth has taken a lead for the
past 25 years on the issue," she said. "They feel that the black
people of South Africa and many of the white people there who
want change are watching very carefully what the Common
wealth is doing."
A British official who announced the Thatcher offer after the
morning session declared: "This is in the interests of solidarity.
It is a demonstration of disgust and clearly it is a gesture toward
the Commonwealth too . . . if the Commonwealth chooses to
take it."
He said Britain would implement the measures it had cho
sen whatever the rest of the Commonwealth did.
