# Reagan declares offensive against drug abuse

### 
WASHINGTON - President Reagan,
saying rampant drug abuse is reaping "sorrow
and heartbreak" across America, launched a
campaign yesterday to purge schools and
workplaces of illicit drugs.
Reagan unveiled a six-point program to
coax people off drugs and embraced a combi
nation of mandatory and voluntary tests of
both government and private employees.
In a national broadcast appearance, Reagan
credited his wife Nancy with working hard to
get kids to "say no" to drugs, and said that
"starting today, Nancy's crusade to deprive the
drug peddlers and suppliers of their customers
becomes America's crusade. "
During a brief question-and-answer session,
Reagan acknowledged that he had only
recently taken a high-profile role in the Ad
ministration's quest to combat drug abuse.
"We hadn't before put the effort that we recog
nize now, should be put . . . and that is . . .

the time has come for a nationwide crusade,"
he said.
In the United States, there are an estimated
3 million to 5 million regular users of cocaine,
18 million to 20 million regular users of mari
juana, and 10 million alcoholics.
A senior Administration official, briefing
reporters later on the condition he not be iden
tified by name, said, "I don't think anyone has
said make mandatory drug testing a condition
of employment. " However, the official added,
"We're going to ask corporate America to ex
pand" drug testing.
Reagan outlined six broad goals encompass
ing his plan to attack a growing problem that
he said costs business $100 million a year.
Among them, he said, is a plan to create a
drug-free workplace for all Americans, getting
drugs out of schools, improving efforts to in
form people of the dangers of drugs, and step
ping up law enforcement dnig interdiction ef

forts and attempts to get other nations to
cooperate.
Reagan would not say how much the new
initiative will cost, nor reveal what plans, if
any, the Administration has for asking
Congress to improve new spending plans or
supplement programs already in effect. He did
say, however, that "the solution does not lie
simply within the realm of government.
"It is time to go beyond government,"
Reagan said. "All the confiscation and law en
forcement in the world will not cure this
plague as long as it is kept alive by public ac
quiescence. So, we must go beyond efforts
aimed only at affecting the supply of drugs.
We must affect not only supply, but demand."
Reagan stopped short of announcing a pro
gram of drug screening for federal employees
â€” a drug-fighting option that has been heavily
publicized in recent days. But he said he has
suggested that members of the Cabinet take

drug tests, if that would set an example.
"I think we're pretty much agreed that man
datory testing is justified where the employees
have the health of others, the safety of others,
in their hands," Reagan said, referring to law
enforcement authorities, air traffic controllers
and the like in the federal workforce.
"On the other hand, I think we're pretty
much agreed that what we should seek is vo
luntary" testing among federal employees,
with the notion of "setting a pattern, an exam
ple, for society."
House Majority Leader Jim Wright (D-
Texas) hailed Reagan's speech, saying, "We
are encouraged by the fact he is awakened to
the reality of the problem. Apparently he ap
preciates the dimensions of the problem."
Wright, however, said the government's
current annual expenditure of $3 million for
drug education is like "trying to fight a bear
with a fly swatter."
