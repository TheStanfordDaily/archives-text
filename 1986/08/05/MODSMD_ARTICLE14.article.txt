Helms says he's victim of mud slinging
WASHINGTON Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) yesterday bitterly
accused the State Department s overseer for American policy of
orchestrating a smear campaign as the FBI began checking charges
that sensitive intelligence data was leaked to Chile's right-wing mili
tary government through Helms' office.
Helms, his comments filled with sarcasm and indignation, claimed
that Asst. Secretary of State Elliott Abrams triggered the investigation
by concocting the Chilean story to discredit the senator and then
secretly passing it to leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
who then relayed it to federal agents.
A staunch defender of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dic
tator, Helms charged that State Department officials are attempting to
"silence" him because he opposed their policy on Chile.
At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman denied that
the agency had requested the investigation. But, when asked specifi
cally whether the Senate Select Intelligence Committee's request for
the FBI inquiry followed an appearance by Abrams before the panel,
Redman merely smiled enigmatically.
Rehnquist memos quest to continue
WASHINGTON — Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee, preparing to shift its focus today to the Supreme Court nomina
tion of Judge Antonin Scalia, nevertheless vowed yesterday to press
ahead with efforts to subpoena Justice Department memos written by
Justice William Rehnquist.
An aide to Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), the committee chair
man, said the senator intends to complete the Scalia hearings even if a
majority supports the subpoena of the Rehnquist documents, con
tending that the panel must vote on both nominees before the Senate
recesses in just over a week.
About 40 witnesses, many opposed to Scalia's conservative judicial
philosophy, are seeking to testify at the hearings. But a required FBI
background check of Scalia, now a judge on the U.S. Court of Ap
peals for the District of Columbia, appears to raise no "surprise" issues
— such as racial and religious restrictions discovered in Rehnquist's
property deeds, a source familiar with the inquiry said.
Four days of hearings on Rehnquist's nomination to be chief justice
wound up Friday, without resolving a request by three committee
Democrats for memos Rehnquist wrote from 1969 to 1971 when he
was assistant attorney general in the Nixon Administration. President
Reagan invoked executive privilege Thursday to withhold some of the
memos from committee Democrats.
Today's votes to affect '88 GOP race
LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Republicans will cast the nation's
first votes affecting the 1988 GOP presidential nomination race today
at a time when surveys show that two-thirds haven't yet decided whom
they support and most of the rest don't know how to register their pref
erence.
Still, even with the murkiness of the playing field and the apparent
blindness of the vote, campaign organizations representing Vice Presi
dent George Bush, television evangelist Marion "Pat" Robertson and
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) have invested more than $1.5 million and
substantial political capital trying to influence the election of as many
as 14,500 precinct delegates in today's primary.
