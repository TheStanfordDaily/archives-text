OPEC agrees on a price-fix
GENEVA â€” OPEC oil ministers reached unani
mous agreement last night on Iran's proposal for a
drastic production cut to raise prices, the cartel's pres
ident said.
Rilwanu Lukman, who also is the Nigerian oil
minister, gave no details. "You'll hear all about it to
morrow (Tuesday),'' he told reporters as he emerged
from a Geneva hotel following the late-night meeting
of the 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Another meeting was sched
uled today.
Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh had
told a news conference earlier he was very optimistic
about the production cut plan. The cartel's biggest

producer, Saudi Arabia, had remained among the
few holdouts.
Oil industry analysts consider a unanimous agree
ment by OPEC members on production cuts crucial
to reversing a worldwide slump in prices, which have
dropped from $32 a barrel late last year to as low as
$7.35 for some grades.
By not requiring production cutbacks from Iraq, its
enemy in the 6-year-old Persian Gulf War, Iran ap
peared to remove, a major stumbling block to the
quota-sharing agreement OPEC has been vainly
seeking for years.
The events came as OPEC oil ministers entered
the second week of talks in their fourth attempt in
recent months to reach agreement on lowering out
put and boosting prices.
The plan seeks a return to the quotas used in Octo
ber 1984.
