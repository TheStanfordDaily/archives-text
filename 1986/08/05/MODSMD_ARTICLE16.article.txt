To: James Lyons, Dean of Student Affairs
Welcome back, Jim. We've missed you.
Summer is a fine time to take a little break from the routine, and we
hope you are well rested for the coming months. Unfortunately, the
world kept turning while you were away, and work has been piling up
on your desk just as vacationers crowd onto an island paradise.
We would like to take this opportunity to help you mop up a little of
this nagging backlog and make a few suggestions along the way.
For starters, sitting patiently on your desk are plans for the proposed
Police Advisory Board. Because you are the only administrator
working with students to establish the new board, the issue has come
to a grinding halt in your absence.
Students had expected plans for the board to be finished in June,
but the final proposal for University President Donald Kennedy's ap
proval is still not ready. We have been waiting a long time; support for
the board first began after anti-apartheid protesters at an October sit-in
accused arresting officers of brutality.
It is vital that work on this advisory board be completed as soon as
possible. There is no reason for the board not to begin meeting in the
fall.
Overall, the tone of negotiations has been positive. Student plan
ners say that the University has been agreeable in meetings regarding
the board. Students have welcomed the University's suggestions to ex
pand the board's original duties. Plans now call for the board to estab
lish a dialogue with police on specific issues and to attempt to lower
the on-campus crime rate.
Amid this broader definition of the board's duties, however, is COP
Member Carey White's concern that planners will become distracted
by these two new tasks. If-this happens, White warns, planners could
lose sight of what the board was originally intended to do: to lobby for
policies that would prevent peaceful protesters from being harmed
during arrests.
We share this concern, Dean Lyons, and urge you to help make
this advisory board a viable solution to the ugly problem that surfaced
last October.
One way to ensure that the advisory board is successful is to give the
board the power to investigate individual complaints. Currently, the
plans call for the new commission to examine trends in complaints,
but this overly broad method of battling the problem is disappointing
and simply will not work.
Had the board existed during the Octobcr incident it probably
would not have been empowered to investigate the case. Instead, it
would have spent its time looking for a long-term trend in stu
dent/police relations.
The Stanford community deserves more than a board that spends its
time looking for trends on graph paper and making check marks in a
ledger titled: "claims of police brutality."
We hope, Dean Lyons, that these suggestions make your first few
days back a little smoother. And again let us say, "Welcome back."
