Divestment not it
I've been a graduate student at
Stanford for three years. There's
been a lot of talk, some protests, a
few shanties . . . more words, some
"symbolic" selective divestments
. . . and life in South Africa has
cojjfinued on, obviously, cruelly
and as harshly as ever. Nothing
really has changed, certainly not for
the better.
People speak of divestment as
though it actually will directly help
to effect change, to eliminate apart
heid: "Divest NOW!'' they chant.
Maybe I'm ignorant and misin
formed; if so, someone who knows
better, please correct me.
Here's how I see things: Divest
ment in itself does nothing to di
rectly stop apartheid. True, it does
serve a "consciousness-raising" func
tion here in America. But we must
not be deluded. It does nothing to
end the capitalistic greed for money
which will continue to drive com
panies to invest in South Africa,
where they can reap huge profits
from the sufferings of others.
Let's be realistic. We may divest
ourselves from South Africa by sel
ling our stock. "I don't own stock in
companies doing business in South
Africa,'' we proudly say, guilt free,
satisfied that we have done our part.
But someone else bought our stock.
We have only passed the buck and
settled into happy complacency.
Owning stock gives us a voice, a

voice which here at Stanford has
been used only in whispers, if at all.
Not using this voice we have
bought — not shouting — this too is
an avoidance of responsibility and
does nothing to end apartheid. '
As I see it, there is only one way I
as an individual can have a truly
direct effect, can actually have a
voice in the struggle to end the in
equities and abominations that are
apartheid: I can stop buying prod
ucts with ingredients from South
Africa. To South Africa and the cor
porations which profit from apart
heid, loss of revenue will speak
louder than conflicting and disor
ganized public opinion.
I do not plan to buy gold or
diamonds in the near future. I will
forgo the luxury of opulent shiny
chrome fenders on my bike and car.
I ask you to do the same, and if you
own stock in South Africa, as Stan
ford does, please don't pretend to
look the other way or symbolically
and cosmetically pass the buck: Use
the voice you've bought — yell and
scream and kick and bite until you
become too unsightly, too embar
rassing to be ignored.
If you decide to cop out, to ignore
the responsibility and challenge, at
least sell the stock back to the com
pany you've invested in, not to
someone else who wants to buy it,
someone who doesn't give a crap.
