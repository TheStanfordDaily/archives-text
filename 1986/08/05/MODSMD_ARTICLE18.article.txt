# Just how funny is funny?
## 
### 
I learned a lot about comedy in San Francisco Satur
day afternoon. For instance, some comedians are much
funnier than others. And six hours of comedy is a little
too much. And the stonefish is the deadliest fish in the
world.
For those of you who don't yet perceive, I am speak
ing of the City's annual comedy festival, held this year
amid obscuring shrubbery in Golden Gate Park.
Seventy-five humorists, allotted three to five minutes
each, entertaining from noon until 6:30 p.m., equals a
total of — and you can check me on this — six and one
half hours.

"It's great to be here in San Francisco," too many
comics said. And few seemed to have bothered to listen
to their colleagues who had already enjoyed their mo
ment in the snn. Too many repetitive jokes were made
about automobile "Baby On Board" signs, Chernobyl
and Mr. Potato Head dolls.
Some comics had their moments, however.
"The most romantic thing a woman ever said to me
was, 'You sure you're not a cop?' " comedian Larry
"Bubbles" Brown told the audience of some 45,000
men, women, children and others.
"I can't wait to see the new Star Trek movie," San
Francisco comic Kevin Pollack insisted. " 'Star Trek IV:
The Search for Cash.' "
Others poked fun at the City itself, one performer
claiming that his friends from Haight-Ashbury are "so
mellow they only got back from Woodstock yesterday."
One comedienne described her acute loneliness and

isolation as a child, complaining that her parents
"rubbed it in" by buying her a see-saw.
But by 4:30, I had had enough.
"I have had enough," I said. "I am going for a walk."
I was not speaking to myself, as I was with friends. But
they opted to remain, sitting on a picnic blanket under
cloudy skies, eating grapes and cookies and listening to
the prime San Francisco comedy.
I stepped out of the crowded park, across the street,
and found the City Aquarium, which I had not visited
since I was 12 years old.
I paid $3 and escaped comedians for the solitude of
fishtanks. The stonefish, as I previously mentioned, is
the most dangerous fish in the world, its spines contain
ing deadly venom. I stared at it through the glass and
noticed that its eyes stared in different di r ections. I
swayed back and forth with my head bent to the glass to
see if it would turn its head to follow me but moved on
when I noticed people looking at me and whispering.
The piranha is really not very dangerous at all, I read.
Rarely do they attack man. Victims of the media.
And the dolphins seemed very intelligent, some
scooping up rings with their fins as they swam, gazing at
their audience with slight, enigmatic smiles.
"Look at those animals swimming with the dolphins,
Martha," a man with frizzy hair said. "Those must be
walruses."
Otters, you fool, I thought.
I grew restive. Would I miss closing comedian Robin
Williams? No. He showed up when I did.
He wasn't bad, although I'm not a big fan of his sort
of comedy — fast, frantic, stream of consciousness.
"Don't you think God smokes pot?" he asked the park
crowd. "How else do you explain the platypus?"
All in all, a very enlightening (although freezing cold)
day. But I felt sorry for the unfunny comedians. I felt
sorry for the piranhas. And the lady with the see-saw.
But especially for any yodel that can't distinguish a
walrus from an otter. Hrrrmph.
