# USW sues University over grievance system
## 
### THOMAS OSCHERWITZ Staff writer 
United Stanford Workers (USW) officials
filed a suit in federal district court last week
charging that the University is not arbitrating
grievances submitted under the labor contract
signed last year.
In its suit, the union said the University is
still hearing the backlog of arbitrations filed
during the life of the old contract.
"We want the judge to order the University
to schedule the cases under this (new) contract
right away,'' USW Staff Counsel Mary Ann
Tenuto said.
The University only recently received the
summons, but its policy regarding arbitrations
is in accordance with the new contract, ac
cording to University Staff Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler.
Currently, the University schedules arbitra
tion proceedings in the order that they were
submitted by the union. Hearings involving
the firing of an employee are the only excep
tion to the rule. These cases are scheduled for
the earliest possible date.
In paragraph 28 of the new contract, the
USW and the University agreed to handle the
arbitration backlog chronologically, Wheeler
said.

cause of the severe nature of the charge, she
added.
Union officials agree that an interim agree
ment signed in 1984 called for the University
to handle grievances chronologically, but the
new contract signed in 1985 requires that new
grievances be heard, Tenuto said.
"The University is violating the terms of the
new contract," she said.
The union proposes that USW and the
University try to "bargain" over each of the
older cases, Tenuto said.
If agreements on these issues can't be
reached, additional hearing dates could be in
serted in gaps not filled by the new hearings,
she said.
The union filed the suit because the inter
pretation of the current contract will be impor
tant when the union negotiates its next con
tract in 1988, according to USW President
Tim Johnson.
" The reason this dispute is important
enough to take court action is because the
practical effect of the administration's position
is to preclude the resolution of disputes over
contract interpretation before we renegotiate
the contract in 1988," Johnson said in a news
release.
"This is not a good situation for either party
to be in when contract negotiations begin. We
need to know what our contract language
