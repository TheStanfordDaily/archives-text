# VIEWPOINT
## The
						Reagan blunders live on and on . . . 
### 
Ronald Reagan's recent and pathetic speech
and apologies for apartheid angers me greatly,
so I feel the need to dissipate through script.
The issue is clear: He would prefer to see
black South Africans remain in bondage and
victimized by genocide than to risk a post
revolutionary government there that may not
be sympathetic to the United States. The
problem, and he is too dumb to understand it,
is that his stupidity is contributing to this possi
bility, in spite of the fact that the country is en
titled to establish whatever form of govern
ment the electorate there desires. As blacks in
South Africa die, as they continue to live a
miserable life at the hands of a racist govern
ment, Reagan will not support any action un
less the welfare of white South Africans is
assured.

HENRY ORGAN

Why not equal concern for the current
welfare of blacks there? How shortsighted?
How inconsistent? How racist! If a reversal of
roles were to occur in South Africa, would
Reagan continue with a policy of
"constructive engagement?" "Quiet
diplomacy?" Opposition to economic sanc
tions? Of course not! Reagan would have
troops there, not just economic sanctions, as
quickly as he can say "Khadafy."
In his simplistic, cowboy mentality, every
one who opposes him is "cut and run." David
Stockman has affirmed to the general public
that which it already knew: . Reagan cannot,
does not, and does not desire to understand
complex issues. He is comfortable with horses
because the functional vocabulary is not too
demanding: it's "gee and haw," and not much
more.
After having witnessed once again Reagan's
progressive senility on this issue and others,
the University's position that the proper solu
tion to destroying (dismantling is no longer the
appropriate word here) apartheid is at the
federal level is highly questionable. Anything
more than symbolic bills by Congress will
surely be vetoed by Reagan, and those vetoes

will survive any override attempts.
Reflective of the highest form of self
adulation, Reagan has been talking about the
two-term limitation on the office of the presi
dent, for which I am for the moment ex
tremely grateful. I have a suggestion, if he is
interested in continuing in public service. He
is free to run for the president of South Africa,
and he would win by another landslide under
the present form of government there! Imag
ine Botha and Reagan debating, trying to show
who is the most racist. Such a debate would
give Reagan an opportunity to resume describ
ing his meandering along some coastal high
way, which was interrupted during his debate
with Sen. Mondale. I'd like to know where in
hell he was going.
I suspect the citizens of this country feel ut
ter disgust when Reagan is with heads of other
governments — mainly individuals who are
accomplished in some respect. Here we have
an overrated, unrated actor-comedian who
cannot make two consecutive, coherent and
flawless sentences without benefit of a
TelePrompTer. Which brings me to the sub
ject of the Ronald Reagan Library.
I wonder if Reagan has been in a library
since his required study period in high school.
Obviously, knowledge is not one of his strong
points; his anti-intellectualism days as a UC
regent clearly suggests that he detests scholars
and scholasticism, and this pattern is reflected
in most of his choices of staff, cabinet mem
bers, judicial appointees and social friends.
This man actually prefers and rewards
mediocrity.
I cannot say I am looking forward to the
opening of the library. PIT will televise its
program that day from the premises. In true
free enterprise spirit, Mickey Mouse and
Goofy will probably lead the procession on the
grounds scattering red, white, blue and yellow
jelly beans to the masses of flag-wavers.
(Minnie Mouse will boycott the event because
Reagan does not support the ERA.) There will
be a fly-over by the Blue Angels, to whom
Reagan will give his patented snappy salute.
Jimmy Swaggart will give an inspiring con

vocation. The pledge of allegiance will be
next, led by Jesse Helms. The Beach Boys will
sing "God Bless America." Dick Nixon, a fel
low Californian and a man of like ethics, will
provide the keynote address. The stages will be
surrounded by artificial flowers. Clarence
Pendleton will be one of the platform guests to
add a bit of color to this loony pageantry'.
(Deukmejian would have been one, but his to
tally political move on UC divestiture has
clearly eliminated him.)

With his ever-present
TelePrompTers flanking
him, Reagan will thank
the University for
persuading him to locate
the library here.

With his ever-present TelePrompTers
flanking him, Reagan will thank the Univer
sity for persuading him to locate the library
here. He will then plant a lemon tree, make
an imprint of his hand in fresh cement at the
entrance, and join loving hands with Nancy to
cut the ribbon. The Marine Corps Reserve
band will play a Wagnerian rendition of "It's
All Right Now" softly in the background. (The
opening will occur in the summer to mini
mize the possibility of student disruption, so
The Incomparables and the Dollies will not be
available.)
My guess is that it will be July 4th —
patriotic, right? The Dallas Cowboy cheer
leaders will sub for the Dollies. The Good
Reverend Falwell will deliver a thundering
benediction. (Pat Robertson, to Bob Bush's
dismay, is scheduled to back up Falwell if he is
not available that day.)
The library will be a beauty. The construe

tion contract will be awarded to a client of Mi
chael Deaver's. The red tiles will be made of
plastic. It will be landscaped with rolling astro
turf; an artificial waterfall will be visible from
280. It will be surrounded with palm trees,
with flood lights targeted at their tops for maxi
mum effect at night, giving it that Hollywood
feeling.
The flag out front will be larger than the
one in front of the car dealer on El Camino,
and the flag pole will be constructed of Teflon.
All office doors will open to the right for enter
ing, and all lavatory fixtures will be for right
hand utilization. The dominant color will be
"White House blue." (Coincidentally, the en
trance to the building is planned to be on a
line with the "Gates of Hell" sculpture in the
Rodin Garden.) There will be a John Wayne
Memorial Room that will contain a bust of
"The Duke" with a 10-gallon hat. The room
will contain portraits of freedom fighters and
heroes.
The library will be entertaining, if not
scholarly. A Reagan film will be shown every
Saturday afternoon for the kids. The library
collection, otherwise, is still a mystery because
it is supposed to consist of materials worthy of
scholarly research. Thus, research of Reagan's
entire memoirs by scholars should take every
bit of three hours, including an extended
lunch.
What is this liebrary? Will I have to be
finger-printed to enter? Will students have to
show their draft registrations? Will AIDS tests
be required? Will polygraph test results of all
his cabinet members be in the collections?
Will it contain the litmus tests for judicial can
didates? Will it include copies of many
criminal indictments of his appointees to of
fice? Will it include the calculator Stockman
gave him upon announcing his resignation,
and will the mirrors he used to establish the
budget hang in the lobby? Will it include the
original copies of his authorization to mine
harbors in South America?
I can hardly wait!
