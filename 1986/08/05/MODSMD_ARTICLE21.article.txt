## Movement offers spiritual alternatives in Los Altos 
### JAMES LIN Staff writer 
The bright orange turban and
robes that Dada Ami Tabha wears,
have both a spiritual and a practical
function.
The color orange, he explains,
helps free the mind for effective
meditation. It also, not surprisingly,
makes Tabha easily identifiable as a
full-time staff worker for Ananda
Marga, an international yoga and
meditation group that sponsors a va
riety of social service projects.
Ananda Marga, which has a local
chapter on Moody Road in Los Altos
Hills, is not a religious cult, but calls
itself instead "a movement dedicated
to the establishment of a universal
human society." The 50 active
members of the Los Altos Hills unit,
who meditate individually twice
each day and also as a group once a
week, sponsor a school for kinder
garten and first grade students and
work with the United Way to pro
vide meals for the homeless in
Menlo Park.
Most members are Peninsula
business professionals. Unlike
Tabha, they wear non-distinctive
clothing and are not bound by di
etary restrictions. They are drawn to
Ananda Marga by its yoga and medi
tation classes, pragmatic goals and
social and spiritual programs.
All the members, even those who
live at the Moody Road center, sup
port themselves financially, Tabha
said.
"I have to eat," said Gail Pollard,
who works as a secretary in the
Physics Department at Stanford.
Pollard joined Ananda Marga in the
early 1970s while a student at
Southern Illinois University. She
said she was dissatisfied with other
forms of meditation and her Baptist
upbringing. "Something was mis
sing," she said.
Ananda Marga meditation was
more effective and satisfying for Pol
lard than other types such as
transcendental meditation. "I think
it's the best," she said, but hesitated
in trying to describe the experience
further. "It's going inside and asking
'Who am I?' " she said finally.
Like other active members of
Ananda Marga, Pollard meditates at
least twice each day, in the morning
before driving to Stanford and later
in the evening. The meditation pro
vides a spiritual foundation for her
life, Pollard said, adding that it
makes her feel more secure and
relaxed at work, especially "when
things get really hectic."
"The social aspects of Ananda
Marga [are] also very important to
me," she added.
The Ananda Marga school in
structs about 25 kindergarten and
first grade children, most of whose
parents are not members of Ananda

Marga. In addition to providing a
basic academic curriculum, the
sponsors of the school say they also
teach the children basic meditation
techniques and "spiritual morality."
"We teach that the world is God's
creation,'' said Didi Svati, another
full-time staff worker for Ananda
Marga. Svati, who was raised in a
Catholic family in Holland, said she
believes it is important to teach
people to live on a spiritual base.
"Thousands of years ago, people
spent their energies struggling for
basic physical survival," Svati said.
She explained that just as man
progressed from that level to a new
era of intellectual pursuits marked
by the French Renaissance and the
scientific explosion, so now
humanity stands on the threshold of
another time, where spiritual issues
will dominate.

"We don't tell
people who are
hungry, 'Oh, go
and meditate and
all your problems
will be solved,'
Svati said.

The danger for today's society,
Svati said, is that people are dab
bling in spiritual phenomena, such
as extra-sensory perception, without
real knowledge of what they're
doing. "When people don't get the
proper (moral) guidance," she said,
"they get into trouble."
The role of the Ananda Marga
movement in this transition to a new
era of spirituality, said Svati, is not
especially critical. "What is happen
ing here is happening regardless of
what we are doing."
What, then, is the function of
Ananda Marga? Svati sees Ananda
Marga providing positive solutions
to a world she claims is dominated
by "negativity."
"We always know what is wrong"
in the world, she explained, citing
the injustices of the South African
apartheid regime and the U.S. in
volvement in Vietnam in the 19705.
Ananda Marga hopes to offer a plan
for man to "create a better system,
where everybody gets a chance to
work out his full potential," she
added.
The key to the Ananda Marga
plan seems to lie in meditation. "If
we want to make this a better world,
we have to start from within," Svati
said. "Outer change has to be based
on inner change.
"We have to spend a certain
amount of time inside, otherwise we

burn out, like a wax candle," Svati
said. "I have to first find love and my
true self inside, then bring it out."
Svati also stressed the importance
of service as the natural and neces
sary consequence of successful med
itation. People are "so self centered
here (in the United States)," she
said, and suggested that a great deal
of mental illness in this country
would be prevented if people pushed
their focuses outward, helping
others and healing themselves in the
process.
"We don't tell people who are
hungry, 'Oh, go and meditate and
all your problems will be solved,' "
Svati said.
The Ananda Marga version of
meditation is based on a mantra, a
group of syllables that are repeated,
either aloud or silently. For most of
the members and workers, the
repetition of the mantra is main
tained between 30 minutes and an
hour.
Unlike many other forms of med
itation, the Ananda Marga mantras
have meaning, Tabha said, adding
that they have an especially effective
aural influence on the mind and are
coordinated with the meditator's
breathing patterns to enhance con
centration and focus. For example,
the rough translation of their five
syllable general mantra, "Baba Nam
Kevalam," is, "Everything is the in
finite consciousness."
It is by coming to know this infin
ite or supreme consciousness,
Tabha said, that spiritual maturity is
approached.
The effect of Ananda Marga med
itation, according to those who
practice it, is a satisfaction that
emerges from closeness to the su
preme consciousness. "What
results," Tabha said, "is a sense of
peace . . . not death, but the com
plete satisfaction of all your desires."
The Sanskrit words "Ananda
Marga," not unexpectedly, mean
"path of bliss."
Tabha graduated from Stanford in
1967, when his name was still Alan
Price. He was a history major and
member of the Chi Psi fraternity.
Like most of the American-born
members of Ananda Marga, Price
experienced college in the shadow of
Vietnam and the purported il
lumination of hallucinogenic drugs.
"We were hunting the possibili
ties of the human experience,"
Tabha said. "I was attending every
thing from encounter groups to yoga
classes," he added.
The Ananda Marga movement,
founded by P.R. Sarkar, offered for
Tabha the most effective meditation
he had been able to find.
Tabha and all full-time staff
workers are expected to meditate at
least four times every day, using a
personal, two syllable mantra.
While he would not reveal the

mantra itself, Tabha explained that
most of the personal mantras carry
the general translation: "I am one
with the supreme consciousness."
Ananda Marga may start a student
group on campus soon, according to
Ragu, a member and an auditor at
Encina Hall at Stanford.
"What we offer is a way of life, a
natural path to spiritual growth,"
said Dada Ratneshvarananda, a staff
worker from India.
"The yoga exercises, the fasting
— these are not religion," he said.
"Everything has a scientific base. It's
not based on faith."
Ratneshvarananda and Svati both
agreed that the Ananda Marga phil
osophy distinguished itself from reli
gion by its "practicality."
Followers of Ananda Marga ex
press confidence in the eventual
progress of man to maturity. When
challenged with the thought that a
nuclear war could extinguish
humanity before such a spiritual
maturity was reached, Svati
responded she could not believe that
God would make a world only to
destroy it.

"God has created this world with
a purpose,'' she said. "I'm sure we're
going to get through all of this.
Maybe with pain, but we will get
through."
Svati, like Pollard and Tabha, was
raised in a Christian environment.
She sees a great deal of truth in the
Christian teachings of her youth,
but says she believes that Cat
holicism and religion in general
have become exploitative. "There
are a lot of very good Christians who
live (the Bible) out in their hearts —
I don't see much difference between
them and us."
"But why go back to Jesus," she
said, "when there is a great teacher
right here?" referring to the founder
Sarkar, who is still living and teach
ing in Ananda Marga.
"Over time we'll be able to prove
to people that what we believe
makes sense," she said. But if a new
spiritual era should arrive, what
would follow? Svati admitted she
didn't know.
"God is so amazing," she said,
"that we can't predict what's out
there still."
