## Eurythmics earn top praise 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
While Berkeley is not my favorite city (for reasons far
and wide removed from the somewhat trumped-up Big
Game rivalry), 1 decided that for a chance to see the
Eurythmics, I would tolerate an evening there — one of
the wiser decisions I have made in a long time.
If I were using the four-star rating system of most
reviewers, I would have to give the Eurythmics' lead
singer Annie Lennox a resounding five stars for her per
formance last Saturday evening in the Greek Theatre.
Singing with a lure more powerful than ever a siren pos
sessed, she delighted my ears as her very presence did
the same for my eyes.
1 have to remark that after the opening band, a duet
featuring Jim Nabors and Slim Whitman would have
sounded melodic. He called himself Jean Beauvoir, or
something close to that. He wore a foot-high platinum
mohawk and sang very poorly. Don't hire him — not
even to play a youngster's birthday party.
However, this is not meant to detract in the slightest
from the Eurythmics' performance. In fact, the effect
was quite the reverse. In the Shakespearean tradition of
"tempering extremities with extreme sweet," you can't
imagine how happy the crowd was to see Jean stop

brewing his foul batch of tongue soup and relinquish the
stage to its rightful owner, Annie Lennox.
Now, I do not mean to take anything away from the
other members of the Eurythmics, but anyone who does
not credit Lennox with at least 90 percent of the stage
magic did not see the same concert that I did. Sure,
Dave Stewart was excellent on guitar as were the back

up vocalists and the woodwind player, but it was still
Annie Lennox who played the proverbial clean-up hitter
in bringing the crowd to its feet and beyond.
Opening fantastically with "1984 (Sexcrime)" off of
the album of the same title, the Eurythmics instantly set
the crowd ablaze. The following numbers including
"Here Comes the Rain," "Who's That Girl?" and
"Would I Lie to You" (to name a few) only added fuel to
the fire.
The aspect of the performance that I found most en
joyable, aside from the well-selected repertoire, was the
interaction that each performer enjoyed with the crowd.
From each musician's instrumental solos to Lennox's
spot-lighted ballads, the emphasis was on playing to the
people, and they, in turn, responded — some even to
excess.
I was pleased to see, or rather hear, that Lennox and
Stewart, the two principle members of the Eurythmics,
pulled songs from their many albums in creating one of
the finest shows I have ever seen.
While most of the songs followed the standard album
format, Lennox and Stewart improvised marvelously
with "Sweet Dreams," "Who's That Girl?" and others to
give you a feeling that you were getting more from them
than you could possibly get from simply listening to an
album.
This expressiveness was complemented nicely by
Lennox's ability to use the entire stage in her act. Al
though she is not the most sensational dancer in the
world of music, there is definitely something in her
movement that makes her a pleasure to see. Perhaps her
secret lies in her uniqueness . . . I'm not certain, but
whatever she has, I like it — a lot.
Just in case you have not figured this out by now, this
is a strong recommendation to see the Eurythmics the
next time they tour. If they are half as entertaining and
energetic as they were Saturday, you will still be getting
twice your money's worth.
If Annie Lennox is reading this, my phone number is
723-4632. Please leave a message.


The Eurythmics' lead singer Annie Lennox and guitarist Dave Stewart bring the crowd closer to the celestial. The
Eurythmics played before a capacity crowd at the Greek Theatre last Saturday night.
