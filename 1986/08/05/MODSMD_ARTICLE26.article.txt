# The
						Nine offers a unique brand of fun
## 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
Between the blocks of Sixth
and Eleventh in San Francisco,
there are perhaps 20 nightclubs
all claiming to be the ultimate
dance experience. So, how can
you spot The Nine?
Well, if you're driving up
Ninth Street (it's one way, by the
way) and you see a building
painted more colorfully than a
New York City subway and emit
ting quality music, chances are
you've found The Nine — one of
the most diverse clubs in San
Francisco.

Being divided by a seemingly
soundproof wall, The Nine is ac
tually two clubs in one. While
one side is playing music that in
cludes future, current and classic
dance tracks, the other could be
featuring anything from a psyche
delic synthesizer show to an up
beat South American band.
Within only a few steps you can
switch scenes, sometimes by 180
degrees. At times the music on
side one (the dance side) will get
too rap funky for my tastes, but
this condition is by no means the
norm.
Also, by sponsoring weekly
events such as comedy night and
Dangergirl (one of the funnest
disc jockies in the City), The
Nine manages to further increase
its entertainment potential.
Because the club is not very
large and the ceilings are not very
high, it tends to get crowded and
hot, especially on weekends. This
can sometimes be frustrating
when a prime song comes on and
people are shouldering you on all
sides, but such are the trials and
tribulations that one must bear.
While large crowds do not
bother me, I cannot tolerate it
when people just stand in the
middle of the dance floor and rap
about the fine weather we're
having. If you are standing on the
dance floor, don't take it so
lightly. The least you can do is
dance — or make a sincere at
tempt, as the case may be.
One reason why I find myself
returning to The Nine while
most clubs run dry after only a
few visits is that there is no stan
dard image there. People do not

behave along prescribed lines. In
fact, I found the crowd to be one
of the best behaved of any club.
I cannot make any sweeping
generalizations about the crowd
simply because such a move
would leave at least some faction
untouched. A prime example of
this is the case of dancing skill.
While some progressive clubs
boast a clientele of accomplished
dancers, the people here have
varied dancing styles and skill
levels.
You will find people dressed in
anything from semi-formal wear
to shorts and baggy T-shirt. The
two extremes in city attire — the
yuppie on the right and the un
derground or post-progressive on
the left — are not generally pres
ent.
Although the scene can be
somewhat "pick-uppy" at times,
it is not the most pronounced
feature of the setting. People
seem to be more relaxed in both
attitude and attire than they are
in most Bay Area clubs. This is
probably why the mellow or
"chill" side, as it is commonly
called, of The Nine is so popular,
especially toward the end of the
evening.
It is this relaxed atmosphere
that makes The Nine such an
ideal choice when you have to
accommodate the interests of
many people on the ever-popular
group outing to San Francisco.
For the person who likes his or
her tea, there are three bars that
make getting a drink a matter of
convenience rather than the
time-consuming drudge it can be
at some clubs.
Another amenity at The Nine
that I have taken advantage of on
occasion is the fact that the club
serves food until the wee hours of
the morning, and surprisingly
enough, the hamburgers are
really tasty. While this can never
take the place of a trip to one of
the many late night cafes
throughout the City, it is nice to
have the option.
I like to use The Nine as a ne
cessary break after a spree of very
hard-core progressive outings. It
provides a comfortable dancing
atmosphere without being overly
flirtatious with dreaded main
stream conceptions of fun. Even
if you don't think The Nine is
your scene, I would suggest you
try it.
After all, just as San Francisco
is a city of many faces, The Nine
is a club with the ability to suit
many tastes.
