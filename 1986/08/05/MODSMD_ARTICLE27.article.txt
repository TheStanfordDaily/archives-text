## Titanic Tyson takes boxing's top billing 
### ERIC HEALY Staff writer 
I have decided what the next clas
sic match-up in the boxing world
should be: Mike Tyson vs. the
Sasquatch.
Sportswriters are calling him
(Tyson, not the Sasquatch) every
thing from a human wrecking ma
chine to a face compactor. I believe
these are all understatements. If
Secretary of the Navy John Lehman
would name the next commissioned
destroyer the S.S. Tyson, then I
think we would be on the right
track.

COMMENTARY

The fact is Tyson has not suffered
one loss as a professional and, most
recently, has torn through the top
heavyweight contenders, silencing
all the critics who initially came out
against him.
In his last three fights, he has
proven that not only can he go the
distance, but also that he can bang
out opponents before they even have
a chance to break a sweat.
After silencing Carl "The Truth"
Williams with a sixth round upper
cut that worked Williams' head like
a speedbag, Tyson went on to win a
unanimous decision over James
"The Quick" Tillis and just 10 days
ago he sent Marvis Frazier to la-la
land 30 seconds into the first round.
Why doesn't Joe take his son out of
boxing before the poor lad's brain
becomes a slang term for a Denny's
breakfast special? If it is a question of
money, take up a collection. I'll

contribute all I can.
While I will concede that the
current heavyweight ranks are not as
competitive as they once were, I still
have grave reservations, other than
those of personal health, about dis
crediting any of Tyson's perfor
mances. George Foreman (now over
40 years old), who took the title from
Ali only to return it in their famous
rematch, said recently that the
heavyweight division is so full of
bums that if he came out of retire
ment, he would still be sitting on top
of the show. Yeah . . . right,
George.
The most remarkable aspect of
Tyson's performances to me is the
sheer force with which he hits. Op
ponents literally cannot get to the
canvas fast enough when he
powerdrives them into another
galaxy of twirling stars and ringing
ears. It has been a long time since
we have seen a heavyweight with so
much power and determination.
Experts are already saying that he
hits harder than "Smoking" Joe
Frazier did in his prime. There is a
twofold scariness to that statement:
Tyson can overmatch the power in
Frazier's infamous left hook with
traditionally less forceful punches
(i.e., his straight right), and he is
only 19 years old and not likely at
his prime.
If he gets any better, they had bet
ter start bringing bodybags to his
fights, but in the meantime, I would
like to make it the official responsi
bility of the Surgeon General to knit
Tyson a pair of trunks with a label
reading, "Warning: Exchanging
punches with this man can be men
tally corrosive â€” fatal, even."

Taking into account his cakewalk
through some of the "finest"
heavyweights in the world, one can
not help asking what is next for Mike
Tyson? The obvious, of course, is a
title shot at Michael Spinks for the
World Heavyweight Boxing Cham
pionship.
I can see it all now. It will be held
at, where else, Caesar's Palace. It
will receive the classic billing of the

boxer vs. the puncher, and Spinks
will kiss the mat early and hard.
How can anyone predict other
wise? If Spinks had to bulk up to get
enough power to fight Holmes dis
putably close, how can he be ex
pected to fend off the likes of a
freight train like Tyson. Spinks' only
chance at not ending up with a
