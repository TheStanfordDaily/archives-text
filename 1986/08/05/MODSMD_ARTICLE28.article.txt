# USFL to cancel '86 season
## 
### 
NEW YORK - United
States Football League club
owners voted yesterday to
suspend play, probably until
1987, less than a week after
being awarded only $3 in da
mages in their $1.69 billion
antitrust suit against the Na
tional Football League.
The eight-team league,
which operated for three years
with a spring-summer
schedule, was to have opened
its first fall schedule Sept. 13.
Commissioner Harry Usher
said the USFL would seek an
injunction asking that the
NFL be required to drop one
of its three network television
contracts.
He said the league also
would seek a new hearing on
damages because of what it
considered to be the confusion
of some jurors in reaching a
decision in that aspect of the
case.
"Because of the un
believable impossibility of ef
fectively playing pro football
without a television agreement
with a network, we are
postponing play until we get
either injunctive relief or the
confusion on the verdict allev
iated," Usher said.
The commissioner said a
committee would be formed
to work out an agreement with
the players' union on existing
player contracts.
