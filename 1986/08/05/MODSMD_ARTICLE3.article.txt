# Davies motion considered
## University seeks to disqualify tenure lawsuit 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
A Santa Clara County judge is
considering two motions by Stanford
to dismiss a case brought by Visiting
Prof. Norman Davies that charges
the University denied him a tenured
professorship because of his political
beliefs.
The University filed a demurrer
June 30 asking the court to rule
Davies has no cause of action in the
case. It also filed a motion for a pro
tective order requesting the court to
dismiss the case because of the con
fidentiality of tenure-related issues.
The judge has 90 days from the date
of filing to rule on the motions.
Davies, a tenured professor of
East European History at the Uni
versity' of London, filed a $3.1 mil
lion lawsuit against 31 members of
the History Department in May â€”
four months after he was denied the
position by a 12-11 vote of tenured

history professors. Davies charged
that members of the department
conspired to deny him tenure be
cause of what they considered anti-
Semitic material in his recent book,
"God's Playground: A History of
Poland."
The University and professors im
plicated in the case have maintained
that the suit is without merit, but in
a court memorandum submitted bv

Davies, he says two professors
referred to the vote as a
"conspiracy." The memorandum
also states that two other professors
criticized the conduct of History
Prof. Harold Kahn, the only defen
dant specifically named in the suit.
"I'm sure that Kahn organized the
whole thing," said History Prof.
Lewis Spitz, according to the docu
ment. "(Kahn's) political, he's not
an intellectual. He shouldn't be in a
university."
Criticism that Davies' scholarship
was "uncritical," "advocatory" and
"non-explanatory" was directed spe
cifically at his writings on Polish-
Jewish relations, Slavic Studies
Chairman Richard Schupbach said,
according to the memorandum.
According to the document, Spitz
said History Department Chairman
Paul Robinson began an investiga
tion of an alleged conspiracy against
