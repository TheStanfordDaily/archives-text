# Gays move against La Rouche measure
## 
### MARTHA MOODY Staff writer 
A member of the Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS)
has co-fonnded a group to defeat
a Lyndon Laßouche-sponsored
initiative that could prevent
AIDS victims from attending
school, traveling and holding cer
tain jobs.
GLAS member Will Doherty
and Mountain View resident
Tcdd Siegel have formed Penin
sula No On 64 — a local chapter
of a state-wide organization, to
educate organizations and indi
viduals on what they see as the
dangers of the Laßouche mea
sure.
Proposition 64, an initiative
that will appear on the California
ballot Nov. 4, defines AIDS as an
"infectious, contagious and com
municable condition. " If the ini

tiative passes, the California
Health and Safety Code would
require citizens to report people
stricken with AIDS to local
health authorities.
Under the initiative, it would
he illegal for a person suspected
of being infected with AIDS to at
tend school or to work as a food
handler. In addition, the initia
tive would allow the government
to isolate, quarantine or "take
control of the body of' any infec
ted person, as well as destroy any
of his property that cannot be
safely disinfected.
Peninsula No On 64 plans to
conduct a massive voter registra
tion drive during the first week of
fall quarter in order to register as
many opponents of the initiative
as possible before the early Octo
ber deadline for registering to
vote in the election.
The group also hopes to persuade
members of the Stanford faculty to
adopt a resolution against the initia
tive, Doherty said.
According to Doherty, members
of Peninsula No On 64 are con
cerned that even in the absence of
medical evidence, persons who are
suspected of having the AIDS vims

will lose their jobs or their right to
attend school. He said persons who
were known to have been exposed to
AIDS could be treated as suspects
under the new law.
Because the initiative could affect
such a large number of people, "this
is not simply a gay male issue,"
Doherty said.
U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) and his Republican op
ponent, Rep. Ed Zschau of Los
Altos, have both signed a document
opposing the initiative, as has Glad
den Elliot, president of the Califor

nia Medical Association.
The San Francisco Labor Coun
cil has also adopted a resolution
against the measure. Doherty said
his group hopes to enlist the support
of other unions, especially food
workers unions and health workers
unions.
Evidence presented by Dr. Edgar
Engelman of the Stanford Medical
Center in the March edition of The
Student Body, a Cowell Student
Health Center publication, suggests
that the AIDS virus is not highly
contagious. As of March 1986, he

found "no reported cases of full
blown AIDS among health care
workers in the United States
[related] specifically to occupational
exposure."
Health care workers should be at a
particularly high risk because they
are exposed to the victims' body
fluids through which the virus is
spread. It is believed that the virus
can only be transmitted through a
transfer of these body fluids.
Once a person contracts the virus
(HIV), he or she has a 5 to 20 per
cent chance of developing AIDS

and a 30 to 40 percent chance of de
veloping AIDS-Related Complex
Laßouche's National Democratic
Policy Committee argues in its
literature that the existing public
health codes should be extended to
protect people from AIDS, "\Vie
gravest public health threat our na
tion has ever faced. "
Members of Peninsula No On 64
think Laßouche and his supporters
are "playing off the fears of the
public in order for them to gain poli
tical clout and financial advantage,''
Doherty said.
