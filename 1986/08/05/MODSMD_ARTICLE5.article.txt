### MIMI GASICH 
After pedaling nearly 3,000 miles, the /0
bicyclists on the five different routes of Bike-
Aid are meeting in the nation's capital today to
finish the final leg of their cross-country trek to
New York City.
All of the riders, including 16 Stanford stu
dents who left here June 14, are still riding. "1
never seriously thought of quitting," said rider
John L,ake, a Stanford senior. "I've been learn
ing a lot and having a great time.
"The philosophy and important programs of
ODN (the Overseas Development Network)
make me proud to be part of this ride, ex
plained rider Robbie Carson, a junior at Stan

ford. "T he people s reception along the way
has been the best aspect of the ride. Rural
America is a special place."
Bike-A id was created last year by Stanford
students Nazir Ahmed and Shaun Skclton to
"touch mainstream America personally,' said
Ahmed. A fund-raising and educational out
reach effort, Bike-Aid has become a way to get
Americans involved in helping people in de
veloping countries help themselves to improve
their living conditions.
Bikers arc following one of five different
routes. Groups started their journeys from San
Francisco, the Los Angeles-San Diego area,
Seattle, Wash., Portland, Ore., and Houston,
Texas. All the bikers will finish together on

August 11 in New York City with a welcome
from Mayor Fd Koch and a partv hosted bv
UNICEF.
Organizers say today s union in Washing
ton, DC., appropriately symbolizes the
central concept motivating the bikers.
Through "tolerance of different needs,
cultures and routes, we can rcach the same
goal," Ahmed said.
One of the primary goals of Bike-Aid is to
educate as many communities as possible
about issues of national development. The
multiple routes were designed so that riders
would go through different parts of the
country , reaching out to people through ODN
slide presentations and discussions. When the

ride is over, the bicyclists will have covered 38
states and 250 different communities.
"We want to stress human dignity and
change the paradigm from charity to partner
ship and responsibility," said Ahmed, who is
the co-founder of ODN.
During their stops, the riders have also
spent some time volunteering in food
kitchens. Some town mayors along the various
routes welcomed the bicyclists to their towns
by declaring Global Partnership Day when
they rode in.
The main source of help for the program
has come from ODN, a national group of col-
