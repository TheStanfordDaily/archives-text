# Bike-Aid riders pedal final leg of cross-country trek
## 
### MIMI GASICH 
After pedaling nearly 3,000 miles, the /0
bicyclists on the five different routes of Bike-
Aid are meeting in the nation's capital today to
finish the final leg of their cross-country trek to
New York City.
All of the riders, including 16 Stanford stu
dents who left here June 14, are still riding. "1
never seriously thought of quitting," said rider
John L,ake, a Stanford senior. "I've been learn
ing a lot and having a great time.
"The philosophy and important programs of
ODN (the Overseas Development Network)
make me proud to be part of this ride, ex
plained rider Robbie Carson, a junior at Stan

ford. "T he people s reception along the way
has been the best aspect of the ride. Rural
America is a special place."
Bike-A id was created last year by Stanford
students Nazir Ahmed and Shaun Skclton to
"touch mainstream America personally,' said
Ahmed. A fund-raising and educational out
reach effort, Bike-Aid has become a way to get
Americans involved in helping people in de
veloping countries help themselves to improve
their living conditions.
Bikers arc following one of five different
routes. Groups started their journeys from San
Francisco, the Los Angeles-San Diego area,
Seattle, Wash., Portland, Ore., and Houston,
Texas. All the bikers will finish together on

August 11 in New York City with a welcome
from Mayor Fd Koch and a partv hosted bv
UNICEF.
Organizers say today s union in Washing
ton, DC., appropriately symbolizes the
central concept motivating the bikers.
Through "tolerance of different needs,
cultures and routes, we can rcach the same
goal," Ahmed said.
One of the primary goals of Bike-Aid is to
educate as many communities as possible
about issues of national development. The
multiple routes were designed so that riders
would go through different parts of the
country , reaching out to people through ODN
slide presentations and discussions. When the

ride is over, the bicyclists will have covered 38
states and 250 different communities.
"We want to stress human dignity and
change the paradigm from charity to partner
ship and responsibility," said Ahmed, who is
the co-founder of ODN.
During their stops, the riders have also
spent some time volunteering in food
kitchens. Some town mayors along the various
routes welcomed the bicyclists to their towns
by declaring Global Partnership Day when
they rode in.
The main source of help for the program
has come from ODN, a national group of col-
lege students who work to educate
campuses and then organize projects
to help development around the
world. Both ODN and Bike-Aid are
headquartered at Stanford, and the
ride was coordinated primarily by
Stanford students.
"We couldn't have done it with
out the help of Stanford," said Stan
ford volunteer Michael House.
"The project wouldn't have been
feasible without the free phone lines
and office space from the Univer
sity."
Ahmed agreed the University has
been particularly supportive.
"President Donald Kennedy has
been a better help than we could ex
pect. He's taken an active interest in
our project. He's not just lending his
name," Ahmed said.
Coordinators have spent endless
hours on the phone setting up con
tacts along the routes to get free ac
commodations. Riders have stayed
in motels, churches, campgrounds,
private homes and anywhere else
they could find temporary lodging.
"Safeway . . . has been a great
help along the way, providing food,
contacting the media and setting up
riders as volunteers in food banks,"
Ahmed said.
"It's nice to see that there are a lot
of people in America who care
about what we are doing," Skelton
said. "They've done so much. The
whole country deserves a big thank
you."

The bicyclists each originally
hoped to raise $3,000 through
pledges-per-mile, but they've had to
lower their sights. "Now we're ex
pecting to raise $100,000 if all the
pledges come in," said Jenny Stine,
a Stanford volunteer.
The money raised will be dis
tributed as follows: 50 percent to
ODN-sponsored self-help projects
in Africa, Asia and Latin America;
30 percent to other national groups
sharing ODN's self-help philosophy;
10 percent to projects in the United
States; and 10 percent to a fellow
ship program enabling college stu
dents to volunteer with overseas de
velopment projects.
Bike-Aid has been successful in
touching many people across
America.
Organizers and volunteers are
already looking forward to Bike-Aid
'87. "We're ready to do it again next
year,'' Skelton said. "We've
definitely built up our contacts and
we are prepared for next year."
No major changes are anticipated
for next year's program, but or
ganizers hope to expand the routes
and increase the number of riders
and amount of money raised. Ac
cording to Ahmed, a Canadian
route may be added. But more vol
unteers will be needed beginning in
the fall when plans for Bike-Aid '87
begin.
"I would recommend that people
get involved," said rider Lisa Wolf, a
Stanford senior. "The ride is real
doable for anyone and it's a great ex
perience. I'm never going to forget
it."

'87. "We're ready to do it again next
year,'' Skelton said. "We've
definitely built up our contacts and
we are prepared for next year."
No major changes are anticipated
for next year's program, but or
ganizers hope to expand the routes
and increase the number of riders
and amount of money raised. Ac
cording to Ahmed, a Canadian
route may be added. But more vol
unteers will be needed beginning in
the fall when plans for Bike-Aid '87
begin.
"I would recommend that people
get involved," said rider Lisa Wolf, a
Stanford senior. "The ride is real
doable for anyone and it's a great ex
perience. I'm never going to forget
it."
After pedaling nearly 3,000 miles, the /0
bicyclists on the five different routes of Bike-
Aid are meeting in the nation's capital today to
finish the final leg of their cross-country trek to
New York City.
All of the riders, including 16 Stanford stu
dents who left here June 14, are still riding. "1
never seriously thought of quitting," said rider
John L,ake, a Stanford senior. "I've been learn
ing a lot and having a great time.
"The philosophy and important programs of
ODN (the Overseas Development Network)
make me proud to be part of this ride, ex
plained rider Robbie Carson, a junior at Stan

ford. "T he people s reception along the way
has been the best aspect of the ride. Rural
America is a special place."
Bike-A id was created last year by Stanford
students Nazir Ahmed and Shaun Skclton to
"touch mainstream America personally,' said
Ahmed. A fund-raising and educational out
reach effort, Bike-Aid has become a way to get
Americans involved in helping people in de
veloping countries help themselves to improve
their living conditions.
Bikers arc following one of five different
routes. Groups started their journeys from San
Francisco, the Los Angeles-San Diego area,
Seattle, Wash., Portland, Ore., and Houston,
Texas. All the bikers will finish together on

August 11 in New York City with a welcome
from Mayor Fd Koch and a partv hosted bv
UNICEF.
Organizers say today s union in Washing
ton, DC., appropriately symbolizes the
central concept motivating the bikers.
Through "tolerance of different needs,
cultures and routes, we can rcach the same
goal," Ahmed said.
One of the primary goals of Bike-Aid is to
educate as many communities as possible
about issues of national development. The
multiple routes were designed so that riders
would go through different parts of the
country , reaching out to people through ODN
slide presentations and discussions. When the

ride is over, the bicyclists will have covered 38
states and 250 different communities.
"We want to stress human dignity and
change the paradigm from charity to partner
ship and responsibility," said Ahmed, who is
the co-founder of ODN.
During their stops, the riders have also
spent some time volunteering in food
kitchens. Some town mayors along the various
routes welcomed the bicyclists to their towns
by declaring Global Partnership Day when
they rode in.
The main source of help for the program
has come from ODN, a national group of col-
lege students who work to educate
campuses and then organize projects
to help development around the
world. Both ODN and Bike-Aid are
headquartered at Stanford, and the
ride was coordinated primarily by
Stanford students.
"We couldn't have done it with
out the help of Stanford," said Stan
ford volunteer Michael House.
"The project wouldn't have been
feasible without the free phone lines
and office space from the Univer
sity."
Ahmed agreed the University has
been particularly supportive.
"President Donald Kennedy has
been a better help than we could ex
pect. He's taken an active interest in
our project. He's not just lending his
name," Ahmed said.
Coordinators have spent endless
hours on the phone setting up con
tacts along the routes to get free ac
commodations. Riders have stayed
in motels, churches, campgrounds,
private homes and anywhere else
they could find temporary lodging.
"Safeway . . . has been a great
help along the way, providing food,
contacting the media and setting up
riders as volunteers in food banks,"
Ahmed said.
"It's nice to see that there are a lot
of people in America who care
about what we are doing," Skelton
said. "They've done so much. The
whole country deserves a big thank
you."

The bicyclists each originally
hoped to raise $3,000 through
pledges-per-mile, but they've had to
lower their sights. "Now we're ex
pecting to raise $100,000 if all the
pledges come in," said Jenny Stine,
a Stanford volunteer.
The money raised will be dis
tributed as follows: 50 percent to
ODN-sponsored self-help projects
in Africa, Asia and Latin America;
30 percent to other national groups
sharing ODN's self-help philosophy;
10 percent to projects in the United
States; and 10 percent to a fellow
ship program enabling college stu
dents to volunteer with overseas de
velopment projects.
Bike-Aid has been successful in
touching many people across
America.
