# Cranston praises toxics bill
## Senator meets press, says he's eager to debate Zschau 
### TRACY FURUTANI Staff writer 
SAN JOSE â€” U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) announced his support for a compromise Super
fund renewal bill in a brief and sparsely-attended press
conference Saturday morning.
"With the renewal of Superfund, the Environmental
Protection Agency will have the muscle to clean up the
19 worst sites in Santa Clara County," he said.
The bill, a compromise worked out between the
House and the Senate last week after six months of ne
gotiations, asks for $9 billion in federal money to clean
up 375 sites nationally over five years.
He praised a "community right to know" provision in
the bill that would require businesses to notify the
public of hazardous emissions by their firms. He also
applauded another provision permitting lawsuits against
offending businesses.
Cranston, who faces a re-election battle against Re
publican nominee Rep. Ed Zschau of Los Altos,
delivered his remarks in front of the Santa Clara County
Administration Building.
Cranston called on his opponent to join in support of
the legislation when it comes before Congress next
week.
Cranston also expressed a desire to meet Zschau in a
face-to-face debate. "It's up to the Zschau campaign,"
he said when asked why no firm plans for the debates
had been made.
Cranston noted that 12 organizations were interested
in sponsoring the much-discussed debates, but he added
that no times or locations for the debates had been set.
The debate issue was also taken up by an audience
member who wore a chicken suit with a sign reading,
"Cranston: Why won't you debate Zschau?"
Cranston said that he expected this Senate campaign
to be the second most expensive Senate race ever,
topped only by the 1984 Senate race in North Carolina.

"If Zschau spends $12 million, we'll be ready to
match that," said Cranston.
Cranston reiterated his support for federal financial
aid for students. "My record has been that I've always
been in favor of student aid programs," he said.
Though he said that there were no aid package bills
outstanding in Congress, he would support an extension
of the Guaranteed Student Loan program "when it
comes up. "
